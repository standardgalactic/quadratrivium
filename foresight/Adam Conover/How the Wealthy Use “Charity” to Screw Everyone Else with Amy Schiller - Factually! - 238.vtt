00:00.000 --> 00:01.440
Hello, and welcome to Factually.

00:01.440 --> 00:02.320
I'm Adam Conover.

00:02.320 --> 00:04.080
Thank you so much for joining me on the show again.

00:04.080 --> 00:05.560
You know, it's giving season,

00:05.560 --> 00:07.240
and if you're like me, you might be wondering,

00:07.240 --> 00:09.640
where the hell should I give my money?

00:09.640 --> 00:11.840
I mean, you want to make the world a better place, right?

00:11.840 --> 00:14.240
But it's difficult to know what charity

00:14.240 --> 00:15.960
or organization to donate to

00:15.960 --> 00:17.600
that's actually going to make a difference,

00:17.600 --> 00:18.840
especially because, you know,

00:18.840 --> 00:20.400
we've got a world full of billionaires

00:20.400 --> 00:21.960
donating money all the time,

00:21.960 --> 00:24.400
and the world doesn't actually seem to be getting better, right?

00:24.400 --> 00:28.200
So how do we actually make an improvement with our money?

00:28.200 --> 00:29.520
Well, a couple years ago,

00:29.520 --> 00:31.800
a savior emerged in the form of a movement

00:31.800 --> 00:33.920
called effective altruism.

00:33.920 --> 00:37.360
This was a group of scientists, philosophers, and researchers

00:37.360 --> 00:39.400
who pledged to use their huge brains

00:39.400 --> 00:43.040
to figure out what the most effective forms of charity were.

00:43.040 --> 00:46.000
They did rigorous research, they conducted studies,

00:46.000 --> 00:47.320
they held conferences,

00:47.320 --> 00:49.920
and they convinced a lot of very rich people

00:49.920 --> 00:51.840
to donate huge amounts of money

00:51.840 --> 00:53.640
for the betterment of humanity.

00:53.640 --> 00:56.200
It seemed like a really great thing

00:56.200 --> 00:57.720
until a couple years later

00:57.720 --> 00:59.880
when the entire movement collapsed.

00:59.880 --> 01:02.760
It turns out they got into bed with the crypto fraudsters

01:02.760 --> 01:04.160
like Sam Bankman Freed,

01:04.160 --> 01:06.560
and now the entire philosophical movement

01:06.560 --> 01:10.640
behind effective altruism has been largely discredited.

01:10.640 --> 01:11.720
How did this happen?

01:11.720 --> 01:13.160
How did a group of people

01:13.160 --> 01:14.920
dedicated to figuring out the best

01:14.920 --> 01:17.560
and most selfless ways to better humanity

01:17.560 --> 01:20.200
get embroiled in one of the largest financial frauds

01:20.200 --> 01:21.360
of all time?

01:21.360 --> 01:23.680
Is it even possible for philanthropy

01:23.680 --> 01:26.560
to do good in the world when things like this happen?

01:26.560 --> 01:29.840
And how can average people like you or me

01:29.840 --> 01:32.720
donate money to actually make the world

01:32.720 --> 01:35.000
a better place this giving season?

01:35.000 --> 01:36.720
Well, to answer these questions,

01:36.720 --> 01:39.360
we have an incredible guest on the show.

01:39.360 --> 01:40.960
But before we get to that, I wanna remind you

01:40.960 --> 01:42.280
that if you wanna support this show,

01:42.280 --> 01:44.240
you can do so on Patreon.

01:44.240 --> 01:46.480
Head to patreon.com slash Adam Conover.

01:46.480 --> 01:47.480
Just five bucks a month

01:47.480 --> 01:49.680

01:49.680 --> 01:51.240
and helps keep the podcast free

01:51.240 --> 01:53.680
for everyone else who wants to listen to it.

01:53.680 --> 01:54.680
I also wanna remind you,

01:54.680 --> 01:56.160
I am a touring standup comedian.

01:56.160 --> 01:57.800
If you wanna come see me in a city near you,

01:57.800 --> 02:00.120
I just announced a whole new set of tour dates.

02:00.120 --> 02:03.080
I'm going to New York, Philly, Atlanta, Boston,

02:03.080 --> 02:05.760
Nashville, DC, and a whole bunch more.

02:05.760 --> 02:08.920
Head to adamconover.net for tickets and tour dates.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.920
And now let's get to today's guest.

02:10.920 --> 02:12.440
Her name is Amy Schiller.

02:12.440 --> 02:13.960
She's a writer and academic

02:13.960 --> 02:16.320
who worked in the world of philanthropy for years.

02:16.320 --> 02:18.000
But now she has a new book out

02:18.000 --> 02:19.600
called The Price of Humanity,

02:19.600 --> 02:22.840
How Philanthropy Went Wrong and How to Fix It.

02:22.840 --> 02:25.520
It is such a smart and entertaining take

02:25.520 --> 02:28.080
on this entire industry and everything that plagues it

02:28.080 --> 02:30.800
and how you can actually make the world a better place.

02:30.800 --> 02:31.920
So without further ado,

02:31.920 --> 02:34.120
let's get to this interview with Amy Schiller.

02:36.680 --> 02:38.320
Amy, thank you so much for being on the show.

02:38.320 --> 02:39.680
It's such a pleasure to be here.

02:39.680 --> 02:41.520
I'm so excited to meet you.

02:41.520 --> 02:42.360
Oh, that's really nice.

02:42.360 --> 02:44.160
I'm very excited to meet you.

02:44.160 --> 02:48.200
Because I've been covering for a long time

02:48.200 --> 02:49.400
the problems with philanthropy.

02:49.400 --> 02:52.760
Philanthropy is proposed to us as this wonderful thing.

02:52.760 --> 02:54.440
It's how the rich change the world.

02:54.440 --> 02:55.400
You can do it yourself.

02:55.400 --> 02:56.360
You can contribute.

02:56.360 --> 02:59.880
What could possibly be bad about giving money away?

02:59.880 --> 03:01.720
You have written an entire book

03:01.720 --> 03:05.320
called The Price of Humanity, How Philanthropy Went Wrong.

03:05.320 --> 03:06.680
The entire thing.

03:06.680 --> 03:08.320
How did philanthropy go wrong?

03:08.320 --> 03:09.440
What is the problem with it?

03:09.440 --> 03:11.520
I'll tell you how I think philanthropy went wrong

03:11.520 --> 03:14.080
because you have very ably covered many ways

03:14.080 --> 03:14.920
that it's gone wrong.

03:14.920 --> 03:16.760
But here's what I think has gone wrong.

03:16.760 --> 03:21.760
It's drifted from the actual meaning of the word philanthropy.

03:22.360 --> 03:24.240
So for me, the entry point is

03:24.240 --> 03:27.440
philanthropy means love of humanity.

03:27.440 --> 03:31.040
And my concern is that I saw a lot of philanthropic

03:31.040 --> 03:35.080
movements and trends moving towards a definition

03:35.080 --> 03:38.960
of humanity that to me felt very narrow and reductive.

03:38.960 --> 03:42.640
So this all comes down to how we define humanity.

03:42.640 --> 03:46.920
Is humanity sustenance merely surviving?

03:46.920 --> 03:49.360
Or is humanity really about thriving

03:49.360 --> 03:52.120
and our full human capabilities to flourish

03:52.160 --> 03:55.640
and to create new things in common with one another?

03:55.640 --> 03:57.640
So my feeling is philanthropy went wrong

03:57.640 --> 04:00.800
when it started to become a utilitarian practice

04:00.800 --> 04:03.880
and not an enabler of human flourishing.

04:03.880 --> 04:05.560
And I think the word utilitarian

04:05.560 --> 04:07.960
is gonna come up a couple of times in this conversation.

04:07.960 --> 04:12.240
But what's an example of somebody getting that wrong

04:12.240 --> 04:13.920
so I can understand more better what you mean?

04:13.920 --> 04:15.040
Absolutely.

04:15.040 --> 04:19.000
Well, I'll jump into the sort of hot button version of it

04:19.000 --> 04:22.240
which is effective altruism embodied

04:22.240 --> 04:26.000
by now disgraced fraudster Sam Bankman-Freed

04:26.000 --> 04:28.760
but having a long trajectory before that,

04:28.760 --> 04:31.360
beginning as a philosophy that basically said,

04:32.440 --> 04:36.600
we can rank the moral worth of giving

04:36.600 --> 04:40.280
based on how many lives per dollar we save.

04:40.280 --> 04:44.720
So a very narrow definition of what constituted

04:44.720 --> 04:48.480
valid philanthropy and what philanthropy's purpose was.

04:48.520 --> 04:51.840
And let me say, I first encountered the idea

04:51.840 --> 04:54.920
of effective altruism close to 10 years ago.

04:54.920 --> 04:57.400
I actually, in my first show, Adam Ruins,

04:57.400 --> 05:01.000
everything had some effective altruism adjacent ideas.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.800
For instance, in our very first episode,

05:02.800 --> 05:03.920
which was called Adam Ruins Giving,

05:03.920 --> 05:05.720
it was the pilot of the whole show.

05:05.720 --> 05:08.320
We did a whole segment on how you shouldn't give food

05:08.320 --> 05:10.520
to food banks, you should give money to food banks

05:10.520 --> 05:13.040
because giving food makes you feel good.

05:13.040 --> 05:14.600
Giving money actually helps them the most

05:14.600 --> 05:15.580
because then they can buy the foods

05:15.580 --> 05:17.320
that people actually need.

05:17.320 --> 05:19.440
We made fun of Tom's shoes for giving away

05:19.440 --> 05:23.280
these free shoes when like, why not just give money, right?

05:23.280 --> 05:24.320
Why not give the thing?

05:24.320 --> 05:27.000
Why not trust people to make their own decisions?

05:27.000 --> 05:28.320
Absolutely.

05:28.320 --> 05:30.920
And I think there's a lot of validity to that.

05:30.920 --> 05:34.640
And it, I still think there is to some degree.

05:34.640 --> 05:39.640
It also dovetails with a very rigorous evidence-based approach

05:41.720 --> 05:43.960
that it's like, hey, if we actually,

05:43.960 --> 05:45.120
a lot of charity goes to waste,

05:45.160 --> 05:46.840
if you actually wanna make sure

05:46.840 --> 05:49.120
that the money that you donate goes to the right place,

05:49.120 --> 05:52.080
well, then you should be able to like really rigorously

05:52.080 --> 05:54.720
show that it has had a positive effect.

05:54.720 --> 05:56.040
There are groups like Givewell

05:56.040 --> 05:57.320
that would do these really rigorous studies.

05:57.320 --> 06:00.240
I would read them and look at their recommendations.

06:00.240 --> 06:01.920
And then it was all based on,

06:01.920 --> 06:04.600
yeah, the utilitarian philosophy of Peter Singer, right?

06:04.600 --> 06:07.000
Which is that, I mean, you can probably express it better

06:07.000 --> 06:09.920
than I can, but you know, the sort of general philosophy

06:09.920 --> 06:13.000
of like the ends are the most important thing.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.200
The number of lives saved, the amount of pain

06:15.200 --> 06:17.720
and suffering that you've prevented in the world.

06:17.720 --> 06:19.160
And I always knew, look,

06:19.160 --> 06:21.280
as the holder of a bachelor's in philosophy,

06:21.280 --> 06:23.120
I always knew there's no, you know,

06:23.120 --> 06:25.800
that philosophy isn't necessarily true in all respects,

06:25.800 --> 06:27.520
but it's defensible, right?

06:27.520 --> 06:28.520
It's respectable.

06:28.520 --> 06:30.320
There's a lot of validity to it.

06:30.320 --> 06:32.480
So I always enjoyed this sort of,

06:32.480 --> 06:35.000
oh, very rigorous view of philanthropy.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.240
And for a bunch of years, I would donate money

06:37.240 --> 06:39.560
according to the effective altruist donations

06:39.560 --> 06:41.800
to the Against Malaria Foundation.

06:41.800 --> 06:43.000
That was always the best ranked one.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.040
That was like for every couple thousand dollars

06:47.040 --> 06:47.960
you could save a life.

06:47.960 --> 06:50.240
And I was like, oh, I donated a couple thousand dollars.

06:50.240 --> 06:52.160
I think I saved one life.

06:52.160 --> 06:55.360
That was, I followed a lot of this.

06:55.360 --> 06:59.560
And now we're in a place where it's been entirely discredited

06:59.560 --> 07:01.560
because it got wrapped up in crypto

07:01.560 --> 07:03.080
and San Bank Manfred and AI

07:03.080 --> 07:04.840
and all these really weird practices.

07:04.840 --> 07:05.920
How did that happen?

07:05.920 --> 07:07.320
Okay.

07:07.320 --> 07:09.840
I wanna first just pause and say,

07:09.840 --> 07:11.360
there are some really important things

07:11.360 --> 07:12.800
that you point out here,

07:12.800 --> 07:16.560
which is that giving money is absolutely better

07:16.560 --> 07:18.760
as an act of trust and solidarity

07:18.760 --> 07:21.880
and love for one's fellow human beings than giving stuff,

07:21.880 --> 07:25.800
which is really a mode of kind of retaining control

07:25.800 --> 07:28.480
and retaining a sort of paternalistic view of other people.

07:28.480 --> 07:30.120
I think I know what you need.

07:30.120 --> 07:30.960
Here it is.

07:30.960 --> 07:31.800
Exactly.

07:31.800 --> 07:33.760
If I give you money, you're gonna go spend it on drugs

07:33.760 --> 07:34.600
or alcohol.

07:34.600 --> 07:35.440
Yes.

07:35.440 --> 07:37.960
So here's a nice tie that you can wear

07:37.960 --> 07:39.680
to your office job that I think you should get

07:39.680 --> 07:40.520
for whatever it is.

07:40.520 --> 07:41.360
Exactly.

07:41.360 --> 07:43.800
And actually the problem with effective altruism

07:43.800 --> 07:48.800
starts with a similar but maybe way expanded level

07:49.000 --> 07:50.480
of that kind of hubris.

07:50.480 --> 07:53.200
A sense of we, the smartest people

07:53.200 --> 07:56.360
with the best algorithms know best

07:56.360 --> 07:58.720
how money should be used.

07:58.720 --> 08:03.360
So it was never a philosophy of actual trust

08:03.360 --> 08:05.480
and engagement with other people.

08:05.480 --> 08:08.160
It was always a philosophy of,

08:08.200 --> 08:09.800
here's a philosophical term for you,

08:09.800 --> 08:12.280
epistemological hubris.

08:12.280 --> 08:16.480
A real sense of we can optimize

08:16.480 --> 08:21.480
and we can perfect the exact sort of quantifiable change

08:23.200 --> 08:25.240
that our philanthropy is going to produce

08:25.240 --> 08:28.880
and that makes us feel good in the same way

08:28.880 --> 08:31.720
that a lot of philanthropy is really designed

08:31.720 --> 08:36.720
to make the donor feel good, feel validated in themselves.

08:36.760 --> 08:37.840
You're kind of blowing my mind

08:37.840 --> 08:39.800
because the whole premise of effective altruism is,

08:39.800 --> 08:42.960
oh, so many donations are just feel good,

08:42.960 --> 08:45.080
but effective altruism is you point out

08:45.080 --> 08:46.080
feel good in a different way

08:46.080 --> 08:48.080
because you sort of have that.

08:48.080 --> 08:49.080
It's almost like when you buy something

08:49.080 --> 08:50.400
off the wire cutter recommendation,

08:50.400 --> 08:52.040
you're like, I got the best one.

08:52.040 --> 08:54.120
I feel so proud because I know I got the best one

08:54.120 --> 08:55.960
and you follow the Give Well recommendation.

08:55.960 --> 08:57.240
I followed all the evidence.

08:57.240 --> 08:59.400
This says that this is the best donation.

08:59.400 --> 09:00.880
I'm the best little boy.

09:00.880 --> 09:04.720
Well, a very, like a real extension

09:04.920 --> 09:08.400
of the sort of Puritan work ethic of like,

09:08.400 --> 09:13.400
oh, instead of I have just have the best character

09:13.520 --> 09:16.280
and now it's I was also the smartest, right?

09:16.280 --> 09:18.600
So you get to, in fact, you get to have both

09:18.600 --> 09:20.720
where you're like, not only am I such a good person,

09:20.720 --> 09:23.400
but I'm the smartest at being a good person.

09:23.400 --> 09:27.560
So there's a lot of ego wrapped up in that method

09:27.560 --> 09:32.040
that ultimately I think proved itself, proved it's undoing

09:32.080 --> 09:34.680
that says, okay, this was never really engaged

09:34.680 --> 09:37.920
with the complexities of systems,

09:37.920 --> 09:40.400
the complexities of what people on the ground

09:40.400 --> 09:41.600
might say they need

09:41.600 --> 09:44.200
or even the complexity of systems change.

09:44.200 --> 09:46.640
In fact, if you look at the effective altruists

09:48.920 --> 09:50.840
publications, they would say,

09:50.840 --> 09:53.280
we're not getting involved in political change.

09:53.280 --> 09:54.760
That takes too long.

09:54.760 --> 09:57.120
There's no way to measure the Delta.

09:57.120 --> 09:59.120
There's no way to be secure.

09:59.120 --> 10:01.360
Again, going back to that kind of need

10:01.360 --> 10:05.280
for validation, need for confirmation of efficacy.

10:05.280 --> 10:08.760
So being part of something that might be a longer,

10:08.760 --> 10:12.680
more complex, but ultimately more transformative

10:14.480 --> 10:17.600
initiative for what you use your dollars for

10:17.600 --> 10:19.360
was not attractive to them.

10:19.360 --> 10:22.040
Cause they want, you know, effective altruists want

10:22.040 --> 10:24.160
the immediate, the tangible, the concrete,

10:24.160 --> 10:27.040
the quantifiable for their own gratification,

10:27.040 --> 10:27.880
in my opinion.

10:27.880 --> 10:28.720
Yeah.

10:28.720 --> 10:30.840
Let's talk a little bit about the roots of this movement.

10:31.560 --> 10:34.560
So Peter Singer, again, utilitarian philosopher,

10:34.560 --> 10:36.560
sort of develops these philosophies about,

10:36.560 --> 10:40.160
if you want to do the most good and you should,

10:40.160 --> 10:42.720
that's sort of an ethical burden on you,

10:42.720 --> 10:45.720
then you should figure out the way to save the most lives,

10:45.720 --> 10:48.040
reduce the most suffering.

10:48.040 --> 10:50.440
And it's purely a philosophical position,

10:50.440 --> 10:52.560
but it gets picked up by what we call

10:52.560 --> 10:54.000
the effective altruism movement.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.240
Who are these people and where did they come from?

10:57.280 --> 11:02.280
Effective altruism has a lot of purchase among tech wealth

11:02.600 --> 11:03.640
on the West coast.

11:03.640 --> 11:08.520
So Dustin Moskovitz, who's one of the Facebook founders,

11:08.520 --> 11:10.360
he's a major, he and his wife, Kerry Tuna,

11:10.360 --> 11:12.920
major funders of Give Well.

11:12.920 --> 11:17.000
Now this goes to other household names, Elon Musk,

11:17.000 --> 11:21.040
has jumped on the effective altruist train.

11:21.040 --> 11:23.600
Peter Thiel has jumped on the effective altruism train

11:23.600 --> 11:24.440
as well.

11:24.440 --> 11:25.720
There's a lot of spread.

11:25.720 --> 11:28.960
I'll have creep, I would say, about this philosophy,

11:28.960 --> 11:31.440
but it fits in neatly with this idea

11:31.440 --> 11:34.400
that the world is reducible to calculation.

11:34.400 --> 11:38.800
The world is reducible to some kind of definitive,

11:38.800 --> 11:42.200
like algorithmic analysis.

11:42.200 --> 11:46.160
So the idea is that a problem like poverty

11:46.160 --> 11:49.760
can be solved by some kind of uniquely identifiable

11:49.760 --> 11:53.800
single kind of line item of what you're gonna give to people.

11:53.800 --> 11:54.920
It could be bed nets.

11:54.960 --> 11:56.800
It could be something else.

11:58.120 --> 12:03.120
But it is this idea that somehow there's one intervention

12:03.560 --> 12:06.520
that your money can do that somehow is gonna have

12:06.520 --> 12:09.360
an outsize effect on people's lives.

12:09.360 --> 12:11.760
There's a satisfaction in that, right?

12:11.760 --> 12:13.960
I remember donating the Against Malaria Foundation,

12:13.960 --> 12:16.680
which I have no reason to believe is a bad organization.

12:17.680 --> 12:21.120
And you make your donation and they show you

12:21.120 --> 12:24.360
a little progress update for like the dollars,

12:24.360 --> 12:27.400
how many bed nets your dollars are buying

12:27.400 --> 12:29.000
and where they're going

12:29.000 --> 12:31.440
and how many people they're gonna protect.

12:31.440 --> 12:34.880
And it feels so quantifiable and positive.

12:34.880 --> 12:37.200
Malaria is a huge problem and it kills many people.

12:37.200 --> 12:40.520
And I'll take it on faith

12:40.520 --> 12:42.640
that the lack of bed nets is a problem.

12:42.640 --> 12:44.480
And it's something that I can,

12:44.480 --> 12:45.720
if I buy two more bed nets,

12:45.720 --> 12:46.640
then those are two more people

12:46.640 --> 12:48.720
who are gonna have access to them.

12:48.720 --> 12:53.440
But it is my feeling that it's still my emotion

12:53.800 --> 12:55.200
that is being triggered there.

12:55.200 --> 12:56.040
Right.

12:56.040 --> 12:59.360
Well, the Nobel Prize winning economist, Angus Deaton,

12:59.360 --> 13:02.320
referred to the effective altruist movement as the idea

13:02.320 --> 13:03.160
that lies-

13:03.160 --> 13:04.000
Past guest Angus Deaton, by the way.

13:04.000 --> 13:04.840
Past guest.

13:04.840 --> 13:05.680
Thank you.

13:05.680 --> 13:06.520
Thank you.

13:06.520 --> 13:07.360
Great.

13:07.360 --> 13:08.200
A colleague then.

13:08.200 --> 13:10.200
Just so you know, Nobel Prize on the show before.

13:10.200 --> 13:12.040
And that means one for you in the future.

13:12.040 --> 13:12.880
Thank you.

13:12.880 --> 13:13.720
I appreciate that.

13:14.680 --> 13:17.120
So he referred to effective altruism as the idea

13:17.120 --> 13:20.840
that lives can be bought cheaply, like used cars.

13:20.840 --> 13:22.560
It's the idea that lives are bought,

13:22.560 --> 13:24.640
you're looking for the best deal.

13:24.640 --> 13:28.480
You're looking for lives that you can gain cost-effectively.

13:28.480 --> 13:29.320
Yeah.

13:29.320 --> 13:31.840
That feels like a kind of icky, reductive way

13:31.840 --> 13:33.520
of looking at other human beings.

13:33.520 --> 13:35.800
Yeah, it's like you're doing your charity like storage wars.

13:35.800 --> 13:36.960
Like you're showing up going like,

13:36.960 --> 13:39.040
how much can I get for,

13:39.040 --> 13:42.040
oh, those lives are going for like 10 bucks each.

13:42.040 --> 13:43.960
I can save a bunch of lives over there.

13:43.960 --> 13:45.120
Yes.

13:45.120 --> 13:48.560
And that in fact is used as an argument for,

13:48.560 --> 13:51.240
hey, why would you spend your charity dollar in the US?

13:51.240 --> 13:52.720
It'll go much further if you spend it overseas,

13:52.720 --> 13:53.560
you'll save more lives.

13:53.560 --> 13:54.400
Exactly.

13:54.400 --> 13:55.640
Which is like, on the one hand,

13:55.640 --> 13:56.960
the first time you hear that, you're like,

13:56.960 --> 13:59.080
okay, yeah, maybe I am being, you know,

13:59.080 --> 14:03.640
chauvinistic by saying, oh, people in my city are better,

14:03.640 --> 14:06.560
a more important, maybe I should, all lives are equal, right?

14:06.560 --> 14:07.400
Yeah.

14:07.400 --> 14:09.280
But then on the other hand, after a while you start going,

14:09.280 --> 14:12.000
well, why wouldn't I try to improve the place I live?

14:12.000 --> 14:12.840
Right.

14:12.840 --> 14:13.680
That's where I live.

14:13.680 --> 14:14.520
Right.

14:14.520 --> 14:15.840
It's where I live and it's where I'm actually

14:15.840 --> 14:17.600
in relationship with other people.

14:17.600 --> 14:18.440
Exactly.

14:18.440 --> 14:19.640
In some really important way.

14:19.640 --> 14:22.200
So you have a bigger chance, a better shot

14:22.200 --> 14:25.920
at seeing people as full, complex human beings

14:25.920 --> 14:28.400
rather than just these kind of abstract objects

14:28.400 --> 14:31.960
that I refer to them in the book as like avatars of poverty.

14:31.960 --> 14:34.360
There's this like flattening and objectification

14:34.360 --> 14:37.080
of people that comes with giving philosophies

14:37.080 --> 14:40.880
that really see people as only their vulnerability,

14:40.880 --> 14:43.240
only their need, only their desperation,

14:43.240 --> 14:46.320
that you then the hero donor can save

14:46.320 --> 14:49.520
for just one dollar a day with just one bed net.

14:49.520 --> 14:53.160
There's a real, you want to talk about chauvinism,

14:53.160 --> 14:55.200
but there's a real egotistical feedback loop

14:55.200 --> 15:00.200
that comes with that that has a less chance of evolution

15:00.920 --> 15:04.600
than if you say, okay, I'm really focusing giving

15:04.600 --> 15:07.720
in a way that keeps me in deep connected relationship

15:07.720 --> 15:10.040
with other people and build some common world

15:10.040 --> 15:11.240
that I want to share with them.

15:11.240 --> 15:13.320
And that's what the people sort of running

15:13.320 --> 15:14.600
this movement kind of lacked.

15:14.600 --> 15:19.120
They weren't actually in community with anybody

15:19.120 --> 15:20.920
other than themselves and the wealthy people

15:20.920 --> 15:21.840
that they hung out with.

15:21.840 --> 15:24.040
And that really led to some biases.

15:24.040 --> 15:28.040
Like I used to read the givewell.org recommendations

15:28.040 --> 15:30.960
every year and see how they would rank different things.

15:30.960 --> 15:32.920
And then one year I went, well, hold on a second,

15:32.920 --> 15:34.240
I'm really concerned about climate change.

15:34.240 --> 15:35.600
Have they done any work on climate change?

15:35.600 --> 15:39.000
And I dug into their, like they publish all their papers.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.580
It's very academic and rigorous.

15:40.580 --> 15:42.080
And I went and looked at the climate change

15:42.080 --> 15:43.960
and they had done, you know, a couple of pages on them.

15:43.960 --> 15:45.360
They were like, well, we evaluated some things,

15:45.360 --> 15:47.240
but we couldn't really find proof.

15:47.240 --> 15:49.100
You know, they want really rigorous evidence

15:49.100 --> 15:51.940
that your dollar is going to, you know,

15:51.940 --> 15:53.020
create such and such good.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.340
And they're like, we couldn't really find a charity

15:54.340 --> 15:55.460
that would prove that.

15:55.460 --> 15:56.300
Right.

15:56.300 --> 15:58.460
And I'm going, well, what do you have to?

15:58.460 --> 16:00.940
Like, you know, can't, we have,

16:00.940 --> 16:02.700
like that standard is really high.

16:02.700 --> 16:04.700
And then I started looking at the other things

16:04.700 --> 16:07.300
they were recommending and they had started to go,

16:07.300 --> 16:10.660
oh, a new area of focus for us is AI mitigation.

16:10.660 --> 16:11.900
We're really worried.

16:11.900 --> 16:14.700
And by the way, this was like five to seven years ago.

16:14.700 --> 16:15.700
They were like, we're really worried

16:15.700 --> 16:17.660
that AI is going to take over the world.

16:17.660 --> 16:19.580
And if we invest money right now,

16:19.580 --> 16:21.540
preventing AI from taking over the world,

16:21.540 --> 16:23.380
that's going to be the most valuable.

16:23.380 --> 16:26.860
And I was like, who, you're not working on climate change,

16:26.860 --> 16:29.780
but you are working on AI?

16:29.780 --> 16:31.820
Like, what, why?

16:31.820 --> 16:32.660
And-

16:32.660 --> 16:34.780
Well, there's two things happening there.

16:34.780 --> 16:38.940
And one is that climate change is really ill-suited

16:38.940 --> 16:40.020
to their framework.

16:40.020 --> 16:43.020
It's complex, it's multivalent.

16:43.020 --> 16:45.460
It's going to require lots of different kinds

16:45.460 --> 16:47.580
of interventions, going to require social movements.

16:47.580 --> 16:49.980
Stuff that you can't easily quantify

16:49.980 --> 16:52.540
and it's going to happen at a much slower pace

16:52.540 --> 16:55.820
than the kind of immediacy of like bed net equals life.

16:55.820 --> 16:57.180
You know?

16:57.180 --> 16:59.460
The other thing that's going on there

16:59.460 --> 17:04.460
is that the appeal of the long-term future

17:04.460 --> 17:08.140
because long-termism is the sort of new fad

17:08.140 --> 17:08.980
that you're referring to.

17:08.980 --> 17:10.700
That became their new thing of, oh, we need to think

17:10.700 --> 17:12.980
not just five years or 10 years into the future,

17:12.980 --> 17:14.500
but like 10,000 years.

17:14.500 --> 17:15.340
Right.

17:15.820 --> 17:18.980
This is sort of the end state of thinking of humanity

17:18.980 --> 17:20.940
only in terms of volume.

17:20.940 --> 17:25.180
Like how the number of beings that we count as human beings

17:25.180 --> 17:28.100
who could maximally be alive

17:28.100 --> 17:30.340
and not about quality of life,

17:30.340 --> 17:32.740
not about quality of our world,

17:32.740 --> 17:34.460
but really just the numbers.

17:35.740 --> 17:39.260
I refer in the book to their philosophy

17:39.260 --> 17:42.660
of existing human beings as depreciating assets.

17:42.660 --> 17:43.500
Right?

17:43.500 --> 17:45.980
If you're a human being that's alive today,

17:45.980 --> 17:47.300
you have liabilities.

17:47.300 --> 17:50.980
You can't, you know, immediately you can't quite maximize,

17:50.980 --> 17:52.260
we're not ideal figures.

17:52.260 --> 17:53.860
You can't maximize our utility.

17:53.860 --> 17:55.300
You can't maximize our labor.

17:55.300 --> 17:56.740
We might have sickness.

17:56.740 --> 17:57.620
We're going to age.

17:57.620 --> 17:59.660
Like it's like you drive a car off the lot

17:59.660 --> 18:02.620
to extend Angus Deaton's analogy.

18:02.620 --> 18:06.300
Like the moment a human being is alive, it has liabilities.

18:06.300 --> 18:10.020
And so if they're looking for this perfect, optimized,

18:10.060 --> 18:13.780
idealized human civilization

18:13.780 --> 18:17.220
that really is about maximizing the number of human beings

18:17.220 --> 18:19.900
that are alive and productive at any given time,

18:19.900 --> 18:21.940
then you're going to look way into the future

18:21.940 --> 18:23.740
when it's just a computer model.

18:23.740 --> 18:26.180
You're not going to deal with the reality of human beings

18:26.180 --> 18:28.860
in the here and now because it's too complex

18:28.860 --> 18:30.860
and it's too compromised in a way.

18:30.860 --> 18:33.700
There's also a degree to which it's taking

18:33.700 --> 18:35.580
like a philosophical thought experiment

18:35.580 --> 18:36.740
and taking it literally.

18:36.740 --> 18:39.180
Like it's all well and good to write, you know,

18:39.180 --> 18:41.220
well, hey, if I could, you know,

18:41.220 --> 18:45.340
if you could spend $1,000 and save one life today

18:45.340 --> 18:47.060
or you could spend $1,000

18:47.060 --> 18:49.820
and save 10,000 lives in the future

18:49.820 --> 18:53.620
because you are preventing AI mitigation

18:53.620 --> 18:55.100
or you're mitigating an AI

18:55.100 --> 18:57.140
that could potentially kill billions of people

18:57.140 --> 18:58.900
in the future and you're blah, blah, blah, blah.

18:58.900 --> 18:59.740
Right.

18:59.740 --> 19:00.740
In a philosophical thought experiment,

19:00.740 --> 19:04.140
you could have a fun time deciding which is more important.

19:04.140 --> 19:08.340
But like as if someone who studied philosophy,

19:08.340 --> 19:10.780
I was always like, well, you don't actually do that shit.

19:10.780 --> 19:11.780
You know what I mean?

19:11.780 --> 19:13.100
It's a thought experiment.

19:13.100 --> 19:15.060
Like the Chinese room isn't real.

19:15.060 --> 19:17.860
The lever that makes the train go from one, you know.

19:17.860 --> 19:19.140
I hope I can say on this show

19:19.140 --> 19:21.420
that there's something masturbatory about all of it,

19:21.420 --> 19:22.820
you know, there is something like.

19:22.820 --> 19:24.860
Well, philosophy is inherently masturbatory.

19:24.860 --> 19:25.900
I couldn't agree more.

19:25.900 --> 19:27.100
And that's the great thing about it.

19:27.100 --> 19:28.060
I love masturbating.

19:28.060 --> 19:29.460
Well, it's been great being on the show.

19:29.460 --> 19:30.300
I'm glad.

19:30.300 --> 19:33.460
But I don't, but you know,

19:33.460 --> 19:35.660
masturbating is that's only one part of my life.

19:35.660 --> 19:37.820
I don't take that to the rest of my social life.

19:37.820 --> 19:39.620
I don't have to talk about pie charts, Adam.

19:39.620 --> 19:41.100
We don't have to look at the breakdown.

19:41.100 --> 19:42.020
It's okay.

19:42.020 --> 19:44.340
Let's move off of this metaphor.

19:44.340 --> 19:47.740
But yeah, there's an oddness to taking it.

19:47.740 --> 19:49.740
Even taking utilitarianism, which again,

19:49.740 --> 19:51.940
I think is a philosophy with a lot to recommend it.

19:51.940 --> 19:53.860
I'm not like some Peter Singer hater,

19:53.860 --> 19:55.380
but it is the kind of thing

19:55.380 --> 19:57.740
where when you actually take it really seriously,

19:57.740 --> 19:59.580
you're like, well.

19:59.580 --> 20:03.180
The big problem with effective altruism is its absolutism.

20:03.180 --> 20:05.660
The fact that there's really very little room

20:05.660 --> 20:09.540
for alternative ways of thinking.

20:09.540 --> 20:13.420
And to me, that's symptomatic of a bigger problem,

20:13.420 --> 20:16.860
which is that under our current kind of,

20:16.860 --> 20:18.780
yeah, can I use the term neoliberal here?

20:18.780 --> 20:20.060
Can we talk about neoliberalism?

20:20.060 --> 20:20.900
Fantastic.

20:20.900 --> 20:24.300
So under neoliberalism, which is the kind of philosophy

20:24.300 --> 20:27.540
that we really need to be competitive in the market

20:27.540 --> 20:29.860
as much as possible, that our whole lives need to be

20:29.860 --> 20:33.340
kind of oriented towards our performance

20:33.340 --> 20:35.020
in the economic market.

20:35.020 --> 20:36.900
It means that that takes over our lives

20:36.900 --> 20:39.100
to the exclusion of all other ways

20:39.100 --> 20:41.660
of relating to ourselves and to other people.

20:41.660 --> 20:45.020
And effective altruism is this kind of consummate example

20:45.020 --> 20:47.700
of that taking over philanthropy of saying,

20:47.700 --> 20:50.340
well, human beings are really just,

20:51.780 --> 20:54.500
the metric that we use to judge worth

20:54.500 --> 20:57.380
is whether we're alive and economically productive.

20:57.380 --> 20:59.620
And that's the mode by which we decide

20:59.620 --> 21:01.660
where our charitable dollars go.

21:01.660 --> 21:04.500
And that excludes so many other dimensions

21:04.500 --> 21:08.540
of human life and things that make life worth living

21:08.540 --> 21:11.020
and actually make us human.

21:11.020 --> 21:14.420
Well, how did effective altruism get involved

21:14.420 --> 21:16.940
with crypto and with Sam Bankman Freed?

21:16.940 --> 21:19.940
Because this is the oddest part of the story, I think.

21:19.940 --> 21:20.780
Right.

21:20.780 --> 21:23.620
Well, I'm not a journalist with expertise

21:23.620 --> 21:25.380
on the kind of chronology of that,

21:25.380 --> 21:30.380
but I can say that early effective altruism

21:30.380 --> 21:35.380
was popular among a kind of class of young bankers

21:35.940 --> 21:40.300
who signed onto this idea of earning to give, right?

21:40.300 --> 21:42.580
This was part of the philosophy was like,

21:42.580 --> 21:45.220
oh, instead of going to work for a nonprofit

21:45.220 --> 21:47.260
where there's gonna be limits,

21:47.260 --> 21:51.700
constraints on how much good I can personally contribute,

21:51.700 --> 21:54.780
the idea is, oh, if I go make a ton of money

21:54.780 --> 21:57.020
working in banking, working in a hedge fund

21:57.020 --> 21:59.780
and I give it away to the most effective charities,

21:59.820 --> 22:02.780
then I'll be doing so much more good.

22:02.780 --> 22:04.420
I don't wanna pause and just say,

22:04.420 --> 22:07.940
notice how much the I figures in to all of this.

22:07.940 --> 22:11.180
Notice how much this is about the sovereign self,

22:11.180 --> 22:14.700
the sovereign control, I as the sort of actor in history.

22:14.700 --> 22:18.020
And there's a missing parentheses in that little story,

22:18.020 --> 22:21.580
which is also in the second version, I'll be fucking rich.

22:21.580 --> 22:22.420
Of course.

22:22.420 --> 22:23.260
Right.

22:23.260 --> 22:25.900
I'll have a private jet and a penthouse.

22:25.900 --> 22:28.940
Or, and like, at any time,

22:28.940 --> 22:31.940
I can just keep more of the money if it works for me.

22:31.940 --> 22:34.060
Like even if you start off saying,

22:34.060 --> 22:36.420
okay, I'm gonna live a monkish existence

22:36.420 --> 22:38.940
and donate my seven figure bonuses

22:38.940 --> 22:41.300
to effective altruist ranked charities, that's fine.

22:41.300 --> 22:43.860
But at any given time, you can still choose to pull back

22:43.860 --> 22:44.700
and say, you know what,

22:44.700 --> 22:46.460
I actually would like some of this money for myself.

22:46.460 --> 22:49.660
I feel like I've accumulated enough virtue points

22:49.660 --> 22:50.500
in the world.

22:50.500 --> 22:51.340
Yeah.

22:51.340 --> 22:54.740
Versus actually working in service of other people.

22:54.740 --> 22:55.580
Right.

22:55.580 --> 22:59.100
And since take a $70,000 a year a job as a social worker,

22:59.100 --> 23:01.060
which would be a great salary for a social worker,

23:01.060 --> 23:03.940
and actually work in service of others,

23:03.940 --> 23:06.620
now your needs are less prioritized.

23:06.620 --> 23:07.940
Your needs are less prioritized

23:07.940 --> 23:10.340
and you just don't have as much control.

23:10.340 --> 23:11.180
You don't have as much,

23:11.180 --> 23:13.180
you're working in with other people as well

23:13.180 --> 23:14.260
and within the system.

23:14.260 --> 23:18.980
So there's this undercurrent of maximizing the amount

23:18.980 --> 23:22.260
of control that you, the donor have,

23:22.300 --> 23:26.060
even if you are allegedly doing it all for humanity.

23:26.060 --> 23:27.980
So there's this whole cohort of bankers

23:27.980 --> 23:29.500
who are signing on this philosophy.

23:29.500 --> 23:30.340
Right.

23:30.340 --> 23:33.860
There's a story in the book about a guy named Matt Wage,

23:33.860 --> 23:35.340
who was a student of Peter Singers

23:35.340 --> 23:39.100
and this is a early description of this philosophy.

23:39.100 --> 23:43.500
He says, imagine if you walk past a burning building

23:43.500 --> 23:48.500
and you could save all 100 people who were inside.

23:48.940 --> 23:51.420
Like you had a way of like putting out the fire

23:51.460 --> 23:53.860
or you could kick down the door and save 100 people,

23:53.860 --> 23:57.180
that would be the greatest day of your life.

23:57.180 --> 24:01.660
And you're like the greatest day of your life.

24:01.660 --> 24:03.980
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

24:03.980 --> 24:06.300
Everybody else inside had a pretty shini day.

24:06.300 --> 24:07.140
Right.

24:07.140 --> 24:08.780
Also especially cause there was one guy

24:08.780 --> 24:09.860
trying to save all of them

24:09.860 --> 24:12.420
instead of an entire firefighting system.

24:12.420 --> 24:13.660
And also they're building burned down

24:13.660 --> 24:18.660
because of poor safety codes and maybe the building inspector

24:18.660 --> 24:21.540
You know, the building inspector had been, you know,

24:21.540 --> 24:22.900
defunded the previous year

24:22.900 --> 24:25.940
because there had been some tax cuts across the city.

24:25.940 --> 24:28.220
So that the, you know, so the hero guy walking around.

24:28.220 --> 24:29.780
A city that now is like,

24:29.780 --> 24:32.300
you, the hedge fund you work for holds a bond

24:32.300 --> 24:35.100
against that debt, by the way, right?

24:35.100 --> 24:36.420
So, yes.

24:36.420 --> 24:37.580
Those people didn't have great days,

24:37.580 --> 24:39.780
but the hero who rescued everybody.

24:39.780 --> 24:41.500
You at the best day, right?

24:41.500 --> 24:46.500
So, I think you can draw a line from that mentality

24:47.500 --> 24:51.060
to a Sam Bankman freed who says,

24:51.060 --> 24:54.420
aha, like here is a movement Taylor made for me,

24:54.420 --> 24:58.900
a guy who thinks he is the smartest and the most effective

24:58.900 --> 25:02.180
and really doesn't have to answer to anybody else

25:02.180 --> 25:03.220
as we found out.

25:03.220 --> 25:05.580
He really didn't think he did.

25:05.580 --> 25:10.580
So there was a, there's a sort of through line of justification

25:10.740 --> 25:14.420
of accumulating wealth by any means

25:14.420 --> 25:16.820
because you're going to put it to, as you put it,

25:16.820 --> 25:18.540
the right ends.

25:18.540 --> 25:21.060
So that's how we end up with a Sam Bankman freed.

25:21.060 --> 25:24.060
And he became completely entwined

25:24.060 --> 25:25.900
in the effective altruism movement.

25:25.900 --> 25:28.060
My understanding is a huge amount,

25:28.060 --> 25:31.020
money started flooding into this movement.

25:31.020 --> 25:34.060
The New Yorker did a wonderful piece on this.

25:34.060 --> 25:36.340
You know, they started buying buildings or whatever

25:36.340 --> 25:37.900
and like, you know, having all this space

25:37.900 --> 25:39.660
and you know, yada, yada, yada.

25:39.660 --> 25:42.140
And a lot of that money was coming from Sam Bankman freed

25:42.140 --> 25:44.100
and other crypto people.

25:44.100 --> 25:47.340
And now that he is about, as we speak right now,

25:47.340 --> 25:49.260
about to go to prison for a very long time

25:49.260 --> 25:52.060
because he was convicted of one of the most massive

25:52.060 --> 25:54.460
financial frauds in American history,

25:54.460 --> 25:57.860
it's discredited the movement because the,

25:57.860 --> 25:59.980
like the leading lights of this movement,

25:59.980 --> 26:03.500
the philosopher kings who were writing the papers

26:03.500 --> 26:08.020
and spreading the good word were like best buddies with him,

26:08.020 --> 26:11.300
one of the most unethical people in the history of the country.

26:11.300 --> 26:13.140
Why? Because he had the money.

26:13.740 --> 26:17.740
The entire board of the FTX Foundation resigned

26:17.740 --> 26:22.740
and wrote an open letter once the indictments came for Sam.

26:23.140 --> 26:26.220
And there were a number of responses that basically said,

26:26.220 --> 26:28.900
how could you like, you guys have PhDs from Oxford,

26:28.900 --> 26:30.820
like how could you have worked with this guy

26:30.820 --> 26:33.540
and had a foundation that was allegedly

26:33.540 --> 26:36.940
going to give out a hundred million dollars a year, right?

26:36.940 --> 26:41.060
And you know, buy into all of this hype

26:42.060 --> 26:45.460
without really checking the reality.

26:45.460 --> 26:47.900
Yeah, they were going to give out a hundred million dollars

26:47.900 --> 26:52.500
a year to save lives and the future of humanity, yada, yada.

26:52.500 --> 26:55.580
But that was money that they got because they just stole it.

26:55.580 --> 27:00.100
They stole it from other people who were told, like, disappear.

27:00.100 --> 27:02.500
But you misunderstand, those people were dumber.

27:05.100 --> 27:06.220
They were just dumber.

27:06.220 --> 27:08.860
They were dumb enough to believe what we told them,

27:08.980 --> 27:11.460
which is that FTX and all that was a great investment.

27:11.460 --> 27:12.740
Exactly.

27:12.740 --> 27:14.940
So clearly they would not have been better.

27:14.940 --> 27:17.740
They were not worthy stewards of this money.

27:17.740 --> 27:21.540
The way we, the people stealing it from them, would have been.

27:21.540 --> 27:23.780
One of the things I find most fascinating about this

27:23.780 --> 27:26.980
is that it's a really rare example

27:26.980 --> 27:30.460
of a philosophical idea or a philosophical movement

27:30.460 --> 27:32.660
starting with Peter Singer and the utilitarians

27:32.660 --> 27:35.020
that is now discredited.

27:35.020 --> 27:37.380
I have to think that there's been some backlash

27:37.380 --> 27:40.060
in the Philosophical Academy about this

27:40.060 --> 27:42.900
because of its association with the real world.

27:42.900 --> 27:46.580
It's rare for a philosophical idea

27:46.580 --> 27:48.940
to interact with the real world so badly

27:48.940 --> 27:50.140
that it becomes discredited.

27:50.140 --> 27:51.820
That seems to have happened here, at least to me.

27:51.820 --> 27:54.380
It has, and it's happened quickly, right?

27:54.380 --> 27:56.340
It's happened in this very compressed timeframe

27:56.340 --> 27:59.300
where you have this rise of trend of effective altruism,

27:59.300 --> 28:01.340
like you say New Yorker profiles,

28:01.340 --> 28:04.340
major public figures coming into view.

28:05.100 --> 28:07.460
Not typical to have a giving philosophy

28:07.460 --> 28:10.420
becoming such a zeitgeisty thing.

28:11.420 --> 28:13.980
And then you have this scandal that happened

28:13.980 --> 28:16.420
so quickly and so dramatically.

28:16.420 --> 28:19.060
And I think what it proved is the flaws

28:19.060 --> 28:21.380
that were baked into the philosophical model

28:21.380 --> 28:23.180
immediately proved true,

28:23.180 --> 28:25.540
like the moment it started to interact with,

28:25.540 --> 28:29.580
I don't think in a way it's surprising that this happened

28:29.580 --> 28:33.460
because this is just the inevitable product

28:33.460 --> 28:35.700
of a philosophy that says we can do the most good

28:35.700 --> 28:37.580
in the world without actually really caring

28:37.580 --> 28:40.460
about other people and our obligations to them.

28:40.460 --> 28:41.420
Yeah, it's really interesting.

28:41.420 --> 28:44.020
Cause again, utilitarianism is not something

28:44.020 --> 28:47.260
I throw out by itself, but the knock against it

28:47.260 --> 28:49.820
is always that it leads to sort of perverse outcomes

28:49.820 --> 28:51.540
if you actually follow through on it.

28:51.540 --> 28:54.220
And holy shit, it happened immediately.

28:54.220 --> 28:55.540
Right.

28:55.540 --> 28:57.900
Who could have predicted everyone?

28:57.900 --> 28:59.660
It do be like that.

28:59.660 --> 29:01.620
It do be like that.

29:02.340 --> 29:04.060
Honestly, I'd love to have Peter Singer on this show

29:04.060 --> 29:05.860
because I still think he's a fascinating thinker.

29:05.860 --> 29:06.780
Absolutely.

29:06.780 --> 29:08.780
And I'd love to hear how he interacts

29:08.780 --> 29:10.340
with some of what happened since,

29:10.340 --> 29:11.940
but you know what, let's take a really quick break

29:11.940 --> 29:14.140
cause I want to talk to you when we get back

29:14.140 --> 29:17.580
about other streams of philanthropic thought

29:17.580 --> 29:18.580
and mistakes that have been made

29:18.580 --> 29:22.340
and how we can actually maybe help each other

29:22.340 --> 29:23.540
in a more productive way.

29:23.540 --> 29:25.900
But we'll be right back with more Amy Shiller.

29:25.900 --> 29:27.420
You know, the year is never more hectic

29:27.420 --> 29:28.700
than during the holiday season

29:28.700 --> 29:30.980
with travel plans, work projects wrapping up.

29:30.980 --> 29:32.020
And if you're on a household,

29:32.020 --> 29:34.140
it's sometimes even hard to remember what's for dinner

29:34.140 --> 29:36.300
or if anyone is remembered to feed the dog.

29:36.300 --> 29:37.540
If this sounds like your home

29:37.540 --> 29:38.900
or the home of someone you know,

29:38.900 --> 29:41.700
this holiday season is time for the gift of organization

29:41.700 --> 29:43.300
with the skylight calendar.

29:43.300 --> 29:45.780
The skylight calendar is a smart touchscreen calendar

29:45.780 --> 29:48.700
and organizer for all your chores, groceries and to-dos.

29:48.700 --> 29:51.220
It automatically syncs all the different digital calendars

29:51.220 --> 29:52.500
and events your family uses

29:52.500 --> 29:53.860
and shows them all together

29:53.860 --> 29:56.300
on one beautiful touchscreen display.

29:56.300 --> 29:57.940
Skylight calendar is the best way

29:57.940 --> 29:59.540
to give your family peace of mind

29:59.540 --> 30:01.660
to enjoy the things that matter most.

30:01.660 --> 30:03.100
It works by syncing events

30:03.100 --> 30:05.180
from already existing calendars you have,

30:05.180 --> 30:07.500
including Google, Outlook and Apple calendars.

30:07.500 --> 30:10.340
You can also add events directly using the touchscreen

30:10.340 --> 30:12.500
or with the free skylight mobile app.

30:12.500 --> 30:15.380
It shows all family events together in one spot

30:15.380 --> 30:18.540
so you can see what everyone has going on each week.

30:18.540 --> 30:20.460
Families are more likely to actually check it

30:20.460 --> 30:21.580
since it's always up to date

30:21.580 --> 30:23.860
so they don't question mom every day about schedules.

30:23.860 --> 30:25.940
And it also comes in two sizes,

30:25.940 --> 30:28.300
small 10 inch or large 15 inch.

30:28.300 --> 30:30.060
The large one is wall-mountable

30:30.060 --> 30:32.180
and looks beautiful up on the wall.

30:32.180 --> 30:33.140
And on top of that,

30:33.140 --> 30:35.460
there are multiple view options to choose from,

30:35.460 --> 30:37.020
day, week or month views,

30:37.020 --> 30:38.820
or you can set it to schedule view

30:38.820 --> 30:40.180
to see a few days at a time

30:40.180 --> 30:42.660
formatted in hour by hour blocks.

30:42.660 --> 30:45.940
And as a special limited time offer for our listeners,

30:45.940 --> 30:48.980
you can get $15 off your purchase of a skylight calendar

30:48.980 --> 30:52.460

To get $15 off your purchase of a skylight calendar,

30:55.540 --> 30:58.940

30:58.940 --> 31:03.940
That's S-K-Y-L-I-G-H-T-C-A-L.com slash factually.

31:06.220 --> 31:07.980
You know, if you've listened to my podcast at all,

31:07.980 --> 31:09.940
you know that internet security and privacy

31:09.940 --> 31:11.420
are top concerns of mine.

31:11.420 --> 31:13.460
I don't think you can ever be too safe.

31:13.460 --> 31:16.060
And that's why I've used a virtual private network

31:16.060 --> 31:17.900
for years when I'm browsing the web.

31:17.900 --> 31:19.580
Some of you may use a VPN already,

31:19.580 --> 31:21.380
others of you might have heard of VPNs

31:21.380 --> 31:22.940
but not known where to start.

31:22.940 --> 31:25.100
Well, the time is now to make a jump

31:25.140 --> 31:28.020
to NordVPN as they're offering an exclusive deal

31:28.020 --> 31:29.660
to factually listeners.

31:29.660 --> 31:31.780
NordVPN shields your IP address

31:31.780 --> 31:33.380
and secures your online traffic

31:33.380 --> 31:35.420
with state of the art encryption.

31:35.420 --> 31:37.780
You can rest assured that you're listening to your podcasts,

31:37.780 --> 31:39.820
streaming shows and browsing the internet

31:39.820 --> 31:41.660
in complete privacy.

31:41.660 --> 31:43.220
No one looking over your shoulder

31:43.220 --> 31:45.620
and no one secretly tracking your data.

31:45.620 --> 31:47.100
My personal favorite feature

31:47.100 --> 31:49.860
is the ability to change your virtual location.

31:49.860 --> 31:52.060
If you're traveling abroad and wanna stream shows

31:52.060 --> 31:53.580
that are only available in the US,

31:53.580 --> 31:55.020
well, wherever you might be,

31:55.020 --> 31:56.660
just choose the little flag icon

31:56.660 --> 31:58.740
for US, Canada, UK, Germany,

31:58.740 --> 31:59.820
or dozens of others

31:59.820 --> 32:02.100
to change where your connection is coming from.

32:02.100 --> 32:04.260
I also really like that there's a built-in ad

32:04.260 --> 32:05.620
and malware blocker.

32:05.620 --> 32:07.340
They won't even make it to your browser,

32:07.340 --> 32:08.700
stop dead in their tracks

32:08.700 --> 32:11.060
before you even load those bad boys.

32:11.060 --> 32:12.940
NordVPN is simple to set up,

32:12.940 --> 32:14.140
even simpler to use

32:14.140 --> 32:16.740
and this is simply the best time to try it out.

32:16.740 --> 32:18.780

32:36.420 --> 32:38.300
love it or leave it for the holidays.

32:38.300 --> 32:40.820

33:14.220 --> 33:15.980
without triggering your gag reflex.

33:15.980 --> 33:18.020
It is pumpkin pie season after all.

33:18.020 --> 33:19.460
New episodes of love it or leave it

33:19.460 --> 33:20.980
drop every Saturday morning.

33:20.980 --> 33:22.220
You can watch full episodes

33:22.220 --> 33:23.820
on the love it or leave it YouTube channel

33:23.820 --> 33:26.620
or listen in wherever you get your podcasts.

33:26.620 --> 33:29.300
Do you know how much of your personal data

33:29.300 --> 33:30.900
is out there on the internet?

33:30.900 --> 33:31.820
There's a good chance

33:31.820 --> 33:34.140
it's a lot more than you'd be comfortable with.

33:34.140 --> 33:36.740
Every day, personal data is being sold

33:36.740 --> 33:39.300
and traded online by data brokers.

33:39.300 --> 33:41.540
But that doesn't mean you can't stay private

33:41.540 --> 33:43.540
and protect that personal data.

33:43.540 --> 33:46.100
And delete me is an indispensable tool

33:46.100 --> 33:47.620
for this very purpose.

33:47.620 --> 33:49.300
Delete me's teams of experts

33:49.300 --> 33:51.140
will scan the internet to find

33:51.140 --> 33:52.660
and delete your personal data

33:52.660 --> 33:54.180
and you will get a detailed report

33:54.180 --> 33:56.620
of their findings in just seven days.

33:56.620 --> 33:59.540
We live in an era of doxing online harassment

33:59.540 --> 34:02.700
and ID theft that can compromise not just your finances

34:02.700 --> 34:05.260
but potentially even ruin job opportunities.

34:05.260 --> 34:07.940
About 41% of Americans are exposed

34:07.940 --> 34:09.740
to some form of online harassment.

34:09.740 --> 34:11.060
And let me tell you something

34:11.060 --> 34:12.940
as a public figure on the internet,

34:12.940 --> 34:14.700
that's something that I deal with myself.

34:14.700 --> 34:17.460
And that is why I have been a subscriber

34:17.460 --> 34:18.980
to Delete Me for years.

34:18.980 --> 34:21.500
Years before they even sponsored this podcast,

34:21.500 --> 34:23.220
I just used their service.

34:23.220 --> 34:25.820
In fact, I signed up my entire family for it

34:25.820 --> 34:28.420
because I didn't want any of our names, addresses,

34:28.420 --> 34:31.380
phone numbers, any of that personal information online

34:31.380 --> 34:33.820
where people can just get it whenever they want.

34:33.820 --> 34:36.540
I wanted to keep myself safe and all of us safe.

34:36.540 --> 34:37.660
And let me tell you something,

34:37.660 --> 34:40.540
Delete Me has done a fantastic job of that for me.

34:40.540 --> 34:42.740
So if you wanna safeguard yourself

34:42.740 --> 34:44.180
and live with a peace of mind

34:44.180 --> 34:45.620
that experts are hunting down

34:45.620 --> 34:47.420
and removing your personal information

34:47.420 --> 34:48.980
from the internet every three months,

34:48.980 --> 34:50.660
then check out Delete Me.

34:50.660 --> 34:53.340
Go to joindeleteme.com slash Adam

34:59.820 --> 35:02.540
and get 20% off with the code Adam.

35:02.540 --> 35:03.900
Okay, we are back with Amy Schiller

35:03.900 --> 35:07.380
talking about philanthropy and all of its problems.

35:07.380 --> 35:08.500
And solutions.

35:08.500 --> 35:10.340
And solutions, we're gonna talk about solutions too,

35:10.340 --> 35:11.380
but I wanna talk about one more problem first.

35:11.380 --> 35:12.300
Yes, let's.

35:12.300 --> 35:13.500
We just talked about the philosophy

35:13.500 --> 35:15.100
of effective of altruism.

35:15.100 --> 35:17.420
I've covered recently on my YouTube channel,

35:17.420 --> 35:19.060
billionaire philanthropy.

35:19.060 --> 35:21.420
People like Bill Gates, Warren Buffett,

35:21.420 --> 35:23.380
Andrew Carnegie going back into history,

35:23.380 --> 35:25.540
this idea that billionaires can save the world

35:25.540 --> 35:27.060
by donating all of their money.

35:28.020 --> 35:29.460
And people can go watch that video

35:29.460 --> 35:33.340
if they wanna sort of see the full version of that debunking

35:33.340 --> 35:34.420
and my thoughts on it.

35:34.420 --> 35:36.540
But I wanna ask you about a specific example of it

35:36.540 --> 35:39.540
that's often presented as being a positive

35:39.540 --> 35:41.260
because I know you covered in the book.

35:41.260 --> 35:46.260
Mackenzie Scott, who is Jeff Bezos' ex-wife.

35:46.460 --> 35:47.300
I was gonna say widow.

35:47.300 --> 35:48.900
He's not dead, we can hope.

35:49.900 --> 35:54.460
His ex-wife, she received billions in the divorce,

35:54.460 --> 35:57.060
and she has been giving the money away like crazy.

35:57.060 --> 35:59.580
And people will often say in the comments of my videos,

35:59.580 --> 36:01.700
I'm Mackenzie Scott, now she's a great example.

36:01.700 --> 36:03.660
She's a good example of this

36:03.660 --> 36:05.940
because she's just trying to get rid of this shit.

36:05.940 --> 36:08.180
I'm curious what your take is on her.

36:08.180 --> 36:11.020
Well, it's very like, you're right, you're also right.

36:11.020 --> 36:12.860
A very kind of fiddler on the roof approach

36:12.860 --> 36:14.380
where it's like, you're right,

36:14.380 --> 36:18.100
she is doing it better than any billionaire, right?

36:18.100 --> 36:19.340
She's giving her money away

36:19.340 --> 36:22.220
in really admirable transformative ways.

36:22.220 --> 36:24.700
And what makes it better than how they give it away?

36:24.700 --> 36:27.140
She gives it away unrestricted.

36:27.140 --> 36:29.340
That's the number one thing.

36:29.340 --> 36:30.660
And I'll get back to that in a second,

36:30.660 --> 36:35.660
but the thing is that she is doing her philanthropy

36:35.660 --> 36:38.660
I think better than others, but because of that,

36:38.700 --> 36:42.260
you can see the limits of philanthropy's actual power

36:42.260 --> 36:44.060
to create social change.

36:44.060 --> 36:46.580
So I'll explain why.

36:46.580 --> 36:49.740
So Mackenzie Scott gives away

36:49.740 --> 36:51.980
tens of millions of dollars in tranches

36:51.980 --> 36:54.780
and she works with a team of consultants

36:54.780 --> 36:57.420
and they do a lot of vetting behind the scenes.

36:57.420 --> 37:00.820
And so unlike many situations where nonprofits

37:00.820 --> 37:03.060
have to write grant reports

37:03.060 --> 37:05.980
and massage all their language to fit a funder's,

37:05.980 --> 37:08.340
oh, we're really interested in this particular thing

37:08.340 --> 37:10.620
or can you make this about dogs somehow?

37:10.620 --> 37:12.220
There's like so much.

37:12.220 --> 37:13.620
I wanna build it with my name on it.

37:13.620 --> 37:15.100
Can I have a nice building?

37:15.100 --> 37:19.020
There's so much catering to the idiosyncratic preferences

37:19.020 --> 37:20.980
of funders and it takes up a ton of time

37:20.980 --> 37:22.700
and then you have to do reporting that shows like,

37:22.700 --> 37:25.140
oh, we spent the money on exactly the thing

37:25.140 --> 37:27.100
that we said we were gonna spend it on

37:27.100 --> 37:31.060
to, I think, very burdensome degrees, right?

37:31.060 --> 37:32.220
There's certainly a case to be made

37:32.220 --> 37:33.260
that you should do some of that,

37:33.260 --> 37:34.740
but this is very burdensome.

37:34.740 --> 37:37.140
Many nonprofits complain about this.

37:37.140 --> 37:38.660
So Mackenzie Scott instead,

37:38.660 --> 37:42.420
what she does is she just makes up her list with her team.

37:44.340 --> 37:47.340
Her team then calls the recipients and says,

37:47.340 --> 37:50.860
you've just been allocated some millions of dollars

37:50.860 --> 37:54.980
from Mackenzie Scott, unrestricted, very little reporting.

37:54.980 --> 37:57.380
Like you just got this giant windfall

37:57.380 --> 37:59.260
and you don't have to jump through all the hoops

37:59.260 --> 38:02.300
that you normally have to jump through to get funding.

38:02.300 --> 38:03.980
This is super transformative

38:03.980 --> 38:08.860
because what this does is displaces the stature

38:08.860 --> 38:12.220
and the power of Mackenzie as the donor

38:12.220 --> 38:15.140
and really says this is about just getting money to people

38:15.140 --> 38:17.020
and to go back to our theme of trust,

38:17.020 --> 38:19.220
trusting these institutions to use it

38:19.220 --> 38:20.660
in the way that they see fit.

38:20.660 --> 38:23.140
So there's a lot of giving away, not just of money,

38:23.140 --> 38:25.460
but of oversight and discretion,

38:25.460 --> 38:27.300
which is really a form of power.

38:27.300 --> 38:29.380
I think that's super admirable

38:29.380 --> 38:31.940
and I think that many people should be taking her example

38:31.940 --> 38:35.580
and not putting nonprofits through all of these paces

38:35.580 --> 38:36.860
to try and get all this money.

38:36.860 --> 38:38.260
And this is similar to when we were talking

38:38.260 --> 38:40.180
at the beginning of giving someone,

38:40.180 --> 38:42.540
hey, here's money, you know what to do best with it.

38:42.540 --> 38:43.660
I'm not worried that you're gonna spend it

38:43.660 --> 38:45.420
on the wrong thing, like alcohol.

38:45.420 --> 38:47.900
It's very similar to donating to an individual person.

38:47.900 --> 38:49.380
It gives them that trust

38:49.380 --> 38:51.220
and it deprioritizes you, the giver.

38:51.220 --> 38:52.060
That's good.

38:52.060 --> 38:54.700
Exactly, I think that's the best thing.

38:54.700 --> 38:57.140
Where I think you see the limits is,

38:57.140 --> 38:59.500
Mackenzie Scott has made many public statements

38:59.500 --> 39:01.620
where she talks about her concerns

39:01.620 --> 39:05.340
about social and economic justice, racial injustice,

39:05.340 --> 39:07.140
that she wants this money to go,

39:07.140 --> 39:11.060
not to elite institutions, but to HBCUs, for example,

39:11.060 --> 39:14.500
or she wants it to go to local social service organizations,

39:14.500 --> 39:18.420
things that are not priorities for the billionaire class.

39:18.420 --> 39:20.380
These are really gifts that she's making

39:20.380 --> 39:24.180
to organizations that serve poor,

39:24.180 --> 39:26.580
working and otherwise disenfranchised people

39:26.580 --> 39:27.660
in the United States.

39:27.700 --> 39:31.180
That's also great and great and unusual.

39:31.180 --> 39:34.780
The only problem is that for all of the money

39:34.780 --> 39:36.100
that she has and all the money

39:36.100 --> 39:38.300
that she's shoveling out the door,

39:38.300 --> 39:41.260
the metaphor I use in the book is Lucy and Ethel

39:41.260 --> 39:42.980
at the chocolate factory.

39:42.980 --> 39:45.260
It's like they can't wrap the chocolate fast enough

39:45.260 --> 39:48.260
to get it out the door like she desperately wants to.

39:48.260 --> 39:50.820
Unfortunately, her holdings of Amazon stock

39:50.820 --> 39:52.620
mean that she's just gonna keep accumulating money

39:52.620 --> 39:54.500
even faster than she can give it away.

39:54.500 --> 39:55.740
Wow.

39:55.740 --> 39:57.340
So that's one problem.

39:57.340 --> 39:58.180
Interesting.

39:58.180 --> 39:59.980
So she hasn't divested from the Amazon stock.

39:59.980 --> 40:03.580
She still has, the money is growing, what?

40:03.580 --> 40:05.660
Because Amazon stock price can be used, right?

40:05.660 --> 40:07.300
Now, this is as far as I know.

40:07.300 --> 40:09.620
Like I can't say I know the contents of her portfolio,

40:09.620 --> 40:11.740
but if we assume that it's from Amazon stock,

40:11.740 --> 40:16.420
then yes, her wealth is just growing at a faster rate

40:16.420 --> 40:19.780
than she could give it away even at this revolutionary pace.

40:19.780 --> 40:21.420
But she could give it away.

40:21.420 --> 40:23.620
I mean, it's possible to divest,

40:23.620 --> 40:26.180
but she's sort of still using an endowment sort of model

40:26.180 --> 40:29.580
where she has a big pot and then the proceeds

40:29.580 --> 40:31.580
from the investment is what is being given away.

40:31.580 --> 40:33.540
So her metaphor is she wants to give

40:33.540 --> 40:35.140
until the safe is empty.

40:35.140 --> 40:36.620
Now the problem with the safe is that

40:36.620 --> 40:38.780
there's like a static amount of money in there.

40:38.780 --> 40:40.500
It's not like, oh, it gets refilled

40:40.500 --> 40:43.300
and then you have to like continuously empty it.

40:43.300 --> 40:46.660
But there's a different strain of issue here,

40:46.660 --> 40:48.260
which is that she could,

40:48.260 --> 40:52.060
she could of course officially divest herself of her stock

40:52.060 --> 40:54.420
or she could put a billion dollars

40:54.420 --> 40:56.900
into the Amazon Worker Strike Fund.

40:56.900 --> 40:58.380
She could use this money,

40:58.380 --> 41:00.860
not in these kind of downstream palliative ways

41:00.860 --> 41:02.220
where she gives it to nonprofits

41:02.220 --> 41:06.620
that are trying to kind of make up for the deprivations

41:06.620 --> 41:09.260
that people face in a deeply unequal society.

41:09.260 --> 41:11.140
She could do something much more radical

41:11.140 --> 41:13.780
and confrontational with the amount of money that she has

41:13.780 --> 41:16.620
that would actually change labor relations,

41:16.620 --> 41:18.340
that would actually change policy,

41:18.340 --> 41:20.460
that might actually do something to prevent

41:20.460 --> 41:23.380
these conditions of inequality that so concern her.

41:23.380 --> 41:25.260
So this model of charitable giving

41:25.260 --> 41:28.060
as a mode of social justice,

41:28.060 --> 41:31.300
it kind of comes too late in the process.

41:31.300 --> 41:33.900
You would have to intervene upstream

41:33.900 --> 41:37.500
in our political system in a more confrontational way.

41:37.500 --> 41:40.140
So I think as chaired, as philanthropy, it's great,

41:40.140 --> 41:42.580
but as social justice, I think it's very limited.

41:42.580 --> 41:44.180
So, okay, that's really interesting

41:44.180 --> 41:45.340
because she's giving away the money

41:45.340 --> 41:46.940
in a way that deprioritizes her.

41:46.940 --> 41:48.740
But it sounds like what you're saying is the choices

41:48.740 --> 41:52.540
that she's making her priorities of who gets the money,

41:52.580 --> 41:54.660
it's still her team figuring it out,

41:54.660 --> 41:58.460
she still has some biases or some things

41:58.460 --> 42:00.060
she maybe doesn't quite understand.

42:00.060 --> 42:03.500
Maybe just, I would say some limitations, right?

42:03.500 --> 42:06.340
Like there's, I would love to see her go farther.

42:06.340 --> 42:11.340
I would love to see her become a champion of workers rights

42:12.140 --> 42:16.060
that would be much more revolutionary, much more radical,

42:16.060 --> 42:17.820
and it wouldn't just be redistributing money,

42:17.820 --> 42:20.620
it would be genuinely redistributing power.

42:20.620 --> 42:23.900
So let's talk about what kind of donation that would be.

42:23.900 --> 42:27.780
I mean, if one were to actually donate money

42:27.780 --> 42:29.100
to a place that would actually do these things,

42:29.100 --> 42:31.540
what sort of organizations are we talking about?

42:31.540 --> 42:34.420
So if we're talking about nonprofits,

42:34.420 --> 42:37.660
there are some excellent advocacy nonprofits.

42:37.660 --> 42:40.020
There's Americans for financial reform,

42:40.020 --> 42:43.020
there's demand progress, there's the revolving door project.

42:43.020 --> 42:46.220
There are a number of nonprofits that really seek to

42:46.220 --> 42:49.580
weaken the power of corporations in government.

42:49.580 --> 42:52.060
And again, I have to echo donating money

42:52.060 --> 42:54.340
to union strike funds would be an incredibly

42:54.340 --> 42:56.420
ballsy and revolutionary move.

42:56.420 --> 42:59.180
That would really be about giving workers the power

42:59.180 --> 43:01.380
to negotiate for their own conditions.

43:01.380 --> 43:02.860
Frankly, you could probably just give money

43:02.860 --> 43:05.140
to union networks more broadly.

43:05.140 --> 43:07.740
They all have operating foundations as well.

43:07.740 --> 43:11.100
So there's some confrontational giving

43:11.100 --> 43:15.220
that is right on the line between charitable giving,

43:15.220 --> 43:17.980
501c3 and a form of like political giving.

43:17.980 --> 43:19.860
You might even give it to a 501c4

43:19.860 --> 43:21.380
that more actively does lobbying.

43:21.380 --> 43:24.180
So that's one way to do it,

43:24.180 --> 43:26.260
where you would actually be giving to places

43:26.260 --> 43:30.380
that are challenging our policies and our norms

43:30.380 --> 43:33.740
and our dynamics of labor and race and power.

43:33.740 --> 43:37.700
And not just from a kind of marginal position,

43:37.700 --> 43:40.420
but really confrontationally in the halls of power.

43:40.420 --> 43:42.460
But there's still a problem there.

43:42.460 --> 43:45.300
Cause I imagine, I take your point very well.

43:45.300 --> 43:48.380
And as a member of two unions,

43:48.380 --> 43:52.100
one of which SAG-AFTRA did not have the strike fund

43:52.100 --> 43:56.180
set up as year round as the Writers Guild does

43:56.180 --> 43:57.940
and needed a lot of donations very quickly

43:57.940 --> 43:59.180
for that strike fund.

43:59.180 --> 44:02.620
If they were to suddenly have, hey, we're on strike.

44:02.620 --> 44:03.460
Well, guess what?

44:03.460 --> 44:06.220
Here's $500 million or whatever from Mackenzie Scott.

44:06.220 --> 44:09.740
That would have changed the strike enormously.

44:09.740 --> 44:11.980
It would have meant that actors could have,

44:11.980 --> 44:13.860
and by the way we're talking today,

44:13.860 --> 44:16.700
the day after the strike was resolved and ended.

44:16.700 --> 44:17.780
And congratulations on that.

44:17.780 --> 44:18.620
Thank you very much.

44:18.620 --> 44:20.540
I know you're very active on that board.

44:20.540 --> 44:22.340
Yeah, I'm active in the Writers Guild.

44:22.340 --> 44:24.780
I'm just a SAG-AFTRA member.

44:24.780 --> 44:26.580
But I'm an active member,

44:26.580 --> 44:28.700
but I don't serve in any leadership role.

44:28.700 --> 44:33.700
But if there was a strike fund that was 10 times

44:33.900 --> 44:35.820
what it had been,

44:35.820 --> 44:37.700
the membership would have been in a very different place.

44:37.700 --> 44:39.700
Maybe it could have held out even longer if necessary.

44:39.700 --> 44:40.940
I mean, hopefully not,

44:40.940 --> 44:44.300
but it would have changed the facts on the ground.

44:44.300 --> 44:46.100
It would have given the workers a lot more power.

44:46.100 --> 44:47.500
So I take that point,

44:47.500 --> 44:51.020
but I do wonder if she did have those priorities.

44:51.020 --> 44:56.020
If she said Mackenzie Scott divorces Jeff Bezos,

44:56.540 --> 45:00.180
and she reads a bunch of Jane McAleavy books

45:00.180 --> 45:02.980
and the Communist Manifesto

45:02.980 --> 45:06.380
and realizes that worker power is the most important thing

45:06.380 --> 45:09.940
and she wants to donate to those structural places, right?

45:09.940 --> 45:11.420
I could see someone making the argument.

45:11.420 --> 45:14.700
Well, now she's following her other set

45:14.700 --> 45:17.140
of ideological commitments and biases,

45:17.140 --> 45:20.900
which are still a fact about her, right?

45:20.900 --> 45:22.580
And maybe there's something even more efficient

45:22.580 --> 45:23.420
she could have done.

45:23.420 --> 45:25.140
Like, isn't part of the problem

45:25.140 --> 45:29.620
that one person is calling the shots at all,

45:29.620 --> 45:32.000
isn't, wouldn't it be better just to like,

45:32.900 --> 45:35.780
take the money away and let us vote on it?

45:35.780 --> 45:36.620
You know what I mean?

45:36.620 --> 45:37.740
Or something like that.

45:37.740 --> 45:40.940
Of course, that, yes,

45:40.940 --> 45:44.820
expropriating wealth for public use is a huge part of this.

45:44.820 --> 45:48.800
I think I'm thinking about what is in the short

45:48.800 --> 45:50.700
to medium horizon of possible.

45:50.700 --> 45:51.540
Yeah, of course.

45:51.540 --> 45:54.140
So I totally take your point and agree with you.

45:54.140 --> 45:56.900
And there's stuff in the book about how we change

45:56.900 --> 46:00.380
tax incentives and how we change our political economy

46:01.260 --> 46:02.420
for a number of reasons,

46:02.420 --> 46:03.960
but one being so that philanthropy

46:03.960 --> 46:05.900
is not this highly stratified activity

46:05.900 --> 46:08.060
that's only done by the mega rich,

46:08.060 --> 46:11.460
but that we have greater equality

46:11.460 --> 46:12.780
and democratization of wealth,

46:12.780 --> 46:15.740
such that we have democratization of giving as well.

46:16.620 --> 46:18.380
So I completely agree with you.

46:18.380 --> 46:21.860
That's really interesting, democratization of giving.

46:21.860 --> 46:23.380
So expand on that, please.

46:23.380 --> 46:26.020
So democratization of wealth really means

46:26.020 --> 46:29.220
a more equitable distribution of wealth.

46:29.220 --> 46:31.420
And democratization of giving would then mean

46:31.420 --> 46:33.380
more people had the discretionary income

46:33.380 --> 46:37.260
that they could participate even in small ways in giving.

46:37.260 --> 46:39.980
So one of the concepts that I put forth in the book

46:39.980 --> 46:44.980
is the idea of going beyond a living wage to a giving wage.

46:45.260 --> 46:48.500
So we have this idea of a living wage that would pay people.

46:48.500 --> 46:50.580
So apparently we need a special term to say

46:50.580 --> 46:52.780
workers are actually supposed to be able to live on

46:52.780 --> 46:53.700
what they earn.

46:53.700 --> 46:56.740
This is like already a paradigm change

46:56.740 --> 47:00.380
that we shouldn't need to have, but we're working on it.

47:00.380 --> 47:02.980
I suggest that we need to go even further

47:02.980 --> 47:05.020
and say people should be paid a giving wage.

47:05.020 --> 47:06.740
They should be paid enough

47:06.740 --> 47:10.060
that they can also afford even nominally to give back.

47:10.060 --> 47:12.340
So we're recording this a couple of weeks

47:12.340 --> 47:14.380
before Giving Tuesday, for example,

47:14.380 --> 47:16.020
like this day after Thanksgiving,

47:16.020 --> 47:19.060
which is one of the largest days of giving in the year,

47:19.060 --> 47:20.500
right before giving season starts,

47:20.500 --> 47:22.820
30% of all gifts are made in December.

47:22.820 --> 47:27.100
So my sense is giving is really one expression

47:27.100 --> 47:28.900
of the health of our democracy.

47:28.900 --> 47:32.100
And so I would wanna see people paid more

47:33.180 --> 47:38.180
and with more robust social welfare policies

47:38.220 --> 47:40.860
that enable us all the security and the freedom

47:40.860 --> 47:43.460
to give to things that actually enable human flourishing

47:43.460 --> 47:44.660
in our communities.

47:44.660 --> 47:46.860
Yeah, if we were,

47:46.860 --> 47:49.900
if we had a more equitable economy overall,

47:49.900 --> 47:52.500
then more people would be able to donate

47:52.500 --> 47:54.900
and we wouldn't have the equity problems

47:54.900 --> 47:56.420
that we do with philanthropy

47:56.420 --> 47:59.460
because it would be overall more democratic.

47:59.460 --> 48:02.420
And actually the labor movement

48:02.460 --> 48:03.820
is maybe a good example of this

48:03.820 --> 48:07.420
because folks who have union jobs generally,

48:07.420 --> 48:10.300
on average earn more than folks who do not.

48:10.300 --> 48:13.060
And part of a small percentage,

48:13.060 --> 48:15.460
I forget what my total dues are,

48:15.460 --> 48:19.900
a percent or so of my salary goes to the union,

48:19.900 --> 48:24.900
which is a not for profit that works for the benefit

48:25.300 --> 48:28.700
of me and others in my industry and community.

48:28.700 --> 48:30.180
It's not quite a charity,

48:30.180 --> 48:31.620
but it's sort of an example of this

48:31.620 --> 48:36.620
where the labor movement is this durable nonprofit

48:36.900 --> 48:41.260
power center for workers' rights and for equality

48:41.260 --> 48:45.100
and generally green things

48:45.100 --> 48:46.980
and all the good things that we like.

48:46.980 --> 48:51.100
And it is funded by the fact that the workers,

48:51.100 --> 48:52.940
the workers each chipping in a little bit,

48:52.940 --> 48:54.740
which they're able to do because they're all paid more.

48:54.740 --> 48:55.860
Exactly.

48:55.860 --> 48:58.340
And to expand,

48:58.340 --> 49:01.060
yes, the unions are a crucial example of this.

49:01.060 --> 49:04.540
And then there are parts of our lives

49:04.540 --> 49:06.420
that really secure our quality of life.

49:06.420 --> 49:07.700
They might be our parks,

49:07.700 --> 49:09.540
they might be cultural institutions,

49:09.540 --> 49:11.820
they might be houses of worship,

49:11.820 --> 49:13.860
they might be recreation centers.

49:13.860 --> 49:17.660
Like if we think about those as power centers as well,

49:17.660 --> 49:20.820
places that really affirm human worth

49:20.820 --> 49:22.620
beyond our economic productivity,

49:22.620 --> 49:26.020
places that really cultivate human community and connection,

49:26.020 --> 49:27.740
that is a form of building power.

49:27.780 --> 49:31.540
That is a form of affirming human value and human worth

49:31.540 --> 49:34.820
beyond our economic productivity.

49:34.820 --> 49:36.060
Yeah, is it?

49:36.060 --> 49:37.860
I gotta say though, you mentioned churches, right?

49:37.860 --> 49:41.700
And churches are probably the most common form

49:41.700 --> 49:44.100
of community-based philanthropy.

49:44.100 --> 49:45.940
Many, many Americans are members of churches.

49:45.940 --> 49:49.540
Many churches have an ideology of you should chip in a bit.

49:49.540 --> 49:51.980
And some religions or some denominations,

49:51.980 --> 49:55.380
that's tithing where people donate a lot of their income.

49:55.380 --> 49:56.380
And I have to say,

49:56.380 --> 49:58.820
not all those churches are institutions

49:58.820 --> 50:01.420
that spend money in ways that benefit society.

50:01.420 --> 50:03.060
Some of them spend money in ways that benefit

50:03.060 --> 50:04.460
only the people who go to the church,

50:04.460 --> 50:05.660
that protect wealth,

50:05.660 --> 50:09.420
that there are some very regressive churches out there.

50:09.420 --> 50:12.660
And so I'm wondering if our desire

50:12.660 --> 50:14.980
to have a version of philanthropy

50:14.980 --> 50:19.340
that is going to be good in every respect is a problem.

50:19.340 --> 50:21.500
I mean, I said a second ago, right?

50:21.500 --> 50:22.820
What if we just take the money away

50:22.820 --> 50:24.900
and we all vote on what to do with it, right?

50:24.900 --> 50:27.140
And it's very easy for me to say.

50:27.140 --> 50:28.860
Ha, ha, ha, fuck the billionaires, take the money away,

50:28.860 --> 50:30.980
let's all vote, let's have it be democratic.

50:30.980 --> 50:33.020
Unfortunately, we do currently have a system

50:33.020 --> 50:35.180
where we do that to some extent, it's called taxes.

50:35.180 --> 50:37.580
And I think if any single person in the country

50:37.580 --> 50:40.060
were to look at what taxes are spent on,

50:40.060 --> 50:41.780
every single person in the country would say,

50:41.780 --> 50:43.820
I fucking hate a lot of this, right?

50:43.820 --> 50:47.060
And that's because democracy is a fucking mess.

50:47.060 --> 50:48.460
And people do not agree,

50:48.460 --> 50:50.860
and there's a lot of assholes in every society,

50:50.860 --> 50:53.020
and there's power imbalances in society,

50:53.020 --> 50:55.060
and there's hierarchies, and there's,

50:55.060 --> 50:57.060
people, corporations are able to say,

50:57.060 --> 50:58.660
oh, hold on, there's a lot of money being given out,

50:58.660 --> 50:59.780
why don't we get some for ourselves?

50:59.780 --> 51:02.580
We're powerful enough that we can,

51:02.580 --> 51:05.940
military industrial complex and all that shit, right?

51:05.940 --> 51:10.940
And it sort of seems like in order to find that path

51:11.940 --> 51:13.820
to a positive philanthropy,

51:13.820 --> 51:17.940
we need to solve every power-based problem in society,

51:17.940 --> 51:20.100
which seems like a tall order.

51:20.100 --> 51:21.300
When you put it that way.

51:22.300 --> 51:23.220
I'm very sorry,

51:23.220 --> 51:25.540
do you have an answer to this question in your book?

51:25.540 --> 51:27.740
It's called how to fix philanthropy,

51:27.740 --> 51:29.460
how to fix everything.

51:29.460 --> 51:34.460
But I guess to me, I see having this diversified set

51:34.460 --> 51:37.580
of tactics of how we can use money for social good

51:37.580 --> 51:40.860
kind of offsets some of the challenges

51:40.860 --> 51:42.060
that you just listed.

51:42.060 --> 51:45.780
So there's a story in the book that points out exactly

51:45.780 --> 51:46.660
what you said that like,

51:46.660 --> 51:49.100
even our democratically elected governments

51:49.300 --> 51:51.820
are not always going to have the interests

51:51.820 --> 51:54.020
of human flourishing at heart, right?

51:54.020 --> 51:55.780
They might be hostile.

51:55.780 --> 51:59.540
And so, you know, as much as the leftist in me is concerned

51:59.540 --> 52:02.020
that what I'm saying is, you know,

52:02.020 --> 52:05.340
a libertarian or otherwise mistrustful of government,

52:05.340 --> 52:08.700
I do think there's something to be said for pluralism.

52:08.700 --> 52:12.060
So the story is that in the late 90s,

52:12.060 --> 52:14.420
Rudy Giuliani, the then mayor of New York,

52:14.420 --> 52:18.940
wanted to sell off about 140 plots of land

52:18.980 --> 52:22.340
that were allocated for community gardens.

52:22.340 --> 52:24.220
And he wanted to sell them to developers

52:24.220 --> 52:26.540
and his argument was somehow like, we need this land,

52:26.540 --> 52:27.700
we need it for housing.

52:27.700 --> 52:32.700
These gardens are just, you know, these elite spaces

52:33.500 --> 52:35.820
that are just kind of draining public resources.

52:35.820 --> 52:37.060
And really what he meant was,

52:37.060 --> 52:38.660
this is not economically productive.

52:38.660 --> 52:39.580
This is not right.

52:39.580 --> 52:41.100
So.

52:41.100 --> 52:43.100
And these sort of spaces, by the way,

52:43.100 --> 52:44.740
are one of the things that make New York City

52:44.740 --> 52:46.180
a wonderful city that it is,

52:46.180 --> 52:48.860
this is a city where we're recording in New York right now,

52:48.860 --> 52:51.100
you walk around like, oh, there's a tiny little park.

52:51.100 --> 52:53.020
It's just like the size of one little building.

52:53.020 --> 52:54.140
At some point they knocked down a building

52:54.140 --> 52:55.020
and built a little park there.

52:55.020 --> 52:57.780
And it's one of the beautiful things.

52:57.780 --> 52:58.980
Not only did they knock down a building,

52:58.980 --> 53:02.620
but it was actually largely black and Latinx communities

53:02.620 --> 53:05.300
that took over vacant lots in the 1970s

53:05.300 --> 53:06.860
and turned them into these gardens.

53:06.860 --> 53:09.580
So they're actually our legacies of, you know,

53:09.580 --> 53:12.300
people of color and grassroots reclaiming

53:12.300 --> 53:14.340
of public space and building their communities.

53:14.340 --> 53:19.020
So what the short version of what saved these spaces

53:19.020 --> 53:23.420
is a fundraising campaign spearheaded by Bette Midler

53:23.420 --> 53:27.300
that for $2.4 million bought these plots

53:27.300 --> 53:29.380
and then donated them to a land trust,

53:29.380 --> 53:31.620
donated them to New York City land trust.

53:31.620 --> 53:34.140
So there's this way in which philanthropy

53:34.140 --> 53:39.140
can be this lever of using money for like humanism

53:39.820 --> 53:44.820
even in the undesirable moments

53:45.060 --> 53:46.980
when our governments do not have that

53:46.980 --> 53:48.700
in their core interests.

53:48.700 --> 53:52.340
So you actually feel that philanthropy

53:52.340 --> 53:55.100
is not by itself bad.

53:55.100 --> 53:58.740
It's the way we've been going about it.

53:58.740 --> 54:00.940
It's the over prioritization

54:00.940 --> 54:04.700
and that there is a version of philanthropy

54:04.700 --> 54:06.540
that would be productive.

54:06.580 --> 54:10.300
There is a thing that Warren Buffett could do

54:10.300 --> 54:12.620
that would be net positive.

54:12.620 --> 54:16.540
So the best story I can give you to exemplify this,

54:16.540 --> 54:17.660
it's the last part of the book

54:17.660 --> 54:19.740
and it's a profile of LeBron James.

54:19.740 --> 54:23.180
So LeBron has a network of institutions

54:23.180 --> 54:27.220
that his foundation has helped start in Akron, Ohio.

54:27.220 --> 54:30.740
And the first of them is the I Promise School.

54:30.740 --> 54:33.540
And I wanna just say really importantly off the top,

54:33.540 --> 54:36.340
the I Promise School is a public school.

54:36.340 --> 54:38.860
It has a collective bargaining agreement for the teachers.

54:38.860 --> 54:40.580
It is not a charter school

54:40.580 --> 54:42.460
that might be the most revolutionary thing about it.

54:42.460 --> 54:44.380
So let's be clear that this is philanthropy

54:44.380 --> 54:47.020
in partnership with public goods,

54:47.020 --> 54:49.580
with like democratically funded public goods,

54:49.580 --> 54:51.380
public institutions, public schools.

54:51.380 --> 54:53.140
So there's the I Promise School

54:53.140 --> 54:55.540
that has public governance,

54:55.540 --> 54:57.740
but the LeBron James Family Foundation

54:57.740 --> 55:00.420
and its partners fund this huge suite

55:00.420 --> 55:01.900
of wraparound services.

55:01.900 --> 55:06.460
They have food pickup for breakfast, lunch and dinner

55:06.460 --> 55:07.300
for the families.

55:07.300 --> 55:10.820
There's a barber shop for the parents of the kids

55:10.820 --> 55:13.500
and every kid gets a bike and a helmet.

55:13.500 --> 55:14.740
Why?

55:14.740 --> 55:16.660
Because when LeBron was asked about the bikes,

55:16.660 --> 55:18.460
he said, when I was a kid,

55:18.460 --> 55:21.620
having a bike was what made me feel free.

55:22.980 --> 55:25.780
That to me is like, how do you use money

55:25.780 --> 55:30.300
to value the unquantifiable, the human spirit,

55:30.300 --> 55:31.140
the intangible?

55:31.140 --> 55:34.780
There's no balance sheet that can quantify feeling free.

55:34.780 --> 55:37.060
And that's what the philanthropy that he gives

55:37.060 --> 55:42.060
can provide alongside the very critical basic services.

55:42.220 --> 55:43.660
And is there something that,

55:43.660 --> 55:45.220
because you say that and it makes me think,

55:45.220 --> 55:47.580
well, you know, that made LeBron feel free.

55:47.580 --> 55:49.420
Maybe something else would make some other kid feel free.

55:49.420 --> 55:50.260
Absolutely.

55:50.260 --> 55:53.620
Maybe a fucking, I felt free when I had a Super Nintendo.

55:55.460 --> 55:57.300
And so, is there something about this

55:57.300 --> 55:59.100
that makes us avoid that pitfall

55:59.100 --> 56:00.820
of LeBron deciding for everybody else?

56:01.700 --> 56:03.740
No, I'm not avoiding that pitfall.

56:03.740 --> 56:05.620
I'm not gonna pretend that we are.

56:05.620 --> 56:07.580
It's true, he does decide,

56:07.580 --> 56:09.700
but it's a very embedded decision.

56:09.700 --> 56:12.340
It's embedded in his upbringing,

56:12.340 --> 56:14.500
in his relationships, in his knowledge.

56:14.500 --> 56:15.340
Because he's from there.

56:15.340 --> 56:17.900
He actually, at the opening of I Promise, he said,

56:18.980 --> 56:21.900
I know what the kids who go to the school are going through.

56:21.900 --> 56:23.020
I know the dreams they have.

56:23.020 --> 56:24.780
I know the nightmares they have.

56:24.780 --> 56:27.060
So it's very deeply empathetic

56:27.060 --> 56:29.540
and connected about that.

56:29.580 --> 56:33.340
So it's not just, I woke up and I had this quixotic idea

56:33.340 --> 56:34.740
that we should just give kids bikes.

56:34.740 --> 56:37.620
Like, no, I do know, because I was this kid.

56:37.620 --> 56:39.500
Yeah, he didn't do the,

56:39.500 --> 56:41.940
let's contrast with what Mark Zuckerberg did

56:41.940 --> 56:44.260
with the Newark schools, I think.

56:44.260 --> 56:45.100
Yes.

56:45.100 --> 56:45.940
Which I think is a bad story.

56:45.940 --> 56:46.780
Do you remember the details?

56:46.780 --> 56:48.980
Exactly, I'm not very well, I just talked about it.

56:48.980 --> 56:53.540
And so, he wanted to kind of parachute into Newark

56:53.540 --> 56:54.700
with a hundred million dollars

56:54.700 --> 56:57.180
and revolutionized their school system,

56:57.220 --> 56:59.460
only to create redistricting maps

56:59.460 --> 57:00.460
that didn't take into account

57:00.460 --> 57:02.300
where their kids would need to cross highways

57:02.300 --> 57:03.500
to get to school.

57:03.500 --> 57:06.260
This is one small example of the life.

57:06.260 --> 57:07.100
He's not from there.

57:07.100 --> 57:08.100
LeBron would make that mistake.

57:08.100 --> 57:10.740
LeBron's like, no way, no kids crossing that,

57:10.740 --> 57:12.420
like, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.

57:12.420 --> 57:13.700
These people go to the schools,

57:13.700 --> 57:15.540
like we, I know how the community works.

57:15.540 --> 57:16.380
Exactly.

57:16.380 --> 57:17.420
As opposed to parachuting in.

57:17.420 --> 57:18.260
Exactly.

57:18.260 --> 57:19.300
I know how the community works

57:19.300 --> 57:22.340
and I'm going to partner with the institutions

57:22.340 --> 57:24.900
that are governed by like public officials

57:24.900 --> 57:26.500
and you know, public funding.

57:26.540 --> 57:28.820
So there's also not that kind of takeover

57:28.820 --> 57:32.020
of like now I'm going to become the Mr. Potter of Akron,

57:32.020 --> 57:34.420
you know, who just like controls everything.

57:34.420 --> 57:36.980
There's a real interconnectedness to how he does it.

57:36.980 --> 57:39.820
And that to me is what I would like philanthropy to do

57:39.820 --> 57:42.540
is to exist in equilibrium and in partnership,

57:42.540 --> 57:45.500
but with a very unique understanding of its role

57:45.500 --> 57:48.020
that like we absolutely need government for,

57:48.020 --> 57:49.780
I say in the book, we need government for bread

57:49.780 --> 57:51.580
and philanthropy for roses.

57:51.580 --> 57:53.820
So, oh.

57:53.820 --> 57:54.700
Expand on that please.

57:54.700 --> 57:55.660
Absolutely.

57:55.660 --> 57:58.740
Now, of course, this is much too need of a divide.

57:58.740 --> 58:01.100
There's lots of places where this, you know,

58:01.100 --> 58:03.420
can blend together in ways you have to work out,

58:03.420 --> 58:05.380
but bread and roses is, as you might know,

58:05.380 --> 58:08.860
the union slogan of we don't just need sustenance,

58:08.860 --> 58:12.340
we need quality of life, we need things that bring us joy,

58:12.340 --> 58:13.780
we need culture, we need music,

58:13.780 --> 58:17.620
we need things that connect us to our souls.

58:17.620 --> 58:20.580
And so again, my sense is like we absolutely need

58:20.580 --> 58:22.820
a government that does a much better job

58:22.820 --> 58:23.900
than our current government does

58:23.900 --> 58:25.900
with providing for our basic needs,

58:25.900 --> 58:27.980
but we also need roses and we,

58:27.980 --> 58:30.140
I don't know that we can necessarily assume

58:30.140 --> 58:32.540
that our government will have the means

58:32.540 --> 58:34.780
or the priorities that allow for that.

58:34.780 --> 58:37.820
And philanthropy has the flexibility to do that

58:37.820 --> 58:39.500
if it does so in proper deference

58:39.500 --> 58:41.940
to the authorities of our government.

58:41.940 --> 58:44.740
And so let's talk about that deference.

58:44.740 --> 58:46.500
Deference to the authorities of our government,

58:46.500 --> 58:48.980
meaning in the case of Akron,

58:48.980 --> 58:51.940
the democratically elected school board,

58:51.940 --> 58:56.220
probably the parent associations, PTAs, whatever,

58:56.220 --> 58:58.140
all the various community organs

58:58.140 --> 59:00.300
that know what is needed there.

59:00.300 --> 59:02.020
Right, all the things that make it

59:02.020 --> 59:04.020
very ineffective altruism, right?

59:04.020 --> 59:05.900
Like all of these kinds of these,

59:05.900 --> 59:08.940
there are relationships of friction and negotiation

59:08.940 --> 59:11.900
and solidarity and just juncture

59:11.900 --> 59:13.980
that have to be contested.

59:13.980 --> 59:16.740
They have to be like democratically contested.

59:16.740 --> 59:18.540
That's what it means to be in relationship,

59:18.540 --> 59:20.900
but you're doing so with a sense

59:20.900 --> 59:22.420
that like you are ultimately there

59:22.420 --> 59:26.060
to help provide the things that keep people human,

59:26.060 --> 59:27.460
the things that bring them joy,

59:27.460 --> 59:29.540
the things that really connect them to one another.

59:29.540 --> 59:31.540
And so there's a humility to that

59:31.540 --> 59:33.060
and a clear sense of purpose.

59:33.060 --> 59:36.900
Yes, and especially when you are in deference

59:36.900 --> 59:40.260
to the organizations within the government

59:40.260 --> 59:43.060
that are specifically democratic,

59:43.060 --> 59:44.620
that are coming from the bottom up.

59:44.620 --> 59:45.780
And when I was saying,

59:45.780 --> 59:47.220
hey, a lot of the stuff in the budget

59:47.220 --> 59:49.180
of the federal government I don't like,

59:49.180 --> 59:51.220
a lot of that is driven by the parts

59:51.220 --> 59:52.340
that are not democratic.

59:52.340 --> 59:54.940
That's driven by corporations having too much power

59:54.940 --> 59:57.340
and the people not having enough power.

59:57.340 --> 01:00:00.620
And if we instead are working in deference

01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:03.860
to the parts of the government that are democratic,

01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:04.980
where the people do have a voice,

01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:06.460
then we're on the right path maybe.

01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:08.140
I think we are, I think we are.

01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:09.740
So for this Giving Tuesday.

01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:10.580
Yes.

01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:14.980
If people, you know, around this time of year,

01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:17.820
I do think about how fortunate I am

01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:20.100
to be doing a podcast and YouTube videos

01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:22.180
and to have a little bit of disposable income.

01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:27.180
And I want to make sure that I am sharing it with others

01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:28.820
and making the world a better place

01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:30.260
in ways that matter to me.

01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:33.220
What do you suggest that people, you know,

01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:34.380
think about where they start

01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:36.100
with their own philanthropic activities

01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:37.740
to make sure they're not falling into these?

01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:39.380
Because again, I spent five years

01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:40.820
following the effective altruists.

01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:43.020
And I don't mind that my money went to bed nets,

01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:46.060
but now I'm like, I could have done a little better.

01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:48.220
There's a balance to strike between giving

01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:49.220
for the world we have

01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:51.580
and giving for the world we want to build, right?

01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:54.780
So I would never say like just give

01:00:54.780 --> 01:00:58.300
to these sort of evergreen pursuits of culture

01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:00.220
and recreation and parks

01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:02.500
because that might feel tone deaf

01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:06.860
based on the serious local international crises

01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:07.980
that we find ourselves in.

01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:10.180
So I don't want to be absolutist about this,

01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:12.820
but I would say if anything strive for a balance

01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:17.620
between being responsive to the world that we have

01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:21.740
and responsive to genuine vulnerability

01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:25.140
and genuine crisis that is readily accessible

01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:27.300
to all of us if we look around,

01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:29.820
but also consider what can you give

01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:31.260
and where can you give

01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:34.340
that keeps you in relationship with others

01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:37.780
that allows you and others to gather, to explore,

01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:40.180
to flourish, to grow and connect.

01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:41.980
What institutions can you give

01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:44.300
that might be locally, they might be nationally,

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:46.500
but what can you do that kind of fosters

01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:48.020
human flourishing with your giving?

01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:51.260
Do you have an example or even one from your own life

01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:54.060
of something like that sort of local thing

01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:56.500
that folks can be in partnership with?

01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:57.500
Absolutely.

01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:01.940
So again, in New York, I support my community garden.

01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:03.460
That's a small thing.

01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:08.220
I also support museums ranging from ones that are,

01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:10.580
the name brands that might be like the Met

01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:11.700
or the Brooklyn Museum.

01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:14.300
And I especially give to those

01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:17.300
that are freely accessible to others,

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:20.140
that really allow for free admission

01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:22.260
because that feels the most sort of democratic

01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:27.060
and inclusive way of sharing that quality of life with others.

01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:28.620
I have been on the board

01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:30.500
of some men called the Chautauqua Institution,

01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:31.620
the Young People's Board.

01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:32.980
That's a place I grew up going

01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:35.300
that really fostered these values in me.

01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:37.460
I come from Cleveland, not far from Akron.

01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:40.300
So shout out to Northeast Ohio.

01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:45.300
And so I would give to local social service organizations

01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:47.660
there and also to museums there.

01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:50.300
And I should say like not just ones that are,

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:53.020
again, those name brands, but maybe smaller ones.

01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:55.860
They might be local things that work with the schools.

01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:58.620
They might be a dance troupe

01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:01.380
that meets at your local community center

01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:04.580
that people really value or a recreation center.

01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:06.780
Again, stuff that brings people together

01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:09.260
in a way that I think is missing so much of the time.

01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:12.020
And in terms of building worker power

01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:14.220
or power for average people like that,

01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:15.060
we were talking about,

01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:16.660
wouldn't it be great if Mackenzie Scott

01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:18.140
donated organizations like that?

01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:20.580
What sort of organizations are you thinking of

01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:22.980
and how do people go about finding them?

01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:25.380
Well, first of all, I would say definitely look

01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:28.260
and see if there are workers on strike

01:03:28.260 --> 01:03:29.860
and just give to those strike funds.

01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:32.780
That's definitely a great place to start.

01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:35.700
The strike funds that the union asks you to donate to,

01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:36.540
very important.

01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:37.380
That's a great point.

01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:39.660
If you want to support a strike,

01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:42.820
you have to look at how is the union asking you to support

01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:45.380
because sometimes there'll be other funds around the edges

01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:49.020
that are not really, you defer to the union, right?

01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:51.660
Yeah, I agree completely.

01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:53.780
And so the nonprofits that I mentioned before

01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:58.540
that I think are really smart about translating advocacy

01:03:58.540 --> 01:04:03.540
on behalf of the workers and the sort of populists

01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:06.940
of the United States are really great.

01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:08.100
That would be demand progress.

01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:10.180
That would be Americans for financial reform.

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:12.860
They're really good at translating demands of the people

01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:13.980
into real policy.

01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:15.900
So those would be my other recommendations there.

01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:19.020
I'll tell you my own part from my donations this year

01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:24.020
is I've given to the Emergency Workers Organizing Committee,

01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:26.180
collective, I forget which,

01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:30.420
which is a group that anybody around the country can call

01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:31.700
and get connected with an organizer

01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:33.180
if you're trying to unionize.

01:04:33.180 --> 01:04:35.180
EWALK, really great organization

01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:38.460
that comes out of a union effort.

01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:42.700
And I am looking for a trans-legal defense charity

01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:45.220
because that's, I think, a very important legal issue

01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:47.980
right now and those are folks who are really doing

01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:52.500
the very basic on-the-ground legal and political work

01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:55.260
to get some of the folks who need power built

01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:58.620
in our society, most the power that they need.

01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:01.980
But I'm looking to, as you say,

01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:05.540
find a place that I can have a relationship with

01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:08.180
where it's not just like, oh, hey, I'm, you know,

01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:10.100
take the money and run or whatever,

01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:12.780
but like, you know, where are the places

01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:16.100
that are working most closely in their own community?

01:05:16.100 --> 01:05:20.500
Not just doing the parachuting in like top-down work,

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:23.020
but, you know, actually providing legal aid

01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:25.060
to folks who need it, you know?

01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:25.900
I do.

01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:29.260
And I totally second that recommendation.

01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:32.300
And I think that will sort of require listeners

01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:34.940
to look in their own communities.

01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:35.780
Yes, exactly.

01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:38.380
And kind of just use your sort of embedded networks

01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:40.500
and your embedded knowledge about, you know,

01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:43.940
where do you feel things are really making a difference

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:46.500
in helping people flourish in the place where you live.

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:48.140
That's so wonderful.

01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:51.020
