0	1440	Hello, and welcome to Factually.
1440	2320	I'm Adam Conover.
2320	4080	Thank you so much for joining me on the show again.
4080	5560	You know, it's giving season,
5560	7240	and if you're like me, you might be wondering,
7240	9640	where the hell should I give my money?
9640	11840	I mean, you want to make the world a better place, right?
11840	14240	But it's difficult to know what charity
14240	15960	or organization to donate to
15960	17600	that's actually going to make a difference,
17600	18840	especially because, you know,
18840	20400	we've got a world full of billionaires
20400	21960	donating money all the time,
21960	24400	and the world doesn't actually seem to be getting better, right?
24400	28200	So how do we actually make an improvement with our money?
28200	29520	Well, a couple years ago,
29520	31800	a savior emerged in the form of a movement
31800	33920	called effective altruism.
33920	37360	This was a group of scientists, philosophers, and researchers
37360	39400	who pledged to use their huge brains
39400	43040	to figure out what the most effective forms of charity were.
43040	46000	They did rigorous research, they conducted studies,
46000	47320	they held conferences,
47320	49920	and they convinced a lot of very rich people
49920	51840	to donate huge amounts of money
51840	53640	for the betterment of humanity.
53640	56200	It seemed like a really great thing
56200	57720	until a couple years later
57720	59880	when the entire movement collapsed.
59880	62760	It turns out they got into bed with the crypto fraudsters
62760	64160	like Sam Bankman Freed,
64160	66560	and now the entire philosophical movement
66560	70640	behind effective altruism has been largely discredited.
70640	71720	How did this happen?
71720	73160	How did a group of people
73160	74920	dedicated to figuring out the best
74920	77560	and most selfless ways to better humanity
77560	80200	get embroiled in one of the largest financial frauds
80200	81360	of all time?
81360	83680	Is it even possible for philanthropy
83680	86560	to do good in the world when things like this happen?
86560	89840	And how can average people like you or me
89840	92720	donate money to actually make the world
92720	95000	a better place this giving season?
95000	96720	Well, to answer these questions,
96720	99360	we have an incredible guest on the show.
99360	100960	But before we get to that, I wanna remind you

128920	130920	And now let's get to today's guest.
130920	132440	Her name is Amy Schiller.
132440	133960	She's a writer and academic
133960	136320	who worked in the world of philanthropy for years.
136320	138000	But now she has a new book out
138000	139600	called The Price of Humanity,
139600	142840	How Philanthropy Went Wrong and How to Fix It.
142840	145520	It is such a smart and entertaining take
145520	148080	on this entire industry and everything that plagues it
148080	150800	and how you can actually make the world a better place.
150800	151920	So without further ado,
151920	154120	let's get to this interview with Amy Schiller.
156680	158320	Amy, thank you so much for being on the show.
158320	159680	It's such a pleasure to be here.
159680	161520	I'm so excited to meet you.
161520	162360	Oh, that's really nice.
162360	164160	I'm very excited to meet you.
164160	168200	Because I've been covering for a long time
168200	169400	the problems with philanthropy.
169400	172760	Philanthropy is proposed to us as this wonderful thing.
172760	174440	It's how the rich change the world.
174440	175400	You can do it yourself.
175400	176360	You can contribute.
176360	179880	What could possibly be bad about giving money away?
179880	181720	You have written an entire book
181720	185320	called The Price of Humanity, How Philanthropy Went Wrong.
185320	186680	The entire thing.
186680	188320	How did philanthropy go wrong?
188320	189440	What is the problem with it?
189440	191520	I'll tell you how I think philanthropy went wrong
191520	194080	because you have very ably covered many ways
194080	194920	that it's gone wrong.
194920	196760	But here's what I think has gone wrong.
196760	201760	It's drifted from the actual meaning of the word philanthropy.
202360	204240	So for me, the entry point is
204240	207440	philanthropy means love of humanity.
207440	211040	And my concern is that I saw a lot of philanthropic
211040	215080	movements and trends moving towards a definition
215080	218960	of humanity that to me felt very narrow and reductive.
218960	222640	So this all comes down to how we define humanity.
222640	226920	Is humanity sustenance merely surviving?
226920	229360	Or is humanity really about thriving
229360	232120	and our full human capabilities to flourish
232160	235640	and to create new things in common with one another?
235640	237640	So my feeling is philanthropy went wrong
237640	240800	when it started to become a utilitarian practice
240800	243880	and not an enabler of human flourishing.
243880	245560	And I think the word utilitarian
245560	247960	is gonna come up a couple of times in this conversation.
247960	252240	But what's an example of somebody getting that wrong
252240	253920	so I can understand more better what you mean?
253920	255040	Absolutely.
255040	259000	Well, I'll jump into the sort of hot button version of it
259000	262240	which is effective altruism embodied
262240	266000	by now disgraced fraudster Sam Bankman-Freed
266000	268760	but having a long trajectory before that,
268760	271360	beginning as a philosophy that basically said,
272440	276600	we can rank the moral worth of giving
276600	280280	based on how many lives per dollar we save.
280280	284720	So a very narrow definition of what constituted
284720	288480	valid philanthropy and what philanthropy's purpose was.
288520	291840	And let me say, I first encountered the idea
291840	294920	of effective altruism close to 10 years ago.
294920	297400	I actually, in my first show, Adam Ruins,
297400	301000	everything had some effective altruism adjacent ideas.
301000	302800	For instance, in our very first episode,
302800	303920	which was called Adam Ruins Giving,
303920	305720	it was the pilot of the whole show.
305720	308320	We did a whole segment on how you shouldn't give food
308320	310520	to food banks, you should give money to food banks
310520	313040	because giving food makes you feel good.
313040	314600	Giving money actually helps them the most
314600	315580	because then they can buy the foods
315580	317320	that people actually need.
317320	319440	We made fun of Tom's shoes for giving away
319440	323280	these free shoes when like, why not just give money, right?
323280	324320	Why not give the thing?
324320	327000	Why not trust people to make their own decisions?
327000	328320	Absolutely.
328320	330920	And I think there's a lot of validity to that.
330920	334640	And it, I still think there is to some degree.
334640	339640	It also dovetails with a very rigorous evidence-based approach
341720	343960	that it's like, hey, if we actually,
343960	345120	a lot of charity goes to waste,
345160	346840	if you actually wanna make sure
346840	349120	that the money that you donate goes to the right place,
349120	352080	well, then you should be able to like really rigorously
352080	354720	show that it has had a positive effect.
354720	356040	There are groups like Givewell
356040	357320	that would do these really rigorous studies.
357320	360240	I would read them and look at their recommendations.
360240	361920	And then it was all based on,
361920	364600	yeah, the utilitarian philosophy of Peter Singer, right?
364600	367000	Which is that, I mean, you can probably express it better
367000	369920	than I can, but you know, the sort of general philosophy
369920	373000	of like the ends are the most important thing.
373000	375200	The number of lives saved, the amount of pain
375200	377720	and suffering that you've prevented in the world.
377720	379160	And I always knew, look,
379160	381280	as the holder of a bachelor's in philosophy,
381280	383120	I always knew there's no, you know,
383120	385800	that philosophy isn't necessarily true in all respects,
385800	387520	but it's defensible, right?
387520	388520	It's respectable.
388520	390320	There's a lot of validity to it.
390320	392480	So I always enjoyed this sort of,
392480	395000	oh, very rigorous view of philanthropy.
395000	397240	And for a bunch of years, I would donate money
397240	399560	according to the effective altruist donations
399560	401800	to the Against Malaria Foundation.
401800	403000	That was always the best ranked one.
403000	407040	That was like for every couple thousand dollars
407040	407960	you could save a life.
407960	410240	And I was like, oh, I donated a couple thousand dollars.
410240	412160	I think I saved one life.
412160	415360	That was, I followed a lot of this.
415360	419560	And now we're in a place where it's been entirely discredited
419560	421560	because it got wrapped up in crypto
421560	423080	and San Bank Manfred and AI
423080	424840	and all these really weird practices.
424840	425920	How did that happen?
425920	427320	Okay.
427320	429840	I wanna first just pause and say,
429840	431360	there are some really important things
431360	432800	that you point out here,
432800	436560	which is that giving money is absolutely better
436560	438760	as an act of trust and solidarity
438760	441880	and love for one's fellow human beings than giving stuff,
441880	445800	which is really a mode of kind of retaining control
445800	448480	and retaining a sort of paternalistic view of other people.
448480	450120	I think I know what you need.
450120	450960	Here it is.
450960	451800	Exactly.
451800	453760	If I give you money, you're gonna go spend it on drugs
453760	454600	or alcohol.
454600	455440	Yes.
455440	457960	So here's a nice tie that you can wear
457960	459680	to your office job that I think you should get
459680	460520	for whatever it is.
460520	461360	Exactly.
461360	463800	And actually the problem with effective altruism
463800	468800	starts with a similar but maybe way expanded level
469000	470480	of that kind of hubris.
470480	473200	A sense of we, the smartest people
473200	476360	with the best algorithms know best
476360	478720	how money should be used.
478720	483360	So it was never a philosophy of actual trust
483360	485480	and engagement with other people.
485480	488160	It was always a philosophy of,
488200	489800	here's a philosophical term for you,
489800	492280	epistemological hubris.
492280	496480	A real sense of we can optimize
496480	501480	and we can perfect the exact sort of quantifiable change
503200	505240	that our philanthropy is going to produce
505240	508880	and that makes us feel good in the same way
508880	511720	that a lot of philanthropy is really designed
511720	516720	to make the donor feel good, feel validated in themselves.
516760	517840	You're kind of blowing my mind
517840	519800	because the whole premise of effective altruism is,
519800	522960	oh, so many donations are just feel good,
522960	525080	but effective altruism is you point out
525080	526080	feel good in a different way
526080	528080	because you sort of have that.
528080	529080	It's almost like when you buy something
529080	530400	off the wire cutter recommendation,
530400	532040	you're like, I got the best one.
532040	534120	I feel so proud because I know I got the best one
534120	535960	and you follow the Give Well recommendation.
535960	537240	I followed all the evidence.
537240	539400	This says that this is the best donation.
539400	540880	I'm the best little boy.
540880	544720	Well, a very, like a real extension
544920	548400	of the sort of Puritan work ethic of like,
548400	553400	oh, instead of I have just have the best character
553520	556280	and now it's I was also the smartest, right?
556280	558600	So you get to, in fact, you get to have both
558600	560720	where you're like, not only am I such a good person,
560720	563400	but I'm the smartest at being a good person.
563400	567560	So there's a lot of ego wrapped up in that method
567560	572040	that ultimately I think proved itself, proved it's undoing
572080	574680	that says, okay, this was never really engaged
574680	577920	with the complexities of systems,
577920	580400	the complexities of what people on the ground
580400	581600	might say they need
581600	584200	or even the complexity of systems change.
584200	586640	In fact, if you look at the effective altruists
588920	590840	publications, they would say,
590840	593280	we're not getting involved in political change.
593280	594760	That takes too long.
594760	597120	There's no way to measure the Delta.
597120	599120	There's no way to be secure.
599120	601360	Again, going back to that kind of need
601360	605280	for validation, need for confirmation of efficacy.
605280	608760	So being part of something that might be a longer,
608760	612680	more complex, but ultimately more transformative
614480	617600	initiative for what you use your dollars for
617600	619360	was not attractive to them.
619360	622040	Cause they want, you know, effective altruists want
622040	624160	the immediate, the tangible, the concrete,
624160	627040	the quantifiable for their own gratification,
627040	627880	in my opinion.
627880	628720	Yeah.
628720	630840	Let's talk a little bit about the roots of this movement.
631560	634560	So Peter Singer, again, utilitarian philosopher,
634560	636560	sort of develops these philosophies about,
636560	640160	if you want to do the most good and you should,
640160	642720	that's sort of an ethical burden on you,
642720	645720	then you should figure out the way to save the most lives,
645720	648040	reduce the most suffering.
648040	650440	And it's purely a philosophical position,
650440	652560	but it gets picked up by what we call
652560	654000	the effective altruism movement.
654000	657240	Who are these people and where did they come from?
657280	662280	Effective altruism has a lot of purchase among tech wealth
662600	663640	on the West coast.
663640	668520	So Dustin Moskovitz, who's one of the Facebook founders,
668520	670360	he's a major, he and his wife, Kerry Tuna,
670360	672920	major funders of Give Well.
672920	677000	Now this goes to other household names, Elon Musk,
677000	681040	has jumped on the effective altruist train.
681040	683600	Peter Thiel has jumped on the effective altruism train
683600	684440	as well.
684440	685720	There's a lot of spread.
685720	688960	I'll have creep, I would say, about this philosophy,
688960	691440	but it fits in neatly with this idea
691440	694400	that the world is reducible to calculation.
694400	698800	The world is reducible to some kind of definitive,
698800	702200	like algorithmic analysis.
702200	706160	So the idea is that a problem like poverty
706160	709760	can be solved by some kind of uniquely identifiable
709760	713800	single kind of line item of what you're gonna give to people.
713800	714920	It could be bed nets.
714960	716800	It could be something else.
718120	723120	But it is this idea that somehow there's one intervention
723560	726520	that your money can do that somehow is gonna have
726520	729360	an outsize effect on people's lives.
729360	731760	There's a satisfaction in that, right?
731760	733960	I remember donating the Against Malaria Foundation,
733960	736680	which I have no reason to believe is a bad organization.
737680	741120	And you make your donation and they show you
741120	744360	a little progress update for like the dollars,
744360	747400	how many bed nets your dollars are buying
747400	749000	and where they're going
749000	751440	and how many people they're gonna protect.
751440	754880	And it feels so quantifiable and positive.
754880	757200	Malaria is a huge problem and it kills many people.
757200	760520	And I'll take it on faith
760520	762640	that the lack of bed nets is a problem.
762640	764480	And it's something that I can,
764480	765720	if I buy two more bed nets,
765720	766640	then those are two more people
766640	768720	who are gonna have access to them.
768720	773440	But it is my feeling that it's still my emotion
773800	775200	that is being triggered there.
775200	776040	Right.
776040	779360	Well, the Nobel Prize winning economist, Angus Deaton,
779360	782320	referred to the effective altruist movement as the idea
782320	783160	that lies-
783160	784000	Past guest Angus Deaton, by the way.
784000	784840	Past guest.
784840	785680	Thank you.
785680	786520	Thank you.
786520	787360	Great.
787360	788200	A colleague then.
788200	790200	Just so you know, Nobel Prize on the show before.
790200	792040	And that means one for you in the future.
792040	792880	Thank you.
792880	793720	I appreciate that.
794680	797120	So he referred to effective altruism as the idea
797120	800840	that lives can be bought cheaply, like used cars.
800840	802560	It's the idea that lives are bought,
802560	804640	you're looking for the best deal.
804640	808480	You're looking for lives that you can gain cost-effectively.
808480	809320	Yeah.
809320	811840	That feels like a kind of icky, reductive way
811840	813520	of looking at other human beings.
813520	815800	Yeah, it's like you're doing your charity like storage wars.
815800	816960	Like you're showing up going like,
816960	819040	how much can I get for,
819040	822040	oh, those lives are going for like 10 bucks each.
822040	823960	I can save a bunch of lives over there.
823960	825120	Yes.
825120	828560	And that in fact is used as an argument for,
828560	831240	hey, why would you spend your charity dollar in the US?
831240	832720	It'll go much further if you spend it overseas,
832720	833560	you'll save more lives.
833560	834400	Exactly.
834400	835640	Which is like, on the one hand,
835640	836960	the first time you hear that, you're like,
836960	839080	okay, yeah, maybe I am being, you know,
839080	843640	chauvinistic by saying, oh, people in my city are better,
843640	846560	a more important, maybe I should, all lives are equal, right?
846560	847400	Yeah.
847400	849280	But then on the other hand, after a while you start going,
849280	852000	well, why wouldn't I try to improve the place I live?
852000	852840	Right.
852840	853680	That's where I live.
853680	854520	Right.
854520	855840	It's where I live and it's where I'm actually
855840	857600	in relationship with other people.
857600	858440	Exactly.
858440	859640	In some really important way.
859640	862200	So you have a bigger chance, a better shot
862200	865920	at seeing people as full, complex human beings
865920	868400	rather than just these kind of abstract objects
868400	871960	that I refer to them in the book as like avatars of poverty.
871960	874360	There's this like flattening and objectification
874360	877080	of people that comes with giving philosophies
877080	880880	that really see people as only their vulnerability,
880880	883240	only their need, only their desperation,
883240	886320	that you then the hero donor can save
886320	889520	for just one dollar a day with just one bed net.
889520	893160	There's a real, you want to talk about chauvinism,
893160	895200	but there's a real egotistical feedback loop
895200	900200	that comes with that that has a less chance of evolution
900920	904600	than if you say, okay, I'm really focusing giving
904600	907720	in a way that keeps me in deep connected relationship
907720	910040	with other people and build some common world
910040	911240	that I want to share with them.
911240	913320	And that's what the people sort of running
913320	914600	this movement kind of lacked.
914600	919120	They weren't actually in community with anybody
919120	920920	other than themselves and the wealthy people
920920	921840	that they hung out with.
921840	924040	And that really led to some biases.
924040	928040	Like I used to read the givewell.org recommendations
928040	930960	every year and see how they would rank different things.
930960	932920	And then one year I went, well, hold on a second,
932920	934240	I'm really concerned about climate change.
934240	935600	Have they done any work on climate change?
935600	939000	And I dug into their, like they publish all their papers.
939000	940580	It's very academic and rigorous.
940580	942080	And I went and looked at the climate change
942080	943960	and they had done, you know, a couple of pages on them.
943960	945360	They were like, well, we evaluated some things,
945360	947240	but we couldn't really find proof.
947240	949100	You know, they want really rigorous evidence
949100	951940	that your dollar is going to, you know,
951940	953020	create such and such good.
953020	954340	And they're like, we couldn't really find a charity
954340	955460	that would prove that.
955460	956300	Right.
956300	958460	And I'm going, well, what do you have to?
958460	960940	Like, you know, can't, we have,
960940	962700	like that standard is really high.
962700	964700	And then I started looking at the other things
964700	967300	they were recommending and they had started to go,
967300	970660	oh, a new area of focus for us is AI mitigation.
970660	971900	We're really worried.
971900	974700	And by the way, this was like five to seven years ago.
974700	975700	They were like, we're really worried
975700	977660	that AI is going to take over the world.
977660	979580	And if we invest money right now,
979580	981540	preventing AI from taking over the world,
981540	983380	that's going to be the most valuable.
983380	986860	And I was like, who, you're not working on climate change,
986860	989780	but you are working on AI?
989780	991820	Like, what, why?
991820	992660	And-
992660	994780	Well, there's two things happening there.
994780	998940	And one is that climate change is really ill-suited
998940	1000020	to their framework.
1000020	1003020	It's complex, it's multivalent.
1003020	1005460	It's going to require lots of different kinds
1005460	1007580	of interventions, going to require social movements.
1007580	1009980	Stuff that you can't easily quantify
1009980	1012540	and it's going to happen at a much slower pace
1012540	1015820	than the kind of immediacy of like bed net equals life.
1015820	1017180	You know?
1017180	1019460	The other thing that's going on there
1019460	1024460	is that the appeal of the long-term future
1024460	1028140	because long-termism is the sort of new fad
1028140	1028980	that you're referring to.
1028980	1030700	That became their new thing of, oh, we need to think
1030700	1032980	not just five years or 10 years into the future,
1032980	1034500	but like 10,000 years.
1034500	1035340	Right.
1035820	1038980	This is sort of the end state of thinking of humanity
1038980	1040940	only in terms of volume.
1040940	1045180	Like how the number of beings that we count as human beings
1045180	1048100	who could maximally be alive
1048100	1050340	and not about quality of life,
1050340	1052740	not about quality of our world,
1052740	1054460	but really just the numbers.
1055740	1059260	I refer in the book to their philosophy
1059260	1062660	of existing human beings as depreciating assets.
1062660	1063500	Right?
1063500	1065980	If you're a human being that's alive today,
1065980	1067300	you have liabilities.
1067300	1070980	You can't, you know, immediately you can't quite maximize,
1070980	1072260	we're not ideal figures.
1072260	1073860	You can't maximize our utility.
1073860	1075300	You can't maximize our labor.
1075300	1076740	We might have sickness.
1076740	1077620	We're going to age.
1077620	1079660	Like it's like you drive a car off the lot
1079660	1082620	to extend Angus Deaton's analogy.
1082620	1086300	Like the moment a human being is alive, it has liabilities.
1086300	1090020	And so if they're looking for this perfect, optimized,
1090060	1093780	idealized human civilization
1093780	1097220	that really is about maximizing the number of human beings
1097220	1099900	that are alive and productive at any given time,
1099900	1101940	then you're going to look way into the future
1101940	1103740	when it's just a computer model.
1103740	1106180	You're not going to deal with the reality of human beings
1106180	1108860	in the here and now because it's too complex
1108860	1110860	and it's too compromised in a way.
1110860	1113700	There's also a degree to which it's taking
1113700	1115580	like a philosophical thought experiment
1115580	1116740	and taking it literally.
1116740	1119180	Like it's all well and good to write, you know,
1119180	1121220	well, hey, if I could, you know,
1121220	1125340	if you could spend $1,000 and save one life today
1125340	1127060	or you could spend $1,000
1127060	1129820	and save 10,000 lives in the future
1129820	1133620	because you are preventing AI mitigation
1133620	1135100	or you're mitigating an AI
1135100	1137140	that could potentially kill billions of people
1137140	1138900	in the future and you're blah, blah, blah, blah.
1138900	1139740	Right.
1139740	1140740	In a philosophical thought experiment,
1140740	1144140	you could have a fun time deciding which is more important.
1144140	1148340	But like as if someone who studied philosophy,
1148340	1150780	I was always like, well, you don't actually do that shit.
1150780	1151780	You know what I mean?
1151780	1153100	It's a thought experiment.
1153100	1155060	Like the Chinese room isn't real.
1155060	1157860	The lever that makes the train go from one, you know.
1157860	1159140	I hope I can say on this show
1159140	1161420	that there's something masturbatory about all of it,
1161420	1162820	you know, there is something like.
1162820	1164860	Well, philosophy is inherently masturbatory.
1164860	1165900	I couldn't agree more.
1165900	1167100	And that's the great thing about it.
1167100	1168060	I love masturbating.
1168060	1169460	Well, it's been great being on the show.
1169460	1170300	I'm glad.
1170300	1173460	But I don't, but you know,
1173460	1175660	masturbating is that's only one part of my life.
1175660	1177820	I don't take that to the rest of my social life.
1177820	1179620	I don't have to talk about pie charts, Adam.
1179620	1181100	We don't have to look at the breakdown.
1181100	1182020	It's okay.
1182020	1184340	Let's move off of this metaphor.
1184340	1187740	But yeah, there's an oddness to taking it.
1187740	1189740	Even taking utilitarianism, which again,
1189740	1191940	I think is a philosophy with a lot to recommend it.
1191940	1193860	I'm not like some Peter Singer hater,
1193860	1195380	but it is the kind of thing
1195380	1197740	where when you actually take it really seriously,
1197740	1199580	you're like, well.
1199580	1203180	The big problem with effective altruism is its absolutism.
1203180	1205660	The fact that there's really very little room
1205660	1209540	for alternative ways of thinking.
1209540	1213420	And to me, that's symptomatic of a bigger problem,
1213420	1216860	which is that under our current kind of,
1216860	1218780	yeah, can I use the term neoliberal here?
1218780	1220060	Can we talk about neoliberalism?
1220060	1220900	Fantastic.
1220900	1224300	So under neoliberalism, which is the kind of philosophy
1224300	1227540	that we really need to be competitive in the market
1227540	1229860	as much as possible, that our whole lives need to be
1229860	1233340	kind of oriented towards our performance
1233340	1235020	in the economic market.
1235020	1236900	It means that that takes over our lives
1236900	1239100	to the exclusion of all other ways
1239100	1241660	of relating to ourselves and to other people.
1241660	1245020	And effective altruism is this kind of consummate example
1245020	1247700	of that taking over philanthropy of saying,
1247700	1250340	well, human beings are really just,
1251780	1254500	the metric that we use to judge worth
1254500	1257380	is whether we're alive and economically productive.
1257380	1259620	And that's the mode by which we decide
1259620	1261660	where our charitable dollars go.
1261660	1264500	And that excludes so many other dimensions
1264500	1268540	of human life and things that make life worth living
1268540	1271020	and actually make us human.
1271020	1274420	Well, how did effective altruism get involved
1274420	1276940	with crypto and with Sam Bankman Freed?
1276940	1279940	Because this is the oddest part of the story, I think.
1279940	1280780	Right.
1280780	1283620	Well, I'm not a journalist with expertise
1283620	1285380	on the kind of chronology of that,
1285380	1290380	but I can say that early effective altruism
1290380	1295380	was popular among a kind of class of young bankers
1295940	1300300	who signed onto this idea of earning to give, right?
1300300	1302580	This was part of the philosophy was like,
1302580	1305220	oh, instead of going to work for a nonprofit
1305220	1307260	where there's gonna be limits,
1307260	1311700	constraints on how much good I can personally contribute,
1311700	1314780	the idea is, oh, if I go make a ton of money
1314780	1317020	working in banking, working in a hedge fund
1317020	1319780	and I give it away to the most effective charities,
1319820	1322780	then I'll be doing so much more good.
1322780	1324420	I don't wanna pause and just say,
1324420	1327940	notice how much the I figures in to all of this.
1327940	1331180	Notice how much this is about the sovereign self,
1331180	1334700	the sovereign control, I as the sort of actor in history.
1334700	1338020	And there's a missing parentheses in that little story,
1338020	1341580	which is also in the second version, I'll be fucking rich.
1341580	1342420	Of course.
1342420	1343260	Right.
1343260	1345900	I'll have a private jet and a penthouse.
1345900	1348940	Or, and like, at any time,
1348940	1351940	I can just keep more of the money if it works for me.
1351940	1354060	Like even if you start off saying,
1354060	1356420	okay, I'm gonna live a monkish existence
1356420	1358940	and donate my seven figure bonuses
1358940	1361300	to effective altruist ranked charities, that's fine.
1361300	1363860	But at any given time, you can still choose to pull back
1363860	1364700	and say, you know what,
1364700	1366460	I actually would like some of this money for myself.
1366460	1369660	I feel like I've accumulated enough virtue points
1369660	1370500	in the world.
1370500	1371340	Yeah.
1371340	1374740	Versus actually working in service of other people.
1374740	1375580	Right.
1375580	1379100	And since take a $70,000 a year a job as a social worker,
1379100	1381060	which would be a great salary for a social worker,
1381060	1383940	and actually work in service of others,
1383940	1386620	now your needs are less prioritized.
1386620	1387940	Your needs are less prioritized
1387940	1390340	and you just don't have as much control.
1390340	1391180	You don't have as much,
1391180	1393180	you're working in with other people as well
1393180	1394260	and within the system.
1394260	1398980	So there's this undercurrent of maximizing the amount
1398980	1402260	of control that you, the donor have,
1402300	1406060	even if you are allegedly doing it all for humanity.
1406060	1407980	So there's this whole cohort of bankers
1407980	1409500	who are signing on this philosophy.
1409500	1410340	Right.
1410340	1413860	There's a story in the book about a guy named Matt Wage,
1413860	1415340	who was a student of Peter Singers
1415340	1419100	and this is a early description of this philosophy.
1419100	1423500	He says, imagine if you walk past a burning building
1423500	1428500	and you could save all 100 people who were inside.
1428940	1431420	Like you had a way of like putting out the fire
1431460	1433860	or you could kick down the door and save 100 people,
1433860	1437180	that would be the greatest day of your life.
1437180	1441660	And you're like the greatest day of your life.
1441660	1443980	Ha, ha, ha, ha.
1443980	1446300	Everybody else inside had a pretty shini day.
1446300	1447140	Right.
1447140	1448780	Also especially cause there was one guy
1448780	1449860	trying to save all of them
1449860	1452420	instead of an entire firefighting system.
1452420	1453660	And also they're building burned down
1453660	1458660	because of poor safety codes and maybe the building inspector
1458660	1461540	You know, the building inspector had been, you know,
1461540	1462900	defunded the previous year
1462900	1465940	because there had been some tax cuts across the city.
1465940	1468220	So that the, you know, so the hero guy walking around.
1468220	1469780	A city that now is like,
1469780	1472300	you, the hedge fund you work for holds a bond
1472300	1475100	against that debt, by the way, right?
1475100	1476420	So, yes.
1476420	1477580	Those people didn't have great days,
1477580	1479780	but the hero who rescued everybody.
1479780	1481500	You at the best day, right?
1481500	1486500	So, I think you can draw a line from that mentality
1487500	1491060	to a Sam Bankman freed who says,
1491060	1494420	aha, like here is a movement Taylor made for me,
1494420	1498900	a guy who thinks he is the smartest and the most effective
1498900	1502180	and really doesn't have to answer to anybody else
1502180	1503220	as we found out.
1503220	1505580	He really didn't think he did.
1505580	1510580	So there was a, there's a sort of through line of justification
1510740	1514420	of accumulating wealth by any means
1514420	1516820	because you're going to put it to, as you put it,
1516820	1518540	the right ends.
1518540	1521060	So that's how we end up with a Sam Bankman freed.
1521060	1524060	And he became completely entwined
1524060	1525900	in the effective altruism movement.
1525900	1528060	My understanding is a huge amount,
1528060	1531020	money started flooding into this movement.
1531020	1534060	The New Yorker did a wonderful piece on this.
1534060	1536340	You know, they started buying buildings or whatever
1536340	1537900	and like, you know, having all this space
1537900	1539660	and you know, yada, yada, yada.
1539660	1542140	And a lot of that money was coming from Sam Bankman freed
1542140	1544100	and other crypto people.
1544100	1547340	And now that he is about, as we speak right now,
1547340	1549260	about to go to prison for a very long time
1549260	1552060	because he was convicted of one of the most massive
1552060	1554460	financial frauds in American history,
1554460	1557860	it's discredited the movement because the,
1557860	1559980	like the leading lights of this movement,
1559980	1563500	the philosopher kings who were writing the papers
1563500	1568020	and spreading the good word were like best buddies with him,
1568020	1571300	one of the most unethical people in the history of the country.
1571300	1573140	Why? Because he had the money.
1573740	1577740	The entire board of the FTX Foundation resigned
1577740	1582740	and wrote an open letter once the indictments came for Sam.
1583140	1586220	And there were a number of responses that basically said,
1586220	1588900	how could you like, you guys have PhDs from Oxford,
1588900	1590820	like how could you have worked with this guy
1590820	1593540	and had a foundation that was allegedly
1593540	1596940	going to give out a hundred million dollars a year, right?
1596940	1601060	And you know, buy into all of this hype
1602060	1605460	without really checking the reality.
1605460	1607900	Yeah, they were going to give out a hundred million dollars
1607900	1612500	a year to save lives and the future of humanity, yada, yada.
1612500	1615580	But that was money that they got because they just stole it.
1615580	1620100	They stole it from other people who were told, like, disappear.
1620100	1622500	But you misunderstand, those people were dumber.
1625100	1626220	They were just dumber.
1626220	1628860	They were dumb enough to believe what we told them,
1628980	1631460	which is that FTX and all that was a great investment.
1631460	1632740	Exactly.
1632740	1634940	So clearly they would not have been better.
1634940	1637740	They were not worthy stewards of this money.
1637740	1641540	The way we, the people stealing it from them, would have been.
1641540	1643780	One of the things I find most fascinating about this
1643780	1646980	is that it's a really rare example
1646980	1650460	of a philosophical idea or a philosophical movement
1650460	1652660	starting with Peter Singer and the utilitarians
1652660	1655020	that is now discredited.
1655020	1657380	I have to think that there's been some backlash
1657380	1660060	in the Philosophical Academy about this
1660060	1662900	because of its association with the real world.
1662900	1666580	It's rare for a philosophical idea
1666580	1668940	to interact with the real world so badly
1668940	1670140	that it becomes discredited.
1670140	1671820	That seems to have happened here, at least to me.
1671820	1674380	It has, and it's happened quickly, right?
1674380	1676340	It's happened in this very compressed timeframe
1676340	1679300	where you have this rise of trend of effective altruism,
1679300	1681340	like you say New Yorker profiles,
1681340	1684340	major public figures coming into view.
1685100	1687460	Not typical to have a giving philosophy
1687460	1690420	becoming such a zeitgeisty thing.
1691420	1693980	And then you have this scandal that happened
1693980	1696420	so quickly and so dramatically.
1696420	1699060	And I think what it proved is the flaws
1699060	1701380	that were baked into the philosophical model
1701380	1703180	immediately proved true,
1703180	1705540	like the moment it started to interact with,
1705540	1709580	I don't think in a way it's surprising that this happened
1709580	1713460	because this is just the inevitable product
1713460	1715700	of a philosophy that says we can do the most good
1715700	1717580	in the world without actually really caring
1717580	1720460	about other people and our obligations to them.
1720460	1721420	Yeah, it's really interesting.
1721420	1724020	Cause again, utilitarianism is not something
1724020	1727260	I throw out by itself, but the knock against it
1727260	1729820	is always that it leads to sort of perverse outcomes
1729820	1731540	if you actually follow through on it.
1731540	1734220	And holy shit, it happened immediately.
1734220	1735540	Right.
1735540	1737900	Who could have predicted everyone?
1737900	1739660	It do be like that.
1739660	1741620	It do be like that.
1742340	1744060	Honestly, I'd love to have Peter Singer on this show
1744060	1745860	because I still think he's a fascinating thinker.
1745860	1746780	Absolutely.
1746780	1748780	And I'd love to hear how he interacts
1748780	1750340	with some of what happened since,
1750340	1751940	but you know what, let's take a really quick break
1751940	1754140	cause I want to talk to you when we get back
1754140	1757580	about other streams of philanthropic thought
1757580	1758580	and mistakes that have been made
1758580	1762340	and how we can actually maybe help each other
1762340	1763540	in a more productive way.
1763540	1765900	But we'll be right back with more Amy Shiller.
1765900	1767420	You know, the year is never more hectic
1767420	1768700	than during the holiday season
1768700	1770980	with travel plans, work projects wrapping up.
1770980	1772020	And if you're on a household,
1772020	1774140	it's sometimes even hard to remember what's for dinner
1774140	1776300	or if anyone is remembered to feed the dog.
1776300	1777540	If this sounds like your home
1777540	1778900	or the home of someone you know,
1778900	1781700	this holiday season is time for the gift of organization
1781700	1783300	with the skylight calendar.
1783300	1785780	The skylight calendar is a smart touchscreen calendar
1785780	1788700	and organizer for all your chores, groceries and to-dos.
1788700	1791220	It automatically syncs all the different digital calendars
1791220	1792500	and events your family uses
1792500	1793860	and shows them all together
1793860	1796300	on one beautiful touchscreen display.
1796300	1797940	Skylight calendar is the best way
1797940	1799540	to give your family peace of mind
1799540	1801660	to enjoy the things that matter most.
1801660	1803100	It works by syncing events
1803100	1805180	from already existing calendars you have,
1805180	1807500	including Google, Outlook and Apple calendars.
1807500	1810340	You can also add events directly using the touchscreen
1810340	1812500	or with the free skylight mobile app.
1812500	1815380	It shows all family events together in one spot
1815380	1818540	so you can see what everyone has going on each week.
1818540	1820460	Families are more likely to actually check it
1820460	1821580	since it's always up to date
1821580	1823860	so they don't question mom every day about schedules.
1823860	1825940	And it also comes in two sizes,
1825940	1828300	small 10 inch or large 15 inch.
1828300	1830060	The large one is wall-mountable
1830060	1832180	and looks beautiful up on the wall.
1832180	1833140	And on top of that,
1833140	1835460	there are multiple view options to choose from,
1835460	1837020	day, week or month views,
1837020	1838820	or you can set it to schedule view
1838820	1840180	to see a few days at a time
1840180	1842660	formatted in hour by hour blocks.
1842660	1845940	And as a special limited time offer for our listeners,

2016740	2019300	and traded online by data brokers.
2019300	2021540	But that doesn't mean you can't stay private

2045260	2047940	About 41% of Americans are exposed
2047940	2049740	to some form of online harassment.
2049740	2051060	And let me tell you something
2051060	2052940	as a public figure on the internet,
2052940	2054700	that's something that I deal with myself.
2054700	2057460	And that is why I have been a subscriber
2057460	2058980	to Delete Me for years.
2058980	2061500	Years before they even sponsored this podcast,
2061500	2063220	I just used their service.
2063220	2065820	In fact, I signed up my entire family for it
2065820	2068420	because I didn't want any of our names, addresses,
2068420	2071380	phone numbers, any of that personal information online
2071380	2073820	where people can just get it whenever they want.
2073820	2076540	I wanted to keep myself safe and all of us safe.
2076540	2077660	And let me tell you something,
2077660	2080540	Delete Me has done a fantastic job of that for me.
2080540	2082740	So if you wanna safeguard yourself
2082740	2084180	and live with a peace of mind

2102540	2103900	Okay, we are back with Amy Schiller
2103900	2107380	talking about philanthropy and all of its problems.
2107380	2108500	And solutions.
2108500	2110340	And solutions, we're gonna talk about solutions too,
2110340	2111380	but I wanna talk about one more problem first.
2111380	2112300	Yes, let's.
2112300	2113500	We just talked about the philosophy
2113500	2115100	of effective of altruism.
2115100	2117420	I've covered recently on my YouTube channel,
2117420	2119060	billionaire philanthropy.
2119060	2121420	People like Bill Gates, Warren Buffett,
2121420	2123380	Andrew Carnegie going back into history,
2123380	2125540	this idea that billionaires can save the world
2125540	2127060	by donating all of their money.
2128020	2129460	And people can go watch that video
2129460	2133340	if they wanna sort of see the full version of that debunking
2133340	2134420	and my thoughts on it.
2134420	2136540	But I wanna ask you about a specific example of it
2136540	2139540	that's often presented as being a positive
2139540	2141260	because I know you covered in the book.
2141260	2146260	Mackenzie Scott, who is Jeff Bezos' ex-wife.
2146460	2147300	I was gonna say widow.
2147300	2148900	He's not dead, we can hope.
2149900	2154460	His ex-wife, she received billions in the divorce,
2154460	2157060	and she has been giving the money away like crazy.
2157060	2159580	And people will often say in the comments of my videos,
2159580	2161700	I'm Mackenzie Scott, now she's a great example.
2161700	2163660	She's a good example of this
2163660	2165940	because she's just trying to get rid of this shit.
2165940	2168180	I'm curious what your take is on her.
2168180	2171020	Well, it's very like, you're right, you're also right.
2171020	2172860	A very kind of fiddler on the roof approach
2172860	2174380	where it's like, you're right,
2174380	2178100	she is doing it better than any billionaire, right?
2178100	2179340	She's giving her money away
2179340	2182220	in really admirable transformative ways.
2182220	2184700	And what makes it better than how they give it away?
2184700	2187140	She gives it away unrestricted.
2187140	2189340	That's the number one thing.
2189340	2190660	And I'll get back to that in a second,
2190660	2195660	but the thing is that she is doing her philanthropy
2195660	2198660	I think better than others, but because of that,
2198700	2202260	you can see the limits of philanthropy's actual power
2202260	2204060	to create social change.
2204060	2206580	So I'll explain why.
2206580	2209740	So Mackenzie Scott gives away
2209740	2211980	tens of millions of dollars in tranches
2211980	2214780	and she works with a team of consultants
2214780	2217420	and they do a lot of vetting behind the scenes.
2217420	2220820	And so unlike many situations where nonprofits
2220820	2223060	have to write grant reports
2223060	2225980	and massage all their language to fit a funder's,
2225980	2228340	oh, we're really interested in this particular thing
2228340	2230620	or can you make this about dogs somehow?
2230620	2232220	There's like so much.
2232220	2233620	I wanna build it with my name on it.
2233620	2235100	Can I have a nice building?
2235100	2239020	There's so much catering to the idiosyncratic preferences
2239020	2240980	of funders and it takes up a ton of time
2240980	2242700	and then you have to do reporting that shows like,
2242700	2245140	oh, we spent the money on exactly the thing
2245140	2247100	that we said we were gonna spend it on
2247100	2251060	to, I think, very burdensome degrees, right?
2251060	2252220	There's certainly a case to be made
2252220	2253260	that you should do some of that,
2253260	2254740	but this is very burdensome.
2254740	2257140	Many nonprofits complain about this.
2257140	2258660	So Mackenzie Scott instead,
2258660	2262420	what she does is she just makes up her list with her team.
2264340	2267340	Her team then calls the recipients and says,
2267340	2270860	you've just been allocated some millions of dollars
2270860	2274980	from Mackenzie Scott, unrestricted, very little reporting.
2274980	2277380	Like you just got this giant windfall
2277380	2279260	and you don't have to jump through all the hoops
2279260	2282300	that you normally have to jump through to get funding.
2282300	2283980	This is super transformative
2283980	2288860	because what this does is displaces the stature
2288860	2292220	and the power of Mackenzie as the donor
2292220	2295140	and really says this is about just getting money to people
2295140	2297020	and to go back to our theme of trust,
2297020	2299220	trusting these institutions to use it
2299220	2300660	in the way that they see fit.
2300660	2303140	So there's a lot of giving away, not just of money,
2303140	2305460	but of oversight and discretion,
2305460	2307300	which is really a form of power.
2307300	2309380	I think that's super admirable
2309380	2311940	and I think that many people should be taking her example
2311940	2315580	and not putting nonprofits through all of these paces
2315580	2316860	to try and get all this money.
2316860	2318260	And this is similar to when we were talking
2318260	2320180	at the beginning of giving someone,
2320180	2322540	hey, here's money, you know what to do best with it.
2322540	2323660	I'm not worried that you're gonna spend it
2323660	2325420	on the wrong thing, like alcohol.
2325420	2327900	It's very similar to donating to an individual person.
2327900	2329380	It gives them that trust
2329380	2331220	and it deprioritizes you, the giver.
2331220	2332060	That's good.
2332060	2334700	Exactly, I think that's the best thing.
2334700	2337140	Where I think you see the limits is,
2337140	2339500	Mackenzie Scott has made many public statements
2339500	2341620	where she talks about her concerns
2341620	2345340	about social and economic justice, racial injustice,
2345340	2347140	that she wants this money to go,
2347140	2351060	not to elite institutions, but to HBCUs, for example,
2351060	2354500	or she wants it to go to local social service organizations,
2354500	2358420	things that are not priorities for the billionaire class.
2358420	2360380	These are really gifts that she's making
2360380	2364180	to organizations that serve poor,
2364180	2366580	working and otherwise disenfranchised people
2366580	2367660	in the United States.
2367700	2371180	That's also great and great and unusual.
2371180	2374780	The only problem is that for all of the money
2374780	2376100	that she has and all the money
2376100	2378300	that she's shoveling out the door,
2378300	2381260	the metaphor I use in the book is Lucy and Ethel
2381260	2382980	at the chocolate factory.
2382980	2385260	It's like they can't wrap the chocolate fast enough
2385260	2388260	to get it out the door like she desperately wants to.
2388260	2390820	Unfortunately, her holdings of Amazon stock
2390820	2392620	mean that she's just gonna keep accumulating money
2392620	2394500	even faster than she can give it away.
2394500	2395740	Wow.
2395740	2397340	So that's one problem.
2397340	2398180	Interesting.
2398180	2399980	So she hasn't divested from the Amazon stock.
2399980	2403580	She still has, the money is growing, what?
2403580	2405660	Because Amazon stock price can be used, right?
2405660	2407300	Now, this is as far as I know.
2407300	2409620	Like I can't say I know the contents of her portfolio,
2409620	2411740	but if we assume that it's from Amazon stock,
2411740	2416420	then yes, her wealth is just growing at a faster rate
2416420	2419780	than she could give it away even at this revolutionary pace.
2419780	2421420	But she could give it away.
2421420	2423620	I mean, it's possible to divest,
2423620	2426180	but she's sort of still using an endowment sort of model
2426180	2429580	where she has a big pot and then the proceeds
2429580	2431580	from the investment is what is being given away.
2431580	2433540	So her metaphor is she wants to give
2433540	2435140	until the safe is empty.
2435140	2436620	Now the problem with the safe is that
2436620	2438780	there's like a static amount of money in there.
2438780	2440500	It's not like, oh, it gets refilled
2440500	2443300	and then you have to like continuously empty it.
2443300	2446660	But there's a different strain of issue here,
2446660	2448260	which is that she could,
2448260	2452060	she could of course officially divest herself of her stock
2452060	2454420	or she could put a billion dollars
2454420	2456900	into the Amazon Worker Strike Fund.
2456900	2458380	She could use this money,
2458380	2460860	not in these kind of downstream palliative ways
2460860	2462220	where she gives it to nonprofits
2462220	2466620	that are trying to kind of make up for the deprivations
2466620	2469260	that people face in a deeply unequal society.
2469260	2471140	She could do something much more radical
2471140	2473780	and confrontational with the amount of money that she has
2473780	2476620	that would actually change labor relations,
2476620	2478340	that would actually change policy,
2478340	2480460	that might actually do something to prevent
2480460	2483380	these conditions of inequality that so concern her.
2483380	2485260	So this model of charitable giving
2485260	2488060	as a mode of social justice,
2488060	2491300	it kind of comes too late in the process.
2491300	2493900	You would have to intervene upstream
2493900	2497500	in our political system in a more confrontational way.
2497500	2500140	So I think as chaired, as philanthropy, it's great,
2500140	2502580	but as social justice, I think it's very limited.
2502580	2504180	So, okay, that's really interesting
2504180	2505340	because she's giving away the money
2505340	2506940	in a way that deprioritizes her.
2506940	2508740	But it sounds like what you're saying is the choices
2508740	2512540	that she's making her priorities of who gets the money,
2512580	2514660	it's still her team figuring it out,
2514660	2518460	she still has some biases or some things
2518460	2520060	she maybe doesn't quite understand.
2520060	2523500	Maybe just, I would say some limitations, right?
2523500	2526340	Like there's, I would love to see her go farther.
2526340	2531340	I would love to see her become a champion of workers rights
2532140	2536060	that would be much more revolutionary, much more radical,
2536060	2537820	and it wouldn't just be redistributing money,
2537820	2540620	it would be genuinely redistributing power.
2540620	2543900	So let's talk about what kind of donation that would be.
2543900	2547780	I mean, if one were to actually donate money
2547780	2549100	to a place that would actually do these things,
2549100	2551540	what sort of organizations are we talking about?
2551540	2554420	So if we're talking about nonprofits,
2554420	2557660	there are some excellent advocacy nonprofits.
2557660	2560020	There's Americans for financial reform,
2560020	2563020	there's demand progress, there's the revolving door project.
2563020	2566220	There are a number of nonprofits that really seek to
2566220	2569580	weaken the power of corporations in government.
2569580	2572060	And again, I have to echo donating money
2572060	2574340	to union strike funds would be an incredibly
2574340	2576420	ballsy and revolutionary move.
2576420	2579180	That would really be about giving workers the power
2579180	2581380	to negotiate for their own conditions.
2581380	2582860	Frankly, you could probably just give money
2582860	2585140	to union networks more broadly.
2585140	2587740	They all have operating foundations as well.
2587740	2591100	So there's some confrontational giving
2591100	2595220	that is right on the line between charitable giving,
2595220	2597980	501c3 and a form of like political giving.
2597980	2599860	You might even give it to a 501c4
2599860	2601380	that more actively does lobbying.
2601380	2604180	So that's one way to do it,
2604180	2606260	where you would actually be giving to places
2606260	2610380	that are challenging our policies and our norms
2610380	2613740	and our dynamics of labor and race and power.
2613740	2617700	And not just from a kind of marginal position,
2617700	2620420	but really confrontationally in the halls of power.
2620420	2622460	But there's still a problem there.
2622460	2625300	Cause I imagine, I take your point very well.
2625300	2628380	And as a member of two unions,
2628380	2632100	one of which SAG-AFTRA did not have the strike fund
2632100	2636180	set up as year round as the Writers Guild does
2636180	2637940	and needed a lot of donations very quickly
2637940	2639180	for that strike fund.
2639180	2642620	If they were to suddenly have, hey, we're on strike.
2642620	2643460	Well, guess what?
2643460	2646220	Here's $500 million or whatever from Mackenzie Scott.
2646220	2649740	That would have changed the strike enormously.
2649740	2651980	It would have meant that actors could have,
2651980	2653860	and by the way we're talking today,
2653860	2656700	the day after the strike was resolved and ended.
2656700	2657780	And congratulations on that.
2657780	2658620	Thank you very much.
2658620	2660540	I know you're very active on that board.
2660540	2662340	Yeah, I'm active in the Writers Guild.
2662340	2664780	I'm just a SAG-AFTRA member.
2664780	2666580	But I'm an active member,
2666580	2668700	but I don't serve in any leadership role.
2668700	2673700	But if there was a strike fund that was 10 times
2673900	2675820	what it had been,
2675820	2677700	the membership would have been in a very different place.
2677700	2679700	Maybe it could have held out even longer if necessary.
2679700	2680940	I mean, hopefully not,
2680940	2684300	but it would have changed the facts on the ground.
2684300	2686100	It would have given the workers a lot more power.
2686100	2687500	So I take that point,
2687500	2691020	but I do wonder if she did have those priorities.
2691020	2696020	If she said Mackenzie Scott divorces Jeff Bezos,
2696540	2700180	and she reads a bunch of Jane McAleavy books
2700180	2702980	and the Communist Manifesto
2702980	2706380	and realizes that worker power is the most important thing
2706380	2709940	and she wants to donate to those structural places, right?
2709940	2711420	I could see someone making the argument.
2711420	2714700	Well, now she's following her other set
2714700	2717140	of ideological commitments and biases,
2717140	2720900	which are still a fact about her, right?
2720900	2722580	And maybe there's something even more efficient
2722580	2723420	she could have done.
2723420	2725140	Like, isn't part of the problem
2725140	2729620	that one person is calling the shots at all,
2729620	2732000	isn't, wouldn't it be better just to like,
2732900	2735780	take the money away and let us vote on it?
2735780	2736620	You know what I mean?
2736620	2737740	Or something like that.
2737740	2740940	Of course, that, yes,
2740940	2744820	expropriating wealth for public use is a huge part of this.
2744820	2748800	I think I'm thinking about what is in the short
2748800	2750700	to medium horizon of possible.
2750700	2751540	Yeah, of course.
2751540	2754140	So I totally take your point and agree with you.
2754140	2756900	And there's stuff in the book about how we change
2756900	2760380	tax incentives and how we change our political economy
2761260	2762420	for a number of reasons,
2762420	2763960	but one being so that philanthropy
2763960	2765900	is not this highly stratified activity
2765900	2768060	that's only done by the mega rich,
2768060	2771460	but that we have greater equality
2771460	2772780	and democratization of wealth,
2772780	2775740	such that we have democratization of giving as well.
2776620	2778380	So I completely agree with you.
2778380	2781860	That's really interesting, democratization of giving.
2781860	2783380	So expand on that, please.
2783380	2786020	So democratization of wealth really means
2786020	2789220	a more equitable distribution of wealth.
2789220	2791420	And democratization of giving would then mean
2791420	2793380	more people had the discretionary income
2793380	2797260	that they could participate even in small ways in giving.
2797260	2799980	So one of the concepts that I put forth in the book
2799980	2804980	is the idea of going beyond a living wage to a giving wage.
2805260	2808500	So we have this idea of a living wage that would pay people.
2808500	2810580	So apparently we need a special term to say
2810580	2812780	workers are actually supposed to be able to live on
2812780	2813700	what they earn.
2813700	2816740	This is like already a paradigm change
2816740	2820380	that we shouldn't need to have, but we're working on it.
2820380	2822980	I suggest that we need to go even further
2822980	2825020	and say people should be paid a giving wage.
2825020	2826740	They should be paid enough
2826740	2830060	that they can also afford even nominally to give back.
2830060	2832340	So we're recording this a couple of weeks
2832340	2834380	before Giving Tuesday, for example,
2834380	2836020	like this day after Thanksgiving,
2836020	2839060	which is one of the largest days of giving in the year,
2839060	2840500	right before giving season starts,
2840500	2842820	30% of all gifts are made in December.
2842820	2847100	So my sense is giving is really one expression
2847100	2848900	of the health of our democracy.
2848900	2852100	And so I would wanna see people paid more
2853180	2858180	and with more robust social welfare policies
2858220	2860860	that enable us all the security and the freedom
2860860	2863460	to give to things that actually enable human flourishing
2863460	2864660	in our communities.
2864660	2866860	Yeah, if we were,
2866860	2869900	if we had a more equitable economy overall,
2869900	2872500	then more people would be able to donate
2872500	2874900	and we wouldn't have the equity problems
2874900	2876420	that we do with philanthropy
2876420	2879460	because it would be overall more democratic.
2879460	2882420	And actually the labor movement
2882460	2883820	is maybe a good example of this
2883820	2887420	because folks who have union jobs generally,
2887420	2890300	on average earn more than folks who do not.
2890300	2893060	And part of a small percentage,
2893060	2895460	I forget what my total dues are,
2895460	2899900	a percent or so of my salary goes to the union,
2899900	2904900	which is a not for profit that works for the benefit
2905300	2908700	of me and others in my industry and community.
2908700	2910180	It's not quite a charity,
2910180	2911620	but it's sort of an example of this
2911620	2916620	where the labor movement is this durable nonprofit
2916900	2921260	power center for workers' rights and for equality
2921260	2925100	and generally green things
2925100	2926980	and all the good things that we like.
2926980	2931100	And it is funded by the fact that the workers,
2931100	2932940	the workers each chipping in a little bit,
2932940	2934740	which they're able to do because they're all paid more.
2934740	2935860	Exactly.
2935860	2938340	And to expand,
2938340	2941060	yes, the unions are a crucial example of this.
2941060	2944540	And then there are parts of our lives
2944540	2946420	that really secure our quality of life.
2946420	2947700	They might be our parks,
2947700	2949540	they might be cultural institutions,
2949540	2951820	they might be houses of worship,
2951820	2953860	they might be recreation centers.
2953860	2957660	Like if we think about those as power centers as well,
2957660	2960820	places that really affirm human worth
2960820	2962620	beyond our economic productivity,
2962620	2966020	places that really cultivate human community and connection,
2966020	2967740	that is a form of building power.
2967780	2971540	That is a form of affirming human value and human worth
2971540	2974820	beyond our economic productivity.
2974820	2976060	Yeah, is it?
2976060	2977860	I gotta say though, you mentioned churches, right?
2977860	2981700	And churches are probably the most common form
2981700	2984100	of community-based philanthropy.
2984100	2985940	Many, many Americans are members of churches.
2985940	2989540	Many churches have an ideology of you should chip in a bit.
2989540	2991980	And some religions or some denominations,
2991980	2995380	that's tithing where people donate a lot of their income.
2995380	2996380	And I have to say,
2996380	2998820	not all those churches are institutions
2998820	3001420	that spend money in ways that benefit society.
3001420	3003060	Some of them spend money in ways that benefit
3003060	3004460	only the people who go to the church,
3004460	3005660	that protect wealth,
3005660	3009420	that there are some very regressive churches out there.
3009420	3012660	And so I'm wondering if our desire
3012660	3014980	to have a version of philanthropy
3014980	3019340	that is going to be good in every respect is a problem.
3019340	3021500	I mean, I said a second ago, right?
3021500	3022820	What if we just take the money away
3022820	3024900	and we all vote on what to do with it, right?
3024900	3027140	And it's very easy for me to say.
3027140	3028860	Ha, ha, ha, fuck the billionaires, take the money away,
3028860	3030980	let's all vote, let's have it be democratic.
3030980	3033020	Unfortunately, we do currently have a system
3033020	3035180	where we do that to some extent, it's called taxes.
3035180	3037580	And I think if any single person in the country
3037580	3040060	were to look at what taxes are spent on,
3040060	3041780	every single person in the country would say,
3041780	3043820	I fucking hate a lot of this, right?
3043820	3047060	And that's because democracy is a fucking mess.
3047060	3048460	And people do not agree,
3048460	3050860	and there's a lot of assholes in every society,
3050860	3053020	and there's power imbalances in society,
3053020	3055060	and there's hierarchies, and there's,
3055060	3057060	people, corporations are able to say,
3057060	3058660	oh, hold on, there's a lot of money being given out,
3058660	3059780	why don't we get some for ourselves?
3059780	3062580	We're powerful enough that we can,
3062580	3065940	military industrial complex and all that shit, right?
3065940	3070940	And it sort of seems like in order to find that path
3071940	3073820	to a positive philanthropy,
3073820	3077940	we need to solve every power-based problem in society,
3077940	3080100	which seems like a tall order.
3080100	3081300	When you put it that way.
3082300	3083220	I'm very sorry,
3083220	3085540	do you have an answer to this question in your book?
3085540	3087740	It's called how to fix philanthropy,
3087740	3089460	how to fix everything.
3089460	3094460	But I guess to me, I see having this diversified set
3094460	3097580	of tactics of how we can use money for social good
3097580	3100860	kind of offsets some of the challenges
3100860	3102060	that you just listed.
3102060	3105780	So there's a story in the book that points out exactly
3105780	3106660	what you said that like,
3106660	3109100	even our democratically elected governments
3109300	3111820	are not always going to have the interests
3111820	3114020	of human flourishing at heart, right?
3114020	3115780	They might be hostile.
3115780	3119540	And so, you know, as much as the leftist in me is concerned
3119540	3122020	that what I'm saying is, you know,
3122020	3125340	a libertarian or otherwise mistrustful of government,
3125340	3128700	I do think there's something to be said for pluralism.
3128700	3132060	So the story is that in the late 90s,
3132060	3134420	Rudy Giuliani, the then mayor of New York,
3134420	3138940	wanted to sell off about 140 plots of land
3138980	3142340	that were allocated for community gardens.
3142340	3144220	And he wanted to sell them to developers
3144220	3146540	and his argument was somehow like, we need this land,
3146540	3147700	we need it for housing.
3147700	3152700	These gardens are just, you know, these elite spaces
3153500	3155820	that are just kind of draining public resources.
3155820	3157060	And really what he meant was,
3157060	3158660	this is not economically productive.
3158660	3159580	This is not right.
3159580	3161100	So.
3161100	3163100	And these sort of spaces, by the way,
3163100	3164740	are one of the things that make New York City
3164740	3166180	a wonderful city that it is,
3166180	3168860	this is a city where we're recording in New York right now,
3168860	3171100	you walk around like, oh, there's a tiny little park.
3171100	3173020	It's just like the size of one little building.
3173020	3174140	At some point they knocked down a building
3174140	3175020	and built a little park there.
3175020	3177780	And it's one of the beautiful things.
3177780	3178980	Not only did they knock down a building,
3178980	3182620	but it was actually largely black and Latinx communities
3182620	3185300	that took over vacant lots in the 1970s
3185300	3186860	and turned them into these gardens.
3186860	3189580	So they're actually our legacies of, you know,
3189580	3192300	people of color and grassroots reclaiming
3192300	3194340	of public space and building their communities.
3194340	3199020	So what the short version of what saved these spaces
3199020	3203420	is a fundraising campaign spearheaded by Bette Midler
3203420	3207300	that for $2.4 million bought these plots
3207300	3209380	and then donated them to a land trust,
3209380	3211620	donated them to New York City land trust.
3211620	3214140	So there's this way in which philanthropy
3214140	3219140	can be this lever of using money for like humanism
3219820	3224820	even in the undesirable moments
3225060	3226980	when our governments do not have that
3226980	3228700	in their core interests.
3228700	3232340	So you actually feel that philanthropy
3232340	3235100	is not by itself bad.
3235100	3238740	It's the way we've been going about it.
3238740	3240940	It's the over prioritization
3240940	3244700	and that there is a version of philanthropy
3244700	3246540	that would be productive.
3246580	3250300	There is a thing that Warren Buffett could do
3250300	3252620	that would be net positive.
3252620	3256540	So the best story I can give you to exemplify this,
3256540	3257660	it's the last part of the book
3257660	3259740	and it's a profile of LeBron James.
3259740	3263180	So LeBron has a network of institutions
3263180	3267220	that his foundation has helped start in Akron, Ohio.
3267220	3270740	And the first of them is the I Promise School.
3270740	3273540	And I wanna just say really importantly off the top,
3273540	3276340	the I Promise School is a public school.
3276340	3278860	It has a collective bargaining agreement for the teachers.
3278860	3280580	It is not a charter school
3280580	3282460	that might be the most revolutionary thing about it.
3282460	3284380	So let's be clear that this is philanthropy
3284380	3287020	in partnership with public goods,
3287020	3289580	with like democratically funded public goods,
3289580	3291380	public institutions, public schools.
3291380	3293140	So there's the I Promise School
3293140	3295540	that has public governance,
3295540	3297740	but the LeBron James Family Foundation
3297740	3300420	and its partners fund this huge suite
3300420	3301900	of wraparound services.
3301900	3306460	They have food pickup for breakfast, lunch and dinner
3306460	3307300	for the families.
3307300	3310820	There's a barber shop for the parents of the kids
3310820	3313500	and every kid gets a bike and a helmet.
3313500	3314740	Why?
3314740	3316660	Because when LeBron was asked about the bikes,
3316660	3318460	he said, when I was a kid,
3318460	3321620	having a bike was what made me feel free.
3322980	3325780	That to me is like, how do you use money
3325780	3330300	to value the unquantifiable, the human spirit,
3330300	3331140	the intangible?
3331140	3334780	There's no balance sheet that can quantify feeling free.
3334780	3337060	And that's what the philanthropy that he gives
3337060	3342060	can provide alongside the very critical basic services.
3342220	3343660	And is there something that,
3343660	3345220	because you say that and it makes me think,
3345220	3347580	well, you know, that made LeBron feel free.
3347580	3349420	Maybe something else would make some other kid feel free.
3349420	3350260	Absolutely.
3350260	3353620	Maybe a fucking, I felt free when I had a Super Nintendo.
3355460	3357300	And so, is there something about this
3357300	3359100	that makes us avoid that pitfall
3359100	3360820	of LeBron deciding for everybody else?
3361700	3363740	No, I'm not avoiding that pitfall.
3363740	3365620	I'm not gonna pretend that we are.
3365620	3367580	It's true, he does decide,
3367580	3369700	but it's a very embedded decision.
3369700	3372340	It's embedded in his upbringing,
3372340	3374500	in his relationships, in his knowledge.
3374500	3375340	Because he's from there.
3375340	3377900	He actually, at the opening of I Promise, he said,
3378980	3381900	I know what the kids who go to the school are going through.
3381900	3383020	I know the dreams they have.
3383020	3384780	I know the nightmares they have.
3384780	3387060	So it's very deeply empathetic
3387060	3389540	and connected about that.
3389580	3393340	So it's not just, I woke up and I had this quixotic idea
3393340	3394740	that we should just give kids bikes.
3394740	3397620	Like, no, I do know, because I was this kid.
3397620	3399500	Yeah, he didn't do the,
3399500	3401940	let's contrast with what Mark Zuckerberg did
3401940	3404260	with the Newark schools, I think.
3404260	3405100	Yes.
3405100	3405940	Which I think is a bad story.
3405940	3406780	Do you remember the details?
3406780	3408980	Exactly, I'm not very well, I just talked about it.
3408980	3413540	And so, he wanted to kind of parachute into Newark
3413540	3414700	with a hundred million dollars
3414700	3417180	and revolutionized their school system,
3417220	3419460	only to create redistricting maps
3419460	3420460	that didn't take into account
3420460	3422300	where their kids would need to cross highways
3422300	3423500	to get to school.
3423500	3426260	This is one small example of the life.
3426260	3427100	He's not from there.
3427100	3428100	LeBron would make that mistake.
3428100	3430740	LeBron's like, no way, no kids crossing that,
3430740	3432420	like, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.
3432420	3433700	These people go to the schools,
3433700	3435540	like we, I know how the community works.
3435540	3436380	Exactly.
3436380	3437420	As opposed to parachuting in.
3437420	3438260	Exactly.
3438260	3439300	I know how the community works
3439300	3442340	and I'm going to partner with the institutions
3442340	3444900	that are governed by like public officials
3444900	3446500	and you know, public funding.
3446540	3448820	So there's also not that kind of takeover
3448820	3452020	of like now I'm going to become the Mr. Potter of Akron,
3452020	3454420	you know, who just like controls everything.
3454420	3456980	There's a real interconnectedness to how he does it.
3456980	3459820	And that to me is what I would like philanthropy to do
3459820	3462540	is to exist in equilibrium and in partnership,
3462540	3465500	but with a very unique understanding of its role
3465500	3468020	that like we absolutely need government for,
3468020	3469780	I say in the book, we need government for bread
3469780	3471580	and philanthropy for roses.
3471580	3473820	So, oh.
3473820	3474700	Expand on that please.
3474700	3475660	Absolutely.
3475660	3478740	Now, of course, this is much too need of a divide.
3478740	3481100	There's lots of places where this, you know,
3481100	3483420	can blend together in ways you have to work out,
3483420	3485380	but bread and roses is, as you might know,
3485380	3488860	the union slogan of we don't just need sustenance,
3488860	3492340	we need quality of life, we need things that bring us joy,
3492340	3493780	we need culture, we need music,
3493780	3497620	we need things that connect us to our souls.
3497620	3500580	And so again, my sense is like we absolutely need
3500580	3502820	a government that does a much better job
3502820	3503900	than our current government does
3503900	3505900	with providing for our basic needs,
3505900	3507980	but we also need roses and we,
3507980	3510140	I don't know that we can necessarily assume
3510140	3512540	that our government will have the means
3512540	3514780	or the priorities that allow for that.
3514780	3517820	And philanthropy has the flexibility to do that
3517820	3519500	if it does so in proper deference
3519500	3521940	to the authorities of our government.
3521940	3524740	And so let's talk about that deference.
3524740	3526500	Deference to the authorities of our government,
3526500	3528980	meaning in the case of Akron,
3528980	3531940	the democratically elected school board,
3531940	3536220	probably the parent associations, PTAs, whatever,
3536220	3538140	all the various community organs
3538140	3540300	that know what is needed there.
3540300	3542020	Right, all the things that make it
3542020	3544020	very ineffective altruism, right?
3544020	3545900	Like all of these kinds of these,
3545900	3548940	there are relationships of friction and negotiation
3548940	3551900	and solidarity and just juncture
3551900	3553980	that have to be contested.
3553980	3556740	They have to be like democratically contested.
3556740	3558540	That's what it means to be in relationship,
3558540	3560900	but you're doing so with a sense
3560900	3562420	that like you are ultimately there
3562420	3566060	to help provide the things that keep people human,
3566060	3567460	the things that bring them joy,
3567460	3569540	the things that really connect them to one another.
3569540	3571540	And so there's a humility to that
3571540	3573060	and a clear sense of purpose.
3573060	3576900	Yes, and especially when you are in deference
3576900	3580260	to the organizations within the government
3580260	3583060	that are specifically democratic,
3583060	3584620	that are coming from the bottom up.
3584620	3585780	And when I was saying,
3585780	3587220	hey, a lot of the stuff in the budget
3587220	3589180	of the federal government I don't like,
3589180	3591220	a lot of that is driven by the parts
3591220	3592340	that are not democratic.
3592340	3594940	That's driven by corporations having too much power
3594940	3597340	and the people not having enough power.
3597340	3600620	And if we instead are working in deference
3600620	3603860	to the parts of the government that are democratic,
3603860	3604980	where the people do have a voice,
3604980	3606460	then we're on the right path maybe.
3606460	3608140	I think we are, I think we are.
3608140	3609740	So for this Giving Tuesday.
3609740	3610580	Yes.
3610580	3614980	If people, you know, around this time of year,
3614980	3617820	I do think about how fortunate I am
3617860	3620100	to be doing a podcast and YouTube videos
3620100	3622180	and to have a little bit of disposable income.
3622180	3627180	And I want to make sure that I am sharing it with others
3627420	3628820	and making the world a better place
3628820	3630260	in ways that matter to me.
3630260	3633220	What do you suggest that people, you know,
3633220	3634380	think about where they start
3634380	3636100	with their own philanthropic activities
3636100	3637740	to make sure they're not falling into these?
3637740	3639380	Because again, I spent five years
3639380	3640820	following the effective altruists.
3640820	3643020	And I don't mind that my money went to bed nets,
3643020	3646060	but now I'm like, I could have done a little better.
3646100	3648220	There's a balance to strike between giving
3648220	3649220	for the world we have
3649220	3651580	and giving for the world we want to build, right?
3651580	3654780	So I would never say like just give
3654780	3658300	to these sort of evergreen pursuits of culture
3658300	3660220	and recreation and parks
3660220	3662500	because that might feel tone deaf
3662500	3666860	based on the serious local international crises
3666860	3667980	that we find ourselves in.
3667980	3670180	So I don't want to be absolutist about this,
3670180	3672820	but I would say if anything strive for a balance
3672820	3677620	between being responsive to the world that we have
3677620	3681740	and responsive to genuine vulnerability
3681740	3685140	and genuine crisis that is readily accessible
3685140	3687300	to all of us if we look around,
3687300	3689820	but also consider what can you give
3689820	3691260	and where can you give
3691260	3694340	that keeps you in relationship with others
3694340	3697780	that allows you and others to gather, to explore,
3697780	3700180	to flourish, to grow and connect.
3700180	3701980	What institutions can you give
3701980	3704300	that might be locally, they might be nationally,
3704300	3706500	but what can you do that kind of fosters
3706500	3708020	human flourishing with your giving?
3708020	3711260	Do you have an example or even one from your own life
3711260	3714060	of something like that sort of local thing
3714060	3716500	that folks can be in partnership with?
3716500	3717500	Absolutely.
3717500	3721940	So again, in New York, I support my community garden.
3721940	3723460	That's a small thing.
3723460	3728220	I also support museums ranging from ones that are,
3728220	3730580	the name brands that might be like the Met
3730580	3731700	or the Brooklyn Museum.
3731700	3734300	And I especially give to those
3734300	3737300	that are freely accessible to others,
3737300	3740140	that really allow for free admission
3740140	3742260	because that feels the most sort of democratic
3742260	3747060	and inclusive way of sharing that quality of life with others.
3747060	3748620	I have been on the board
3748620	3750500	of some men called the Chautauqua Institution,
3750500	3751620	the Young People's Board.
3751620	3752980	That's a place I grew up going
3752980	3755300	that really fostered these values in me.
3755300	3757460	I come from Cleveland, not far from Akron.
3757460	3760300	So shout out to Northeast Ohio.
3760300	3765300	And so I would give to local social service organizations
3765300	3767660	there and also to museums there.
3767660	3770300	And I should say like not just ones that are,
3770300	3773020	again, those name brands, but maybe smaller ones.
3773020	3775860	They might be local things that work with the schools.
3775860	3778620	They might be a dance troupe
3778620	3781380	that meets at your local community center
3781380	3784580	that people really value or a recreation center.
3784580	3786780	Again, stuff that brings people together
3786780	3789260	in a way that I think is missing so much of the time.
3789260	3792020	And in terms of building worker power
3792020	3794220	or power for average people like that,
3794220	3795060	we were talking about,
3795060	3796660	wouldn't it be great if Mackenzie Scott
3796660	3798140	donated organizations like that?
3798140	3800580	What sort of organizations are you thinking of
3800580	3802980	and how do people go about finding them?
3802980	3805380	Well, first of all, I would say definitely look
3805380	3808260	and see if there are workers on strike
3808260	3809860	and just give to those strike funds.
3809860	3812780	That's definitely a great place to start.
3812780	3815700	The strike funds that the union asks you to donate to,
3815700	3816540	very important.
3816540	3817380	That's a great point.
3817980	3819660	If you want to support a strike,
3819660	3822820	you have to look at how is the union asking you to support
3822820	3825380	because sometimes there'll be other funds around the edges
3825380	3829020	that are not really, you defer to the union, right?
3829020	3831660	Yeah, I agree completely.
3831660	3833780	And so the nonprofits that I mentioned before
3833780	3838540	that I think are really smart about translating advocacy
3838540	3843540	on behalf of the workers and the sort of populists
3845260	3846940	of the United States are really great.
3846940	3848100	That would be demand progress.
3848100	3850180	That would be Americans for financial reform.
3850180	3852860	They're really good at translating demands of the people
3852860	3853980	into real policy.
3853980	3855900	So those would be my other recommendations there.
3855900	3859020	I'll tell you my own part from my donations this year
3859020	3864020	is I've given to the Emergency Workers Organizing Committee,
3864980	3866180	collective, I forget which,
3866180	3870420	which is a group that anybody around the country can call
3870420	3871700	and get connected with an organizer
3871700	3873180	if you're trying to unionize.
3873180	3875180	EWALK, really great organization
3875180	3878460	that comes out of a union effort.
3878460	3882700	And I am looking for a trans-legal defense charity
3882700	3885220	because that's, I think, a very important legal issue
3885220	3887980	right now and those are folks who are really doing
3887980	3892500	the very basic on-the-ground legal and political work
3892500	3895260	to get some of the folks who need power built
3895260	3898620	in our society, most the power that they need.
3898620	3901980	But I'm looking to, as you say,
3901980	3905540	find a place that I can have a relationship with
3905540	3908180	where it's not just like, oh, hey, I'm, you know,
3908180	3910100	take the money and run or whatever,
3910100	3912780	but like, you know, where are the places
3912780	3916100	that are working most closely in their own community?
3916100	3920500	Not just doing the parachuting in like top-down work,
3920500	3923020	but, you know, actually providing legal aid
3923020	3925060	to folks who need it, you know?
3925060	3925900	I do.
3925900	3929260	And I totally second that recommendation.
3929260	3932300	And I think that will sort of require listeners
3932300	3934940	to look in their own communities.
3934940	3935780	Yes, exactly.
3935780	3938380	And kind of just use your sort of embedded networks
3938380	3940500	and your embedded knowledge about, you know,
3940500	3943940	where do you feel things are really making a difference
3943940	3946500	in helping people flourish in the place where you live.
3946500	3948140	That's so wonderful.
