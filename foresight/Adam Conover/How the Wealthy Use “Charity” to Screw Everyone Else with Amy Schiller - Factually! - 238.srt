00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
Hello, and welcome to Factually.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,320
I'm Adam Conover.

3
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,080
Thank you so much for joining me on the show again.

4
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,560
You know, it's giving season,

5
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,240
and if you're like me, you might be wondering,

6
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,640
where the hell should I give my money?

7
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,840
I mean, you want to make the world a better place, right?

8
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,240
But it's difficult to know what charity

9
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,960
or organization to donate to

10
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,600
that's actually going to make a difference,

11
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,840
especially because, you know,

12
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,400
we've got a world full of billionaires

13
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,960
donating money all the time,

14
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,400
and the world doesn't actually seem to be getting better, right?

15
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,200
So how do we actually make an improvement with our money?

16
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,520
Well, a couple years ago,

17
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,800
a savior emerged in the form of a movement

18
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,920
called effective altruism.

19
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,360
This was a group of scientists, philosophers, and researchers

20
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,400
who pledged to use their huge brains

21
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,040
to figure out what the most effective forms of charity were.

22
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,000
They did rigorous research, they conducted studies,

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,320
they held conferences,

24
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,920
and they convinced a lot of very rich people

25
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,840
to donate huge amounts of money

26
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,640
for the betterment of humanity.

27
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,200
It seemed like a really great thing

28
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,720
until a couple years later

29
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,880
when the entire movement collapsed.

30
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,760
It turns out they got into bed with the crypto fraudsters

31
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,160
like Sam Bankman Freed,

32
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,560
and now the entire philosophical movement

33
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,640
behind effective altruism has been largely discredited.

34
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,720
How did this happen?

35
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,160
How did a group of people

36
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,920
dedicated to figuring out the best

37
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,560
and most selfless ways to better humanity

38
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,200
get embroiled in one of the largest financial frauds

39
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,360
of all time?

40
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,680
Is it even possible for philanthropy

41
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,560
to do good in the world when things like this happen?

42
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,840
And how can average people like you or me

43
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,720
donate money to actually make the world

44
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,000
a better place this giving season?

45
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,720
Well, to answer these questions,

46
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,360
we have an incredible guest on the show.

47
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,960

Head to adamconover.net for tickets and tour dates.

62
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,920
And now let's get to today's guest.

63
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,440
Her name is Amy Schiller.

64
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,960
She's a writer and academic

65
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,320
who worked in the world of philanthropy for years.

66
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,000
But now she has a new book out

67
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,600
called The Price of Humanity,

68
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,840
How Philanthropy Went Wrong and How to Fix It.

69
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,520
It is such a smart and entertaining take

70
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,080
on this entire industry and everything that plagues it

71
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,800
and how you can actually make the world a better place.

72
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,920
So without further ado,

73
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,120
let's get to this interview with Amy Schiller.

74
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,320
Amy, thank you so much for being on the show.

75
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,680
It's such a pleasure to be here.

76
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,520
I'm so excited to meet you.

77
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,360
Oh, that's really nice.

78
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,160
I'm very excited to meet you.

79
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,200
Because I've been covering for a long time

80
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,400
the problems with philanthropy.

81
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,760
Philanthropy is proposed to us as this wonderful thing.

82
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,440
It's how the rich change the world.

83
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,400
You can do it yourself.

84
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,360
You can contribute.

85
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,880
What could possibly be bad about giving money away?

86
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,720
You have written an entire book

87
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,320
called The Price of Humanity, How Philanthropy Went Wrong.

88
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,680
The entire thing.

89
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,320
How did philanthropy go wrong?

90
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,440
What is the problem with it?

91
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,520
I'll tell you how I think philanthropy went wrong

92
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,080
because you have very ably covered many ways

93
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,920
that it's gone wrong.

94
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,760
But here's what I think has gone wrong.

95
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,760
It's drifted from the actual meaning of the word philanthropy.

96
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,240
So for me, the entry point is

97
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,440
philanthropy means love of humanity.

98
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,040
And my concern is that I saw a lot of philanthropic

99
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,080
movements and trends moving towards a definition

100
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,960
of humanity that to me felt very narrow and reductive.

101
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,640
So this all comes down to how we define humanity.

102
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,920
Is humanity sustenance merely surviving?

103
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,360
Or is humanity really about thriving

104
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,120
and our full human capabilities to flourish

105
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,640
and to create new things in common with one another?

106
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,640
So my feeling is philanthropy went wrong

107
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,800
when it started to become a utilitarian practice

108
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,880
and not an enabler of human flourishing.

109
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,560
And I think the word utilitarian

110
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,960
is gonna come up a couple of times in this conversation.

111
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:12,240
But what's an example of somebody getting that wrong

112
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,920
so I can understand more better what you mean?

113
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,040
Absolutely.

114
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,000
Well, I'll jump into the sort of hot button version of it

115
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,240
which is effective altruism embodied

116
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,000
by now disgraced fraudster Sam Bankman-Freed

117
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,760
but having a long trajectory before that,

118
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,360
beginning as a philosophy that basically said,

119
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,600
we can rank the moral worth of giving

120
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,280
based on how many lives per dollar we save.

121
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,720
So a very narrow definition of what constituted

122
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,480
valid philanthropy and what philanthropy's purpose was.

123
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,840
And let me say, I first encountered the idea

124
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,920
of effective altruism close to 10 years ago.

125
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,400
I actually, in my first show, Adam Ruins,

126
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,000
everything had some effective altruism adjacent ideas.

127
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,800
For instance, in our very first episode,

128
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,920
which was called Adam Ruins Giving,

129
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,720
it was the pilot of the whole show.

130
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,320
We did a whole segment on how you shouldn't give food

131
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,520
to food banks, you should give money to food banks

132
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,040
because giving food makes you feel good.

133
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,600
Giving money actually helps them the most

134
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,580
because then they can buy the foods

135
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,320
that people actually need.

136
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,440
We made fun of Tom's shoes for giving away

137
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,280
these free shoes when like, why not just give money, right?

138
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,320
Why not give the thing?

139
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,000
Why not trust people to make their own decisions?

140
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,320
Absolutely.

141
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,920
And I think there's a lot of validity to that.

142
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,640
And it, I still think there is to some degree.

143
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,640
It also dovetails with a very rigorous evidence-based approach

144
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,960
that it's like, hey, if we actually,

145
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,120
a lot of charity goes to waste,

146
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,840
if you actually wanna make sure

147
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,120
that the money that you donate goes to the right place,

148
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,080
well, then you should be able to like really rigorously

149
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,720
show that it has had a positive effect.

150
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,040
There are groups like Givewell

151
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,320
that would do these really rigorous studies.

152
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,240
I would read them and look at their recommendations.

153
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,920
And then it was all based on,

154
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,600
yeah, the utilitarian philosophy of Peter Singer, right?

155
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,000
Which is that, I mean, you can probably express it better

156
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,920
than I can, but you know, the sort of general philosophy

157
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,000
of like the ends are the most important thing.

158
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,200
The number of lives saved, the amount of pain

159
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,720
and suffering that you've prevented in the world.

160
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,160
And I always knew, look,

161
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,280
as the holder of a bachelor's in philosophy,

162
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,120
I always knew there's no, you know,

163
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,800
that philosophy isn't necessarily true in all respects,

164
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,520
but it's defensible, right?

165
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,520
It's respectable.

166
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,320
There's a lot of validity to it.

167
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,480
So I always enjoyed this sort of,

168
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,000
oh, very rigorous view of philanthropy.

169
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,240
And for a bunch of years, I would donate money

170
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,560
according to the effective altruist donations

171
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,800
to the Against Malaria Foundation.

172
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,000
That was always the best ranked one.

173
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,040
That was like for every couple thousand dollars

174
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,960
you could save a life.

175
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,240
And I was like, oh, I donated a couple thousand dollars.

176
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,160
I think I saved one life.

177
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,360
That was, I followed a lot of this.

178
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,560
And now we're in a place where it's been entirely discredited

179
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,560
because it got wrapped up in crypto

180
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,080
and San Bank Manfred and AI

181
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,840
and all these really weird practices.

182
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,920
How did that happen?

183
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,320
Okay.

184
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,840
I wanna first just pause and say,

185
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,360
there are some really important things

186
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,800
that you point out here,

187
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,560
which is that giving money is absolutely better

188
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,760
as an act of trust and solidarity

189
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,880
and love for one's fellow human beings than giving stuff,

190
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,800
which is really a mode of kind of retaining control

191
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,480
and retaining a sort of paternalistic view of other people.

192
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,120
I think I know what you need.

193
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,960
Here it is.

194
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,800
Exactly.

195
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,760
If I give you money, you're gonna go spend it on drugs

196
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,600
or alcohol.

197
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,440
Yes.

198
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,960
So here's a nice tie that you can wear

199
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,680
to your office job that I think you should get

200
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,520
for whatever it is.

201
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,360
Exactly.

202
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,800
And actually the problem with effective altruism

203
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,800
starts with a similar but maybe way expanded level

204
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,480
of that kind of hubris.

205
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,200
A sense of we, the smartest people

206
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,360
with the best algorithms know best

207
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,720
how money should be used.

208
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,360
So it was never a philosophy of actual trust

209
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,480
and engagement with other people.

210
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,160
It was always a philosophy of,

211
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,800
here's a philosophical term for you,

212
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,280
epistemological hubris.

213
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,480
A real sense of we can optimize

214
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:21,480
and we can perfect the exact sort of quantifiable change

215
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,240
that our philanthropy is going to produce

216
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,880
and that makes us feel good in the same way

217
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,720
that a lot of philanthropy is really designed

218
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,720
to make the donor feel good, feel validated in themselves.

219
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,840
You're kind of blowing my mind

220
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,800
because the whole premise of effective altruism is,

221
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,960
oh, so many donations are just feel good,

222
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,080
but effective altruism is you point out

223
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,080
feel good in a different way

224
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,080
because you sort of have that.

225
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,080
It's almost like when you buy something

226
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,400
off the wire cutter recommendation,

227
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,040
you're like, I got the best one.

228
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,120
I feel so proud because I know I got the best one

229
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,960
and you follow the Give Well recommendation.

230
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,240
I followed all the evidence.

231
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,400
This says that this is the best donation.

232
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,880
I'm the best little boy.

233
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,720
Well, a very, like a real extension

234
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,400
of the sort of Puritan work ethic of like,

235
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:13,400
oh, instead of I have just have the best character

236
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,280
and now it's I was also the smartest, right?

237
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,600
So you get to, in fact, you get to have both

238
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,720
where you're like, not only am I such a good person,

239
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,400
but I'm the smartest at being a good person.

240
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,560
So there's a lot of ego wrapped up in that method

241
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:32,040
that ultimately I think proved itself, proved it's undoing

242
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,680
that says, okay, this was never really engaged

243
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,920
with the complexities of systems,

244
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,400
the complexities of what people on the ground

245
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,600
might say they need

246
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,200
or even the complexity of systems change.

247
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,640
In fact, if you look at the effective altruists

248
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,840
publications, they would say,

249
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,280
we're not getting involved in political change.

250
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,760
That takes too long.

251
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,120
There's no way to measure the Delta.

252
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,120
There's no way to be secure.

253
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,360
Again, going back to that kind of need

254
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,280
for validation, need for confirmation of efficacy.

255
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,760
So being part of something that might be a longer,

256
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,680
more complex, but ultimately more transformative

257
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,600
initiative for what you use your dollars for

258
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,360
was not attractive to them.

259
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,040
Cause they want, you know, effective altruists want

260
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,160
the immediate, the tangible, the concrete,

261
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,040
the quantifiable for their own gratification,

262
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,880
in my opinion.

263
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,720
Yeah.

264
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,840
Let's talk a little bit about the roots of this movement.

265
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,560
So Peter Singer, again, utilitarian philosopher,

266
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,560
sort of develops these philosophies about,

267
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,160
if you want to do the most good and you should,

268
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,720
that's sort of an ethical burden on you,

269
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,720
then you should figure out the way to save the most lives,

270
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,040
reduce the most suffering.

271
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,440
And it's purely a philosophical position,

272
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,560
but it gets picked up by what we call

273
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,000
the effective altruism movement.

274
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,240
Who are these people and where did they come from?

275
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:02,280
Effective altruism has a lot of purchase among tech wealth

276
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,640
on the West coast.

277
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:08,520
So Dustin Moskovitz, who's one of the Facebook founders,

278
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,360
he's a major, he and his wife, Kerry Tuna,

279
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,920
major funders of Give Well.

280
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,000
Now this goes to other household names, Elon Musk,

281
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,040
has jumped on the effective altruist train.

282
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,600
Peter Thiel has jumped on the effective altruism train

283
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,440
as well.

284
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,720
There's a lot of spread.

285
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,960
I'll have creep, I would say, about this philosophy,

286
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,440
but it fits in neatly with this idea

287
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,400
that the world is reducible to calculation.

288
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,800
The world is reducible to some kind of definitive,

289
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,200
like algorithmic analysis.

290
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,160
So the idea is that a problem like poverty

291
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,760
can be solved by some kind of uniquely identifiable

292
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,800
single kind of line item of what you're gonna give to people.

293
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,920
It could be bed nets.

294
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,800
It could be something else.

295
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:03,120
But it is this idea that somehow there's one intervention

296
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,520
that your money can do that somehow is gonna have

297
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,360
an outsize effect on people's lives.

298
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,760
There's a satisfaction in that, right?

299
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,960
I remember donating the Against Malaria Foundation,

300
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,680
which I have no reason to believe is a bad organization.

301
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,120
And you make your donation and they show you

302
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,360
a little progress update for like the dollars,

303
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,400
how many bed nets your dollars are buying

304
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,000
and where they're going

305
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,440
and how many people they're gonna protect.

306
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,880
And it feels so quantifiable and positive.

307
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,200
Malaria is a huge problem and it kills many people.

308
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,520
And I'll take it on faith

309
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,640
that the lack of bed nets is a problem.

310
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,480
And it's something that I can,

311
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,720
if I buy two more bed nets,

312
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,640
then those are two more people

313
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,720
who are gonna have access to them.

314
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,440
But it is my feeling that it's still my emotion

315
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,200
that is being triggered there.

316
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,040
Right.

317
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,360
Well, the Nobel Prize winning economist, Angus Deaton,

318
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,320
referred to the effective altruist movement as the idea

319
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,160
that lies-

320
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,000
Past guest Angus Deaton, by the way.

321
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,840
Past guest.

322
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,680
Thank you.

323
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,520
Thank you.

324
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,360
Great.

325
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,200
A colleague then.

326
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,200
Just so you know, Nobel Prize on the show before.

327
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,040
And that means one for you in the future.

328
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,880
Thank you.

329
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,720
I appreciate that.

330
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,120
So he referred to effective altruism as the idea

331
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,840
that lives can be bought cheaply, like used cars.

332
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,560
It's the idea that lives are bought,

333
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,640
you're looking for the best deal.

334
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,480
You're looking for lives that you can gain cost-effectively.

335
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,320
Yeah.

336
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,840
That feels like a kind of icky, reductive way

337
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,520
of looking at other human beings.

338
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,800
Yeah, it's like you're doing your charity like storage wars.

339
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,960
Like you're showing up going like,

340
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,040
how much can I get for,

341
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,040
oh, those lives are going for like 10 bucks each.

342
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,960
I can save a bunch of lives over there.

343
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,120
Yes.

344
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,560
And that in fact is used as an argument for,

345
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,240
hey, why would you spend your charity dollar in the US?

346
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,720
It'll go much further if you spend it overseas,

347
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,560
you'll save more lives.

348
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,400
Exactly.

349
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,640
Which is like, on the one hand,

350
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,960
the first time you hear that, you're like,

351
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,080
okay, yeah, maybe I am being, you know,

352
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:03,640
chauvinistic by saying, oh, people in my city are better,

353
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,560
a more important, maybe I should, all lives are equal, right?

354
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,400
Yeah.

355
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,280
But then on the other hand, after a while you start going,

356
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,000
well, why wouldn't I try to improve the place I live?

357
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,840
Right.

358
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,680
That's where I live.

359
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,520
Right.

360
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,840
It's where I live and it's where I'm actually

361
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,600
in relationship with other people.

362
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,440
Exactly.

363
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,640
In some really important way.

364
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,200
So you have a bigger chance, a better shot

365
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,920
at seeing people as full, complex human beings

366
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,400
rather than just these kind of abstract objects

367
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,960
that I refer to them in the book as like avatars of poverty.

368
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,360
There's this like flattening and objectification

369
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,080
of people that comes with giving philosophies

370
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,880
that really see people as only their vulnerability,

371
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,240
only their need, only their desperation,

372
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,320
that you then the hero donor can save

373
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,520
for just one dollar a day with just one bed net.

374
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,160
There's a real, you want to talk about chauvinism,

375
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,200
but there's a real egotistical feedback loop

376
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:00,200
that comes with that that has a less chance of evolution

377
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,600
than if you say, okay, I'm really focusing giving

378
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,720
in a way that keeps me in deep connected relationship

379
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,040
with other people and build some common world

380
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,240
that I want to share with them.

381
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,320
And that's what the people sort of running

382
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,600
this movement kind of lacked.

383
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,120
They weren't actually in community with anybody

384
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,920
other than themselves and the wealthy people

385
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,840
that they hung out with.

386
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,040
And that really led to some biases.

387
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:28,040
Like I used to read the givewell.org recommendations

388
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,960
every year and see how they would rank different things.

389
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,920
And then one year I went, well, hold on a second,

390
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,240
I'm really concerned about climate change.

391
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,600
Have they done any work on climate change?

392
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,000
And I dug into their, like they publish all their papers.

393
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,580
It's very academic and rigorous.

394
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,080
And I went and looked at the climate change

395
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,960
and they had done, you know, a couple of pages on them.

396
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,360
They were like, well, we evaluated some things,

397
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,240
but we couldn't really find proof.

398
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,100
You know, they want really rigorous evidence

399
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,940
that your dollar is going to, you know,

400
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,020
create such and such good.

401
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,340
And they're like, we couldn't really find a charity

402
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,460
that would prove that.

403
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,300
Right.

404
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,460
And I'm going, well, what do you have to?

405
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,940
Like, you know, can't, we have,

406
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,700
like that standard is really high.

407
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,700
And then I started looking at the other things

408
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,300
they were recommending and they had started to go,

409
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,660
oh, a new area of focus for us is AI mitigation.

410
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,900
We're really worried.

411
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,700
And by the way, this was like five to seven years ago.

412
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,700
They were like, we're really worried

413
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,660
that AI is going to take over the world.

414
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,580
And if we invest money right now,

415
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,540
preventing AI from taking over the world,

416
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,380
that's going to be the most valuable.

417
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:26,860
And I was like, who, you're not working on climate change,

418
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,780
but you are working on AI?

419
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,820
Like, what, why?

420
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,660
And-

421
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,780
Well, there's two things happening there.

422
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:38,940
And one is that climate change is really ill-suited

423
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,020
to their framework.

424
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:43,020
It's complex, it's multivalent.

425
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,460
It's going to require lots of different kinds

426
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,580
of interventions, going to require social movements.

427
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,980
Stuff that you can't easily quantify

428
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,540
and it's going to happen at a much slower pace

429
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,820
than the kind of immediacy of like bed net equals life.

430
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,180
You know?

431
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,460
The other thing that's going on there

432
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:04,460
is that the appeal of the long-term future

433
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:08,140
because long-termism is the sort of new fad

434
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:08,980
that you're referring to.

435
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,700
That became their new thing of, oh, we need to think

436
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,980
not just five years or 10 years into the future,

437
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,500
but like 10,000 years.

438
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,340
Right.

439
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,980
This is sort of the end state of thinking of humanity

440
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,940
only in terms of volume.

441
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:25,180
Like how the number of beings that we count as human beings

442
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:28,100
who could maximally be alive

443
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,340
and not about quality of life,

444
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,740
not about quality of our world,

445
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,460
but really just the numbers.

446
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:39,260
I refer in the book to their philosophy

447
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:42,660
of existing human beings as depreciating assets.

448
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,500
Right?

449
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,980
If you're a human being that's alive today,

450
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,300
you have liabilities.

451
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,980
You can't, you know, immediately you can't quite maximize,

452
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,260
we're not ideal figures.

453
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,860
You can't maximize our utility.

454
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,300
You can't maximize our labor.

455
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,740
We might have sickness.

456
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,620
We're going to age.

457
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,660
Like it's like you drive a car off the lot

458
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,620
to extend Angus Deaton's analogy.

459
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:06,300
Like the moment a human being is alive, it has liabilities.

460
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:10,020
And so if they're looking for this perfect, optimized,

461
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,780
idealized human civilization

462
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:17,220
that really is about maximizing the number of human beings

463
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,900
that are alive and productive at any given time,

464
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,940
then you're going to look way into the future

465
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,740
when it's just a computer model.

466
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,180
You're not going to deal with the reality of human beings

467
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,860
in the here and now because it's too complex

468
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,860
and it's too compromised in a way.

469
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,700
There's also a degree to which it's taking

470
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,580
like a philosophical thought experiment

471
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,740
and taking it literally.

472
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,180
Like it's all well and good to write, you know,

473
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,220
well, hey, if I could, you know,

474
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,340
if you could spend $1,000 and save one life today

475
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,060
or you could spend $1,000

476
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,820
and save 10,000 lives in the future

477
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:53,620
because you are preventing AI mitigation

478
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,100
or you're mitigating an AI

479
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,140
that could potentially kill billions of people

480
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,900
in the future and you're blah, blah, blah, blah.

481
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,740
Right.

482
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,740
In a philosophical thought experiment,

483
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,140
you could have a fun time deciding which is more important.

484
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:08,340
But like as if someone who studied philosophy,

485
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,780
I was always like, well, you don't actually do that shit.

486
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,780
You know what I mean?

487
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,100
It's a thought experiment.

488
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,060
Like the Chinese room isn't real.

489
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,860
The lever that makes the train go from one, you know.

490
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,140
I hope I can say on this show

491
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,420
that there's something masturbatory about all of it,

492
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,820
you know, there is something like.

493
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,860
Well, philosophy is inherently masturbatory.

494
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,900
I couldn't agree more.

495
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,100
And that's the great thing about it.

496
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,060
I love masturbating.

497
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,460
Well, it's been great being on the show.

498
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,300
I'm glad.

499
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,460
But I don't, but you know,

500
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,660
masturbating is that's only one part of my life.

501
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,820
I don't take that to the rest of my social life.

502
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,620
I don't have to talk about pie charts, Adam.

503
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,100
We don't have to look at the breakdown.

504
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,020
It's okay.

505
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,340
Let's move off of this metaphor.

506
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,740
But yeah, there's an oddness to taking it.

507
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,740
Even taking utilitarianism, which again,

508
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,940
I think is a philosophy with a lot to recommend it.

509
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,860
I'm not like some Peter Singer hater,

510
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,380
but it is the kind of thing

511
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,740
where when you actually take it really seriously,

512
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,580
you're like, well.

513
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:03,180
The big problem with effective altruism is its absolutism.

514
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,660
The fact that there's really very little room

515
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:09,540
for alternative ways of thinking.

516
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:13,420
And to me, that's symptomatic of a bigger problem,

517
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,860
which is that under our current kind of,

518
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,780
yeah, can I use the term neoliberal here?

519
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,060
Can we talk about neoliberalism?

520
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:20,900
Fantastic.

521
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,300
So under neoliberalism, which is the kind of philosophy

522
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,540
that we really need to be competitive in the market

523
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,860
as much as possible, that our whole lives need to be

524
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:33,340
kind of oriented towards our performance

525
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,020
in the economic market.

526
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,900
It means that that takes over our lives

527
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,100
to the exclusion of all other ways

528
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,660
of relating to ourselves and to other people.

529
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:45,020
And effective altruism is this kind of consummate example

530
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,700
of that taking over philanthropy of saying,

531
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,340
well, human beings are really just,

532
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,500
the metric that we use to judge worth

533
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,380
is whether we're alive and economically productive.

534
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,620
And that's the mode by which we decide

535
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,660
where our charitable dollars go.

536
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,500
And that excludes so many other dimensions

537
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,540
of human life and things that make life worth living

538
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:11,020
and actually make us human.

539
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,420
Well, how did effective altruism get involved

540
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,940
with crypto and with Sam Bankman Freed?

541
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,940
Because this is the oddest part of the story, I think.

542
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,780
Right.

543
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,620
Well, I'm not a journalist with expertise

544
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,380
on the kind of chronology of that,

545
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:30,380
but I can say that early effective altruism

546
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:35,380
was popular among a kind of class of young bankers

547
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:40,300
who signed onto this idea of earning to give, right?

548
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,580
This was part of the philosophy was like,

549
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,220
oh, instead of going to work for a nonprofit

550
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,260
where there's gonna be limits,

551
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:51,700
constraints on how much good I can personally contribute,

552
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,780
the idea is, oh, if I go make a ton of money

553
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,020
working in banking, working in a hedge fund

554
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,780
and I give it away to the most effective charities,

555
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,780
then I'll be doing so much more good.

556
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,420
I don't wanna pause and just say,

557
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:07,940
notice how much the I figures in to all of this.

558
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:11,180
Notice how much this is about the sovereign self,

559
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:14,700
the sovereign control, I as the sort of actor in history.

560
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,020
And there's a missing parentheses in that little story,

561
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:21,580
which is also in the second version, I'll be fucking rich.

562
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,420
Of course.

563
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,260
Right.

564
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,900
I'll have a private jet and a penthouse.

565
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,940
Or, and like, at any time,

566
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,940
I can just keep more of the money if it works for me.

567
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,060
Like even if you start off saying,

568
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,420
okay, I'm gonna live a monkish existence

569
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,940
and donate my seven figure bonuses

570
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,300
to effective altruist ranked charities, that's fine.

571
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,860
But at any given time, you can still choose to pull back

572
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,700
and say, you know what,

573
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,460
I actually would like some of this money for myself.

574
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,660
I feel like I've accumulated enough virtue points

575
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,500
in the world.

576
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,340
Yeah.

577
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:54,740
Versus actually working in service of other people.

578
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,580
Right.

579
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:59,100
And since take a $70,000 a year a job as a social worker,

580
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,060
which would be a great salary for a social worker,

581
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,940
and actually work in service of others,

582
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:06,620
now your needs are less prioritized.

583
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,940
Your needs are less prioritized

584
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,340
and you just don't have as much control.

585
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,180
You don't have as much,

586
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,180
you're working in with other people as well

587
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,260
and within the system.

588
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:18,980
So there's this undercurrent of maximizing the amount

589
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:22,260
of control that you, the donor have,

590
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:26,060
even if you are allegedly doing it all for humanity.

591
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,980
So there's this whole cohort of bankers

592
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,500
who are signing on this philosophy.

593
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,340
Right.

594
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:33,860
There's a story in the book about a guy named Matt Wage,

595
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,340
who was a student of Peter Singers

596
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:39,100
and this is a early description of this philosophy.

597
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:43,500
He says, imagine if you walk past a burning building

598
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:48,500
and you could save all 100 people who were inside.

599
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,420
Like you had a way of like putting out the fire

600
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,860
or you could kick down the door and save 100 people,

601
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:57,180
that would be the greatest day of your life.

602
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:01,660
And you're like the greatest day of your life.

603
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,980
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

604
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,300
Everybody else inside had a pretty shini day.

605
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,140
Right.

606
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,780
Also especially cause there was one guy

607
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,860
trying to save all of them

608
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,420
instead of an entire firefighting system.

609
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,660
And also they're building burned down

610
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:18,660
because of poor safety codes and maybe the building inspector

611
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:21,540
You know, the building inspector had been, you know,

612
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,900
defunded the previous year

613
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,940
because there had been some tax cuts across the city.

614
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,220
So that the, you know, so the hero guy walking around.

615
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,780
A city that now is like,

616
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:32,300
you, the hedge fund you work for holds a bond

617
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,100
against that debt, by the way, right?

618
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,420
So, yes.

619
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,580
Those people didn't have great days,

620
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,780
but the hero who rescued everybody.

621
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,500
You at the best day, right?

622
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:46,500
So, I think you can draw a line from that mentality

623
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,060
to a Sam Bankman freed who says,

624
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:54,420
aha, like here is a movement Taylor made for me,

625
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:58,900
a guy who thinks he is the smartest and the most effective

626
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,180
and really doesn't have to answer to anybody else

627
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,220
as we found out.

628
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,580
He really didn't think he did.

629
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:10,580
So there was a, there's a sort of through line of justification

630
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:14,420
of accumulating wealth by any means

631
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,820
because you're going to put it to, as you put it,

632
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,540
the right ends.

633
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:21,060
So that's how we end up with a Sam Bankman freed.

634
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:24,060
And he became completely entwined

635
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,900
in the effective altruism movement.

636
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,060
My understanding is a huge amount,

637
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:31,020
money started flooding into this movement.

638
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:34,060
The New Yorker did a wonderful piece on this.

639
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,340
You know, they started buying buildings or whatever

640
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,900
and like, you know, having all this space

641
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,660
and you know, yada, yada, yada.

642
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:42,140
And a lot of that money was coming from Sam Bankman freed

643
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,100
and other crypto people.

644
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,340
And now that he is about, as we speak right now,

645
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,260
about to go to prison for a very long time

646
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:52,060
because he was convicted of one of the most massive

647
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,460
financial frauds in American history,

648
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:57,860
it's discredited the movement because the,

649
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,980
like the leading lights of this movement,

650
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:03,500
the philosopher kings who were writing the papers

651
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:08,020
and spreading the good word were like best buddies with him,

652
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:11,300
one of the most unethical people in the history of the country.

653
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,140
Why? Because he had the money.

654
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:17,740
The entire board of the FTX Foundation resigned

655
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:22,740
and wrote an open letter once the indictments came for Sam.

656
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:26,220
And there were a number of responses that basically said,

657
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,900
how could you like, you guys have PhDs from Oxford,

658
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,820
like how could you have worked with this guy

659
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,540
and had a foundation that was allegedly

660
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:36,940
going to give out a hundred million dollars a year, right?

661
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:41,060
And you know, buy into all of this hype

662
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:45,460
without really checking the reality.

663
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,900
Yeah, they were going to give out a hundred million dollars

664
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:52,500
a year to save lives and the future of humanity, yada, yada.

665
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,580
But that was money that they got because they just stole it.

666
00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:00,100
They stole it from other people who were told, like, disappear.

667
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,500
But you misunderstand, those people were dumber.

668
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,220
They were just dumber.

669
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,860
They were dumb enough to believe what we told them,

670
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:11,460
which is that FTX and all that was a great investment.

671
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,740
Exactly.

672
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,940
So clearly they would not have been better.

673
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,740
They were not worthy stewards of this money.

674
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:21,540
The way we, the people stealing it from them, would have been.

675
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,780
One of the things I find most fascinating about this

676
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:26,980
is that it's a really rare example

677
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:30,460
of a philosophical idea or a philosophical movement

678
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,660
starting with Peter Singer and the utilitarians

679
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:35,020
that is now discredited.

680
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,380
I have to think that there's been some backlash

681
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:40,060
in the Philosophical Academy about this

682
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,900
because of its association with the real world.

683
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,580
It's rare for a philosophical idea

684
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,940
to interact with the real world so badly

685
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,140
that it becomes discredited.

686
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,820
That seems to have happened here, at least to me.

687
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:54,380
It has, and it's happened quickly, right?

688
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,340
It's happened in this very compressed timeframe

689
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,300
where you have this rise of trend of effective altruism,

690
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,340
like you say New Yorker profiles,

691
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:04,340
major public figures coming into view.

692
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,460
Not typical to have a giving philosophy

693
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:10,420
becoming such a zeitgeisty thing.

694
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,980
And then you have this scandal that happened

695
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,420
so quickly and so dramatically.

696
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:19,060
And I think what it proved is the flaws

697
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:21,380
that were baked into the philosophical model

698
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,180
immediately proved true,

699
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,540
like the moment it started to interact with,

700
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:29,580
I don't think in a way it's surprising that this happened

701
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:33,460
because this is just the inevitable product

702
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,700
of a philosophy that says we can do the most good

703
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,580
in the world without actually really caring

704
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:40,460
about other people and our obligations to them.

705
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,420
Yeah, it's really interesting.

706
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:44,020
Cause again, utilitarianism is not something

707
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:47,260
I throw out by itself, but the knock against it

708
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,820
is always that it leads to sort of perverse outcomes

709
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,540
if you actually follow through on it.

710
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:54,220
And holy shit, it happened immediately.

711
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,540
Right.

712
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,900
Who could have predicted everyone?

713
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,660
It do be like that.

714
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,620
It do be like that.

715
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,060
Honestly, I'd love to have Peter Singer on this show

716
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,860
because I still think he's a fascinating thinker.

717
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,780
Absolutely.

718
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,780
And I'd love to hear how he interacts

719
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,340
with some of what happened since,

720
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,940
but you know what, let's take a really quick break

721
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,140
cause I want to talk to you when we get back

722
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:17,580
about other streams of philanthropic thought

723
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,580
and mistakes that have been made

724
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:22,340
and how we can actually maybe help each other

725
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,540
in a more productive way.

726
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,900
But we'll be right back with more Amy Shiller.

727
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,420
You know, the year is never more hectic

728
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,700
than during the holiday season

729
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,980
with travel plans, work projects wrapping up.

730
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,020
And if you're on a household,

731
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,140
it's sometimes even hard to remember what's for dinner

732
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,300
or if anyone is remembered to feed the dog.

733
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,540
If this sounds like your home

734
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,900
or the home of someone you know,

735
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,700
this holiday season is time for the gift of organization

736
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,300
with the skylight calendar.

737
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,780
The skylight calendar is a smart touchscreen calendar

738
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:48,700
and organizer for all your chores, groceries and to-dos.

739
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,220
It automatically syncs all the different digital calendars

740
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,500
and events your family uses

741
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,860
and shows them all together

742
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:56,300
on one beautiful touchscreen display.

743
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,940
Skylight calendar is the best way

744
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,540
to give your family peace of mind

745
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,660
to enjoy the things that matter most.

746
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,100
It works by syncing events

747
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,180
from already existing calendars you have,

748
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,500
including Google, Outlook and Apple calendars.

749
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,340
You can also add events directly using the touchscreen

750
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,500
or with the free skylight mobile app.

751
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,380
It shows all family events together in one spot

752
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:18,540
so you can see what everyone has going on each week.

753
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,460
Families are more likely to actually check it

754
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,580
since it's always up to date

755
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,860
so they don't question mom every day about schedules.

756
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,940
And it also comes in two sizes,

757
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:28,300
small 10 inch or large 15 inch.

758
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,060
The large one is wall-mountable

759
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,180
and looks beautiful up on the wall.

760
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,140
And on top of that,

761
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,460
there are multiple view options to choose from,

762
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,020
day, week or month views,

763
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,820
or you can set it to schedule view

764
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,180
to see a few days at a time

765
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,660
formatted in hour by hour blocks.

766
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:45,940
And as a special limited time offer for our listeners,

767
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:48,980
you can get $15 off your purchase of a skylight calendar

772
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,980
You know, if you've listened to my podcast at all,

773
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,940
you know that internet security and privacy

774
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,420
are top concerns of mine.

775
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,460
I don't think you can ever be too safe.

776
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:16,060
And that's why I've used a virtual private network

777
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,900
for years when I'm browsing the web.

778
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,580
Some of you may use a VPN already,

779
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,380
others of you might have heard of VPNs

780
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,940
but not known where to start.

781
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,100
Well, the time is now to make a jump

782
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:28,020
to NordVPN as they're offering an exclusive deal

783
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,660
to factually listeners.

784
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,780
NordVPN shields your IP address

785
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,380
and secures your online traffic

786
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,420
with state of the art encryption.

787
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,780
You can rest assured that you're listening to your podcasts,

788
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,820
streaming shows and browsing the internet

789
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,660
in complete privacy.

790
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,220
No one looking over your shoulder

791
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,620
and no one secretly tracking your data.

792
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,100
My personal favorite feature

793
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,860
is the ability to change your virtual location.

794
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,060
If you're traveling abroad and wanna stream shows

795
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,580
that are only available in the US,

796
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,020
well, wherever you might be,

797
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,660
just choose the little flag icon

798
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,740
for US, Canada, UK, Germany,

799
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,820
or dozens of others

800
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,100
to change where your connection is coming from.

801
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,260
I also really like that there's a built-in ad

802
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,620
and malware blocker.

803
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,340
They won't even make it to your browser,

804
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,700
stop dead in their tracks

805
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,060
before you even load those bad boys.

806
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,940
NordVPN is simple to set up,

807
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,140
even simpler to use

808
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,740
and this is simply the best time to try it out.

809
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,780
So if you wanna join me and use a VPN

00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,500

without triggering your gag reflex.

839
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:18,020
It is pumpkin pie season after all.

840
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,460

00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,980

or listen in wherever you get your podcasts.

845
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:29,300
Do you know how much of your personal data

846
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,900
is out there on the internet?

847
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,820
There's a good chance

848
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:34,140
it's a lot more than you'd be comfortable with.

849
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,740
Every day, personal data is being sold

850
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,300
and traded online by data brokers.

851
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,540
But that doesn't mean you can't stay private

852
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,540
and protect that personal data.

853
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:46,100
And delete me is an indispensable tool

854
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,620
for this very purpose.

855
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,300
Delete me's teams of experts

856
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,140
will scan the internet to find

857
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,660
and delete your personal data

858
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,180
and you will get a detailed report

859
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:56,620
of their findings in just seven days.

860
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:59,540
We live in an era of doxing online harassment

861
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:02,700
and ID theft that can compromise not just your finances

862
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,260
but potentially even ruin job opportunities.

863
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,940
About 41% of Americans are exposed

864
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,740
to some form of online harassment.

865
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,060
And let me tell you something

866
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,940
as a public figure on the internet,

867
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,700
that's something that I deal with myself.

868
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:17,460
And that is why I have been a subscriber

869
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,980
to Delete Me for years.

870
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,500
Years before they even sponsored this podcast,

871
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,220
I just used their service.

872
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,820
In fact, I signed up my entire family for it

873
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:28,420
because I didn't want any of our names, addresses,

874
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:31,380
phone numbers, any of that personal information online

875
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,820
where people can just get it whenever they want.

876
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:36,540
I wanted to keep myself safe and all of us safe.

877
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,660
And let me tell you something,

878
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:40,540
Delete Me has done a fantastic job of that for me.

879
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,740
So if you wanna safeguard yourself

880
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,180
and live with a peace of mind

881
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,620
that experts are hunting down

882
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,420
and removing your personal information

883
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,980
from the internet every three months,

884
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,660
then check out Delete Me.

885
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:53,340

and get 20% off with the code Adam.

889
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,900
Okay, we are back with Amy Schiller

890
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:07,380
talking about philanthropy and all of its problems.

891
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,500
And solutions.

892
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,340
And solutions, we're gonna talk about solutions too,

893
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,380
but I wanna talk about one more problem first.

894
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,300
Yes, let's.

895
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,500
We just talked about the philosophy

896
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,100
of effective of altruism.

897
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,420
I've covered recently on my YouTube channel,

898
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,060
billionaire philanthropy.

899
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:21,420
People like Bill Gates, Warren Buffett,

900
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,380
Andrew Carnegie going back into history,

901
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,540
this idea that billionaires can save the world

902
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,060
by donating all of their money.

903
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,460
And people can go watch that video

904
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:33,340
if they wanna sort of see the full version of that debunking

905
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,420
and my thoughts on it.

906
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,540
But I wanna ask you about a specific example of it

907
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:39,540
that's often presented as being a positive

908
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,260
because I know you covered in the book.

909
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:46,260
Mackenzie Scott, who is Jeff Bezos' ex-wife.

910
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,300
I was gonna say widow.

911
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,900
He's not dead, we can hope.

912
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:54,460
His ex-wife, she received billions in the divorce,

913
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:57,060
and she has been giving the money away like crazy.

914
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,580
And people will often say in the comments of my videos,

915
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,700
I'm Mackenzie Scott, now she's a great example.

916
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,660
She's a good example of this

917
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,940
because she's just trying to get rid of this shit.

918
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:08,180
I'm curious what your take is on her.

919
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:11,020
Well, it's very like, you're right, you're also right.

920
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,860
A very kind of fiddler on the roof approach

921
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,380
where it's like, you're right,

922
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:18,100
she is doing it better than any billionaire, right?

923
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,340
She's giving her money away

924
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:22,220
in really admirable transformative ways.

925
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:24,700
And what makes it better than how they give it away?

926
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,140
She gives it away unrestricted.

927
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,340
That's the number one thing.

928
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,660
And I'll get back to that in a second,

929
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:35,660
but the thing is that she is doing her philanthropy

930
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,660
I think better than others, but because of that,

931
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:42,260
you can see the limits of philanthropy's actual power

932
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,060
to create social change.

933
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,580
So I'll explain why.

934
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:49,740
So Mackenzie Scott gives away

935
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,980
tens of millions of dollars in tranches

936
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:54,780
and she works with a team of consultants

937
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,420
and they do a lot of vetting behind the scenes.

938
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:00,820
And so unlike many situations where nonprofits

939
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:03,060
have to write grant reports

940
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,980
and massage all their language to fit a funder's,

941
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:08,340
oh, we're really interested in this particular thing

942
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,620
or can you make this about dogs somehow?

943
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,220
There's like so much.

944
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,620
I wanna build it with my name on it.

945
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,100
Can I have a nice building?

946
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:19,020
There's so much catering to the idiosyncratic preferences

947
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,980
of funders and it takes up a ton of time

948
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,700
and then you have to do reporting that shows like,

949
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,140
oh, we spent the money on exactly the thing

950
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,100
that we said we were gonna spend it on

951
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:31,060
to, I think, very burdensome degrees, right?

952
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,220
There's certainly a case to be made

953
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,260
that you should do some of that,

954
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,740
but this is very burdensome.

955
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,140
Many nonprofits complain about this.

956
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,660
So Mackenzie Scott instead,

957
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:42,420
what she does is she just makes up her list with her team.

958
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:47,340
Her team then calls the recipients and says,

959
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:50,860
you've just been allocated some millions of dollars

960
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:54,980
from Mackenzie Scott, unrestricted, very little reporting.

961
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:57,380
Like you just got this giant windfall

962
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,260
and you don't have to jump through all the hoops

963
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:02,300
that you normally have to jump through to get funding.

964
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,980
This is super transformative

965
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:08,860
because what this does is displaces the stature

966
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:12,220
and the power of Mackenzie as the donor

967
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:15,140
and really says this is about just getting money to people

968
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:17,020
and to go back to our theme of trust,

969
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,220
trusting these institutions to use it

970
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,660
in the way that they see fit.

971
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:23,140
So there's a lot of giving away, not just of money,

972
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:25,460
but of oversight and discretion,

973
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,300
which is really a form of power.

974
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,380
I think that's super admirable

975
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,940
and I think that many people should be taking her example

976
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:35,580
and not putting nonprofits through all of these paces

977
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,860
to try and get all this money.

978
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,260
And this is similar to when we were talking

979
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:40,180
at the beginning of giving someone,

980
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:42,540
hey, here's money, you know what to do best with it.

981
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,660
I'm not worried that you're gonna spend it

982
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,420
on the wrong thing, like alcohol.

983
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,900
It's very similar to donating to an individual person.

984
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,380
It gives them that trust

985
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,220
and it deprioritizes you, the giver.

986
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,060
That's good.

987
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,700
Exactly, I think that's the best thing.

988
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,140
Where I think you see the limits is,

989
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:59,500
Mackenzie Scott has made many public statements

990
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,620
where she talks about her concerns

991
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:05,340
about social and economic justice, racial injustice,

992
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,140
that she wants this money to go,

993
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:11,060
not to elite institutions, but to HBCUs, for example,

994
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:14,500
or she wants it to go to local social service organizations,

995
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:18,420
things that are not priorities for the billionaire class.

996
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,380
These are really gifts that she's making

997
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:24,180
to organizations that serve poor,

998
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,580
working and otherwise disenfranchised people

999
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,660
in the United States.

1000
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:31,180
That's also great and great and unusual.

1001
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:34,780
The only problem is that for all of the money

1002
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,100
that she has and all the money

1003
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,300
that she's shoveling out the door,

1004
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:41,260
the metaphor I use in the book is Lucy and Ethel

1005
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,980
at the chocolate factory.

1006
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,260
It's like they can't wrap the chocolate fast enough

1007
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:48,260
to get it out the door like she desperately wants to.

1008
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,820
Unfortunately, her holdings of Amazon stock

1009
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,620
mean that she's just gonna keep accumulating money

1010
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,500
even faster than she can give it away.

1011
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,740
Wow.

1012
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,340
So that's one problem.

1013
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,180
Interesting.

1014
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,980
So she hasn't divested from the Amazon stock.

1015
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:03,580
She still has, the money is growing, what?

1016
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,660
Because Amazon stock price can be used, right?

1017
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,300
Now, this is as far as I know.

1018
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,620
Like I can't say I know the contents of her portfolio,

1019
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,740
but if we assume that it's from Amazon stock,

1020
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:16,420
then yes, her wealth is just growing at a faster rate

1021
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:19,780
than she could give it away even at this revolutionary pace.

1022
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,420
But she could give it away.

1023
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,620
I mean, it's possible to divest,

1024
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:26,180
but she's sort of still using an endowment sort of model

1025
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:29,580
where she has a big pot and then the proceeds

1026
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,580
from the investment is what is being given away.

1027
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:33,540
So her metaphor is she wants to give

1028
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,140
until the safe is empty.

1029
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,620
Now the problem with the safe is that

1030
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,780
there's like a static amount of money in there.

1031
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:40,500
It's not like, oh, it gets refilled

1032
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,300
and then you have to like continuously empty it.

1033
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:46,660
But there's a different strain of issue here,

1034
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,260
which is that she could,

1035
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:52,060
she could of course officially divest herself of her stock

1036
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:54,420
or she could put a billion dollars

1037
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,900
into the Amazon Worker Strike Fund.

1038
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,380
She could use this money,

1039
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,860
not in these kind of downstream palliative ways

1040
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,220
where she gives it to nonprofits

1041
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:06,620
that are trying to kind of make up for the deprivations

1042
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:09,260
that people face in a deeply unequal society.

1043
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,140
She could do something much more radical

1044
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:13,780
and confrontational with the amount of money that she has

1045
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,620
that would actually change labor relations,

1046
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,340
that would actually change policy,

1047
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:20,460
that might actually do something to prevent

1048
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:23,380
these conditions of inequality that so concern her.

1049
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,260
So this model of charitable giving

1050
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:28,060
as a mode of social justice,

1051
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:31,300
it kind of comes too late in the process.

1052
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,900
You would have to intervene upstream

1053
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:37,500
in our political system in a more confrontational way.

1054
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:40,140
So I think as chaired, as philanthropy, it's great,

1055
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:42,580
but as social justice, I think it's very limited.

1056
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,180
So, okay, that's really interesting

1057
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,340
because she's giving away the money

1058
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,940
in a way that deprioritizes her.

1059
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,740
But it sounds like what you're saying is the choices

1060
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:52,540
that she's making her priorities of who gets the money,

1061
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:54,660
it's still her team figuring it out,

1062
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:58,460
she still has some biases or some things

1063
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,060
she maybe doesn't quite understand.

1064
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:03,500
Maybe just, I would say some limitations, right?

1065
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,340
Like there's, I would love to see her go farther.

1066
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:11,340
I would love to see her become a champion of workers rights

1067
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:16,060
that would be much more revolutionary, much more radical,

1068
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,820
and it wouldn't just be redistributing money,

1069
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:20,620
it would be genuinely redistributing power.

1070
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:23,900
So let's talk about what kind of donation that would be.

1071
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:27,780
I mean, if one were to actually donate money

1072
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,100
to a place that would actually do these things,

1073
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,540
what sort of organizations are we talking about?

1074
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:34,420
So if we're talking about nonprofits,

1075
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:37,660
there are some excellent advocacy nonprofits.

1076
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:40,020
There's Americans for financial reform,

1077
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:43,020
there's demand progress, there's the revolving door project.

1078
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:46,220
There are a number of nonprofits that really seek to

1079
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:49,580
weaken the power of corporations in government.

1080
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:52,060
And again, I have to echo donating money

1081
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:54,340
to union strike funds would be an incredibly

1082
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:56,420
ballsy and revolutionary move.

1083
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:59,180
That would really be about giving workers the power

1084
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,380
to negotiate for their own conditions.

1085
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,860
Frankly, you could probably just give money

1086
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:05,140
to union networks more broadly.

1087
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:07,740
They all have operating foundations as well.

1088
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:11,100
So there's some confrontational giving

1089
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:15,220
that is right on the line between charitable giving,

1090
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:17,980
501c3 and a form of like political giving.

1091
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,860
You might even give it to a 501c4

1092
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,380
that more actively does lobbying.

1093
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:24,180
So that's one way to do it,

1094
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:26,260
where you would actually be giving to places

1095
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:30,380
that are challenging our policies and our norms

1096
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:33,740
and our dynamics of labor and race and power.

1097
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:37,700
And not just from a kind of marginal position,

1098
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:40,420
but really confrontationally in the halls of power.

1099
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:42,460
But there's still a problem there.

1100
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:45,300
Cause I imagine, I take your point very well.

1101
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:48,380
And as a member of two unions,

1102
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:52,100
one of which SAG-AFTRA did not have the strike fund

1103
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:56,180
set up as year round as the Writers Guild does

1104
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:57,940
and needed a lot of donations very quickly

1105
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:59,180
for that strike fund.

1106
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:02,620
If they were to suddenly have, hey, we're on strike.

1107
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,460
Well, guess what?

1108
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:06,220
Here's $500 million or whatever from Mackenzie Scott.

1109
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:09,740
That would have changed the strike enormously.

1110
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:11,980
It would have meant that actors could have,

1111
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:13,860
and by the way we're talking today,

1112
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:16,700
the day after the strike was resolved and ended.

1113
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:17,780
And congratulations on that.

1114
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:18,620
Thank you very much.

1115
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,540
I know you're very active on that board.

1116
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,340
Yeah, I'm active in the Writers Guild.

1117
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:24,780
I'm just a SAG-AFTRA member.

1118
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:26,580
But I'm an active member,

1119
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,700
but I don't serve in any leadership role.

1120
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:33,700
But if there was a strike fund that was 10 times

1121
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,820
what it had been,

1122
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:37,700
the membership would have been in a very different place.

1123
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:39,700
Maybe it could have held out even longer if necessary.

1124
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:40,940
I mean, hopefully not,

1125
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:44,300
but it would have changed the facts on the ground.

1126
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:46,100
It would have given the workers a lot more power.

1127
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,500
So I take that point,

1128
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:51,020
but I do wonder if she did have those priorities.

1129
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:56,020
If she said Mackenzie Scott divorces Jeff Bezos,

1130
00:44:56,540 --> 00:45:00,180
and she reads a bunch of Jane McAleavy books

1131
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:02,980
and the Communist Manifesto

1132
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:06,380
and realizes that worker power is the most important thing

1133
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:09,940
and she wants to donate to those structural places, right?

1134
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,420
I could see someone making the argument.

1135
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:14,700
Well, now she's following her other set

1136
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:17,140
of ideological commitments and biases,

1137
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:20,900
which are still a fact about her, right?

1138
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,580
And maybe there's something even more efficient

1139
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:23,420
she could have done.

1140
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:25,140
Like, isn't part of the problem

1141
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:29,620
that one person is calling the shots at all,

1142
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:32,000
isn't, wouldn't it be better just to like,

1143
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:35,780
take the money away and let us vote on it?

1144
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:36,620
You know what I mean?

1145
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:37,740
Or something like that.

1146
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:40,940
Of course, that, yes,

1147
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:44,820
expropriating wealth for public use is a huge part of this.

1148
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:48,800
I think I'm thinking about what is in the short

1149
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,700
to medium horizon of possible.

1150
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:51,540
Yeah, of course.

1151
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,140
So I totally take your point and agree with you.

1152
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:56,900
And there's stuff in the book about how we change

1153
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:00,380
tax incentives and how we change our political economy

1154
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:02,420
for a number of reasons,

1155
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:03,960
but one being so that philanthropy

1156
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,900
is not this highly stratified activity

1157
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:08,060
that's only done by the mega rich,

1158
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:11,460
but that we have greater equality

1159
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:12,780
and democratization of wealth,

1160
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:15,740
such that we have democratization of giving as well.

1161
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:18,380
So I completely agree with you.

1162
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:21,860
That's really interesting, democratization of giving.

1163
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:23,380
So expand on that, please.

1164
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:26,020
So democratization of wealth really means

1165
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:29,220
a more equitable distribution of wealth.

1166
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:31,420
And democratization of giving would then mean

1167
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:33,380
more people had the discretionary income

1168
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:37,260
that they could participate even in small ways in giving.

1169
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:39,980
So one of the concepts that I put forth in the book

1170
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:44,980
is the idea of going beyond a living wage to a giving wage.

1171
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:48,500
So we have this idea of a living wage that would pay people.

1172
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,580
So apparently we need a special term to say

1173
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:52,780
workers are actually supposed to be able to live on

1174
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:53,700
what they earn.

1175
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:56,740
This is like already a paradigm change

1176
00:46:56,740 --> 00:47:00,380
that we shouldn't need to have, but we're working on it.

1177
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:02,980
I suggest that we need to go even further

1178
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:05,020
and say people should be paid a giving wage.

1179
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:06,740
They should be paid enough

1180
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:10,060
that they can also afford even nominally to give back.

1181
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:12,340
So we're recording this a couple of weeks

1182
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:14,380
before Giving Tuesday, for example,

1183
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:16,020
like this day after Thanksgiving,

1184
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:19,060
which is one of the largest days of giving in the year,

1185
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:20,500
right before giving season starts,

1186
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,820
30% of all gifts are made in December.

1187
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:27,100
So my sense is giving is really one expression

1188
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:28,900
of the health of our democracy.

1189
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:32,100
And so I would wanna see people paid more

1190
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:38,180
and with more robust social welfare policies

1191
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:40,860
that enable us all the security and the freedom

1192
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:43,460
to give to things that actually enable human flourishing

1193
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:44,660
in our communities.

1194
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:46,860
Yeah, if we were,

1195
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:49,900
if we had a more equitable economy overall,

1196
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:52,500
then more people would be able to donate

1197
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,900
and we wouldn't have the equity problems

1198
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,420
that we do with philanthropy

1199
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:59,460
because it would be overall more democratic.

1200
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:02,420
And actually the labor movement

1201
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:03,820
is maybe a good example of this

1202
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:07,420
because folks who have union jobs generally,

1203
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:10,300
on average earn more than folks who do not.

1204
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:13,060
And part of a small percentage,

1205
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:15,460
I forget what my total dues are,

1206
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:19,900
a percent or so of my salary goes to the union,

1207
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:24,900
which is a not for profit that works for the benefit

1208
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:28,700
of me and others in my industry and community.

1209
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:30,180
It's not quite a charity,

1210
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:31,620
but it's sort of an example of this

1211
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:36,620
where the labor movement is this durable nonprofit

1212
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:41,260
power center for workers' rights and for equality

1213
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:45,100
and generally green things

1214
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:46,980
and all the good things that we like.

1215
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:51,100
And it is funded by the fact that the workers,

1216
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:52,940
the workers each chipping in a little bit,

1217
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:54,740
which they're able to do because they're all paid more.

1218
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:55,860
Exactly.

1219
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:58,340
And to expand,

1220
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:01,060
yes, the unions are a crucial example of this.

1221
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:04,540
And then there are parts of our lives

1222
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:06,420
that really secure our quality of life.

1223
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:07,700
They might be our parks,

1224
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:09,540
they might be cultural institutions,

1225
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:11,820
they might be houses of worship,

1226
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:13,860
they might be recreation centers.

1227
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:17,660
Like if we think about those as power centers as well,

1228
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:20,820
places that really affirm human worth

1229
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:22,620
beyond our economic productivity,

1230
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:26,020
places that really cultivate human community and connection,

1231
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:27,740
that is a form of building power.

1232
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:31,540
That is a form of affirming human value and human worth

1233
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:34,820
beyond our economic productivity.

1234
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:36,060
Yeah, is it?

1235
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:37,860
I gotta say though, you mentioned churches, right?

1236
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:41,700
And churches are probably the most common form

1237
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:44,100
of community-based philanthropy.

1238
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:45,940
Many, many Americans are members of churches.

1239
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:49,540
Many churches have an ideology of you should chip in a bit.

1240
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:51,980
And some religions or some denominations,

1241
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:55,380
that's tithing where people donate a lot of their income.

1242
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:56,380
And I have to say,

1243
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:58,820
not all those churches are institutions

1244
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:01,420
that spend money in ways that benefit society.

1245
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:03,060
Some of them spend money in ways that benefit

1246
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:04,460
only the people who go to the church,

1247
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:05,660
that protect wealth,

1248
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:09,420
that there are some very regressive churches out there.

1249
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:12,660
And so I'm wondering if our desire

1250
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:14,980
to have a version of philanthropy

1251
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:19,340
that is going to be good in every respect is a problem.

1252
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:21,500
I mean, I said a second ago, right?

1253
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:22,820
What if we just take the money away

1254
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:24,900
and we all vote on what to do with it, right?

1255
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:27,140
And it's very easy for me to say.

1256
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:28,860
Ha, ha, ha, fuck the billionaires, take the money away,

1257
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,980
let's all vote, let's have it be democratic.

1258
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:33,020
Unfortunately, we do currently have a system

1259
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:35,180
where we do that to some extent, it's called taxes.

1260
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:37,580
And I think if any single person in the country

1261
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:40,060
were to look at what taxes are spent on,

1262
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:41,780
every single person in the country would say,

1263
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:43,820
I fucking hate a lot of this, right?

1264
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:47,060
And that's because democracy is a fucking mess.

1265
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:48,460
And people do not agree,

1266
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:50,860
and there's a lot of assholes in every society,

1267
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:53,020
and there's power imbalances in society,

1268
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:55,060
and there's hierarchies, and there's,

1269
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:57,060
people, corporations are able to say,

1270
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:58,660
oh, hold on, there's a lot of money being given out,

1271
00:50:58,660 --> 00:50:59,780
why don't we get some for ourselves?

1272
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:02,580
We're powerful enough that we can,

1273
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:05,940
military industrial complex and all that shit, right?

1274
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:10,940
And it sort of seems like in order to find that path

1275
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:13,820
to a positive philanthropy,

1276
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:17,940
we need to solve every power-based problem in society,

1277
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:20,100
which seems like a tall order.

1278
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:21,300
When you put it that way.

1279
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:23,220
I'm very sorry,

1280
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:25,540
do you have an answer to this question in your book?

1281
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:27,740
It's called how to fix philanthropy,

1282
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:29,460
how to fix everything.

1283
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:34,460
But I guess to me, I see having this diversified set

1284
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:37,580
of tactics of how we can use money for social good

1285
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:40,860
kind of offsets some of the challenges

1286
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:42,060
that you just listed.

1287
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:45,780
So there's a story in the book that points out exactly

1288
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:46,660
what you said that like,

1289
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:49,100
even our democratically elected governments

1290
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,820
are not always going to have the interests

1291
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:54,020
of human flourishing at heart, right?

1292
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:55,780
They might be hostile.

1293
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:59,540
And so, you know, as much as the leftist in me is concerned

1294
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:02,020
that what I'm saying is, you know,

1295
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:05,340
a libertarian or otherwise mistrustful of government,

1296
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:08,700
I do think there's something to be said for pluralism.

1297
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:12,060
So the story is that in the late 90s,

1298
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:14,420
Rudy Giuliani, the then mayor of New York,

1299
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:18,940
wanted to sell off about 140 plots of land

1300
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:22,340
that were allocated for community gardens.

1301
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:24,220
And he wanted to sell them to developers

1302
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:26,540
and his argument was somehow like, we need this land,

1303
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:27,700
we need it for housing.

1304
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:32,700
These gardens are just, you know, these elite spaces

1305
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,820
that are just kind of draining public resources.

1306
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:37,060
And really what he meant was,

1307
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:38,660
this is not economically productive.

1308
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:39,580
This is not right.

1309
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:41,100
So.

1310
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:43,100
And these sort of spaces, by the way,

1311
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:44,740
are one of the things that make New York City

1312
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:46,180
a wonderful city that it is,

1313
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:48,860
this is a city where we're recording in New York right now,

1314
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:51,100
you walk around like, oh, there's a tiny little park.

1315
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:53,020
It's just like the size of one little building.

1316
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:54,140
At some point they knocked down a building

1317
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:55,020
and built a little park there.

1318
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:57,780
And it's one of the beautiful things.

1319
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:58,980
Not only did they knock down a building,

1320
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:02,620
but it was actually largely black and Latinx communities

1321
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:05,300
that took over vacant lots in the 1970s

1322
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:06,860
and turned them into these gardens.

1323
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:09,580
So they're actually our legacies of, you know,

1324
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:12,300
people of color and grassroots reclaiming

1325
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:14,340
of public space and building their communities.

1326
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:19,020
So what the short version of what saved these spaces

1327
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:23,420
is a fundraising campaign spearheaded by Bette Midler

1328
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:27,300
that for $2.4 million bought these plots

1329
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:29,380
and then donated them to a land trust,

1330
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:31,620
donated them to New York City land trust.

1331
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:34,140
So there's this way in which philanthropy

1332
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:39,140
can be this lever of using money for like humanism

1333
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:44,820
even in the undesirable moments

1334
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:46,980
when our governments do not have that

1335
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:48,700
in their core interests.

1336
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:52,340
So you actually feel that philanthropy

1337
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:55,100
is not by itself bad.

1338
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:58,740
It's the way we've been going about it.

1339
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:00,940
It's the over prioritization

1340
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:04,700
and that there is a version of philanthropy

1341
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,540
that would be productive.

1342
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:10,300
There is a thing that Warren Buffett could do

1343
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:12,620
that would be net positive.

1344
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:16,540
So the best story I can give you to exemplify this,

1345
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:17,660
it's the last part of the book

1346
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:19,740
and it's a profile of LeBron James.

1347
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:23,180
So LeBron has a network of institutions

1348
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:27,220
that his foundation has helped start in Akron, Ohio.

1349
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:30,740
And the first of them is the I Promise School.

1350
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:33,540
And I wanna just say really importantly off the top,

1351
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:36,340
the I Promise School is a public school.

1352
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:38,860
It has a collective bargaining agreement for the teachers.

1353
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:40,580
It is not a charter school

1354
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:42,460
that might be the most revolutionary thing about it.

1355
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:44,380
So let's be clear that this is philanthropy

1356
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:47,020
in partnership with public goods,

1357
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:49,580
with like democratically funded public goods,

1358
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:51,380
public institutions, public schools.

1359
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:53,140
So there's the I Promise School

1360
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:55,540
that has public governance,

1361
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:57,740
but the LeBron James Family Foundation

1362
00:54:57,740 --> 00:55:00,420
and its partners fund this huge suite

1363
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:01,900
of wraparound services.

1364
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:06,460
They have food pickup for breakfast, lunch and dinner

1365
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:07,300
for the families.

1366
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:10,820
There's a barber shop for the parents of the kids

1367
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:13,500
and every kid gets a bike and a helmet.

1368
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:14,740
Why?

1369
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:16,660
Because when LeBron was asked about the bikes,

1370
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:18,460
he said, when I was a kid,

1371
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:21,620
having a bike was what made me feel free.

1372
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:25,780
That to me is like, how do you use money

1373
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:30,300
to value the unquantifiable, the human spirit,

1374
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:31,140
the intangible?

1375
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:34,780
There's no balance sheet that can quantify feeling free.

1376
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:37,060
And that's what the philanthropy that he gives

1377
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:42,060
can provide alongside the very critical basic services.

1378
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:43,660
And is there something that,

1379
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:45,220
because you say that and it makes me think,

1380
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:47,580
well, you know, that made LeBron feel free.

1381
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:49,420
Maybe something else would make some other kid feel free.

1382
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:50,260
Absolutely.

1383
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:53,620
Maybe a fucking, I felt free when I had a Super Nintendo.

1384
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:57,300
And so, is there something about this

1385
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:59,100
that makes us avoid that pitfall

1386
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:00,820
of LeBron deciding for everybody else?

1387
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:03,740
No, I'm not avoiding that pitfall.

1388
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:05,620
I'm not gonna pretend that we are.

1389
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:07,580
It's true, he does decide,

1390
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:09,700
but it's a very embedded decision.

1391
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:12,340
It's embedded in his upbringing,

1392
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:14,500
in his relationships, in his knowledge.

1393
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:15,340
Because he's from there.

1394
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:17,900
He actually, at the opening of I Promise, he said,

1395
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:21,900
I know what the kids who go to the school are going through.

1396
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:23,020
I know the dreams they have.

1397
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:24,780
I know the nightmares they have.

1398
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:27,060
So it's very deeply empathetic

1399
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:29,540
and connected about that.

1400
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:33,340
So it's not just, I woke up and I had this quixotic idea

1401
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:34,740
that we should just give kids bikes.

1402
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:37,620
Like, no, I do know, because I was this kid.

1403
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:39,500
Yeah, he didn't do the,

1404
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,940
let's contrast with what Mark Zuckerberg did

1405
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,260
with the Newark schools, I think.

1406
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:45,100
Yes.

1407
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:45,940
Which I think is a bad story.

1408
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:46,780
Do you remember the details?

1409
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:48,980
Exactly, I'm not very well, I just talked about it.

1410
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:53,540
And so, he wanted to kind of parachute into Newark

1411
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:54,700
with a hundred million dollars

1412
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:57,180
and revolutionized their school system,

1413
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:59,460
only to create redistricting maps

1414
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:00,460
that didn't take into account

1415
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:02,300
where their kids would need to cross highways

1416
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:03,500
to get to school.

1417
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:06,260
This is one small example of the life.

1418
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:07,100
He's not from there.

1419
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:08,100
LeBron would make that mistake.

1420
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:10,740
LeBron's like, no way, no kids crossing that,

1421
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:12,420
like, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.

1422
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:13,700
These people go to the schools,

1423
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:15,540
like we, I know how the community works.

1424
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:16,380
Exactly.

1425
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:17,420
As opposed to parachuting in.

1426
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:18,260
Exactly.

1427
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:19,300
I know how the community works

1428
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:22,340
and I'm going to partner with the institutions

1429
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:24,900
that are governed by like public officials

1430
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,500
and you know, public funding.

1431
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:28,820
So there's also not that kind of takeover

1432
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:32,020
of like now I'm going to become the Mr. Potter of Akron,

1433
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:34,420
you know, who just like controls everything.

1434
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:36,980
There's a real interconnectedness to how he does it.

1435
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:39,820
And that to me is what I would like philanthropy to do

1436
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:42,540
is to exist in equilibrium and in partnership,

1437
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:45,500
but with a very unique understanding of its role

1438
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:48,020
that like we absolutely need government for,

1439
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:49,780
I say in the book, we need government for bread

1440
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:51,580
and philanthropy for roses.

1441
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:53,820
So, oh.

1442
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:54,700
Expand on that please.

1443
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:55,660
Absolutely.

1444
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:58,740
Now, of course, this is much too need of a divide.

1445
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:01,100
There's lots of places where this, you know,

1446
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:03,420
can blend together in ways you have to work out,

1447
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:05,380
but bread and roses is, as you might know,

1448
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:08,860
the union slogan of we don't just need sustenance,

1449
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:12,340
we need quality of life, we need things that bring us joy,

1450
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:13,780
we need culture, we need music,

1451
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:17,620
we need things that connect us to our souls.

1452
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:20,580
And so again, my sense is like we absolutely need

1453
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,820
a government that does a much better job

1454
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:23,900
than our current government does

1455
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:25,900
with providing for our basic needs,

1456
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:27,980
but we also need roses and we,

1457
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:30,140
I don't know that we can necessarily assume

1458
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:32,540
that our government will have the means

1459
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:34,780
or the priorities that allow for that.

1460
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:37,820
And philanthropy has the flexibility to do that

1461
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:39,500
if it does so in proper deference

1462
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,940
to the authorities of our government.

1463
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:44,740
And so let's talk about that deference.

1464
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:46,500
Deference to the authorities of our government,

1465
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,980
meaning in the case of Akron,

1466
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:51,940
the democratically elected school board,

1467
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:56,220
probably the parent associations, PTAs, whatever,

1468
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:58,140
all the various community organs

1469
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:00,300
that know what is needed there.

1470
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:02,020
Right, all the things that make it

1471
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:04,020
very ineffective altruism, right?

1472
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:05,900
Like all of these kinds of these,

1473
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:08,940
there are relationships of friction and negotiation

1474
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:11,900
and solidarity and just juncture

1475
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:13,980
that have to be contested.

1476
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:16,740
They have to be like democratically contested.

1477
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:18,540
That's what it means to be in relationship,

1478
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:20,900
but you're doing so with a sense

1479
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:22,420
that like you are ultimately there

1480
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:26,060
to help provide the things that keep people human,

1481
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:27,460
the things that bring them joy,

1482
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:29,540
the things that really connect them to one another.

1483
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:31,540
And so there's a humility to that

1484
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:33,060
and a clear sense of purpose.

1485
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:36,900
Yes, and especially when you are in deference

1486
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:40,260
to the organizations within the government

1487
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:43,060
that are specifically democratic,

1488
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:44,620
that are coming from the bottom up.

1489
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:45,780
And when I was saying,

1490
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:47,220
hey, a lot of the stuff in the budget

1491
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:49,180
of the federal government I don't like,

1492
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:51,220
a lot of that is driven by the parts

1493
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:52,340
that are not democratic.

1494
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:54,940
That's driven by corporations having too much power

1495
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:57,340
and the people not having enough power.

1496
00:59:57,340 --> 01:00:00,620
And if we instead are working in deference

1497
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:03,860
to the parts of the government that are democratic,

1498
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:04,980
where the people do have a voice,

1499
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:06,460
then we're on the right path maybe.

1500
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:08,140
I think we are, I think we are.

1501
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:09,740
So for this Giving Tuesday.

1502
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:10,580
Yes.

1503
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:14,980
If people, you know, around this time of year,

1504
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:17,820
I do think about how fortunate I am

1505
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:20,100
to be doing a podcast and YouTube videos

1506
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:22,180
and to have a little bit of disposable income.

1507
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:27,180
And I want to make sure that I am sharing it with others

1508
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:28,820
and making the world a better place

1509
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:30,260
in ways that matter to me.

1510
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:33,220
What do you suggest that people, you know,

1511
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:34,380
think about where they start

1512
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:36,100
with their own philanthropic activities

1513
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:37,740
to make sure they're not falling into these?

1514
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:39,380
Because again, I spent five years

1515
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:40,820
following the effective altruists.

1516
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:43,020
And I don't mind that my money went to bed nets,

1517
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:46,060
but now I'm like, I could have done a little better.

1518
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:48,220
There's a balance to strike between giving

1519
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:49,220
for the world we have

1520
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:51,580
and giving for the world we want to build, right?

1521
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:54,780
So I would never say like just give

1522
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:58,300
to these sort of evergreen pursuits of culture

1523
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:00,220
and recreation and parks

1524
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:02,500
because that might feel tone deaf

1525
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:06,860
based on the serious local international crises

1526
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:07,980
that we find ourselves in.

1527
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:10,180
So I don't want to be absolutist about this,

1528
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:12,820
but I would say if anything strive for a balance

1529
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:17,620
between being responsive to the world that we have

1530
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:21,740
and responsive to genuine vulnerability

1531
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:25,140
and genuine crisis that is readily accessible

1532
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:27,300
to all of us if we look around,

1533
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:29,820
but also consider what can you give

1534
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:31,260
and where can you give

1535
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:34,340
that keeps you in relationship with others

1536
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:37,780
that allows you and others to gather, to explore,

1537
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:40,180
to flourish, to grow and connect.

1538
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:41,980
What institutions can you give

1539
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:44,300
that might be locally, they might be nationally,

1540
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:46,500
but what can you do that kind of fosters

1541
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:48,020
human flourishing with your giving?

1542
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:51,260
Do you have an example or even one from your own life

1543
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:54,060
of something like that sort of local thing

1544
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:56,500
that folks can be in partnership with?

1545
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:57,500
Absolutely.

1546
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:01,940
So again, in New York, I support my community garden.

1547
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:03,460
That's a small thing.

1548
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:08,220
I also support museums ranging from ones that are,

1549
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:10,580
the name brands that might be like the Met

1550
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:11,700
or the Brooklyn Museum.

1551
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:14,300
And I especially give to those

1552
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:17,300
that are freely accessible to others,

1553
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:20,140
that really allow for free admission

1554
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:22,260
because that feels the most sort of democratic

1555
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:27,060
and inclusive way of sharing that quality of life with others.

1556
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:28,620
I have been on the board

1557
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:30,500
of some men called the Chautauqua Institution,

1558
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:31,620
the Young People's Board.

1559
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:32,980
That's a place I grew up going

1560
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:35,300
that really fostered these values in me.

1561
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:37,460
I come from Cleveland, not far from Akron.

1562
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:40,300
So shout out to Northeast Ohio.

1563
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:45,300
And so I would give to local social service organizations

1564
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:47,660
there and also to museums there.

1565
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:50,300
And I should say like not just ones that are,

1566
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:53,020
again, those name brands, but maybe smaller ones.

1567
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:55,860
They might be local things that work with the schools.

1568
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:58,620
They might be a dance troupe

1569
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:01,380
that meets at your local community center

1570
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:04,580
that people really value or a recreation center.

1571
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:06,780
Again, stuff that brings people together

1572
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:09,260
in a way that I think is missing so much of the time.

1573
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:12,020
And in terms of building worker power

1574
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:14,220
or power for average people like that,

1575
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:15,060
we were talking about,

1576
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:16,660
wouldn't it be great if Mackenzie Scott

1577
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:18,140
donated organizations like that?

1578
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:20,580
What sort of organizations are you thinking of

1579
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:22,980
and how do people go about finding them?

1580
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:25,380
Well, first of all, I would say definitely look

1581
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:28,260
and see if there are workers on strike

1582
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:29,860
and just give to those strike funds.

1583
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:32,780
That's definitely a great place to start.

1584
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:35,700
The strike funds that the union asks you to donate to,

1585
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:36,540
very important.

1586
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:37,380
That's a great point.

1587
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:39,660
If you want to support a strike,

1588
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:42,820
you have to look at how is the union asking you to support

1589
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:45,380
because sometimes there'll be other funds around the edges

1590
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:49,020
that are not really, you defer to the union, right?

1591
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:51,660
Yeah, I agree completely.

1592
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:53,780
And so the nonprofits that I mentioned before

1593
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:58,540
that I think are really smart about translating advocacy

1594
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:03,540
on behalf of the workers and the sort of populists

1595
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:06,940
of the United States are really great.

1596
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:08,100
That would be demand progress.

1597
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:10,180
That would be Americans for financial reform.

1598
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:12,860
They're really good at translating demands of the people

1599
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:13,980
into real policy.

1600
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:15,900
So those would be my other recommendations there.

1601
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:19,020
I'll tell you my own part from my donations this year

1602
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:24,020
is I've given to the Emergency Workers Organizing Committee,

1603
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:26,180
collective, I forget which,

1604
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:30,420
which is a group that anybody around the country can call

1605
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:31,700
and get connected with an organizer

1606
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:33,180
if you're trying to unionize.

1607
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:35,180
EWALK, really great organization

1608
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:38,460
that comes out of a union effort.

1609
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:42,700
And I am looking for a trans-legal defense charity

1610
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:45,220
because that's, I think, a very important legal issue

1611
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:47,980
right now and those are folks who are really doing

1612
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:52,500
the very basic on-the-ground legal and political work

1613
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:55,260
to get some of the folks who need power built

1614
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:58,620
in our society, most the power that they need.

1615
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:01,980
But I'm looking to, as you say,

1616
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:05,540
find a place that I can have a relationship with

1617
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:08,180
where it's not just like, oh, hey, I'm, you know,

1618
01:05:08,180 --> 01:05:10,100
take the money and run or whatever,

1619
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:12,780
but like, you know, where are the places

1620
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:16,100
that are working most closely in their own community?

1621
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:20,500
Not just doing the parachuting in like top-down work,

1622
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:23,020
but, you know, actually providing legal aid

1623
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:25,060
to folks who need it, you know?

1624
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:25,900
I do.

1625
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:29,260
And I totally second that recommendation.

1626
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:32,300
And I think that will sort of require listeners

1627
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:34,940
to look in their own communities.

1628
01:05:34,940 --> 01:05:35,780
Yes, exactly.

1629
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:38,380
And kind of just use your sort of embedded networks

1630
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:40,500
and your embedded knowledge about, you know,

1631
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:43,940
where do you feel things are really making a difference

1632
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:46,500
in helping people flourish in the place where you live.

1633
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:48,140
That's so wonderful.

1634
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:51,020
