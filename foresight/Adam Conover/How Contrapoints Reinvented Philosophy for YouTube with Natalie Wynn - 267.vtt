00:00.000 --> 00:02.440
Hello and welcome to Factually, I'm Adam Conover.

00:02.440 --> 00:04.760
Thank you so much for joining me on the show again.

00:04.760 --> 00:07.720
I am so excited for today's episode.

00:07.720 --> 00:10.440
We have on the show today a guest I have wanted to have

00:10.440 --> 00:11.720
on the show for years.

00:11.720 --> 00:14.480
And frankly, one of the people I most admire

00:14.480 --> 00:17.520
working on the internet or really in all of media today.

00:17.520 --> 00:20.800
I first saw a video from the YouTube channel ContraPoints

00:20.800 --> 00:23.240
five years ago in my trailer while I was working

00:23.240 --> 00:25.800
on one of the last seasons of Adam Ruins Everything.

00:25.800 --> 00:29.120
And this video blew me the fuck away.

00:29.200 --> 00:32.320
It was brilliant, it was fiendishly funny, it was stylish,

00:32.320 --> 00:34.800
and it was unlike anything I had ever seen

00:34.800 --> 00:36.400
on the platform before.

00:36.400 --> 00:39.760
In just 30 minutes, Natalie Wynn, the host of ContraPoints,

00:39.760 --> 00:41.720
explained the right-wing psychologist

00:41.720 --> 00:43.760
and self-help guru, Jordan Peterson,

00:43.760 --> 00:47.040
better than any piece of media I had ever come across.

00:47.040 --> 00:49.880
And from then on, every single one of her videos

00:49.880 --> 00:51.800
became a must-watch for me.

00:51.800 --> 00:54.240
What is so impressive about Natalie's work

00:54.240 --> 00:56.960
is that she doesn't just repackage other people's thoughts

00:56.960 --> 00:58.600
like so many people do on YouTube.

00:58.600 --> 01:02.000
No, she delivers original philosophical insight

01:02.000 --> 01:04.800
and analysis that is genuinely new.

01:04.800 --> 01:08.080
But rather than deliver that in a lecture room or a book,

01:08.080 --> 01:10.800
she puts them into video essays on YouTube

01:10.800 --> 01:12.560
that are watched massively.

01:12.560 --> 01:16.160
Her work has won her nearly 1.8 million YouTube followers

01:16.160 --> 01:18.920
and she has also won a Peabody Award.

01:18.920 --> 01:21.880
Her work is genuinely a new form of media,

01:21.880 --> 01:25.360
serious philosophical work watched by millions

01:25.360 --> 01:27.480
on the biggest platform imaginable.

01:27.480 --> 01:30.200
And I could not be more excited to have her

01:30.200 --> 01:31.560
on the show today.

01:31.560 --> 01:33.360
But before we get into it, I just wanna remind you

01:33.360 --> 01:34.920

And now let's get to my interview

01:58.800 --> 02:01.520
with the writer, thinker, philosopher and YouTuber,

02:01.520 --> 02:04.360
Natalie Nguyen, also known as ContraPoints.

02:07.040 --> 02:08.800
Natalie, thank you so much for being on the show.

02:08.800 --> 02:10.200
I'm thrilled to have you.

02:10.200 --> 02:11.040
Thank you so much.

02:11.040 --> 02:12.240
I am very happy to be here.

02:12.240 --> 02:14.000
I've wanted to have you on the show for years.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.560
You're probably one of my favorite,

02:16.560 --> 02:19.480
what do I call you, internet public intellectuals?

02:19.480 --> 02:22.760
Like, what do you call yourself?

02:22.760 --> 02:24.360
I guess I worry that public intellectuals

02:24.360 --> 02:25.680
sets me up for failure.

02:25.680 --> 02:27.760
But I'm gonna call myself a YouTuber

02:27.760 --> 02:32.000
because why get more complicated than it needs to be?

02:32.000 --> 02:36.120
But yeah, I make video essays on YouTube.

02:36.120 --> 02:39.040
I've been doing that since 2016 or so.

02:39.040 --> 02:44.040
And cover a lot of topics from politics to sexuality

02:44.440 --> 02:48.720
to psychology, I guess I'll even cover.

02:48.720 --> 02:51.560
So it's pretty broad, I guess,

02:51.560 --> 02:53.520
in terms of what I'll go into.

02:53.520 --> 02:55.200
But yeah, the channel is called ContraPoints.

02:55.200 --> 02:58.640
And I feel like we have something in common in that.

02:58.640 --> 03:01.160
I have said many times on this show,

03:01.160 --> 03:03.160
I intended to go to grad school for philosophy.

03:03.160 --> 03:04.160
I never did.

03:04.160 --> 03:06.280
And it's been a thorn in my side ever since.

03:06.280 --> 03:09.080
I have a shameful bachelor's.

03:09.080 --> 03:10.720
You went for a number of years and left.

03:10.720 --> 03:13.120
And now both here we are on YouTube,

03:13.120 --> 03:16.560
trying to maybe use some of these ideas

03:16.560 --> 03:17.880
in the public sphere,

03:17.880 --> 03:21.240
but you do it on such an incredibly deep level.

03:21.240 --> 03:24.400
Your new video, which has the title Twilight,

03:24.400 --> 03:27.040
that's the entire title.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.280
But in the video, you cover everything

03:29.280 --> 03:33.640
from the nature of desire to sadomasochism,

03:33.640 --> 03:36.200
to radical feminism,

03:36.200 --> 03:40.280
and you end with this incredible insight

03:40.280 --> 03:43.280
about the nature of the masculine and feminine,

03:43.280 --> 03:45.520
and then containing each other.

03:45.520 --> 03:47.760
And watching it, I'm like,

03:47.760 --> 03:50.960
having every single sentence in the video,

03:50.960 --> 03:52.600
it gives me a little mind explosion

03:52.720 --> 03:54.120
of a new insider thought

03:54.120 --> 03:56.160
that I'm processing with everything else.

03:56.160 --> 03:58.080
They're incredibly dense.

03:58.080 --> 04:00.160
It's just such an amazing work

04:00.160 --> 04:04.760
to go all the way from Twilight to that big concept.

04:04.760 --> 04:07.240
Like, how do you even begin to put together

04:07.240 --> 04:08.080
a video like that?

04:08.080 --> 04:09.560
What's the first germ of it?

04:09.560 --> 04:10.720
Well, I think with this video,

04:10.720 --> 04:13.760
I knew I wanted to make a video about sexuality,

04:13.760 --> 04:15.960
but to do that on YouTube,

04:15.960 --> 04:19.280
I was in search of a PG-13 framing device.

04:19.280 --> 04:20.880
And so Twilight kind of became,

04:20.880 --> 04:22.800
I was like, okay, if I want to talk about sexuality,

04:22.800 --> 04:25.120
but I want to do it on YouTube,

04:25.120 --> 04:27.000
the community guidelines will just love

04:27.000 --> 04:28.440
if this video is about Twilight

04:28.440 --> 04:30.360
instead of being about something more explicit.

04:30.360 --> 04:33.920
So, and also, I've been alive long enough

04:33.920 --> 04:35.480
to have sat through, at this point,

04:35.480 --> 04:38.200
20 years of discourse about the Twilight series.

04:38.200 --> 04:40.240
So it's something that I'm very familiar with.

04:40.240 --> 04:41.920
A lot of the complicated conversations

04:41.920 --> 04:43.840
people have about sexuality

04:43.840 --> 04:48.640
have been sort of magnetized to this topic in particular.

04:48.680 --> 04:50.040
So, you know, a lot of the things

04:50.040 --> 04:51.600
that people worry about with Twilight,

04:51.600 --> 04:55.240
the kind of power dynamics and the sort of,

04:55.240 --> 04:57.840
I guess, people worry about misogyny and all this,

04:57.840 --> 05:00.720
I guess, stuff I wanted to go into in the video.

05:00.720 --> 05:02.640
And so for me, Twilight was just like,

05:02.640 --> 05:04.880
I just felt this was like the right case study

05:04.880 --> 05:08.480
that I could attach all these wider issues to.

05:08.480 --> 05:09.960
That's amazing.

05:09.960 --> 05:11.720
And one of the things that's amazing about this video

05:11.720 --> 05:14.320
is it has almost four million views on YouTube.

05:14.320 --> 05:17.080
And, you know, some of your previous works,

05:17.080 --> 05:19.800
you know, say you did a video about Jordan Peterson, right?

05:19.800 --> 05:21.520
That's a wonderful, I think, philosophical,

05:21.520 --> 05:23.200
that's the first thing I ever saw of yours.

05:23.200 --> 05:26.400
And it was really influenced the way that I think about

05:26.400 --> 05:29.600
that guy and that entire movement in, you know,

05:29.600 --> 05:31.680
pseudo-intellectual circles.

05:31.680 --> 05:33.720
But, you know, that's a hot topic for the algorithm, right?

05:33.720 --> 05:35.400
Jordan Peterson does well.

05:35.400 --> 05:37.240
Twilight, if the words Jordan Peterson

05:37.240 --> 05:39.120
are in the title of the video, it'll do well.

05:39.120 --> 05:41.360
This video is about a, you know,

05:41.360 --> 05:44.120
a couple decade old romance series.

05:44.120 --> 05:46.720
And the topic ranges so widely

05:46.720 --> 05:49.200
from the nature of romance fiction all the way to, you know,

05:49.200 --> 05:51.680
the nature of desire and sexuality itself.

05:51.680 --> 05:54.200
And people are watching it in such huge numbers.

05:54.200 --> 05:55.880
What do you, like, attribute that to?

05:55.880 --> 05:58.120
Because, again, it's a really dense,

05:58.120 --> 06:00.240
like truly philosophical work.

06:00.240 --> 06:02.760
Well, I think people are curious about these topics.

06:02.760 --> 06:04.880
And I feel like a lot of times the discourse about them

06:04.880 --> 06:07.000
is of a pretty low quality.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.720
So I feel like this is another thing

06:08.720 --> 06:11.120
that attracted me to this topic is that I felt like,

06:11.120 --> 06:12.480
I feel like that there's stuff

06:12.480 --> 06:15.920
that's not being said about this that I can say.

06:15.960 --> 06:17.760
So, you know, I try to look for something like that

06:17.760 --> 06:19.240
when I'm deciding on a video topic.

06:19.240 --> 06:20.800
If it's something that I feel like a lot of people

06:20.800 --> 06:23.280
are covering really, really well, then I'll, like,

06:23.280 --> 06:25.400
well, I don't know if I can add anything to this,

06:25.400 --> 06:27.840
but with this, I felt like I had something to add.

06:29.120 --> 06:31.800
And yeah, I mean, I guess one reason

06:31.800 --> 06:36.920
I decided to make this video is as a LGBT person,

06:36.920 --> 06:39.040
I feel like, well, I'm a trans woman.

06:39.040 --> 06:42.040
I'm not LGBT and T, but you know what I mean.

06:43.480 --> 06:45.720
I feel like people like me were very frequently

06:45.720 --> 06:47.920
asked these days to, like, provide, like,

06:47.920 --> 06:50.200
to explain ourselves, like, explain your sexuality.

06:50.200 --> 06:51.680
Why are people gay? Why are people trans?

06:51.680 --> 06:54.400
Why are people, and, like, I've spent some time on YouTube

06:54.400 --> 06:56.080
trying to do exactly that.

06:56.080 --> 06:58.800
But I feel like, what I came to realize is, like,

06:58.800 --> 06:59.840
we're trying to understand,

06:59.840 --> 07:01.680
is people are trying to understand why people are gay

07:01.680 --> 07:02.880
or why people are trans.

07:02.880 --> 07:04.440
And no one even really understands

07:04.440 --> 07:06.240
heterosexuality very well yet.

07:06.240 --> 07:08.080
So it's like, why are we trying to do calculus

07:08.080 --> 07:10.160
before we've figured out arithmetic?

07:10.160 --> 07:13.320
So, in a way, I think the, which,

07:13.360 --> 07:16.280
finally, I want to do a video about heterosexuality, right?

07:16.280 --> 07:17.560
It's like, before we start talking,

07:17.560 --> 07:18.960
before we get really complicated with this

07:18.960 --> 07:21.320
and start talking about the sexuality of, you know,

07:21.320 --> 07:23.400
trans people, like, why don't we figure out how, like,

07:23.400 --> 07:27.400
this, the, you know, a Mormon housewife's sexuality works

07:27.400 --> 07:28.720
in the case of Stephanie Meyer, right?

07:28.720 --> 07:31.800
Because I feel like we haven't even kind of cracked that code.

07:31.800 --> 07:34.680
So I guess I felt this was, like,

07:34.680 --> 07:37.960
maybe a better introductory place for people

07:37.960 --> 07:39.280
to start thinking about sexuality

07:39.280 --> 07:42.160
than for, like, demanding that marginalized people

07:42.160 --> 07:44.840
explain themselves to, to people who kind of

07:44.840 --> 07:47.120
don't even have the tools needed to,

07:47.120 --> 07:48.800
to understand it in the first place.

07:48.800 --> 07:49.640
That's so funny.

07:49.640 --> 07:51.680
Well, it's such a funny flip of the request too.

07:51.680 --> 07:54.240
Hey, a queer person, explain yourselves to us.

07:54.240 --> 07:56.040
Well, no, how about me, a queer person,

07:56.040 --> 07:57.880
ask what the hell is up with you people?

07:57.880 --> 07:58.880
Yeah, exactly.

07:58.880 --> 08:01.280
What is up with, your media is really weird.

08:01.280 --> 08:03.160
I mean, because heterosexuality, I mean, sometimes,

08:03.160 --> 08:04.960
you know, people might frame heterosexuality

08:04.960 --> 08:06.640
as like boring or vanilla or whatever.

08:06.640 --> 08:09.320
I mean, heterosexuality is actually extremely complicated,

08:09.320 --> 08:10.160
right?

08:10.600 --> 08:12.560
And you notice this, like, and it's also

08:12.560 --> 08:14.440
something that I think most queer people,

08:14.440 --> 08:17.320
we, you know, we all kind of grew up

08:17.320 --> 08:20.680
being taught how to do heterosexuality in a way, right?

08:20.680 --> 08:24.320
So it's kind of the default that all of us are sort of used to.

08:24.320 --> 08:26.880
And most, I think, a lot of gay people, even,

08:26.880 --> 08:30.240
like, we kind of form our sexuality in response

08:30.240 --> 08:33.920
to heterosexuality, in a sense, or sort of as a modification

08:33.920 --> 08:36.000
of tropes that come from heterosexuality.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.120
So I don't know whether you're taught.

08:38.120 --> 08:40.720
Obviously, this all gets pretty controversial

08:40.720 --> 08:42.320
with in-community stuff that we probably

08:42.320 --> 08:43.320
don't want to get into here.

08:43.320 --> 08:46.240
But, you know, with terms like top and bottom

08:46.240 --> 08:49.880
and or butch and femme, like, these terms are not

08:49.880 --> 08:51.400
the same as heterosexuality, right?

08:51.400 --> 08:54.000
These dynamics are not literally heterosexuality,

08:54.000 --> 08:56.080
but they obviously have some kind of resemblance

08:56.080 --> 08:58.680
to the kind of tropes that we sort of expect

08:58.680 --> 09:02.360
of a, you know, a kind of dominant active man

09:02.360 --> 09:05.840
and sort of submissive, maybe passive woman.

09:05.840 --> 09:08.400
That's kind of the stereotype of heterosexuality.

09:08.400 --> 09:10.800
It certainly comes up a lot in romance fiction,

09:10.800 --> 09:11.640
including Twilight.

09:11.640 --> 09:14.760
So I felt like that was kind of an interesting place

09:14.760 --> 09:17.160
to start with discussing sexuality as just like,

09:17.160 --> 09:21.840
well, let's look at what's considered to be normal

09:21.840 --> 09:25.920
and see how actually complicated and strange

09:25.920 --> 09:27.240
the normal thing is.

09:27.240 --> 09:29.840
Well, I found that fascinating because I am heterosexual,

09:29.840 --> 09:31.480
or at least mostly heterosexual.

09:31.480 --> 09:32.640
We're all a work in progress.

09:32.640 --> 09:36.920
But, you know, heterosexuality, also all of those norms

09:36.920 --> 09:39.000
and tropes were like imposed upon me.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
And sometimes, you know, I found myself,

09:41.000 --> 09:43.560
especially in the part of life I am now going like,

09:43.560 --> 09:45.520
wait, what are those things?

09:45.520 --> 09:47.320
What, you know, are those part of me?

09:47.320 --> 09:49.960
Or were those things that were imposed, right?

09:49.960 --> 09:53.720
And so hearing you unpack desire, the nature of desire,

09:53.720 --> 09:56.360
submission, dominance, masculinity, femininity

09:56.360 --> 09:58.640
is incredibly fascinating.

09:58.640 --> 10:03.400
You have this concept that you keep going back to DHSM

10:03.400 --> 10:04.720
in the video over and over again.

10:04.720 --> 10:07.360
Can you tell us a little bit about what you mean by that?

10:07.360 --> 10:09.600
And for folks who haven't seen the video, go watch it.

10:09.600 --> 10:12.240
But, you know, I'd love to give them a little bit of taste

10:12.240 --> 10:13.480
of what the themes are here.

10:13.480 --> 10:14.320
Sure, yeah.

10:14.320 --> 10:16.640
DHSM is an acronym that I made up

10:16.640 --> 10:19.880
for default heterosexual satomasticism.

10:19.880 --> 10:22.560
I was thinking of like BDSM and then I'll just make a,

10:22.560 --> 10:25.760
you know, corresponding acronym that describes what I see

10:25.760 --> 10:29.360
as the kind of assumed satomasticism

10:29.360 --> 10:31.200
of normative heterosexuality.

10:31.200 --> 10:33.720
So, you know, we're all familiar with,

10:33.720 --> 10:36.280
with like heterosexual dating rituals, basically,

10:36.280 --> 10:38.160
where it's kind of expected that a man is going

10:38.160 --> 10:40.440
to take initiative and that a man is going to be more dominant

10:40.440 --> 10:44.040
is going to kind of, you know, lead in the dance of dating,

10:44.040 --> 10:46.280
right, essentially, and also of sex.

10:46.280 --> 10:51.040
And I think that there's a whole complicated series

10:51.040 --> 10:53.520
of power dynamics baked into these assumptions,

10:53.560 --> 10:55.360
where it's assumed that sort of, you know,

10:55.360 --> 10:57.920
you could take things like voyeurism, exhibitionism.

10:57.920 --> 10:59.640
It's assumed that men like to look

10:59.640 --> 11:01.360
and women like to be looked at.

11:01.360 --> 11:05.120
It's assumed that, you know, men pursue

11:05.120 --> 11:06.800
and women are pursued.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.920
All kinds of dynamics like that, you know,

11:09.920 --> 11:11.760
in the video I have a whole list of these,

11:11.760 --> 11:15.160
these binaries that basically are included.

11:15.160 --> 11:19.080
But I guess one of the questions is like, well,

11:19.080 --> 11:22.320
why is this, is this the, is this the project,

11:22.320 --> 11:24.280
basically, of patriarchal conditioning?

11:24.280 --> 11:27.560
Or is there something inherent to human sexuality itself

11:27.560 --> 11:29.280
that involves these binaries?

11:30.200 --> 11:33.560
And so all of that stuff that I try to explore.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.240
And explore through the lens of Twilight,

11:35.240 --> 11:38.280
where all of these things are present,

11:38.280 --> 11:40.640
which is part of the controversy about Twilight, right?

11:40.640 --> 11:42.840
That it's putatively for children,

11:42.840 --> 11:44.360
or at least for young adults.

11:44.360 --> 11:47.960
And yet it has these themes of dominant submission,

11:48.000 --> 11:53.000
sadism, masochism, which feel like really inherently sexual

11:54.280 --> 11:55.680
and confusing to a lot of people,

11:55.680 --> 11:57.160
especially when it's like in the form

11:57.160 --> 11:58.680
of very popular fiction.

11:58.680 --> 12:00.680
And watching it, I literally just watched Twilight

12:00.680 --> 12:03.080
last night, unrelatedly, it was not quite researched,

12:03.080 --> 12:05.080
but it certainly served well as it.

12:05.080 --> 12:07.720
And yeah, I mean, that stuff is in the movie

12:07.720 --> 12:12.480
and in a very like stark, almost blunt way.

12:12.480 --> 12:14.800
Yeah, I think it's interesting how,

12:14.800 --> 12:19.200
because heterosexuality is considered so socially normal,

12:19.200 --> 12:22.000
like you can get away with like a shocking amount

12:22.000 --> 12:26.240
of like weird sex stuff in like young adult media,

12:26.240 --> 12:28.840
as long as you keep it as you keep it hetero, right?

12:28.840 --> 12:32.200
And Twilight definitely pushes that as far as it can.

12:33.280 --> 12:36.360
Obviously, like there was a decade ago,

12:36.360 --> 12:38.920
a controversy erupted around the Twilight fan fiction,

12:38.920 --> 12:41.560
50 Shades of Grey, which is explicitly

12:41.560 --> 12:44.760
a kind of sadomasochistic romance novel

12:44.760 --> 12:48.120
where, I mean, what E.L. James, the author of 50 Shades did,

12:48.120 --> 12:50.320
basically is just pick up on all those themes

12:50.320 --> 12:52.640
that are already present in Twilight

12:52.640 --> 12:55.720
and kind of make explicit what was implicit in Twilight.

12:55.720 --> 12:59.680
So in Twilight, the plot is about a male vampire, Edward,

12:59.680 --> 13:02.440
who falls in love with a human girl, Bella,

13:02.440 --> 13:07.440
and obviously part of the kind of sex appeal of vampires

13:07.920 --> 13:10.600
does have to do with this hierarchical dominance, right?

13:10.600 --> 13:12.120
The vampire is usually old,

13:12.120 --> 13:14.320
is usually there's undertones of violence

13:14.320 --> 13:16.120
with the fangs and blood drinking.

13:16.120 --> 13:18.920
Rich lives in a big castle, right?

13:18.920 --> 13:21.240
Wearing cloaks everywhere, wealthy man.

13:21.240 --> 13:23.400
Yeah, it's inherently associated with like,

13:23.400 --> 13:25.520
there's a few working class vampires, Lost Boys,

13:25.520 --> 13:28.800
but usually it's, we're talking about an aristocrat, right?

13:28.800 --> 13:29.640
Yeah.

13:29.640 --> 13:32.280
Someone who's sort of overwhelmingly powerful

13:32.280 --> 13:36.600
and that seems to be intertwined with why people find

13:36.600 --> 13:39.280
something sort of sexually enticing about vampires.

13:39.280 --> 13:41.600
It is the danger and the power itself.

13:41.600 --> 13:46.080
So the question is like, isn't it kind of disturbing, right?

13:46.080 --> 13:49.000
That like, we have millions of teenage readers

13:49.000 --> 13:50.520
who seem to be so attracted to this

13:50.520 --> 13:52.320
and like, what kind of message is this sending?

13:52.320 --> 13:54.040
Well, before we can even answer that,

13:54.040 --> 13:57.120
you have to unpack why this kind of thing is appealing

13:57.120 --> 13:59.120
to so many people in the first place.

13:59.120 --> 14:00.480
And why do you think it's appealing

14:00.480 --> 14:01.800
to so many people in the first place?

14:01.800 --> 14:04.560
I think for a bunch of different reasons.

14:04.560 --> 14:07.600
I definitely, I'm certainly not dismissive

14:07.600 --> 14:09.320
of the feminist arguments about this,

14:09.320 --> 14:13.880
which are that, you know, if you are a woman or a girl

14:13.880 --> 14:15.160
and you're raised in this society,

14:15.160 --> 14:18.360
where you're kind of conditioned almost to like romanticize

14:18.360 --> 14:22.120
a certain type of dynamic between men and women,

14:22.120 --> 14:24.880
that sort of is the result of a long history

14:24.880 --> 14:27.080
of men having social power over women.

14:27.080 --> 14:28.880
So even in historical romance novels,

14:28.880 --> 14:31.240
like Pride and Prejudice, right?

14:31.240 --> 14:32.920
In Pride and Prejudice, you have Darcy,

14:32.920 --> 14:35.720
this like extremely wealthy man who's,

14:35.720 --> 14:37.120
at first he's kind of an asshole,

14:37.160 --> 14:39.720
and then Elizabeth who needs, you know,

14:39.720 --> 14:42.200
because of the situation of her family, she needs the money,

14:42.200 --> 14:44.000
but she also wants a marriage of love.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.080
And so in Pride and Prejudice, you know,

14:47.080 --> 14:50.040
the appeal of this power dynamic seems to derive in part

14:50.040 --> 14:52.240
from like the economics of the situation,

14:52.240 --> 14:55.480
where it's like as a woman in the early 19th century,

14:55.480 --> 14:58.160
you kind of have your economic fate

14:58.160 --> 15:00.560
is intertwined with who you marry.

15:00.560 --> 15:03.120
So it's not just, it's not,

15:03.120 --> 15:04.680
it's hard to look at something like that

15:04.680 --> 15:06.240
and be like, oh, this is just nature, right?

15:06.680 --> 15:08.320
Women are just naturally attracted to powerful men.

15:08.320 --> 15:10.400
It's like, well, women have always been put

15:10.400 --> 15:13.000
in these situations where they kind of need men

15:13.000 --> 15:13.960
to provide for them.

15:13.960 --> 15:17.160
So yeah, under those conditions, obviously,

15:17.160 --> 15:19.720
most women are going to do the rationally self-interested thing

15:19.720 --> 15:23.840
of pursuing a man who is the only plausible route

15:23.840 --> 15:25.840
that they have to economic stability

15:25.840 --> 15:27.640
and to any kind of power, right?

15:28.640 --> 15:30.680
But I also think that, you know,

15:30.680 --> 15:34.320
the kind of SM, pseudo-masochistic dynamic

15:34.320 --> 15:36.320
has something to it that kind of transcends

15:36.320 --> 15:40.280
just the economic appeal, which is,

15:40.280 --> 15:43.600
I think that there's something about sexuality,

15:43.600 --> 15:45.360
about desire in general,

15:45.360 --> 15:50.360
that kind of likes sort of barriers and overcoming,

15:50.960 --> 15:52.480
you know, overcoming barriers.

15:52.480 --> 15:57.480
So I think one thing that I think about a lot with Twilight

15:57.480 --> 16:02.000
is, you know, when you have this like hunter and prey,

16:02.000 --> 16:06.160
predator-prey dynamic, I think that, you know,

16:06.160 --> 16:10.880
poetry is often described as love, as like a hunt, right?

16:10.880 --> 16:13.320
And there's, you know, it's a motif

16:13.320 --> 16:15.760
that goes like way back into the ancient world.

16:15.760 --> 16:19.480
You know, you can think of myths like Hades and Persephone,

16:19.480 --> 16:24.080
where, you know, you have, I think that when you,

16:24.080 --> 16:26.440
desire often feels like pursuit, right?

16:26.440 --> 16:31.440
And so I think that the metaphor goes kind of,

16:32.000 --> 16:34.600
deeper than just economic imbalance.

16:34.600 --> 16:37.680
I do think that the reason why it's so disproportionately

16:37.680 --> 16:42.280
seems to be, you know, when people create romantic fantasies,

16:42.280 --> 16:45.560
the reason why it's usually a man pursuing a woman,

16:45.560 --> 16:48.600
I think that is largely social and economic,

16:48.600 --> 16:51.240
but I think that someone pursuing someone,

16:51.240 --> 16:53.440
that I think goes deeper, yeah.

16:53.440 --> 16:55.960
Right, there's a deeper like pattern

16:55.960 --> 16:59.520
in human sexuality or psychology or behavior

16:59.560 --> 17:02.160
that needs some kind of disparity,

17:02.160 --> 17:05.320
some kind of block in the way.

17:05.320 --> 17:08.080
I mean, you talk in the video about how, you know,

17:08.080 --> 17:11.480
desire, you can specifically only desire something

17:11.480 --> 17:15.200
that you do not have, that once you acquire it,

17:15.200 --> 17:17.120
the desire dissipates to some degree,

17:17.120 --> 17:18.640
that that's the nature of it.

17:18.640 --> 17:20.600
And so you need those impediments.

17:20.600 --> 17:23.000
You also say that, I just wrote down this quote

17:23.000 --> 17:26.640
from the video, equality like wisdom is not exciting.

17:27.080 --> 17:30.680
That if Twilight had been a, there's a power dynamic,

17:30.680 --> 17:32.360
oh no, we don't want power dynamics

17:32.360 --> 17:36.120
in our real relationships, one might say.

17:36.120 --> 17:37.520
But a perfectly equal relationship

17:37.520 --> 17:39.680
between Edward and Bella would not be necessarily

17:39.680 --> 17:40.760
worth writing a book about,

17:40.760 --> 17:43.600
nor might it be sexy to encounter in real life,

17:43.600 --> 17:46.120
like that sort of perfect, what do you,

17:46.120 --> 17:47.200
could you expand on that?

17:47.200 --> 17:50.440
Well, I think that you could certainly make,

17:50.440 --> 17:53.480
you know, a egalitarian relationship exciting in fiction,

17:53.480 --> 17:55.560
but the way that you do that was be to put

17:55.640 --> 17:57.920
other kinds of barriers in the way.

17:57.920 --> 17:59.600
So, I mean, I guess you, you look at something

17:59.600 --> 18:01.920
like Romeo and Juliet was an obvious example

18:01.920 --> 18:03.200
where Romeo and Juliet are, I guess,

18:03.200 --> 18:05.320
more or less socially equal, although, you know,

18:05.320 --> 18:08.240
as like medieval man and woman, not really,

18:08.240 --> 18:11.040
but still like there's not quite the class element

18:11.040 --> 18:13.800
that there is in, say, Pride and Prejudice or in Twilight,

18:13.800 --> 18:16.480
but as a result of that, other barriers

18:16.480 --> 18:17.400
have to be involved, right?

18:17.400 --> 18:21.640
Their families are feuding and that as this dangerous,

18:21.640 --> 18:24.960
almost like in this case, deadly element to their romance,

18:24.960 --> 18:27.480
right, is that they are kind of risking everything

18:27.480 --> 18:28.880
for each other.

18:28.880 --> 18:29.720
There's different ways, I think,

18:29.720 --> 18:32.120
for an artist to accomplish that,

18:32.120 --> 18:35.320
but people do seem to find the danger of it exciting, right?

18:35.320 --> 18:37.840
And you can, and you can create that through

18:37.840 --> 18:40.880
the kind of vampire hierarchy, whereas like one person

18:40.880 --> 18:44.680
is sort of overwhelmingly dangerous to the other person,

18:44.680 --> 18:47.000
or you can create it through like social circumstances

18:47.000 --> 18:50.760
where for whatever reason, this romance is forbidden, right?

18:51.840 --> 18:54.600
But speaking more generally about equality,

18:54.640 --> 18:59.640
yeah, I do think that, you know, even outside of fantasy,

19:00.240 --> 19:01.720
if you look at like role play

19:01.720 --> 19:04.000
and the kinds of like scenarios that, you know,

19:04.000 --> 19:06.200
if you look at like the fan fiction people, right,

19:06.200 --> 19:08.800
or erotica, like it's very common

19:08.800 --> 19:11.640
to have situations of power imbalance.

19:12.520 --> 19:15.080
So I think that, I don't think it's impossible

19:15.080 --> 19:19.640
to make equality sexy, but I think that for a lot of people,

19:19.640 --> 19:22.700
a kind of fantasy scenario gets more exciting

19:22.700 --> 19:25.260
with the addition of some kind of power play.

19:25.260 --> 19:29.020
Right, and the nature of fantasy and sexual fantasy

19:29.020 --> 19:32.060
is something that you go into a great deal of detail

19:32.060 --> 19:33.260
about, you have a lot of insight into,

19:33.260 --> 19:37.620
that fantasy is some way of like licensing ourselves

19:37.620 --> 19:42.460
to enjoy that thing while, can you complete my thought?

19:42.460 --> 19:44.100
Yeah, I think that human sexuality

19:44.100 --> 19:48.740
needs fantasy to function, like I think that we all,

19:48.740 --> 19:50.980
well, I don't want to over generalize,

19:50.980 --> 19:52.940
but I think that for most people,

19:52.940 --> 19:55.740
they don't experience, I don't know, sexuality

19:55.740 --> 19:58.380
as this kind of purely animalistic thing, right?

19:58.380 --> 20:01.780
It's usually sustained by some kind of fantasy content,

20:01.780 --> 20:04.820
you know, whether that's, I mean,

20:04.820 --> 20:07.900
I think the best way to encounter a lot of this

20:07.900 --> 20:10.500
is just to read a lot of like erotic fan fiction,

20:10.500 --> 20:12.900
for example, or to like, I don't know,

20:12.900 --> 20:14.700
I mean, you can also like, you know,

20:14.700 --> 20:16.420
if you have the stomach for it,

20:16.420 --> 20:19.100
you can look at pornography and, you know,

20:19.100 --> 20:21.540
I mean, it's the variety of situations

20:21.540 --> 20:24.780
that people can caught in their fantasies.

20:24.780 --> 20:27.140
I feel like speaks to something in human sexuality

20:27.140 --> 20:31.140
that kind of needs something more than just sex, right?

20:31.140 --> 20:33.580
Sex, sexuality is more than just sex.

20:33.580 --> 20:36.140
Even the bluntest, you know, porn hub video,

20:36.140 --> 20:39.020
that's just a video of two people going at it,

20:39.020 --> 20:42.060
at least the title will be like, you know,

20:42.060 --> 20:44.660
stepmother, blah, blah, blah, there's a scenario,

20:44.660 --> 20:45.860
like in the title of the video,

20:45.860 --> 20:48.100
at least to just like give you a frame

20:48.100 --> 20:49.780
of who these people are to each other,

20:49.780 --> 20:52.380
what they might have in common, and, you know,

20:52.380 --> 20:54.580
that might draw one person to the video more than another,

20:54.580 --> 20:55.900
depending on what you're into.

20:55.900 --> 20:57.540
And there has to be a reason for that, right?

20:57.540 --> 20:59.780
Like, I think if people,

20:59.780 --> 21:01.540
they wouldn't be, they wouldn't be so many stepbrothers

21:01.540 --> 21:04.140
in pornography if it wasn't appealing to people

21:04.140 --> 21:04.980
for some reason, right?

21:04.980 --> 21:06.540
That is generating clicks.

21:06.540 --> 21:07.540
Why is that?

21:07.540 --> 21:09.460
Well, I mean, we can analyze why.

21:09.460 --> 21:12.060
I don't think it's because, I don't think it is

21:12.060 --> 21:14.320
because most people have like some kind of secret,

21:14.320 --> 21:16.020
unconscious longing for incest.

21:16.020 --> 21:16.860
I don't think that's why.

21:16.860 --> 21:19.860
I think the taboo is being used in this case,

21:19.860 --> 21:22.660
where incest is a taboo, is being used,

21:22.660 --> 21:24.980
although it's kind of hedged with the like step thing, right?

21:24.980 --> 21:27.140
To, you know, we don't want to go too far,

21:27.140 --> 21:30.940
but like this element of like taboo is another factor

21:30.940 --> 21:32.620
that kind of increases the excitement

21:32.620 --> 21:34.300
by putting an additional barrier, right?

21:34.300 --> 21:36.740
Where like social norms are being shattered

21:36.740 --> 21:40.060
and desires in some way like pushing through the norm,

21:40.060 --> 21:42.980
and that element of like overcoming a barrier

21:42.980 --> 21:44.660
always seems to be what's exciting.

21:44.660 --> 21:47.500
And I think that goes back to like this idea

21:47.500 --> 21:50.780
that desire is lack or that you want what you don't have

21:50.780 --> 21:53.340
or want what you're not supposed to be able to have.

21:53.340 --> 21:56.460
You know, in a way, it's like the harder you have to,

21:56.460 --> 21:58.460
the more obstacles you have to overcome

21:58.460 --> 22:03.460
to get what you want in a way the more you want it

22:03.480 --> 22:05.740
or the more exciting that it seems, yeah.

22:05.740 --> 22:07.220
You also talk about fantasy.

22:07.220 --> 22:09.060
This is the most interesting part to me

22:09.060 --> 22:14.060
as being a way of, okay, so people say about Twilight a lot.

22:14.140 --> 22:15.940
Why is this the fantasy?

22:15.940 --> 22:18.540
This is a dangerous situation for, you know,

22:18.540 --> 22:20.980
Bella to want someone who might want to kill her

22:20.980 --> 22:22.980
or hurt her and is barely holding back.

22:22.980 --> 22:24.180
Isn't that frightening?

22:25.180 --> 22:27.300
But you talk about fantasy as being a way

22:27.300 --> 22:32.300
of almost creating a safe place for the female character

22:32.460 --> 22:34.820
to enjoy a certain type of desire

22:34.820 --> 22:36.380
that would otherwise be dangerous.

22:36.380 --> 22:38.740
I might be mutilating the point.

22:38.740 --> 22:40.500
Could you, you know what I'm talking about?

22:40.500 --> 22:42.740
Yeah, well, I think that, you know,

22:42.740 --> 22:45.460
look at the kinds of media that people consume all the time.

22:45.460 --> 22:49.020
Like the popularity of movies about the apocalypse

22:49.020 --> 22:53.100
or about, you know, all kinds of horrible things happening.

22:53.100 --> 22:55.460
People like to experience things in fantasy,

22:55.460 --> 22:56.700
in art, in general,

22:56.700 --> 22:59.660
that obviously we don't want to experience in reality.

22:59.660 --> 23:01.860
Yeah, we crave the apocalypse

23:01.860 --> 23:03.580
even though we don't want to live within it.

23:03.580 --> 23:06.460
Most of us do not want the apocalypse to happen,

23:06.460 --> 23:07.700
but there's, you know,

23:07.700 --> 23:09.700
there's something that just is endlessly fascinating

23:09.700 --> 23:11.100
to people about watching a movie

23:11.100 --> 23:12.740
where like New York City is destroyed.

23:12.740 --> 23:13.660
We just, we're obsessed

23:13.660 --> 23:15.860
because we just want to see it again and again.

23:15.860 --> 23:17.620
And that's not, I don't think

23:17.620 --> 23:20.260
because we actually want New York City to be destroyed, right?

23:20.260 --> 23:22.460
It's because there's, I don't know,

23:22.460 --> 23:24.220
there's some, there's some part of it

23:24.220 --> 23:26.460
that's part of us that's sort of fascinated

23:26.460 --> 23:29.500
with at least the idea of destruction, right?

23:29.500 --> 23:30.340
Yeah.

23:30.340 --> 23:32.540
And or like the fantasy of it, even though we, you know,

23:32.540 --> 23:36.580
and I think for mentally stable people,

23:36.580 --> 23:39.660
those two things are securely separated.

23:40.580 --> 23:42.740
You know, I do think that there's like a validity

23:42.740 --> 23:44.300
to the objection that, you know,

23:44.300 --> 23:46.580
people who worry about media like Twilight

23:46.580 --> 23:50.780
being so popular or normal among teenagers, you know,

23:50.780 --> 23:54.700
do teenagers have the media skills is the question, right?

23:54.700 --> 23:56.460
To understand, okay, like this is not

23:56.460 --> 23:58.540
depicting an actual relationship, right?

23:58.540 --> 24:00.580
Like this is not depicting an ideal.

24:00.580 --> 24:03.140
Like we don't, we don't want a real relationship

24:03.140 --> 24:05.620
with a vampire that that's not, that's, you know,

24:05.620 --> 24:07.620
this type of relationship is disastrous.

24:07.620 --> 24:09.100
If you're actually in a relationship

24:09.140 --> 24:11.420
with someone who wants to, you know, drink your blood

24:11.420 --> 24:13.500
or who wants to kill you or whatever, that's, you know,

24:13.500 --> 24:16.100
that's a catastrophe if it actually happens.

24:16.100 --> 24:20.220
But in fantasy, again, these things kind of become exciting

24:20.220 --> 24:22.180
and the danger as to the excitement.

24:23.100 --> 24:26.540
But, and I think that most readers of these things know that,

24:26.540 --> 24:27.380
right?

24:27.380 --> 24:30.300
I think most readers of dark romance novels are aware

24:30.300 --> 24:32.700
that what they're not, they're not consuming content

24:32.700 --> 24:34.500
that's like, ooh, this is a blueprint

24:34.500 --> 24:35.700
for how to live your life.

24:35.700 --> 24:37.460
Like most people know that when,

24:37.460 --> 24:40.060
when you read escapist fantasy, you're not,

24:40.060 --> 24:41.700
you don't actually want that to happen.

24:41.700 --> 24:44.100
But of course, you know, you can't always point to

24:44.100 --> 24:47.860
some people who don't have, who, who aren't so good

24:47.860 --> 24:49.820
at making those distinctions between fantasy

24:49.820 --> 24:51.660
and what they really want.

24:51.660 --> 24:55.540
But I do think that it's unfair to malign the fantasy itself

24:55.540 --> 25:00.540
because some people are sort of don't have like a good grip

25:00.540 --> 25:02.580
on the difference between fantasy and reality.

25:02.580 --> 25:05.140
Yeah, we all engage in fantasy.

25:05.140 --> 25:07.180
And yet, because it's a human thing to do.

25:07.180 --> 25:11.700
And yet there's this constant push to criticize the fantasies

25:11.700 --> 25:13.980
that other people have as being harmful

25:13.980 --> 25:15.580
while engaging in our own.

25:15.580 --> 25:16.540
Yeah, absolutely.

25:16.540 --> 25:19.100
And I mean, that's one reason why you have, you know,

25:19.100 --> 25:21.420
so slogans like, don't yuck my yum

25:21.420 --> 25:24.180
or like the discourse about kink shaming.

25:24.180 --> 25:25.780
I mean, obviously these that, you know,

25:25.780 --> 25:27.540
that those kinds of slogans are relative

25:27.540 --> 25:30.020
to a particular context where, you know,

25:30.020 --> 25:32.380
you've, you've agreed on in advance that, okay,

25:32.380 --> 25:34.340
this is a space where we're, where we're going

25:34.340 --> 25:35.740
to openly discuss sexuality.

25:35.740 --> 25:39.020
And, and so like within certain reasonable limits,

25:39.020 --> 25:42.300
I think we, you know, you say like, we appreciate

25:42.300 --> 25:46.060
that people have like a very diverse range of, you know,

25:46.060 --> 25:48.060
turn-ons basically, right?

25:48.060 --> 25:50.900
And so what other, what someone else might be into

25:50.900 --> 25:52.620
might seem like completely disgusting to you,

25:52.620 --> 25:55.340
but like, yeah, that's just, that's just how it is.

25:55.340 --> 25:58.140
Like, I don't know, the humans are very diverse.

25:58.980 --> 26:01.580
And human sexuality is like,

26:01.580 --> 26:03.540
is that kind of amazingly diverse in a way?

26:03.540 --> 26:06.900
Because the sense, obviously this is something that does

26:06.900 --> 26:09.900
at some point have some kind of biological evolutionary

26:09.900 --> 26:13.740
history, but the psychology of it has, is like,

26:13.740 --> 26:15.860
well, is a significantly more complicated

26:15.860 --> 26:17.340
than biological function.

26:17.340 --> 26:21.740
Yeah, and a big theme in the video is

26:21.740 --> 26:25.860
how our sexuality is more flexible or more, you know,

26:25.860 --> 26:28.740
less determined biologically than a lot of people think.

26:28.740 --> 26:29.900
You're pushing back against the idea

26:29.900 --> 26:32.660
of default heterosexual sadomasochism.

26:32.780 --> 26:36.260
A point that really spoke to me was,

26:36.260 --> 26:40.060
you noted how a lot of men who are, you know,

26:40.060 --> 26:42.060
socialized to be dominant or to, you know,

26:42.060 --> 26:44.980
to be the Edward in the situation, right?

26:44.980 --> 26:48.460
And to pursue and to be the desirer

26:48.460 --> 26:51.700
have like a latent wish to be desired.

26:51.700 --> 26:54.140
And I'll just say I related to this.

26:54.140 --> 26:57.220
I was like, you know, a little ping went off in my head.

26:57.220 --> 26:59.220
Ah, yes, I have felt that way

26:59.220 --> 27:00.780
and never quite had language for it,

27:00.780 --> 27:02.300
which I think is a wonderful thing

27:02.300 --> 27:03.820
that media like yours can do.

27:03.820 --> 27:06.420
Can you talk a little bit more about that idea

27:06.420 --> 27:08.140
and where that came from?

27:08.140 --> 27:09.260
Yeah, this is something I've heard

27:09.260 --> 27:10.740
from a lot of individual men.

27:10.740 --> 27:13.580
I mean, I also think that when I'm doing research

27:13.580 --> 27:15.340
on videos like this, I will kind of browse

27:15.340 --> 27:18.380
across social media in search of relevant discussions.

27:18.380 --> 27:20.180
And I remember one time, I think it was like

27:20.180 --> 27:23.220
the ask men subreddit, someone asked something

27:23.220 --> 27:25.820
along the lines of, you know, what is one thing

27:25.820 --> 27:28.180
that you want from relationships with women

27:28.180 --> 27:30.620
that you feel like you don't often get?

27:30.620 --> 27:32.700
And I think the most upvoted response to that question

27:32.700 --> 27:36.220
was I want to feel like I am desired.

27:37.220 --> 27:40.540
So I think that, you know, I think that both men

27:40.540 --> 27:44.260
and women are in a way not served well

27:44.260 --> 27:46.700
by being forced to conform to a default

27:46.700 --> 27:49.580
heterosexual sadomasochism where it's only the man

27:49.580 --> 27:52.060
who's supposed to desire and the woman only

27:52.060 --> 27:53.820
is supposed to want to be desired.

27:53.820 --> 27:55.900
I think that puts people in boxes

27:55.900 --> 27:58.780
where there's certain desires that don't get acknowledged

27:58.780 --> 27:59.620
or met.

27:59.620 --> 28:02.540
And as you say, often people don't have the words for it.

28:02.540 --> 28:06.140
So I think that a woman who kind of wants to that more

28:06.140 --> 28:11.140
like, quote unquote, virile, like pursuing a desiring rule,

28:12.660 --> 28:14.260
you know, we'll feel like she, there's something sort

28:14.260 --> 28:16.340
of masculine about inherent to that

28:16.340 --> 28:19.100
or something even sort of shamefully unfeminine about it.

28:19.100 --> 28:23.260
And likewise, I think that men are put in this situation

28:23.260 --> 28:25.940
where they, because they need to be the dominant

28:25.940 --> 28:29.620
active pursuers, there's part of them

28:29.620 --> 28:32.220
that maybe wants to be, you know, that you,

28:32.220 --> 28:33.500
you want to be pursued, right?

28:33.500 --> 28:35.460
You want to also feel that, you know,

28:35.460 --> 28:37.420
someone you're attracted to is attracted to you

28:37.420 --> 28:39.900
and will is kind of active in that.

28:39.900 --> 28:41.900
And it's not just like a passive participant

28:41.900 --> 28:43.540
for you to do things too, right?

28:43.540 --> 28:47.140
Like I think that, but I think that, you know,

28:48.260 --> 28:49.980
there's often some, there's often a kind of shame

28:49.980 --> 28:52.100
that comes with that where I think it, you know,

28:52.100 --> 28:55.740
it's sort of, it feels unmanly maybe.

28:55.740 --> 28:58.500
I think even to kind of want to be wanted.

28:58.500 --> 29:00.660
But there are times that, you know,

29:00.660 --> 29:02.340
I think you have some examples of this.

29:02.340 --> 29:05.340
If you look through the behaviors of actual men

29:05.340 --> 29:08.820
in real life, you know, they will betray that desire

29:08.820 --> 29:10.660
or there's certain features of masculine,

29:10.660 --> 29:13.060
well, I mean, you saw it for yourself on a Reddit page.

29:13.060 --> 29:16.180
These things are real and an acknowledgement

29:16.180 --> 29:19.340
of them can lead to a more functional sexuality.

29:19.340 --> 29:21.620
I mean, you, you had a, what's the word?

29:21.620 --> 29:23.540
It's not variability, something like that.

29:23.580 --> 29:28.460
Flexibility that you say, maybe rather than equality,

29:28.460 --> 29:30.380
we can strive for, what is the word you use?

29:30.380 --> 29:31.220
Versatility.

29:31.220 --> 29:32.620
Versatility, thank you.

29:32.620 --> 29:33.900
Just talk about that a little bit.

29:33.900 --> 29:36.420
Well, I guess, I mean, the word comes from,

29:36.420 --> 29:40.340
from gay culture where, you know,

29:40.340 --> 29:42.540
people will use terms like top and bottom

29:42.540 --> 29:45.220
or, you know, Dom and sub.

29:45.220 --> 29:47.580
And then the word verse means that you are someone

29:47.580 --> 29:50.660
who's interested in, or who likes,

29:50.700 --> 29:52.740
basically occupying either role.

29:53.740 --> 29:57.020
So verse, just sort of for versatile.

29:57.020 --> 30:00.940
But I think like most straight people do not use terms

30:00.940 --> 30:02.540
like top and bottom and, you know,

30:02.540 --> 30:04.180
there's a question of whether straight people should use them

30:04.180 --> 30:06.620
because it's something that comes from gay culture.

30:06.620 --> 30:08.460
But I do think that most people,

30:08.460 --> 30:11.180
gay or straight or bi or whatever you are,

30:11.180 --> 30:13.260
like would benefit from this concept,

30:13.260 --> 30:15.780
from being a little bit more open to versatility

30:15.780 --> 30:18.900
and relationships and in sexuality.

30:18.900 --> 30:22.780
I think that, I think a lot of people have like, you know,

30:22.780 --> 30:26.260
by putting themselves in one box or the other,

30:26.260 --> 30:30.540
kind of are closing off some part of their own desire.

30:30.540 --> 30:33.380
And it's something that you kind of discover

30:33.380 --> 30:35.180
by opening yourself up to it.

30:36.740 --> 30:39.580
Whereas I think most people tend to, you know,

30:39.580 --> 30:41.460
all of us are kind of on some level,

30:41.460 --> 30:43.720
the products of the social conditioning.

30:43.720 --> 30:48.060
And so there's a implicit value, I think,

30:48.060 --> 30:50.620
placed on a man being active or a woman being passive

30:50.620 --> 30:53.300
or a man being the one who desires,

30:53.300 --> 30:55.660
a woman who's sort of being desirable.

30:55.660 --> 30:59.180
And I think that for most people,

30:59.180 --> 31:02.620
if you want to get outside of those boxes,

31:02.620 --> 31:05.460
it involves navigating a certain level of shame

31:05.460 --> 31:09.380
and overcome and also like conceptually the confusion

31:09.380 --> 31:10.940
that comes with what I'm calling default,

31:10.940 --> 31:12.700
heterosexual masculinity, right?

31:12.700 --> 31:16.060
Where I think so many, this idea is like so deep

31:16.060 --> 31:19.020
that a lot of people think that what it is to be masculine

31:19.020 --> 31:23.660
or to be male even is to be active and to be, right?

31:23.660 --> 31:28.420
It's often like assumed to map on to anatomy in some way,

31:28.420 --> 31:29.260
right?

31:29.260 --> 31:31.540
That it's just assumed that like a male sexual role is active

31:31.540 --> 31:33.980
and a female sexual role is passive.

31:33.980 --> 31:34.820
But I don't think that's,

31:34.820 --> 31:37.100
I don't think that's psychologically the case.

31:37.100 --> 31:40.460
And I think that it comes across in things like,

31:40.460 --> 31:42.900
well, even if you just like look at like,

31:42.900 --> 31:45.820
manosphere like incel culture, for example,

31:45.820 --> 31:49.580
a lot of these, you know, so if you read incel forms,

31:49.580 --> 31:51.740
they get really upset when someone suggests

31:51.740 --> 31:53.180
like just hire a sex worker.

31:53.180 --> 31:54.220
Well, they don't want to do that.

31:54.220 --> 31:55.420
They don't want to hire a sex worker.

31:55.420 --> 31:56.260
Why?

31:56.260 --> 31:57.900
Because it's not really just about sex for them.

31:57.900 --> 31:59.700
They haven't really analyzed this maybe,

31:59.700 --> 32:02.660
but they want a woman to want them, right?

32:02.660 --> 32:03.980
They don't want to pay for it, right?

32:03.980 --> 32:06.140
They don't want this transaction because,

32:06.140 --> 32:08.460
because, you know, and maybe they feel like

32:08.460 --> 32:10.100
they can't say that and they don't know how to say it,

32:10.100 --> 32:12.500
but it's like, they want to feel desirable

32:12.500 --> 32:15.020
and that's something that they're sort of

32:15.020 --> 32:16.780
almost confused about, it seems.

32:16.780 --> 32:18.980
And likewise with, you know, romance novels,

32:18.980 --> 32:22.780
a very feminine genre, you know, a lot of romance novels

32:22.780 --> 32:26.620
are written with a very strong male perspective in them.

32:26.620 --> 32:29.220
And one thing that I kind of speculate about

32:29.220 --> 32:31.340
is I do think that a lot of women read romance novels

32:31.340 --> 32:33.860
and identify with the man, right?

32:33.860 --> 32:35.740
So, I mean, for example, and you know,

32:35.740 --> 32:37.900
Twilight, Stephanie Meyer has rewritten

32:37.900 --> 32:40.540
in this 2020 book, Midnight Sun,

32:40.540 --> 32:42.020
which is just the Twilight story,

32:42.020 --> 32:44.060
but told from Edward's perspective.

32:45.300 --> 32:47.300
It's common in mainstream romance novels,

32:47.300 --> 32:50.100
even for the male's perspective to be included,

32:50.100 --> 32:53.460
I think because women have the kind of versatility,

32:53.460 --> 32:56.940
a lot of female readers have like the versatility of that,

32:56.940 --> 32:57.780
right?

32:57.780 --> 32:58.620
They like being able to identify

32:58.620 --> 33:00.300
with either side of this dynamic.

33:00.300 --> 33:03.980
Yeah, and I mean, that's in Twilight a little bit itself

33:03.980 --> 33:06.900
that, you know, Edward has some,

33:06.900 --> 33:07.860
I think you would call,

33:08.020 --> 33:09.780
typically feminine qualities.

33:09.780 --> 33:11.580
That's what, you know, a lot of teenage boys

33:11.580 --> 33:13.700
were pissed about when the book came out that like,

33:13.700 --> 33:16.340
oh, he's kind of like a feminized vampire in some way.

33:16.340 --> 33:18.460
There's parts where Bella becomes a vampire,

33:18.460 --> 33:21.420
becomes stronger than him and maybe dominates him

33:21.420 --> 33:23.980
a little bit, like it's almost modeling

33:23.980 --> 33:27.620
a healthy, versatile like switch that they're able to do.

33:27.620 --> 33:29.140
Is that the case?

33:29.140 --> 33:31.620
Well, I think that if by the end of the series, right,

33:31.620 --> 33:34.180
that the dynamic between them does kind of equalize,

33:34.180 --> 33:36.220
which I do think is another thing that people do tend

33:36.220 --> 33:38.620
to neglect when they discuss this story,

33:38.620 --> 33:41.740
is that it starts out with this massive power imbalance.

33:41.740 --> 33:44.660
But by the end of the series,

33:44.660 --> 33:46.620
Bella has also become a vampire

33:46.620 --> 33:49.380
and she's kind of like risen to Edward's level

33:49.380 --> 33:51.140
and their dynamic is much more equal.

33:51.140 --> 33:54.420
And that's pretty explicitly something that's explored

33:54.420 --> 33:56.980
and breaking down at the last of those novels.

33:56.980 --> 33:58.460
Yeah, and even in the first film,

33:58.460 --> 34:00.380
which is the only one that I've seen, you know,

34:00.380 --> 34:03.420
yes, there's a dominant and submissive relationship

34:03.420 --> 34:06.220
to some degree, but also, you know,

34:06.220 --> 34:09.580
Edward is like almost driven mad by his desire.

34:09.580 --> 34:12.380
He can't stay away and I'm watching it going like,

34:12.380 --> 34:14.140
Bella doesn't feel like unpowerful.

34:14.140 --> 34:16.060
She feels like she has, you know,

34:16.060 --> 34:19.220
there is a power in the being chased, right?

34:19.220 --> 34:21.780
In being desired, like every single time

34:21.780 --> 34:23.460
one of these ideas arises,

34:23.460 --> 34:26.340
the opposite is buried just under the surface,

34:26.340 --> 34:29.660
like ready to come out and flip over in some way.

34:29.660 --> 34:31.220
And that sort of leads me to the end of the video.

34:31.220 --> 34:33.140
I think one of the most powerful ideas

34:33.180 --> 34:34.660
that when you got to this point, again,

34:34.660 --> 34:37.180
I was like, how did we get here in a video about Twilight?

34:37.180 --> 34:39.980
The idea that, you know, we do not have a,

34:39.980 --> 34:42.300
I'm gonna mangle again what you said,

34:42.300 --> 34:44.940
but, you know, we do not have a gender binary,

34:44.940 --> 34:46.180
we have a gender yin yang,

34:46.180 --> 34:49.500
where the masculine and feminine are counterparts

34:49.500 --> 34:50.860
and contain each other

34:50.860 --> 34:54.700
and are constantly undermining or replacing each other

34:54.700 --> 34:57.580
and that containing each other and nested, nested levels.

34:57.580 --> 34:59.460
How did you come to that idea?

34:59.460 --> 35:02.300
Was that through the examination of Twilight?

35:02.300 --> 35:05.020
Or was that an idea that you had had before

35:05.020 --> 35:07.380
that you expressed via Twilight?

35:07.380 --> 35:10.620
Well, I like the idea that this was some like deep truth

35:10.620 --> 35:12.780
that I discovered by reading Twilight.

35:12.780 --> 35:17.540
In reality, no, I don't think that was exactly how it happened.

35:17.540 --> 35:20.460
But yeah, I was actually thinking about the concept

35:20.460 --> 35:25.460
of yin yang and I like this kind of as a more,

35:27.580 --> 35:29.820
what I think is a deeper way of thinking about

35:29.820 --> 35:31.940
what people often think of as a binary.

35:31.940 --> 35:34.140
So a binary is just one and zero,

35:34.140 --> 35:38.420
but oftentimes binaries like masculine and feminine,

35:38.420 --> 35:41.740
that they sort of are mutually constitutive, right?

35:41.740 --> 35:44.420
Where like part of what it means to be,

35:44.420 --> 35:47.100
you can't really understand what we mean by masculinity

35:47.100 --> 35:50.220
unless it's complimented by this concept of femininity.

35:51.180 --> 35:54.180
And I think that when you appreciate that,

35:54.180 --> 35:58.500
you also kind of see the transformative capacity

35:58.500 --> 36:00.860
that exists in this where, you know,

36:00.900 --> 36:02.820
there is something feminine about the masculine

36:02.820 --> 36:04.820
and there's something masculine about the feminine.

36:04.820 --> 36:08.220
And one person is not just masculine or feminine.

36:08.220 --> 36:11.820
I think that, you know, we all have these sides to ourself

36:11.820 --> 36:14.300
and over time these can change

36:14.300 --> 36:15.900
and one or the other can be more dominant

36:15.900 --> 36:17.340
at different times.

36:17.340 --> 36:19.540
At least that's how I think about,

36:19.540 --> 36:21.900
that's how I think about masculinity and femininity,

36:21.900 --> 36:24.700
not as like, oh, either you're masculine or you're feminine

36:24.700 --> 36:26.620
and that's like an essential thing about yourself.

36:26.620 --> 36:30.340
Like, no, I think we each contain the whole dynamic

36:30.340 --> 36:31.780
in a way.

36:31.780 --> 36:35.620
So I think that that is something that,

36:35.620 --> 36:38.740
I mean, you don't have to explore this through Twilight,

36:38.740 --> 36:39.580
but I think that it's something

36:39.580 --> 36:42.140
that Twilight does ultimately explore.

36:42.140 --> 36:44.660
And not just Twilight, I mean, often romance novels,

36:44.660 --> 36:46.580
you know, they get a lot of criticism

36:46.580 --> 36:48.820
for being sort of, you know, masochistic,

36:48.820 --> 36:51.940
that is for having disempowered female protagonists,

36:51.940 --> 36:53.380
which a lot of them do,

36:53.380 --> 36:55.380
but a lot of those disempowered female protagonists

36:55.380 --> 36:57.980
also kind of end the novel powerful.

36:58.780 --> 37:01.500
And so I think in a way, the inequality,

37:02.420 --> 37:03.420
you know, I mean, it's complicated,

37:03.420 --> 37:04.460
where you could argue that the inequality

37:04.460 --> 37:07.900
is being romanticized and often it is,

37:07.900 --> 37:09.860
but also a lot of times the inequality

37:09.860 --> 37:13.460
is there as an obstacle to be overcome, right?

37:13.460 --> 37:17.140
The inequality is the driver of a conflict

37:17.140 --> 37:19.660
where the end of the fantasy,

37:19.660 --> 37:21.380
like the consummation of the fantasy

37:21.380 --> 37:24.140
is in a way overcoming the inequality

37:24.140 --> 37:27.220
and, you know, achieving an equal relationship.

37:27.220 --> 37:29.500
Right, the separation ending,

37:29.500 --> 37:32.900
the separation of desire ending and the becoming one,

37:32.900 --> 37:34.860
which brings us back to the yin-yang.

37:34.860 --> 37:39.660
And it's also a, I see how this works in sex, right?

37:39.660 --> 37:42.940
That if you are beginning in a masculine way,

37:42.940 --> 37:45.340
but there's the seeds of femininity within, right?

37:45.340 --> 37:48.740
And when that comes out, that is a sexy reversal, right?

37:50.180 --> 37:52.420
It makes me think a little bit in,

37:52.420 --> 37:54.740
this is a very strange comparison,

37:54.740 --> 37:56.020
but in comedy writing,

37:56.020 --> 37:59.780
something that we do a lot is hiring and lowering.

37:59.780 --> 38:01.380
You know, you want to see the low become high

38:01.380 --> 38:02.220
and the high become low.

38:02.220 --> 38:03.940
The Lord becomes the peasant,

38:03.940 --> 38:06.300
the dog starts walking around and giving orders, you know,

38:06.300 --> 38:08.980
like the dog and family guy or whatever, right?

38:08.980 --> 38:10.420
It's fun to see the flip

38:10.420 --> 38:12.660
and you wanna see it happen over and over, right?

38:12.660 --> 38:13.980
You wanna see in trading places,

38:13.980 --> 38:16.580
you wanna see them go up and down and down and up.

38:16.580 --> 38:20.260
It's the transition between the two that is enjoyable.

38:20.260 --> 38:24.380
It's not like the static nature of staying in one place,

38:24.380 --> 38:28.660
which I don't know, that's life, right?

38:28.660 --> 38:30.340
That's what is fulfilling,

38:30.340 --> 38:32.660
is to experience that going back and forth.

38:32.660 --> 38:34.300
I think there's so many odd connections

38:34.300 --> 38:36.220
between comedy and sexuality.

38:36.220 --> 38:38.700
There's, I like what you're saying about like high and low,

38:38.700 --> 38:41.020
sort of, you know, becoming each other.

38:41.020 --> 38:43.140
There's also the tension and release theme

38:43.140 --> 38:45.740
that I think I talk about a bit in the Twilight video.

38:45.740 --> 38:47.580
And obviously this is the thing that comics

38:47.580 --> 38:48.420
will talk about, right?

38:48.420 --> 38:49.380
You know, building tension,

38:49.380 --> 38:51.900
a joke often starts by building tension

38:51.900 --> 38:54.220
and then a punchline will be a release of that tension

38:54.220 --> 38:55.620
and the audience laughs.

38:55.620 --> 38:58.820
I mean, I think sexuality works that way too.

38:58.820 --> 39:02.380
The reason our romance novel usually has a kind of,

39:02.380 --> 39:03.460
I mean, there's a reason people like

39:03.460 --> 39:05.260
the historical romance novel, right?

39:05.260 --> 39:07.740
And part of it has to do with tension.

39:07.740 --> 39:10.500
There's more tension in historical romance,

39:10.500 --> 39:13.180
oftentimes because of the barriers

39:13.180 --> 39:14.960
that that setting involves, right?

39:14.960 --> 39:16.900
Everyone's wearing so many clothes.

39:16.900 --> 39:18.460
I mean, to be very literal about it,

39:18.460 --> 39:20.660
but also there's all, there's like social,

39:20.660 --> 39:23.300
there's social, it's not just the bodice,

39:23.380 --> 39:24.900
it's the social bodice, right?

39:24.900 --> 39:29.060
There's rules about who can have a romantic relationship

39:29.060 --> 39:32.300
with whom and those rules create a kind of,

39:32.300 --> 39:34.380
they add to the tension between characters.

39:34.380 --> 39:36.140
As the sort of stakes are higher,

39:36.140 --> 39:37.940
there's more that's key,

39:37.940 --> 39:39.860
the situation is high, strong, right?

39:39.860 --> 39:42.860
It's tense and that I think people find sexy,

39:42.860 --> 39:46.140
obviously hoping that eventually the tension is released,

39:46.140 --> 39:49.620
but in a way that it just kind of similar to a joke.

39:49.620 --> 39:52.420
Yeah, I mean, I love how comedy is similar

39:52.460 --> 39:53.980
to other genres, I have to think about comedy

39:53.980 --> 39:56.380
is similar to horror in a lot of ways.

39:56.380 --> 39:58.740
I've never considered how it's similar to romance,

39:58.740 --> 40:03.740
but it really is, that's so funny and surprising to me.

40:05.060 --> 40:08.100
Folks, did you know that learning actually makes a sound?

40:08.100 --> 40:10.260
It's true, listen to this.

40:10.260 --> 40:13.700
That is the sound of you learning a new language with Babbel.

40:13.700 --> 40:15.620
Learning a new language can be one of the toughest,

40:15.620 --> 40:17.860
yet most rewarding challenges out there.

40:17.860 --> 40:19.640
So if you are ready to dive in,

40:19.680 --> 40:21.480
make sure you are using the right tools

40:21.480 --> 40:22.800
to get the job done.

40:22.800 --> 40:25.640
See, Babbel isn't just a game masquerading

40:25.640 --> 40:28.280
as a learning app, it is crafted by real people

40:28.280 --> 40:30.080
for real conversations.

40:30.080 --> 40:31.880
With Babbel, you get tips and tools

40:31.880 --> 40:34.560
that are approachable and rooted in real life situations,

40:34.560 --> 40:36.920
delivered through conversation-based teaching.

40:36.920 --> 40:38.320
This means that you'll be ready to put

40:38.320 --> 40:41.760
what you have learned into practice in the real world.

40:41.760 --> 40:42.600
And let me tell you something,

40:42.600 --> 40:45.000
the real world is where you want to put the language

40:45.000 --> 40:47.120
you learned through Babbel into use.

40:47.120 --> 40:48.280
I live in Los Angeles,

40:48.280 --> 40:50.880
a huge number of my fellow Angelenos speak Spanish,

40:50.880 --> 40:53.640
and that means because I am studying Spanish with Babbel,

40:53.640 --> 40:56.040
I can actually improve my daily life

40:56.040 --> 40:57.880
and the communication with people around me.

40:57.880 --> 41:01.360
It has really enriched my experience of the city I live in

41:01.360 --> 41:03.640
because now words that used to mean nothing to me

41:03.640 --> 41:05.320
mean something, I can speak to people,

41:05.320 --> 41:07.480
I wasn't able to before, even just a little bit,

41:07.480 --> 41:09.080
it really makes a big difference.

41:09.080 --> 41:09.920
But you know what?

41:09.920 --> 41:11.560
You don't have to take my word for it.

41:11.560 --> 41:13.800
Studies from Yale, Michigan State University,

41:13.800 --> 41:16.280
and others show that Babbel is effective.

41:16.280 --> 41:19.440
One study even found that using Babbel for 15 hours

41:19.440 --> 41:21.880
is equivalent to a full semester of college.

41:21.880 --> 41:24.440
And look, I can't promise that it'll be easy,

41:24.440 --> 41:26.080
but you'll be glad you did it.

41:26.080 --> 41:26.920
And guess what?

41:26.920 --> 41:29.740
Here's a special limited time deal for faculty listeners.

41:29.740 --> 41:32.160
Right now you can get up to 60% off

41:32.160 --> 41:35.960
of your Babbel subscription, 60% but only for our listeners.

41:35.960 --> 41:38.040
At babbel.com slash factually,

41:38.040 --> 41:41.360
get up to 60% off at babbel.com slash factually,

41:41.360 --> 41:45.480
that's spelled B-A-B-B-E-L.com slash factually,

41:45.560 --> 41:47.760
rules and restrictions may apply.

41:47.760 --> 41:49.800
You also come to this point though,

41:49.800 --> 41:53.320
about human sexuality, I think it's so beautiful.

41:53.320 --> 41:58.320
You're talking about, again, SNM and fantasy and desire,

41:59.040 --> 42:01.040
but you come to this point about masculine and feminine

42:01.040 --> 42:02.160
containing each other.

42:02.160 --> 42:04.520
And one of the things I love that you say is,

42:04.520 --> 42:08.640
someone who is a masculine acting man or a trans person

42:08.640 --> 42:12.560
is not appropriating someone else's sexuality.

42:12.560 --> 42:14.680
Masculinity and femininity are like,

42:14.720 --> 42:16.080
we all have them as humans.

42:16.080 --> 42:18.680
We are all, and they're all our, you don't say birthright,

42:18.680 --> 42:21.720
but they're all something that we are entitled to

42:21.720 --> 42:23.360
by virtue of our humanity.

42:23.360 --> 42:25.000
And that's such a, I don't know,

42:25.000 --> 42:27.720
that's such a powerful point that spirals off

42:27.720 --> 42:30.480
in so many other directions, philosophical, political,

42:30.480 --> 42:32.680
and to get there from this place

42:32.680 --> 42:34.360
where you're talking about SNM and Twilight

42:34.360 --> 42:35.760
is fascinating to me.

42:35.760 --> 42:37.200
Yeah, I think that, I mean,

42:37.200 --> 42:39.280
people will often say, oh, genders differ from race,

42:39.280 --> 42:42.960
but then without really specifying what that difference is.

42:43.080 --> 42:45.680
I mean, I think one of them has to do with the fact that,

42:45.680 --> 42:48.760
you know, gender exists in some form

42:48.760 --> 42:52.120
in pretty much every human society that I'm aware of.

42:52.120 --> 42:54.480
I guess, you know, I think gender does,

42:54.480 --> 42:55.680
in some ancestral way, of course,

42:55.680 --> 43:00.680
derive from the kind of generally dimorphic reproductive roles,

43:00.840 --> 43:03.440
but obviously there's a lot more to gender than that.

43:03.440 --> 43:05.760
And in a lot of ways, gender has become,

43:05.760 --> 43:08.560
and for a long time, you know, quite unhinged,

43:08.560 --> 43:11.600
I think, from directly being about reproduction.

43:12.600 --> 43:17.600
But I think that, you know, unlike race or ethnicity,

43:17.640 --> 43:20.400
like within every human family, there is a man and a woman.

43:20.400 --> 43:22.080
Well, actually, not every human family, right?

43:22.080 --> 43:23.880
We can...

43:23.880 --> 43:25.160
Of course.

43:25.160 --> 43:28.000
But again, I think that the origin of,

43:28.000 --> 43:30.080
most people have a mother and a father,

43:30.080 --> 43:31.920
and I think that's the sort of origin of a lot of ideas

43:31.920 --> 43:34.960
about masculinity and femininity.

43:34.960 --> 43:38.280
And I think that no one person is like,

43:38.280 --> 43:41.080
you know, just the result of,

43:41.120 --> 43:42.440
I mean, I guess, I don't know,

43:42.440 --> 43:44.480
I guess there's probably some like monk somewhere

43:44.480 --> 43:48.840
who has never met a woman, but I don't know.

43:48.840 --> 43:51.280
I do feel that most people contain

43:51.280 --> 43:53.920
some masculine and feminine element.

43:54.880 --> 43:57.880
And I think that to me,

43:57.880 --> 44:01.440
I see some level of androgyny as being,

44:01.440 --> 44:02.600
I mean, I guess I'm kind of getting this

44:02.600 --> 44:03.640
from Virginia Woolf, right?

44:03.640 --> 44:06.960
Who says like, oh, a great writer is always androgynous,

44:06.960 --> 44:07.800
right?

44:07.800 --> 44:09.320
And the idea seeming to be that like,

44:09.360 --> 44:11.560
to kind of fully perfect yourself as an artist,

44:11.560 --> 44:14.560
you need to be in touch with both the masculine

44:14.560 --> 44:17.080
and the feminine within yourself.

44:17.080 --> 44:19.360
And, you know, if things get too unbalanced,

44:20.880 --> 44:21.840
it leads to problems.

44:21.840 --> 44:26.360
So I think that that applies not just to art,

44:26.360 --> 44:27.800
but also kind of to sexuality,

44:27.800 --> 44:30.640
where I guess I've tried it at times

44:30.640 --> 44:32.560
to force myself into one box or another.

44:32.560 --> 44:35.760
I've tried to be, you know,

44:35.760 --> 44:37.200
to make myself more masculine

44:37.240 --> 44:40.440
or try to conform to like a very strict idea of femininity.

44:40.440 --> 44:42.000
And neither of those has ever worked for me.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.040
So maybe this is just me, you know,

44:44.040 --> 44:47.360
in a way, philosophy is autobiography.

44:47.360 --> 44:48.880
In a way, maybe this is me just working

44:48.880 --> 44:49.840
for my own personal thing

44:49.840 --> 44:52.240
and then making sweeping generalizations about human nature.

44:52.240 --> 44:53.400
Well, lots of people do that.

44:53.400 --> 44:55.200
So I guess, you know, guilty.

44:55.200 --> 44:57.800
But I think it's, you know,

44:57.800 --> 44:59.080
there's sweeping generalizations

44:59.080 --> 45:00.960
that other people seem to relate to.

45:00.960 --> 45:02.480
So I think it's probably not just me

45:02.480 --> 45:05.800
that finds that only being strictly masculine

45:05.800 --> 45:07.560
or strictly feminine doesn't really,

45:07.560 --> 45:10.000
hasn't really worked out well for me.

45:10.000 --> 45:11.800
And I think it probably doesn't work out well

45:11.800 --> 45:13.040
for a lot of people.

45:13.040 --> 45:15.240
Yeah, I've often felt that in my own life,

45:15.240 --> 45:17.600
that that's a box that I was placed in

45:17.600 --> 45:21.840
and I have a constant sort of desire to undermine it

45:21.840 --> 45:24.440
or to find, you know, more richness in it

45:24.440 --> 45:26.160
or to find what I'm missing.

45:26.160 --> 45:28.720
And I think that's probably part of why this

45:28.720 --> 45:31.360
was a popular video is because it expresses that.

45:31.360 --> 45:33.720
You said philosophy, I want to talk more

45:33.760 --> 45:36.280
about how you think about this video

45:36.280 --> 45:37.320
as a work of philosophy.

45:37.320 --> 45:39.040
I mean, at one point, I believe there's a graphic

45:39.040 --> 45:41.680
on the screen that says, or maybe you say this out loud,

45:41.680 --> 45:43.000
that you made this video

45:43.000 --> 45:44.960
instead of writing a PhD dissertation.

45:44.960 --> 45:48.280
And at that moment, I realized, wait, this, yeah,

45:48.280 --> 45:50.720
that is this dense of a philosophical work.

45:50.720 --> 45:52.800
There is that many citation of other thinkers.

45:52.800 --> 45:55.200
You're doing that much original thinking.

45:55.200 --> 45:57.080
I mean, there's a huge number of videos

45:57.080 --> 45:59.400
that are, you know, philosophy videos on YouTube

45:59.400 --> 46:00.600
that are just summarizing.

46:00.600 --> 46:02.520
And that's wonderful for them to summarize.

46:02.520 --> 46:04.360
That's essentially what I feel I do as a comic.

46:04.360 --> 46:07.960
I read a bunch of ideas and I summarize them for you

46:07.960 --> 46:09.600
in a way that is funny and intelligible.

46:09.600 --> 46:10.600
I make it go down easy.

46:10.600 --> 46:13.120
And hopefully I get a couple of my own ideas in there too,

46:13.120 --> 46:15.640
because I'm a smart person and I like to think I am.

46:15.640 --> 46:17.960
And I have my own thoughts about the world.

46:17.960 --> 46:21.560
But I mean, at the end of this video,

46:21.560 --> 46:24.600
I was like, put this in a fucking library somewhere

46:24.600 --> 46:27.120
because people need to like keep watching it

46:27.120 --> 46:28.960
and understanding exactly what point you're making

46:28.960 --> 46:31.240
and put it into dialogue with other philosophers

46:31.240 --> 46:33.440
or psychologists or thinkers.

46:33.440 --> 46:36.320
I mean, how do you think about the work in that way?

46:36.320 --> 46:38.600
Well, I think unlike, I mean, this video,

46:38.600 --> 46:41.160
more than my other videos was like,

46:41.160 --> 46:42.960
I did so much research for this.

46:42.960 --> 46:45.800
I think I read at least 100 books for this.

46:45.800 --> 46:47.760
And then it also like a lot of articles and things.

46:47.760 --> 46:49.400
And so I tried to get like very familiar

46:49.400 --> 46:51.360
with like a wide range of thinking

46:51.360 --> 46:53.520
about the topics that I wanted to cover

46:53.520 --> 46:57.640
and use that to build what's basically a three hour argument

46:57.640 --> 46:59.320
of what I wanted to say.

46:59.320 --> 47:01.360
So that I think is more academic

47:01.360 --> 47:02.880
than most of the stuff I do on YouTube

47:02.880 --> 47:04.960
in the sense that the citations are very wide

47:04.960 --> 47:07.400
and there's a lot of them.

47:07.400 --> 47:10.280
But also, yeah, I am trying to make an argument

47:10.280 --> 47:12.240
that I think is my own argument.

47:12.240 --> 47:14.280
And then the citations are just sort of ways

47:14.280 --> 47:17.960
of like bringing in other people's ideas.

47:17.960 --> 47:19.400
You know, it's always tricky with a video essay.

47:19.400 --> 47:22.400
You wanna balance like the kind of academic side

47:22.400 --> 47:23.920
with the entertainment side.

47:23.920 --> 47:25.640
You can't just sit in front of a camera

47:25.640 --> 47:28.600
and like read your, you know, master's thesis or whatever.

47:28.600 --> 47:30.800
Because I think people will find that boring.

47:30.800 --> 47:35.120
But, you know, the hope anyway with this video

47:35.120 --> 47:37.640
was that I was gonna be able to balance

47:37.640 --> 47:40.920
what are my sincere ideas in my academic reading?

47:40.920 --> 47:42.680
I'm hoping that I presented this in a way

47:42.680 --> 47:46.560
that was not just kind of for an academic audience

47:46.560 --> 47:48.440
but would be for a popular audience.

47:48.440 --> 47:50.920
And people have watched the videos, I guess,

47:50.920 --> 47:52.960
on some level that has succeeded.

47:52.960 --> 47:56.680
I know you left the world of academia years ago

47:56.680 --> 47:58.760
after spending some time there.

47:58.760 --> 48:00.800
But it really struck me with this video

48:00.800 --> 48:04.320
that you are doing work that one would strive to do

48:04.320 --> 48:05.320
in an academic setting.

48:05.320 --> 48:07.600
I have to imagine that there are people, you know,

48:07.600 --> 48:10.320
in grad school or philosophy professors themselves

48:10.320 --> 48:14.280
who are thinking, my God, I wish my ideas, you know,

48:14.280 --> 48:18.920
we're able to get 3.7 million views on YouTube.

48:18.920 --> 48:23.920
Are you, is that a world that you still want to interact with

48:24.160 --> 48:26.160
or that you hope this video interacts with?

48:26.160 --> 48:28.520
Have you had outreach from, you know,

48:28.520 --> 48:31.480
people who are working on similar ideas and issues

48:31.480 --> 48:33.360
in the world of the Academy?

48:33.360 --> 48:34.400
I have, yeah.

48:34.400 --> 48:38.480
And I, it's been long enough now that I do sometimes miss

48:38.480 --> 48:41.200
the academic context.

48:41.200 --> 48:43.480
I mean, I think I kind of overdosed on it a bit

48:43.480 --> 48:44.320
when I was in my 20s.

48:44.320 --> 48:48.240
Like, I, you know, getting a, I got half of a philosophy,

48:48.240 --> 48:50.760
PhD, basically, and ended up quitting with a master's

48:50.760 --> 48:52.640
before writing a dissertation.

48:52.640 --> 48:56.880
But I think that I kind of coasted for a few years

48:56.880 --> 48:57.720
afterwards.

48:57.720 --> 48:59.800
I was like, well, I've basically spent most of my 20s

48:59.800 --> 49:00.960
with my face in a book.

49:00.960 --> 49:05.080
So now, you know, I want to like say things with that

49:05.080 --> 49:06.760
to an actual audience.

49:06.760 --> 49:09.840
And I felt that I found the audience on YouTube.

49:09.840 --> 49:12.400
But I think a few years ago, I started worrying.

49:12.400 --> 49:15.520
I was like, it's been years now since I was in,

49:15.520 --> 49:18.200
since I was taking classes or going to seminars,

49:18.200 --> 49:19.680
getting feedback from professors.

49:19.680 --> 49:20.720
I sort of started to worry.

49:20.720 --> 49:21.880
I was like, I'm going to get some,

49:21.880 --> 49:25.520
I'm going to start getting sloppy and boring.

49:25.520 --> 49:28.720
In a sense, if I don't, well, not boring,

49:28.720 --> 49:31.000
but I guess I worried that I was going to get a little too

49:31.000 --> 49:34.440
detached from that like research foundation.

49:34.440 --> 49:37.920
So I, with this project, I really wanted to make myself

49:37.920 --> 49:40.720
like go back to school in a way.

49:40.720 --> 49:44.160
And so I read a lot of like pretty dense texts

49:44.160 --> 49:49.160
from psychoanalysis to feminist theory to, you know,

49:50.000 --> 49:55.000
kind of a wide source of commentary on sexuality

49:55.120 --> 49:57.640
or on gender.

49:57.640 --> 50:02.640
So I tried to kind of bolster the substance of this video

50:03.640 --> 50:06.640
by using academic texts again.

50:06.640 --> 50:10.440
And that's such a, it's such a project to do that.

50:10.440 --> 50:13.080
Like as somebody who builds arguments myself

50:13.080 --> 50:16.960
and my own work done so on TV, I do so on YouTube now.

50:17.000 --> 50:19.920
It's a big lift for me to do 20 minutes, right?

50:19.920 --> 50:21.800
To make a 20 minute argument.

50:21.800 --> 50:23.360
You're doing a three hour argument

50:23.360 --> 50:25.960
where you're doing a vast amount of reading

50:25.960 --> 50:28.480
and also original thought.

50:28.480 --> 50:31.160
And I just would, I'm dying to know like

50:31.160 --> 50:32.760
a little bit about your process.

50:32.760 --> 50:34.520
Like when you're reading a hundred books, right?

50:34.520 --> 50:37.560
And you are trying to get your head around this argument

50:37.560 --> 50:38.920
that you want to make.

50:38.920 --> 50:40.480
What are you then doing with the book?

50:40.480 --> 50:42.560
Are you, do you have a note taking process?

50:42.560 --> 50:46.480
Like how are you assembling this argument as you go?

50:46.480 --> 50:49.120
Yeah, my methods for making this video

50:49.120 --> 50:51.720
were actually like so crazy that I can never do this again

50:51.720 --> 50:53.080
because it took so long.

50:53.080 --> 50:54.680
Like I have, okay.

50:54.680 --> 50:55.520
I have a dog here.

50:55.520 --> 50:56.840
How long did it take you all together by the way?

50:56.840 --> 50:58.000
Just how long were you working on this?

50:58.000 --> 50:59.160
I mean, I think I started it,

50:59.160 --> 51:03.680
I think I started it in like June, 2022

51:03.680 --> 51:06.720
and then published like March, 2024.

51:06.720 --> 51:09.120
So more than a year and a half.

51:09.120 --> 51:11.360
I mean, I was working on other things in between

51:11.360 --> 51:15.200
but I think that, when I say reading a hundred books,

51:15.240 --> 51:17.280
how long did it take me to read a hundred books?

51:17.280 --> 51:19.200
Well, usually it takes me more than one day

51:19.200 --> 51:20.800
to read one book.

51:20.800 --> 51:24.200
So, you know, there were a lot of reading days.

51:25.160 --> 51:29.080
And I had, I was writing down the quotes

51:29.080 --> 51:30.160
that I thought were interesting.

51:30.160 --> 51:31.760
I have a document on my computer

51:31.760 --> 51:35.320
that has more than a hundred thousand words

51:35.320 --> 51:37.720
of quotes and notes stuffed into it,

51:37.720 --> 51:40.600
which is just an insane, I mean, that's,

51:40.600 --> 51:43.920
that's, you know, at least novel length

51:43.960 --> 51:46.080
as just a notes document.

51:46.080 --> 51:47.800
And then most of that, obviously I didn't use

51:47.800 --> 51:50.520
because I way overdid the note taking.

51:50.520 --> 51:52.160
I'm not, that's why I say I'm not doing that again

51:52.160 --> 51:55.480
because there's probably a more efficient way to use time,

51:55.480 --> 51:56.440
which I'm trying to do

51:56.440 --> 51:57.920
because I don't want to just make one video

51:57.920 --> 51:59.040
every year and a half.

52:00.160 --> 52:01.960
So I've got to find ways to be a little more efficient

52:01.960 --> 52:02.840
than that.

52:02.840 --> 52:04.640
But for this one project, I was like,

52:04.640 --> 52:08.160
oh, I just, I just felt like really committing

52:08.160 --> 52:10.280
to the bookish element of it.

52:10.280 --> 52:15.280
So I, I made, you know, I guess a one time commitment

52:15.960 --> 52:19.920
to just to put in basically a year's worth of research.

52:19.920 --> 52:22.200
I really feel that making YouTube videos myself,

52:22.200 --> 52:24.520
the pull between spending as much time

52:24.520 --> 52:25.800
as you want on something

52:25.800 --> 52:28.200
and getting things out more quickly.

52:28.200 --> 52:30.440
I'm constantly trying to evaluate that myself

52:30.440 --> 52:32.320
with the work that I make.

52:33.480 --> 52:35.600
How do you think about, you know,

52:35.600 --> 52:39.240
pace and, you know, nurturing your audience on YouTube?

52:39.240 --> 52:41.920
Because as you say, you are a YouTuber.

52:41.920 --> 52:44.600
Being a YouTuber puts you at the mercy of the algorithm,

52:44.600 --> 52:48.400
at the, of the audience of these sort of, you know,

52:48.400 --> 52:52.720
very mechanized processes that determine success or failure.

52:52.720 --> 52:54.200
It seems like it would take a lot of trust

52:54.200 --> 52:56.360
to spend a year and a half on something

52:56.360 --> 52:58.520
and know that it will be watched on the other end

52:58.520 --> 53:00.920
and not be anxious about, ah, shouldn't I have put out,

53:00.920 --> 53:02.920
you know, 12 more videos in that period of time?

53:02.920 --> 53:04.560
Wouldn't that be better for my numbers?

53:04.560 --> 53:05.400
Like that's sort of thinking.

53:05.400 --> 53:06.240
How do you think about that?

53:06.240 --> 53:07.640
Oh, well, it definitely would be better for you

53:07.640 --> 53:09.360
for my numbers if I had made 12 videos

53:09.360 --> 53:11.520
instead of one three-hour video.

53:11.520 --> 53:13.080
I mean, I think that for me.

53:13.080 --> 53:16.280
Really? Because the three-hour video does well, you know.

53:16.280 --> 53:17.400
Yeah, well, okay, that's, I mean,

53:17.400 --> 53:18.880
I do think that long videos are,

53:18.880 --> 53:20.880
do seem to be doing well on YouTube lately.

53:20.880 --> 53:23.320
I think that when I was building an audience,

53:23.320 --> 53:24.320
I would never have been able,

53:24.320 --> 53:26.240
I don't think to do something like this.

53:26.240 --> 53:27.880
This is, this is kind of the like,

53:27.880 --> 53:30.600
the like luxury stuff you get to do

53:30.600 --> 53:35.080
if you have, you have already like built that foundation.

53:35.080 --> 53:35.920
Yeah.

53:35.920 --> 53:36.760
I definitely think there was like a period

53:36.880 --> 53:39.760
of having to grind a little bit to get, you know,

53:39.760 --> 53:41.640
videos that have at least every couple of months.

53:41.640 --> 53:44.120
And because, you know, at first you worry,

53:44.120 --> 53:45.800
we worry, you do worry a lot about like,

53:45.800 --> 53:48.520
oh, is the audience even going to still be there?

53:48.520 --> 53:50.560
I feel at this point, like I have built enough

53:50.560 --> 53:53.640
of a long-term audience that will kind of trust

53:53.640 --> 53:55.200
the process a little bit.

53:55.200 --> 53:56.960
And, you know, they will,

53:56.960 --> 53:58.840
I can, I feel like I can count on them

53:58.840 --> 54:01.040
to watch when I come up with a new thing,

54:01.040 --> 54:02.040
even if it's been a while.

54:02.040 --> 54:04.600
So I tend to worry about that a little less,

54:04.600 --> 54:07.240
though I do also think that, you know,

54:07.240 --> 54:08.640
a year and a half is too long.

54:08.640 --> 54:11.240
And I think that I benefit from a little bit

54:11.240 --> 54:12.800
because at a certain point with the research,

54:12.800 --> 54:14.840
there's, there are diminishing returns

54:14.840 --> 54:18.080
to spending more than a year on researching a video.

54:18.080 --> 54:19.880
I think at a certain point, you know,

54:19.880 --> 54:21.000
you have to say, okay, that's enough,

54:21.000 --> 54:25.160
like save the rest of the research for another video.

54:25.160 --> 54:27.760
So that's, that's from now on, I'm trying to do that

54:27.760 --> 54:29.800
because I do, I do want to make videos

54:29.800 --> 54:31.640
a little more frequently than once a year.

54:31.640 --> 54:33.480
Well, it's fascinating because you could have made

54:33.480 --> 54:36.200
just a video about, hey, I've been reading Twilight

54:36.200 --> 54:38.640
and there was a moral panic about this series

54:38.640 --> 54:40.680
and that misunderstands the nature of fantasy.

54:40.680 --> 54:43.040
And that would have been one great video

54:43.040 --> 54:45.440
that could have gotten a million views on its own,

54:45.440 --> 54:49.040
but that is one point within this massive edifice

54:49.040 --> 54:50.760
that you built.

54:50.760 --> 54:53.320
And so yeah, I'm curious about,

54:53.320 --> 54:56.640
is there some value to you in your creative process

54:56.640 --> 55:00.760
of exploring so much in a single video

55:00.760 --> 55:02.960
rather than chunking it up or making a more,

55:02.960 --> 55:06.920
you know, I often look to make one discrete point, maybe two.

55:06.920 --> 55:08.360
And if I do more than that, I start going,

55:08.360 --> 55:10.040
ah, maybe I'm getting too over ambitious

55:10.040 --> 55:11.760
and I need to scale it back.

55:11.760 --> 55:14.280
Whereas this video is so incredibly maximalist

55:14.280 --> 55:16.640
in its conception and design,

55:16.640 --> 55:19.080
is there something about that that draws you?

55:19.080 --> 55:19.920
Yes, there is.

55:19.920 --> 55:21.560
And it's hard for me to explain what it is,

55:21.560 --> 55:25.040
but I do think that that I am sort of ambitiously drawn

55:25.040 --> 55:27.840
towards like more and more elaborate projects.

55:27.840 --> 55:29.960
It's something that I have to like fight in myself

55:29.960 --> 55:32.640
to not, to make every video not be three hours long,

55:32.640 --> 55:34.200
but I do think that I like,

55:34.200 --> 55:35.040
I don't know, there's something,

55:35.040 --> 55:36.760
there's something fun to me to be exploring one topic

55:36.760 --> 55:38.640
from like every possible angle.

55:39.600 --> 55:41.600
And I don't know, there seems to be an audience

55:41.600 --> 55:43.040
that is appreciative of that kind of like

55:43.040 --> 55:45.240
extremely thorough deep dive.

55:46.200 --> 55:48.440
You know, I think that,

55:48.440 --> 55:50.520
there was a time I remember when YouTubers

55:50.520 --> 55:51.640
were basically giving the advice,

55:51.640 --> 55:53.160
like go no more than 10 minutes,

55:53.160 --> 55:55.600
like no one has an attention span anymore in this day.

55:55.600 --> 55:57.760
And now like people just regularly watch content

55:57.760 --> 55:58.720
that's hours long.

55:59.560 --> 56:01.040
I think part of it has to do with, you know,

56:01.040 --> 56:04.040
the way that people watch videos has changed.

56:04.040 --> 56:05.440
I think a lot of people, you know,

56:05.440 --> 56:06.440
they watch a video kind of like,

56:06.440 --> 56:08.120
kind of like they listen to a podcast, right?

56:08.120 --> 56:10.520
It's kind of on, you know, maybe, you know,

56:10.520 --> 56:13.080
I'm not so, I'm not so arrogant

56:13.080 --> 56:14.920
that I think everyone who watches my videos

56:14.920 --> 56:18.360
has to sit down at the TV with a full thing of popcorn

56:18.360 --> 56:20.920
and give me their undivided attention.

56:20.920 --> 56:22.600
I mean, I guess I'd be flattered if people do that,

56:22.600 --> 56:24.480
but I'm sure, I mean, that's not how I watch video essays.

56:24.480 --> 56:26.320
I mean, I'm doing the laundry.

56:26.320 --> 56:28.840
YouTube is also the most popular streaming service

56:28.840 --> 56:29.680
on television.

56:29.680 --> 56:31.880
Like it is more popular than Netflix.

56:31.880 --> 56:34.080
And so surely some people are doing that.

56:34.080 --> 56:35.160
They're loading it up.

56:35.160 --> 56:36.320
They're no longer just, you know,

56:36.320 --> 56:39.560
clicking on a link at work, you know, in a browser tab.

56:39.560 --> 56:41.600
And so there's been a lot of changes.

56:41.600 --> 56:42.800
Yeah, and I do try to, I mean,

56:42.800 --> 56:45.200
I do put effort into like visuals and things.

56:45.200 --> 56:48.600
I do want to reward the people who have taken, you know,

56:48.600 --> 56:51.120
who have put the video up on their TV

56:51.120 --> 56:52.600
and are sitting down to watch it.

56:52.600 --> 56:54.800
I do want it to make that worth people's while,

56:54.800 --> 56:56.000
but I also know that, you know,

56:56.000 --> 56:58.560
some people are cooking dinner and that's fine too.

56:58.560 --> 57:01.720
You make almost every element of these videos yourself, right?

57:01.720 --> 57:04.360
In addition to writing them, you also,

57:04.360 --> 57:06.200
my understanding is you're your own DP.

57:06.200 --> 57:07.040
You do your own lighting.

57:07.040 --> 57:08.000
You do your own editing.

57:08.000 --> 57:10.240
I believe you have other folks do the music.

57:10.240 --> 57:11.600
Do I have that basically right?

57:11.600 --> 57:13.240
Yeah, that's right.

57:13.240 --> 57:15.440
I definitely, people always ask me like,

57:15.440 --> 57:17.200
why are you doing this to yourself?

57:17.200 --> 57:19.840
Like, why don't you hire more people to do it?

57:19.840 --> 57:21.200
That was my next question now.

57:21.200 --> 57:22.760
You have the money to do it.

57:22.760 --> 57:25.600
Yeah, I feel like, well,

57:25.600 --> 57:27.640
I think I've just gotten so used to doing it

57:27.640 --> 57:29.440
in this kind of solitary way

57:29.440 --> 57:33.240
that now it kind of feels like I would be like,

57:33.240 --> 57:36.080
I don't know, I would be taking my own,

57:36.080 --> 57:37.680
I feel like what people like about my videos

57:37.680 --> 57:40.160
probably is that I made them on some level.

57:40.160 --> 57:43.320
And so, I think there's something that sort of comes across

57:43.320 --> 57:46.320
from like one person's like manic project.

57:46.320 --> 57:48.800
Like, even, I mean, I don't know,

57:48.800 --> 57:50.320
even if there's imperfections,

57:50.320 --> 57:51.480
which I'm sure there are, right?

57:51.480 --> 57:53.440
Like, there are ways that a professional

57:53.440 --> 57:56.240
could probably like do better lighting or something.

57:56.240 --> 57:57.760
But I don't know, there's like,

57:57.760 --> 57:59.000
I have like the way that I do it

57:59.000 --> 58:00.280
and I think it gives the videos

58:00.280 --> 58:01.800
kind of a distinctive feel.

58:02.800 --> 58:05.320
I just think it's something that people pick up on.

58:05.320 --> 58:07.480
And also maybe it's just me being like a reclusive loner

58:07.480 --> 58:09.800
or whatever and not wanting to deal

58:09.800 --> 58:13.960
with the social element of having up.

58:13.960 --> 58:15.160
No, that's such a great answer.

58:15.160 --> 58:16.640
I mean, I've learned in my own work

58:16.640 --> 58:18.480
how much the process is the product

58:18.480 --> 58:20.560
and I actually experienced, you know,

58:20.560 --> 58:23.040
I came from doing videos on a website called College Humor.

58:23.040 --> 58:25.320
We had our low budget way of doing things

58:25.320 --> 58:27.720
and I experienced later on

58:27.720 --> 58:29.480
when I was doing work on Netflix,

58:29.480 --> 58:31.160
there were things that I wanted to do

58:31.160 --> 58:33.760
that were actually harder to do with more resources

58:33.760 --> 58:35.560
than when I had less.

58:35.560 --> 58:38.160
And I would try to get certain sort of gags done,

58:38.160 --> 58:39.200
certain sort of visual effects,

58:39.200 --> 58:40.920
try to use things on a certain timeline.

58:40.920 --> 58:43.640
And the more expensive crews that we had to work with said,

58:43.640 --> 58:44.760
we don't know how to do it that way.

58:44.760 --> 58:47.040
I was like, oh, well, the 25 year old I used to work with

58:47.040 --> 58:48.880
like could help me do it that way, right?

58:48.880 --> 58:50.960
And so the process is the product.

58:50.960 --> 58:53.800
The way you make the thing is how the thing comes out.

58:53.800 --> 58:55.360
And so I understand, yeah,

58:55.360 --> 58:57.120
if that's how you got started doing it all yourself,

58:57.120 --> 58:58.200
that's what the audience likes.

58:58.200 --> 58:59.200
That's the way you do it.

58:59.200 --> 59:01.640
You maybe don't wanna fuck with something that's working

59:01.640 --> 59:02.880
because what the audience likes

59:02.880 --> 59:05.920
partially is the feeling of watching this lady go crazy

59:05.920 --> 59:07.120
in her own house at 4 a.m.

59:07.120 --> 59:09.680
You know, they like a little bit of that feeling.

59:09.680 --> 59:11.000
I think that's exactly what it is.

59:11.000 --> 59:13.320
Cause I think there's a certain vibe

59:13.320 --> 59:15.040
for you for a better term

59:15.040 --> 59:18.360
to a person like manically recording a video

59:18.360 --> 59:20.240
in a room alone at four in the morning.

59:20.240 --> 59:21.080
Like, I don't know.

59:21.080 --> 59:22.800
I don't know if that could be replicated

59:23.080 --> 59:24.920
if I weren't literally doing that.

59:25.840 --> 59:27.160
Yeah. So I don't know.

59:27.160 --> 59:29.000
So in terms of your audience,

59:29.000 --> 59:30.960
you are entirely audience supported.

59:30.960 --> 59:33.600
I don't think you take ads of any kind.

59:33.600 --> 59:35.960
There is, that's a wonderful thing that's possible now

59:35.960 --> 59:38.640
in today's internet media ecosystem.

59:38.640 --> 59:41.640
It's also, there's a hazard of audience capture

59:41.640 --> 59:44.360
of your audience driving what you're doing too much

59:44.360 --> 59:47.000
or of feeling at the whim of your audience.

59:47.000 --> 59:48.840
What has your experience been with that

59:48.840 --> 59:51.440
and how do you resist that affecting your work?

59:51.440 --> 59:53.520
Well, I am very grateful to Patreon

59:53.520 --> 59:57.920
for allowing me to like have a financially viable career

59:57.920 --> 01:00:00.440
without filling the videos with ads.

01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:03.320
That it's a good model.

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:05.480
I do think that as you say,

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:07.240
there's a hazardous side to it,

01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:10.160
which is that, you know, it's not the,

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:11.640
in a way you don't have a boss,

01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:15.160
but in another way your boss is like this mob, right?

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:16.960
This group of a few thousand people

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:18.560
who are funding your project.

01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:21.240
So you do, you are kind of accountable to them in a way.

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:24.080
So how do you not just become a people pleaser?

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:24.920
Yeah.

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:25.760
Well, I think, I mean, I've been,

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:29.320
lately I've been doing these like Patreon only videos

01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:31.520
that, you know, I'm just charging people two months,

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:33.920
two dollars a month or whatever to watch them.

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:36.560
And then our people can pay more to vote on the topic.

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:38.200
And I do think that people who vote on topics

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:40.480
that are sort of, that are different than what I would,

01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:42.120
I don't think anyone would have voted for Twilight,

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:43.560
for example, right?

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:46.080
I don't think that if I had had a poll

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:47.760
to decide what my next video was going to be,

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:50.560
I don't think Twilight would have gotten a lot of votes.

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:53.880
You know, people tend to vote for things,

01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:55.120
well, one things they've heard of.

01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:56.600
So it has to be something familiar.

01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:58.440
It has to be often something topical.

01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:00.280
We'll get more votes than something that's, you know,

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:04.000
kind of outdated or that doesn't seem particularly relevant

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:04.840
to the moment.

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:07.280
But yeah, I do think that there's something to be said

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:08.120
for me trying, you know,

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:10.800
using that kind of voting feedback

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:12.560
so that I kind of keep in touch

01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:14.040
with what people care about.

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:16.000
But I do think that it's also good

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:16.880
for the main channel videos

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:20.480
that I'm not just taking,

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:24.400
that I'm not just having the topic dictated to me

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:25.760
by the audience demand.

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:27.760
Because I think a lot of times people don't know

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:30.880
what they want or, you know,

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:33.840
the most exciting content I feel like comes from,

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:36.400
I had no idea that I wanted this, right?

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:39.400
Like, I would not have asked someone to make a three hour

01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:42.560
video analyzing Twilight from every imaginable

01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:45.600
philosophical angle, but hopefully now that it's here,

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:46.640
they like it.

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:50.240
I think also, you know, a lot of times what you think

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:53.080
you want is more of what you've liked in the past,

01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:55.920
which I think can kind of stifle,

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:57.800
it can stifle innovation or change where,

01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:59.920
well, I mean, look what's happened with movies

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:01.880
where everything's a sequel now, right?

01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:05.080
I think that you can become too conservative

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:07.640
in terms of what you are willing to experiment

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:11.280
with creatively if the way that you choose

01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:13.800
what projects to work on is just informed

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:15.760
by what has succeeded in the past.

01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:17.480
Well, then you just make the same thing again and again,

01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:20.680
and no innovation ever happens.

01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:22.320
Yeah, and if you just make the thing

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:24.080
that the audience says that they want,

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:25.360
there is some value in that.

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:26.400
That is something that the,

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:28.240
there's an value in pleasing the audience.

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:29.840
But if that's all that you do,

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:31.920
the audience is never surprised.

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:34.040
That's what always bothers me so much about,

01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:38.200
you know, it's a cliche, but fans of IP media,

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:40.600
of superhero media or whatever, being like,

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:42.920
we didn't want this, this isn't what the fans asked for,

01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:45.120
sort of discourse, why didn't they ask us

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:46.920
before they made the new Star Wars?

01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:48.600
Like, well, is that what you want?

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:50.920
Like you didn't know, you wouldn't have known

01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:54.400
to ask for the first Star Wars movie before it came out,

01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:58.680
because it was a unique act of creativity

01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:02.040
on the part of this weird dude, George Lucas.

01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:04.160
And in fact, that was what we liked about it.

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:07.280
And the reappraisal of the Star Wars prequels

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:09.680
is exactly about that, that George was just being weird.

01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:11.080
And that was kind of more interesting

01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:13.760
than some mega corporation trying to give people

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:15.360
exactly what they wanted.

01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:19.440
We don't get serendipity and surprise in media that way.

01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:20.720
Yeah, I completely agree with that.

01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:22.600
And I do think that it's too bad that,

01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:25.800
well, I do think that I have an increasing sense,

01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:28.120
I mean, Star Wars is probably literally the case

01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:29.240
that a lot of creative decisions

01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:31.920
are basically being made in corporate boardrooms.

01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:35.880
And, yeah, I mean, it seemed, that's how it feels.

01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:38.200
It comes across, like I liked your slogan

01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:39.840
about the process as a product.

01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:42.120
It comes across, right, week we can tell.

01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:46.200
And, yeah, totally, you could just basically remake

01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:47.680
the first Star Wars movie now,

01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:49.640
but it wouldn't have the same impact that it had initially,

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:53.560
because we've already seen Star Wars make a new thing, right?

01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:54.880
Yeah, yeah.

01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:58.960
You are diagnosing the exact problem with my business.

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:01.680
Yeah, that nobody is making new things currently.

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:03.240
Everybody was trying to figure out,

01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:04.880
this has worked in the past,

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:06.280
so let's make another one of those.

01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:08.840
What is working and nobody is taking a chance

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:10.000
on the new thing.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.080
And one of the real ironies of creative work in Hollywood,

01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:16.040
at least, is even the executives don't know what they want,

01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:19.680
because if they did, they would be writers and directors,

01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:23.360
but they aren't, because they are not the creative people.

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:27.840
You at some point need to trust a creative person saying,

01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:30.280
I think this is a good idea, I just wanna make it,

01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:31.680
you should believe in me.

01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:36.240
If you wanna get the thing that is a surprise hit,

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:39.640
that changes the culture or makes things go in a new way.

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:41.280
Yeah, it requires you to take chances,

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:42.880
which means that sometimes you'll lose,

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:45.720
but I also think that the super conservative approach to,

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:48.240
oh, just keep making the same thing that worked in the past.

01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:50.520
I think that's a very short-term way of thinking,

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:52.960
where people will eventually get bored,

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:55.840
of you making the exact same superhero movie again and again.

01:04:55.840 --> 01:05:00.520
And I think that, even economically,

01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:02.160
that will eventually cost you,

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:04.760
it's worth it, I think,

01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:07.720
to take chances on someone who's trying something new.

01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:09.920
Sometimes it won't work, but when it does,

01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:11.800
it really pays off.

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:14.080
Yeah, and that's why some of the best media brands

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:15.920
are the ones that you get used to

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:17.480
taking an interesting chance,

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:20.920
where, oh, if this came out, HBO used to be like this,

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:22.520
oh, they put a lot of money into something,

01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:23.360
I don't know if it's for me.

01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:24.560
You know what, I'll watch a couple,

01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:27.400
just because I have a certain expectation.

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:29.760
I think people have that same expectation of your work.

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:33.240
Normally, I had no interest in Twilight, right?

01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:35.400
It was not particularly on my radar,

01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:37.360
but, oh, Natalie has a new video out

01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:40.560
that's three hours of Natalie talking about Twilight.

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:41.560
I am interested in that,

01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:42.960
because I have seen your past work,

01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:47.120
and I know that you are going to surprise and delight me.

01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:49.880
I love your approach of your slaking the audience's thirst

01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:52.600
to have a say with your Patreon videos,

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:54.760
and then you are separately using that

01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:58.840
to be able to fund your crazy passion products,

01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:00.680
which are the things that people actually want of you.

01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:02.680
That's a wonderful audience expectation to set.

01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:03.760
Yeah, and it does require me

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:06.440
to have a level of trust in my own audience.

01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:09.120
I'm trusting them to trust me, in a way.

01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:10.960
Like, I know you probably don't think

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:12.240
you want a three-hour video about Twilight,

01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:14.800
but I have an idea for one that I think you probably do want.

01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:17.200
Just let me do it, and then we'll see.

01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:21.320
I'm sure I will occasionally do projects that don't hit,

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:22.560
because no one has all hits,

01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:26.760
but I think it's worth it to me to take the risk,

01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:30.440
because I don't want to stultify, you know?

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:35.160
Do you have bigger aspirations in media?

01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:38.240
Because, look, again, in the field I'm in,

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:41.000
I'm always like, my instinct is how is that a TV show?

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.240
Or how is that a movie?

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:45.960
Or how is that just what's the bigger version of the thing?

01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:49.960
Which is a very capitalist fueled impulse

01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:51.320
that comes from the media environment

01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:55.480
that I have to work in, because that's the life I live.

01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:57.480
Whereas you have absolute freedom,

01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:00.760
where you're able to make a living and do what you want.

01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:03.560
And yet, you know, this video is so ambitious.

01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:05.880
I'm curious if you just, you know,

01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:08.680
is there more that you want to do and in what direction?

01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:11.000
Well, I'm pretty happy with the current process.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.360
I mean, is there more that I want to do?

01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:14.400
Yes, but I feel like the more that I want to do

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:18.280
is not necessarily what most people imagine I would want to do.

01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:19.240
People ask me all the time,

01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:21.960
like, aren't you going to have like a Netflix show

01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:23.240
or something at some point?

01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:25.560
Or, you know, when are you going to like have a,

01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:27.360
I mean, they don't say when you're going to have a real job,

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:28.920
but there's some, there's some of these things

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:30.760
like a little bit of an implication of that.

01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:32.440
When are you going to make it big, right?

01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:33.680
That's the idea, that's the implication.

01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:34.840
Yeah, when are you going to make it big?

01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:38.840
I'm pretty happy making it medium, actually, at the moment.

01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:41.560
Like, I think that I like the independence

01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:45.600
and I like the fact that I can do like weird experimental things.

01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:49.240
And I like the kind of direct relationship to the audience

01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:51.040
that I feel like I have through Patreon,

01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:53.600
where it's not mediated by a studio.

01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:54.440
I don't know.

01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:57.480
There's not to say that I will never try, you know,

01:07:57.480 --> 01:08:02.760
doing something that is with a more conventional,

01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:04.720
you know, production approach.

01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:06.960
But I feel like for the time being,

01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:10.560
I'm pretty happy with the way that this works out

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:12.800
with Patreon and with the audience on YouTube.

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:16.760
And so I'm not like itching to change it up in that sense.

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:18.000
Yeah, I would also ask,

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.600
oh, would you ever want to write a book?

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:24.200
Except that again, the video to me has the density of a book.

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:26.920
Every sentence is something that I want to pause and unpack

01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:30.720
and reread, and yet is being seen by more people.

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:33.760
You are able to, I think, probably make a better living at it

01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:36.360
than you would if you were to publish it as a book.

01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:40.000
Is there, it seems kind of perfect

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.720
for getting the ideas that you want to get out out.

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:44.920
And yet I think there's maybe a YouTube stench

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:48.600
that I feel as well of, isn't there some

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:50.920
more legitimate place to go?

01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:52.920
No, I mean, people asked that too, right?

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:54.160
When are you going to write a book?

01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:55.680
Well, I don't know, I might write a book.

01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:57.000
I may well write a book someday,

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.920
probably when I get tired of looking

01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:00.200
at my face on the screen.

01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:05.200
But I think that I feel like I've put so much time

01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:08.720
into learning the skills of doing video essays

01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:11.240
that I feel like I may still continue doing the thing

01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:12.360
that I know I'm good at.

01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:13.880
I mean, part of that, of course, is writing.

01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:16.400
And I'm sure that that skill would transfer over

01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:17.320
to writing a book.

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:21.880
So again, I think I haven't ruled that out.

01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:23.840
I imagine myself writing a book someday,

01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:26.440
but for the time being, all the ideas that I have

01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:28.520
for books, I feel like I end up making them into videos.

01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:32.160
So it's not, it doesn't seem like a super pressing need

01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:35.120
for me to switch media.

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:37.080
I don't feel that you'll ever get sick

01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:37.960
of looking at your own face.

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:39.360
If you spent this long doing it,

01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:42.920
you have the same sickness that I do where...

01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:45.120
If the narcissism has lasted this long,

01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:47.080
I should be in the clear, right?

01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:48.760
Yeah, if you want this many people,

01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:49.960
if you have spent this much time

01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:51.080
trying to get people to look at you,

01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:52.520
you must want people to do it.

01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:54.120
That's never gonna leave you.

01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:57.560
Yeah, it's a long-term personality defect.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.560
What have you been thinking about

01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:03.120
or reading more recently that is...

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:05.320
I mean, this video took you a year and a half.

01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:06.840
It came out a few months ago.

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:09.040
What directions do you find yourself being pulled now

01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:10.240
in terms of your interests?

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:13.200
Well, I spent so much time on this Twilight video

01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:14.960
that I net like for the last few months,

01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:16.800
I just avoid anything romance fiction.

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:18.840
I'm like, I thought about it for a year and a half.

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:19.680
I can't stand it.

01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:21.600
In another year, I'm sure it'll interest me again

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:22.800
and I'll go back to it.

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:25.280
But yeah, I definitely will do something

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:26.800
completely different next.

01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:29.040
Obviously, well, I'm very anxious

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:32.080
about American politics this year.

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:35.120
So I think probably I'll get something

01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:38.040
sort of a little bit more directly political,

01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:39.520
politically engaging next.

01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:42.080
I've been doing research for most of my adult life

01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:43.480
on conspiracy theories.

01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:45.800
So that's something that definitely interests me

01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:47.480
as a possible topic.

01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:48.320
And those go together.

01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:50.320
I mean, American politics this year

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:52.400
and conspiracy theories, it feels like we're living

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:55.080
in a more conspiratorial politics than ever.

01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:57.240
I remember a time when conspiracism

01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:59.800
was this kind of counter-cultural thing

01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:02.560
like in the Bush era or early Obama years.

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:04.160
But now, yeah, it's fun.

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:07.600
It was like, you know, Men in Black was a movie, right?

01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:09.880
It wasn't something that people actually believed in.

01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:11.960
Right, or it was, I mean,

01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:15.920
I guess there was always the 9-11 truth stuff and that.

01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:19.680
But even that, it never seemed very threatening to me.

01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:21.600
I guess, I don't know, but maybe it should have

01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:23.800
because now, I mean, at this stage,

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:26.000
like the Republican Party may as well be

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:31.000
a conspiracist party where like central ideas of Trump

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.480
include the idea that the elections are rigged.

01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:38.320
So that's not, you know, this is not counter-culture anymore.

01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:39.680
This guy was president.

01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:41.040
He's friends with Alex Jones,

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:43.440
or at least they're in communication.

01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:46.520
So this is, you know,

01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:48.640
I've been talking with some people lately

01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:51.680
about whether QAnon is totally irrelevant now.

01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:54.080
And I think that it's not irrelevant.

01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:55.600
But the reason that it's not irrelevant

01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:58.640
is that it's actually, a lot of the pieces of QAnon

01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:03.640
have just become incorporated into the main of the Republican Party.

01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:08.480
So, you know, yeah, we're not talking about Q,

01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:12.880
but the idea that the deep state is rigging elections,

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:14.640
for example, or the idea, like all this stuff

01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:17.840
is basically just mainstream American political ideas now.

01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:24.680
So it's, you know, it's a long-standing tendency,

01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:25.880
I guess, in American politics.

01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:27.520
Like there's that essay from the 60s

01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:30.960
on the paranoid style in American politics

01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:33.200
about like the Goldwater campaign, I guess.

01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:34.960
And, you know, in the 50s and 60s,

01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:36.800
there was like the John Birch Society

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:38.440
and all this idea of, you know,

01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:40.160
like you see in Dr. Strangelove,

01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:42.080
where there's this character ranting about

01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:45.080
the fluoridation of water being a communist plot.

01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:46.080
So it's not like this is new.

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.080
Yeah, I guess our vital fluids, yeah.

01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:50.480
Yeah, the pressure is bodily fluids,

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:51.520
which I guess is kind of like a,

01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:54.800
this kind of like a predecessor to the anti-vax movement.

01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:57.400
This is the stuff I'm thinking about lately.

01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:59.280
Like I would have been an RFK voter.

01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:00.120
Yeah, completely.

01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:04.040
Have you, and yeah, the conspiracy mindset,

01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:06.480
it's not just that the literal conspiracy theories

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:07.640
have infected the Republican Party,

01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:11.440
but the sort of behavior of conspiracy hunting

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:13.200
has infected almost everybody.

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:15.320
You see Democrats or, you know,

01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:17.880
people who don't call themselves political at all,

01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:20.200
just go down these rabbit holes constantly

01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:23.920
of and undermine everything that they think they know,

01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:26.280
et cetera, with that type of thinking,

01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:30.240
even when it isn't specifically a right-wing conspiracy theory

01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:31.920
of the type that we're most used to.

01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:33.880
Yeah, it's really a style,

01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:36.080
maybe a style of, I mean, paranoid style, right?

01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:38.280
It's a style of thinking more than anything

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:40.640
that can be applied to like literally anything.

01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:42.320
I mean, I feel like it's gotten to a point

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:45.680
where any significant event that happens in American

01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:50.680
or world politics or news will be kind of,

01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:54.000
it will have like a host of theories around it

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.360
about how it's an inside job,

01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:57.400
or it's a hoax, or it's this and that, right?

01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:58.920
I think it's just become a kind of-

01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:01.680
The Kate Middleton photo is a perfect example of that, right?

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:04.360
I mean, Taylor Swift will drop an album and there's people

01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:06.400
theorizing about how she's just secretly gay,

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:08.840
and she's like, I mean, it's everything.

01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:12.200
Yeah, my friend, the very funny comedian, Sammi Mauri,

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:15.440
said that Taylor Swift is queuing on for girls.

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:16.720
That's their joke.

01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:17.880
Yeah, it's a truth.

01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:20.360
And people are like connecting the red string,

01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:22.040
like between Taylor Swift songs.

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:26.600
That is the accepted mode of consumption

01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:29.680
for the biggest mainstream pop artist in America,

01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:33.480
is to treat her like you are uncovering a vast conspiracy.

01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:35.640
Right, and she's dropping these like cryptic clues,

01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:38.240
and it's your job to like to go down the rabbit hole

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:40.120
and figure out the truth.

01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:42.360
It's, yeah, I mean, people seem to find this way

01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:46.080
of engaging with anything very, very exciting, right?

01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:48.120
I think it kind of, it puts you in the role

01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:49.720
of an investigator, right?

01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:51.360
Everyone thinks they're Sherlock Holmes,

01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:54.640
and you feel like you can find some kind of truth

01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:56.000
that has been hidden.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.200
I think that there's something,

01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:58.600
I mean, maybe this takes us back

01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:00.040
to the romance topic, actually,

01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:05.040
because in a way, that desire to like find what is concealed,

01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:08.240
or like overcome some kind of veil of illusion,

01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:10.720
I feel that that in itself is a kind of like,

01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:13.800
you know, tension and release type thing,

01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:17.360
where, you know, why is a hidden truth

01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:20.200
is more exciting than an open truth, right?

01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:21.040
Yeah.

01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:24.440
Because there's this element of pursuit of search involved.

01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:27.400
So it's exciting to discover a secret, I guess.

01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:30.560
And so people go looking for secrets anywhere.

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:33.400
I mean, I literally have just been playing a video game

01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:35.040
called Animal Well that is entirely built

01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:36.640
around the search for secrets.

01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:40.240
And that's like the, there's the motivating factor

01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:43.760
in the game, and that's sort of an odd thing to bring up,

01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:45.160
but it's literally what it reminded me of.

01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:47.520
Oh, I was doing this for fun just last week

01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:48.800
of like hunting, hunting.

01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:49.640
What does this mean?

01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:50.960
What does that mean?

01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:52.800
I love the connection, though, to,

01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:56.920
I believe you said in the video,

01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:59.920
this is just written in my list of quotes.

01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:01.360
You wrote philosophical questions

01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:03.440
that would never be definitively answered

01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:05.120
as being part of their allure, I think,

01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:07.200
and like our desire to answer them.

01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:09.000
They can't be definitively answered.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.360
So we're always questing after them.

01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:11.200
Is that correct?

01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:12.040
Am I misrepresenting you?

01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:14.720
Yeah, I think that's part of the appeal of philosophy

01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:17.200
is that there's, you know, we're asking these big questions

01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:19.960
that seem to defy definitive solution.

01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:21.760
Yeah.

01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:23.600
And so I think that is part of what's exciting about it

01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:26.160
is the desire to find out something

01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:29.120
that is, that seems like it's always eluding us.

01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:30.640
So I wanted to ask,

01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:34.120
because this is a question of perpetual fascination for me,

01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:36.640
what do you think it is that philosophy does?

01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:39.720
Because there's often, you know,

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:43.160
a realization I had after being very, very intent

01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:45.960
and fascinated by philosophy for many years,

01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:48.520
I realized, hold on a second, exactly this,

01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:50.520
none of these questions are ever answered, you know?

01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:52.960
People are still arguing with Plato and Descartes

01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:55.360
and every philosopher for hundreds of years.

01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:56.640
And so isn't that shameful

01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:58.760
that philosophy never makes progress

01:16:58.760 --> 01:16:59.800
in the way that science does?

01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:02.000
Ever had essays to that effect?

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.680
I was talking to the philosopher Quill Kukla about this

01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:07.120
and they said that what they think it indicates

01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:10.240
is that philosophy is more of an art than a science

01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:11.760
or a practice.

01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:14.320
I'm just curious how you think of it.

01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:17.680
Like what is the thing that you are trying to do

01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:20.280
when you are answering these questions

01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:22.760
if they can never be definitively answered?

01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:24.560
Well, I think it does a lot of different things.

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:27.480
One thing it maybe does is take a mystery

01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:29.440
and then clarify the mystery

01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:32.360
so that even if you don't have a definitive answer,

01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:34.080
you at least have a better understanding

01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:36.400
of what it is that you don't understand.

01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:40.400
I think another thing I can do is kind of,

01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:45.000
again, like sort of clarify concepts that are kind of murky

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:48.000
or sort of bring out something that's sort of implicit

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.800
and make it explicit in a discourse.

01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:53.200
So I mean, this I think has a potential

01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:54.960
to be useful to science, right?

01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:59.840
At least in certain fields where maybe there's a question of,

01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:04.600
I guess psychology comes to mind where,

01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:06.400
what are we talking about?

01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:08.840
When we talk about consciousness

01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:10.880
versus being unconscious,

01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:12.800
that the question actually kind of

01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:15.000
is conceptually complicated in a way

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.080
that is not clear to me,

01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:20.400
that it's easily solved just through experimentation.

01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:21.760
Before doing an experiment,

01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:24.360
you have to have a conceptual framework

01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:26.040
for what it is that you're testing.

01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:28.960
Yeah, and in fact, on this show in recent months,

01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:31.320
we've had on different neuroscientists

01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:33.560
who are arguing between themselves

01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:36.400
about whether humans have free will, et cetera.

01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:39.480
And my reaction to all of them is you have committed

01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:41.480
a philosophical error in that you don't know

01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:43.000
what you mean by the phrase free will yet,

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.240
or that's the disagreement and you won't acknowledge it.

01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:49.600
Like that sort of problem is a classic one

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:51.200
that can only be addressed by philosophy.

01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:53.440
Yeah, I don't think the question of,

01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:56.760
do humans have free will and in what sense, if so,

01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:58.920
or if not, I don't think that's a question

01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:03.480
that's going to be answered by doing functional MRI scans

01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:04.320
of the brain.

01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:06.960
There's a certain type of evidence

01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:10.240
that MRI studies are going to supply,

01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:11.600
and that certain type of evidence

01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:15.000
is always going to have to do with what amount of blood

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.880
is flowing to which brain region,

01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:19.760
which is not gonna really answer your free will question.

01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:23.200
You kind of need to like to transform that

01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:26.280
into something that can be empirically verified.

01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:28.840
I think so, but yeah, the question about free will

01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:30.640
is what do we mean by free will

01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:32.600
and what is the relationship between free will

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:37.600
and say chemistry or these seemingly deterministic

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:39.600
levels of analysis?

01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:42.680
Yeah, we might not get a final understand,

01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:45.120
we might not get a final answer to that question,

01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:46.360
but if we actually examine it,

01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:49.400
we might understand a lot more about ourselves

01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:50.600
than like all of these other things.

01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:53.280
In the same way that you're exploring twilight

01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:55.840
and you are coming to what I found fascinating conclusions

01:19:55.840 --> 01:20:00.400
about human sexuality, fantasy, genre fiction,

01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:03.880
you know, gender itself, I mean,

01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:07.800
it's just such an incredible tour de force, I don't know.

01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:10.360
Are you happy with a response to the video?

01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:13.000
Like are people, are they taking it in the way

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:13.920
that you hoped that they would?

01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:15.240
Yeah, I'm very happy with it.

01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:18.400
I think that a lot of people have given it a chance

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:22.280
and I'm always very appreciative of the kinds of comments

01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:23.800
that people leave on my videos.

01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:26.920
I feel like I am proud to have a better

01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:29.640
than average YouTube comments section.

01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:32.200
People often like write paragraphs of texts

01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:33.680
and some of it is very, very interesting.

01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:35.560
People have their own ideas and insights

01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:38.000
where people will challenge a certain point I made.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.680
I'm always very appreciative of people

01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:41.600
taking the time to do that

01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:43.480
because I know these comments just get lost

01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:45.520
in a sea of comments, but I do try,

01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:47.360
I do read a lot of them and a lot of them,

01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:49.080
unfortunately, are actually worth reading.

01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:51.640
So yeah, I'm happy about that.

01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:54.600
I mean, you really like strike me as a,

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:56.520
a philosopher from a few hundred years ago,

01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:58.120
like reading your correspondences,

01:20:58.120 --> 01:20:59.200
you know, you publish your monograph

01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:01.800
and then you get all the responses back

01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:04.040
and people debate and et cetera.

01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:09.360
It's just fascinating to see work of this caliber

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:11.600
come across on a platform that most people to write

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:15.160
as being really superficial and stupid

01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:17.920
and you're one of the most, you know,

01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:19.200
successful and popular YouTubers

01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:20.760
and you're doing honest to God philosophy

01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:22.280
and psychology and analysis on there.

01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:25.080
It's, I don't know, it's, it's incredible to see.

01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:27.400
Yeah, sorry, go.

01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:29.440
Yeah, the feedback is definitely one of the things

01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:30.520
I like about YouTube.

01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:33.160
As you say, a YouTube comment section has a reputation

01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:36.000
as being like the worst of what the internet has to offer.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.880
It certainly can be, but I think that I also, you know,

01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:40.880
it's a mix of things.

01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:42.920
Like some people just say that I'm ugly or whatever.

01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:44.080
So, okay, thank you.

01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:46.760
But, you know, I think that mixed in with that

01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:48.280
is a lot of people who are leaving

01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:50.000
actually very thoughtful ideas

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.960
and it's actually something I look forward to

01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:54.000
whenever I publish a video

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.600
is like seeing what people will say in response.

01:21:56.600 --> 01:21:59.520
It's almost like I want people to like challenge me back.

01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:02.520
Like, I want people to engage with what I'm thinking about

01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:03.760
because I know they'll come up, you know,

01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:04.920
people have different experiences,

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:06.520
they have different expertise and I do,

01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:07.640
they'll come up with a bunch of stuff

01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:08.640
that I didn't occur to me.

01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:10.640
And it's always very interesting to,

01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:12.720
to see like how other people react

01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:15.920
to like the incomplete ideas that I've had.

01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:17.880
Well, I've given you a lot of reaction here.

01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:19.400
We've been talking for quite a while.

01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:20.320
I could talk to you all day,

01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:23.160
but I should probably let you get back to it.

01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:26.400
So, yeah, I mean, thank you so much for being here, Natalie.

01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:30.960
Where else, I mean, we're talking here on YouTube,

01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:32.560
which is the platform where you're at.

01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:34.480
So I think people will be able to find you,

01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:37.400
but where else can they find the rest of your work?

01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:40.160
You can find me on Twitter and on Instagram

01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:41.400
and Patreon of course,

01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:44.680
but, you know, watch my videos for a society if you like them.

01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:46.840
On all platforms, I'm just contra points.

01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:50.640
So that's, should be pretty easy.

01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:51.920
Well, thank you so much for being here.

01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:53.400
It's been such a thrill to talk to you.

01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:54.760
Yeah, thank you so much for having me.

01:22:54.760 --> 01:22:57.040
This was a great conversation.

01:22:57.040 --> 01:22:58.720
Well, thank you once again and Natalie Wynn
