Hello and welcome to Factually. I'm Adam Conover. Thank you so much for joining me on the show

00:04.000 --> 00:10.320
again. You know, the climate situation is very bad. In order to stop a laundry list of dire

00:10.320 --> 00:15.360
consequences, we need to keep the rise in temperature to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius

00:15.360 --> 00:21.440
higher than pre-industrial times. And currently, we're on track for warming by almost 2.7 degrees

00:21.440 --> 00:28.160
by 2100. Like I said, that is bad. And given this situation, given the stunning inaction we

00:28.160 --> 00:33.600
have seen for decades, you could be forgiven for writing it all off and finding a nice hole to

00:33.600 --> 00:38.320
bury yourself in as things get worse until you die. There's an attitude a lot of people have

00:38.320 --> 00:43.440
right now that basically says the world is ending and there's nothing we can do about it. So let's

00:43.440 --> 00:50.320
all give up. But guess what? That is not true. The world is not ending. It is going to exist

00:50.320 --> 00:55.520
tomorrow, whether it's better or worse, and you are going to have to live in it. And personally,

00:55.520 --> 01:01.920
I'm too much of a fan of my life and of planet Earth itself to give up. I don't think it's an

01:01.920 --> 01:06.880
environmental position to say, oh, we're fucked. There's nothing we can do because there is always

01:06.880 --> 01:12.720
something we can do. The problem is figuring out what that is. And to answer that question,

01:12.720 --> 01:19.440
we need to understand clearly where we are, how we got here, and just what is actually possible.

01:19.440 --> 01:24.400
It's not about optimism and it's not about pessimism. It's about understanding the reality

01:24.400 --> 01:28.480
of the world we live in and what we can actually do about it. And you know what?

01:28.480 --> 01:34.160
The best cure for despair is to grab a shovel and pitch the fuck in. And our guest today

01:34.160 --> 01:38.800
is going to help us do that. She is deep in the weeds on all of the data and she has written

01:38.800 --> 01:44.640
a deeply data-informed book that we can use as a baseline to help us attack the challenges we face

01:44.640 --> 01:48.560
in creating a sustainable future. But before we get into it, I just want to remind you

02:30.000 --> 02:33.280
I know you're going to love this conversation. Please welcome Dr. Hannah Richie.

02:36.240 --> 02:38.080
Hannah, thank you so much for being on the show.

02:38.080 --> 02:40.720
No, thanks very much for having me. Looking forward to the conversation.

02:40.720 --> 02:44.880
Yeah. So you have a new book out called Not the End of the World. We're at a time where

02:45.600 --> 02:49.600
so many people talk about the world that we live in as though it's about to end.

02:49.600 --> 02:53.680
Oh, who knows if there'll even be another presidential election? Oh, who knows if

02:53.680 --> 02:57.840
a retirement? Oh, the world's not even going to be around that long. We have this fatalism

02:57.840 --> 03:02.400
about almost everything, which is, I think, a very odd viewpoint to have.

03:03.200 --> 03:06.720
It's a very interesting thing about our time that so many people feel that way.

03:07.360 --> 03:11.840
But it really seems to stem, first of all, from the climate crisis that we've, you know,

03:11.840 --> 03:18.160
I was brought up knowing, you know, watching kids' cartoons about how climate change is

03:18.160 --> 03:22.080
coming and we're ruining the planet and we have to do something. And then for the last,

03:22.080 --> 03:25.360
you know, 30 plus years of my life, I've watched very little be done.

03:25.360 --> 03:28.880
And so I understand why people would say, OK, well, that means we're screwed because I was

03:28.880 --> 03:34.240
told about this crisis as a kid and we're still not doing as much as we should be. And therefore,

03:34.240 --> 03:37.600
you know, we're going to be a member of the last generation, you hear people say.

03:38.480 --> 03:44.480
You have a new book out called Not the End of the World, which takes the opposite viewpoint

03:44.480 --> 03:49.600
in its title. I love that. Tell me about it. Why do you have that view, that it's not the end of

03:49.600 --> 03:54.240
the world? Yeah, I mean, the title is called Not the End of the World. And I think it matters how

03:54.240 --> 03:58.880
you say it. I mean, the book tackles seven big environmental problems, like I think climate

03:58.880 --> 04:04.000
change is the big one that we think of, but we face a range of other big environmental problems

04:04.000 --> 04:08.320
as well. And I think the title is not, you know, oh, it's not the end of the world. This is not a

04:08.320 --> 04:13.600
big deal. No, it's a definitive, these are massive problems, but we're going to make sure that this

04:13.600 --> 04:18.400
is not the end of the world because there are solvable problems. I mean, if we, even if we just

04:18.400 --> 04:22.960
focus on the issue of climate change, I think, you know, coming from an environmental background,

04:22.960 --> 04:27.520
working in this area for years, and, you know, also speaking to other climate scientists in this

04:27.520 --> 04:34.640
area feels like we've done a very fast 180 from, you know, not that long ago, you know, the discussion

04:34.640 --> 04:39.360
around this was, you know, is it actually happening? Are humans actually causing it? We seem to have

04:39.360 --> 04:45.840
done like a 180 towards, oh, it's too late and now there's nothing we can do. And I think, you know,

04:45.840 --> 04:49.520
I think we're kind of suffering from this kind of whiplash of, you know, what happened in the last

04:49.520 --> 04:55.280
five to 10 years that we've done a complete 180 from almost semi-denial to it's too late and there's

04:55.280 --> 05:00.080
nothing we can do. So, you know, what I try to do in the book is lay out, yes, these are, you know,

05:00.080 --> 05:05.200
massive and urgent problems. And if we don't get our act together, the consequences will be really,

05:05.200 --> 05:10.640
really catastrophic. But there is someone we can do about it. And although we aren't making progress

05:10.640 --> 05:14.800
as fast as we would want, and we're not on track for where we need to be, we are actually making

05:14.800 --> 05:19.040
progress. And we can massively accelerate that if we make the right decisions now.

05:20.400 --> 05:26.000
Do you think the view that it's too late, there's nothing we can do about it, is that, you know,

05:26.000 --> 05:30.800
another form of climate denialism? You say we've made a 180 from, oh, we're not doing it at all to

05:31.760 --> 05:36.480
it's too late. Is that just the new form of climate change denialism?

05:36.480 --> 05:41.200
I mean, I think, I mean, I think maybe some people try to push that message because they

05:41.200 --> 05:45.600
they think that it's helpful for the kind of climate denial message. I mean, I think for some

05:45.600 --> 05:50.800
people that's not their motivation. I think they generally just feel, you know, paralyzed and helpless

05:50.800 --> 05:56.160
in the massive problem. So I don't think it comes from the same place. I think the actions or the

05:56.160 --> 06:01.920
outcomes are very similar, right? Both extremes of it's not a problem or it's too late to do

06:01.920 --> 06:07.120
anything about it. Both lead to the outcome of inaction, right? They both lead us to, you know,

06:07.120 --> 06:10.880
what on one side you don't take action because there's not a problem to deal with in the first

06:10.880 --> 06:15.120
place. At the other extreme, you don't take action because it's pointless. And if we're screwed,

06:15.120 --> 06:19.280
then what's the point of doing anything anyway? So I think the outcomes of these two extremes

06:19.280 --> 06:22.240
can be the same even if the intent behind them is not.

06:23.040 --> 06:29.280
Yeah. So you say we are making progress. What are examples of that? Let's try to front load the

06:29.280 --> 06:35.760
podcast episode with some good news. How about that? What is a reason for an optimistic viewpoint?

06:35.760 --> 06:40.560
So I think if you look at the trajectory we're currently on on climate change, it's not where

06:40.560 --> 06:44.960
we need to be. Like we're on track for between two and a half to three degrees of warming. Now,

06:44.960 --> 06:51.360
that's way above our 1.5 degrees or two degrees target. But if you are looking at where we were

06:51.360 --> 06:55.760
talking about where we were headed a decade ago, you know, it was three and a half to four degrees.

06:55.760 --> 07:01.120
So that's like a degree lower than trajectory we thought we were on a decade ago. Now, it's where

07:01.120 --> 07:06.240
we are is not acceptable. But if we can make that progress in a decade, why can we not make more

07:06.240 --> 07:11.840
progress to pull two and a half degrees down to two degrees? So I think there is a bit of a good

07:11.840 --> 07:16.880
news story there. I mean, I think the most dramatic and positive change for me has been that if you

07:16.880 --> 07:22.480
look a decade ago, I was really pessimistic about where we were, because if you looked at any of the

07:22.480 --> 07:27.280
solutions we need to tackle climate change, I mean, fundamentally is we need to move away from

07:27.280 --> 07:33.840
fossil fuels to low carbon energy. The problem a decade ago is that the forms of low carbon

07:33.840 --> 07:39.680
energy we had were way more expensive than fossil fuels. So no one was going to deploy this at scale

07:39.680 --> 07:45.600
because it was way, way too expensive. Over the last 10 years or so, you know, the price of solar

07:45.600 --> 07:50.720
has fallen by 90 percent, the price of wind has fallen by 70 percent, the price of batteries and

07:50.720 --> 07:56.720
electric vehicles has fallen by about 90 percent, which means that the low carbon energy sources

07:56.720 --> 08:02.080
we need are now cheaper than fossil fuels. So you don't no longer have this, you know, this tradeoff

08:02.080 --> 08:07.760
of, you know, should we sacrifice the economy to tackle climate change? Because they're now aligned.

08:07.760 --> 08:13.600
It's actually just in our short term economic interest as well to go for the low carbon option.

08:13.600 --> 08:18.000
And I think for me, that's been the most dramatic change and the most dramatic progress we've made.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.920
Now it's really about building the stuff, right? We've pulled the prices down.

08:21.920 --> 08:24.800
Now it's about building this stuff out as quickly as we can.

08:25.760 --> 08:29.120
What I think is interesting about the answer, and you hear that a lot from,

08:30.240 --> 08:34.320
you know, folks who are really following what's happening with the climate, that the price of

08:34.320 --> 08:40.400
renewable or non-fossil fuel energy has gone down so much, that's hugely good news.

08:40.400 --> 08:45.200
What I think is interesting about that is it really is relying on, you know, the market,

08:45.200 --> 08:48.880
on capitalism, right? The price is low and therefore the good thing is going to happen.

08:49.760 --> 08:55.200
I guess what I'm curious about is what is our ability to do things that the market does not

08:55.200 --> 08:58.880
demand? You know, for instance, if I look at transportation here in the U.S., let me just

08:58.880 --> 09:03.760
give you a pessimistic case or a pessimistic example. You know, a huge amount of our emissions

09:03.760 --> 09:08.400
come from transportation. And a huge of that is because of, you know, single occupancy,

09:08.400 --> 09:14.240
passenger cars, people driving two and four in these giant pieces of metal. And, you know,

09:14.240 --> 09:18.480
if we had, for instance, you know, massively expanded public transportation in the United

09:18.480 --> 09:26.480
States, high-speed rail, passenger rail, you know, subways, etc., even just increased buses,

09:26.480 --> 09:30.720
we could massively reduce emissions. But instead, we're putting all of our change

09:30.720 --> 09:35.520
into electric vehicles, which are a marginal improvement. We're changing the engine of the car,

09:35.520 --> 09:41.040
right? And we're pushing the emissions to the power plant. But that'll be an improvement.

09:41.040 --> 09:49.200
However, even that has stalled in the last year because, A, the government has not built a massive

09:49.200 --> 09:54.640
series of electric vehicle chargers everywhere. But B, you know, the car industry is kind of like,

09:54.640 --> 09:59.680
ah, sure looks like consumers love the giant gas guzzling SUVs. That's what they prefer to buy.

09:59.680 --> 10:04.080
And who are we to tell them to buy something different? People want to buy giant, people

10:04.080 --> 10:08.320
don't even want small electric cars. When they're buying electric cars, they're buying fucking huge

10:08.320 --> 10:13.760
ones that, like, take massively more energy to move around, massively more energy to build, etc.

10:13.760 --> 10:20.240
And so, you know, reducing the price and hoping, all right, if we just make the slip go in the

10:20.240 --> 10:23.600
right direction, all the water will run the right way and we'll be moving in the right direction.

10:24.720 --> 10:29.120
That's great. But it also seems there, we have to have an ability to do things that are,

10:29.120 --> 10:33.760
that are counter to what is cheap and available, right? And do we have the ability to do that?

10:33.760 --> 10:38.160
I know that's a big question to land on you early in the podcast, but it's,

10:38.160 --> 10:42.800
it's what you made me think of. No, it's, and I largely agree with you. I think there's a couple

10:42.800 --> 10:48.080
of points there. I think I disagree that an electric car is just like a marginal improvement on a

10:48.080 --> 10:54.080
petrol or diesel one. I mean, even a big electric car, if you look at, I mean, what's, what, there's

10:54.080 --> 10:58.800
always a debate of, is an electric car actually better on carbon than a petrol or diesel? I

10:58.800 --> 11:03.600
think what's true there is that the manufacturing of the car emits more carbon, right? Because it

11:03.600 --> 11:08.720
takes more energy to build the battery than you would have on a petrol or diesel car. But once

11:08.720 --> 11:14.240
you start driving it, the, you, you pay off the carbon debt very quickly. So in the UK, for example,

11:14.240 --> 11:20.000
it pays off within two years for the average driver. And then from then on, the carbon emissions of the

11:20.000 --> 11:26.000
car are much lower. So you're talking about like a too far, up to too far reduction. And as, and

11:26.000 --> 11:30.640
that's great, but I do just want to toss in that almost everyone I know in the United States buys

11:30.640 --> 11:35.600
a new car every three years. So if you're paying it back in two years, or at least they're on a

11:35.600 --> 11:39.280
lease where they renew it every three years, so there, there's that still, still that consumer

11:39.280 --> 11:45.920
behavior problem. But please keep going. I think on that, but I think the, I'm free years seems

11:45.920 --> 11:51.040
very, very short. I mean, I think most people in the UK, at least by secondhand cars, I mean,

11:51.040 --> 11:56.480
the key point is that if they're buying a new car, their car they're selling will go to someone else

11:56.480 --> 12:00.480
that will be might be replacing a petrol or diesel car. So I think at the system level, it'll be

12:01.120 --> 12:05.680
better. If you look at the emissions of an electric car, you know, you're talking about

12:05.680 --> 12:11.040
around a too farge reduction in emissions. And actually that will get better over time, right?

12:11.040 --> 12:16.640
Countries are decarbonizing the electricity grid so that, you know, by hopefully by 2035, for

12:16.640 --> 12:21.680
example, actually the running emissions of your electric car might be zero because the US has

12:21.680 --> 12:27.200
decarbonized its electricity grid. But I take your point that I think, you know, just leaving this

12:27.200 --> 12:31.760
for the markets to run, you know, won't get us there. I think what's also really key is the

12:31.760 --> 12:36.880
time scale on which this is needed. I think, I think the economics of the energy transition

12:37.600 --> 12:44.080
are now just so good that, you know, we would just do this anyway, but we might do this over 60 or

12:44.080 --> 12:49.280
70 years and we don't have 60 or 70 years. We need to do this in a much faster timeframe,

12:49.360 --> 12:54.480
which means you do need to combine, you know, take the advantages of the free market economics,

12:54.480 --> 13:00.000
but also impose policy on top of that. I mean, even if you're looking at the really dramatic

13:00.000 --> 13:05.760
declines in the prices of solar, for example, over the last 10 or 15 years, they were initially

13:05.760 --> 13:12.000
pushed by policy, right? Some countries very early on, you know, set up R&D, set up, you know,

13:12.720 --> 13:17.920
it schemes to do this at a very high cost. And that has been like the first, you know, push

13:17.920 --> 13:24.080
that we needed in order to get these emissions out. So I think you do need this combination of

13:24.080 --> 13:29.840
policy to put, you know, accelerate these timescales. And you can also take advantage of

13:29.840 --> 13:37.440
the free market economics of it as well. I really appreciate you pushing back my rant about cars

13:37.440 --> 13:43.120
with the data that you have. And that was what I was hoping you would do, because, you know,

13:43.120 --> 13:49.440
I think you sort of, I found a little bit of my own built-in pessimism and I loved the way that

13:49.440 --> 13:55.680
you spoke to it. Do you often get a lot of pushback when you are spreading these messages?

13:55.680 --> 13:59.600
Is there a way in which, you know, the people that you're talking to, myself included,

13:59.600 --> 14:03.520
sometimes seem like we almost want to be pessimistic about this topic? Like we have a,

14:03.520 --> 14:08.880
maybe a built-in cynicism about it? A little bit. I think what I sometimes find is that

14:10.320 --> 14:17.200
for every solution we come up with, there's a, yes, but there's always a counter of like,

14:17.200 --> 14:20.880
why that solution won't work or why that solution is not good. And I think that's very healthy.

14:20.880 --> 14:24.960
Like I think if we want to find good solutions, we need to be highly critical of them.

14:24.960 --> 14:29.280
Right. We need to work out what is the good solution, what's effective, what's not effective.

14:29.280 --> 14:34.240
So we're putting our priorities and money and investment in the right places. So I think we

14:34.240 --> 14:39.600
really need this kind of critical lens to these solutions. I think what, I think for me of what's

14:39.600 --> 14:45.440
really critical in this energy transition and tackling climate change is that I think we're

14:45.440 --> 14:51.680
always hunting for the absolute perfect solution. We're looking for the solution that has no land

14:51.680 --> 14:57.760
juice, no minerals, and that's zero carbon. You know, there's zero negative impacts whatsoever.

14:57.760 --> 15:04.480
And I think the reality is that those solutions just don't exist. What we're looking for,

15:04.480 --> 15:08.240
and we need to do this quickly, we need to move away from fossil fuels quickly. So what we're

15:08.240 --> 15:14.080
looking for are solutions that are orders of magnitude better than fossil fuels. And we're

15:14.080 --> 15:18.480
having them, we have them, and we're developing them. And we need to work on the downsides of

15:18.480 --> 15:23.520
those and make sure we're not creating more damage by the solutions that we're bringing in.

15:23.520 --> 15:28.480
I think if we are to wait for the absolute perfect solution to come along, we'll just maintain our

15:28.480 --> 15:32.080
the state's quo, right? We'll just keep burning fossil fuels, and we won't be willing to move

15:32.080 --> 15:36.640
to anything else. I think we need to get a bit of the balance there where we acknowledge the

15:36.640 --> 15:43.040
downsides to some of these other technologies or other alternatives, but we try to make the most

15:43.040 --> 15:47.200
of them and we go for this transition anyway. I think that's a really good point. And it's

15:47.200 --> 15:52.480
something I think about a lot is when we are trying to change the world for the better,

15:52.480 --> 15:58.560
not letting the perfect be the enemy of the good, but while at the same time, maintaining a little

15:58.560 --> 16:05.040
bit of skepticism and criticality, because there are also folks who will sell a solution as being

16:05.040 --> 16:08.800
better than it is when we could be asking for a little bit more. And that's why, look, I'm a

16:08.800 --> 16:14.000
transportation wonk, I care about that a lot. And in my view, if we're rethinking, especially the US's

16:14.000 --> 16:19.280
transportation system, if we only change the engines that are in the vehicles, that's a missed

16:19.280 --> 16:24.000
opportunity because there's a much bigger win to be had. There's a better society to be built,

16:24.000 --> 16:27.600
and we shouldn't expect, we shouldn't accept, hey, there's a lot of people who want to sell us

16:27.600 --> 16:34.080
a bunch of fancy new cars. And if we do more, we will have an even better outcome. But at the same

16:34.080 --> 16:38.480
time, I'm not one of those people who's like, ah, it costs a lot of carbon to build the battery,

16:38.480 --> 16:44.160
so fuck it. I don't think there's a medium to be found there. I don't think everyone should go out

16:44.160 --> 16:48.160
and buy a brand new electric car every three years. I think that's excessive. But I do think, hey,

16:48.160 --> 16:52.320
if you can get a used electric car and you've driven your previous car into the ground and it's

16:52.320 --> 17:02.000
time to go ahead, et cetera, there is that medium. I'm very curious, though, you talk about how we

17:02.000 --> 17:06.480
need to find new forms of energy that are many orders of magnitude better than fossil fuels.

17:07.040 --> 17:12.400
There are some who would say, well, what if instead of finding a great new form of energy,

17:12.400 --> 17:17.680
what if we cut back? What if we just didn't waste so much? What if we didn't use so much? What if we

17:17.760 --> 17:24.080
didn't insist on so much growth, et cetera? This is sort of the degrowth movement. There's a lot

17:24.080 --> 17:31.360
of folks who have that sort of perspective, what if rather than more, we had less? And I'm curious

17:31.920 --> 17:37.280
what you think about that point of view. I mean, I think there is some room for that. I think

17:37.280 --> 17:41.760
where I'm skeptical is, I mean, trying to convince people to do that is very, very difficult.

17:41.840 --> 17:48.800
And I think we would struggle with that type of message. I mean, to come back to the policy

17:48.800 --> 17:53.760
point earlier, of course, there are things that you could do to put a cap on what we would consider

17:53.760 --> 18:03.280
a very excessive consumption. If massive SUVs are a problem, tax really big SUVs. If really

18:03.280 --> 18:10.400
frequent flying is a challenge, then set a tax on really frequent flying. I think you need to

18:10.400 --> 18:14.960
be quite careful with those policies that you don't get lots of pushback. You might get pushback

18:14.960 --> 18:19.760
if you were to put high tax on the first flight that someone takes in a given year.

18:19.760 --> 18:23.920
But you might be able to do it at much higher levels of consumption. Someone's fifth flight

18:23.920 --> 18:31.440
of the year, you start to put high tax on. I'm a stand-up comedian. I fly, I take maybe 40 flights

18:31.440 --> 18:38.640
a year. That was that last year. I easily am on the highest level of frequent flyer loyalty bonuses

18:39.200 --> 18:43.840
because it's what I do for a living. And you know what? I think I would be okay being taxed

18:43.840 --> 18:50.320
on that because I'm doing it to make money. That's how I make a living. And if I'm using the system

18:50.320 --> 18:55.840
that much, I would be happy if I knew that some amount of money that I was spending was going

18:55.840 --> 19:01.840
towards ameliorating the climate harms of the flying. But you're right. I cannot just say,

19:01.840 --> 19:06.080
hey, what if I cut back in flying a little bit? Because it's literally how I make a living.

19:06.880 --> 19:10.000
And I think a lot of folks are in the same situation. It's very difficult to ask people,

19:10.000 --> 19:13.600
hey, what if you just cut back? What if we all just cut back and have smaller lives

19:13.600 --> 19:18.240
where we're less prosperous, having less fun, enjoying life less? That's just sort of not a

19:18.240 --> 19:24.720
great pitch to people for how to solve a problem. Yeah, I don't think it's a great pitch. And I

19:24.720 --> 19:28.640
think if that's going to be your message, I don't think we'll get very far, very quickly.

19:29.280 --> 19:34.320
I mean, I'm not against the reductions in what we make called excess consumption. I think there

19:34.320 --> 19:40.240
are potential ways to do that. I think what would be difficult is how do we agree on what a

19:40.240 --> 19:45.360
level of what excessive is, right? What excessive is to you is not the same as what excessive is

19:46.080 --> 19:52.880
to me. I think there is another key part of this, which is that if we want to reduce energy

19:52.880 --> 19:58.960
consumption, a really good way to do that is just to decarbonise. I think we can talk about

19:59.680 --> 20:04.800
behaviour change and that's fine. But I think we're also underestimating how much we can reduce

20:04.800 --> 20:10.720
energy use just by getting rid of fossil fuels and by electrifying our energy systems. So if you

20:10.720 --> 20:16.640
look at, you know, if you blow up like a diagram of the US energy system today from like the fossil

20:16.640 --> 20:22.320
fuels that are burned and where that actually goes towards providing people what we call energy

20:22.320 --> 20:28.160
services. So that's like heating your home or lighting your home or, you know, the wheels turning

20:28.160 --> 20:33.840
in your car. The majority of that energy is wasted along the way. And that's because when you burn

20:33.840 --> 20:39.120
fossil fuels, most of it goes to waste heat. It doesn't actually go towards, you know, actually

20:39.120 --> 20:44.640
giving you the power that you need. Right. Which means that if you were to take fossil fuels out

20:44.640 --> 20:51.120
of the system, you would get rid of a lot of the energy use without taking anything away from the

20:51.120 --> 20:56.320
energy services or the final consumption. So your behaviours could stay exactly the same

20:56.320 --> 21:01.440
if you wanted to, but you would need much, much less energy in the system. And that just comes

21:01.440 --> 21:06.080
from getting rid of fossil fuels and then electrifying stuff like transport, for example.

21:06.080 --> 21:12.800
So if you take your gasoline car, for every dollar of gasoline you put in it,

21:12.800 --> 21:17.840
only 20 cents actually goes towards turning the wheels and moving you. The other 80 cents is just

21:17.840 --> 21:24.560
wasted. Whereas an electric car is almost the opposite. So every dollar of electricity you put

21:25.040 --> 21:30.720
in, only 20 cents is wasted. And around 80 cents goes towards turning the wheels. So actually to

21:30.720 --> 21:36.240
drive the same distance in an electric car of the same size, you might need three to four times less

21:36.240 --> 21:41.920
energy. So your behaviour hasn't changed, but you've actually massively reduced your energy

21:41.920 --> 21:46.560
consumption. So I think we also underestimate our ability to reduce energy use just by doing the

21:46.560 --> 21:52.000
decarbonisation bit. And then you can talk about individual behaviour change as a way to also supplement

21:52.880 --> 21:57.200
Okay, you're really smacking down my argument again about electric cars being a marginal

21:57.200 --> 22:01.760
improvement. It's still marginal, but it's a very large margin. I absolutely grant you that.

22:02.480 --> 22:07.280
And I agree. It's really important to look at where the actual waste is. If we're talking about

22:07.280 --> 22:12.800
flying, rather than me flying around to make a living, we could look at, for instance, private

22:12.800 --> 22:19.440
jets or that kind of thing. We could look at where the largest waste is. Maybe certain celebrities

22:19.440 --> 22:23.200
don't need to take a 15 minute flight from one airport to another. They could take a goddamn cap,

22:23.200 --> 22:28.720
you know, etc. You know, I got to confess, I have always been a sucker for Japanese treats. I love

22:28.720 --> 22:33.520
going down a little Tokyo, heading to a convenience store and grabbing all those brightly coloured,

22:33.520 --> 22:38.000
fun packaged boxes off of the shelf. But you know what? I don't get the chance to go down there

22:38.000 --> 22:42.480
as often as I would like to. And that is why I am so thrilled that Bokksu, a Japanese snack

22:42.480 --> 22:47.280
subscription box, chose to sponsor this episode. What's got me so excited about Bokksu is that

22:47.280 --> 22:51.840
these aren't just your run-of-the-mill grocery store finds. Each box comes packed with 20 unique

22:51.840 --> 22:57.120
snacks that you can only find in Japan itself. Plus, they throw in a handy guide filled with

22:57.120 --> 23:01.200
info about each snack and about Japanese culture. And let me tell you something. You are going to

23:01.200 --> 23:05.360
need that guide because this box comes with a lot of snacks. I just got this one today,

23:05.360 --> 23:11.360
direct from Bokksu, and look at all of these things. We got some sort of seaweed snack here.

23:11.360 --> 23:17.760
We've got a buttercream cookie. We've got a dolce. I'm going to have to read the guide to

23:17.760 --> 23:22.000
figure out what this one is. It looks like some sort of sponge cake. Oh my gosh. This one is,

23:22.000 --> 23:29.200
I think it's some kind of maybe fried banana chip. Let's try it out and see. Is that what it is?

23:31.600 --> 23:37.600
Nope. It's not banana. Maybe it's a cassava potato chip. I should have read the guide. Ah,

23:37.600 --> 23:42.880
here they are. Iburigako smoky chips. Potato chips made with rice flour, providing a lighter

23:42.880 --> 23:47.680
texture and satisfying crunch. Oh my gosh. This is so much fun. You got to get one of these for

23:47.680 --> 23:52.400
themselves and get this for the month of March. Bokksu has a limited edition cherry blossom box

23:52.400 --> 23:57.040
and 12 month subscribers get a free kimono style robe and get this while you're wearing your new

23:57.040 --> 24:01.600
duds learning fascinating things about your tasty snacks. You can also rest assured that you have

24:01.600 --> 24:07.200
helped to support small family run businesses in Japan because Bokksu works with 200 plus

24:07.200 --> 24:11.760
small makers to get their snacks delivered straight to your door. So if all of that sounds good,

24:11.760 --> 24:16.160
if you want a big box of delicious snacks like this for yourself, use the code factually for

24:16.160 --> 24:23.040
$15 off your first order at Bokksu.com. That's code factually for $15 off your first order on Bokksu.com.

24:23.840 --> 24:28.880
Okay. I want to talk about some of the other crises that you mentioned. I just want to ask

24:28.880 --> 24:34.560
you one more question on this first about the price going down because there's also a phenomenon

24:34.560 --> 24:39.200
when things get more efficient and the price goes down, we do tend to use more of them. I think about

24:40.720 --> 24:46.720
LED lights, which are massively more efficient than every other form of light ever made,

24:47.520 --> 24:51.680
but the result is that people are using, and businesses especially are using a lot more

24:51.680 --> 24:56.240
LED lights because, hey, guess what? We can now have 10 times the lights for the same cost or

24:56.240 --> 25:04.800
whatever. So why not leave them running all the time because they're just LEDs? Is that at all an

25:04.800 --> 25:10.960
issue in, hey, the price of moving, the price of heating your home goes down, the price of lighting

25:10.960 --> 25:15.360
goes down, the price of all these things go down? Does that just mean we'll use more of them, not less?

25:16.240 --> 25:23.120
I think there's two angles to this. I think one angle is looking at a large part of the world

25:23.200 --> 25:28.320
where a big constraint is just they cannot afford energy. People that don't have much heating or

25:28.320 --> 25:34.160
lighting or air con, and actually just a big everyday struggle for them is, how do I get

25:34.160 --> 25:40.320
access to energy? And for those people, a reduction in energy prices is a massive benefit. They might

25:40.320 --> 25:45.760
get energy for the first time. They might get vital energy services that we have enjoyed for a long

25:45.760 --> 25:51.520
time. So I think for them, low energy prices is just a benefit. And actually, we should be supportive

25:51.520 --> 25:54.480
of the fact that their energy use might increase because it will mask the increase.

25:54.480 --> 25:57.120
That is a great point. That's a great point. Thank you.

25:57.680 --> 26:02.080
And then I think when we're talking about, for example, people in the US or the UK,

26:02.080 --> 26:07.600
like richer countries, I think this effect that you describe is what we call the Jevons paradox,

26:08.640 --> 26:13.840
whereas the price of something falls or as efficiency improves, you use more of it.

26:14.480 --> 26:20.160
Now, there are a range of studies trying to look at how big this, we call it the rebound effect,

26:20.160 --> 26:26.960
how big the rebound is. And most tend to find that there is some rebound, right? So you do

26:26.960 --> 26:33.440
undo some of the improvements that you get in efficiency, for example, but they rarely rebound

26:33.440 --> 26:40.160
more than 100%, right? So they might rebound 50%. So rather than getting the full 100% of the

26:40.160 --> 26:45.760
efficiency gains, because you use more, you might only get 50%. So it's not as good as you might

26:45.760 --> 26:51.680
initially expect just from the numbers, but it's often not so much that you use more energy

26:51.680 --> 26:58.800
than you did before. So LEDs is a good example where people after getting LEDs, you did just use

26:58.800 --> 27:03.680
more lights or you left them on or you might have installed more in your home. But actually,

27:03.680 --> 27:08.800
energy use for lighting in the US has still gone down so that the rebound wasn't 100%,

27:08.800 --> 27:11.760
but we did undo some of those gains because we use more.

27:12.400 --> 27:16.880
Yeah. Well, and I was thinking about reading studies about light pollution that like light

27:16.880 --> 27:22.160
pollution has, if you're an astronomer or someone who cares about bats,

27:23.120 --> 27:27.280
like you might not be happy about LEDs because we're using more, but I'm glad to hear that the

27:28.000 --> 27:32.320
energy use has gone down. I love knowing the name of that, the Jervins paradox. I hadn't heard

27:32.320 --> 27:40.720
that before. Oh, Jevins. Yeah, Jevins paradox. That's really cool. This is great. I love that I

27:40.720 --> 27:45.360
keep standing up these arguments for you and you keep knocking them down so ably. You're my

27:45.360 --> 27:51.120
favorite kind of guest. You say that climate change is only one of many types of environmental

27:51.760 --> 27:54.080
problem that we have facing us. What are some of the others?

27:54.080 --> 28:00.800
I mean, I think another big one is air pollution where globally estimates, there are a range of

28:00.800 --> 28:05.600
estimates of how many people die prematurely from air pollution every year, but they're all in the

28:05.600 --> 28:12.000
millions. And the World Health Organization, for example, estimates that around 7 million premature

28:12.000 --> 28:18.000
deaths every year from air pollution, which is a massive deal. And there's two problems of air

28:18.000 --> 28:24.560
pollution there. One is what we call indoor air pollution. And that's people typically on much

28:24.560 --> 28:29.840
lower incomes, where actually the only sources of energy they have are like wood or charcoal.

28:30.400 --> 28:36.000
And they burn leaves in their home for heating or cooking fuels, and then they inhale the smoke.

28:36.000 --> 28:39.920
And that's really, really bad for human health. So they have millions of deaths from that.

28:40.480 --> 28:45.360
And then we have millions of deaths from outdoor air pollution. So that's stuff from our cars,

28:45.360 --> 28:50.880
power plants, for example, industry. And again, millions of people die there prematurely every

28:50.880 --> 28:57.360
year from that source of pollution. So for me, you were to quantify deaths from environmental

28:57.440 --> 29:02.560
problems today, like air pollution would be very much top of the list. And it's something we

29:02.560 --> 29:07.440
can have in the back of our mind, but don't really think about. Yeah. I mean, it's completely insane

29:07.440 --> 29:12.080
that when we look at the toll of our energy system, it's one that we don't often keep in mind,

29:12.080 --> 29:18.320
because it's sort of like an invisible death toll. Again, transportation causing emissions,

29:18.320 --> 29:22.320
even if you just look at deaths from our transportation system, we think of car crashes,

29:22.960 --> 29:27.120
people being hit by buses or whatever. We don't think about the number of people who

29:27.120 --> 29:32.800
are dying of respiratory illnesses that they got because they live 800 feet from a freeway,

29:32.800 --> 29:36.800
as many people do here in Los Angeles where I live. I mean, there's like some federal regulation

29:36.800 --> 29:40.400
that says you're not supposed to build a home within X number of feet of a freeway.

29:40.400 --> 29:44.640
And in Los Angeles, something like, I don't know, a huge percentage, like 40% of homes

29:44.640 --> 29:49.600
are in violation of this because we have freeways everywhere. There's just so much air pollution.

29:49.600 --> 29:53.440
And so people are dying left and right of respiratory diseases, but that doesn't hit the

29:53.440 --> 30:00.880
news. It doesn't say, hey, a five-year-old child with asthma killed or a person dies at 65 when

30:00.880 --> 30:06.480
they would have died at 90 because of air pollution in the same way that a car crash does.

30:06.480 --> 30:14.000
And yet, those deaths are caused by the same thing. Yeah, exactly. And I mean, this is another

30:14.000 --> 30:20.000
what we call an externality of burning fossil fuels. And that works in the same way as climate.

30:20.000 --> 30:26.160
The CO2 emissions and the damages from climate change are like an externality, a kind of cost to

30:26.160 --> 30:31.200
society, a social cost and environmental cost that isn't factored into the price of fossil fuels

30:31.200 --> 30:35.120
when you burn them. And it's the same for air pollution. That's exactly the same thing. This

30:35.120 --> 30:41.920
is a kind of hidden externality that we just don't really think about. I mean, again, I like to

30:41.920 --> 30:46.960
highlight that these problems are solvable problems. They're tractable problems. I mean,

30:46.960 --> 30:53.120
if you were to look across a range of especially high-income countries, we have actually made

30:53.120 --> 30:58.400
progress on reducing air pollution over the last few decades. The US Clean Air Act has been really

30:58.400 --> 31:03.920
successful in reducing emissions of these gases. The same in the UK. We've seen a really rapid

31:03.920 --> 31:10.560
decline. There's still an unacceptable number of people dying from this, but we can make progress

31:10.560 --> 31:15.840
when we put the right policies in place and we make these transitions. I guess the key challenge

31:15.840 --> 31:20.240
there is that most people dying from air pollution today live kind of in middle-income

31:20.240 --> 31:25.280
countries that have industrialized very, very quickly, but they've done that by burning fuels,

31:25.280 --> 31:32.080
especially very close to city centers. So Delhi, for example, Beijing was one where if you were to

31:32.080 --> 31:38.400
go to Beijing a decade or so ago, really, really heavily polluted. Over the last decade, it's made

31:38.400 --> 31:44.080
amazing progress in reducing air pollution and added years onto the lives of its citizens.

31:44.080 --> 31:49.120
So I like to highlight that these are massive problems, but they are also tractable ones and

31:49.120 --> 31:54.000
they are ones that we can make progress on. And what are some of the other environmental

31:54.000 --> 31:57.520
challenges? I love hearing this. I love hearing a problem and then a solution right after it.

31:59.600 --> 32:04.640
I mean, I think a big one is our food systems. I think people massively underestimate the

32:04.640 --> 32:09.360
environmental impacts of our food systems. I mean, I think there's almost no environmental problem

32:09.360 --> 32:14.800
where food isn't either a big player or completely dominates the impacts. I mean,

32:14.800 --> 32:20.080
it contributes around between a quarter and a third of greenhouse gas emissions for climate change.

32:21.120 --> 32:25.680
It's the leading driver of deforestation. It's the leading driver of biodiversity loss.

32:25.680 --> 32:30.400
It's the biggest user of fresh water. I mean, I think when we think about fresh water,

32:30.400 --> 32:36.240
we think about taking a shower or brushing our teeth. It's farming is the biggest user of water.

32:36.800 --> 32:41.120
It's the leading driver of water pollution. So there's a really long list of environmental

32:41.120 --> 32:46.240
problems where food and what we eat and how we produce it really sits at the center of that.

32:46.240 --> 32:53.920
Yeah. And so how do we solve this? Because some people are watching this or listening to this

32:53.920 --> 33:00.320
going, vegan, we should all be vegan. And what a wonderful world that would be. And I've eaten

33:00.320 --> 33:07.040
vegan for long periods for many times in my life. And yet I do not believe that we are going to solve

33:07.040 --> 33:14.880
this problem by convincing every single person to go vegan one by one in the way that a religious

33:14.880 --> 33:19.760
proselytizer might, that folks who are doing that are doing the Lord's work good on you. But I don't

33:19.760 --> 33:25.520
think we're going to solve the problem that way. And I also think that eating organic,

33:25.520 --> 33:31.040
eating local, small scale farms, very nice for folks who can afford it. But we need a system,

33:31.040 --> 33:34.880
a food system that can feed what seven billion people at this point, eight billion we're on our

33:34.880 --> 33:40.240
way to. Eight, excuse me, thank you. I always forget how many billions. Because when I was a kid,

33:40.240 --> 33:45.280
let me just say, one of the fucking weirdest things in my entire life is I remember being in

33:45.280 --> 33:50.800
high school and being told there are six billion people on earth. And then I remember 10 years

33:50.800 --> 33:55.040
later, it was like, hey, now it's seven. And I was like, how there's a billion more people

33:56.480 --> 34:03.280
when I was just like, you know, when I was like watching DVDs and, you know, like taking the

34:03.280 --> 34:10.000
bus home from school, like how did what a massive change. And yet everything looks the same to me

34:10.000 --> 34:15.280
when I'm walking down the street. It's bizarre. And now we're now we have eight. So we've added

34:16.000 --> 34:21.440
a quarter as many people or third as many people has already existed when I was a kid.

34:21.440 --> 34:26.080
In the last couple of decades, we got to feed all of them. So, you know, how the hell can we

34:26.080 --> 34:30.480
have a food system that feeds these people food that they want to eat without destroying the environment?

34:30.480 --> 34:35.840
So I think there's, I think there's two big solutions or things we need to do here.

34:35.840 --> 34:41.040
I think the very first, the first one is we just, we need to produce food very, very efficiently.

34:41.120 --> 34:47.840
And by that, we need high crop yields. Now, if you go back to, you know, the 1960s or the 1970s,

34:47.840 --> 34:52.400
you know, the big crisis at that point, and what people were talking about was the world running

34:52.400 --> 34:58.720
out of food, right? We saw this really rapid increase in the global population. And basically,

34:58.720 --> 35:03.600
conclusion was, there's no way that we will be able to feed everyone. And then, you know, there

35:03.600 --> 35:10.560
was the, the population bomb was the book that came out in 1968 by Paul R. Erlich. And that predicted,

35:10.560 --> 35:15.280
you know, just, we're just going to have so many millions of people dying from famine and just

35:15.280 --> 35:19.360
wouldn't be able to feed everyone. And that hasn't come true. And that hasn't come true because we

35:19.360 --> 35:25.120
had what we call the Green Revolution, where we just see crop yields across the world just skyrocket.

35:25.120 --> 35:29.520
You know, you're getting doubling, tripling, quadrupling of crop yields, which means that

35:29.520 --> 35:34.240
despite having, you know, billions more people, the amount of food we produce per person has

35:34.240 --> 35:38.800
still gone up. You know, we've seen a massive increase. I mean, going forward, that's also

35:38.880 --> 35:43.680
really key. What happens if you increase crop yields is you obviously get more food. But the

35:43.680 --> 35:49.280
key point is you, you grow it on less land, which means you need to cut down less forests. You need

35:49.280 --> 35:55.040
to, you know, go into less wild habitats. You can, you can use much less land for farming. So that's

35:55.040 --> 36:01.440
number one. And then number two is just, we just need to see massive global dietary change.

36:02.640 --> 36:08.480
The biggest impact by far of our food systems is, is, is meat and dairy consumption. And we do need

36:08.560 --> 36:14.400
to find a way of reducing that. But I, I completely agree with you that I think the, the message of

36:14.400 --> 36:19.360
we just all need to go vegan tomorrow is just like not going to work. Yeah. And actually,

36:19.360 --> 36:25.840
how do we, I'm fascinated to hear you say that then because I, I agree. I agree with both points,

36:25.840 --> 36:31.120
right? And so how do we square that circle? How do we reduce, and by the way, in the last couple

36:31.120 --> 36:36.960
years, there's been a huge amount of interest in meat replacement foods. There was like a brief

36:37.040 --> 36:41.200
fad for them in the United States. For a couple of years, I was buying impossible burgers and

36:41.200 --> 36:46.960
beyond burgers. And now I never want to eat one of those things for as long as I live. Like I,

36:46.960 --> 36:54.240
I ate so many impossible burgers that I can like picture the taste like, and it repulses me at

36:54.240 --> 36:58.800
this point. And, you know, God willing, they come up with a different version that, that tastes a

36:58.800 --> 37:02.400
little different and is a little bit more of an actual replacement. But, you know, unfortunately,

37:02.400 --> 37:08.800
that industry turned out to not have the results that it promised investors and the public. So

37:09.840 --> 37:13.920
what, yeah, what do we do to reduce meat consumption if all those things we sort of

37:13.920 --> 37:18.560
are agreed might not be the answer? I mean, I think the, I mean, I think I should say that I think,

37:18.560 --> 37:23.920
I think food is way harder to tackle than energy. I think on energy, I think people,

37:24.560 --> 37:29.360
for the most part, they just want, you know, cheap energy coming out of the socket, right? And if

37:29.360 --> 37:34.400
you can provide that for them, they don't really care where it comes from. For food, people really

37:34.400 --> 37:38.960
care about what they eat. And it's like a such a strong part of the identity and their freedom,

37:38.960 --> 37:43.120
right? Try to tell someone what to eat and they will immediately push back, which is why I think

37:43.120 --> 37:48.000
this is a much harder problem to tackle. Yeah. I mean, I think the, I mean, I think the key thing

37:48.000 --> 37:53.440
there is trying to sell it to someone is all or nothing. Like you either eat meat or you don't

37:53.440 --> 37:58.480
eat meat is not going to work, right? I think you need to find a way of reducing meat consumption

37:58.480 --> 38:03.200
or giving people options to reduce meat consumption and starting there. And then they might progress

38:03.200 --> 38:07.360
towards, you know, a more and more plant-based diet over time. I think you're not going to get that

38:07.360 --> 38:15.040
overnight. I mean, I think for me, I think we will need to rely on solutions that produce

38:15.040 --> 38:19.760
almost complete mimics of meat that we're currently eating. I guess I'm probably pretty

38:19.760 --> 38:24.880
pessimistic that people just accept, you know, we'll just eat beans and lentils and that'll be fine.

38:24.880 --> 38:28.800
I think for most people, they basically want a substitute for meat, which means we need to

38:28.800 --> 38:33.440
produce meat without the animal. And there are innovations coming through on this. The problem

38:33.440 --> 38:38.800
is that they are currently too expensive and we haven't scaled them yet. Are you correct?

38:38.800 --> 38:44.240
Yeah. I've read accounts of the current state of lab-grown meat where they're like

38:44.240 --> 38:51.280
sort of making like a lattice of animal cells, like very painstakingly in a lab and like one on

38:51.280 --> 38:56.160
top of the other and like, okay, we've made the perfect artificial steak and it only costs

38:56.160 --> 39:04.000
$100,000 a pound or whatever. It's like encouraging work, but it's not really close to market yet.

39:04.000 --> 39:10.640
Is that right? Yeah. I mean, I think the costs are falling pretty rapidly still. I mean, yeah,

39:10.640 --> 39:15.280
$100,000 would have been, you know, the price, you know, maybe a decade or so ago, but they've

39:15.280 --> 39:20.720
fallen quite fast since then. And actually, I think on cost, they might be competitive,

39:20.720 --> 39:26.160
you know, in the next five or so years. Really? I mean, the scalability will be the problem. It's

39:26.160 --> 39:31.920
like how you then take that, you know, really fine, your created process and scale that up,

39:31.920 --> 39:35.760
you know, to produce hundreds of millions of tons of meat. I mean, that will be the big problem

39:36.320 --> 39:42.160
rather than the economics of it. Yeah. And we also have the problem with the food system of

39:42.160 --> 39:47.920
people's health. I mean, as you say, since, you know, the population bomb was written in the last

39:48.000 --> 39:53.440
50 years, there's been this enormous explosion of food production, which is great sort of

39:53.440 --> 39:57.200
demographically, right? If you're looking at, okay, we produced enough food for all of these

39:57.200 --> 40:03.040
8 billion people. But if you look at at least, you know, the dietary health of people in the

40:03.040 --> 40:09.360
United States, it is poor. And you have to lay some of that at the feet of our food system.

40:09.360 --> 40:13.840
It's not people need to make better choices. It's people need better choices in the supermarket.

40:13.840 --> 40:19.360
The food that is being rammed down people's throats is not what it should be because of,

40:20.320 --> 40:25.520
I would say the pressures of capitalism on these food producers to make food more cheaply and etc.

40:26.720 --> 40:32.560
And so, you know, we have this explosion in the number of calories we're creating, but there

40:32.560 --> 40:38.880
may be not the calories that are best for people's health. And I could imagine something similar

40:38.880 --> 40:44.240
happening if we have our meat substituted, like we probably need, you know, some amount

40:44.240 --> 40:49.120
of regulations in place or somebody thinking about like, let's make sure we shape this system

40:49.120 --> 40:52.880
so that we're not producing, you know, we're feeding people and we're also not feeding them

40:52.880 --> 40:58.080
shit, right? Yeah, no, I agree. I think the quality of the meat substitutes or, you know,

40:58.080 --> 41:04.480
whatever we replace it with will be really important. And to some extent, that could be

41:04.560 --> 41:12.400
another lever to encourage people to move away from particular products. Like I think as I was

41:12.400 --> 41:17.440
saying, I think the transition in food is a much harder sell for people. But what people really

41:17.440 --> 41:22.560
care about is their health. So if we can produce products that are one more environmentally friendly

41:22.560 --> 41:28.320
and also better for people's health, that could be another lever to encourage people to make that

41:28.320 --> 41:34.240
transition. I mean, I think there are a range of studies looking at, you know, the health benefits

41:34.320 --> 41:38.000
of moving to a more plant-based diet doesn't necessarily mean a completely plant-based

41:38.000 --> 41:44.080
diet, but a more plant-based diet. And they tend to result in slightly better health outcomes

41:44.080 --> 41:49.280
for people. And that might not be because necessarily they're eating less meat. But I think

41:49.280 --> 41:54.080
often when people transition to a more plant-based diet, they automatically increase the diversity

41:54.080 --> 41:58.720
of foods that they're eating, right? Like they diversify different meals, they eat a bit more

41:58.720 --> 42:04.000
veg, a bit more fruit, a bit more of various different foods. So overall, the quality of

42:04.000 --> 42:08.640
their diet might improve and diversify. So I think that the health lens of this is also really,

42:08.640 --> 42:16.160
really critical. Yeah. And when I think you can make the argument to people, hey, if you eat less

42:16.160 --> 42:21.520
meat, if you diversify your diet, you're going to be healthier. That is an appealing message to

42:21.520 --> 42:29.200
people, you know, people want to feel better about what they eat. And I think if we sort of

42:29.200 --> 42:38.400
abandon the monkish devotion to, I never again shall meat pass my lips. And that's fine for those

42:38.400 --> 42:41.920
who want to make that moral commitment. I think that's a wonderful moral commitment to make and

42:41.920 --> 42:48.400
I support it. But if we can focus on reducing, diversifying for everybody in general, we can

42:48.400 --> 42:54.800
make huge, huge gains without requiring people to, without requiring people to give up so much if

42:54.800 --> 42:59.360
they don't want to. Is that sort of what it is? Yeah, exactly. I think for a lot of people,

43:00.320 --> 43:05.440
even that first step would seem overwhelming. You know, how on earth do I eat a vegan diet?

43:05.440 --> 43:11.040
Like what do I eat? And I actually think as you graduate, as people are gradually exposed

43:11.040 --> 43:15.760
towards, you know, eating a bit less meat or substituting, you know, one meal, you know,

43:15.760 --> 43:22.000
a day or a day a week for a more plant-based diet, they then start to learn stuff that they can eat.

43:22.000 --> 43:26.640
And oh, I actually quite like this substitute or I like this different meal that I've made.

43:26.640 --> 43:31.120
I think then they become more comfortable with it over time and might be able to take it further.

43:31.120 --> 43:35.840
But I think the overwhelm initially of, okay, I suddenly have to eat a completely vegan diet,

43:35.840 --> 43:41.680
you know, really puts people off. So I think we need to take people on baby steps along the way.

43:41.680 --> 43:46.480
And then they might end up a vegan diet at the end of the road. But I think most people will not

43:46.480 --> 43:53.200
jump immediately to that. Yeah. I mean, my own thing was like 10 years ago, I read a book by

43:53.200 --> 43:58.400
the cookbook author, Mark Bitman, called Vegan Before Six, where he had, he's like,

43:58.400 --> 44:02.240
here's my diet plan. I eat vegan before 6 p.m. and then I have whatever I want for dinner.

44:02.240 --> 44:07.120
And I did that for a year or two. And then I just sort of learned, oh, here's a bunch of vegan

44:07.120 --> 44:12.080
meals I can make myself. And so now I eat vegan quite often. Not, I'm not a permanent vegan,

44:12.080 --> 44:16.240
but like, you know, more often than not, I'm like, oh, let me try to have a vegan meal today.

44:16.960 --> 44:23.520
And I think getting that sort of muscle memory into people so that they know how to do it enables

44:23.520 --> 44:29.760
them to make those choices, et cetera. Now, vegans in the comments, I know you're yelling,

44:29.760 --> 44:33.840
everyone should just go vegan. It's fine. Like keep doing what you're doing. But we are trying to

44:34.480 --> 44:38.560
get as many people under the tent as possible. And having a little bit of allowance for where

44:38.560 --> 44:43.120
people are currently at, I think, helps us do that, right? Yeah, exactly. I mean, I've had this

44:43.120 --> 44:50.640
dilemma myself. So I'm now a vegan. And I wasn't, you know, three years or so ago. And I've actually

44:50.640 --> 44:56.480
questioned over the years, am I more effective in this role as a vegan, or as someone that's not a

44:56.480 --> 45:01.040
vegan, but strongly encourages, you know, meat reduction? Like I sometimes have this kind of

45:01.600 --> 45:06.240
block of if I, you know, people find out I'm a vegan, you know, they don't take my message

45:06.240 --> 45:11.680
seriously, or they think I'm like way too extreme. Or, you know, they can't visualize how they would

45:11.680 --> 45:17.040
get from where they are to where I am. Whereas if I was someone that, you know, didn't eat meat that

45:17.040 --> 45:22.320
often, maybe didn't eat beef, ate some chicken or fish, they might find that more relatable. And

45:22.320 --> 45:28.720
therefore they might actually feel like there was a shorter gap between where they are and where I am.

45:28.720 --> 45:33.440
I mean, in the end, I just went vegan anyway. But I have questioned, you know, what's the most

45:33.440 --> 45:40.480
effective, you know, communication strategy there or where to place yourself to reach a bigger cohort

45:40.480 --> 45:46.080
of people? Yeah, it does. It is funny that if you're talking to a vegan, and you're feeling bad about

45:46.080 --> 45:52.240
yourself, and then they reveal, I eat fish sometimes, and you're like, Oh, oh, thank God. Oh, okay,

45:52.240 --> 45:56.080
all right, okay. So there's, there's some hope for me yet, you know, like it, it's just having,

45:56.640 --> 46:04.000
having a little bit of flex, like makes people a little bit relieved. So I really love that

46:04.000 --> 46:09.760
we're making progress in so many areas. I am curious, though, are there any areas where we're

46:09.760 --> 46:16.000
putting a lot of effort into reducing our carbon emissions that are not so effective? That, you

46:16.000 --> 46:20.640
know, are things that, you know, hey, we should direct our efforts elsewhere? Are there any

46:20.640 --> 46:26.320
current initiatives that you are a skeptic about? I mean, I think the, I think on, on climate change

46:26.320 --> 46:31.440
specifically, I mean, I think the, the issue there is that I think there's a lot of people that are

46:31.440 --> 46:36.320
really well intentioned. They want to make a difference. They want to cut their carbon footprint,

46:36.320 --> 46:40.880
but they don't have good information to base that on. And they often misplace their effort.

46:41.840 --> 46:46.160
And the issue there is that they do the stuff that has a really tiny impact or sometimes a negative

46:46.160 --> 46:51.280
impact. And then they miss the really big stuff. So when you look, for example, if you look at

46:51.280 --> 46:55.280
surveys, you know, asking people, you know, what's the best thing you can do for the environment,

46:55.280 --> 46:59.440
or the best thing you can do to cut your carbon footprint, they mentioned stuff like recycling,

47:00.080 --> 47:05.440
or, you know, reusing a plastic bag or turning off the lights. And, and these are, you know,

47:05.440 --> 47:10.240
fine to do, do them, but they're small in the magnitude of things. And actually they miss the

47:10.320 --> 47:15.600
stuff, like adopting a more plant based diet, or, or they even miss stuff like, you know,

47:15.600 --> 47:20.160
switching to the electric car. So they, they're focusing on the really tiny stuff and putting

47:20.160 --> 47:25.120
effort in there, and then missing the really big stuff. And what I think was really key is if we're

47:25.120 --> 47:30.240
to have a hope of tackling this, you know, we're past the stage of the little stuff, right? We need

47:30.240 --> 47:36.080
to be focusing on the big stuff. So I think that's the issue that people have is also often

47:36.080 --> 47:40.720
misplaced effort, when there's actually a list of, you know, maybe five big things that really

47:40.720 --> 47:47.680
matter. And then the rest is more like a rounding error. Yeah. Well, recycling is such a contentious

47:47.680 --> 47:54.400
one, because a lot of people have an awareness that, you know, recycling, at least how it's

47:54.400 --> 48:02.480
practiced in the US is, in many ways, a bit of a PR attempt by the plastics industry to,

48:02.480 --> 48:07.280
you know, distract from the waste that they caused. Hey, if we put that little triangle on

48:07.280 --> 48:11.600
the thing and say it's recyclable, then people will think, Oh, it's not so bad to buy one,

48:11.600 --> 48:15.760
and it'll remove the guilt from them. And then we'll shift the burden of being responsible

48:15.760 --> 48:20.480
onto the consumer. Now, I don't, I believe all that is true. I know all that is true. I've,

48:20.480 --> 48:26.640
I've studied it and done content on it myself. But that doesn't stop me from throwing all that

48:26.640 --> 48:30.320
shit in the blue bin, blue bin, because, Hey, why not? If some of us being recycled, whatever,

48:30.320 --> 48:35.040
I don't stress out about it too much. But I think that that breeds a cynicism in people that, Hey,

48:35.040 --> 48:39.600
these solutions that we're being presented are capitalist schemes by people who are trying

48:39.600 --> 48:46.080
to get us to buy more. And I don't know. I think that is what leads a lot of people to say, Oh,

48:46.080 --> 48:50.640
we're never going to solve this problem unless we do something about our economic system overall,

48:50.640 --> 48:56.240
that we change its structure. And, you know, that we have a rapacious economic system that is

48:56.240 --> 49:01.920
gobbling everything up, that always wants more demands, endless growth, mines the planet for

49:01.920 --> 49:09.040
resources, mines our labor to reduce it to its lowest possible cost, and is just, you know,

49:09.040 --> 49:14.960
a fire that's consuming the planet until it's all gone. That's a very apocalyptic view. But I'm

49:14.960 --> 49:20.560
curious what you think about, you know, our economic system itself and how it contributes to the

49:20.560 --> 49:28.080
problem or if we can actually solve it under capitalism? I mean, I think that was a lot.

49:29.760 --> 49:33.680
I like to give a lot at this point in the conversation. I'm sensing you're a big fan of

49:33.680 --> 49:39.760
capitalism. No, I think, I think, I think those are all very valid points. I mean, I think it's

49:39.760 --> 49:46.320
very fair to say that capitalism has got us into this mess. Release has played a massive role in

49:46.320 --> 49:55.200
getting us into this mess. I think you can still make the argument that it can play some role in

49:55.200 --> 50:01.520
getting us out of it now. Or at least another way I'd frame it is that to me, I'm not sure we have

50:01.520 --> 50:09.280
a choice at this stage of trying to utilize some of the positives of capitalism, which, you know,

50:09.280 --> 50:15.120
we discussed earlier, the kind of free market economics of energy costs and technological

50:15.120 --> 50:20.320
change. I think that's like one benefit of this. There are obviously still massive downsides. The

50:20.320 --> 50:28.720
question is, can you garner the benefits of the system, but also try to address and pull down

50:28.720 --> 50:35.360
some of the downsides of the system? Right. To me, that seems more realistic than deciding,

50:35.360 --> 50:39.520
we're just going to rip up the system and build a new one, especially on the timescales that we're

50:39.520 --> 50:43.280
talking about here, right? We're talking about tackling this, you know, we need to really get

50:43.280 --> 50:47.040
moving on. I mean, we should have got moving on this 20 years ago, but now we really need to get

50:47.040 --> 50:52.320
moving on this. And we're talking about, you know, decarbonizing our electricity grids in the UK

50:52.320 --> 51:00.640
or the US in five to 10 years. And I'm skeptical that we can tear down an economic system and

51:00.640 --> 51:06.000
build a new one on that timescale. Maybe if we're talking about this over 70 years, then we might

51:06.000 --> 51:11.120
have a way of, you know, working on our economic system first, and then deciding how we tackle our

51:11.120 --> 51:16.800
environmental problems later. So I think we, in some sense, are stuck in the economic system

51:16.800 --> 51:21.600
that we're in. But that doesn't mean we need to accept all of the, all of the aspects of it,

51:21.600 --> 51:26.400
or just accept it as the status quo. I think there are things we can do within that system

51:26.400 --> 51:31.840
to, to utilize the benefits and try to push down some of the major downsides of it.

51:32.480 --> 51:38.960
I agree with you entirely. I mean, I'm a critic of our economic system. And I agree that capitalism

51:38.960 --> 51:44.880
has gotten us into this mess. And I'm a person who is constantly wanting to envision something

51:44.880 --> 51:51.280
better. However, I don't think that we can, we have time to wait, you know, I don't think we

51:51.280 --> 51:55.680
have time to say, Hey, let's, let's figure out the economic system first and then deal with climate

51:55.680 --> 52:01.520
change. We can do both things at once. And, you know, we can be realists about the world that

52:01.520 --> 52:06.480
we live in and try to make, you know, the changes that we need to make in that world under the

52:06.480 --> 52:13.280
system that we're in, as we also try to envision a better system and, and build it. And, you know,

52:13.280 --> 52:18.160
I do take issue when people say, Ah, that's, you know, as people are probably going to say in the

52:18.160 --> 52:22.880
comments of this video when we posted on YouTube, capitalism did this, we need to uproot capitalism.

52:22.880 --> 52:29.760
Yes. And we also need to, we need to actually solve the problem that we actually face in the

52:29.760 --> 52:36.160
limited amount of time that we have. And it is not an either or a problem. It is an and, and,

52:36.160 --> 52:41.520
and, and problem. So thank you so much for that. Yeah, I agree. And I think, I mean, I think the,

52:41.520 --> 52:46.320
I think the argument is often, well, we're just going to take the current system,

52:47.040 --> 52:51.200
energy system, for example, that we're in, and we're just solving it for a different one. And,

52:51.200 --> 52:55.440
and it's just going to be just as bad, and it's going to be so as extractive as it was before.

52:55.520 --> 52:59.280
And again, I think this comes a little bit back to these kinds of perfect solutions,

53:00.080 --> 53:04.640
this hunt for perfect solutions. I mean, I think we need to be real realistic that, you know,

53:05.520 --> 53:10.640
this is not about maintaining the status quo, but like this, the rebuilding our energy system is,

53:10.640 --> 53:15.280
you know, the biggest, ultimately, one of the biggest challenges we're going to face. And we're

53:15.280 --> 53:20.480
just going to see really dramatic changes here. So I don't think we should underestimate how,

53:20.480 --> 53:24.400
you know, big this transformation is that we're asking even in the food system, right? We're

53:24.400 --> 53:29.840
trying to completely transform our food system, completely transform our energy system or industry,

53:29.840 --> 53:35.840
you know, transport systems. So these are really kind of revolutionary changes. I think we should

53:35.840 --> 53:40.160
underplay that. But on the kind of extractive component, I think, you know, we're trying to move

53:40.160 --> 53:45.520
away from a fossil fuel system, which is just take, take, take, right? When you extract fossil

53:45.520 --> 53:50.400
fuels, you burn them, they're done, right? You need to extract more, you do this every, every year.

53:50.400 --> 53:55.920
And there we're talking about, you know, extracting 15 billion tons of fossil fuels every year.

53:56.480 --> 54:01.120
Now, we move to low carbon energy, for example, we will also need to extract minerals. That's

54:01.120 --> 54:05.600
completely true. And we need to be conscious of the environmental impact of that. But what's key

54:05.600 --> 54:10.400
is that we are talking about, you know, orders of magnitude, less minerals, you know, talking about

54:11.120 --> 54:16.960
tens to hundreds of millions of tons compared to 15 billion tons of fossil fuels every single year.

54:16.960 --> 54:22.160
I think the key point of this transition as well is that you don't need to extract this year after

54:22.160 --> 54:26.960
year after year, right? You can start to then recycle those minerals, you know, at the end of

54:26.960 --> 54:32.560
a solar panel's life for a wind turbine and put that back into the system. So we will need a ramp

54:32.560 --> 54:36.720
up period initially, because we just need to build lots of new stuff. But we'll hopefully

54:36.720 --> 54:42.560
reach a position where a lot of that can be recycled. And we get to more of a, you know, circular

54:42.560 --> 54:47.760
economy approach that people discuss, rather than just an extractive take, take, take one.

54:48.480 --> 54:54.800
Yeah. And what I love about that is that you're depicting us as taking a step towards the world

54:54.800 --> 54:59.360
we want. If you're someone listening to or watching this podcast who says capitalism is

54:59.360 --> 55:04.480
extractive and I, that's something I hate about it, well, you're describing an energy system that

55:04.480 --> 55:10.880
is far less extractive, right, that is pulling less out of the earth, ultimately, especially if

55:10.880 --> 55:18.400
we're able to, as you say, reuse some of the minerals that we extract. And so that is addressing

55:18.400 --> 55:23.120
part of the problem that you are trying to address. We're not ripping out the whole thing and replacing

55:23.120 --> 55:29.600
it in a day, but we are taking a step towards the world that we want, which I think is really

55:29.600 --> 55:34.080
important. And we talk about many issues on this show, whether we're talking about the criminal

55:34.080 --> 55:38.320
justice system, right? Some folks are prison abolitionists, police abolitionists. I'm like,

55:38.400 --> 55:45.440
hey, I don't disagree with the world that you're envisioning. Let's take steps in the meantime

55:45.440 --> 55:52.560
to build forms of justice that are alternatives to policing, so we can show people how it works

55:52.560 --> 55:57.600
and reduce our reliance on a day-to-day basis, rather than just focusing on the far-off horizon.

55:57.600 --> 56:02.640
We also need to take steps towards that world today under the system that we live in. And that's

56:02.640 --> 56:10.000
what you're talking about doing, which is why I love it so much. Are you ever, though, like,

56:11.680 --> 56:20.880
is there ever a pessimist bone in your body about it? Is there a world that you see us

56:20.880 --> 56:25.120
possibly heading towards that you're trying to steer us away from? Because sometimes I do know

56:25.120 --> 56:31.280
that the optimist's point of view, especially for a climate activist, it can be a little bit of a

56:31.280 --> 56:35.440
strategic choice, right? We need to be optimistic in order to do these things, and therefore it

56:35.440 --> 56:42.240
makes sense to take a strategy of optimism and not be public about the fear that's in the back

56:42.240 --> 56:48.480
of your head of like, oh, what if we don't do these things, right? So are you still powered by fear

56:48.480 --> 56:53.760
to some degree, or are you really like confident, hey, all of these great things are going to happen

56:53.760 --> 57:00.000
if we all keep pulling? No, definitely. Like, the fear is still there. Like, I still lose a lot of

57:00.000 --> 57:08.320
sleep over climate change. I guess I just try to balance that fear, and in some sense, anxiety

57:08.320 --> 57:14.160
with also with the optimism that there is something we can do about it. Like, I'm very clear always on

57:14.160 --> 57:18.560
my messaging and also in the book that, you know, the changes I describe in the book are not

57:18.560 --> 57:24.560
inevitable in any way, right? I don't know if we will do it. I can't force us to do it, but they

57:24.560 --> 57:29.440
are possible. And I think there's a massive opportunity there. And I think what we need at

57:29.440 --> 57:36.880
the moment is a positive vision of the world we could live in as almost as a North Star. I think

57:36.880 --> 57:42.800
there's a lot of the environmental messaging is almost built around damage limitation. And it's,

57:42.800 --> 57:47.600
you know, you know, the world will inevitably be worse in the future. We just decide how bad it's

57:47.600 --> 57:53.200
going to be. And I think actually we need a bit more of a positive vision of, no, actually, the

57:53.200 --> 57:58.160
future can be better. It will not inevitably be better, but there is something better that we

57:58.240 --> 58:03.680
can work towards. How do we go from where we are now to where we would want to be? So that's what

58:03.680 --> 58:09.760
I try to do with my messaging is try to present, you know, a bit more of a positive vision of where

58:09.760 --> 58:14.720
we're trying to go to, but also make clear that, you know, none of this inevitable. And, you know,

58:14.720 --> 58:18.960
if we stay on our current path, you know, I'm very scared about what the future will look like,

58:18.960 --> 58:24.080
because we're not on a good one. But I just have some level of optimism that we can get our act

58:24.080 --> 58:29.360
together and bend that curve closer to, you know, the temperature changes that we want and are

58:29.360 --> 58:35.520
achievable. So give me a little bit of that positive version of the or vision of the future,

58:35.520 --> 58:42.560
right? Like paying us a little bit of a picture of, you know, here I am. Like I said, I, you know,

58:42.560 --> 58:47.760
30 years ago, I was watching those cartoons, right? Captain Planet and whatnot. Today,

58:47.760 --> 58:51.120
I'm in my 40s. I'm like, hey, we didn't do as much as I feel like we should have done.

58:52.080 --> 58:59.600
But, you know, what is the world that I could live in when I'm 80 if we do all the things that

58:59.600 --> 59:04.400
you say are possible? So if we, you know, get our act together and tackle this, you know, we won't,

59:05.040 --> 59:09.600
I don't think we'll limit, you know, warming to 1.5 degrees. I think, you know, that's,

59:09.600 --> 59:15.200
you know, a very laudable goal. But I think, you know, we have kind of left it too late to

59:15.200 --> 59:20.480
achieve that. But I think the key point there is, you know, 1.5 degrees is not a cliff, right?

59:20.480 --> 59:25.280
Like we are, we need to fight for temperature ranges above that because with each incremental

59:25.280 --> 59:30.480
rising temperature, we increase risks. So I think 2 degrees is still within our grasp if we really

59:30.480 --> 59:35.520
get our act together. So we could limit warming to below 2 degrees. We will see, you know, increased

59:35.520 --> 59:41.440
impacts there, you know, but there are things that we can do to limit a lot of those impacts.

59:41.440 --> 59:47.680
So we'll live in a world where hopefully the majority of the world have access to energy.

59:47.680 --> 59:52.480
They have higher standards of living than they do today. Energy is very cheap.

59:53.760 --> 59:57.840
We don't have these, you know, massive energy price shocks, you know, that we have in a fossil

59:57.840 --> 01:00:03.600
fuel system because, you know, Putin invades Ukraine, like we've seen in the last few years.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:10.560
So we have more stable and low energy prices. People who have access to the energy services

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:14.640
they need, you know, we have much more livable cities that aren't, you know, completely governed

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:20.720
by cars on the road. There are, you know, better communities where we can interact. You know, we

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:25.120
have cycle lanes, public transport, you know, people are walking, people can sit outdoors,

01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:31.200
they can dine outdoors. We have clean air to breathe so people aren't dying from air pollution.

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:36.400
You know, we don't kill, you know, more than 70 billion animals every year for food, but we still

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:42.320
have, you know, really tasty nutritious diets. We've got zero deforestation because we've brought

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:48.640
that to an end. And we have, you know, these amazing wild landscapes coming back and wild

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:55.280
animals coming back. That is a beautiful vision. And you feel very confident that we can get there.

01:00:55.280 --> 01:01:00.720
You at least feel optimistic that we can get there. Yeah, these goals are completely achievable.

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:06.240
Whether we do them is up to us. And I mean, us, you know, at a very large collective level,

01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:11.680
but they're there for us. And I think the key point and what I try to communicate in my messaging

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:17.840
is that this transition is not a sacrifice. I mean, often this environmental stuff is posed as

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:22.720
a sacrifice. It's, you know, oh, we'll just have to cut back or we'll just have to sacrifice this

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:28.640
in order to preserve the future. And that's fine. Actually, that messaging is fine if that's the

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:34.080
correct, you know, notation and the correct idea and correct message there. And maybe we should

01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:37.920
just sacrifice, but we actually don't need to sacrifice because the changes we're making are

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:43.680
opportunities. So we have opportunities in the short term and it also leads to good benefits

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:49.680
over the long term. And I think we need to reframe our messaging here away from, you know,

01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:56.560
sacrifice towards one of opportunity and abundance. Yeah, that it's the classic scarcity

01:01:56.560 --> 01:02:05.680
mentality versus abundance mentality that we do not have to have worse lives. We do not have to

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:10.640
live in a worse world in order to prevent these outcomes. Actually, everything will be better.

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:18.240
We will all have more, more healthy, more vibrant, more prosperous lives if we were to make this

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:24.640
transition. I also, I love the name of your book so much, not the end of the world because it is such

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:33.040
a deep philosophical thing that people think the world is ending. And like it's, it's not possible

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:39.120
for it to end, right? Like you are, unless you personally die, right, you are going to wake up

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:44.240
in a world that exists and it is going to be better or worse, you know, and you are going

01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:49.840
to have to live in it and you have some amount of control. We all have some amount of control over

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:54.880
what that world is based on our actions today. And no matter how bad things are, we have the

01:02:54.880 --> 01:03:01.040
opportunity to do something that is going to make the world that we're going to wake up in tomorrow

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:06.960
a little bit better, a little bit worse. And so when I think about it that way, it makes me realize

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:13.200
this mentality that like the world is ending is nothing but a cop-out. It's, it's, it's false and

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:20.400
all it does is absolve you fictionally of that, of that power. It takes power away from you to

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:25.760
say that about the world. Yeah, I think that's the high extreme again. If you, you know, tell yourself

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:29.920
that the world is doomed and it's too late to tackle these problems and it is the end of the

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:35.280
world, then yeah, your reaction to that is, well, if it's over, then, you know, why, why, why should

01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:39.680
I take action anyway? You know, it won't make a difference. Maybe we should just, you know,

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:43.600
enjoy the remaining of our lives that we have left because nothing we do now is going to change

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:48.720
things. And that, again, I think that's a cop-out because that's just not the reality. And that

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:53.600
type of approach and that, you know, messaging is not going to get us to where we need to be. I

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:58.960
think we need to reframe our discussions around this of, yes, these are very serious problems.

01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:03.760
For some people, these actually are existential problems. Like people will die. People are dying

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:08.320
from air pollution. People are dying from climate change and people will die from climate change.

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:15.120
So for some people, this is really an existential threat. But we have the capacity to reduce those

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:20.000
risks, to reduce those dangers and actually not just, you know, have this damage limitation

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:25.760
vision, but also a better vision of actually improving the world going forward rather than

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:32.320
just trying to stop some of the damage. Yeah. And I mean, once you start thinking about that way,

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:39.680
it makes you realize how big of an opportunity you have because it's sort of, you go from thinking,

01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:44.320
ah, what can I do to fight climate change or to fight these problems to thinking, oh,

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:51.760
everything that I do can be a solution. You know, like, whether it's eating vegan or it's,

01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:56.720
you know, getting the electric car or it's doing policy work or whatever, like every single thing

01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:03.280
that you do is a move in the right direction if you choose for it to be. And it can be massively

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:08.400
empowering to think about it that way. Yeah, exactly. And I think the, as I was saying earlier, I

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:12.800
think, I mean, these are, you know, massive transitions that we're doing and they touch

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:18.320
on basically every sector, which means that, you know, regardless of, you know, what you're working

01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:24.720
in or where you're working or what you're doing, you know, these issues are touching you and you

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:30.720
can have a positive impact on that. Like, I think we often think of what you can do in environmentalism

01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:37.360
as just, you know, how do I reduce my carbon footprint? And that's fine. And I give recommendation

01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:42.160
of how people can do that most effectively. But I think we should also be more ambitious about

01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:47.120
that. You know, my contribution is not just going to be how do I limit my footprint as much as

01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:52.000
possible. I actually want to offset that and more by the positive impacts that I make, whether it's,

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:57.920
you know, communicating to others, whether it's someone, you know, working in politics, working

01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:04.000
in engineering or finance or, you know, we all play a role in trying to shift all of these systems

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:09.280
into a more sustainable path. And actually, you know, regardless of what you do, you're probably

01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:17.760
hitting on those every day. Yes. And this is why I'm so against people putting themselves in a

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:21.360
position of powerlessness. And a lot of times when I'm arguing with what I think people are

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:25.120
going to write in the comments, it's me arguing with that. People say, oh, we can't do anything

01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:31.280
because capitalism. No, you can do a hell of a lot. And it's not only your responsibility,

01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:37.280
it's your opportunity to do so. And if you don't take it, you are, you're putting yourself in a

01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:42.720
position you're declaring that you have no power when the opposite is true. I so appreciate you

01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:47.760
coming on today to dispel some of my lingering pessimism and tell me why I'm wrong about it.

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:51.760
I absolutely loved it. The name of the book is not the end of the world. People can, of course,

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:58.160
get it at our special bookshop, factuallypod.com slash books. But where can people find you online,

01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:04.720
Hannah? And how can they get involved in this fight? Yeah, so I, maybe one of the best places is

01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:10.480
I work for a project called Our World in Data. And that's a website. And we have data and research

01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:14.800
on not just climate change and environment, but what we frame as the world's largest problems.

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:19.360
So you can go on there and look at all the data to try to understand what's going on in the world.

01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:23.360
It's an incredible resource. It's really an amazing site. People should go check it out,

01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:30.320
Our World in Data. Yeah, I have a substack called Sustainability by Numbers, where I try to understand

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:35.600
these problems on environment and climate through numbers. So not about like gut feelings or, you

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:41.040
know, intuitions or anecdotes. We're actually looking at the data on electric vehicles, for example.

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:48.320
I was really going based on gut feelings and anecdotes. And so you bringing numbers was an

01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:52.640
important corrective to that. I love that. Sustainability in Numbers. Yeah. And I think how

01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:57.600
people can contribute this like in so many ways. I think there is the, you know, reducing your

01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:03.200
personal carbon footprint bit, which is important. But I think much more wider than that. I think a key

01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:07.600
one is just, you know, how do you contribute, you know, from your career, for example, a lot of people,

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:11.920
especially younger people are deciding, you know, what should I do with my life? If you're

01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:16.960
interested in this area, there are so many areas that you can get involved and make a positive

01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:22.000
difference, whether that's in engineering, whether that's becoming an electricity into, you know,

01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:27.120
massively enhance the grid or install heat pumps, whether it's spreading the message

01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:31.360
through art. I mean, there's so many ways that you can do this in a much more positive way.

01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:37.200
And then obviously also really key to that is trying to influence politics. And as we discussed

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:42.160
markets, I think you also have an impact on the market by the stuff that you buy. When you're

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:46.080
buying an EV, you're signaling, you know, we're done with petrol and diesel cars.

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:51.600
The world is moving towards electric cars. I think we can also have an impact politically and

01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:56.320
on our market systems. Thank you so much for coming on, Hannah. I can't thank you enough.

01:08:56.320 --> 01:09:00.640
