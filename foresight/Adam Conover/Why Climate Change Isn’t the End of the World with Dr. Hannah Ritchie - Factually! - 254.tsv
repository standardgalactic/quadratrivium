0	4000	Hello and welcome to Factually. I'm Adam Conover. Thank you so much for joining me on the show
4000	10320	again. You know, the climate situation is very bad. In order to stop a laundry list of dire
10320	15360	consequences, we need to keep the rise in temperature to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius
15360	21440	higher than pre-industrial times. And currently, we're on track for warming by almost 2.7 degrees
21440	28160	by 2100. Like I said, that is bad. And given this situation, given the stunning inaction we
28160	33600	have seen for decades, you could be forgiven for writing it all off and finding a nice hole to
33600	38320	bury yourself in as things get worse until you die. There's an attitude a lot of people have
38320	43440	right now that basically says the world is ending and there's nothing we can do about it. So let's
43440	50320	all give up. But guess what? That is not true. The world is not ending. It is going to exist
50320	55520	tomorrow, whether it's better or worse, and you are going to have to live in it. And personally,
55520	61920	I'm too much of a fan of my life and of planet Earth itself to give up. I don't think it's an
61920	66880	environmental position to say, oh, we're fucked. There's nothing we can do because there is always
66880	72720	something we can do. The problem is figuring out what that is. And to answer that question,
72720	79440	we need to understand clearly where we are, how we got here, and just what is actually possible.
79440	84400	It's not about optimism and it's not about pessimism. It's about understanding the reality
84400	88480	of the world we live in and what we can actually do about it. And you know what?
88480	94160	The best cure for despair is to grab a shovel and pitch the fuck in. And our guest today
94160	98800	is going to help us do that. She is deep in the weeds on all of the data and she has written
98800	104640	a deeply data-informed book that we can use as a baseline to help us attack the challenges we face
104640	108560	in creating a sustainable future. But before we get into it, I just want to remind you

141920	146720	global development at Oxford. And she's the author of the new book, Not the End of the World,
146720	150000	How We Can Be the First Generation to Build a Sustainable Planet.
150000	153280	I know you're going to love this conversation. Please welcome Dr. Hannah Richie.
156240	158080	Hannah, thank you so much for being on the show.
158080	160720	No, thanks very much for having me. Looking forward to the conversation.
160720	164880	Yeah. So you have a new book out called Not the End of the World. We're at a time where
165600	169600	so many people talk about the world that we live in as though it's about to end.
169600	173680	Oh, who knows if there'll even be another presidential election? Oh, who knows if
173680	177840	a retirement? Oh, the world's not even going to be around that long. We have this fatalism
177840	182400	about almost everything, which is, I think, a very odd viewpoint to have.
183200	186720	It's a very interesting thing about our time that so many people feel that way.
187360	191840	But it really seems to stem, first of all, from the climate crisis that we've, you know,
191840	198160	I was brought up knowing, you know, watching kids' cartoons about how climate change is
198160	202080	coming and we're ruining the planet and we have to do something. And then for the last,
202080	205360	you know, 30 plus years of my life, I've watched very little be done.
205360	208880	And so I understand why people would say, OK, well, that means we're screwed because I was
208880	214240	told about this crisis as a kid and we're still not doing as much as we should be. And therefore,
214240	217600	you know, we're going to be a member of the last generation, you hear people say.
218480	224480	You have a new book out called Not the End of the World, which takes the opposite viewpoint
224480	229600	in its title. I love that. Tell me about it. Why do you have that view, that it's not the end of
229600	234240	the world? Yeah, I mean, the title is called Not the End of the World. And I think it matters how
234240	238880	you say it. I mean, the book tackles seven big environmental problems, like I think climate
238880	244000	change is the big one that we think of, but we face a range of other big environmental problems
244000	248320	as well. And I think the title is not, you know, oh, it's not the end of the world. This is not a
248320	253600	big deal. No, it's a definitive, these are massive problems, but we're going to make sure that this
253600	258400	is not the end of the world because there are solvable problems. I mean, if we, even if we just
258400	262960	focus on the issue of climate change, I think, you know, coming from an environmental background,
262960	267520	working in this area for years, and, you know, also speaking to other climate scientists in this
267520	274640	area feels like we've done a very fast 180 from, you know, not that long ago, you know, the discussion
274640	279360	around this was, you know, is it actually happening? Are humans actually causing it? We seem to have
279360	285840	done like a 180 towards, oh, it's too late and now there's nothing we can do. And I think, you know,
285840	289520	I think we're kind of suffering from this kind of whiplash of, you know, what happened in the last
289520	295280	five to 10 years that we've done a complete 180 from almost semi-denial to it's too late and there's
295280	300080	nothing we can do. So, you know, what I try to do in the book is lay out, yes, these are, you know,
300080	305200	massive and urgent problems. And if we don't get our act together, the consequences will be really,
305200	310640	really catastrophic. But there is someone we can do about it. And although we aren't making progress
310640	314800	as fast as we would want, and we're not on track for where we need to be, we are actually making
314800	319040	progress. And we can massively accelerate that if we make the right decisions now.
320400	326000	Do you think the view that it's too late, there's nothing we can do about it, is that, you know,
326000	330800	another form of climate denialism? You say we've made a 180 from, oh, we're not doing it at all to
331760	336480	it's too late. Is that just the new form of climate change denialism?
336480	341200	I mean, I think, I mean, I think maybe some people try to push that message because they
341200	345600	they think that it's helpful for the kind of climate denial message. I mean, I think for some
345600	350800	people that's not their motivation. I think they generally just feel, you know, paralyzed and helpless
350800	356160	in the massive problem. So I don't think it comes from the same place. I think the actions or the
356160	361920	outcomes are very similar, right? Both extremes of it's not a problem or it's too late to do
361920	367120	anything about it. Both lead to the outcome of inaction, right? They both lead us to, you know,
367120	370880	what on one side you don't take action because there's not a problem to deal with in the first
370880	375120	place. At the other extreme, you don't take action because it's pointless. And if we're screwed,
375120	379280	then what's the point of doing anything anyway? So I think the outcomes of these two extremes
379280	382240	can be the same even if the intent behind them is not.
383040	389280	Yeah. So you say we are making progress. What are examples of that? Let's try to front load the
389280	395760	podcast episode with some good news. How about that? What is a reason for an optimistic viewpoint?
395760	400560	So I think if you look at the trajectory we're currently on on climate change, it's not where
400560	404960	we need to be. Like we're on track for between two and a half to three degrees of warming. Now,
404960	411360	that's way above our 1.5 degrees or two degrees target. But if you are looking at where we were
411360	415760	talking about where we were headed a decade ago, you know, it was three and a half to four degrees.
415760	421120	So that's like a degree lower than trajectory we thought we were on a decade ago. Now, it's where
421120	426240	we are is not acceptable. But if we can make that progress in a decade, why can we not make more
426240	431840	progress to pull two and a half degrees down to two degrees? So I think there is a bit of a good
431840	436880	news story there. I mean, I think the most dramatic and positive change for me has been that if you
436880	442480	look a decade ago, I was really pessimistic about where we were, because if you looked at any of the
442480	447280	solutions we need to tackle climate change, I mean, fundamentally is we need to move away from
447280	453840	fossil fuels to low carbon energy. The problem a decade ago is that the forms of low carbon
453840	459680	energy we had were way more expensive than fossil fuels. So no one was going to deploy this at scale
459680	465600	because it was way, way too expensive. Over the last 10 years or so, you know, the price of solar
465600	470720	has fallen by 90 percent, the price of wind has fallen by 70 percent, the price of batteries and
470720	476720	electric vehicles has fallen by about 90 percent, which means that the low carbon energy sources
476720	482080	we need are now cheaper than fossil fuels. So you don't no longer have this, you know, this tradeoff
482080	487760	of, you know, should we sacrifice the economy to tackle climate change? Because they're now aligned.
487760	493600	It's actually just in our short term economic interest as well to go for the low carbon option.
493600	498000	And I think for me, that's been the most dramatic change and the most dramatic progress we've made.
498000	501920	Now it's really about building the stuff, right? We've pulled the prices down.
501920	504800	Now it's about building this stuff out as quickly as we can.
505760	509120	What I think is interesting about the answer, and you hear that a lot from,
510240	514320	you know, folks who are really following what's happening with the climate, that the price of
514320	520400	renewable or non-fossil fuel energy has gone down so much, that's hugely good news.
520400	525200	What I think is interesting about that is it really is relying on, you know, the market,
525200	528880	on capitalism, right? The price is low and therefore the good thing is going to happen.
529760	535200	I guess what I'm curious about is what is our ability to do things that the market does not
535200	538880	demand? You know, for instance, if I look at transportation here in the U.S., let me just
538880	543760	give you a pessimistic case or a pessimistic example. You know, a huge amount of our emissions
543760	548400	come from transportation. And a huge of that is because of, you know, single occupancy,
548400	554240	passenger cars, people driving two and four in these giant pieces of metal. And, you know,
554240	558480	if we had, for instance, you know, massively expanded public transportation in the United
558480	566480	States, high-speed rail, passenger rail, you know, subways, etc., even just increased buses,
566480	570720	we could massively reduce emissions. But instead, we're putting all of our change
570720	575520	into electric vehicles, which are a marginal improvement. We're changing the engine of the car,
575520	581040	right? And we're pushing the emissions to the power plant. But that'll be an improvement.
581040	589200	However, even that has stalled in the last year because, A, the government has not built a massive
589200	594640	series of electric vehicle chargers everywhere. But B, you know, the car industry is kind of like,
594640	599680	ah, sure looks like consumers love the giant gas guzzling SUVs. That's what they prefer to buy.
599680	604080	And who are we to tell them to buy something different? People want to buy giant, people
604080	608320	don't even want small electric cars. When they're buying electric cars, they're buying fucking huge
608320	613760	ones that, like, take massively more energy to move around, massively more energy to build, etc.
613760	620240	And so, you know, reducing the price and hoping, all right, if we just make the slip go in the
620240	623600	right direction, all the water will run the right way and we'll be moving in the right direction.
624720	629120	That's great. But it also seems there, we have to have an ability to do things that are,
629120	633760	that are counter to what is cheap and available, right? And do we have the ability to do that?
633760	638160	I know that's a big question to land on you early in the podcast, but it's,
638160	642800	it's what you made me think of. No, it's, and I largely agree with you. I think there's a couple
642800	648080	of points there. I think I disagree that an electric car is just like a marginal improvement on a
648080	654080	petrol or diesel one. I mean, even a big electric car, if you look at, I mean, what's, what, there's
654080	658800	always a debate of, is an electric car actually better on carbon than a petrol or diesel? I
658800	663600	think what's true there is that the manufacturing of the car emits more carbon, right? Because it
663600	668720	takes more energy to build the battery than you would have on a petrol or diesel car. But once
668720	674240	you start driving it, the, you, you pay off the carbon debt very quickly. So in the UK, for example,
674240	680000	it pays off within two years for the average driver. And then from then on, the carbon emissions of the
680000	686000	car are much lower. So you're talking about like a too far, up to too far reduction. And as, and
686000	690640	that's great, but I do just want to toss in that almost everyone I know in the United States buys
690640	695600	a new car every three years. So if you're paying it back in two years, or at least they're on a
695600	699280	lease where they renew it every three years, so there, there's that still, still that consumer
699280	705920	behavior problem. But please keep going. I think on that, but I think the, I'm free years seems
705920	711040	very, very short. I mean, I think most people in the UK, at least by secondhand cars, I mean,
711040	716480	the key point is that if they're buying a new car, their car they're selling will go to someone else
716480	720480	that will be might be replacing a petrol or diesel car. So I think at the system level, it'll be
721120	725680	better. If you look at the emissions of an electric car, you know, you're talking about
725680	731040	around a too farge reduction in emissions. And actually that will get better over time, right?
731040	736640	Countries are decarbonizing the electricity grid so that, you know, by hopefully by 2035, for
736640	741680	example, actually the running emissions of your electric car might be zero because the US has
741680	747200	decarbonized its electricity grid. But I take your point that I think, you know, just leaving this
747200	751760	for the markets to run, you know, won't get us there. I think what's also really key is the
751760	756880	time scale on which this is needed. I think, I think the economics of the energy transition
757600	764080	are now just so good that, you know, we would just do this anyway, but we might do this over 60 or
764080	769280	70 years and we don't have 60 or 70 years. We need to do this in a much faster timeframe,
769360	774480	which means you do need to combine, you know, take the advantages of the free market economics,
774480	780000	but also impose policy on top of that. I mean, even if you're looking at the really dramatic
780000	785760	declines in the prices of solar, for example, over the last 10 or 15 years, they were initially
785760	792000	pushed by policy, right? Some countries very early on, you know, set up R&D, set up, you know,
792720	797920	it schemes to do this at a very high cost. And that has been like the first, you know, push
797920	804080	that we needed in order to get these emissions out. So I think you do need this combination of
804080	809840	policy to put, you know, accelerate these timescales. And you can also take advantage of
809840	817440	the free market economics of it as well. I really appreciate you pushing back my rant about cars
817440	823120	with the data that you have. And that was what I was hoping you would do, because, you know,
823120	829440	I think you sort of, I found a little bit of my own built-in pessimism and I loved the way that
829440	835680	you spoke to it. Do you often get a lot of pushback when you are spreading these messages?
835680	839600	Is there a way in which, you know, the people that you're talking to, myself included,
839600	843520	sometimes seem like we almost want to be pessimistic about this topic? Like we have a,
843520	848880	maybe a built-in cynicism about it? A little bit. I think what I sometimes find is that
850320	857200	for every solution we come up with, there's a, yes, but there's always a counter of like,
857200	860880	why that solution won't work or why that solution is not good. And I think that's very healthy.
860880	864960	Like I think if we want to find good solutions, we need to be highly critical of them.
864960	869280	Right. We need to work out what is the good solution, what's effective, what's not effective.
869280	874240	So we're putting our priorities and money and investment in the right places. So I think we
874240	879600	really need this kind of critical lens to these solutions. I think what, I think for me of what's
879600	885440	really critical in this energy transition and tackling climate change is that I think we're
885440	891680	always hunting for the absolute perfect solution. We're looking for the solution that has no land
891680	897760	juice, no minerals, and that's zero carbon. You know, there's zero negative impacts whatsoever.
897760	904480	And I think the reality is that those solutions just don't exist. What we're looking for,
904480	908240	and we need to do this quickly, we need to move away from fossil fuels quickly. So what we're
908240	914080	looking for are solutions that are orders of magnitude better than fossil fuels. And we're
914080	918480	having them, we have them, and we're developing them. And we need to work on the downsides of
918480	923520	those and make sure we're not creating more damage by the solutions that we're bringing in.
923520	928480	I think if we are to wait for the absolute perfect solution to come along, we'll just maintain our
928480	932080	the state's quo, right? We'll just keep burning fossil fuels, and we won't be willing to move
932080	936640	to anything else. I think we need to get a bit of the balance there where we acknowledge the
936640	943040	downsides to some of these other technologies or other alternatives, but we try to make the most
943040	947200	of them and we go for this transition anyway. I think that's a really good point. And it's
947200	952480	something I think about a lot is when we are trying to change the world for the better,
952480	958560	not letting the perfect be the enemy of the good, but while at the same time, maintaining a little
958560	965040	bit of skepticism and criticality, because there are also folks who will sell a solution as being
965040	968800	better than it is when we could be asking for a little bit more. And that's why, look, I'm a
968800	974000	transportation wonk, I care about that a lot. And in my view, if we're rethinking, especially the US's
974000	979280	transportation system, if we only change the engines that are in the vehicles, that's a missed
979280	984000	opportunity because there's a much bigger win to be had. There's a better society to be built,
984000	987600	and we shouldn't expect, we shouldn't accept, hey, there's a lot of people who want to sell us
987600	994080	a bunch of fancy new cars. And if we do more, we will have an even better outcome. But at the same
994080	998480	time, I'm not one of those people who's like, ah, it costs a lot of carbon to build the battery,
998480	1004160	so fuck it. I don't think there's a medium to be found there. I don't think everyone should go out
1004160	1008160	and buy a brand new electric car every three years. I think that's excessive. But I do think, hey,
1008160	1012320	if you can get a used electric car and you've driven your previous car into the ground and it's
1012320	1022000	time to go ahead, et cetera, there is that medium. I'm very curious, though, you talk about how we
1022000	1026480	need to find new forms of energy that are many orders of magnitude better than fossil fuels.
1027040	1032400	There are some who would say, well, what if instead of finding a great new form of energy,
1032400	1037680	what if we cut back? What if we just didn't waste so much? What if we didn't use so much? What if we
1037760	1044080	didn't insist on so much growth, et cetera? This is sort of the degrowth movement. There's a lot
1044080	1051360	of folks who have that sort of perspective, what if rather than more, we had less? And I'm curious
1051920	1057280	what you think about that point of view. I mean, I think there is some room for that. I think
1057280	1061760	where I'm skeptical is, I mean, trying to convince people to do that is very, very difficult.
1061840	1068800	And I think we would struggle with that type of message. I mean, to come back to the policy
1068800	1073760	point earlier, of course, there are things that you could do to put a cap on what we would consider
1073760	1083280	a very excessive consumption. If massive SUVs are a problem, tax really big SUVs. If really
1083280	1090400	frequent flying is a challenge, then set a tax on really frequent flying. I think you need to
1090400	1094960	be quite careful with those policies that you don't get lots of pushback. You might get pushback
1094960	1099760	if you were to put high tax on the first flight that someone takes in a given year.
1099760	1103920	But you might be able to do it at much higher levels of consumption. Someone's fifth flight
1103920	1111440	of the year, you start to put high tax on. I'm a stand-up comedian. I fly, I take maybe 40 flights
1111440	1118640	a year. That was that last year. I easily am on the highest level of frequent flyer loyalty bonuses
1119200	1123840	because it's what I do for a living. And you know what? I think I would be okay being taxed
1123840	1130320	on that because I'm doing it to make money. That's how I make a living. And if I'm using the system
1130320	1135840	that much, I would be happy if I knew that some amount of money that I was spending was going
1135840	1141840	towards ameliorating the climate harms of the flying. But you're right. I cannot just say,
1141840	1146080	hey, what if I cut back in flying a little bit? Because it's literally how I make a living.
1146880	1150000	And I think a lot of folks are in the same situation. It's very difficult to ask people,
1150000	1153600	hey, what if you just cut back? What if we all just cut back and have smaller lives
1153600	1158240	where we're less prosperous, having less fun, enjoying life less? That's just sort of not a
1158240	1164720	great pitch to people for how to solve a problem. Yeah, I don't think it's a great pitch. And I
1164720	1168640	think if that's going to be your message, I don't think we'll get very far, very quickly.
1169280	1174320	I mean, I'm not against the reductions in what we make called excess consumption. I think there
1174320	1180240	are potential ways to do that. I think what would be difficult is how do we agree on what a
1180240	1185360	level of what excessive is, right? What excessive is to you is not the same as what excessive is
1186080	1192880	to me. I think there is another key part of this, which is that if we want to reduce energy
1192880	1198960	consumption, a really good way to do that is just to decarbonise. I think we can talk about
1199680	1204800	behaviour change and that's fine. But I think we're also underestimating how much we can reduce
1204800	1210720	energy use just by getting rid of fossil fuels and by electrifying our energy systems. So if you
1210720	1216640	look at, you know, if you blow up like a diagram of the US energy system today from like the fossil
1216640	1222320	fuels that are burned and where that actually goes towards providing people what we call energy
1222320	1228160	services. So that's like heating your home or lighting your home or, you know, the wheels turning
1228160	1233840	in your car. The majority of that energy is wasted along the way. And that's because when you burn
1233840	1239120	fossil fuels, most of it goes to waste heat. It doesn't actually go towards, you know, actually
1239120	1244640	giving you the power that you need. Right. Which means that if you were to take fossil fuels out
1244640	1251120	of the system, you would get rid of a lot of the energy use without taking anything away from the
1251120	1256320	energy services or the final consumption. So your behaviours could stay exactly the same
1256320	1261440	if you wanted to, but you would need much, much less energy in the system. And that just comes
1261440	1266080	from getting rid of fossil fuels and then electrifying stuff like transport, for example.
1266080	1272800	So if you take your gasoline car, for every dollar of gasoline you put in it,
1272800	1277840	only 20 cents actually goes towards turning the wheels and moving you. The other 80 cents is just
1277840	1284560	wasted. Whereas an electric car is almost the opposite. So every dollar of electricity you put
1285040	1290720	in, only 20 cents is wasted. And around 80 cents goes towards turning the wheels. So actually to
1290720	1296240	drive the same distance in an electric car of the same size, you might need three to four times less
1296240	1301920	energy. So your behaviour hasn't changed, but you've actually massively reduced your energy
1301920	1306560	consumption. So I think we also underestimate our ability to reduce energy use just by doing the
1306560	1312000	decarbonisation bit. And then you can talk about individual behaviour change as a way to also supplement
1312880	1317200	Okay, you're really smacking down my argument again about electric cars being a marginal
1317200	1321760	improvement. It's still marginal, but it's a very large margin. I absolutely grant you that.
1322480	1327280	And I agree. It's really important to look at where the actual waste is. If we're talking about
1327280	1332800	flying, rather than me flying around to make a living, we could look at, for instance, private
1332800	1339440	jets or that kind of thing. We could look at where the largest waste is. Maybe certain celebrities
1339440	1343200	don't need to take a 15 minute flight from one airport to another. They could take a goddamn cap,
1343200	1348720	you know, etc. You know, I got to confess, I have always been a sucker for Japanese treats. I love
1348720	1353520	going down a little Tokyo, heading to a convenience store and grabbing all those brightly coloured,
1353520	1358000	fun packaged boxes off of the shelf. But you know what? I don't get the chance to go down there
1358000	1362480	as often as I would like to. And that is why I am so thrilled that Bokksu, a Japanese snack
1362480	1367280	subscription box, chose to sponsor this episode. What's got me so excited about Bokksu is that
1367280	1371840	these aren't just your run-of-the-mill grocery store finds. Each box comes packed with 20 unique
1371840	1377120	snacks that you can only find in Japan itself. Plus, they throw in a handy guide filled with
1377120	1381200	info about each snack and about Japanese culture. And let me tell you something. You are going to
1381200	1385360	need that guide because this box comes with a lot of snacks. I just got this one today,
1385360	1391360	direct from Bokksu, and look at all of these things. We got some sort of seaweed snack here.
1391360	1397760	We've got a buttercream cookie. We've got a dolce. I'm going to have to read the guide to
1397760	1402000	figure out what this one is. It looks like some sort of sponge cake. Oh my gosh. This one is,
1402000	1409200	I think it's some kind of maybe fried banana chip. Let's try it out and see. Is that what it is?
1411600	1417600	Nope. It's not banana. Maybe it's a cassava potato chip. I should have read the guide. Ah,
1417600	1422880	here they are. Iburigako smoky chips. Potato chips made with rice flour, providing a lighter
1422880	1427680	texture and satisfying crunch. Oh my gosh. This is so much fun. You got to get one of these for
1427680	1432400	themselves and get this for the month of March. Bokksu has a limited edition cherry blossom box
1432400	1437040	and 12 month subscribers get a free kimono style robe and get this while you're wearing your new
1437040	1441600	duds learning fascinating things about your tasty snacks. You can also rest assured that you have
1441600	1447200	helped to support small family run businesses in Japan because Bokksu works with 200 plus
1447200	1451760	small makers to get their snacks delivered straight to your door. So if all of that sounds good,
1451760	1456160	if you want a big box of delicious snacks like this for yourself, use the code factually for
1456160	1463040	$15 off your first order at Bokksu.com. That's code factually for $15 off your first order on Bokksu.com.
1463840	1468880	Okay. I want to talk about some of the other crises that you mentioned. I just want to ask
1468880	1474560	you one more question on this first about the price going down because there's also a phenomenon
1474560	1479200	when things get more efficient and the price goes down, we do tend to use more of them. I think about
1480720	1486720	LED lights, which are massively more efficient than every other form of light ever made,
1487520	1491680	but the result is that people are using, and businesses especially are using a lot more
1491680	1496240	LED lights because, hey, guess what? We can now have 10 times the lights for the same cost or
1496240	1504800	whatever. So why not leave them running all the time because they're just LEDs? Is that at all an
1504800	1510960	issue in, hey, the price of moving, the price of heating your home goes down, the price of lighting
1510960	1515360	goes down, the price of all these things go down? Does that just mean we'll use more of them, not less?
1516240	1523120	I think there's two angles to this. I think one angle is looking at a large part of the world
1523200	1528320	where a big constraint is just they cannot afford energy. People that don't have much heating or
1528320	1534160	lighting or air con, and actually just a big everyday struggle for them is, how do I get
1534160	1540320	access to energy? And for those people, a reduction in energy prices is a massive benefit. They might
1540320	1545760	get energy for the first time. They might get vital energy services that we have enjoyed for a long
1545760	1551520	time. So I think for them, low energy prices is just a benefit. And actually, we should be supportive
1551520	1554480	of the fact that their energy use might increase because it will mask the increase.
1554480	1557120	That is a great point. That's a great point. Thank you.
1557680	1562080	And then I think when we're talking about, for example, people in the US or the UK,
1562080	1567600	like richer countries, I think this effect that you describe is what we call the Jevons paradox,
1568640	1573840	whereas the price of something falls or as efficiency improves, you use more of it.
1574480	1580160	Now, there are a range of studies trying to look at how big this, we call it the rebound effect,
1580160	1586960	how big the rebound is. And most tend to find that there is some rebound, right? So you do
1586960	1593440	undo some of the improvements that you get in efficiency, for example, but they rarely rebound
1593440	1600160	more than 100%, right? So they might rebound 50%. So rather than getting the full 100% of the
1600160	1605760	efficiency gains, because you use more, you might only get 50%. So it's not as good as you might
1605760	1611680	initially expect just from the numbers, but it's often not so much that you use more energy
1611680	1618800	than you did before. So LEDs is a good example where people after getting LEDs, you did just use
1618800	1623680	more lights or you left them on or you might have installed more in your home. But actually,
1623680	1628800	energy use for lighting in the US has still gone down so that the rebound wasn't 100%,
1628800	1631760	but we did undo some of those gains because we use more.
1632400	1636880	Yeah. Well, and I was thinking about reading studies about light pollution that like light
1636880	1642160	pollution has, if you're an astronomer or someone who cares about bats,
1643120	1647280	like you might not be happy about LEDs because we're using more, but I'm glad to hear that the
1648000	1652320	energy use has gone down. I love knowing the name of that, the Jervins paradox. I hadn't heard
1652320	1660720	that before. Oh, Jevins. Yeah, Jevins paradox. That's really cool. This is great. I love that I
1660720	1665360	keep standing up these arguments for you and you keep knocking them down so ably. You're my
1665360	1671120	favorite kind of guest. You say that climate change is only one of many types of environmental
1671760	1674080	problem that we have facing us. What are some of the others?
1674080	1680800	I mean, I think another big one is air pollution where globally estimates, there are a range of
1680800	1685600	estimates of how many people die prematurely from air pollution every year, but they're all in the
1685600	1692000	millions. And the World Health Organization, for example, estimates that around 7 million premature
1692000	1698000	deaths every year from air pollution, which is a massive deal. And there's two problems of air
1698000	1704560	pollution there. One is what we call indoor air pollution. And that's people typically on much
1704560	1709840	lower incomes, where actually the only sources of energy they have are like wood or charcoal.
1710400	1716000	And they burn leaves in their home for heating or cooking fuels, and then they inhale the smoke.
1716000	1719920	And that's really, really bad for human health. So they have millions of deaths from that.
1720480	1725360	And then we have millions of deaths from outdoor air pollution. So that's stuff from our cars,
1725360	1730880	power plants, for example, industry. And again, millions of people die there prematurely every
1730880	1737360	year from that source of pollution. So for me, you were to quantify deaths from environmental
1737440	1742560	problems today, like air pollution would be very much top of the list. And it's something we
1742560	1747440	can have in the back of our mind, but don't really think about. Yeah. I mean, it's completely insane
1747440	1752080	that when we look at the toll of our energy system, it's one that we don't often keep in mind,
1752080	1758320	because it's sort of like an invisible death toll. Again, transportation causing emissions,
1758320	1762320	even if you just look at deaths from our transportation system, we think of car crashes,
1762960	1767120	people being hit by buses or whatever. We don't think about the number of people who
1767120	1772800	are dying of respiratory illnesses that they got because they live 800 feet from a freeway,
1772800	1776800	as many people do here in Los Angeles where I live. I mean, there's like some federal regulation
1776800	1780400	that says you're not supposed to build a home within X number of feet of a freeway.
1780400	1784640	And in Los Angeles, something like, I don't know, a huge percentage, like 40% of homes
1784640	1789600	are in violation of this because we have freeways everywhere. There's just so much air pollution.
1789600	1793440	And so people are dying left and right of respiratory diseases, but that doesn't hit the
1793440	1800880	news. It doesn't say, hey, a five-year-old child with asthma killed or a person dies at 65 when
1800880	1806480	they would have died at 90 because of air pollution in the same way that a car crash does.
1806480	1814000	And yet, those deaths are caused by the same thing. Yeah, exactly. And I mean, this is another
1814000	1820000	what we call an externality of burning fossil fuels. And that works in the same way as climate.
1820000	1826160	The CO2 emissions and the damages from climate change are like an externality, a kind of cost to
1826160	1831200	society, a social cost and environmental cost that isn't factored into the price of fossil fuels
1831200	1835120	when you burn them. And it's the same for air pollution. That's exactly the same thing. This
1835120	1841920	is a kind of hidden externality that we just don't really think about. I mean, again, I like to
1841920	1846960	highlight that these problems are solvable problems. They're tractable problems. I mean,
1846960	1853120	if you were to look across a range of especially high-income countries, we have actually made
1853120	1858400	progress on reducing air pollution over the last few decades. The US Clean Air Act has been really
1858400	1863920	successful in reducing emissions of these gases. The same in the UK. We've seen a really rapid
1863920	1870560	decline. There's still an unacceptable number of people dying from this, but we can make progress
1870560	1875840	when we put the right policies in place and we make these transitions. I guess the key challenge
1875840	1880240	there is that most people dying from air pollution today live kind of in middle-income
1880240	1885280	countries that have industrialized very, very quickly, but they've done that by burning fuels,
1885280	1892080	especially very close to city centers. So Delhi, for example, Beijing was one where if you were to
1892080	1898400	go to Beijing a decade or so ago, really, really heavily polluted. Over the last decade, it's made
1898400	1904080	amazing progress in reducing air pollution and added years onto the lives of its citizens.
1904080	1909120	So I like to highlight that these are massive problems, but they are also tractable ones and
1909120	1914000	they are ones that we can make progress on. And what are some of the other environmental
1914000	1917520	challenges? I love hearing this. I love hearing a problem and then a solution right after it.
1919600	1924640	I mean, I think a big one is our food systems. I think people massively underestimate the
1924640	1929360	environmental impacts of our food systems. I mean, I think there's almost no environmental problem
1929360	1934800	where food isn't either a big player or completely dominates the impacts. I mean,
1934800	1940080	it contributes around between a quarter and a third of greenhouse gas emissions for climate change.
1941120	1945680	It's the leading driver of deforestation. It's the leading driver of biodiversity loss.
1945680	1950400	It's the biggest user of fresh water. I mean, I think when we think about fresh water,
1950400	1956240	we think about taking a shower or brushing our teeth. It's farming is the biggest user of water.
1956800	1961120	It's the leading driver of water pollution. So there's a really long list of environmental
1961120	1966240	problems where food and what we eat and how we produce it really sits at the center of that.
1966240	1973920	Yeah. And so how do we solve this? Because some people are watching this or listening to this
1973920	1980320	going, vegan, we should all be vegan. And what a wonderful world that would be. And I've eaten
1980320	1987040	vegan for long periods for many times in my life. And yet I do not believe that we are going to solve
1987040	1994880	this problem by convincing every single person to go vegan one by one in the way that a religious
1994880	1999760	proselytizer might, that folks who are doing that are doing the Lord's work good on you. But I don't
1999760	2005520	think we're going to solve the problem that way. And I also think that eating organic,
2005520	2011040	eating local, small scale farms, very nice for folks who can afford it. But we need a system,
2011040	2014880	a food system that can feed what seven billion people at this point, eight billion we're on our
2014880	2020240	way to. Eight, excuse me, thank you. I always forget how many billions. Because when I was a kid,
2020240	2025280	let me just say, one of the fucking weirdest things in my entire life is I remember being in
2025280	2030800	high school and being told there are six billion people on earth. And then I remember 10 years
2030800	2035040	later, it was like, hey, now it's seven. And I was like, how there's a billion more people
2036480	2043280	when I was just like, you know, when I was like watching DVDs and, you know, like taking the
2043280	2050000	bus home from school, like how did what a massive change. And yet everything looks the same to me
2050000	2055280	when I'm walking down the street. It's bizarre. And now we're now we have eight. So we've added
2056000	2061440	a quarter as many people or third as many people has already existed when I was a kid.
2061440	2066080	In the last couple of decades, we got to feed all of them. So, you know, how the hell can we
2066080	2070480	have a food system that feeds these people food that they want to eat without destroying the environment?
2070480	2075840	So I think there's, I think there's two big solutions or things we need to do here.
2075840	2081040	I think the very first, the first one is we just, we need to produce food very, very efficiently.
2081120	2087840	And by that, we need high crop yields. Now, if you go back to, you know, the 1960s or the 1970s,
2087840	2092400	you know, the big crisis at that point, and what people were talking about was the world running
2092400	2098720	out of food, right? We saw this really rapid increase in the global population. And basically,
2098720	2103600	conclusion was, there's no way that we will be able to feed everyone. And then, you know, there
2103600	2110560	was the, the population bomb was the book that came out in 1968 by Paul R. Erlich. And that predicted,
2110560	2115280	you know, just, we're just going to have so many millions of people dying from famine and just
2115280	2119360	wouldn't be able to feed everyone. And that hasn't come true. And that hasn't come true because we
2119360	2125120	had what we call the Green Revolution, where we just see crop yields across the world just skyrocket.
2125120	2129520	You know, you're getting doubling, tripling, quadrupling of crop yields, which means that
2129520	2134240	despite having, you know, billions more people, the amount of food we produce per person has
2134240	2138800	still gone up. You know, we've seen a massive increase. I mean, going forward, that's also
2138880	2143680	really key. What happens if you increase crop yields is you obviously get more food. But the
2143680	2149280	key point is you, you grow it on less land, which means you need to cut down less forests. You need
2149280	2155040	to, you know, go into less wild habitats. You can, you can use much less land for farming. So that's
2155040	2161440	number one. And then number two is just, we just need to see massive global dietary change.
2162640	2168480	The biggest impact by far of our food systems is, is, is meat and dairy consumption. And we do need
2168560	2174400	to find a way of reducing that. But I, I completely agree with you that I think the, the message of
2174400	2179360	we just all need to go vegan tomorrow is just like not going to work. Yeah. And actually,
2179360	2185840	how do we, I'm fascinated to hear you say that then because I, I agree. I agree with both points,
2185840	2191120	right? And so how do we square that circle? How do we reduce, and by the way, in the last couple
2191120	2196960	years, there's been a huge amount of interest in meat replacement foods. There was like a brief
2197040	2201200	fad for them in the United States. For a couple of years, I was buying impossible burgers and
2201200	2206960	beyond burgers. And now I never want to eat one of those things for as long as I live. Like I,
2206960	2214240	I ate so many impossible burgers that I can like picture the taste like, and it repulses me at
2214240	2218800	this point. And, you know, God willing, they come up with a different version that, that tastes a
2218800	2222400	little different and is a little bit more of an actual replacement. But, you know, unfortunately,
2222400	2228800	that industry turned out to not have the results that it promised investors and the public. So
2229840	2233920	what, yeah, what do we do to reduce meat consumption if all those things we sort of
2233920	2238560	are agreed might not be the answer? I mean, I think the, I mean, I think I should say that I think,
2238560	2243920	I think food is way harder to tackle than energy. I think on energy, I think people,
2244560	2249360	for the most part, they just want, you know, cheap energy coming out of the socket, right? And if
2249360	2254400	you can provide that for them, they don't really care where it comes from. For food, people really
2254400	2258960	care about what they eat. And it's like a such a strong part of the identity and their freedom,
2258960	2263120	right? Try to tell someone what to eat and they will immediately push back, which is why I think
2263120	2268000	this is a much harder problem to tackle. Yeah. I mean, I think the, I mean, I think the key thing
2268000	2273440	there is trying to sell it to someone is all or nothing. Like you either eat meat or you don't
2273440	2278480	eat meat is not going to work, right? I think you need to find a way of reducing meat consumption
2278480	2283200	or giving people options to reduce meat consumption and starting there. And then they might progress
2283200	2287360	towards, you know, a more and more plant-based diet over time. I think you're not going to get that
2287360	2295040	overnight. I mean, I think for me, I think we will need to rely on solutions that produce
2295040	2299760	almost complete mimics of meat that we're currently eating. I guess I'm probably pretty
2299760	2304880	pessimistic that people just accept, you know, we'll just eat beans and lentils and that'll be fine.
2304880	2308800	I think for most people, they basically want a substitute for meat, which means we need to
2308800	2313440	produce meat without the animal. And there are innovations coming through on this. The problem
2313440	2318800	is that they are currently too expensive and we haven't scaled them yet. Are you correct?
2318800	2324240	Yeah. I've read accounts of the current state of lab-grown meat where they're like
2324240	2331280	sort of making like a lattice of animal cells, like very painstakingly in a lab and like one on
2331280	2336160	top of the other and like, okay, we've made the perfect artificial steak and it only costs
2336160	2344000	$100,000 a pound or whatever. It's like encouraging work, but it's not really close to market yet.
2344000	2350640	Is that right? Yeah. I mean, I think the costs are falling pretty rapidly still. I mean, yeah,
2350640	2355280	$100,000 would have been, you know, the price, you know, maybe a decade or so ago, but they've
2355280	2360720	fallen quite fast since then. And actually, I think on cost, they might be competitive,
2360720	2366160	you know, in the next five or so years. Really? I mean, the scalability will be the problem. It's
2366160	2371920	like how you then take that, you know, really fine, your created process and scale that up,
2371920	2375760	you know, to produce hundreds of millions of tons of meat. I mean, that will be the big problem
2376320	2382160	rather than the economics of it. Yeah. And we also have the problem with the food system of
2382160	2387920	people's health. I mean, as you say, since, you know, the population bomb was written in the last
2388000	2393440	50 years, there's been this enormous explosion of food production, which is great sort of
2393440	2397200	demographically, right? If you're looking at, okay, we produced enough food for all of these
2397200	2403040	8 billion people. But if you look at at least, you know, the dietary health of people in the
2403040	2409360	United States, it is poor. And you have to lay some of that at the feet of our food system.
2409360	2413840	It's not people need to make better choices. It's people need better choices in the supermarket.
2413840	2419360	The food that is being rammed down people's throats is not what it should be because of,
2420320	2425520	I would say the pressures of capitalism on these food producers to make food more cheaply and etc.
2426720	2432560	And so, you know, we have this explosion in the number of calories we're creating, but there
2432560	2438880	may be not the calories that are best for people's health. And I could imagine something similar
2438880	2444240	happening if we have our meat substituted, like we probably need, you know, some amount
2444240	2449120	of regulations in place or somebody thinking about like, let's make sure we shape this system
2449120	2452880	so that we're not producing, you know, we're feeding people and we're also not feeding them
2452880	2458080	shit, right? Yeah, no, I agree. I think the quality of the meat substitutes or, you know,
2458080	2464480	whatever we replace it with will be really important. And to some extent, that could be
2464560	2472400	another lever to encourage people to move away from particular products. Like I think as I was
2472400	2477440	saying, I think the transition in food is a much harder sell for people. But what people really
2477440	2482560	care about is their health. So if we can produce products that are one more environmentally friendly
2482560	2488320	and also better for people's health, that could be another lever to encourage people to make that
2488320	2494240	transition. I mean, I think there are a range of studies looking at, you know, the health benefits
2494320	2498000	of moving to a more plant-based diet doesn't necessarily mean a completely plant-based
2498000	2504080	diet, but a more plant-based diet. And they tend to result in slightly better health outcomes
2504080	2509280	for people. And that might not be because necessarily they're eating less meat. But I think
2509280	2514080	often when people transition to a more plant-based diet, they automatically increase the diversity
2514080	2518720	of foods that they're eating, right? Like they diversify different meals, they eat a bit more
2518720	2524000	veg, a bit more fruit, a bit more of various different foods. So overall, the quality of
2524000	2528640	their diet might improve and diversify. So I think that the health lens of this is also really,
2528640	2536160	really critical. Yeah. And when I think you can make the argument to people, hey, if you eat less
2536160	2541520	meat, if you diversify your diet, you're going to be healthier. That is an appealing message to
2541520	2549200	people, you know, people want to feel better about what they eat. And I think if we sort of
2549200	2558400	abandon the monkish devotion to, I never again shall meat pass my lips. And that's fine for those
2558400	2561920	who want to make that moral commitment. I think that's a wonderful moral commitment to make and
2561920	2568400	I support it. But if we can focus on reducing, diversifying for everybody in general, we can
2568400	2574800	make huge, huge gains without requiring people to, without requiring people to give up so much if
2574800	2579360	they don't want to. Is that sort of what it is? Yeah, exactly. I think for a lot of people,
2580320	2585440	even that first step would seem overwhelming. You know, how on earth do I eat a vegan diet?
2585440	2591040	Like what do I eat? And I actually think as you graduate, as people are gradually exposed
2591040	2595760	towards, you know, eating a bit less meat or substituting, you know, one meal, you know,
2595760	2602000	a day or a day a week for a more plant-based diet, they then start to learn stuff that they can eat.
2602000	2606640	And oh, I actually quite like this substitute or I like this different meal that I've made.
2606640	2611120	I think then they become more comfortable with it over time and might be able to take it further.
2611120	2615840	But I think the overwhelm initially of, okay, I suddenly have to eat a completely vegan diet,
2615840	2621680	you know, really puts people off. So I think we need to take people on baby steps along the way.
2621680	2626480	And then they might end up a vegan diet at the end of the road. But I think most people will not
2626480	2633200	jump immediately to that. Yeah. I mean, my own thing was like 10 years ago, I read a book by
2633200	2638400	the cookbook author, Mark Bitman, called Vegan Before Six, where he had, he's like,
2638400	2642240	here's my diet plan. I eat vegan before 6 p.m. and then I have whatever I want for dinner.
2642240	2647120	And I did that for a year or two. And then I just sort of learned, oh, here's a bunch of vegan
2647120	2652080	meals I can make myself. And so now I eat vegan quite often. Not, I'm not a permanent vegan,
2652080	2656240	but like, you know, more often than not, I'm like, oh, let me try to have a vegan meal today.
2656960	2663520	And I think getting that sort of muscle memory into people so that they know how to do it enables
2663520	2669760	them to make those choices, et cetera. Now, vegans in the comments, I know you're yelling,
2669760	2673840	everyone should just go vegan. It's fine. Like keep doing what you're doing. But we are trying to
2674480	2678560	get as many people under the tent as possible. And having a little bit of allowance for where
2678560	2683120	people are currently at, I think, helps us do that, right? Yeah, exactly. I mean, I've had this
2683120	2690640	dilemma myself. So I'm now a vegan. And I wasn't, you know, three years or so ago. And I've actually
2690640	2696480	questioned over the years, am I more effective in this role as a vegan, or as someone that's not a
2696480	2701040	vegan, but strongly encourages, you know, meat reduction? Like I sometimes have this kind of
2701600	2706240	block of if I, you know, people find out I'm a vegan, you know, they don't take my message
2706240	2711680	seriously, or they think I'm like way too extreme. Or, you know, they can't visualize how they would
2711680	2717040	get from where they are to where I am. Whereas if I was someone that, you know, didn't eat meat that
2717040	2722320	often, maybe didn't eat beef, ate some chicken or fish, they might find that more relatable. And
2722320	2728720	therefore they might actually feel like there was a shorter gap between where they are and where I am.
2728720	2733440	I mean, in the end, I just went vegan anyway. But I have questioned, you know, what's the most
2733440	2740480	effective, you know, communication strategy there or where to place yourself to reach a bigger cohort
2740480	2746080	of people? Yeah, it does. It is funny that if you're talking to a vegan, and you're feeling bad about
2746080	2752240	yourself, and then they reveal, I eat fish sometimes, and you're like, Oh, oh, thank God. Oh, okay,
2752240	2756080	all right, okay. So there's, there's some hope for me yet, you know, like it, it's just having,
2756640	2764000	having a little bit of flex, like makes people a little bit relieved. So I really love that
2764000	2769760	we're making progress in so many areas. I am curious, though, are there any areas where we're
2769760	2776000	putting a lot of effort into reducing our carbon emissions that are not so effective? That, you
2776000	2780640	know, are things that, you know, hey, we should direct our efforts elsewhere? Are there any
2780640	2786320	current initiatives that you are a skeptic about? I mean, I think the, I think on, on climate change
2786320	2791440	specifically, I mean, I think the, the issue there is that I think there's a lot of people that are
2791440	2796320	really well intentioned. They want to make a difference. They want to cut their carbon footprint,
2796320	2800880	but they don't have good information to base that on. And they often misplace their effort.
2801840	2806160	And the issue there is that they do the stuff that has a really tiny impact or sometimes a negative
2806160	2811280	impact. And then they miss the really big stuff. So when you look, for example, if you look at
2811280	2815280	surveys, you know, asking people, you know, what's the best thing you can do for the environment,
2815280	2819440	or the best thing you can do to cut your carbon footprint, they mentioned stuff like recycling,
2820080	2825440	or, you know, reusing a plastic bag or turning off the lights. And, and these are, you know,
2825440	2830240	fine to do, do them, but they're small in the magnitude of things. And actually they miss the
2830320	2835600	stuff, like adopting a more plant based diet, or, or they even miss stuff like, you know,
2835600	2840160	switching to the electric car. So they, they're focusing on the really tiny stuff and putting
2840160	2845120	effort in there, and then missing the really big stuff. And what I think was really key is if we're
2845120	2850240	to have a hope of tackling this, you know, we're past the stage of the little stuff, right? We need
2850240	2856080	to be focusing on the big stuff. So I think that's the issue that people have is also often
2856080	2860720	misplaced effort, when there's actually a list of, you know, maybe five big things that really
2860720	2867680	matter. And then the rest is more like a rounding error. Yeah. Well, recycling is such a contentious
2867680	2874400	one, because a lot of people have an awareness that, you know, recycling, at least how it's
2874400	2882480	practiced in the US is, in many ways, a bit of a PR attempt by the plastics industry to,
2882480	2887280	you know, distract from the waste that they caused. Hey, if we put that little triangle on
2887280	2891600	the thing and say it's recyclable, then people will think, Oh, it's not so bad to buy one,
2891600	2895760	and it'll remove the guilt from them. And then we'll shift the burden of being responsible
2895760	2900480	onto the consumer. Now, I don't, I believe all that is true. I know all that is true. I've,
2900480	2906640	I've studied it and done content on it myself. But that doesn't stop me from throwing all that
2906640	2910320	shit in the blue bin, blue bin, because, Hey, why not? If some of us being recycled, whatever,
2910320	2915040	I don't stress out about it too much. But I think that that breeds a cynicism in people that, Hey,
2915040	2919600	these solutions that we're being presented are capitalist schemes by people who are trying
2919600	2926080	to get us to buy more. And I don't know. I think that is what leads a lot of people to say, Oh,
2926080	2930640	we're never going to solve this problem unless we do something about our economic system overall,
2930640	2936240	that we change its structure. And, you know, that we have a rapacious economic system that is
2936240	2941920	gobbling everything up, that always wants more demands, endless growth, mines the planet for
2941920	2949040	resources, mines our labor to reduce it to its lowest possible cost, and is just, you know,
2949040	2954960	a fire that's consuming the planet until it's all gone. That's a very apocalyptic view. But I'm
2954960	2960560	curious what you think about, you know, our economic system itself and how it contributes to the
2960560	2968080	problem or if we can actually solve it under capitalism? I mean, I think that was a lot.
2969760	2973680	I like to give a lot at this point in the conversation. I'm sensing you're a big fan of
2973680	2979760	capitalism. No, I think, I think, I think those are all very valid points. I mean, I think it's
2979760	2986320	very fair to say that capitalism has got us into this mess. Release has played a massive role in
2986320	2995200	getting us into this mess. I think you can still make the argument that it can play some role in
2995200	3001520	getting us out of it now. Or at least another way I'd frame it is that to me, I'm not sure we have
3001520	3009280	a choice at this stage of trying to utilize some of the positives of capitalism, which, you know,
3009280	3015120	we discussed earlier, the kind of free market economics of energy costs and technological
3015120	3020320	change. I think that's like one benefit of this. There are obviously still massive downsides. The
3020320	3028720	question is, can you garner the benefits of the system, but also try to address and pull down
3028720	3035360	some of the downsides of the system? Right. To me, that seems more realistic than deciding,
3035360	3039520	we're just going to rip up the system and build a new one, especially on the timescales that we're
3039520	3043280	talking about here, right? We're talking about tackling this, you know, we need to really get
3043280	3047040	moving on. I mean, we should have got moving on this 20 years ago, but now we really need to get
3047040	3052320	moving on this. And we're talking about, you know, decarbonizing our electricity grids in the UK
3052320	3060640	or the US in five to 10 years. And I'm skeptical that we can tear down an economic system and
3060640	3066000	build a new one on that timescale. Maybe if we're talking about this over 70 years, then we might
3066000	3071120	have a way of, you know, working on our economic system first, and then deciding how we tackle our
3071120	3076800	environmental problems later. So I think we, in some sense, are stuck in the economic system
3076800	3081600	that we're in. But that doesn't mean we need to accept all of the, all of the aspects of it,
3081600	3086400	or just accept it as the status quo. I think there are things we can do within that system
3086400	3091840	to, to utilize the benefits and try to push down some of the major downsides of it.
3092480	3098960	I agree with you entirely. I mean, I'm a critic of our economic system. And I agree that capitalism
3098960	3104880	has gotten us into this mess. And I'm a person who is constantly wanting to envision something
3104880	3111280	better. However, I don't think that we can, we have time to wait, you know, I don't think we
3111280	3115680	have time to say, Hey, let's, let's figure out the economic system first and then deal with climate
3115680	3121520	change. We can do both things at once. And, you know, we can be realists about the world that
3121520	3126480	we live in and try to make, you know, the changes that we need to make in that world under the
3126480	3133280	system that we're in, as we also try to envision a better system and, and build it. And, you know,
3133280	3138160	I do take issue when people say, Ah, that's, you know, as people are probably going to say in the
3138160	3142880	comments of this video when we posted on YouTube, capitalism did this, we need to uproot capitalism.
3142880	3149760	Yes. And we also need to, we need to actually solve the problem that we actually face in the
3149760	3156160	limited amount of time that we have. And it is not an either or a problem. It is an and, and,
3156160	3161520	and, and problem. So thank you so much for that. Yeah, I agree. And I think, I mean, I think the,
3161520	3166320	I think the argument is often, well, we're just going to take the current system,
3167040	3171200	energy system, for example, that we're in, and we're just solving it for a different one. And,
3171200	3175440	and it's just going to be just as bad, and it's going to be so as extractive as it was before.
3175520	3179280	And again, I think this comes a little bit back to these kinds of perfect solutions,
3180080	3184640	this hunt for perfect solutions. I mean, I think we need to be real realistic that, you know,
3185520	3190640	this is not about maintaining the status quo, but like this, the rebuilding our energy system is,
3190640	3195280	you know, the biggest, ultimately, one of the biggest challenges we're going to face. And we're
3195280	3200480	just going to see really dramatic changes here. So I don't think we should underestimate how,
3200480	3204400	you know, big this transformation is that we're asking even in the food system, right? We're
3204400	3209840	trying to completely transform our food system, completely transform our energy system or industry,
3209840	3215840	you know, transport systems. So these are really kind of revolutionary changes. I think we should
3215840	3220160	underplay that. But on the kind of extractive component, I think, you know, we're trying to move
3220160	3225520	away from a fossil fuel system, which is just take, take, take, right? When you extract fossil
3225520	3230400	fuels, you burn them, they're done, right? You need to extract more, you do this every, every year.
3230400	3235920	And there we're talking about, you know, extracting 15 billion tons of fossil fuels every year.
3236480	3241120	Now, we move to low carbon energy, for example, we will also need to extract minerals. That's
3241120	3245600	completely true. And we need to be conscious of the environmental impact of that. But what's key
3245600	3250400	is that we are talking about, you know, orders of magnitude, less minerals, you know, talking about
3251120	3256960	tens to hundreds of millions of tons compared to 15 billion tons of fossil fuels every single year.
3256960	3262160	I think the key point of this transition as well is that you don't need to extract this year after
3262160	3266960	year after year, right? You can start to then recycle those minerals, you know, at the end of
3266960	3272560	a solar panel's life for a wind turbine and put that back into the system. So we will need a ramp
3272560	3276720	up period initially, because we just need to build lots of new stuff. But we'll hopefully
3276720	3282560	reach a position where a lot of that can be recycled. And we get to more of a, you know, circular
3282560	3287760	economy approach that people discuss, rather than just an extractive take, take, take one.
3288480	3294800	Yeah. And what I love about that is that you're depicting us as taking a step towards the world
3294800	3299360	we want. If you're someone listening to or watching this podcast who says capitalism is
3299360	3304480	extractive and I, that's something I hate about it, well, you're describing an energy system that
3304480	3310880	is far less extractive, right, that is pulling less out of the earth, ultimately, especially if
3310880	3318400	we're able to, as you say, reuse some of the minerals that we extract. And so that is addressing
3318400	3323120	part of the problem that you are trying to address. We're not ripping out the whole thing and replacing
3323120	3329600	it in a day, but we are taking a step towards the world that we want, which I think is really
3329600	3334080	important. And we talk about many issues on this show, whether we're talking about the criminal
3334080	3338320	justice system, right? Some folks are prison abolitionists, police abolitionists. I'm like,
3338400	3345440	hey, I don't disagree with the world that you're envisioning. Let's take steps in the meantime
3345440	3352560	to build forms of justice that are alternatives to policing, so we can show people how it works
3352560	3357600	and reduce our reliance on a day-to-day basis, rather than just focusing on the far-off horizon.
3357600	3362640	We also need to take steps towards that world today under the system that we live in. And that's
3362640	3370000	what you're talking about doing, which is why I love it so much. Are you ever, though, like,
3371680	3380880	is there ever a pessimist bone in your body about it? Is there a world that you see us
3380880	3385120	possibly heading towards that you're trying to steer us away from? Because sometimes I do know
3385120	3391280	that the optimist's point of view, especially for a climate activist, it can be a little bit of a
3391280	3395440	strategic choice, right? We need to be optimistic in order to do these things, and therefore it
3395440	3402240	makes sense to take a strategy of optimism and not be public about the fear that's in the back
3402240	3408480	of your head of like, oh, what if we don't do these things, right? So are you still powered by fear
3408480	3413760	to some degree, or are you really like confident, hey, all of these great things are going to happen
3413760	3420000	if we all keep pulling? No, definitely. Like, the fear is still there. Like, I still lose a lot of
3420000	3428320	sleep over climate change. I guess I just try to balance that fear, and in some sense, anxiety
3428320	3434160	with also with the optimism that there is something we can do about it. Like, I'm very clear always on
3434160	3438560	my messaging and also in the book that, you know, the changes I describe in the book are not
3438560	3444560	inevitable in any way, right? I don't know if we will do it. I can't force us to do it, but they
3444560	3449440	are possible. And I think there's a massive opportunity there. And I think what we need at
3449440	3456880	the moment is a positive vision of the world we could live in as almost as a North Star. I think
3456880	3462800	there's a lot of the environmental messaging is almost built around damage limitation. And it's,
3462800	3467600	you know, you know, the world will inevitably be worse in the future. We just decide how bad it's
3467600	3473200	going to be. And I think actually we need a bit more of a positive vision of, no, actually, the
3473200	3478160	future can be better. It will not inevitably be better, but there is something better that we
3478240	3483680	can work towards. How do we go from where we are now to where we would want to be? So that's what
3483680	3489760	I try to do with my messaging is try to present, you know, a bit more of a positive vision of where
3489760	3494720	we're trying to go to, but also make clear that, you know, none of this inevitable. And, you know,
3494720	3498960	if we stay on our current path, you know, I'm very scared about what the future will look like,
3498960	3504080	because we're not on a good one. But I just have some level of optimism that we can get our act
3504080	3509360	together and bend that curve closer to, you know, the temperature changes that we want and are
3509360	3515520	achievable. So give me a little bit of that positive version of the or vision of the future,
3515520	3522560	right? Like paying us a little bit of a picture of, you know, here I am. Like I said, I, you know,
3522560	3527760	30 years ago, I was watching those cartoons, right? Captain Planet and whatnot. Today,
3527760	3531120	I'm in my 40s. I'm like, hey, we didn't do as much as I feel like we should have done.
3532080	3539600	But, you know, what is the world that I could live in when I'm 80 if we do all the things that
3539600	3544400	you say are possible? So if we, you know, get our act together and tackle this, you know, we won't,
3545040	3549600	I don't think we'll limit, you know, warming to 1.5 degrees. I think, you know, that's,
3549600	3555200	you know, a very laudable goal. But I think, you know, we have kind of left it too late to
3555200	3560480	achieve that. But I think the key point there is, you know, 1.5 degrees is not a cliff, right?
3560480	3565280	Like we are, we need to fight for temperature ranges above that because with each incremental
3565280	3570480	rising temperature, we increase risks. So I think 2 degrees is still within our grasp if we really
3570480	3575520	get our act together. So we could limit warming to below 2 degrees. We will see, you know, increased
3575520	3581440	impacts there, you know, but there are things that we can do to limit a lot of those impacts.
3581440	3587680	So we'll live in a world where hopefully the majority of the world have access to energy.
3587680	3592480	They have higher standards of living than they do today. Energy is very cheap.
3593760	3597840	We don't have these, you know, massive energy price shocks, you know, that we have in a fossil
3597840	3603600	fuel system because, you know, Putin invades Ukraine, like we've seen in the last few years.
3603600	3610560	So we have more stable and low energy prices. People who have access to the energy services
3610560	3614640	they need, you know, we have much more livable cities that aren't, you know, completely governed
3614640	3620720	by cars on the road. There are, you know, better communities where we can interact. You know, we
3620720	3625120	have cycle lanes, public transport, you know, people are walking, people can sit outdoors,
3625120	3631200	they can dine outdoors. We have clean air to breathe so people aren't dying from air pollution.
3631200	3636400	You know, we don't kill, you know, more than 70 billion animals every year for food, but we still
3636400	3642320	have, you know, really tasty nutritious diets. We've got zero deforestation because we've brought
3642320	3648640	that to an end. And we have, you know, these amazing wild landscapes coming back and wild
3648640	3655280	animals coming back. That is a beautiful vision. And you feel very confident that we can get there.
3655280	3660720	You at least feel optimistic that we can get there. Yeah, these goals are completely achievable.
3660720	3666240	Whether we do them is up to us. And I mean, us, you know, at a very large collective level,
3666240	3671680	but they're there for us. And I think the key point and what I try to communicate in my messaging
3671680	3677840	is that this transition is not a sacrifice. I mean, often this environmental stuff is posed as
3677840	3682720	a sacrifice. It's, you know, oh, we'll just have to cut back or we'll just have to sacrifice this
3682720	3688640	in order to preserve the future. And that's fine. Actually, that messaging is fine if that's the
3688640	3694080	correct, you know, notation and the correct idea and correct message there. And maybe we should
3694080	3697920	just sacrifice, but we actually don't need to sacrifice because the changes we're making are
3697920	3703680	opportunities. So we have opportunities in the short term and it also leads to good benefits
3703680	3709680	over the long term. And I think we need to reframe our messaging here away from, you know,
3709680	3716560	sacrifice towards one of opportunity and abundance. Yeah, that it's the classic scarcity
3716560	3725680	mentality versus abundance mentality that we do not have to have worse lives. We do not have to
3725680	3730640	live in a worse world in order to prevent these outcomes. Actually, everything will be better.
3730640	3738240	We will all have more, more healthy, more vibrant, more prosperous lives if we were to make this
3738240	3744640	transition. I also, I love the name of your book so much, not the end of the world because it is such
3744640	3753040	a deep philosophical thing that people think the world is ending. And like it's, it's not possible
3753040	3759120	for it to end, right? Like you are, unless you personally die, right, you are going to wake up
3759120	3764240	in a world that exists and it is going to be better or worse, you know, and you are going
3764240	3769840	to have to live in it and you have some amount of control. We all have some amount of control over
3769840	3774880	what that world is based on our actions today. And no matter how bad things are, we have the
3774880	3781040	opportunity to do something that is going to make the world that we're going to wake up in tomorrow
3781040	3786960	a little bit better, a little bit worse. And so when I think about it that way, it makes me realize
3786960	3793200	this mentality that like the world is ending is nothing but a cop-out. It's, it's, it's false and
3793200	3800400	all it does is absolve you fictionally of that, of that power. It takes power away from you to
3800400	3805760	say that about the world. Yeah, I think that's the high extreme again. If you, you know, tell yourself
3805760	3809920	that the world is doomed and it's too late to tackle these problems and it is the end of the
3809920	3815280	world, then yeah, your reaction to that is, well, if it's over, then, you know, why, why, why should
3815280	3819680	I take action anyway? You know, it won't make a difference. Maybe we should just, you know,
3819680	3823600	enjoy the remaining of our lives that we have left because nothing we do now is going to change
3823600	3828720	things. And that, again, I think that's a cop-out because that's just not the reality. And that
3828720	3833600	type of approach and that, you know, messaging is not going to get us to where we need to be. I
3833600	3838960	think we need to reframe our discussions around this of, yes, these are very serious problems.
3839040	3843760	For some people, these actually are existential problems. Like people will die. People are dying
3843760	3848320	from air pollution. People are dying from climate change and people will die from climate change.
3848320	3855120	So for some people, this is really an existential threat. But we have the capacity to reduce those
3855120	3860000	risks, to reduce those dangers and actually not just, you know, have this damage limitation
3860720	3865760	vision, but also a better vision of actually improving the world going forward rather than
3865760	3872320	just trying to stop some of the damage. Yeah. And I mean, once you start thinking about that way,
3873120	3879680	it makes you realize how big of an opportunity you have because it's sort of, you go from thinking,
3879680	3884320	ah, what can I do to fight climate change or to fight these problems to thinking, oh,
3884880	3891760	everything that I do can be a solution. You know, like, whether it's eating vegan or it's,
3891760	3896720	you know, getting the electric car or it's doing policy work or whatever, like every single thing
3896720	3903280	that you do is a move in the right direction if you choose for it to be. And it can be massively
3903280	3908400	empowering to think about it that way. Yeah, exactly. And I think the, as I was saying earlier, I
3908400	3912800	think, I mean, these are, you know, massive transitions that we're doing and they touch
3912800	3918320	on basically every sector, which means that, you know, regardless of, you know, what you're working
3918320	3924720	in or where you're working or what you're doing, you know, these issues are touching you and you
3924720	3930720	can have a positive impact on that. Like, I think we often think of what you can do in environmentalism
3930720	3937360	as just, you know, how do I reduce my carbon footprint? And that's fine. And I give recommendation
3937360	3942160	of how people can do that most effectively. But I think we should also be more ambitious about
3942160	3947120	that. You know, my contribution is not just going to be how do I limit my footprint as much as
3947120	3952000	possible. I actually want to offset that and more by the positive impacts that I make, whether it's,
3952000	3957920	you know, communicating to others, whether it's someone, you know, working in politics, working
3957920	3964000	in engineering or finance or, you know, we all play a role in trying to shift all of these systems
3964000	3969280	into a more sustainable path. And actually, you know, regardless of what you do, you're probably
3969280	3977760	hitting on those every day. Yes. And this is why I'm so against people putting themselves in a
3977760	3981360	position of powerlessness. And a lot of times when I'm arguing with what I think people are
3981360	3985120	going to write in the comments, it's me arguing with that. People say, oh, we can't do anything
3985120	3991280	because capitalism. No, you can do a hell of a lot. And it's not only your responsibility,
3991280	3997280	it's your opportunity to do so. And if you don't take it, you are, you're putting yourself in a
3997280	4002720	position you're declaring that you have no power when the opposite is true. I so appreciate you
4002720	4007760	coming on today to dispel some of my lingering pessimism and tell me why I'm wrong about it.
4007760	4011760	I absolutely loved it. The name of the book is not the end of the world. People can, of course,
4011760	4018160	get it at our special bookshop, factuallypod.com slash books. But where can people find you online,
4018160	4024720	Hannah? And how can they get involved in this fight? Yeah, so I, maybe one of the best places is
4024800	4030480	I work for a project called Our World in Data. And that's a website. And we have data and research
4030480	4034800	on not just climate change and environment, but what we frame as the world's largest problems.
4034800	4039360	So you can go on there and look at all the data to try to understand what's going on in the world.
4039360	4043360	It's an incredible resource. It's really an amazing site. People should go check it out,
4043360	4050320	Our World in Data. Yeah, I have a substack called Sustainability by Numbers, where I try to understand
4050320	4055600	these problems on environment and climate through numbers. So not about like gut feelings or, you
4055600	4061040	know, intuitions or anecdotes. We're actually looking at the data on electric vehicles, for example.
4063760	4068320	I was really going based on gut feelings and anecdotes. And so you bringing numbers was an
4068320	4072640	important corrective to that. I love that. Sustainability in Numbers. Yeah. And I think how
4072640	4077600	people can contribute this like in so many ways. I think there is the, you know, reducing your
4077600	4083200	personal carbon footprint bit, which is important. But I think much more wider than that. I think a key
4083200	4087600	one is just, you know, how do you contribute, you know, from your career, for example, a lot of people,
4087600	4091920	especially younger people are deciding, you know, what should I do with my life? If you're
4091920	4096960	interested in this area, there are so many areas that you can get involved and make a positive
4096960	4102000	difference, whether that's in engineering, whether that's becoming an electricity into, you know,
4102560	4107120	massively enhance the grid or install heat pumps, whether it's spreading the message
4107120	4111360	through art. I mean, there's so many ways that you can do this in a much more positive way.
4111360	4117200	And then obviously also really key to that is trying to influence politics. And as we discussed
4117200	4122160	markets, I think you also have an impact on the market by the stuff that you buy. When you're
4122160	4126080	buying an EV, you're signaling, you know, we're done with petrol and diesel cars.
4126800	4131600	The world is moving towards electric cars. I think we can also have an impact politically and
4131600	4136320	on our market systems. Thank you so much for coming on, Hannah. I can't thank you enough.
