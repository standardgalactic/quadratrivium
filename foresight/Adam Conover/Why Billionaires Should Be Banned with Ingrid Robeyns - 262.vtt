Hello and welcome to Factually. I'm Adam Conover. Thank you so much for joining me on the show again.

00:04.640 --> 00:09.120
You know, we all know that poverty is a bad thing and I think most of us agree

00:09.120 --> 00:14.240
that the world would be a better place if poverty didn't exist or at least were greatly reduced.

00:14.240 --> 00:19.200
It's not just the human suffering that makes poverty bad. It's also bad for an entire society

00:19.200 --> 00:25.600
if a large group of people can barely survive. That's why LBJ waged a war on poverty and in the

00:25.600 --> 00:33.040
booming 1960s, the poverty rate indeed went down a huge 39%. But if we won a couple battles on

00:33.040 --> 00:40.400
poverty back then, we have lost the war since. You know, we had a 13% poverty rate in 1980

00:40.400 --> 00:48.320
and an 11.5% poverty rate in 2000. But that rate was basically the same last year, 23 years later.

00:48.320 --> 00:52.320
And you know, we talked to some extent in this country about how poverty is bad. We should

00:52.320 --> 00:58.320
talk about it more. But you know what we almost never discuss? How bad extreme wealth is. The

00:58.320 --> 01:05.440
super wealthy are bad for our society. America has 800 billionaires. They're mainly men and it is

01:05.440 --> 01:10.560
obviously bad that these people have so much money because just as being poor makes you less

01:10.560 --> 01:16.080
likely to be able to participate in society as a citizen. Huge amounts of wealth give you a gross

01:16.080 --> 01:21.520
and unfair amount of political power. And you know what? Since we live in a democracy, I think

01:21.600 --> 01:26.000
that's a bad thing. You know, we're happy to have conversations about getting rid of poverty,

01:26.000 --> 01:31.040
but why are we so much less comfortable talking about eradicating extreme wealth? Because if

01:31.040 --> 01:36.640
extreme wealth is just as damaging to our society as poverty, why can't we imagine waging a war on

01:36.640 --> 01:41.360
that too? It's not just a foregone conclusion that we live in a society where some people are

01:41.360 --> 01:46.720
unelected god emperors with treasure palaces and apocalypse bunkers and unilateral control over

01:46.720 --> 01:52.640
our political system. It is not right or natural that unearned hereditary wealth can be passed down

01:52.640 --> 01:57.920
for centuries. Last time I checked, we had a couple revolutions to end that sort of thing and then

01:57.920 --> 02:03.440
we were all taught in school that it's bad. So concentration of wealth and power is simply

02:03.440 --> 02:08.640
undemocratic. And if you think democracy is the right system to decide how we run our society

02:08.640 --> 02:14.560
collectively, well, I think you'd have to say that that concentration is bad. So what kind of

02:14.560 --> 02:19.760
arguments can we actually make against the existence of the wealthy? What limits should

02:19.760 --> 02:25.840
be placed on wealth and why? This is a radical conversation to have, but it gets less radical

02:25.840 --> 02:30.400
the more you consider it. There's a name for the philosophical view that wealth should be

02:30.400 --> 02:35.920
drastically limited. It's called libertarianism. And my guest today came up with this view and

02:35.920 --> 02:40.000
has advanced the very best arguments for it. But before we get into the argument,

02:40.000 --> 02:43.120

03:04.000 --> 03:09.040
is the political philosopher Ingrid Robins. She holds the chair in ethics of institutions at the

03:09.040 --> 03:14.640
Ethics Institute of Utrecht University and her new book is called Limiterianism, The Case Against

03:14.640 --> 03:21.840
Extreme Wealth. Please welcome Ingrid Robins. Ingrid, thank you so much for being on the show with us

03:21.840 --> 03:26.320
today. Thank you for having me. So tell me a little bit about your background, the work that you do

03:26.320 --> 03:31.600
and why you have concluded that it is a bad thing for us to have billionaires striding around the

03:31.600 --> 03:37.440
earth. Yes. So I'm actually going to argue that it's not just bad to have billionaires, but that

03:37.440 --> 03:44.880
it's bad to have deca millionaires, people who have more than 10 million euros, pounds, dollars

03:44.880 --> 03:50.720
in a context such as the Netherlands. But I'm sure we will get to that later. So I'm a professor

03:50.720 --> 03:57.280
of political philosophy. I'm also trained as an economist and I have been working in my academic

03:57.280 --> 04:04.640
research for the last 20 years on questions of inequality. And often when we think about inequality,

04:04.720 --> 04:09.520
especially economists, they focus on the poor. They think we should solve poverty. But I think

04:09.520 --> 04:16.240
we've now entered a phase in the history of human societies where we should also really

04:16.240 --> 04:21.520
increasingly worry about wealth and wealth concentration. Of course, I'm not the first

04:21.520 --> 04:26.400
to say this. I'm not the last to say this. But what I've tried to do is to write a book where

04:26.400 --> 04:30.160
I focused on the moral arguments. Why shouldn't we have people that are too rich?

04:30.800 --> 04:33.280
And so tell me what some of those arguments are. Why shouldn't we?

04:34.000 --> 04:40.320
Yeah. So it's actually, I have a number of them. There are different types. One is that often the

04:40.320 --> 04:46.160
money is earned in a way that makes it stained. So people should not have gotten it in the first

04:46.160 --> 04:52.960
place. An important argument is that it's too much wealth harm societies, either because it

04:52.960 --> 04:59.280
undermines democracy or because it's incompatible with principles of ecological sustainability.

04:59.280 --> 05:04.480
And then there is the fundamental philosophical argument that I think nobody can say they deserve

05:05.520 --> 05:09.760
to be super rich and deserve in a moral sense. And there's a final argument which

05:10.560 --> 05:14.720
some people don't take too serious, which is that it's actually not good for the super rich

05:14.720 --> 05:24.320
themselves because it doesn't make them happy. I'm sorry, that's the funniest argument. To go

05:24.320 --> 05:30.560
up to Jeff Bezos and be like, yeah, dude, but you're sad. I saw you crying. You are not a happy man.

05:31.200 --> 05:36.560
The thing is, there is actually some evidence that wealth accumulation works as an addiction.

05:36.560 --> 05:42.880
So if we are worried as human beings, that our fellow human beings can be addicted to any type

05:42.880 --> 05:48.960
of drugs, and we see that also in the brain accumulating money works in the same way,

05:48.960 --> 05:54.480
then we should probably also feel some empathy for those who are just locked up in this,

05:54.480 --> 05:59.520
not just desire, but this compulsion to just keep accumulating money. It does change the

05:59.520 --> 06:06.320
character of the super rich. That is basically the argument. And let me put it politely, not

06:06.320 --> 06:12.400
necessarily for the better. Yeah, it must be a compulsion to keep accumulating money because

06:12.400 --> 06:17.120
there is a point, I think we know from social science, very soon where you earn a certain

06:17.200 --> 06:23.680
amount of money and your happiness tops out. You don't get happier if you have $11 million

06:23.680 --> 06:29.520
versus $10 million, but there is a compulsion to keep earning more and to keep growing and growing.

06:30.640 --> 06:35.040
I feel it myself sometimes too when I'm making this podcast, I'm touring around doing stand-up

06:35.040 --> 06:39.840
comedy, and then I'm spending my nights writing a new YouTube video because I want to get a couple

06:39.840 --> 06:45.600
more views. And sometimes I go, wait, why am I doing this? Does it match my goals? And I look

06:45.600 --> 06:50.240
through, yeah, I think it does right now, but it also might just be that compulsion to do more,

06:50.240 --> 06:54.960
more, more all the time. And I could see that really, if you're a banker on Wall Street or

06:54.960 --> 06:59.600
something like that, and your entire job is that number at the bottom of your spreadsheet,

06:59.600 --> 07:03.200
there would be a compulsion to have more and more all the time, and there would be nothing else

07:03.200 --> 07:08.640
behind it. Yeah, so talking about Wall Street, there was a Wall Street trader, I can't remember

07:08.640 --> 07:13.680
the exact year, but I mean, about 10 years ago, who wrote a piece in the New York Times, and then

07:13.680 --> 07:20.560
later also a book where he mentioned that he was a Wall Street trader, he had no kids, no philanthropic

07:21.280 --> 07:28.960
goal to work for, no debts. And still he was angry because his annual bonus had only been like

07:28.960 --> 07:34.320
3 million, and why wasn't it more? And then he realized this was really like an addiction he

07:34.320 --> 07:42.400
had earlier, had some, some alcohol addiction, I think. And so that's really the idea of the

07:42.480 --> 07:49.600
addiction is, it's not an idea, there is really some, some evidence in how it works. And there's

07:49.600 --> 07:54.800
also an interesting little book written called The Psychology of Money by somebody who advises,

07:54.800 --> 08:01.360
who's a financial advisor, who also says, the only way to really not start to do kind of crazy

08:01.360 --> 08:06.880
things or criminal things or to let it take over your life is by just saying, okay, until here,

08:06.880 --> 08:12.160
and not further. This is my goal. And then that's all I need. That's all I want. And it,

08:12.160 --> 08:18.560
it, it liberates people to not want to want to have more. It gives peace of mind. But anyway,

08:18.560 --> 08:23.600
I actually think this argument for the super rich themselves, I mentioned it as the last one,

08:23.600 --> 08:28.800
because I think the really important ones are that it harms us and that it's undeserved. These

08:28.800 --> 08:32.480
are the fundamental ones. Well, let's get to those first. I mean, that was a very good piece of

08:32.480 --> 08:36.720
practical advice for Jeff Bezos, if he's listening to the show, set a limit, and then just

08:36.720 --> 08:43.600
stop Jeff and get some sleep. But you can look at what his ex-wife did. I know. She's giving it

08:43.600 --> 08:50.480
all away. And she's giving it away in a very interesting manner, because she, she's not like

08:50.480 --> 08:55.760
deciding what the money must go to, but she's giving it to organizations who within themselves

08:55.760 --> 09:00.080
take control and can decide what to do with it. Yeah. And we've talked about that in a, in a past

09:00.080 --> 09:04.560
episode of the show on billionaire philanthropy and the problems with it. And she's perhaps doing,

09:04.560 --> 09:11.120
there's still problems with philanthropy at that level, but she is sort of the least bad

09:11.840 --> 09:18.720
someone is giving money away for that reason. If you want to commend that at all. Let's talk,

09:18.720 --> 09:23.600
though, about this very enticing argument you make that no one deserves that amount of money.

09:23.600 --> 09:27.760
You say no one can really argue that they deserve that amount of money. I have to say,

09:27.760 --> 09:32.560
I live in the United States. I hear people make that argument every day. I mean, I've made,

09:32.640 --> 09:36.720
every time I make a video about Elon Musk, people say, Oh, well, you know, why don't you have all

09:36.720 --> 09:40.720
that money? It's because you suck. That's the only reason you don't have it. If you were as good

09:40.720 --> 09:45.520
and smart and wonderful a person as Elon, you would have earned the money because he deserved it,

09:45.520 --> 09:49.920
and you didn't. So what is your counter argument to that? Yeah. So, I mean, what you're just

09:49.920 --> 09:55.440
describing is really the way this, I mean, I think the word we should really use is ideology,

09:55.440 --> 10:01.920
this meritocrats, neoliberal ideology that, that puts always the focus on the individual

10:01.920 --> 10:06.640
and thinks that the individual deserves something. And if they are economically successful, it's

10:06.640 --> 10:11.680
because of their own something to do with themselves. If they're miserable, they can be blamed.

10:11.680 --> 10:17.680
That kind of framework, that kind of ideology, which we have increasingly come to think

10:18.560 --> 10:23.760
is not the only way to look at human beings. And actually, once upon a time, we looked

10:23.760 --> 10:29.840
differently at human beings. This way of thinking has, has also not fallen from the sky. It has come

10:29.840 --> 10:36.400
from a deliberate movement of first thinkers and then politicians who increasingly made us

10:36.400 --> 10:41.040
think like this. So this is just by way of background. So what do I think is based on

10:41.040 --> 10:49.120
what I've been reading in, in various types of scientific fields? What do I think is the real

10:49.120 --> 10:55.360
way we should look at human beings? I think we should put luck central. And luck comes in different

10:55.360 --> 11:02.080
forms. The first form is what you could call biological luck or the natural lottery. The

11:02.080 --> 11:08.720
genes you have are not of your own choice. So you can't say I chose my genes. The credits for my

11:08.720 --> 11:16.240
good genes are mine because you didn't choose your genes, your talents, your creativity. Also,

11:16.240 --> 11:23.120
the stamina, are you able to work really hard? Are you able to, to do long days,

11:23.120 --> 11:27.600
difference quite radically between people? There is only so much of this that can be really trained

11:27.600 --> 11:33.600
and learned. It is also just kind of difference between people. And if you happen to have what we

11:33.600 --> 11:38.960
philosophers call drone, a good, a good ticket from the natural lottery, you should count your

11:38.960 --> 11:43.760
blessings rather than saying, look what a fantastic human person I am. So that is the first type of

11:43.760 --> 11:50.560
luck. And the problem and why I focus on luck is because luck can never be the basis for dessert.

11:50.560 --> 11:55.840
That is the fundamental equation in this argument that if you want to say that you deserve

11:55.840 --> 12:01.040
something, you must always trace your achievement back to something for which you can take credit.

12:01.040 --> 12:06.480
And you can't, by definition, take credit for luck. So the first type of luck is natural luck.

12:06.480 --> 12:12.080
The second type is social luck. The parents you were born with, the social class, the city,

12:12.080 --> 12:18.320
the country. If you're born in the US, your opportunities are vastly bigger than if you're

12:18.880 --> 12:25.040
born in, say, Afghanistan. And we don't choose where we are born. We don't choose our parents,

12:25.040 --> 12:29.680
which also means we don't choose our inheritance, if any, because that's also a type of luck.

12:30.240 --> 12:38.080
And then the last type of luck is what economists call market luck. So if you have two entrepreneurs

12:38.080 --> 12:43.840
who are equally willing to really go the extra mile, put in all the hours, take the risks,

12:43.840 --> 12:49.520
then it can still be the case that one of them, because of the way markets work and they often

12:49.520 --> 12:56.960
allocate the big prices to one winner, its winner takes all markets, that their luck also plays a

12:56.960 --> 13:06.240
role. And while luck may only play a small role in deciding who takes the big price and who

13:06.240 --> 13:15.520
basically disappears or takes a smaller role, say, as an artist, luck sometimes is really the

13:15.520 --> 13:22.320
pivotal thing. So there is an interesting book written by an economist called Robert Frank,

13:22.320 --> 13:28.240
an American economist. It's called Success and Luck. I think that's the title. And he explains

13:28.240 --> 13:34.640
based on studies that, for example, if companies have to decide which CEO they need to hire,

13:35.360 --> 13:41.360
all these CEOs are extremely talented, they're very skilled, they are experienced.

13:42.320 --> 13:47.520
What then makes the difference? It's this tiny little bit of luck. So even though luck may not

13:47.520 --> 13:54.000
play in absolute numbers, a very big role in deciding who becomes very wealthy and who doesn't,

13:54.000 --> 14:00.640
it is the factor that makes a difference. So if we then embrace this view that luck plays

14:00.640 --> 14:06.480
such a big role in our lives, then I think the right attitude, if we're economically successful,

14:06.480 --> 14:12.400
if we become rich, is really to be generous towards those that were less lucky. And that,

14:12.400 --> 14:18.160
I totally agree, is really fundamentally at odds with the prevailing view in society.

14:19.520 --> 14:24.560
Yeah, with entrepreneurs so much of the time, it matters to be in the right place at the right

14:24.560 --> 14:30.800
time that if you were selling masks or video conference software in early 2020,

14:31.440 --> 14:36.560
something very lucky happened to you that March, that caused your business to skyrocket.

14:36.560 --> 14:41.600
It wasn't because of your great intelligence, you didn't know what was going to happen, etc.

14:41.600 --> 14:45.920
Or if you were, I don't know, making steel at the right time during World War II or whatever

14:45.920 --> 14:52.160
it was, that these things happen that we can't take personal responsibility for.

14:52.720 --> 14:58.640
I used to, one of the first philosophical questions I can remember asking myself as a child was,

14:59.520 --> 15:03.760
why am I here in the United States? Why is my consciousness here in the United States?

15:03.760 --> 15:08.000
And this body as opposed to any other. And it's still something that I find fundamentally

15:08.000 --> 15:13.200
mysterious. The fact that there's many humans and I am but one of them and I happen to be this one,

15:13.200 --> 15:18.240
and why am I not a different one? And it's a cosmic dice roll.

15:18.960 --> 15:27.120
Yeah, absolutely. And once you start to really realize the enormous luck we have to be born in

15:27.120 --> 15:34.480
a country where I feel still every day blessed that I'm also in a country, so I prefer countries that

15:34.480 --> 15:42.560
have decent social security systems. I mean, decent welfare states also for the compatriots

15:42.560 --> 15:46.640
that are less lucky, people who are disabled or who become unemployed or whatever.

15:47.600 --> 15:52.880
Yeah, I still feel lucky that I happened to be here. I could also have been somewhere else.

15:53.600 --> 15:58.880
And I think once you realize this, I mean, so it's really, so it's both like, how do we treat

15:58.880 --> 16:07.360
each other? How do we allocate kind of, yeah, not just financial rewards, but also, I guess,

16:07.360 --> 16:11.760
empathy to other people because it's not just this works, not just towards those that are

16:11.920 --> 16:17.760
extremely successful. I think we should still congratulate people. So you can congratulate

16:17.760 --> 16:24.640
me with my book. I will take the congratulations. I can congratulate you with your show. I still,

16:24.640 --> 16:29.600
all of that is fine because in the end, we do, we do put in an effort and it would be kind of

16:29.600 --> 16:35.440
strange to treat each other as determinist robots. That's not what I'm arguing for,

16:35.440 --> 16:42.480
but I still kind of a bit of modesty would really, I think, change the way we

16:44.560 --> 16:48.560
are generous or not, but also the way we organize society.

16:48.560 --> 16:53.520
Yeah. Well, let's talk about some of the other reasons for that humility in a little bit, but I

16:53.520 --> 16:59.280
want to get to first what I think is your main argument, which is that billionaires and people

16:59.280 --> 17:04.880
who are overdecor millionaires are bad for the rest of society, that this sort of concentration

17:04.960 --> 17:09.680
is a bad thing in and of itself, even if one were to think one deserves it.

17:10.720 --> 17:15.280
It's even if a very deserving billionaire were to exist and we're all to say, yes,

17:15.280 --> 17:19.440
very good job. We have no problems with how you did it and with you having this money,

17:19.440 --> 17:22.320
that would still be bad. And tell me why you think that is.

17:22.320 --> 17:28.560
Yeah. So I think the case of how well concentration undermines democracy,

17:28.560 --> 17:32.320
so the principle of political equality is the clearest and especially in the US.

17:33.040 --> 17:40.160
I mean, American political scientists have written papers and books where they argue that

17:40.160 --> 17:46.720
the US is actually no longer a democracy, but an oligarchy or plutocracy because of the way

17:46.720 --> 17:52.080
money influences politics. And money can influence politics in different ways.

17:52.720 --> 17:57.360
The most obvious is donations, donations to political parties or to candidates.

17:57.920 --> 18:03.440
And I mean, that is, I think, a significant difference between the US and Europe because

18:03.440 --> 18:09.600
we have quite strict rulings on how much you can donate to a political candidate.

18:09.600 --> 18:17.440
Actually, in my country, in the Netherlands, the last government made that rule even more

18:17.440 --> 18:23.360
stricter. They decided that each person can give a maximum of 100,000 euros per person

18:23.360 --> 18:29.200
per year to politics. Of course, those who want to really have a bigger influence on politics

18:29.200 --> 18:33.920
will still try to find a way around, but it's difficult. And also, all the donations to political

18:33.920 --> 18:37.200
parties are in an open register, so everybody can see what happens.

18:38.320 --> 18:45.040
In the US, as you know, much better than I do. I mean, money can really buy politics quite

18:45.840 --> 18:51.680
significantly. And it's also quite difficult to stand for political office if you don't have what

18:51.760 --> 18:59.280
they call a war chest. So that is unfortunately the reality. So that's one... And then what political

18:59.280 --> 19:06.400
scientists have shown is that the policies that follow are really skewed towards the interests

19:06.400 --> 19:12.560
of the rich. And that is the first problem. The second problem is... Or the second mechanism

19:12.560 --> 19:16.720
in which this happens is... Let me just dwell on the first problem a little bit, if that's okay.

19:17.680 --> 19:24.160
That... I think we sort of don't talk enough about what we mean by democracy and political

19:24.160 --> 19:28.320
equality, which is that it's the ability of average people to have a say in how the country

19:28.320 --> 19:35.200
is run and for there to be some level of equality there. And if a small number of people have a

19:35.200 --> 19:41.280
vast amount more power than everybody else, that's a major step back towards a monarchy or

19:41.360 --> 19:47.600
towards a aristocracy where a small number of people are literally running the society that

19:47.600 --> 19:52.800
we live in. And it's one of those things where I was like, oh, I was just brought up being told

19:52.800 --> 19:59.200
that's what the American Revolution was about. That's not American values is for a small number

19:59.200 --> 20:04.000
of people to lord over the rest of us. But that's what inevitably happens when there's too much

20:04.000 --> 20:12.720
concentrated wealth. Yes. And I really think it is... I mean, the book that I wrote, when I

20:12.720 --> 20:17.680
talk about it in continental Europe, I often get the reaction, yeah, yeah, but you know, this is

20:17.680 --> 20:23.120
really an American problem, what you're describing. And it's not true. I mean, I have also lots of

20:24.080 --> 20:28.800
scientific studies that show and also arguments that show that some of the problems are also really

20:28.880 --> 20:34.400
universal problems and they play in Europe too. But the problem about how money translates,

20:34.400 --> 20:40.880
so basically financial power, translating political power, is everywhere. But it's

20:40.880 --> 20:46.560
especially, I think, a problem in the US because the walls that you have to build between the sphere

20:46.560 --> 20:54.240
of money and the sphere of politics in the US are, they're very weak. Yeah. Also because, I mean,

20:54.240 --> 21:00.320
if you say that companies that give money is a form of speech, yeah, then of course, I mean,

21:00.320 --> 21:09.920
what is this kind of reasoning? And that is, I guess, a very specific problem for the US.

21:09.920 --> 21:14.720
It's funny that you mentioned monarchies because I've lived all my life in monarchies,

21:14.720 --> 21:19.920
first in Belgium and then in the Netherlands. But you know, our monarchs have like almost no power.

21:19.920 --> 21:25.440
Yeah. In Belgium, they say that actually the monarch keeps the country together.

21:26.640 --> 21:30.560
That's the main role they play. They're kept in such a little box. I mean,

21:31.520 --> 21:35.600
I knew some people who are a little mad about all the gossip about the British royal family.

21:36.320 --> 21:41.440
And I'm like, that is all they're for at this point. They're just there for everyone else

21:41.440 --> 21:48.640
to gossip about. This is the only purpose. They have no other role. Yeah, they play different

21:48.880 --> 21:53.520
role. They have in any case very little political power. I think the question you asked about what

21:53.520 --> 21:59.040
is democracy really is a fundamental one. So it is not just having the right to vote.

21:59.040 --> 22:05.840
It's also being able to vote. So for example, not having you be hindered from voting. It's also,

22:05.840 --> 22:13.280
I mean, all the other factors that can prevent people from voting, but also political participation.

22:13.280 --> 22:18.320
In the end, the ideal democracy, which will of course, which is an ideal, so we will never be

22:18.400 --> 22:25.760
able to fully reach that is that we govern ourselves together. That means that everybody who wants to

22:25.760 --> 22:31.760
and has an interest has an equal potential influence on society. And we are very far from this.

22:32.320 --> 22:39.040
And the influence of the disproportionate influence of the very rich on politics

22:39.040 --> 22:43.840
is not just directly via politics, but also for example, because of the way they influence the

22:43.840 --> 22:49.520
public sphere. So if you have somebody like Rupert Murdoch, who just kind of buys up first in

22:49.520 --> 22:57.520
Australia, then in the UK and now in the US, who buys up media power and really becomes a very

22:57.520 --> 23:06.320
important factor that shapes the public discourse, then you create, from money, you create power

23:06.320 --> 23:11.440
that is a form of political power. Politics is not just about voting. I mean, this is an open door

23:11.440 --> 23:17.040
we all know this, but we have to then really think like, what are the preconditions for robust

23:17.040 --> 23:24.800
democracy? And I think that having, for example, also public institutions that are outside the sphere

23:24.800 --> 23:31.280
of money, like have education outside, so no, to have basically high quality public education,

23:32.080 --> 23:38.640
high quality public universities, high quality public media, these are all, I think,

23:38.640 --> 23:45.280
very important to get a kind of political ecosystem that protects democracy. And the problem is that

23:45.280 --> 23:50.800
money undermines this. There's a broader vision of democracy that I'm always trying to promote on

23:50.800 --> 23:55.920
this show, which is because the one that we're brought up with is so limited to you vote, you

23:55.920 --> 24:01.440
donate, maybe you protest and hold a sign, that's it. And that's all democracy is. But no, democracy

24:01.440 --> 24:07.840
is having participation in all of how your society is run and making sure that it reflects the will

24:07.840 --> 24:14.160
of all of the people. And that includes things like media or the conditions under which you work

24:14.160 --> 24:19.600
or the town that you live in. So if a billionaire is so powerful that they can buy an entire

24:19.600 --> 24:23.680
communications media and start bending it to their will, like Elon Musk did with Twitter,

24:23.680 --> 24:30.640
or if a billionaire is so powerful that they can buy your entire town and control the

24:32.400 --> 24:36.880
buildings that you live in, like, I forget the name of the guy, but the Warren Buffett's partner,

24:36.880 --> 24:42.800
who's a billionaire, you know, designed his own dorm room for like a thousand students in, I believe

24:42.800 --> 24:47.680
UC Berkeley, that's like a horrible jail. But he was able to do it because he had so much money,

24:47.680 --> 24:51.280
he could donate and donate it and say, build a building like this, because it's my idea and

24:51.280 --> 24:54.240
they're doing it. And it's going to be horrible. Everyone who lives there is going to be miserable.

24:54.240 --> 24:59.600
But the only reason it happened is because this man had so much power, that kind of power over

24:59.600 --> 25:05.120
the world, the rest of us live in is undemocratic, even when it doesn't touch our political system

25:05.120 --> 25:10.880
properly conceived, you know, narrowly conceived. It's, it's, we don't want to live in a society

25:10.880 --> 25:15.840
where one or two people are able to control the rest of us like that. That's not the fucking

25:15.840 --> 25:21.520
point of this. Yeah. And there's actually two things that make it even worse. One is that once,

25:22.640 --> 25:30.880
so often, the super rich, the multimillionaires, they also kind of, they used politics, then

25:30.880 --> 25:38.720
basically politicians for their own purposes. So they, I mean, they, so Abigail Disney made

25:38.720 --> 25:47.360
a film about her, her, the company of her, her grandfather. And she talks about the Disney

25:47.360 --> 25:54.560
Park in, in, in California. In Anaheim. Yes, exactly. I was, I was trying to find a word.

25:54.560 --> 25:58.240
Thanks for having me. I'm an expert in Southern California geography. If I have any questions

25:58.240 --> 26:03.680
for you about Utrecht, you'll let me know. Yes, that's a good, that's a deal. So,

26:05.040 --> 26:10.080
so she, and the movie is actually very, so it's a documentary, and it's very revealing because

26:10.080 --> 26:16.080
it doesn't, it really shows how like they, they also, because they become so important and so

26:16.080 --> 26:22.560
influential, the local government also just starts to do stuff for the company that makes

26:22.560 --> 26:28.560
it even richer. Yes. And this mechanism where really you see the, I mean, I described in the book

26:28.560 --> 26:32.960
a couple of really, really bad cases, like the kleptocrats, which we have in, I mean,

26:32.960 --> 26:36.800
Putin is a good example, Berlusconi in Italy was a good example we had,

26:37.920 --> 26:43.600
but you have them everywhere. And, and so it becomes really bad at all levels. So that's an

26:43.600 --> 26:50.000
additional problem. But another problem is that the super rich, the billionaires, also no longer

26:50.000 --> 26:55.840
become so rich that they kind of almost no longer need democracy. So we ordinary folks,

26:55.840 --> 27:00.720
we need each other, we need each other to survive, to have good lives. But if you look at what people

27:00.720 --> 27:07.200
like Peter Thiel does, so I don't know whether how much this has been discussed in the US, but

27:07.200 --> 27:14.880
and I'm sure I don't know all the details myself, but he took on additional citizenship in New

27:14.960 --> 27:21.600
Zealand, which is very, very difficult to get. The reason he could get it was because of some

27:21.600 --> 27:28.080
contributions to the to the economy of New Zealand. And then he needed that because he wanted to buy

27:28.080 --> 27:34.960
some unsupported lands. And that lands, which is close to a lake that is actually sacred for the

27:34.960 --> 27:41.120
local indigenous people, the Maori, he can go there and live there with his friends when the

27:41.120 --> 27:46.880
apocalypse hits US. And then you also, of course, have the super rich with their bunkers. So they

27:46.880 --> 27:52.960
have all these strategies, I mean, Musk going to space is another example, rather than trying to fix

27:52.960 --> 27:58.880
the problems that we have collectively on this planet. Yes, they have these escape fantasies.

27:58.880 --> 28:03.520
But some of them, it's not just fantasies. I mean, if you, if you, if you have a private

28:03.520 --> 28:09.440
jet or you have multiple private jets, and you just have bought a really nice piece of land in

28:09.440 --> 28:14.640
New Zealand, and you just say, okay, when shit hits the fan, I just take my friends and we fly

28:14.640 --> 28:20.560
there. Yeah. Well, this is a fantasy that so many people have. I think it's not just a fantasy of

28:20.560 --> 28:25.600
the wealthy. The average people have the fantasy of I want a little compound out in the middle

28:25.600 --> 28:31.040
of nowhere. I want to just, you know, have some goats and, you know, not need anyone and have a

28:31.040 --> 28:35.920
safe place for me and my polycule or whatever it is, people want to, you know, get together.

28:36.880 --> 28:41.920
But, you know, I think for average people, well, we can't really do it because we're so dependent

28:41.920 --> 28:47.120
on others. Ultimately, at the end of the day, billionaires are able to live in the fantasy

28:47.120 --> 28:53.280
world where their dependency on others is so abstracted away from them is so small, you know.

28:53.280 --> 28:59.200
They don't see the, you know, Amazon factory workers, you know, making minimum wage, 12-hour

28:59.200 --> 29:03.920
days, you know, peeing in bottles that they are actually dependent on for their wealth.

29:03.920 --> 29:09.440
They have the ideology they did it themselves and that, you know, they can go sequester themselves

29:09.440 --> 29:16.080
separately away from everyone. I'd like to get into the economic argument. What is bad about

29:16.640 --> 29:21.920
having a small number of people with incredible concentrations of wealth for the economy and

29:21.920 --> 29:29.040
for, you know, everyone else's earnings? Yes. So I actually don't, in my book, I don't spend a lot

29:29.040 --> 29:35.280
of time talking about the economic argument because as a, as a philosopher, for me, the economy

29:35.280 --> 29:40.400
is a means to enhance. And the answer is the things that are valuable. It is our well-being,

29:40.400 --> 29:45.840
our flourishing, our freedoms, our possibility to shape the life, how we want it to have.

29:45.840 --> 29:51.600
So the economy is a means to that. Still, I understand that you want to have a flourishing

29:51.600 --> 29:56.880
economy because it really helps us to have these good lives. And so many people are actually

29:56.880 --> 30:04.720
primarily moved by the economic arguments for limiting inequality. And the argument is that

30:04.720 --> 30:12.400
increasingly the, the rhetorics that we've been told since the 80s, namely that if you allow

30:12.400 --> 30:18.240
the rich to become as rich as they can and inequality is like a price to pay for them

30:18.240 --> 30:24.880
becoming so rich, everybody will benefit. So that's trickle-down theory. Trickle-down theory is just

30:24.880 --> 30:31.200
a piece of, a piece of theory. It's actually proven not to be true. Has that ever happened? I don't

30:31.200 --> 30:38.720
think so. No, so the Australian economist, John Quiggin has a really nice term for this.

30:38.720 --> 30:45.520
He calls them, he has written a book called Zombie Economics. And so basically he says

30:45.520 --> 30:49.760
there's a couple of ideas. Actually, they're dead, but once in a while they keep coming back.

30:49.760 --> 30:54.880
And of course, with trickle-down economics, we've seen in the UK that this trust,

30:54.880 --> 31:00.640
who was the prime minister for what, like 80 days, that she really believed in trickle-down

31:00.640 --> 31:08.400
economics. Trickle-down economics is kind of a, it's like a pretext to be able to let the rich

31:08.400 --> 31:14.800
pay fewer taxes because we see that this doesn't work. If you want to grow the economy, you need

31:14.800 --> 31:22.000
to invest in the human capital of everybody. That means make sure people are healthy, that the

31:22.000 --> 31:28.960
communities are safe, and that they have good education and decent housing. And then you really

31:28.960 --> 31:34.880
release the potential of people. And then of course, you need not too much bureaucracy and all that

31:34.880 --> 31:40.640
kind of stuff. And that is, so that means that if you reduce inequality, it actually has a positive

31:40.640 --> 31:47.280
effect on economic growth. And the opposite, so the idea that inequality is kind of the price to

31:47.280 --> 31:55.360
pay for overall more economic growth, was the view that neoliberal economists have been pushing in

31:55.360 --> 32:04.240
the 70s and the 80s. And that was standard, standardly believed to be true until, I don't know the

32:04.240 --> 32:11.840
exact year, but at some point, some years ago, even the IMF, which is seen as the headquarters of

32:12.560 --> 32:17.280
this kind of neoliberal thinking, at some point said, no, inequality can really become too big.

32:17.280 --> 32:22.880
And then it just, independent of all the other factors, it hurts the economy. So there's even

32:22.880 --> 32:27.600
no longer even a business case for inequality. There is however a case for those that are super

32:27.600 --> 32:31.680
rich, because they can still become more richer and richer and richer.

32:31.760 --> 32:37.440
Right. They can say, oh, it's working great for me. We can say, hey, we've been trying your strategy

32:37.440 --> 32:42.960
of inequality fueling the economy for the past 50 years at least, doesn't seem like it's going

32:42.960 --> 32:47.680
that great, right? Nobody thinks the world economy is in very healthy shape right now, nor has it

32:47.680 --> 32:53.200
has, nor has it been since the 90s, I would say, that people were like, oh, things are going great.

32:54.320 --> 32:59.760
And inequality has skyrocketed. It seems like these two things have gone together. And that,

33:00.240 --> 33:04.640
might be time to try something new in terms of macroeconomics.

33:04.640 --> 33:12.160
So I really think the problem is that we, and then when I say we, I mean ordinary folks,

33:12.160 --> 33:19.920
we like not to talk about economics. We think economics is complicated. We think it's boring.

33:19.920 --> 33:25.440
So we leave all of that to other people. And then of course, when politicians tell us something

33:25.440 --> 33:30.960
about the economy, yeah, we have no idea what, so we basically believe them because they have

33:30.960 --> 33:35.680
beautiful eyes or because we think they're a guy with whom we cannot go and have a beer at the

33:35.680 --> 33:44.480
barbecue. You mean listen to the economists because they have beautiful eyes? I don't know what the

33:44.480 --> 33:51.440
reason is, but I think we have, we should really empower ourselves in terms of economic literacy

33:51.440 --> 33:57.440
so that we are able to really question what politicians are telling us when they propose

33:57.440 --> 34:02.160
economic policies. Well, I've heard this argument and I actually would really like to get someone

34:02.160 --> 34:07.600
on the show to dive into it. The argument that economics has been treated as perhaps too hard

34:07.600 --> 34:12.960
of a science for the past few decades and that politicians will tend to listen to economists.

34:12.960 --> 34:16.160
The economist says, blah, blah, blah. And so, oh, well, the economist said it. We must do it

34:16.160 --> 34:22.160
without realizing that economics is a very interpretive field, that there's a lot of

34:22.160 --> 34:29.040
ideology in it, and that we've been listening to a field that's been dominated by a certain

34:29.040 --> 34:34.880
ideology of economics for a very long time without really questioning it, which is not the case in

34:34.880 --> 34:42.480
sciences such as physics, climatology, et cetera. These are sciences that have a lot more objective

34:42.480 --> 34:47.520
reality to it, but economics is a social science. And it's as though we were all listening to Freudian

34:47.520 --> 34:52.000
psychoanalysts as though they were telling us the truth. Well, there's a lot of truth in it,

34:52.000 --> 34:56.080
but we know that that's one school among many, and that's sort of the same thing that's happened

34:56.080 --> 35:02.240
with economics. Yeah, no, that's absolutely true. Yeah, so basically, you hit the nail. Yeah, that's

35:02.240 --> 35:09.920
just true. But I should also say, I think the politicians, when they talk about economics,

35:10.000 --> 35:14.720
they really cherry pick what they like. And they also cherry pick, of course, the economists they

35:14.720 --> 35:22.080
will put into their advisors, because economists, although I also really have a lot of criticism

35:22.080 --> 35:28.320
on economics as an academic discipline, I also think, for example, economists have been arguing

35:28.320 --> 35:35.440
for pricing the damage we do to the environment for as long as I can remember. I remember when I

35:35.440 --> 35:42.000
was an economic student, and that's like more than 30 years ago, that we had a professor already

35:42.000 --> 35:49.200
having a whole team of researchers talking about what economists then call internalizing

35:49.200 --> 35:53.920
the negative externalities into the price. So basically, how can you make sure that if somebody

35:53.920 --> 35:59.920
sells a product, that the harm to the environment is actually factored into the price so that

35:59.920 --> 36:04.720
they will sell less and that there will be some compensation. And there you just see that we

36:04.720 --> 36:11.760
are still ruining the environment. So I think it's a mixed thing about how much we should blame

36:11.760 --> 36:18.080
economists as a profession. But I do think it's definitely the case that they have become very,

36:19.680 --> 36:27.040
yeah, they've weeded out all the heterodox, what we tend to call heterodox schools. And they've also,

36:27.040 --> 36:31.680
and then I'm talking really as somebody who first studied economics and then studied philosophy,

36:31.680 --> 36:39.120
they have tried to pretend to be like physics. Some economic methodologies call this the physics

36:39.120 --> 36:48.720
envy among economists. And there's papers written about this. But economics, because it's about

36:48.720 --> 36:54.480
society ultimately, is also about what we owe to each other. And that is the core of

36:54.480 --> 37:01.600
ethics and political philosophy. So you can't separate economics from normative questions,

37:01.600 --> 37:08.160
what is good, what is desirable, what is better. And that for me is really where I like to make a

37:08.160 --> 37:14.720
contribution. And economics is built on, it's a human thing, right? Money is something that humans

37:14.720 --> 37:22.240
invented, right? I love the writer, Yvonne O'Hurrari, who I don't always agree with,

37:22.320 --> 37:27.120
but has a wonderful argument about poverty is imaginary. We made it up. It's not a feature of

37:27.120 --> 37:31.520
the natural universe. It's a human thing that we created that some people have a lot of money and

37:31.520 --> 37:35.920
some people don't. And people tomorrow could decide to do something different and different rules

37:35.920 --> 37:39.840
would apply. And that's a fundamental way that economics is different from physics, because

37:39.840 --> 37:45.280
the same is not true. But this is, here, you're talking about poverty. I mean, this is really a

37:45.280 --> 37:51.360
very, very interesting example of how economics is not just economics, but also economic policy

37:51.360 --> 37:57.280
judgments are ideological, because one of the arguments that have been made in favor of capitalism

37:57.280 --> 38:02.480
in the form that we have it is look at what capitalism did with the global poor. The number

38:02.480 --> 38:08.640
of people living in absolute poverty has really plummeted. And it's true. And then people looking

38:08.640 --> 38:13.600
at those data will say, yeah, capitalism, no other system has ever done this. So capitalism is the

38:13.600 --> 38:18.880
best system we have for the poor. And that's where their argument ends. And then basically,

38:18.880 --> 38:24.080
we have to start to ask questions. What is that poverty line? It turns out that poverty line is

38:24.080 --> 38:32.960
$2.2 per chasing power parity per day. That means what you can buy with $2.2 in the US per day.

38:33.680 --> 38:41.600
It's not what you can buy with $2.2 in Antananarivo or a Kabul or wherever. So that means that line

38:41.600 --> 38:46.160
is way too low. So you should have, like, say $11. And then you still see that there are still many,

38:46.160 --> 38:50.960
many people in poverty. But I think the much more fundamental question that economists

38:50.960 --> 38:57.040
and politicians should ask themselves is, all right, it's true. The number of people that live

38:57.040 --> 39:05.440
in absolute poverty has become much, much smaller. But what had been alternative scenarios that would

39:05.440 --> 39:10.480
also have been economically feasible? And are there scenarios in which that number would have

39:10.480 --> 39:17.520
gone down much more? And I think the answer is yes. Because if you look at what we created,

39:17.520 --> 39:23.440
all of us together with the global economy over the last couple of decades, and if you look at

39:23.440 --> 39:28.560
the absolute shares that went to the global north and then mainly to shareholders in the

39:28.560 --> 39:34.960
global north and what went to the garment workers in the global south, we've given them breadcrumbs.

39:35.760 --> 39:41.760
We have taken really the vast share for ourselves. And that means that everything in the end is also

39:41.760 --> 39:48.160
a question about how do you distribute what you produce together. And that means that

39:50.560 --> 39:55.520
it's true that poverty is in that sense, well, imaginary, I think, I don't know what

39:55.520 --> 40:01.760
I would use that word, but it is to some extent what we choose, because we could have chosen for

40:01.840 --> 40:08.480
a different division of the economic gains in which we would have much fewer people in poverty.

40:08.480 --> 40:14.000
So people say, hey, look at this, a whole lot of people used to make $1 a day. Now they make $2

40:14.000 --> 40:20.320
a day. Capitalism is a big success. They don't point out that a bunch of other people who used to,

40:20.320 --> 40:26.400
I don't know, make $1 million, now make $10 million. And that's where most of the gains went.

40:26.400 --> 40:30.880
And like, well, hey, those people who make $2 now, they could have had five or 10 or 20

40:30.960 --> 40:36.240
under a different system. You're ignoring the fact that we still have kept most of it for ourselves.

43:52.800 --> 43:56.240
I think though that we've gone too deep in this interview without getting to the most radical

43:56.240 --> 44:01.920
party or argument because we've set the stage for it. As a result of all this, you argue that we

44:01.920 --> 44:08.240
literally should not allow the ultra wealthy to be so wealthy that we should put a cap on the amount

44:08.240 --> 44:12.720
that people can. Is it earn or is it the amount of wealth that they can have? What is it?

44:12.720 --> 44:19.200
It's half its wealth. So it's what we have. But let me just give you a bit of context.

44:20.080 --> 44:26.720
So I say that we should strive to have a world so it's an ideal. It's not something we're going

44:26.720 --> 44:33.760
to implement like tomorrow. I say that we should strive to have a world in which nobody is super

44:33.760 --> 44:41.760
rich. And I propose two caps. And one is the higher is what you could call the political

44:41.760 --> 44:47.600
or the institutional. And we should reorganize society and the economy in such a way that we

44:47.600 --> 44:52.320
keep inequality within bounds. Now then obviously the question is where do you put that cap?

44:53.200 --> 44:59.280
And the exact answer should be something like it should be at a level where the damages

44:59.280 --> 45:05.360
to the political system and to the environment of the super wealthy are minimized, but there's

45:05.360 --> 45:12.080
still enough room to let people who are motivated by financial gain do their thing. So those who

45:12.080 --> 45:16.080
really only will work because they want to become rich, they should have enough space.

45:16.800 --> 45:22.640
And then that's basically the tradeoff that you try to make. We got to let those sickos cook.

45:23.600 --> 45:28.400
They're so motivated by money. There's people who are born like that every day. We got to give them

45:28.400 --> 45:33.280
something to do or they're going to go nuts. Yes, but the question is, so some people say to me,

45:33.280 --> 45:38.640
oh, but actually there was a book review in The Economist that says, no, this is crazy because

45:38.640 --> 45:43.760
if people do not know that they could become super, super, super rich, they will no longer become

45:43.760 --> 45:50.400
entrepreneurs. And then my answer is, how? Why do you think this is the case? There's no evidence.

45:50.400 --> 45:56.000
So I think if people could become very well off, they could become really rich, but not extremely

45:56.000 --> 46:02.800
rich. I think they would still try to be successful entrepreneurs. So I think this is again a kind

46:02.800 --> 46:09.920
of almost an exchange of rhetorics. But what you should then do is to organize society in such a

46:09.920 --> 46:18.960
way that, of course, the taxation would be much more progressive, that there would be taxation on

46:18.960 --> 46:26.480
capital gains and on income from entrepreneurship at the same level as on income from labor,

46:26.480 --> 46:32.320
which we don't have now because now we tax labor much more than we tax capital.

46:36.640 --> 46:43.280
And then if you ask what would be the number, I think it would also depend on how society looks

46:43.280 --> 46:52.160
like. So the more you have in a society, public goods, a decent health care system, public education

46:52.160 --> 46:58.640
and so forth, things outside of the sphere of the market and profit making capitalism,

46:59.280 --> 47:06.640
the more you have those things, the lower that level can be. So I suggest, but this is really

47:06.640 --> 47:13.040
like a ballpark figure and as a start for the debate on this, that in a country such as the one

47:13.040 --> 47:18.800
as where I live, the Netherlands, where we do have a public pension system, all of us are entitled

47:18.800 --> 47:24.240
to public pension, which is roughly around the poverty line. And then we try to save for having

47:24.240 --> 47:31.360
additional pension. And we have high quality public education. And we have a health care system for

47:31.360 --> 47:37.520
all, which is it's like not like the British system, which is completely public, it's a regulated

47:38.320 --> 47:46.400
more mixed system. I say for a society like this, 10 million. I know in the US people would say 10

47:46.400 --> 47:52.240
million, 10 million. That's not enough. I can't even, I can't even send my kid to private school

47:52.240 --> 47:57.600
and like fuel my private jet for 10 million. Exactly, you know, we don't need private school.

48:00.400 --> 48:04.480
So that is the thing, of course, that you could say, well, I mean, I don't mind if people say,

48:04.480 --> 48:09.840
well, you know, in the US, perhaps in current circumstances, make it, I don't know, 20 or 50

48:09.840 --> 48:16.400
or even if you want 100 million, but definitely not a billion. You don't need a billion. Nobody

48:16.400 --> 48:21.600
needs a billion. So I think the idea that that you hear in American politics that we shouldn't

48:21.600 --> 48:27.120
have any billionaires is just not ambitious enough. So that is the political limit. Wow.

48:28.160 --> 48:32.080
And then there is a second limit, which is really just the answer to the question,

48:32.080 --> 48:39.200
how much do I as an individual need? Yeah. And there I did some research together with

48:39.200 --> 48:47.040
colleagues from economic sociology, and we asked representative survey, a sample of Dutch people

48:47.040 --> 48:53.600
where they say, so we gave them descriptions of the material quality of life of imaginary families,

48:53.600 --> 49:00.080
and we asked to give them a label. Is this person poor, reasonably well off, well off, very well

49:00.080 --> 49:08.320
off, rich, so rich, nobody, the phrasing was, nobody needs so much money, this is too much.

49:09.120 --> 49:16.480
And then so we increasingly made the descriptions more affluent, and we were able then to make an

49:16.480 --> 49:23.440
estimate of where the Dutch would draw that line. And for a family of two parents, two children,

49:24.320 --> 49:34.320
data for 2018, so that's pre-inflation, we found that they said that around 2.2 million euros,

49:34.320 --> 49:38.720
people say, okay, now it's enough for this family. So I think I therefore say in the book,

49:38.720 --> 49:43.680
I think if you have as an individual, if you have one million in a country such as the Netherlands,

49:43.680 --> 49:50.320
I have to repeat this, you have enough. And I should say, I often give lectures to citizens

49:50.320 --> 49:56.720
where I'm in a debate. And then I'm sometimes challenged that somebody says, but why a million,

49:56.720 --> 50:02.720
why not much, isn't that too low? And then I just ask people in the room, okay, who here in this

50:02.720 --> 50:08.720
room has less than a million and still feels they have everything they need, and then all those hands

50:08.720 --> 50:14.560
go up. I just think we don't need, I mean, also you should know, if you just look at the data,

50:14.560 --> 50:21.520
the vast majority of people do not have so much money. So it is just this fixation with always

50:21.520 --> 50:26.800
having more and more and more that has become this almost like ideological thing that has spread

50:26.800 --> 50:32.800
throughout the world. And I think we should get that back into the bottle. The argument that

50:32.800 --> 50:37.680
you're making, I'm imagining you arguing with a billionaire, right, who says, well, hold on a

50:37.680 --> 50:43.680
second, you can't do this, I need this money. And then you're like, okay, who here is happy

50:43.760 --> 50:47.760
with their, you know, much less than a billion dollars and thinks they have everything that they

50:47.760 --> 50:52.560
need in the world. And 99% of the hands go up. And then you go back to this billionaire, okay,

50:52.560 --> 50:58.640
why do you need the money? Like, what do you, what do you need it for? Like, what is it, what is it

50:58.640 --> 51:06.160
for other than, you know, building monuments to yourself, you know, donating to your favorite

51:06.160 --> 51:10.080
causes. Okay, that's fine. But everyone has a favorite cause. Why should you get to choose

51:10.080 --> 51:14.080
your favorite cause versus anybody else? It's a status and a power thing. It's really status and

51:14.080 --> 51:20.000
power. And that is really where I think, okay, status and power, there are many, there are

51:20.000 --> 51:26.640
different ways in which we can try to acquire status and power. But the problem with money is that if

51:26.640 --> 51:31.120
money becomes a thing by which you try to acquire status and power, it harms the rest of us.

51:32.160 --> 51:37.760
Because of the reasons we discussed and also because it deprives money to the government

51:37.760 --> 51:42.880
who needs that money to alleviate poverty, to build roads and all that other stuff.

51:43.440 --> 51:47.840
You can also have, you can also have status and power with 10 million dollars. You don't

51:47.840 --> 51:53.200
need a billion dollars to do it. I agree. I agree. Like, you know, I'm lucky enough that

51:53.200 --> 51:58.480
I've been able to donate to a local politician who I care about well enough that I get to go to a

51:58.480 --> 52:02.320
little event and shake their hand, you know, and they say thank you. That makes me feel good and

52:02.320 --> 52:06.560
also it's someone I believe in. And it's within, you know, it's like a, it's a legal limit, right?

52:06.560 --> 52:13.120
It's like, it's like 800 dollars here in LA. And you know what? That's, that's plenty. You know what

52:13.120 --> 52:17.280
I mean? Get to feel a little bit special, get to help out. I could donate more than that to a local

52:17.280 --> 52:21.200
nonprofit and then, you know, maybe they put my name in the newsletter or whatever it is.

52:21.920 --> 52:27.120
That's a, that's a healthy version of this dynamic that people want. It's when you,

52:27.680 --> 52:33.680
it's when you inflate it to the, the 100 million or the billion level that it becomes toxic, that,

52:33.680 --> 52:38.720
that no one needs quite that much data. Exactly. So the, the funny thing is that,

52:38.720 --> 52:43.280
that with, with donations and philanthropy. So I have a chapter in the book that's called

52:46.160 --> 52:51.760
now I forgot the title. It's something like, oh yes, it is philanthropy is not the solution.

52:51.760 --> 52:58.320
That's the title of that chapter. And, and the problem. And so basically it, the, there's something

52:58.320 --> 53:03.520
paradoxical almost that I do in that chapter, because on the one hand I argue that I think

53:03.600 --> 53:08.240
all of us should really consider whether we may have too much because we have, for example,

53:09.520 --> 53:14.560
I mean, say upper middle class people who just were lucky in the, what, because their houses,

53:15.200 --> 53:21.520
they bought the house in say the nineties for just very little money. And then the housing,

53:21.520 --> 53:26.880
there was a boom in housing prices and now they're old and they're sitting on this house that is

53:26.880 --> 53:33.360
worth more than a million. Well, I think should they give a million to their kids? I'm not sure.

53:34.240 --> 53:40.720
Um, so, um, and, or there couldn't be other reasons. So I think the question, do I have,

53:40.720 --> 53:45.680
can I give more is a question that I think many more people can ask themselves and only those

53:45.680 --> 53:50.640
that have more than, than a million or 10 million. Yeah. So that is where I think actually giving is

53:50.640 --> 53:57.840
a good thing. But the problem is, uh, when the giving comes with power, then it's problematic.

53:57.920 --> 54:03.840
So I think small money donations, small money philanthropy, what everybody can do is very good

54:03.840 --> 54:10.720
because it doesn't have any power. But as soon as the donations really entail a form of power,

54:11.520 --> 54:16.960
or are really wasteful, um, and actually sometimes philanthropy, I mean, you've had an,

54:16.960 --> 54:22.800
an, uh, a whole, uh, episode on this, but philanthropy is also a way to really, uh,

54:22.800 --> 54:26.960
engage in tax avoidance and tax evasion. So there, there's also really dirty forms of

54:26.960 --> 54:30.640
philanthropy. Uh, that's what you should try to avoid. Power hoarding. People,

54:30.640 --> 54:36.240
people build power for themselves via philanthropy, uh, you know, through family foundations. Uh,

54:36.240 --> 54:38.960
you can't donate the money to your kids without paying a lot of taxes. Instead,

54:38.960 --> 54:43.200
you create a foundation and give that to your kids. And now your kids wield political power

54:43.200 --> 54:48.240
because they're distributing billions of dollars or, or millions of dollars for the rest of their

54:48.240 --> 54:52.480
lives. The, um, the, the Patagonia founder did this to much greater claim. And I made a video

54:52.480 --> 54:56.720
that was very critical of him for essentially hoarding that kind of political power for his

54:56.720 --> 55:03.680
family. Um, I mean, this is such a radical proposal. I'm, I'm curious, and I love that you say

55:03.680 --> 55:09.600
the American call that only the far left has in the United States to ban billionaires, right?

55:09.600 --> 55:14.960
You'll hear Bernie Sanders, who's on the left of our acceptable, you know, political Overton

55:14.960 --> 55:18.800
window, um, in American politics. We'll say there should be no such thing as billionaires,

55:18.800 --> 55:22.080
a couple other people as well. That's already a fringe position. You say that doesn't even go

55:22.080 --> 55:28.560
far enough and that we need to ban 100 millionaires, sent to millionaires. Um, yes. So what would

55:28.560 --> 55:35.600
society look like? Were we to do so? Can you paint us a little bit of a picture of, you know,

55:35.600 --> 55:41.040
it's, it's almost like an Ursula K. Le Guin novel. Like what is this? What is this fantastical world

55:41.040 --> 55:45.760
that you're describing? But I'd love to hear a little bit about it. Yeah. So I mean, I, I really

55:45.760 --> 55:50.640
think that should be the next book, right? And it's also the last chapter I say, okay, what does this

55:50.640 --> 55:56.560
now demand? It demands a different way of organizing the society. I don't know exactly

55:56.560 --> 56:02.720
how this would look like, but what I think we should do is, um, to, so we had in the, in the

56:02.720 --> 56:10.320
post-war years, so the fifties and the sixties, we had a much better mix of what the government did

56:10.320 --> 56:15.600
for us, not just for capital, but for us, for ordinary people. And then the entrepreneurs

56:15.600 --> 56:21.600
that also saw themselves really much more as stewards towards the communities. And we had,

56:22.480 --> 56:27.280
so we had a mix of different things. And also the, the government actually was much more,

56:27.280 --> 56:32.400
a much more important force for innovation. The self governments in those years were very

56:32.400 --> 56:36.960
important for innovations that actually are now part of what makes the billionaires billionaires.

56:36.960 --> 56:42.960
So there's something deeply ironic there. And that economy, which I, when I studied economics,

56:42.960 --> 56:47.520
was told is called the mixed economy. I think we should have the mixed economy,

56:47.520 --> 56:52.800
but we will have it with all the technological advances that we currently have. So basically,

56:52.800 --> 56:58.160
it's really, uh, and then it should, of course, be in a way that keeps also the economy and the

56:58.160 --> 57:04.000
way we produce stuff within planetary boundaries. Now, if you ask me what, how does it look like?

57:04.000 --> 57:09.200
There are people who are doing research on this. So for example, in the UK, you have, um, Kate

57:09.200 --> 57:14.720
Rayward, who's argued for the donut economy, donut in the, which is the metaphor for you

57:14.720 --> 57:20.240
stay within the planetary boundaries. You don't, um, what we are currently doing, we're basically,

57:21.440 --> 57:27.200
overusing the planet. It's not, we're going to be to the same degree habitable for our children

57:27.200 --> 57:32.720
and grandchildren. And you also try to make sure that everybody has their minimum social needs met.

57:33.440 --> 57:41.840
And, uh, I think such a world is possible, but it requires, I guess it requires not just, uh,

57:41.840 --> 57:46.240
much better international cooperation, but also really a different ideology.

57:47.520 --> 57:54.320
I think the, the, the, the feasibility problem in terms of, say, getting it organized is not

57:54.320 --> 57:59.840
a question. The question is, do we want this? Yeah. And, and there, I think the U S really is

57:59.840 --> 58:06.800
again in a, in a very particular position because, uh, not only because the ideology of, I mean,

58:06.800 --> 58:11.760
what we tend to call the neoliberal ideology is so much stronger in the U S than it is, for example,

58:11.760 --> 58:20.080
in, in, uh, continental Europe, but also because the U S is so, so rich. So I'll just give you one.

58:20.080 --> 58:25.920
So there is an online publication, the global wealth report, which has zillions of data that

58:25.920 --> 58:30.720
where you can learn everything about wealth distribution. But let me just give you one,

58:30.720 --> 58:38.640
one statistic, which is what is the share of wealth, total wealth that, that the U S has

58:38.640 --> 58:44.320
of all the wealth that is in the world. So we know that America has about 4.2% of the global

58:44.320 --> 58:52.080
population. So if, if America had as much as other countries, it would have 4.2% of wealth.

58:52.160 --> 58:55.840
Yeah. How much do we actually have? I'm afraid to hear the number.

58:56.480 --> 59:05.360
30.8%. 30.8%. Yes. So, and also if you look at all the other statistics in that report, like

59:05.360 --> 59:11.360
the number of ultra wealth, what, what financial people call ultra wealth, ultra wealthy people

59:11.360 --> 59:18.000
and the number of billionaires, all that money, the most of the money really in the world is in

59:18.000 --> 59:23.840
the U S. I mean, I, yes, it's true. China is growing. You have billionaires in all countries.

59:24.720 --> 59:29.520
And that means that if you get, if you get, if somehow, and this is really the big question,

59:29.520 --> 59:37.120
how, if we were able to get this change in the U S, then the other countries can follow.

59:37.120 --> 59:39.920
But I think if, if we can't, yeah, so I think really.

59:39.920 --> 59:43.840
And yet, but this is probably the hardest place to make it happen because this is where

59:43.840 --> 59:47.040
we've got all the rich people and they have all the power and they're running the country.

59:47.040 --> 59:52.000
Right. Yeah. And so then, so this is really the question like how to change this. And this is now

59:52.000 --> 01:00:00.240
where the, where the, it's almost so sad that you, that we have to start making jokes about it. But

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:05.520
I think the only solution really is democracy. Yeah. But then, then we're talking about American

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:11.520
democracy, right? Right. Yeah. In the election year. So, but I just think the, the only solution

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:17.840
really is for, to have a mass mobilization and make people understand what's genuine in their

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:24.720
interest and not what they should just believe that politicians are saying. And the problem also,

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:32.320
of course, which scholars have documented in detail is that the, the more you could say leftist

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:40.000
leaders say the Democrats in, in the U S or labor in, in the UK or social democratic parties in,

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:46.320
in continental Europe, they have all really also adopted that neoliberal strategy. They have

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:51.280
led ordinary people down. And that means, of course, that now we have a crisis of democracy.

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:58.160
So we are, we are in a very, very bad situation. So thank goodness we have comedians who make us

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:05.920
laugh once in a while so that we can keep going. Yeah. Gallo's humor is what this show specializes

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:14.800
in as we're on our way to the death of democracy. When you describe this, describe this position

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:22.080
as libertarianism, do you think it's compatible at all with capitalism as an economic system?

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:26.960
Or is it, you know, is this a form of socialism? We don't need to get too deep into the classification

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:32.000
of these things. But I'm curious if you, if you think it's, if it's compatible with capitalism

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:37.680
at all? Yeah. So if the economic system that we had after the world war, so this mixed system of,

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:46.160
of having, I mean, so I think what people would generally label social democracy, if

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:51.920
social democracy is seen as a form of capitalism, which I would say it is a form of capitalism,

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:59.120
but kind of a good form of capitalism, then the answer is yes. A better form. Yeah. Yeah. But

01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:05.040
the thing is that I know we can get stuck into definitions, but if of course the ultimate thing

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:12.640
of capitalism is unconstrained profit seeking, then the answer is no. I mean, I think profit is,

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:17.440
I mean, sort of the defenders of capitalism will say that profit is a force for goods,

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:21.680
because it will make sure that I as an entrepreneur will deliver something that meets the need of

01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:26.960
another person. And I do this because I seek a profit and they get their desires or their needs

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:34.320
met. So that's the magic, but that's the magic of markets. And I think, so the question is just,

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:42.000
can we have this system where we are satisfied with decent profits, good profits, but not boundless

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:47.360
profits? If the answer is yes, then we can have capitalism. If the answer is no, then I don't

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:50.400
know what we're going to have. So some people think we're going to have the pitchforks.

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:56.320
I want you to address someone like Jeff Bezos directly to end the episode,

01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:01.120
because if I'm imagining, I'm going to put myself in his position, right? And what I think he actually

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:08.080
believes. And I think what he believes is, yes, I have amassed great wealth. I have done so by

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:13.680
creating more wealth for everybody else. I created this gigantic company. I grew it. I grew it.

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:18.880
So many people have made so much money from, you know, the people who sell products on my

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:23.760
platform to the guys who drive the trucks, even the warehouse workers, oh, they weren't doing,

01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:26.800
you know, that part of the country, they didn't have that many good jobs and we've given them

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:31.360
jobs and, you know, they've made some money where they couldn't make some before. And the reason I

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:38.160
have so much is because I have been an engine for so many other people getting so much as well.

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:43.040
And so if you stop people like me from existing, everybody will in fact be poorer. I think that's

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:47.040
what they genuinely believe because everyone believes they're a good person and everyone

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:51.840
has a justification for why that's the case. And so if you could sit him down,

01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:57.760
what would you tell him about why he is wrong about that and what would in fact be better?

01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:03.120
Yeah. So I'm serious when I say, if people like Jeff Bezos want to have a chat with me,

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:09.920
they can Google me, they can call me and I talk with everybody. But what I would say to him,

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:17.520
if I were to meet him, is that no money, no wealth is created by, can be created by a person that

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:22.960
by themselves. So I mean, I have in the book this example of take somebody like Jeff Bezos and

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:28.320
some of his friends and put them to an island where which has enough to survive and let's see

01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:33.760
how rich they can become. They cannot become rich. That means all wealth in the virtual world is

01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:40.080
because of collaborations within society. And that means that so that if he says I create these jobs

01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:45.840
for all these people and I produce all these services, the question about distribution cannot

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:52.320
be avoided. You always have to ask, okay, we produce this together. So how much do I take

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:57.280
and how much do I give to the workers to be all the people in the supply chain. And that's where

01:04:57.280 --> 01:05:04.000
it goes wrong. So he basically is giving them as little as he can to still be able to run his

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:09.280
company. And that's really, and that is, and if you then look at what he gives them also the

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:13.920
working conditions, I think it just meets the definition of exploitation. And it's actually

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:20.320
interesting that when his former wife, Mackenzie Scott, when they divorced and she got, I think,

01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:28.560
one fourth, one quarter of his Amazon shares, she wrote this letter on Medium where she said

01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:32.640
something like she announced that she was going to give away all our money. And then she said,

01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:39.280
I do not doubt that the wealth that is in the hands of individuals is actually being created

01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:46.240
by forces that provide countless opportunities for some and our obstacles to others. And I just

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:54.560
think we should stop thinking about, okay, what did I as an individual create? And we should see

01:05:54.560 --> 01:06:00.080
it as, what do we create together? It's almost impossible to do something without others. And

01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:06.320
if you do something with others, the question about how to divide up what you create together

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:12.240
hence the distributive question is just unavoidable. If you do not ask it, it is because you are in a

01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:16.080
power position to dictate to the others what you take and what they will get.

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:24.560
That is a wonderful answer that, it's a flip to look at, oh, I've given these people so many jobs.

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:30.560
How about all those people with those jobs created all of the wealth and you are taking

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:35.200
an outsized portion of it? And in fact, if you did not take so much, they would be even wealthier.

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:36.800
Absolutely.

01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:43.440
Is the question to ask. Well, I love that you're putting those ideas out there. And I know that,

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:47.360
I love that you said, how can we make them happen? And we have to think about it. It seems like an

01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:52.080
obviously very long road, but never doubt the capacity of a book to change the world, right?

01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:58.800
You know, Karl Marx did it, Adam Smith did it, right? And there it is. Yeah, hold it up one more

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:00.080
time for us so we can see.

01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:03.200
Yes, and I actually, I should say something. So here's the book I wrote.

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:11.520
I should say something about the length that ideas can take. So the people who have influenced,

01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:17.200
the thinkers who've influenced the current, our current ideology. So that's Frédéric von Hayek

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:21.920
and Milton Friedman and others, they wrote their books in the, they started to write their books

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:30.720
in the 40s. They seized power around 1980. So we are in there for the long run. This is not

01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:34.880
going to be something that we're going to implement tomorrow. We have to start changing

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:40.320
the ideology because if you change, you can't change policies without changing the way people

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:47.920
see themselves, see society. So I think in this change of, in this, in this sequence of change,

01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:52.240
the first thing that needs to change is the ideas. And that's where we are now.

01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:56.160
And I'm not alone. There are many people who are writing books, producing movies.

01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:57.120
Yes.

01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:01.920
And that's where we need to do the hard work and just not give up.

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:06.560
Well, thank you so much for being on the show. You were absolutely wonderful to talk to. I

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:10.880
couldn't have loved it more. People should pick up a copy of the book. It's called Limiterianism.

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:15.760
You can pick up a copy at our special bookshop, factuallypod.com, slash books. Where else can

01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:17.680
people find it and where can they follow your working grid?

01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:23.280
I would say if you want to buy a book, go to your local bookshop and they can order it for you.

01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:28.960
And if you, I mean, yeah, people can, I have a unique name, my surname and my first name,

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:33.040
Ingrid Robbins. There's only one person in the world. So if you Google me, you can find out what

01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:37.920
I, what I do and what I write. So, and really thanks for having me on the show. It was a great

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:41.760
conversation. You've been so wonderful, Ingrid. Thank you so much. Thank you.

01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:46.960
Well, thank you once again to Ingrid Robbins for coming on the show. If you loved that conversation

01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:51.600
as much as I did, pick up a copy of her book at factuallypod.com, slash books. And a reminder,
