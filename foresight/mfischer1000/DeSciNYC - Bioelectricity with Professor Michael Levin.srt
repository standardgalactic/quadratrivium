1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We're going to start.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Do we sit on the monitor?

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Yeah.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Welcome.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Oh.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Hello.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Hello.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hello.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Hello.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Hello.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Hello.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Oh, there it is working.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Someone's joining.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Test one, two, admit.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Okay.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
There we go.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Okay.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So just leave room over here.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So squeeze in that way to the right.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
To your left.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
To your right.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Sorry.

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
This is the order here.

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Good.

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You guys, come on this place for it.

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This is our room here.

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Please.

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Please space, space.

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Don't be shy.

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Say hello to your neighbor.

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Do you guys want to?

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Anyone else?

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's okay.

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
First off, thank you guys all for coming.

36
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,320
How many of you know why you're here?

37
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,320
How many of you know what decentralized science is at all?

38
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,920
Yes, some people?

39
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,760
There's some people?

40
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,800
Okay, yeah, this is decentralized science

41
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,760
in this vicinity here.

42
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,280
How many of you have been to a Deci NYC event before?

43
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,440
Oh wow, so many people.

44
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,880
We have a lot of return desires.

45
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,200
We're gonna issue a token at some point, which will be cool.

46
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,720
Like a Deci NYC token,

47
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,480
so you can memorialize your being on the blockchain.

48
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,600
Cool, well without further,

49
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,600
let's just do a quick picture.

50
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,520
We'll do a panoramic one.

51
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,120
Oh, someone's, okay, smile, smile, smile.

52
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,320
Smile, smile, smile.

53
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,320
This one's on the Twitter and such.

54
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,160
Okay.

55
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,400
Oh my gosh, I think this might be one of our largest ones.

56
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,720
And let me just do one more.

57
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,920
Okay, so we're gonna do it slightly differently this time.

58
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,600
So Michael Levin is going to speak first.

59
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,400
How many of you have seen Michael Levin

60
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,080
on one of his talks already?

61
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,080
Like when we were, wow, that's a lot of people.

62
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,480
Okay, one more.

63
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,280
When I was promoting this event,

64
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,200
we got a lot of DMs who said he's my favorite speaker.

65
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,640
Can you hear us, Michael?

66
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,480
Yeah, I can.

67
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,320
Okay, good.

68
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,560
He said, this is one of his favorite,

69
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,040
a couple of people messaged me saying

70
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,280
Michael Levin is one of our favorite

71
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,720
tech speakers that they've ever seen.

72
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,440
So that was just totally cool.

73
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,120
Can you see the audience here, Michael?

74
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,960
Yeah, yeah, I can.

75
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,800
80 people, right?

76
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,120
Yeah.

77
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,460
And then, what else did I want to say?

78
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,660
There was one thing, oh yeah.

79
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:22,020
If you guys post us on Twitter or on Instagram,

80
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,740
we'd be forever grateful.

81
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,820
It helps us read the word.

82
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,220
It helps to decentralize science.

83
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,060
It helps to get the word out.

84
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,340
So, I'm gonna let Michael speak.

85
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,540
But I'm just gonna say one thing.

86
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,440
If you like decentralized science,

87
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,500
we started a decentralized science company.

88
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,940
I'll talk more about it in a second,

89
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,460
but I know some people are gonna go.

90
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,660
But I just wanna say, if you're looking for a job,

91
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,980
we're hiring to do a decentralized science platform.

92
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,060
So, if this is interesting to you,

93
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,340
we have an in-person office in New York City.

94
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,940
We're looking to hire community managers,

95
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,420
developers, business people.

96
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,100
We pay really, really well.

97
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,140
And we have a great office and a great team.

98
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,260
And we're looking to grow.

99
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,620
So, if you're interested in this

100
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,540
and you're interested in decentralized science,

101
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,500
maybe you're an angry academic.

102
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,940
Maybe you're looking to change the world.

103
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,500
Maybe you're looking to see something better.

104
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,340
We'll do this.

105
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,740
I just wanted to get that before.

106
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,740
I'll do a little talk on what is decentralized science

107
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,220
after Professor Levin speaks.

108
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,660
So, without further ado,

109
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,300
Professor Levin is a professor at Tufts University,

110
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,220
super renowned in his field for his work on bioelectricity,

111
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,500
which was when I first heard about it.

112
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,540
I was amazed.

113
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,340
And I'll let you take it from here.

114
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,100
Yeah, thanks so much.

115
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,580
Let's give him a round of applause.

116
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:41,580
Thank you so much for the invitation.

117
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,860
And that's a very kind introduction.

118
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,580
And thanks for letting me share some ideas with you.

119
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,420
So, let me, let's see,

120
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:53,020
I'm going to figure out how to share a screen here.

121
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:53,980
All right.

122
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,180
So, I'm going to turn on my slides.

123
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,780
And when I do, I will not be able to see you.

124
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,860
So, if anything goes wrong,

125
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,540
just please somebody speak up, realize.

126
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,180
All right, here we go.

127
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,620
Okay, so what I'd like to talk about today

128
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,260
is the field of diverse intelligence.

129
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,980
And specifically the kind of cognitive processes

130
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,220
that go on in your body

131
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,020
and what this means for various other issues.

132
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,460
You can find all the primary work,

133
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,460
like the primary papers, data sets, software,

134
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,020
everything at this site.

135
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,020
And you can sign up for announcements

136
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:29,580
and get some thoughts beyond what I can say

137
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,940
in peer reviewed publications.

138
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,660
You can get that in my blog here.

139
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,540
So, there's four things I'd like to talk about today.

140
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,900
First of all, I'm going to talk a little bit about

141
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,460
what I mean by diverse or unconventional intelligence.

142
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,820
I will give you some examples of such,

143
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,060
looking at bioelectricity and how it functions

144
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,340
as a kind of cognitive glue that binds the cells

145
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,700
in your body into a kind of collective intelligence.

146
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,140
And this collective intelligence

147
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,740
solves problems in anatomical space,

148
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,620
also known as morpheus space.

149
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,140
I will talk about some biomedical applications

150
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:04,940
that result from thinking in these kinds of ways.

151
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,780
And towards the end,

152
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,980
we're going to touch on some issues about the future

153
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,940
and what I think it means for all of us.

154
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:13,420
So, this is a well-known classic painting.

155
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,740
It's called Adam is Naming the Animals in the Garden of Eden.

156
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,620
And I find this very interesting

157
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,940
because I think there's one profoundly wrong aspect

158
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,260
of this old story.

159
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,900
And also there's one very deep aspect

160
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,180
that I think is really right on the money

161
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,580
that we have to absorb.

162
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,100
The part that I think is wrong here

163
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,780
is that this gives you the idea

164
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:36,060
that these animals are discrete natural kinds, right?

165
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:36,900
You look at this and you say,

166
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,220
okay, I know what all these animals are.

167
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,380
There's a finite discrete set of individual animals

168
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,700
with specific shapes and specific behaviors.

169
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,780
And Adam is actually different than all of them.

170
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,980
He's special.

171
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,100
And so I think those two things

172
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,340
we're going to have to blow up in the next couple of decades.

173
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,380
That will, I think that's going to disappear.

174
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,820
The part that I think that's really deep here

175
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,220
is that in this old biblical story,

176
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,540
it was actually Adam's job to name the animals.

177
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,460
The angels couldn't do it.

178
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,420
God couldn't do it.

179
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,540
Adam was the one who was supposed to name the animals.

180
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,980
And I think that's for two reasons.

181
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:14,260
One is that he's the one that's going to have to live with him.

182
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:18,020
And the other is that in these old kind of mystical traditions,

183
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,500
naming something or knowing the name

184
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,420
of the real name of something

185
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,620
means that you've understood its true nature.

186
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,020
And that understanding is supposed to give you power

187
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,860
over that thing, right?

188
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,980
So knowing the name of something is really deep.

189
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,580
And I think this is important

190
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,300
because we are all going to have to name

191
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,820
in this kind of meaning.

192
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:40,180
We're going to have to name a whole large set of novel beings

193
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,260
that have never been here before

194
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,100
with whom we are going to share our world.

195
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,180
And I think that's really important.

196
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:50,180
So you no doubt have read all kinds of works of philosophy

197
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:55,340
and other more modern, maybe stories

198
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,380
about the difference between humans

199
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,300
and maybe machines and other things.

200
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,180
And what people typically have in mind

201
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,060
when they say those things is this,

202
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,100
kind of this typical adult modern human

203
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,340
that has this like a gentle special glow about them.

204
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,540
But we've known now for a really long time

205
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,340
that both on an evolutionary time scale

206
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,300
and also a developmental time scale,

207
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,580
there is actually a continuum of bodies

208
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,580
and we'll get back to this towards the end of the talk.

209
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,660
But actually if this form has very slowly

210
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,820
and gradually evolved from all these other forms

211
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:31,180
and originally a unicellular microbial ancestor,

212
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,460
then the same thing is true during your lifetime.

213
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:36,820
So whatever properties this kind of being has,

214
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,300
and so memory, true goals, preferences,

215
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:45,300
understanding, moral worth, responsibility, and so on,

216
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,620
we really, as scientists and philosophers,

217
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,860
we really owe some a story about how that arises.

218
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,860
Where in this continuum does that actually show up?

219
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,220
And is it better to think about that

220
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,580
as a kind of discrete thing,

221
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,900
you have it or you don't have it?

222
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:01,140
Or what I think is that it's actually a continuum,

223
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,220
the right question is what kind and how much?

224
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,860
And so I've been working on a framework

225
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:10,260
to enable us to recognize, create,

226
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:14,500
and ethically relate to a really diverse set of intelligences

227
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,620
that are very different from the kinds of things

228
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,460
that we usually recognize as intelligences.

229
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:22,540
So apes, birds, maybe an octopus or a whale or something.

230
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,100
But all kinds of other creatures,

231
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,580
colonial organisms and swarms like beehives

232
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,700
and ant colonies, synthetic biology,

233
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,180
engineered new life forms, AIs,

234
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,380
whether robotic or purely software,

235
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,340
and maybe at some point, aliens,

236
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,580
at some point maybe we find some exobiological life.

237
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,180
So we need to be able to talk

238
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,860
about all of these things simultaneously.

239
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,140
What do they all have in common?

240
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,020
And I'm not the first person to try

241
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,020
for a framework like this.

242
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:52,620
This is 1943, Wiener, Rosenbluth, and Bigelow

243
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,940
tried for a scale that goes all the way from passive matter,

244
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,020
so basically simple passive materials,

245
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:02,020
all the way up through these kinds of different stages

246
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:05,420
to the kind of complex second order metacognition

247
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,500
that humans have where they can think about themselves

248
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,860
and they know that they know things and so on.

249
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,860
So what we need is a story of scaling.

250
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,820
How do very simple information processing kinds

251
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,220
of acts become minds?

252
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,180
And whatever framework that we come up with,

253
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,980
it has to move experimental work forward.

254
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,140
It can't just be philosophy.

255
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,980
It's actually give us new capabilities,

256
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,900
for example, new biomedicine.

257
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,180
And it also has to enhance ethics.

258
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:35,060
It has to enhance our ability to understand our world

259
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:38,580
and relate to it with the appropriate kind of compassion.

260
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:43,580
So the fundamental fact is that all of us take this journey.

261
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,980
We've all made this journey

262
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,780
from what people call just physics.

263
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,340
And I really hate that term, but people use it.

264
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:52,820
As an unfertilized oocyte, you were once,

265
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,820
all of us were once a little blob of chemicals.

266
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,380
And when people look at that blob,

267
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:01,140
they say, okay, well, this is just a physical chemical system.

268
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,380
It obeys the laws of chemistry.

269
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,940
There is no mind here, just a bunch of chemicals.

270
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,860
But at some point, slowly and gradually,

271
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,500
it turns into one of these amazing kinds of creatures

272
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,580
or even something like this.

273
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,660
Here's Rene Descartes, who was fond of saying

274
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:19,660
that he was not a machine and had special properties.

275
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,780
And so that's fine, but we need to really then tell a story

276
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,180
of where does that happen?

277
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,220
And developmental biology offers absolutely no place

278
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,420
where you can draw a bright line and say, okay,

279
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,940
before that it was just a bunch of chemicals

280
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,260
doing the things that chemicals do,

281
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:36,180
but now bang, now it's a real being with a real mind

282
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,660
and preferences and goals and so on.

283
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,780
There is no spot like that in developmental biology.

284
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,300
So we really need to understand the scaling this.

285
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,140
Well, at least, okay, so that's a little,

286
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:50,300
that should be, if you take that on to really understand that,

287
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,140
it should be a little disturbing,

288
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,580
but at least we're a true unified intelligence, right?

289
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,340
We're not like an ant colony,

290
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,540
which people do describe ants and termites

291
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,420
as a kind of collective intelligence,

292
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,660
but we're not like that, right?

293
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,060
Like we are a centralized unified mind,

294
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,900
you know, we have a brain and everything.

295
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,660
Well, Rene Descartes thought so,

296
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,180
and in particular, he was fond of the pineal gland

297
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,860
because there's only one of them in the brain

298
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,700
and he felt that our unified human intelligence

299
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,180
should have one spot in the brain

300
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,740
that isn't duplicated the way that other structures are.

301
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,840
But if he had access to microscopes,

302
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,360
he would have discovered that actually,

303
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,760
there isn't one of anything

304
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,280
because in the pineal gland, this is what it looks like.

305
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,880
There are huge numbers of individual cells.

306
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,440
And if he had really good microscopy

307
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,920
inside each one of those cells, he would see this.

308
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,200
This is what's actually inside.

309
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,120
All of this stuff is inside every cell.

310
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,520
So actually all of us are collective intelligences.

311
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,920
Even we know no less than ant colonies

312
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,600
and beehives and flocks of birds,

313
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,680
we are all made of parts.

314
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,720
And in fact, I think all intelligence

315
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,360
is collective intelligence.

316
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,200
In fact, for us, this is the sort of thing we're made of.

317
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,320
Now, this happens to be a free living organism

318
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,160
known as alachromaria, but it's a single cell.

319
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,360
And you can see the amazing competency

320
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,680
it has at its local scale.

321
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,660
So with respect to single cell events,

322
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,000
it handles all of its anatomical needs,

323
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,040
its metabolic needs, its physiological needs,

324
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,320
no brain, no nervous system, no stem cells,

325
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,520
everything is handled by this amazing little organism.

326
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,800
And we are a large collective of cells

327
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,040
that have enormous competencies in different spaces.

328
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,960
And so if you look at our structure,

329
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,280
not only are we a set of nested dolls

330
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,280
consisting of various chemicals and subcellular components

331
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,840
and then tissues and organs and organisms

332
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,800
and then of course, societies and swarms,

333
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,720
not only structurally are we a collection

334
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,120
of these hierarchical levels,

335
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,800
but actually each of these has its own competency,

336
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,000
its own intelligence, its own problem-solving capacity.

337
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,640
So in other kinds of spaces,

338
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,820
not just in three-dimensional space that we're used to,

339
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,360
such as, for example, when mice run mazes and so on,

340
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,180
but in other spaces, the space of physiological states,

341
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,880
the space of all possible types of gene expression,

342
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,080
the space of all possible anatomical configurations.

343
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,640
In all of these spaces, the different levels

344
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,720
of your body structure are solving problems,

345
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,760
pursuing goals, storing and utilizing memories

346
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,200
and navigating those spaces with great ingenuity.

347
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,480
That amazing architecture,

348
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,420
this multi-scale competency architecture,

349
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,520
which currently our technology and robotics

350
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:36,440
and our typical AIs don't use anything like that.

351
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,720
No reason why we couldn't, but no one's done it yet.

352
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,360
But biology uses this amazing multi-scale architecture

353
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,180
and it allows some truly astounding capabilities

354
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,340
for living forms.

355
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,740
I'm gonna show you a couple of interesting examples.

356
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,740
One of the things that biology can do

357
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,580
is have a kind of, you can almost call it

358
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,380
a kind of beginner's mind concept

359
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,580
where it doesn't really make,

360
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,780
evolution doesn't just make organisms

361
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,900
that are solutions to specific problems.

362
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,980
It actually makes problem-solving machines

363
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,980
that come into the world with massive plasticity

364
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,580
ready to take on novel configurations.

365
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,940
So what you're looking at here is a tadpole.

366
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,180
Here's the mouth, here are the nostrils,

367
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,900
here's the brain, here's the tail,

368
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,100
this thing is the gut.

369
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,700
And what you'll notice here is that,

370
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,500
what's happening here is that there are no eyes

371
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,780
in the primary location where the eyes go,

372
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,740
but there is an eye that we induced on the tail.

373
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,180
And what you see is that these animals,

374
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:35,700
when we built this machine to train these tadpoles

375
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,580
in a visual task, and what you find out

376
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,620
is that they can see perfectly well.

377
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,860
And this eye, which is now located on their tails,

378
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,940
doesn't connect to the brain.

379
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,420
Here's the optic nerve.

380
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,500
Sometimes it connects to the spinal cord like this,

381
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,020
sometimes to nothing at all,

382
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,740
and they do very well in visual assays.

383
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,220
So just think about what this means.

384
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:58,220
For millions of years, this brain was perfectly adapted

385
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,740
to take visual input right here from the eyes next to it.

386
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:05,340
And now you've got this weird itchy patch of tissue

387
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,660
on your back that's providing some sort of electrical signal

388
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,340
onto your spinal cord.

389
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:12,420
Why doesn't it take many rounds

390
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:16,100
of evolutionary adaptation, mutation, selection

391
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:16,940
for this to work?

392
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,420
It works right out of the box, first time you do it.

393
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:22,060
It doesn't require any more evolutionary cycles.

394
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,900
And that's because this kind of creature,

395
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,260
as all of us, has massive plasticity.

396
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,060
There are lots of other interesting features.

397
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,220
For example, these are planaria, these are flatworms.

398
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,620
And what's interesting about these guys

399
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,260
is that they are incredibly regenerative.

400
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,820
So you can cut them into many pieces.

401
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,100
Each piece will regenerate

402
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,300
and become a perfect tiny little worm.

403
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,060
Now, one thing that James McConnell discovered in the 60s

404
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,260
and he got a lot of flak for it,

405
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,860
but he was actually right.

406
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:54,860
We repeated his work using modern automated methods in 2013

407
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,260
and he was completely right that if you train a planarian,

408
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:01,580
for example, to feed on these little bumpy,

409
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,140
at least little bumpy circles,

410
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:06,380
and then you amputate their head, including their brain,

411
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,020
and you get this tail left here.

412
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:08,860
The tail sits there,

413
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,700
doesn't do much of anything for the next eight days,

414
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,580
doesn't have any behavior.

415
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:15,540
But what it does do is it grows back a new brain.

416
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,940
And as it grows back a new brain,

417
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,460
you then can test these animals

418
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,940
and you find out that they've remembered

419
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,500
the original information.

420
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,500
So not only is the anatomy regenerated,

421
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,820
but so are the memories.

422
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,980
And actually, whatever, I mean, presumably,

423
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:30,300
they're stored in a tail somewhere we don't know where,

424
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,460
and kind of distributed throughout the body.

425
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,820
And then they are imprinted onto the new brain

426
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,900
as the brain develops so that they can demonstrate behavior.

427
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,020
So the movement of information through the body, right?

428
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,580
You're seeing here simultaneously

429
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,660
the ability to restore anatomical structure,

430
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,060
so anatomical memories,

431
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,780
but also behavioral memories and these things are linked.

432
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:52,820
And one of the most remarkable examples is this.

433
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,180
These are caterpillars and they have a particular brain

434
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,860
suitable for crawling around

435
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,980
using the soft body architecture

436
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,020
in a two-dimensional world.

437
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,540
And they need to turn into this.

438
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:07,380
This is a flying, hard-body kind of being

439
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,740
that has a completely different life

440
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,820
and it has a different brain because of that.

441
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,740
In order to do this,

442
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,260
it basically destroys most of the brain

443
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,300
during metamorphosis,

444
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,540
so many of the cells are killed,

445
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,700
the connections are broken,

446
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,380
and it refactors into a new brain.

447
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,260
But what has been found is that

448
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,700
if you train these caterpillars on a particular task,

449
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,660
the butterflies or moths that results still remember.

450
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,620
So there are two fascinating things here.

451
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,340
Not only is it amazing to ask,

452
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,060
where is the information that it's robust

453
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,860
to this incredible refactoring of the memory medium?

454
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,500
We don't have any technology like that.

455
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,380
If you start shuffling around

456
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,780
the pieces of your memory chips inside your computer,

457
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,140
nothing's gonna work.

458
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,900
But not only is the memory robust,

459
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,260
you actually, if you think about it,

460
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:56,580
you realize that you actually can't just store

461
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,660
the information,

462
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,940
you have to completely reinterpret it for a new context.

463
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,060
For example, if you teach these caterpillars to eat leaves

464
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,700
when you provide a certain color stimulus,

465
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,220
those specific memories are totally useless

466
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,300
to the butterfly because butterflies don't eat leaves

467
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,340
and they don't move around the way the caterpillars do.

468
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,020
They have to reinterpret those memories

469
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,300
in a brand new way suitable for this creature

470
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,620
in its three-dimensional new life.

471
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:23,240
So during these kind of transformations,

472
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,060
you see that memory,

473
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,020
biological memory isn't just stored,

474
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,900
it's actually actively, creatively reinterpreted.

475
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,460
These memory engrams that are made

476
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,340
are reinterpreted for their new lifetime.

477
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,320
So lots of fascinating things to be said

478
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,620
about behavioral memories and so on,

479
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,620
but I'm gonna spend a few minutes talking about

480
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:42,180
what we study, which is primarily anatomical memories.

481
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,060
So let's think about this.

482
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,860
This is a cross-section through the human body.

483
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,580
So look at this incredible complexity

484
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,340
of all the organs in the torso.

485
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:54,020
So everything is where it needs to be in the right place,

486
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,940
the right, you know, the right direction,

487
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,380
next to the right thing.

488
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,660
Almost all of the time,

489
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,520
where does this pattern come from?

490
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,780
Because we start life as a collection of blastomeres

491
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,220
and eventually these cells build something like this.

492
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,560
Where is that pattern?

493
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,660
People might be tempted to say DNA,

494
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,260
but we can read genomes now

495
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,620
and we know that is not what is in the genome.

496
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,020
What's in the genome are specifications of proteins,

497
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:19,660
the tiny molecular hardware that every cell gets to have.

498
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:24,660
But this structure is the outcome of the physiological software

499
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,180
that these cells are executing.

500
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:31,220
And so this information is no more in the genome

501
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:36,220
than is the actual structure of the colony of ants and termites

502
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,460
or the specific structure of a spider web

503
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,220
in the DNA of the spider.

504
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,860
So we have to really understand, okay,

505
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,860
how do the cells know what to make?

506
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,940
How do they know when to stop?

507
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:50,860
If something is damaged,

508
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,780
how do we convince them to repair it?

509
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,180
And actually, which I'll show you a little bit towards the end,

510
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,740
what else is that hardware willing to do?

511
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,780
What else can it build?

512
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,900
What can we make from the exact same cells

513
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,060
with the exact same DNA?

514
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:06,140
And now I like to think of kind of the end game

515
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,180
of our field here as this.

516
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,540
Someday, you're going to be able to sit down

517
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,500
in front of a computer

518
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,060
and use something called an anatomical compiler.

519
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,780
What's gonna happen here is that you will draw

520
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:20,460
the animal, plant, or a biobot, organoid, whatever

521
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,220
that you want at the level of anatomy,

522
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,540
not at the level of genetic circuits or anything like that,

523
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,860
but the actual anatomy.

524
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,380
And what the system ought to be able to do

525
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,300
is to compile down that anatomical description

526
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:35,340
into a specific set of stimuli

527
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,780
that have to be given to cells

528
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,980
to build exactly what you want to build.

529
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:42,020
Now, the practical reason we need something like this

530
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,100
is because imagine if you had the ability

531
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,540
to tell groups of cells what to build,

532
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:49,100
you would do away with birth defects.

533
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,340
You would be able to heal

534
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,380
and regenerate after traumatic injury.

535
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,660
You could reprogram cancer.

536
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,300
You could stop and reverse aging,

537
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,100
even stop degenerative disease.

538
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:57,940
All of these things,

539
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,540
all of these major problems of biomedicine would go away

540
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:03,060
if we understood how to get a group of cells

541
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,100
to build exactly what we want them to build.

542
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,100
Now, the key here is that this device

543
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,340
is not a 3D printer,

544
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,180
which is not about micromanaging cells

545
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,060
and trying to print body structures.

546
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,740
It's a communications device.

547
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:17,060
It's a way to translate your anatomical specification,

548
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,460
what it is that you're looking for,

549
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,220
into the gold states that these cells are accessing

550
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,540
when they build some particular structure.

551
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,420
Now, I'll tell you that we don't have anything

552
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,820
remotely like this.

553
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:30,020
And we can only do this in a few individual cases.

554
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,500
And the reason is,

555
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,980
is that here's where current state of the art is.

556
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:38,420
We're very good at manipulating cells and molecules,

557
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,220
processing information like this about

558
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,060
which genes interact with which other genes,

559
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,420
which proteins attach together and so on.

560
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,100
But we're really a long way away from what we really want,

561
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,020
which is complete control of large scale form and function.

562
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,580
Somebody is missing a limb.

563
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,780
We ought to be able to tell those cells to rebuild.

564
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,180
So why is that?

565
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,500
And I think it's because molecular medicine

566
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,300
has been largely stuck where computer science

567
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,340
was in the 1940s and 50s.

568
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,340
This is what it looks like,

569
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:08,020
that programming a computer used to look like.

570
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:08,860
You can see what she's doing.

571
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,060
She's interacting with the hardware.

572
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,780
She's rewiring the machine to get it to do something.

573
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,380
And you would all laugh if I told you

574
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,980
that on your laptops, nowadays,

575
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,340
if you wanted to go from Microsoft Word to Photoshop,

576
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,900
you would have to get out to soldering iron

577
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,460
and start rewiring.

578
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,980
The whole point of what we've learned

579
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,660
in computer science and information technology

580
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,460
over the years is that if your hardware is good enough

581
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,380
and the biological hardware is definitely good enough,

582
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,860
what you have here is a reprogrammable medium

583
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,540
that is much better off controlled by communication,

584
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,100
by signals, by stimuli.

585
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,700
And this is what we're still missing

586
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,020
out to a large degree in biomedicine.

587
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,500
We understand the hardware more or less.

588
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,820
We really have only begun to scratch the surface

589
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:55,100
of the software, the software of life, the intelligence

590
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,940
that's inherent in every layer of our body systems.

591
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,100
I'm gonna show you a couple of examples of this.

592
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,100
Well, first of all, we all know that development is reliable.

593
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,740
So most of the time, the egg will give rise

594
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,060
to a bunch of cells that build

595
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,260
the correct human target morphology.

596
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:14,660
But it's not just about emergent complexity or reliability.

597
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,540
It's actually much more interesting than that.

598
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:20,380
Because if you start cutting early embryos into pieces,

599
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,100
this is naturally how you get twins

600
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,180
and triplets and quadruplets.

601
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,940
You don't get half bodies,

602
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,580
you get perfectly normal monozygotic twins

603
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,900
and various multiples.

604
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,140
And this means that in this anatomical space

605
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,660
where you go from different starting states,

606
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:36,180
here's one, here's one, from different starting states,

607
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,220
all of them can navigate that space

608
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,220
to a particular ensemble of goal states

609
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,740
corresponding to valid human anatomies.

610
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:45,540
And sometimes they can actually avoid

611
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,820
all kinds of local minimum,

612
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,580
meaning perturbations that you give them along the way.

613
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,500
They can solve problems and get where they need to go.

614
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,940
This is William James' definition of intelligence,

615
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,780
the ability to get to the same end by different means.

616
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,900
This is what I mean by different types of intelligence

617
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,260
by navigating these problem spaces.

618
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,340
Now, some animals can do this throughout their lifespan.

619
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:08,300
So here is an axolotl and these amphibians

620
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,860
can regenerate their eyes, their jaws, their tails,

621
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,780
their limbs, portions of the heart and brain.

622
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:17,260
And what that looks like is when they bite each other's legs

623
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,140
off, no matter where that occurs,

624
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:22,700
whatever the piece is remaining,

625
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,220
these cells will build exactly what's needed,

626
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:28,300
no more, no less, to make a perfect salamander limb

627
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,500
and then they stop.

628
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,820
And that's the most amazing thing about regeneration

629
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,660
is that it knows when to stop.

630
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:37,100
And so this idea that you have a particular structure

631
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,980
and when you deviate from that structure,

632
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,940
the cells work really hard to get back

633
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,020
to that same region of anatomical space

634
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,700
and then they know that they've got there

635
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,660
and they know that that's their goal and then they stop.

636
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,540
So that is a kind of anatomical homeostasis.

637
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,940
It's the same thing that your thermostat does at home

638
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,180
where you set a set point.

639
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,420
And when the temperature goes off,

640
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:59,700
the system will work hard to get you back to that goal state

641
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,700
and then it stops, okay?

642
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,620
And by the way, this is not just this kind of regeneration,

643
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,980
it's not just for amphibians.

644
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:08,180
The human liver is highly regenerative.

645
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,740
Even the ancient Greeks knew that,

646
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:12,180
I have no idea how they knew that, but they did.

647
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:15,660
Deer every year will regenerate huge amounts of bone

648
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,380
and vasculature and innervation

649
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,980
when they regrow their antlers

650
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:23,620
up to a centimeter and a half of new bone per day they grow.

651
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:28,180
And even human children can regenerate their fingertips.

652
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,540
So if you just keep it clean,

653
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,340
these kind of amputations and kids end up

654
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,580
with a very nice cosmetic outcome.

655
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,100
So, but we're of course not as good

656
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,540
as salamanders or plenarium.

657
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:42,820
So I want to show you just kind of one of my favorite examples

658
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:46,540
to really try to bring home just how much amazing

659
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,940
creative problem solving these systems have.

660
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,980
This is a schematic of a cross-section

661
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:55,420
through a kidney tubule of a salamander.

662
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,420
And what you see here is that about eight to 10 cells

663
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,460
work together to build the structure

664
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,740
and then they leave a lumen in the middle

665
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,460
through which the fluid has to go.

666
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,820
One thing you can do is you can force these cells early on

667
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,740
to have way more genetic material than they should.

668
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,940
And when that happens, the nuclei get bigger

669
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,260
and the cells get bigger to accommodate.

670
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,460
When that happens, the resulting newt

671
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,100
is actually exactly the same size

672
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,500
because the cells adjust.

673
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,260
Fewer of these larger cells are now getting together

674
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,700
to make exactly the same lumen.

675
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,220
The most amazing thing happens

676
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,260
when you make these cells truly gigantic,

677
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:29,340
then it uses a completely different molecular mechanism

678
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,220
such that only one cell wraps around itself

679
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,540
leaving a hole in the middle

680
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,820
and still gives you the exact same structure.

681
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,820
So think of what this means.

682
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:39,540
If you're a newt coming into the world,

683
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,180
you don't know how many copies

684
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,060
of your genetic material you're going to have.

685
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,700
You don't know how big your cells are going to be.

686
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,940
You don't know how many cells you're going to have.

687
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:47,780
You have to figure out,

688
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,500
you have to use all the tools that you're disposing,

689
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,700
all the molecular mechanisms that you have

690
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,700
to solve this problem.

691
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,500
How do I get from being an egg to being an adult

692
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,700
despite all these novelties?

693
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,620
You can't count on anything.

694
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,780
You can't assume that your evolutionary history

695
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:03,860
has prepared you for knowing what to do.

696
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:06,060
And the same thing happens in the transition

697
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:09,260
from tadpole to frog.

698
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,860
They have to rearrange their whole face,

699
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,660
but these Picasso tadpoles,

700
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,540
which have the organs in abnormal locations.

701
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,780
So the eyes on the back of the head,

702
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,220
the mouth is off to the side.

703
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,700
These guys still make quite normal frogs

704
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,660
because all of these organs will move in unnatural paths

705
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,020
to get to where they need to go

706
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,340
to look like a good frog and then they stop.

707
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:33,460
So this means that genetics does not actually give you

708
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:36,500
some kind of hardwired automatic process

709
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,660
that just goes in the same direction.

710
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,420
What it does encode is a machine

711
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,980
that can do an error minimization scheme.

712
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,300
It can actually get to where it needs to go

713
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,260
despite all sorts of things going wrong.

714
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,780
So now this raises an obvious question.

715
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,260
How does it know what's right?

716
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:54,460
How do these things know what a correct frog face looks like?

717
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:58,740
So we've been studying this and the sort of

718
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:02,420
uncontroversial example of collections of cells

719
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,700
storing a goal state for behavior

720
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,020
is what happens in the brain.

721
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,180
So the way it works in the brain

722
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,180
is that you have these electrical networks

723
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,420
of cells that communicate electrically

724
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:15,020
via ions that go in and out of these little ion channels

725
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,500
and then they pass through these electrical synapses

726
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,620
and the computations that are processed by that network

727
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:25,420
result in the software that we see as behavior.

728
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:29,620
So basically here, this is a living zebrafish brain

729
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,900
that the commitment of neuroscience

730
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,540
is that if we knew how to decode

731
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:36,220
all of this electrophysiological activity,

732
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,300
we could read out the thoughts, the memories,

733
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:42,700
the goal states, the competencies of this animal.

734
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,780
Well, it turns out that this is not anything special

735
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:48,060
or unique to brains.

736
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,340
Every cell in your body has these ion channels.

737
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:53,220
Most cells have electrical connections to their neighbors

738
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,020
and evolution discovered that these electrical networks

739
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,980
were good for processing information

740
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,260
a really long time ago,

741
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:02,060
back around the beginning of bacterial biofilms

742
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,860
actually long before multicellularity

743
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,820
or brains or nerves or anything like that.

744
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,460
So then one can ask,

745
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:11,380
well, if the electrical networks of the brain

746
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:14,420
think about moving you through three-dimensional space,

747
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:17,140
what do the electrical networks of the body think about?

748
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:21,300
What were these cells thinking about before there were brains?

749
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,180
And what we've been studying is this idea

750
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,060
that what they're thinking about

751
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,340
is how to navigate anatomical space.

752
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,420
They're thinking about how to get from

753
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,580
whatever situation they happen to be in,

754
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,860
whether a normal egg or some kind of perturbed system

755
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:35,700
into the right kind of body for the environment

756
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,020
in which they find themselves.

757
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,660
So in order to do this,

758
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,740
we've developed some interesting techniques

759
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:43,060
using voltage-sensitive fluorescent dyes

760
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:46,740
to really literally read the mind of the body

761
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,820
to see all the electrical conversations

762
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,940
that cells are having with each other.

763
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,100
So these are not computer models.

764
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,420
These are real, you know, these are some cells

765
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:56,380
and this is an early frog embryo and the colors

766
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:59,340
are signals from a voltage reporter dye

767
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:02,580
that enables us to see what all the electrical states are.

768
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,060
We are reading it.

769
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,700
We then have all these computer models

770
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,460
that we use to try to understand and try to decode

771
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,580
what are the memories here.

772
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:13,380
And I'm going to show you some examples.

773
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,540
This is an early frog embryo putting its face together.

774
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:21,020
It's quite dynamic, but here's one frame from that video.

775
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:23,180
And you can see the bioelectric pattern here.

776
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,300
We call this the electric face

777
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,940
because it basically looks like a face.

778
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,900
Here's where it knows the eye needs to go.

779
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,620
Here's where the mouth needs to go.

780
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,340
Some other organs out here.

781
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,580
This is where the organs are going to be in the future.

782
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:38,460
This is a pre-pattern that it uses to figure out

783
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,460
where to put all the craniofacial organs.

784
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:43,260
Now, it's not just cells within an embryo that communicate

785
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:46,460
but actually individual embryos communicate with each other.

786
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,140
So you can see what's happening here in the group

787
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:52,420
that when this guy sets off a wave, they all feel it.

788
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,060
And here are a bunch of cells where you can see

789
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:56,460
there's some neural firing here,

790
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,660
but there are also some lots of activity

791
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,420
in these non-neural cells.

792
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:03,580
So these are pretty ubiquitous.

793
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,700
These electrical networks are pretty ubiquitous.

794
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:09,300
Now, observing these amazing bioelectrical signals

795
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,260
is fun in the reading,

796
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,980
but you don't know that the patterns mean anything

797
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,980
unless you can functionally alter them.

798
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,420
You alter them and you see what happens.

799
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:23,340
So we've developed tools mostly borrowed from neuroscience.

800
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,700
And I think one of the lessons we're learning

801
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,540
is that neuroscience is really not about neurons at all.

802
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,220
The deep lessons of neuroscience

803
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:33,260
tell us about all cells and body intelligence more broadly.

804
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:36,580
And what we do is we change these bioelectrical patterns.

805
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,660
We don't use, there are no electrodes,

806
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:42,060
there are no magnets, no waves, no frequencies,

807
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,900
no electromagnetic radiation.

808
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,900
What we do is we hack the normal interface

809
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,620
that cells are using to hack each other's behavior,

810
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,780
which is the ion channels on their surface

811
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,020
and the gap junctions that they use

812
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,620
to exchange electrical signals.

813
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,820
This is what we target.

814
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,540
So we control how cells communicate

815
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,100
with each other electrically.

816
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,940
And when you do this, you can do some really cool things.

817
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,060
For example, by injecting some RNA

818
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,820
and coding a potassium channel,

819
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,900
which changes the voltage of the cells,

820
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,940
we can induce a little spot in the sombrero

821
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:12,740
that looks just like that eye spot in that electric face.

822
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,140
But when you do that somewhere else,

823
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:17,740
for example, in cells that are going to become gut,

824
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:20,860
what you've just done is tell these cells, build an eye here.

825
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:24,580
You have not said anything about how the eye should form,

826
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,380
what are the components of an eye.

827
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,000
You haven't said anything to the stem cells

828
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,280
or to the specific genes inside of each one.

829
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,600
You're talking to the collective,

830
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,480
to the collective intelligence of cells

831
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,480
that are trying to navigate morphospace.

832
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,520
And what you've said is go to the region

833
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,440
that corresponds to making an eye.

834
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,080
And they know how to do this.

835
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,800
Here are all the internal tissues of these eyes,

836
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,040
so lens, retina, optic nerve, all that.

837
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,240
And they even have some other cool properties

838
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,360
that you find in other collective intelligences,

839
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,920
like ants, which is that,

840
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:59,040
so here's a lens sitting out in the flank of a tadpole

841
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,040
somewhere, if you inject just a few cells,

842
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,640
not enough to really make a whole eye,

843
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,400
so the blue ones are the ones we injected,

844
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,620
what they will do is recruit their neighbors.

845
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,640
They tell their neighbors that,

846
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,240
hey, you need to participate with us in making this eye

847
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,640
and they instruct them.

848
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,940
So we instruct these cells, you should make an eye,

849
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,560
they then instruct their neighbors.

850
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,760
So all of these competencies,

851
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,640
knowing how to make an eye,

852
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,160
knowing how many cells there are in recruiting new cells

853
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,560
if they need to, all of this is built in

854
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,400
as part of the competency of the material

855
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,600
that we're dealing with.

856
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:32,780
And we have extended this towards some regenerative

857
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:35,720
applications, there are huge numbers of people living

858
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,680
with limb and organ loss every day.

859
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,360
We need therapeutics that are not just going to be

860
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,780
for wound healing, but actually to regenerate whole organs.

861
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:47,480
And we can see here that what happens here,

862
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,160
normally frogs, unlike salamanders,

863
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,840
do not regenerate their legs,

864
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:54,680
but we've come up with a cocktail that triggers

865
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,640
not only pro-regenerative gene expression here,

866
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,280
but actually within 45 days,

867
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,200
you've already got some toes in the toenail.

868
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,360
But in our latest experiments,

869
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,200
what happens is that the treatment itself,

870
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:10,160
the bioelectric cocktail is applied for about 24 hours.

871
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,440
After that, you get a year and a half of leg growth

872
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,480
in the adult fraud.

873
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,440
You don't touch it at all during that time.

874
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,840
This is not about micromanaging,

875
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,920
this is not about controlling the stem cells

876
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,280
or 3D printing anything.

877
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,840
This is about telling the cells very early on,

878
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,000
go down the leg regeneration path, not the scarring path.

879
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,600
And so eventually you get a quite nice leg

880
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,840
that is touch sensitive and motile.

881
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,280
We are in the process of moving this to mammals now.

882
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,440
I should say that I have to do disclosure here

883
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,920
because Dave Kaplan and I have a company

884
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,880
whose job it is to try to move this

885
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,880
into a mammalian models and hopefully patients.

886
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,060
And David's group makes these wearable bioreactors

887
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:51,800
that apply the ion channel drug payload.

888
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,240
And come back to the plan area for a moment

889
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,040
because there's something really interesting here

890
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,120
about how we reprogram these pattern memories.

891
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:04,200
And I want to show you the plasticity of the material

892
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,200
that we're dealing with.

893
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,600
So here are the plan area that I was telling you

894
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,520
about some amazing properties

895
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,920
that we can talk about if people have questions

896
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,720
as far as cancer resistance, immortality.

897
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,480
I mean, these guys literally don't seem to age and so on.

898
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,320
But one of the things that we need to understand

899
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,440
is if they were to be chopped into three pieces,

900
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,440
so you got this middle fragment here,

901
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,440
100% of the time it grows one head and one tail

902
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,960
and you get a normal plan area.

903
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,360
So another question is how does it know?

904
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,400
How does this thing know how many heads it's supposed to have

905
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,680
and where the heads are supposed to be?

906
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,680
So it turns out that there's an electrical circuit

907
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,880
that controls this and we've characterized that circuit

908
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,480
and we've learned to rewrite it.

909
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:47,360
So that what happens here is that this bioelectrical pattern,

910
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,900
so this is the memory, this is literally the memory

911
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,820
of the collective intelligence of the body

912
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,940
as far as how many heads it's supposed to have in here,

913
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:54,780
one head.

914
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,340
So what we can do is we can change that pattern to say,

915
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,300
no, two heads, and when you do that in this animal,

916
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,060
after you amputate, then it goes ahead

917
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,100
and makes a two-headed animal.

918
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,220
This isn't Photoshop or AI or anything like that,

919
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,500
these are real animals.

920
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,420
And this bioelectric pattern is not a map

921
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,940
of this two-headed guy.

922
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,940
This pattern is the pattern that we

923
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:19,780
have incepted into this one-headed normal worm.

924
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,460
It's anatomically normal,

925
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:24,260
the molecular gene expression is normal.

926
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,660
Here's where the head genes are.

927
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:29,620
But it has a different internal representation

928
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,900
of what a correct planarian should look like.

929
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,180
We've rewritten the goal, the target state.

930
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:36,560
So this is not micromanaging the cells,

931
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,020
this is changing the mind of this collective intelligence

932
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:42,180
as far as what I should do if I get injured in the future.

933
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,220
So it's really a counterfactual memory.

934
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,340
And one planarian body, a normal planarian body,

935
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:51,100
can store at least one of two possible representations

936
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,620
of what a normal worm should look like.

937
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:56,700
And in fact, one of the most remarkable things

938
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:00,940
is that once you do that, the memory stays.

939
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:03,880
Two-headed worms cut again and again in plain water

940
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:07,360
will continue to regenerate as two-headed animals.

941
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,460
It's permanent, even though there's nothing wrong

942
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,820
with the genetics of this animal.

943
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,060
We have not touched the genome,

944
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,740
there are no trans genes.

945
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,940
This is purely bioelectrical.

946
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:19,020
I showed you exactly where the electrical memory is stored

947
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,060
and how we can see it.

948
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:23,820
And here are these two-headed worms.

949
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:26,340
And not only can we change the number of heads,

950
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,160
but we can actually change the shape of the head

951
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,860
to that of other species.

952
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:32,900
So the shape of the head of this triangle species

953
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,940
can become flat like a Pifalina.

954
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:37,420
It can become round like an S-Mediterrania.

955
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:40,060
Shape of the brain changes like these other species.

956
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:42,780
The shape of the position of the stem cells does.

957
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:46,340
So in this anatomical morphospace where you have attractors,

958
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,220
you have these deep attractors corresponding

959
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,740
to other species, they live there naturally,

960
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:53,100
but you can get a different species, such as this guy,

961
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:58,100
to visit these other attractors because it's so reprogrammable.

962
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,100
Not only that, you can take it further

963
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:05,060
and find regions of morphospace where you know,

964
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:07,580
machine learning folks will call this a latent morphospace

965
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:11,620
where you can build things that are not normal plenaria

966
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:14,060
at all, things that are spiky or cylindrical

967
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,820
or combinations like this.

968
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:18,500
So what I'm showing you is that the body is incredibly plastic.

969
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,780
It's reprogrammable at the level of physiology,

970
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:25,780
not necessarily the genetically specified hardware,

971
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,660
but we are not the only bioengineers

972
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:31,300
that can hack this kind of morphogenetic navigation.

973
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,660
This is what you normally see.

974
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,620
Acorns make something like this.

975
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,540
And you kind of get that this is extremely reliable.

976
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,740
This happens so often that you get the idea that, okay,

977
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:42,420
well, the oak genome just knows how to do this.

978
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,940
This is what the oak genome knows how to do.

979
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,740
That is what they do every single time.

980
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:49,220
But there's this amazing bioengineer, this WASP,

981
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,060
and it's a parasite.

982
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:54,100
And what the parasite does is using some kind of chemicals

983
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,900
that are still poorly understood,

984
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,940
it basically hacks the surrounding plant cells

985
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,740
to build something completely different.

986
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:04,780
Would you have any idea that these flat,

987
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:07,740
the nice, flat green leaves with a normal genome,

988
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,220
a completely normal genome,

989
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:12,140
were capable of building something as crazy as this?

990
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,100
We'd have no idea.

991
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,420
And people talk about developmental constraints.

992
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,780
I don't, you know, there's a lot of constraints

993
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,260
in our thinking about the process,

994
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:22,540
but I'm not sure we understand morphogenic constraints at all.

995
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:25,580
I think they're much broader than people think.

996
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:28,980
And this kind of hacking is ubiquitous in biology,

997
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:31,060
and we are just learning to do it.

998
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:35,020
And with this notion of what lies beyond

999
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,820
the normal morphology, you know, repair,

1000
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:40,980
repair of the typical anatomy, but what's beyond that?

1001
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,300
And I wanna show you this,

1002
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:46,180
basically this last example, which is this.

1003
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:48,020
If I showed you this little organism,

1004
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:50,100
and I would ask you to guess what this is,

1005
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:53,220
you might say we've found this at the bottom of a pond

1006
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:57,620
somewhere, it's some kind of primitive microorganism.

1007
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,660
If you were to sequence the genome of this,

1008
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:02,620
what you would get is 100% Homo sapiens.

1009
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,620
This is what we call these anthrobots.

1010
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:08,460
They are made of adult patient tracheal epithelia.

1011
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:12,780
So adult often elderly patients donate their tracheal cells.

1012
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:15,260
We have a protocol that lets these cells

1013
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:19,860
reboot their multicellularity and live an entirely new life

1014
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:22,900
that has new shapes and behaviors.

1015
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:27,380
They look nothing like any stage of human development.

1016
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:29,620
And one of the unique things that they know

1017
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:33,420
how to do, which is really shocking and surprising,

1018
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,900
is that they know how to heal neural wounds.

1019
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,780
So if you put down some human neurons in addition,

1020
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,980
you put a big scratch through them,

1021
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:43,540
these anthrobots will sit down in this kind

1022
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,260
of like super bot cluster.

1023
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,620
And what you'll see when you lift them up four days later,

1024
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,300
what they've done is they've taken the two sides

1025
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,500
of the neural wound and they knit them together.

1026
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,900
Who would have ever thought that your tracheal cells,

1027
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,900
which sit there quietly for decades in your airway,

1028
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,260
actually have given the opportunity

1029
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:01,540
to make a multi little creature that runs around on its own

1030
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,020
and has lots of interesting abilities,

1031
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:07,860
such as, for example, healing neural wounds.

1032
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,900
And so this one of the biomedical aspects of this

1033
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:13,180
is that this is a personalized medicine

1034
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:16,460
where cells from your own body, not genetically modified,

1035
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,540
there's no reason to genetically modify them,

1036
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:23,300
can be used to heal your own body from with,

1037
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,940
and no need for, for example, eye immune suppression

1038
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,140
because they're your own cells.

1039
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:28,980
They're not some sort of heterologous cell type.

1040
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,740
So this kind of agential biomedical intervention,

1041
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:35,180
these kind of biobots made from your own cells to heal

1042
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:38,740
are, I think, a huge potential application for the future.

1043
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:42,660
So the last thing I'll just say is that,

1044
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:46,820
not only do we have these two continuum that remind us

1045
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:51,460
that we are on an unbroken, slow continuum

1046
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:54,580
with all kinds of other unusual forms, including cells,

1047
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:56,260
and whatever you say about adult humans,

1048
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:58,820
you have to ask, what can you say

1049
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:01,300
about some of these other intermediate forms?

1050
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,940
But also there's another continuum here,

1051
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:07,100
which consists of now rational changes that are made

1052
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:11,380
for various kinds of modifications and augmentations.

1053
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:14,540
So both technological and purely biological,

1054
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:16,260
I think that the future belongs

1055
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,140
to a kind of freedom of embodiment.

1056
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:21,260
I think that this standard form,

1057
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:24,140
that evolution just sort of happened to drop us off in,

1058
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,260
is susceptible to degenerative brain disease

1059
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:29,260
and limited IQ and limited lifespan

1060
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:33,020
and susceptible to all kinds of the dumb bacterial infections

1061
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:35,900
and lower back pain and bad vision and all these things.

1062
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:39,420
I don't think we have any particular commitment

1063
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:41,500
or allegiance to any of that.

1064
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:45,300
We are going to be improving some of the bad hardware

1065
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:48,660
and some of the bad firmware that evolution has left us with.

1066
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:51,460
And at every level of organization,

1067
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:54,980
you can think about augmenting these systems

1068
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:59,060
that were designed by basically a random walk with selection

1069
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:01,380
with rationally designed materials.

1070
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:05,940
So I think that in the future, all of you, young people,

1071
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:10,180
and I think, even I will get to see a bunch of this, I think,

1072
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:14,820
will be living with a huge number of alien bodies and minds.

1073
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:19,020
We already have some people that are some degree of cyborg.

1074
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:22,700
We will have hybrids and chimeres and synthetic life forms.

1075
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:26,660
And because of that kind of plasticity of life

1076
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:29,180
that I showed you, that interoperability is huge.

1077
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:33,900
So pretty much any combination of evolved material,

1078
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,020
engineered material and software

1079
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,940
is some kind of living agent.

1080
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:40,500
And all of these things are going to have diverse bodies

1081
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,900
and diverse minds.

1082
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:46,300
And we really better step up and go well beyond

1083
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:51,300
very ancient and crumbling rules of thumb

1084
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,740
about how we deal with each other

1085
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:58,780
in terms of what are you made of and how did you get here?

1086
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:00,660
Those are the kinds of things that we ask

1087
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:02,260
when we try to understand is something

1088
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:04,860
a quote unquote machine that we can do whatever we want with

1089
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:09,820
or is it a living organism to whom we owe certain kinds

1090
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:13,140
of moral stances, those categories are going to go out the window

1091
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:16,220
because there are going to be all sorts of forms

1092
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:20,100
that challenge those superficial categories.

1093
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,100
And what I think we're looking for is a kind of ethical

1094
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,580
synthbiosis with a bunch of life forms

1095
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:27,260
that are nowhere on the tree of life with us.

1096
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,940
So I'm going to stop here and just say that

1097
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:33,260
if anybody's interested in diving more into this stuff,

1098
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:36,300
here are some kind of academic papers.

1099
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:39,580
There's much more sort of general purpose writings

1100
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:41,420
on this kind of thing at my blog.

1101
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:44,060
I want to thank the people who did all the work.

1102
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:46,620
So these are all the postdocs and the grad students

1103
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:50,780
who did the biology that I showed you today.

1104
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:53,460
We have lots of amazing collaborators.

1105
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,820
None of this is possible without our technical support

1106
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:57,980
personnel, our funders.

1107
00:45:57,980 --> 00:45:59,180
Again, I have to do a disclosure.

1108
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:02,460
These are the companies that support our work

1109
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,540
and most of all the model systems,

1110
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:07,900
the animals and the microbes and so on

1111
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:10,260
because they teach us everything here.

1112
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:12,020
So yeah, thanks very much.

1113
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:19,060
Thank you.

1114
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:22,060
OK, I think we have time for some questions.

1115
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:25,060
So we will start here.

1116
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:28,060
Thank you.

1117
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:30,060
This was very interesting.

1118
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:33,060
If I understood correctly, you state

1119
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:38,060
that these morphological plasticity and regenerative

1120
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:42,060
plasticity is not really encoded in our genome,

1121
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:45,060
but more in the bioelectrical properties

1122
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:48,060
and activity of the cells or the organism.

1123
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:54,060
However, the bioelectrical properties of an organism

1124
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:59,060
or of a cell depend on the channels,

1125
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:01,060
voltage dependent or independent channels

1126
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:05,060
that are expressed by a given cell,

1127
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:07,060
which are encoded in our genome.

1128
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:14,060
So in a way, the bioelectrical properties

1129
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:16,060
and therefore the all the morphological

1130
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:18,060
plasticity and regenerative capacity

1131
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:21,060
is encoded in our genome.

1132
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:23,060
Well, let's think about it.

1133
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:27,060
So certainly you need the hardware for any of it to work.

1134
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:29,060
So without the hardware, without the channels,

1135
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:31,060
none of this is going to work.

1136
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:34,060
But encoded is a funny word.

1137
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:36,060
Imagine, I don't know if you've ever seen this thing,

1138
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:37,060
it's called a Galton board.

1139
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:39,060
You can get it on Amazon for about 20 bucks.

1140
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:40,060
It's a toy.

1141
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:42,060
What it is, it's just imagine a board

1142
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:44,060
and you bang a bunch of nails into it, right?

1143
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:46,060
And then you take a bucket of marbles

1144
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:48,060
and you dump it into the top of the board.

1145
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:50,060
So the marbles go bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,

1146
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:51,060
and they all land on the bottom.

1147
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:53,060
What's the shape of the resulting marbles?

1148
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:56,060
What you always get is this lovely bell curve.

1149
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:58,060
It has a very particular shape to it.

1150
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:59,060
And so you can ask yourself,

1151
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:02,060
where is the shape of that bell curve encoded?

1152
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:06,060
And so you can, certainly it's not going to appear

1153
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:09,060
if you don't have the wood and the nails and the marbles,

1154
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:13,060
but you can study the material of the wood and the nails

1155
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:14,060
and everything else all day long.

1156
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:15,060
What you're not going to find

1157
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:17,060
is a direct encoding of that bell curve.

1158
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,060
So the real question in all of this

1159
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:21,060
is to go beyond the terminology.

1160
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:23,060
I mean, I'm much less interested in terminology

1161
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:28,060
and more interested in what kind of conceptual framework

1162
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:30,060
lets us do better experiments

1163
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:32,060
in order to get new capabilities.

1164
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:36,060
So if you want to make changes,

1165
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:38,060
if you want to induce repair,

1166
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:40,060
you'll fix birth defects, normalize cancer,

1167
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:41,060
which are all things we've done

1168
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:43,060
that I didn't get a chance to talk about,

1169
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:44,060
the question is that you're better off

1170
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:46,060
thinking about the material, the hardware,

1171
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:48,060
or are you better off understanding the software

1172
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:51,060
that happens there and targeting that?

1173
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:54,060
And that's exactly what I was trying to argue,

1174
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:56,060
that all of modern molecular medicine

1175
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:59,060
has done some amazing things with respect to hardware,

1176
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:02,060
but most of what we are not able to do currently

1177
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:05,060
is precisely because we've stayed at that level,

1178
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:07,060
which computer science and information technology

1179
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:09,060
left behind in the 40s.

1180
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:12,060
So yes, the hardware is important,

1181
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:14,060
but we don't all program with a soldering iron,

1182
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:18,060
and that's exactly what I'm saying as far as these.

1183
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:21,060
The reason we were able to do some of the things

1184
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:23,060
that we've done, which had never been done before,

1185
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:28,060
is precisely because we were able to adopt conceptual frameworks

1186
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:30,060
from neuroscience and from other fields

1187
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:33,060
that really take very seriously the guidance

1188
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:36,060
of the final outcome, not by the hardware itself,

1189
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:39,060
but by the software components

1190
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:42,060
that are not actually directly encoded by the hardware,

1191
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:47,060
but of course require it to function in the physical world.

1192
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:51,060
Thank you.

1193
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:53,060
Thank you for a very interesting talk.

1194
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:57,060
My question was in relation to,

1195
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,060
I guess you said it's not genetic,

1196
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:01,060
it's more about the stimuli that you use

1197
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:04,060
to change how the cells function

1198
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:06,060
and turn into what they're supposed to be.

1199
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:08,060
I'm wondering, like with those frogs

1200
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:12,060
where you were able to reproduce most of a leg,

1201
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:16,060
if you made generation one of the frogs,

1202
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:20,060
which were able to, using the stimuli,

1203
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:22,060
create this new leg,

1204
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:25,060
would generation two of the offspring,

1205
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:28,060
if you cut the leg, grow a new leg

1206
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:30,060
because you've reprogrammed those cells

1207
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:33,060
and at this point it is the genetic,

1208
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:35,060
I know we're trying to understand the difference

1209
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:38,060
between genetics and the stimuli,

1210
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:41,060
but would generation two have the capability

1211
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:46,060
and the cell memory to regrow that leg?

1212
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:48,060
Yeah, great question.

1213
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:50,060
We haven't done the experiment.

1214
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:53,060
I don't really predict that it would

1215
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:58,060
because I could sort of make up a mechanism

1216
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:00,060
by which that would happen,

1217
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:03,060
but I doubt it would be actually

1218
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:07,060
that this would be transmitted to the next generation

1219
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:10,060
through the egg and sperm and so on.

1220
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:12,060
But there is an interesting example of what you're talking about,

1221
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:13,060
which is in these planaria,

1222
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:15,060
so we make these two-headed animals,

1223
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:17,060
again, perfectly normal genetics.

1224
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:20,060
That's another reason why the genome is insufficient for all this

1225
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:23,060
because if you just sequence the genome of the two-headed

1226
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:25,060
and the one-headed form, they're identical.

1227
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:28,060
You would have no idea that you're looking at a two-headed worm.

1228
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:31,060
It's simply not in the genetics for that reason.

1229
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:34,060
Those two-headed worms, when they reproduce,

1230
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:37,060
so the way these worms reproduce is they tear themselves in half,

1231
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:39,060
so they just tear themselves in half

1232
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:41,060
and they regenerate, now you've got two worms.

1233
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:43,060
So that's their mode of reproduction

1234
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:45,060
and under that mode of reproduction,

1235
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:48,060
the offspring do in fact inherit the two-headed ones.

1236
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:50,060
So that's how they form fission

1237
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:52,060
and they create more two-headed worms permanently.

1238
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:55,060
So you've made a permanent line of animals

1239
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:58,060
that have a different anatomical structure

1240
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:00,060
and you can imagine, we could throw it in the Charles River,

1241
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:02,060
we wouldn't, but you could imagine

1242
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:04,060
throwing it in the Charles River here in Boston

1243
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:05,060
in a hundred years from now,

1244
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:07,060
some scientists come along and they scoop up some samples

1245
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:09,060
and they go, oh, cool.

1246
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:12,060
Two-headed form and a one-headed form must be a speciation event.

1247
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:16,060
Let's sequence the genome and see where the speciation event happened

1248
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:18,060
and see the difference between them.

1249
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:19,060
That is not where it is.

1250
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:21,060
And so that kind of a thing does propagate

1251
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:25,060
because the animals are not squeezing through a single,

1252
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:27,060
kind of a bottleneck of a single egg cell.

1253
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:29,060
So there's a chunk of the planarian

1254
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:31,060
which now remembers that it's two-headed

1255
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:33,060
and that chunk regrows into a new animal.

1256
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:36,060
Can that pass through a single egg cell?

1257
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:38,060
I don't know, we have no evidence that it can.

1258
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:40,060
I could sort of imagine how it would happen,

1259
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:45,060
but we haven't shown anything like that yet.

1260
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:49,060
Hi, thank you for your talk.

1261
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:54,060
My question is how you propose that this bio

1262
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:59,060
or this electrical information is integrated in these organisms.

1263
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:04,060
For context, I work on the PAC-6 regulatory genome.

1264
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:08,060
So seeing these eyes kind of generate just solely

1265
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:11,060
from electrical stimulus kind of makes me think

1266
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:15,060
it's not the genes themselves, but the DNA outside these genes.

1267
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:17,060
But I would love to hear your thoughts on that.

1268
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:19,060
Yeah, great question.

1269
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:20,060
So a couple things.

1270
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:23,060
So first, just kind of a little inside baseball about PAC-6.

1271
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:26,060
So in frog, and pardon me if you know all this,

1272
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:29,060
but in frog, PAC-6 will only induce eyes

1273
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:31,060
in the anterior rectoderm, right?

1274
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:32,060
Just in the front of the head.

1275
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:35,060
And if you actually look at the developmental biology textbook,

1276
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:38,060
what they tell you is that while the anterior and rectoderm

1277
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:41,060
are the only cells competent to become eyes,

1278
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:44,060
because they probed it with the master iGinc PAC-6.

1279
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:46,060
If you use PAC-6 as your stimulus,

1280
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:49,060
it's true only the anterior and rectoderm can form eyes.

1281
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:55,060
But if you probe the cells with a much more meaningful stimulus

1282
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:57,060
to them, which is these bioelectrical states,

1283
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:59,060
actually you find out that pretty much,

1284
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:02,060
I mean we haven't found a region in the body that can't do it yet.

1285
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:06,060
So these competencies, what we think of as competencies

1286
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:09,060
are really relative to how much we've understood the material

1287
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:12,060
we're working with and the limitations of the material

1288
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:14,060
are often limitations of our understanding,

1289
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:16,060
not the actual competency of the material.

1290
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:18,060
So now how does it work?

1291
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:22,060
So what we do know for all of these cases

1292
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:25,060
is the molecular steps on a single cell level.

1293
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:27,060
So we know that when we change the voltage,

1294
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:29,060
we know the transduction machinery,

1295
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:32,060
we know how that voltage is converted to second messenger pathways,

1296
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:34,060
how those turn various genes on and off,

1297
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:38,060
some of them have to do with other kinds of chromatin modifications.

1298
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:40,060
We have all those steps.

1299
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:43,060
All of that stuff, while it's important to know,

1300
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:45,060
is really extremely unsatisfying

1301
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:49,060
because the phenomenon itself is not a single cell phenomenon.

1302
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:52,060
So what I'm truly interested in is not tracking down

1303
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:56,060
how one cell's voltage turns on specific genes.

1304
00:54:56,060 --> 00:55:00,060
That's just part of the, I mean it's an important part,

1305
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:03,060
but it's just part of the story because what you really want to understand

1306
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:08,060
is okay, but why is the whole thing scaled correctly?

1307
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:11,060
What's the difference between the hand and the foot?

1308
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:15,060
Why the shape of a particular structure?

1309
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:18,060
And so what we're doing now is we're using

1310
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:21,060
computational models of network computations,

1311
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:23,060
so not single cells but networks of cells,

1312
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:26,060
that try to understand how the collective makes decisions

1313
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:28,060
about its size and shape and things like that.

1314
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:31,060
So there are for sure molecular stories to be told

1315
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:34,060
about how the voltage turns genes on and off,

1316
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:37,060
but what you really want is an understanding of

1317
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:39,060
why a particular voltage kicks off,

1318
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:42,060
eyes versus legs versus, and that whole conversation,

1319
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:46,060
like what happens when we induce these eye spots?

1320
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:49,060
There's a whole conversation that happens between those cells and their neighbors

1321
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:51,060
because those cells are saying to their neighbors,

1322
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:54,060
help us make an eye, and so we also need to understand

1323
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:57,060
it's not enough to know why those cells turn on various genes.

1324
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:59,060
We need to know what are they saying to their neighbors

1325
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:02,060
and how many, and how do they know how many of them there are,

1326
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:04,060
but those cells are actually saying back,

1327
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:07,060
no, no, you should not be an eye, you need to be normal skin,

1328
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:09,060
and that's a cancer suppression mechanism,

1329
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:12,060
the cells that have weird voltages get told by their neighbors

1330
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:15,060
through the gap junctions, they get communicated to try and normalize.

1331
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:18,060
So there's a whole battle that's going on of identities

1332
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:20,060
and it's not an identity on a cell level,

1333
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:23,060
it's not stem cells trying to decide what cell type they should be,

1334
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:26,060
it's large regions saying we are going to be an eye

1335
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:29,060
versus we are going to be a leg or skin or whatever.

1336
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:33,060
So it's a very multi-scale problem,

1337
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:35,060
the same way that neuroscience is multi-scale,

1338
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:38,060
where yeah, there are people who study synaptic proteins,

1339
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:42,060
but there are also people who study psychiatric diseases

1340
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:44,060
and psychoanalysis and so on,

1341
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:46,060
and every step in between, all the network science

1342
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:48,060
and in between those two levels,

1343
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:51,060
this is going to be that kind of science, I think.

1344
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:58,060
Thank you for your talk.

1345
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:00,060
I have two questions.

1346
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:04,060
One is what is the most frustrating thing for you

1347
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:08,060
for this field to move forward, if it's not a secret?

1348
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:11,060
And the other thing, maybe I missed it,

1349
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:15,060
but did you mention how this electrical pathways

1350
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:19,060
are programmed in the beginning, like initially,

1351
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:21,060
because you changed them,

1352
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:25,060
so there was something that gave them at birth?

1353
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:27,060
Yeah, good question.

1354
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:30,060
So in the frog,

1355
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:33,060
we can watch them form from the moment of fertilization.

1356
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:37,060
So what happens is that the process of fertilization

1357
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:41,060
breaks symmetry and we've characterized this

1358
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:43,060
from the very earliest stages,

1359
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:47,060
how the various ion channels that are present

1360
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:50,060
set up different kinds of electrical states

1361
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:52,060
that start to perform different computations

1362
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:54,060
and end up breaking symmetry,

1363
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:56,060
amplifying that symmetry and then making decisions

1364
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:58,060
who's going to be left, who's going to be right

1365
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:00,060
for anterior, posterior, and so on.

1366
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:02,060
So it's a combination of ways.

1367
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:04,060
So where do these patterns come from?

1368
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:08,060
Well, it's a combination of emergence

1369
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:10,060
in the same way that Turing patterns, right?

1370
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:12,060
So people who study chemical signals

1371
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:14,060
have this formalism of Turing patterns,

1372
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:17,060
which break symmetry and create order

1373
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:20,060
out of well-mixed chemical media.

1374
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:22,060
So some of it is emergent.

1375
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:24,060
Some of it is, of course, constrained by the hardware.

1376
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:26,060
So you need to have the appropriate,

1377
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:28,060
as somebody was saying there,

1378
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:30,060
you need to have the right hardware

1379
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:32,060
that's sufficiently powerful to do it,

1380
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:34,060
which means voltage-gated ion channels

1381
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:36,060
and voltage-gated gap junctions and things like that.

1382
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:40,060
And part of it comes from

1383
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:42,060
wherever it is that mathematics comes from.

1384
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,060
I mean, this is really a philosophical question,

1385
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:46,060
but think about it.

1386
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:48,060
If evolution...

1387
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:52,060
Once evolution discovers a voltage-gated ion channel,

1388
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:54,060
what you have there is a voltage-gated ion conductance,

1389
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:56,060
which is basically a transistor.

1390
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:58,060
If you have a couple of transistors, you can make a logic gate.

1391
00:58:58,060 --> 00:59:00,060
Once you make a logic gate,

1392
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:02,060
you end up with a truth table that tells you

1393
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:04,060
how information is processed by that logic gate.

1394
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:06,060
You didn't have to evolve that truth table.

1395
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:08,060
The truth table is given to you for free,

1396
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:10,060
including things like the fact

1397
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:12,060
that the NAND gate is universal

1398
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:14,060
and various other cool computational properties.

1399
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:16,060
All of that you get for free.

1400
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:18,060
And you don't have to evolve it.

1401
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:20,060
You get it from wherever it is that the laws of

1402
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:22,060
computation, the laws of mathematics,

1403
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:24,060
the same way that if evolution discovers

1404
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,060
two angles of the correct triangle,

1405
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:28,060
it doesn't need to look for the third.

1406
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:30,060
It can save all that time.

1407
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:32,060
You know what the third is going to be.

1408
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:34,060
So there are all of these interesting free lunches,

1409
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:36,060
in a sense, that evolution gets to exploit.

1410
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:38,060
And I don't know where they come from.

1411
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:40,060
Plato and Pythagoras

1412
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:42,060
thought that they come from this platonic space

1413
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:44,060
of universal facts

1414
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:46,060
that exist separately from the physical world.

1415
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:48,060
That's as good an answer as any at this point.

1416
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:52,060
Okay, we have many questions.

1417
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:54,060
So let's just keep the answers a little

1418
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:56,060
so we can get everyone here.

1419
00:59:58,060 --> 01:00:00,060
Hi, my name is Angeline.

1420
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:02,060
I'm currently studying neuroscience

1421
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:04,060
at Columbia and

1422
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:06,060
I want to know

1423
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:08,060
I'd like to know what you think about

1424
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:10,060
evolution as a mechanism

1425
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:12,060
of design.

1426
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:14,060
For example,

1427
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:16,060
evolving a bot

1428
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:18,060
like a bio bot

1429
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:20,060
instead of designing it

1430
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:22,060
or both designing

1431
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:24,060
and evolving it

1432
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:26,060
and

1433
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:28,060
would you edit

1434
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:30,060
hox genes?

1435
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:32,060
Would you take advantage of epigenetics?

1436
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:34,060
And also

1437
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:38,060
you sort of preempted this

1438
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:40,060
with your last answer.

1439
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:42,060
What do you think

1440
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:46,060
how do you think we can take advantage

1441
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:48,060
of the vast computing potential

1442
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:50,060
embodied in biological components

1443
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:52,060
like membranes,

1444
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:54,060
like as you just remarked

1445
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:56,060
like logic gates

1446
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:58,060
and ion voltage control

1447
01:00:58,060 --> 01:01:00,060
and voltage controlled ion channels

1448
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:02,060
are basically the same thing

1449
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:04,060
and there is a potential to program that.

1450
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:06,060
Yeah.

1451
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:08,060
Okay, so there was a lot there

1452
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:10,060
and I guess I was asked to keep my answer short

1453
01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:12,060
so I'll do my best and just pick

1454
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:14,060
one of the things you said.

1455
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:16,060
So we are doing

1456
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:18,060
a lot of work in programming both our xenobots

1457
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:20,060
which are the frog version and the enthrobots

1458
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:22,060
which are the human version.

1459
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:24,060
We are not touching the hox genes.

1460
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:26,060
We are not touching any of that stuff.

1461
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:28,060
We are learning to

1462
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:30,060
give them stimuli

1463
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:32,060
and take advantage of the cell's natural

1464
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:34,060
solving capacities.

1465
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:36,060
We are training cells with rewards and punishments.

1466
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:38,060
We are trying to understand

1467
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:40,060
how they interpret various signals

1468
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:42,060
that cause them to acquire

1469
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:44,060
different shapes and functions

1470
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:46,060
and we're trying to communicate that to the cells

1471
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:48,060
and let them figure out

1472
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:50,060
all the downstream molecular steps

1473
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:52,060
that need to happen

1474
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:54,060
to make it come through.

1475
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:56,060
The thing with evolution

1476
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:58,060
I'll just say one quick thing about evolution

1477
01:01:58,060 --> 01:02:00,060
which is that I think evolution works

1478
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:02,060
completely differently

1479
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:04,060
within a genital medium like this

1480
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:06,060
that is able to solve problems

1481
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:08,060
than it does with the standard story

1482
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:10,060
of evolution

1483
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:12,060
like over a passive medium

1484
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:14,060
where the genotype determines the phenotype.

1485
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:16,060
That middle software layer

1486
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:18,060
that morphogenetic plasticity

1487
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:20,060
that allows it to solve problems

1488
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:22,060
makes evolution or dynamics completely different

1489
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:24,060
because selection

1490
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:26,060
has a hard time seeing actual genomes

1491
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:28,060
than what it sees is the outcome

1492
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:30,060
where you end up selecting for competency

1493
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:32,060
not for actually better genomes

1494
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:34,060
and that's an intelligence ratchet

1495
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:36,060
that goes all the way from

1496
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:38,060
developmental mechanisms all the way up

1497
01:02:38,060 --> 01:02:40,060
I think to behavioral intelligence.

1498
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:46,060
Thank you for the talk.

1499
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:48,060
I was wondering

1500
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:50,060
if you consider like

1501
01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:52,060
moving the eye of the tadpole

1502
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:54,060
from where it normally is to the leg

1503
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:56,060
as a deviation from the norm

1504
01:02:56,060 --> 01:02:58,060
of deviations that can be handled

1505
01:02:58,060 --> 01:03:00,060
before the mechanisms just break down

1506
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:02,060
and what's that threshold look like

1507
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:04,060
if there is one?

1508
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:06,060
We've never reached a threshold

1509
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:08,060
I think that

1510
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:10,060
I don't think there's

1511
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:12,060
any kind of a threshold in that sense

1512
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:14,060
you can certainly overwhelm

1513
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:16,060
metabolically you can overwhelm the system

1514
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:18,060
it needs a certain amount of energy

1515
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:20,060
just to undergo morphogenesis

1516
01:03:20,060 --> 01:03:22,060
and of course

1517
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:24,060
that plasticity is not unlimited

1518
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:26,060
there are many things you can do to screw it up

1519
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:28,060
so that it cannot fix itself

1520
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:30,060
so birth defects are a thing

1521
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:32,060
and that's because these are not infallible pathways

1522
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:34,060
they adapt to a huge number of interventions

1523
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:36,060
but of course it's not unlimited

1524
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:38,060
so I think the limitation

1525
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:40,060
is

1526
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:42,060
it's not the number of things

1527
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:44,060
things you change it's the kind of things

1528
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:46,060
and whether or not you've broken the system's ability

1529
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:48,060
to remember what the right shape is

1530
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:50,060
and then act on it

1531
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:56,060
Hi Michael

1532
01:03:56,060 --> 01:03:58,060
Fascinating topic, thank you so much

1533
01:03:58,060 --> 01:04:00,060
so

1534
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:02,060
what I would like to better understand is

1535
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:04,060
how do you think that such complex information

1536
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:06,060
as the performance

1537
01:04:06,060 --> 01:04:08,060
of a task

1538
01:04:08,060 --> 01:04:10,060
can be encoded outside of the nervous system

1539
01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:12,060
since

1540
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:14,060
in the nervous system we have synapses

1541
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:16,060
and the fundamentals

1542
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:18,060
of learning and memory

1543
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:20,060
it's synaptic plasticity

1544
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:22,060
the potential and depression

1545
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:24,060
of synapses

1546
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:26,060
so how do you think that such complex information

1547
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:28,060
can be encoded

1548
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:30,060
and modulated

1549
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:32,060
through simply ion channels that don't have

1550
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:34,060
synapses between them

1551
01:04:34,060 --> 01:04:36,060
to communicate information

1552
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:38,060
well okay a few things

1553
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:40,060
first of all I'm not suggesting that behavioral information

1554
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:42,060
it relies entirely on ion channels

1555
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:44,060
that's not what I've said

1556
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:46,060
but they do actually cells

1557
01:04:46,060 --> 01:04:48,060
non-neural cells do have electrical synapses

1558
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:50,060
between them, gap junctions

1559
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:52,060
do store state and things like that

1560
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:54,060
but overall

1561
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:56,060
the story and I know this is the standard

1562
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:58,060
story of neuroscience that it's this

1563
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:00,060
synaptic plasticity and LTP and so on

1564
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:02,060
that story, not from my work

1565
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:04,060
but from lots of other people's work

1566
01:05:04,060 --> 01:05:06,060
that story is significantly cracking

1567
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:08,060
at this point and I would recommend

1568
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:10,060
the work of Sam Gershman

1569
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:12,060
Randy Gallo still

1570
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:14,060
David Glansman

1571
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:16,060
to look at some alternatives because

1572
01:05:16,060 --> 01:05:18,060
I don't think that's

1573
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:20,060
many people no longer think that that's the entire

1574
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:22,060
story and overall

1575
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:24,060
if I had to guess I think that

1576
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:26,060
the vast majority of that machinery

1577
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:28,060
that you're talking about is not actually for storing

1578
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:30,060
memories I think it's for interpreting them

1579
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:32,060
and I think that there are numerous

1580
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:34,060
substrates within cells

1581
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:36,060
neural and non-neural that basically act

1582
01:05:36,060 --> 01:05:38,060
like a

1583
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:40,060
almost like a reservoir computing scenario

1584
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:42,060
but a lot of the

1585
01:05:42,060 --> 01:05:44,060
actual degrees of freedom are in chemical

1586
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:46,060
systems they're not necessarily

1587
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:48,060
synaptic

1588
01:05:48,060 --> 01:05:50,060
and the neural

1589
01:05:50,060 --> 01:05:52,060
networks are actually there to try to interpret it

1590
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:54,060
on the fly so that's

1591
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:56,060
a long conversation

1592
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:58,060
to have but look up some of those papers and you'll see

1593
01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:00,060
this is not my idea

1594
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:02,060
this has been around for some decades now

1595
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:08,060
Just keep your questions

1596
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:10,060
and answers like we have like 10 more

1597
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:12,060
questions so

1598
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:14,060
Thank you so much for the talk

1599
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:16,060
I'm curious

1600
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:18,060
on your thoughts about

1601
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:20,060
whether this electrical information

1602
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:22,060
can be accessible

1603
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:24,060
in higher order cognition and humans

1604
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:26,060
might be in conscious perception

1605
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:28,060
and other organisms that might look a little

1606
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:30,060
different

1607
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:32,060
Yeah I mean if I understood correctly

1608
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:34,060
that's the project of neural

1609
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:36,060
decoding so lots of neuroscientists

1610
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:38,060
work on this idea of reading out

1611
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:40,060
electrical information out of

1612
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:42,060
mammalian brains or including

1613
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:44,060
human brains to try and understand what the person

1614
01:06:44,060 --> 01:06:46,060
is thinking

1615
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:52,060
Hi thanks for the talk I'm

1616
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:54,060
I'm wondering when you say

1617
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:56,060
all intelligence is collective intelligence

1618
01:06:56,060 --> 01:06:58,060
is there a sort of a principal

1619
01:06:58,060 --> 01:07:00,060
argument for that like can we imagine

1620
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:02,060
intelligences that we haven't

1621
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:04,060
discovered that could not be

1622
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:06,060
collective like why are all

1623
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:08,060
intelligences collective

1624
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:10,060
Well

1625
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:12,060
as far as we know

1626
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:14,060
certainly on earth

1627
01:07:14,060 --> 01:07:16,060
every intelligence is made

1628
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:18,060
of parts

1629
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:20,060
I cannot I mean maybe somebody has

1630
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:22,060
better imagination than me but I cannot imagine

1631
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:24,060
a truly

1632
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:26,060
sort of

1633
01:07:26,060 --> 01:07:28,060
homogenous monadic

1634
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:30,060
single

1635
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:32,060
single object that is not made of

1636
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:34,060
parts that can change and that function relative

1637
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:36,060
to each other and so on that could then

1638
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:38,060
learn and

1639
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:40,060
do the kinds of things we expect of intelligence

1640
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:42,060
if it doesn't have internal parts that can change

1641
01:07:42,060 --> 01:07:44,060
state how is it learning anything

1642
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:46,060
right it's not I just can't imagine

1643
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:48,060
how you could possibly have a

1644
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:50,060
intelligence that is

1645
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:52,060
one indivisible thing that does not have

1646
01:07:52,060 --> 01:07:54,060
internal states that can change every intelligence

1647
01:07:54,060 --> 01:07:56,060
that we've ever seen every piece of

1648
01:07:56,060 --> 01:07:58,060
active matter and

1649
01:07:58,060 --> 01:08:00,060
intelligent living

1650
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:02,060
thing that we've ever seen is composed of parts

1651
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:04,060
composed of parts composed of parts

1652
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:06,060
I just don't see how it would be

1653
01:08:06,060 --> 01:08:08,060
otherwise

1654
01:08:10,060 --> 01:08:12,060
good

1655
01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:16,060
hi yeah great talk

1656
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:18,060
so I was curious about

1657
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:20,060
have you done RNA

1658
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:22,060
seek before and after for example

1659
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:24,060
in that frog example

1660
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:26,060
I'm curious if there are any

1661
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:28,060
transcriptomic changes that you were able to see and

1662
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:30,060
if so

1663
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:32,060
what are your thoughts on oncogenesis

1664
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:34,060
or oncogene activation

1665
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:36,060
yeah we absolutely

1666
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:38,060
we've done tons of RNA seek there are massive

1667
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:40,060
transcriptional

1668
01:08:40,060 --> 01:08:42,060
remodeling events that happen after the kinds of things

1669
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:44,060
that we do also naturally so

1670
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:46,060
xenobots have a very different transcriptome from

1671
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:48,060
frog embryos, anthropobots have an extremely

1672
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:50,060
different transcriptome from

1673
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:52,060
normal human

1674
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:54,060
from the tissue that they came from

1675
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:56,060
even though there are no genetic changes

1676
01:08:56,060 --> 01:08:58,060
no weird nanomaterials, no drugs, no trans genes

1677
01:08:58,060 --> 01:09:00,060
no certain synthetic circuits

1678
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:02,060
so yeah massive

1679
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:04,060
massive changes and as far as oncogenes

1680
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:06,060
the story that I didn't tell you is that

1681
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:10,060
there's a whole

1682
01:09:10,060 --> 01:09:12,060
way to look at cancer as a kind of

1683
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:14,060
dissociative identity disorder of this collective intelligence

1684
01:09:14,060 --> 01:09:16,060
and what that means is that you can actually address it

1685
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:18,060
not by trying to kill the cells

1686
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:20,060
but by trying to reconnect them back

1687
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:22,060
into the

1688
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:24,060
into the electrical networks and so what we do

1689
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:26,060
is we inject human oncogenes

1690
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:28,060
like K-RAS mutations and so on

1691
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:30,060
into these embryos normally they make

1692
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:32,060
tumors but if we then

1693
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:34,060
manage the electrical connectivity correctly

1694
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:36,060
even though the oncoprotein is blazingly

1695
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:38,060
expressed you don't get tumors you get

1696
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:40,060
perfectly healthy tissue with cells that are

1697
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:42,060
participating in the network activity

1698
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:44,060
and doing what they're supposed to do so there is

1699
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:46,060
there is a cancer therapeutic story

1700
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:48,060
here as well

1701
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:52,060
Hello Michael great talk

1702
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:54,060
thank you very much so I'm a neurosurgeon

1703
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:56,060
I have an interesting

1704
01:09:56,060 --> 01:09:58,060
observation that you might find

1705
01:09:58,060 --> 01:10:00,060
cool too

1706
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:02,060
so we have had

1707
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:04,060
patients that we operate on

1708
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:06,060
say lose some function

1709
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:08,060
speech and then

1710
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:10,060
rehabilitate after six months they are back

1711
01:10:10,060 --> 01:10:12,060
they regain their speech back

1712
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:14,060
and when we operate

1713
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:16,060
on the same patient again

1714
01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:18,060
the same spot where we lost

1715
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:20,060
speech last time

1716
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:22,060
is completely

1717
01:10:22,060 --> 01:10:24,060
rejectable and no function change occurs

1718
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:26,060
so this

1719
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:28,060
this is very rare

1720
01:10:28,060 --> 01:10:30,060
I didn't I saw

1721
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:32,060
this kind of phenomena happen three or four times

1722
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:34,060
but I was

1723
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:36,060
and I'm not familiar

1724
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:38,060
with your field

1725
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:40,060
but is there a paper

1726
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:42,060
you can direct us something

1727
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:44,060
that

1728
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:46,060
describes what you are describing here

1729
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:48,060
the morpho memory and

1730
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:50,060
the regular memory

1731
01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:52,060
how do they work in the human brains

1732
01:10:52,060 --> 01:10:54,060
well

1733
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:56,060
okay there are lots of papers

1734
01:10:56,060 --> 01:10:58,060
how they work in human brains

1735
01:10:58,060 --> 01:11:00,060
is very unclear because obviously

1736
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:02,060
experiments are really hard

1737
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:04,060
for ethical reasons you can't do this

1738
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:06,060
in regular humans there is some clinical data

1739
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:08,060
drop me an email

1740
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:10,060
michael.levin at tufts.edu

1741
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:12,060
send me an email and I will

1742
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:14,060
shoot you some reprints of what we have

1743
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:20,060
Hi professor what do you see is the biggest

1744
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:22,060
problem we need to solve before

1745
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:24,060
using this to program

1746
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:26,060
organisms

1747
01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:28,060
the biggest problem is

1748
01:11:28,060 --> 01:11:30,060
conceptual the biggest problem

1749
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:32,060
is developing an

1750
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:34,060
understanding of

1751
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:36,060
how we are going to

1752
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:38,060
recognize and

1753
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:40,060
communicate with a

1754
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:42,060
collective intelligence

1755
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:44,060
in the sense that even

1756
01:11:44,060 --> 01:11:46,060
we've done experiments with gene

1757
01:11:46,060 --> 01:11:48,060
even gene regulatory networks

1758
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:50,060
without the rest of the cell

1759
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:52,060
without changing promoters

1760
01:11:52,060 --> 01:11:54,060
without any of that just by their

1761
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:56,060
dynamical properties have

1762
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:58,060
6 different kinds of memory that they can do

1763
01:11:58,060 --> 01:12:00,060
including pavlovian conditioning

1764
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:02,060
just grns on their own

1765
01:12:02,060 --> 01:12:04,060
the ability to recognize

1766
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:06,060
that kind of property

1767
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:08,060
and to learn to engineer with an

1768
01:12:08,060 --> 01:12:10,060
agential material not the way we've

1769
01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:12,060
engineered with passive materials

1770
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:14,060
which we've done for millennia

1771
01:12:14,060 --> 01:12:16,060
but a material with an agenda

1772
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:18,060
of goals and competencies

1773
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:20,060
and problem solving skills

1774
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:22,060
it's a completely different way of engineering

1775
01:12:22,060 --> 01:12:24,060
it's a communication and a collaboration

1776
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:26,060
with your material it's not the kind of

1777
01:12:26,060 --> 01:12:28,060
micromanaging that we've been doing

1778
01:12:28,060 --> 01:12:30,060
since the beginning of the scientific enterprise

1779
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:32,060
so those issues

1780
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:34,060
are the biggest barrier

1781
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:40,060
Thanks

1782
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:42,060
I notice you guys mostly use endothelial

1783
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:44,060
or epithelial tissues for like the xenobots

1784
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:46,060
and from different species as well

1785
01:12:46,060 --> 01:12:48,060
is that just sort of purely methodological

1786
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:50,060
opportunism or is there like a relationship

1787
01:12:50,060 --> 01:12:52,060
between behavioral plasticity

1788
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:54,060
and the characteristic time scale

1789
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:56,060
at which they divide it die and so on

1790
01:12:56,060 --> 01:12:58,060
yeah interesting

1791
01:12:58,060 --> 01:13:00,060
we've done everything

1792
01:13:00,060 --> 01:13:02,060
we've done mesodermendoderm

1793
01:13:02,060 --> 01:13:04,060
we've done human mesenchymal stem cells

1794
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:06,060
the reason the bots are epithelial

1795
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:08,060
is because

1796
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:10,060
those are the tissues that are ciliated

1797
01:13:10,060 --> 01:13:12,060
and they have a little motile cilia

1798
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:14,060
and that behavior

1799
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:16,060
that allows them to swim

1800
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:18,060
and to have visible behavior

1801
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:20,060
now I also think that

1802
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:22,060
there are many interesting behaviors that happen

1803
01:13:22,060 --> 01:13:24,060
in physiological and transcriptional spaces

1804
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:26,060
but for our first outing of this stuff

1805
01:13:26,060 --> 01:13:28,060
it was important to have behaviors

1806
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:30,060
that people can see and really recognize as behaviors

1807
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:32,060
so for that you need them to be motile

1808
01:13:32,060 --> 01:13:34,060
which means cilia

1809
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:36,060
which means epithelium

1810
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:38,060
Thanks

1811
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:44,060
Thanks for the talk I really enjoyed it

1812
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:46,060
I had a sort of question about

1813
01:13:46,060 --> 01:13:48,060
the role of you mentioned membranes

1814
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:50,060
were used to sort of predict the next

1815
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:52,060
downstream series of events and

1816
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:54,060
intercellular events that contribute to the gross

1817
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:56,060
development what do you think of epigenetics

1818
01:13:56,060 --> 01:13:58,060
and how you would sort of encode that

1819
01:13:58,060 --> 01:14:00,060
in the computational model

1820
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:02,060
and sort of what those next steps are

1821
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:04,060
like methylation, alkylation

1822
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:06,060
all those different types of things because

1823
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:08,060
you accounted for membranes but not I guess

1824
01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:10,060
those types of changes and I guess more

1825
01:14:10,060 --> 01:14:12,060
basically how do you account

1826
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:14,060
to encode those as

1827
01:14:14,060 --> 01:14:16,060
next steps that a computational model

1828
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:18,060
might predict or even downstream

1829
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:20,060
Yeah we have them in our model

1830
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:22,060
so we know there are

1831
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:24,060
acetylation and methylation events that are downstream

1832
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:26,060
of the things we do

1833
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:28,060
it's there

1834
01:14:28,060 --> 01:14:30,060
by itself it doesn't really add much

1835
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:32,060
all of the

1836
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:34,060
the kind of high level decisions

1837
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:36,060
about what's going to happen

1838
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:38,060
are made at least as far as we've

1839
01:14:38,060 --> 01:14:40,060
been able to see now they're made

1840
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:42,060
at that electrophysiological level

1841
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:44,060
all the gene expression changes

1842
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:46,060
direct or indirect through chromatin

1843
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:48,060
modification or downstream

1844
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:50,060
yeah they're there you can model them

1845
01:14:50,060 --> 01:14:52,060
but they're not

1846
01:14:52,060 --> 01:14:54,060
they're not a great

1847
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:56,060
target for modification

1848
01:14:56,060 --> 01:14:58,060
you know if you want

1849
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:00,060
there's certain things that you can do that way

1850
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:02,060
but typically if you want to make these large scale

1851
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:04,060
changes you're much better off doing

1852
01:15:04,060 --> 01:15:06,060
it as high on that control

1853
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:08,060
hierarchy as you can

1854
01:15:08,060 --> 01:15:10,060
by the time you get down to the chromatin modification

1855
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:12,060
you are having to micromanage a lot

1856
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:14,060
of things to get what you want

1857
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:22,060
Hi

1858
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:24,060
thank you for your talk

1859
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:26,060
I was really interested in the conditions

1860
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:28,060
of this kind of initial bioelectrical

1861
01:15:28,060 --> 01:15:30,060
field

1862
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:32,060
you showed several examples

1863
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:34,060
of for example cells

1864
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:36,060
creating

1865
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:38,060
like sending bioelectrical

1866
01:15:38,060 --> 01:15:40,060
signals amongst each other

1867
01:15:40,060 --> 01:15:42,060
in order to stimulate growth in a certain way

1868
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:44,060
I'm wondering

1869
01:15:44,060 --> 01:15:46,060
when it came to maybe like the first

1870
01:15:46,060 --> 01:15:48,060
organisms or organisms in a vacuum

1871
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:50,060
are we

1872
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:52,060
kind of sending out certain frequencies

1873
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:54,060
or electrical

1874
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:56,060
stimuli

1875
01:15:56,060 --> 01:15:58,060
in order to simulate that

1876
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:00,060
or what were those types of kind of

1877
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:02,060
initial field conditions

1878
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:04,060
Yeah, good question

1879
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:06,060
I mean we are

1880
01:16:06,060 --> 01:16:08,060
living cells

1881
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:10,060
put out all kinds of things across the electromagnetic

1882
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:12,060
spectrum

1883
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:14,060
ultra weak photon emission

1884
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:16,060
all kinds of AC

1885
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:18,060
weak magnetic

1886
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:20,060
kinds of things

1887
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:22,060
I don't study any of that

1888
01:16:22,060 --> 01:16:24,060
so I have no idea really

1889
01:16:24,060 --> 01:16:26,060
what the implications that would be

1890
01:16:26,060 --> 01:16:28,060
everything that I've shown you was

1891
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:30,060
purely electrical there's no magnetic component

1892
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:32,060
there's no waves

1893
01:16:32,060 --> 01:16:34,060
this is purely electrical and it propagates

1894
01:16:34,060 --> 01:16:36,060
through water so

1895
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:38,060
the stuff that I showed you doesn't really

1896
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:40,060
work through air

1897
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:42,060
but having said that it is true

1898
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:44,060
that living things do emit

1899
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:46,060
electromagnetic radiation but I don't think

1900
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:48,060
we know what it does

1901
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:50,060
Thanks

1902
01:16:50,060 --> 01:16:52,060
Alright, last question

1903
01:16:54,060 --> 01:16:56,060
Thank you so much for this talk

1904
01:16:56,060 --> 01:16:58,060
just a quick question

1905
01:16:58,060 --> 01:17:00,060
about like because I guess you can

1906
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:02,060
kind of call it

1907
01:17:02,060 --> 01:17:04,060
like a programming type of question

1908
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:06,060
how would you

1909
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:08,060
describe the type of bugs

1910
01:17:08,060 --> 01:17:10,060
that you encounter so to speak

1911
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:12,060
in this situation so let's say you want to create

1912
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:14,060
a worm with two heads

1913
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:16,060
and the outcome is just different than what you expect

1914
01:17:16,060 --> 01:17:18,060
like how do you, first of all

1915
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:20,060
I'm guessing you've seen that in a second

1916
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:22,060
how do you deal with quote unquote debugging that

1917
01:17:22,060 --> 01:17:24,060
Yeah, great

1918
01:17:24,060 --> 01:17:26,060
the biggest issue here

1919
01:17:26,060 --> 01:17:28,060
is that you have to think

1920
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:30,060
completely differently than you do

1921
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:32,060
with regular programming because in regular

1922
01:17:32,060 --> 01:17:34,060
programming

1923
01:17:34,060 --> 01:17:36,060
at least most of the time

1924
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:38,060
you're dealing with an obedient passive

1925
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:40,060
medium so when you have a command

1926
01:17:40,060 --> 01:17:42,060
whatever that command may be

1927
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:44,060
you are pretty much guaranteed that

1928
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:46,060
the hardware is going to carry it out

1929
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:48,060
it may be the right command, maybe the wrong command

1930
01:17:48,060 --> 01:17:50,060
but when you say add these two numbers

1931
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:52,060
if your hardware

1932
01:17:52,060 --> 01:17:54,060
is not actually going to do it then

1933
01:17:54,060 --> 01:17:56,060
you don't have a good computer right

1934
01:17:56,060 --> 01:17:58,060
the whole point of hardware

1935
01:17:58,060 --> 01:18:00,060
is to isolate those layers so that

1936
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:02,060
at the higher level you don't need to worry about

1937
01:18:02,060 --> 01:18:04,060
where the electrons are going you can assume

1938
01:18:04,060 --> 01:18:06,060
that the chip is doing what it needs to do

1939
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:08,060
and it's going to get carried out

1940
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:10,060
biology isn't like that at all so what's happening here

1941
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:12,060
is that every level has its own agenda

1942
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:14,060
so when you are providing certain signals

1943
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:16,060
what you end up with are targets that

1944
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:18,060
either aren't paying attention

1945
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:20,060
or they are paying attention and they refuse

1946
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:22,060
or they actually fight you on it

1947
01:18:22,060 --> 01:18:24,060
are they going to do something different

1948
01:18:24,060 --> 01:18:26,060
or they have some other thing that they want to do

1949
01:18:26,060 --> 01:18:28,060
and this happens at every level

1950
01:18:28,060 --> 01:18:30,060
it's not just behavioral

1951
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:32,060
scientists know about this because

1952
01:18:32,060 --> 01:18:34,060
it's really hard to do experiments

1953
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:36,060
because of individuality cells do this too

1954
01:18:36,060 --> 01:18:38,060
so you're dealing with a material that is not

1955
01:18:38,060 --> 01:18:40,060
a passive material that has

1956
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:42,060
well separated levels

1957
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:44,060
of abstraction where each

1958
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:46,060
level can depend on the bottom level to be

1959
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:48,060
perfectly obedient they are all pursuing

1960
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:50,060
their own agendas they are cooperating

1961
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:52,060
communicating with each other

1962
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:54,060
interpreting each other

1963
01:18:54,060 --> 01:18:56,060
the computational paradigm that

1964
01:18:56,060 --> 01:18:58,060
Josh Bangar and I have come up with

1965
01:18:58,060 --> 01:19:00,060
is called polycomputing

1966
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:02,060
and it's simply the idea that

1967
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:04,060
you have a huge number of

1968
01:19:04,060 --> 01:19:06,060
coexisting

1969
01:19:06,060 --> 01:19:08,060
interpenetrating agents which are all

1970
01:19:08,060 --> 01:19:10,060
interpreting and hacking each other in different ways

1971
01:19:10,060 --> 01:19:12,060
so there's not a single

1972
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:14,060
interpretation of what an event is actually

1973
01:19:14,060 --> 01:19:16,060
computing in our computing architectures

1974
01:19:16,060 --> 01:19:18,060
we all agree when there's an AND gate

1975
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:20,060
this is this set of physical events that's an AND gate

1976
01:19:20,060 --> 01:19:22,060
it's computing it in biology you have

1977
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:24,060
lots of little

1978
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:26,060
observers inside the cells and the tissues

1979
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:28,060
that are all

1980
01:19:28,060 --> 01:19:30,060
interpreting these events as completely

1981
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:32,060
different computations and we as a third person

1982
01:19:32,060 --> 01:19:34,060
a sort of third party observer

1983
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:36,060
often have absolutely no clue what they're doing

1984
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:38,060
and that's really hard

1985
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:40,060
it's a very different way of programming

1986
01:19:40,060 --> 01:19:42,060
amazing

1987
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:44,060
well

1988
01:19:44,060 --> 01:19:46,060
what an amazing talk and

1989
01:19:46,060 --> 01:19:48,060
thank you so much for us give

1990
01:19:48,060 --> 01:19:50,060
another round of applause

1991
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:52,060
thank you so much great questions

1992
01:19:52,060 --> 01:19:54,060
I really enjoyed the discussion

1993
01:19:54,060 --> 01:19:56,060
awesome

1994
01:19:56,060 --> 01:19:58,060
okay now

1995
01:19:58,060 --> 01:20:00,060
we will also talk a little bit about

1996
01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:02,060
decentralized science

1997
01:20:02,060 --> 01:20:04,060
and I'll follow up

1998
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:06,060
you're welcome to stay or whatever is good

1999
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:08,060
so

2000
01:20:08,060 --> 01:20:10,060
let me share this tab here

2001
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:12,060
thanks everybody I've got to run

2002
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:14,060
for the long day

2003
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:16,060
thank you

2004
01:20:16,060 --> 01:20:18,060
thank you so much

2005
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:20,060
great discussion

2006
01:20:20,060 --> 01:20:22,060
okay

2007
01:20:22,060 --> 01:20:24,060
so

2008
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:26,060
let me switch over here

2009
01:20:26,060 --> 01:20:28,060
so

2010
01:20:28,060 --> 01:20:30,060
oh yeah so first off

2011
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:32,060
decentralized science is important so the first

2012
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:34,060
part of decentralized science is attracting more people

2013
01:20:34,060 --> 01:20:36,060
so if you enjoyed this event

2014
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:38,060
or you wanted to share with

2015
01:20:38,060 --> 01:20:40,060
another person make sure to

2016
01:20:40,060 --> 01:20:42,060
and make sure to post it it really helps

2017
01:20:42,060 --> 01:20:44,060
us you can take out your phone

2018
01:20:44,060 --> 01:20:46,060
I hate to be annoying about it

2019
01:20:46,060 --> 01:20:48,060
but I want you to take out your phone and take a picture

2020
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:50,060
and send it out to other people

2021
01:20:50,060 --> 01:20:52,060
it seems weird now

2022
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:54,060
but

2023
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:56,060
it helps

2024
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:58,060
we have information about

2025
01:20:58,060 --> 01:21:00,060
I'm going to give you information on our neko

2026
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:02,060
first

2027
01:21:02,060 --> 01:21:04,060
we want to thank the people who

2028
01:21:04,060 --> 01:21:06,060
gave us this space today which is alchemy

2029
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:08,060
and they are

2030
01:21:08,060 --> 01:21:10,060
the most reliable way to build web3 apps

2031
01:21:10,060 --> 01:21:12,060
specifically

2032
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:14,060
a keel college friend

2033
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:16,060
who is very kind to

2034
01:21:16,060 --> 01:21:18,060
give us the space

2035
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:20,060
don't need the space

2036
01:21:20,060 --> 01:21:22,060
so this is the dci nyc community

2037
01:21:22,060 --> 01:21:24,060
we have lots and lots of speakers

2038
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:26,060
we've had this is the 14th one we've done

2039
01:21:26,060 --> 01:21:28,060
we've had

2040
01:21:28,060 --> 01:21:30,060
people on mushrooms

2041
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:32,060
and blinded studies and b's

2042
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:34,060
and ai and nft's

2043
01:21:34,060 --> 01:21:36,060
all sorts of things

2044
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:38,060
and we have another one

2045
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:40,060
we have a new community

2046
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:42,060
now people take out their phone

2047
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:44,060
we have a telegram group

2048
01:21:44,060 --> 01:21:46,060
so you can stay in touch

2049
01:21:46,060 --> 01:21:48,060
after the event with each other

2050
01:21:50,060 --> 01:21:52,060
just giving another hint here

2051
01:21:52,060 --> 01:21:54,060
if you have your phone out now

2052
01:21:54,060 --> 01:21:56,060
okay

2053
01:21:56,060 --> 01:21:58,060
we have a website so dci.nyc

2054
01:21:58,060 --> 01:22:00,060
we have all our previous events

2055
01:22:00,060 --> 01:22:02,060
there we have the videos

2056
01:22:02,060 --> 01:22:04,060
we record everything we post online

2057
01:22:04,060 --> 01:22:06,060
we have swag

2058
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:08,060
other things like that

2059
01:22:08,060 --> 01:22:10,060
can you go back to the telegram?

2060
01:22:10,060 --> 01:22:12,060
oh yeah

2061
01:22:16,060 --> 01:22:18,060
cool

2062
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:20,060
okay

2063
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:22,060
this is our next event on august 1st

2064
01:22:22,060 --> 01:22:24,060
it's going to be amazing

2065
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:26,060
there is going to be

2066
01:22:26,060 --> 01:22:28,060
it's on this guy who's like doing this like

2067
01:22:28,060 --> 01:22:30,060
he's like

2068
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:32,060
supersize me remember that movie with like mcdonald's

2069
01:22:32,060 --> 01:22:34,060
and

2070
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:36,060
he's going to be doing like supersize

2071
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:38,060
supersize me but with like wearables

2072
01:22:38,060 --> 01:22:40,060
it's going to be really cool

2073
01:22:40,060 --> 01:22:42,060
I spoke with him a few times

2074
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:44,060
and he's an interesting fellow

2075
01:22:44,060 --> 01:22:46,060
and he's developing like a new type of wearable

2076
01:22:46,060 --> 01:22:48,060
for your toilet

2077
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:50,060
and he's trying to destroy

2078
01:22:50,060 --> 01:22:52,060
his gut right now and then heal it

2079
01:22:52,060 --> 01:22:54,060
and then track the process

2080
01:22:54,060 --> 01:22:56,060
and we're going to be the first ones to

2081
01:22:56,060 --> 01:22:58,060
hear about his poo

2082
01:22:58,060 --> 01:23:00,060
oh

2083
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:04,060
this is one thing we're trying to do more of

2084
01:23:04,060 --> 01:23:06,060
like having like a volunteer group

2085
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:08,060
right now it's

2086
01:23:08,060 --> 01:23:10,060
sort of like a

2087
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:12,060
like a skeleton crew that's doing this

2088
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:14,060
oh thank you brian for helping

2089
01:23:14,060 --> 01:23:16,060
tonight thank you

2090
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:20,060
I love as well

2091
01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:22,060
problems on the video

2092
01:23:24,060 --> 01:23:26,060
and brian on the code also

2093
01:23:26,060 --> 01:23:28,060
and so

2094
01:23:28,060 --> 01:23:30,060
if you're interested in

2095
01:23:30,060 --> 01:23:32,060
volunteering

2096
01:23:32,060 --> 01:23:34,060
for the next event here

2097
01:23:34,060 --> 01:23:36,060
we'll get dinner, we'll assign roles

2098
01:23:36,060 --> 01:23:38,060
and you can help out the part more part of the crew

2099
01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:40,060
and pick speakers

2100
01:23:40,060 --> 01:23:42,060
what was it

2101
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:46,060
I forgot to update this slide

2102
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:50,060
okay so now I'm going to talk about

2103
01:23:50,060 --> 01:23:52,060
like why is

2104
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:54,060
what is decentralized

2105
01:23:54,060 --> 01:23:56,060
I wanted to do this talk before

2106
01:23:56,060 --> 01:23:58,060
but he had a

2107
01:23:58,060 --> 01:24:00,060
professor 11 so we'll do this talk after

2108
01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:02,060
and I wanted to say

2109
01:24:02,060 --> 01:24:04,060
why is it important as

2110
01:24:04,060 --> 01:24:06,060
a society and as a humanity

2111
01:24:06,060 --> 01:24:08,060
that we like

2112
01:24:08,060 --> 01:24:10,060
decentralize science

2113
01:24:10,060 --> 01:24:12,060
so imagine like

2114
01:24:12,060 --> 01:24:14,060
right now universities

2115
01:24:14,060 --> 01:24:16,060
like science is like hugely beneficial

2116
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:18,060
to humankind

2117
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:20,060
so that's probably one of the best

2118
01:24:20,060 --> 01:24:22,060
metrics of progress

2119
01:24:22,060 --> 01:24:24,060
and right now like a lot of it

2120
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:26,060
are done in like research and development labs

2121
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:28,060
and it's done in

2122
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:30,060
like universities

2123
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:32,060
but the quality of the research

2124
01:24:32,060 --> 01:24:34,060
in these things is all very tightly kept

2125
01:24:34,060 --> 01:24:36,060
it's a secret and also

2126
01:24:36,060 --> 01:24:38,060
that

2127
01:24:38,060 --> 01:24:40,060
sometimes the quality of like

2128
01:24:40,060 --> 01:24:42,060
academic research is really bad

2129
01:24:42,060 --> 01:24:44,060
and it's like not reproducible

2130
01:24:44,060 --> 01:24:46,060
and imagine a world in which

2131
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:48,060
like the internet was like a giant

2132
01:24:48,060 --> 01:24:50,060
lab where people could like

2133
01:24:50,060 --> 01:24:52,060
contribute data to it

2134
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:54,060
and get rewarded for it

2135
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:56,060
and I think that like this is not

2136
01:24:56,060 --> 01:24:58,060
too far off I think like

2137
01:24:58,060 --> 01:25:00,060
universities are you know not as important

2138
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:02,060
as they were 30 years ago

2139
01:25:02,060 --> 01:25:04,060
where is that science and innovation going to happen

2140
01:25:04,060 --> 01:25:06,060
it's going to happen on the internet

2141
01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:08,060
and this is like extremely valuable

2142
01:25:08,060 --> 01:25:10,060
and the people that participate in it

2143
01:25:10,060 --> 01:25:12,060
should get rewarded for it

2144
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:14,060
so with this sort of premise is like

2145
01:25:14,060 --> 01:25:16,060
if you want if you have this as your goal

2146
01:25:16,060 --> 01:25:18,060
what would be the easiest way to do it

2147
01:25:18,060 --> 01:25:20,060
is you would use this blockchain

2148
01:25:20,060 --> 01:25:22,060
instead of just for like

2149
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:24,060
financial incentives or like

2150
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:26,060
swapping tokens and like

2151
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:28,060
you swap some bitcoin for some ethereum on uniswap

2152
01:25:28,060 --> 01:25:30,060
which is cool but like the underlying value

2153
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:32,060
attached to each of the tokens is like

2154
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:34,060
sort of arbitrary whereas if you

2155
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:36,060
like instead use the blockchain

2156
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:38,060
to assign each token

2157
01:25:38,060 --> 01:25:40,060
or assign to a research project or to

2158
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:42,060
intellectual property or to a new drug

2159
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:44,060
or to bio electricity

2160
01:25:44,060 --> 01:25:46,060
and then you allow people to like

2161
01:25:46,060 --> 01:25:48,060
swap those types of tokens

2162
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:50,060
for the IP that's attached to those

2163
01:25:50,060 --> 01:25:52,060
or contribute to a research project

2164
01:25:52,060 --> 01:25:54,060
this could be really cool and

2165
01:25:54,060 --> 01:25:56,060
make new types of projects happen

2166
01:25:56,060 --> 01:25:58,060
and maybe fund things and I want to

2167
01:25:58,060 --> 01:26:00,060
emphasize that like this isn't far off

2168
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:02,060
I don't think that we're that far off

2169
01:26:02,060 --> 01:26:04,060
from this sort of thing existing in the world

2170
01:26:04,060 --> 01:26:06,060
I think it could be within the next like two to five

2171
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:08,060
years I think it's very possible

2172
01:26:08,060 --> 01:26:10,060
and then the other big thing that's changing around

2173
01:26:10,060 --> 01:26:12,060
like why this is possible now

2174
01:26:12,060 --> 01:26:14,060
is like

2175
01:26:14,060 --> 01:26:16,060
AI is like going to be a scientist

2176
01:26:16,060 --> 01:26:18,060
very shortly so the idea that

2177
01:26:18,060 --> 01:26:20,060
you're a PhD student and then you have

2178
01:26:20,060 --> 01:26:22,060
six years of knowledge and four years of

2179
01:26:22,060 --> 01:26:24,060
undergraduate in this very specific

2180
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:26,060
domain is like passe

2181
01:26:26,060 --> 01:26:28,060
and now anyone can be a research

2182
01:26:28,060 --> 01:26:30,060
scientist with just

2183
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:32,060
like access to charge EVT

2184
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:34,060
and you can get up to speed very quickly

2185
01:26:34,060 --> 01:26:36,060
so in this like new decentralized

2186
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:38,060
science thing I think

2187
01:26:38,060 --> 01:26:40,060
it's possible to have like a thousand times

2188
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:42,060
the number of scientists that exist

2189
01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:44,060
today because

2190
01:26:44,060 --> 01:26:46,060
there's a lot of people who aren't part of

2191
01:26:46,060 --> 01:26:48,060
a university who want to become

2192
01:26:48,060 --> 01:26:50,060
like a scientist

2193
01:26:50,060 --> 01:26:52,060
people will be incentivized so that you don't have

2194
01:26:52,060 --> 01:26:54,060
to do it through like

2195
01:26:54,060 --> 01:26:56,060
like you get

2196
01:26:56,060 --> 01:26:58,060
like a crappy salary at a university

2197
01:26:58,060 --> 01:27:00,060
like no one wants that like people want to be

2198
01:27:00,060 --> 01:27:02,060
like incentivized to do really great work

2199
01:27:02,060 --> 01:27:04,060
and so I think

2200
01:27:04,060 --> 01:27:06,060
that this is very possible to have like

2201
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:08,060
wealthy scientists and a lot more of them

2202
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:10,060
and like similar to how like

2203
01:27:10,060 --> 01:27:12,060
maybe like 30 years ago or 40 years ago

2204
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:14,060
like there's only a couple computer programmers

2205
01:27:14,060 --> 01:27:16,060
but then like computers became

2206
01:27:16,060 --> 01:27:18,060
cheaper, GitHub became available

2207
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:20,060
tools became easier to use

2208
01:27:20,060 --> 01:27:22,060
and then there's like everyone is a programmer

2209
01:27:22,060 --> 01:27:24,060
today and I think the same thing is sort of

2210
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:26,060
we're on the cusp of that for

2211
01:27:26,060 --> 01:27:28,060
science so

2212
01:27:28,060 --> 01:27:30,060
um

2213
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:32,060
uh it's like

2214
01:27:32,060 --> 01:27:34,060
like d-science is going to do for science

2215
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:36,060
like it's going to decentralize science but

2216
01:27:36,060 --> 01:27:38,060
how many people know what d-phi is just in general

2217
01:27:38,060 --> 01:27:40,060
decentralized okay a lot

2218
01:27:40,060 --> 01:27:42,060
d-phi is like decentralizing finance

2219
01:27:42,060 --> 01:27:44,060
so that's like the idea of that

2220
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:46,060
instead of like opening a bank account at

2221
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:48,060
Wells Fargo there's probably a lot of people

2222
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:50,060
who can't open a bank account

2223
01:27:50,060 --> 01:27:52,060
who would like to be banked and so

2224
01:27:52,060 --> 01:27:54,060
having like an ethereum wallet

2225
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:56,060
a bitcoin wallet address or an ethereum address

2226
01:27:56,060 --> 01:27:58,060
and allowing them to swap different tokens

2227
01:27:58,060 --> 01:28:00,060
opening this up to a lot more people

2228
01:28:00,060 --> 01:28:02,060
and also remove a lot of the middlemen

2229
01:28:02,060 --> 01:28:04,060
so

2230
01:28:04,060 --> 01:28:06,060
here's a little table I made

2231
01:28:06,060 --> 01:28:08,060
we call this traditional science on the right

2232
01:28:08,060 --> 01:28:10,060
and decentralized science

2233
01:28:10,060 --> 01:28:12,060
on the left and I

2234
01:28:12,060 --> 01:28:14,060
I start off with this is just sort of

2235
01:28:14,060 --> 01:28:16,060
the process of

2236
01:28:16,060 --> 01:28:18,060
um a typical science

2237
01:28:18,060 --> 01:28:20,060
application so

2238
01:28:20,060 --> 01:28:22,060
the first thing is funding so

2239
01:28:22,060 --> 01:28:24,060
I hate funding because like normally

2240
01:28:24,060 --> 01:28:26,060
if you're not getting funded as a scientist

2241
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:28,060
it means like I've never seen like

2242
01:28:28,060 --> 01:28:30,060
a really talented scientist complain about funding

2243
01:28:30,060 --> 01:28:32,060
so it means like something else is wrong

2244
01:28:32,060 --> 01:28:34,060
but it's the first thing here so

2245
01:28:34,060 --> 01:28:36,060
I'll start with it so the funding is like

2246
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:38,060
a lot of funding happens because

2247
01:28:38,060 --> 01:28:40,060
governments are fund a lot of research

2248
01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:42,060
so like um the national science

2249
01:28:42,060 --> 01:28:44,060
foundation or the national institute of health

2250
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:46,060
and the problem with that is like

2251
01:28:46,060 --> 01:28:48,060
they just fund very specific things

2252
01:28:48,060 --> 01:28:50,060
and they don't go broad and they only

2253
01:28:50,060 --> 01:28:52,060
fund things that they know they don't fund moon shot ideas

2254
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:54,060
but in d-side

2255
01:28:54,060 --> 01:28:56,060
um you have access to a lot more

2256
01:28:56,060 --> 01:28:58,060
people so you can crowd fund ideas

2257
01:28:58,060 --> 01:29:00,060
and you can do a lot more crazy stuff

2258
01:29:00,060 --> 01:29:02,060
publications

2259
01:29:02,060 --> 01:29:04,060
are very broken in traditional science

2260
01:29:04,060 --> 01:29:06,060
so

2261
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:08,060
publications in traditional science

2262
01:29:08,060 --> 01:29:10,060
go through a peer review but the peer reviewers

2263
01:29:10,060 --> 01:29:12,060
don't actually read the papers they just sort of

2264
01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:14,060
look at it and move on

2265
01:29:14,060 --> 01:29:16,060
um in d-side

2266
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:18,060
anyone can be a peer reviewer and you can like bet

2267
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:20,060
on individual contributions

2268
01:29:20,060 --> 01:29:22,060
um then uh

2269
01:29:22,060 --> 01:29:24,060
data sharing so in traditional science

2270
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:26,060
data is very locked and in d-side

2271
01:29:26,060 --> 01:29:28,060
the data sets are like open

2272
01:29:28,060 --> 01:29:30,060
and you can pay and reproduce experiments very easily

2273
01:29:30,060 --> 01:29:32,060
um community

2274
01:29:32,060 --> 01:29:34,060
uh like

2275
01:29:34,060 --> 01:29:36,060
in a traditional science setting like

2276
01:29:36,060 --> 01:29:38,060
you only have you only sort of do research

2277
01:29:38,060 --> 01:29:40,060
within the lab setting but in d-side

2278
01:29:40,060 --> 01:29:42,060
um you have a global

2279
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:44,060
access you can access a lot more people

2280
01:29:44,060 --> 01:29:46,060
which is cool um IP

2281
01:29:46,060 --> 01:29:48,060
can be shared governance

2282
01:29:48,060 --> 01:29:50,060
is instead of just like a

2283
01:29:50,060 --> 01:29:52,060
the lab manager doing all the research

2284
01:29:52,060 --> 01:29:54,060
and directing things

2285
01:29:54,060 --> 01:29:56,060
uh everything can go up to a token vote

2286
01:29:56,060 --> 01:29:58,060
so if there's a question around

2287
01:29:58,060 --> 01:30:00,060
do experiment A or experiment B

2288
01:30:00,060 --> 01:30:02,060
um instead of just relying on one person

2289
01:30:02,060 --> 01:30:04,060
to do it you can you can issue

2290
01:30:04,060 --> 01:30:06,060
you can have like a vote on

2291
01:30:06,060 --> 01:30:08,060
uh snapshot and decide on what

2292
01:30:08,060 --> 01:30:10,060
does then use the collective intelligence to figure out

2293
01:30:10,060 --> 01:30:12,060
what the next step should be and then

2294
01:30:12,060 --> 01:30:14,060
the reproducible I think is one of the most important ones

2295
01:30:14,060 --> 01:30:16,060
like I think in a lot of research

2296
01:30:16,060 --> 01:30:18,060
today um

2297
01:30:18,060 --> 01:30:20,060
like most of the papers are not

2298
01:30:20,060 --> 01:30:22,060
reproducible because they're either too complex

2299
01:30:22,060 --> 01:30:24,060
they don't reveal enough about how their methodology

2300
01:30:24,060 --> 01:30:26,060
or uh it's

2301
01:30:26,060 --> 01:30:28,060
uh they p-value hack

2302
01:30:28,060 --> 01:30:30,060
and there's all sorts of issues but in d-side

2303
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:32,060
all the because everything is

2304
01:30:32,060 --> 01:30:34,060
disintermediated between

2305
01:30:34,060 --> 01:30:36,060
physical entities everything is sort of logged

2306
01:30:36,060 --> 01:30:38,060
on chain so you can easily just like

2307
01:30:38,060 --> 01:30:40,060
replay back everything

2308
01:30:40,060 --> 01:30:42,060
and see which sort of science which

2309
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:44,060
science is valid and which science is invalid

2310
01:30:44,060 --> 01:30:46,060
okay

2311
01:30:46,060 --> 01:30:48,060
um

2312
01:30:48,060 --> 01:30:50,060
so the way it works is like

2313
01:30:50,060 --> 01:30:52,060
if you want to create a d-side project

2314
01:30:52,060 --> 01:30:54,060
you first create you have an idea

2315
01:30:54,060 --> 01:30:56,060
and you say I want to create an idea around

2316
01:30:56,060 --> 01:30:58,060
sleep

2317
01:30:58,060 --> 01:31:00,060
and um everyone who contributes to that project

2318
01:31:00,060 --> 01:31:02,060
is issued a token

2319
01:31:02,060 --> 01:31:04,060
so maybe you contribute through

2320
01:31:04,060 --> 01:31:06,060
um giving sleep data

2321
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:08,060
maybe you contribute through

2322
01:31:08,060 --> 01:31:10,060
uh doing an algorithm

2323
01:31:10,060 --> 01:31:12,060
uh developing some sort of algorithm

2324
01:31:12,060 --> 01:31:14,060
maybe you contribute through um recruiting

2325
01:31:14,060 --> 01:31:16,060
people and for each of these different

2326
01:31:16,060 --> 01:31:18,060
things you get tokens

2327
01:31:20,060 --> 01:31:22,060
um and these we have the

2328
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:24,060
like data pools so people can sort of contribute

2329
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:26,060
to a data pool

2330
01:31:26,060 --> 01:31:28,060
so if for example for sleep you can use

2331
01:31:28,060 --> 01:31:30,060
like the o-ring and contribute

2332
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:32,060
to a data pool and that data pool

2333
01:31:32,060 --> 01:31:34,060
will then be accessible to anyone

2334
01:31:34,060 --> 01:31:36,060
who's interested in uh sleep

2335
01:31:38,060 --> 01:31:40,060
other types of data

2336
01:31:40,060 --> 01:31:42,060
pools that I think are really interesting are like

2337
01:31:42,060 --> 01:31:44,060
blueprint is very popular these days

2338
01:31:44,060 --> 01:31:46,060
so like longevity like how do

2339
01:31:46,060 --> 01:31:48,060
you determine if these types of things

2340
01:31:48,060 --> 01:31:50,060
these interventions work is you're going to need

2341
01:31:50,060 --> 01:31:52,060
like very very um like

2342
01:31:52,060 --> 01:31:54,060
broad data sets so

2343
01:31:54,060 --> 01:31:56,060
things around like spoo

2344
01:31:56,060 --> 01:31:58,060
um things around o-ring and things around

2345
01:31:58,060 --> 01:32:00,060
like genomic data are all

2346
01:32:00,060 --> 01:32:02,060
going to be really really interesting to determine

2347
01:32:02,060 --> 01:32:04,060
like uh these these are

2348
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:06,060
these are prime data sets to figure out

2349
01:32:06,060 --> 01:32:08,060
like what's working and what's not working

2350
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:14,060
um you can you can do a lot more with like

2351
01:32:14,060 --> 01:32:16,060
data quality so right now in a

2352
01:32:16,060 --> 01:32:18,060
research project um

2353
01:32:18,060 --> 01:32:20,060
people just sort of like put in things

2354
01:32:20,060 --> 01:32:22,060
like maybe the phd scene will like

2355
01:32:22,060 --> 01:32:24,060
look for outliers and remove those

2356
01:32:24,060 --> 01:32:26,060
and then sort of move on

2357
01:32:26,060 --> 01:32:28,060
but when you have like a decentralized

2358
01:32:28,060 --> 01:32:30,060
science system

2359
01:32:30,060 --> 01:32:32,060
people can like um stake

2360
01:32:32,060 --> 01:32:34,060
on data so when you submit

2361
01:32:34,060 --> 01:32:36,060
data to a research project

2362
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:38,060
you can submit like uh

2363
01:32:38,060 --> 01:32:40,060
five dollars along with it

2364
01:32:40,060 --> 01:32:42,060
and why that's important is because if you then

2365
01:32:42,060 --> 01:32:44,060
if you contributed bad data

2366
01:32:44,060 --> 01:32:46,060
like you can get slashed so you'll

2367
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:48,060
get your five dollars back so you sort of like

2368
01:32:48,060 --> 01:32:50,060
spam the system and then you

2369
01:32:50,060 --> 01:32:52,060
your data will be removed and so it's

2370
01:32:52,060 --> 01:32:54,060
incentivizing you to produce like

2371
01:32:54,060 --> 01:32:56,060
high quality data that can be verified

2372
01:32:56,060 --> 01:32:58,060
um and that's like these these are

2373
01:32:58,060 --> 01:33:00,060
the types of things that you can do

2374
01:33:00,060 --> 01:33:02,060
um with with like d-side but not with

2375
01:33:02,060 --> 01:33:04,060
like traditional science

2376
01:33:04,060 --> 01:33:06,060
um people can just like you could have

2377
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:08,060
like a uh an exchange

2378
01:33:08,060 --> 01:33:10,060
sort of like coinbase you can

2379
01:33:10,060 --> 01:33:12,060
you can have like oh i want

2380
01:33:12,060 --> 01:33:14,060
to invest in or i want to invest but i want

2381
01:33:14,060 --> 01:33:16,060
to participate in um

2382
01:33:16,060 --> 01:33:18,060
like bitcoin or crypto

2383
01:33:18,060 --> 01:33:20,060
or like ethereum and similarly

2384
01:33:20,060 --> 01:33:22,060
it could be like oh i want to

2385
01:33:22,060 --> 01:33:24,060
participate in an hrv study

2386
01:33:24,060 --> 01:33:26,060
or a sleeve study or uh

2387
01:33:26,060 --> 01:33:28,060
a co2 study

2388
01:33:28,060 --> 01:33:30,060
so it sort of opens it up to

2389
01:33:30,060 --> 01:33:32,060
a lot more people um and then

2390
01:33:32,060 --> 01:33:34,060
this is one of the more interesting things you can

2391
01:33:34,060 --> 01:33:36,060
like instead of like how many

2392
01:33:36,060 --> 01:33:38,060
like how many people know what a prediction market is

2393
01:33:38,060 --> 01:33:40,060
okay so imagine

2394
01:33:40,060 --> 01:33:42,060
a prediction market it's just

2395
01:33:42,060 --> 01:33:44,060
like a it's like a betting market or

2396
01:33:44,060 --> 01:33:46,060
like you predict what's going to happen in the future

2397
01:33:46,060 --> 01:33:48,060
and if you're right you win tokens

2398
01:33:48,060 --> 01:33:50,060
and if you're wrong you lose tokens

2399
01:33:50,060 --> 01:33:52,060
and imagine like a prediction market

2400
01:33:52,060 --> 01:33:54,060
or like scientific experiments

2401
01:33:54,060 --> 01:33:56,060
so you're incentivized to um

2402
01:33:56,060 --> 01:33:58,060
think about like what types of experiments

2403
01:33:58,060 --> 01:34:00,060
are going to work and what type of experiments are not

2404
01:34:00,060 --> 01:34:02,060
going to work and this in this

2405
01:34:02,060 --> 01:34:04,060
like this is like this is very

2406
01:34:04,060 --> 01:34:06,060
different from peer review so peer review is like

2407
01:34:06,060 --> 01:34:08,060
i have no skin in the game i don't care if this paper's

2408
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:10,060
been accepted or rejected now let's like flip that around

2409
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:12,060
if i'm correct this paper is

2410
01:34:12,060 --> 01:34:14,060
correct i'm going to like earn tokens

2411
01:34:14,060 --> 01:34:16,060
now i'm like going to spend a little

2412
01:34:16,060 --> 01:34:18,060
more time reviewing it because it's like

2413
01:34:18,060 --> 01:34:20,060
you want to you want to do really good diligence on it

2414
01:34:20,060 --> 01:34:22,060
so

2415
01:34:22,060 --> 01:34:24,060
the upshot of this is like you're trying

2416
01:34:24,060 --> 01:34:26,060
to align incentives between like high quality

2417
01:34:26,060 --> 01:34:28,060
scientific research and

2418
01:34:28,060 --> 01:34:30,060
um like

2419
01:34:30,060 --> 01:34:32,060
the outcome for the individual

2420
01:34:32,060 --> 01:34:34,060
person

2421
01:34:34,060 --> 01:34:36,060
okay so basically like

2422
01:34:36,060 --> 01:34:38,060
we're trying to build a

2423
01:34:38,060 --> 01:34:40,060
platform that will like enable people

2424
01:34:40,060 --> 01:34:42,060
to participate in decentralized

2425
01:34:42,060 --> 01:34:44,060
project or to spin up one um we've started

2426
01:34:44,060 --> 01:34:46,060
it already it's called um water bear

2427
01:34:46,060 --> 01:34:48,060
got science and we're looking

2428
01:34:48,060 --> 01:34:50,060
where we're hiring so if people here

2429
01:34:50,060 --> 01:34:52,060
are interested in decentralized

2430
01:34:52,060 --> 01:34:54,060
science and um

2431
01:34:54,060 --> 01:34:56,060
um like

2432
01:34:56,060 --> 01:34:58,060
participants specific roles we need

2433
01:34:58,060 --> 01:35:00,060
are like we need like a bd and a community manager

2434
01:35:00,060 --> 01:35:02,060
person since it's a little we're

2435
01:35:02,060 --> 01:35:04,060
we're we're having like like a lot

2436
01:35:04,060 --> 01:35:06,060
of people inbound and uh we can't

2437
01:35:06,060 --> 01:35:08,060
really respond so we're trying to

2438
01:35:08,060 --> 01:35:10,060
grow uh we're

2439
01:35:10,060 --> 01:35:12,060
backed by uh like some

2440
01:35:12,060 --> 01:35:14,060
of the best investors in crypto so

2441
01:35:14,060 --> 01:35:16,060
if you're interested uh we're very

2442
01:35:16,060 --> 01:35:18,060
hiring here's our application

2443
01:35:18,060 --> 01:35:20,060
um it's very short uh we're in

2444
01:35:20,060 --> 01:35:22,060
person um we work

2445
01:35:22,060 --> 01:35:24,060
uh like normal hours

2446
01:35:24,060 --> 01:35:26,060
but it's all in person which i think is good

2447
01:35:26,060 --> 01:35:28,060
and uh i think this is like a great

2448
01:35:28,060 --> 01:35:30,060
community to pull from so if you enjoyed this

2449
01:35:30,060 --> 01:35:32,060
event and you want to participate more uh

2450
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:34,060
definitely apply

2451
01:35:34,060 --> 01:35:36,060
and then

2452
01:35:36,060 --> 01:35:38,060
oh that's it

2453
01:35:38,060 --> 01:35:40,060
do you have any yeah do you have any questions

2454
01:35:40,060 --> 01:35:42,060
yeah

2455
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:44,060
oh

2456
01:35:44,060 --> 01:35:46,060
uh dc.myc

2457
01:35:46,060 --> 01:35:48,060
yeah

2458
01:35:48,060 --> 01:35:50,060
uh so uh i have a question

2459
01:35:50,060 --> 01:35:52,060
so normally uh the government

2460
01:35:52,060 --> 01:35:54,060
uh so

2461
01:35:54,060 --> 01:35:56,060
some of the big resources of funding

2462
01:35:56,060 --> 01:35:58,060
for science and government comes from

2463
01:35:58,060 --> 01:36:00,060
uh dood defense

2464
01:36:00,060 --> 01:36:02,060
energy and medical

2465
01:36:02,060 --> 01:36:04,060
and uh a lot of times

2466
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:06,060
they put the science right into

2467
01:36:06,060 --> 01:36:08,060
applications which generates

2468
01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:10,060
return for them uh what do you

2469
01:36:10,060 --> 01:36:12,060
see as the biggest uh the biggest

2470
01:36:12,060 --> 01:36:14,060
drivers for dc in terms of

2471
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:16,060
funding

2472
01:36:16,060 --> 01:36:18,060
yeah i think there's a lot of people that are

2473
01:36:18,060 --> 01:36:20,060
just passionate about things like i would

2474
01:36:20,060 --> 01:36:22,060
fund uh michael levin research just because

2475
01:36:22,060 --> 01:36:24,060
i think it's cool like i would much rather give him money than

2476
01:36:24,060 --> 01:36:26,060
like some other like random

2477
01:36:26,060 --> 01:36:28,060
like charity

2478
01:36:28,060 --> 01:36:30,060
um so i think that's one i think people

2479
01:36:30,060 --> 01:36:32,060
that have a specific need for it some

2480
01:36:32,060 --> 01:36:34,060
like a rare disease like

2481
01:36:34,060 --> 01:36:36,060
people are much more interested in participating

2482
01:36:36,060 --> 01:36:38,060
in that sort of thing and if you give them

2483
01:36:38,060 --> 01:36:40,060
like a pathway to back

2484
01:36:40,060 --> 01:36:42,060
credible people and participate in that

2485
01:36:42,060 --> 01:36:44,060
type of research i think that's another one

2486
01:36:44,060 --> 01:36:46,060
um and and then people who are

2487
01:36:46,060 --> 01:36:48,060
just interested in science as well like

2488
01:36:48,060 --> 01:36:50,060
i think there's a lot of people that want to continue

2489
01:36:50,060 --> 01:36:52,060
education maybe have uh

2490
01:36:52,060 --> 01:36:54,060
knowledge and they enjoy doing it in that free time

2491
01:36:54,060 --> 01:36:56,060
that also i think the cost are decreasing so like

2492
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:58,060
previously it used to be a lot harder

2493
01:36:58,060 --> 01:37:00,060
to do a science project but there's a lot

2494
01:37:00,060 --> 01:37:02,060
of like clinical research organizations

2495
01:37:02,060 --> 01:37:04,060
and a lot of automation and a lot of ai

2496
01:37:04,060 --> 01:37:06,060
that's happening that's i think bringing down some of the

2497
01:37:06,060 --> 01:37:08,060
costs associated with like traditional research

2498
01:37:10,060 --> 01:37:12,060
i mean i guess we'll make up a lot of

2499
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:14,060
uh

2500
01:37:14,060 --> 01:37:16,060
uh yeah good um i guess

2501
01:37:16,060 --> 01:37:18,060
kind of like a follow-up but there's

2502
01:37:18,060 --> 01:37:20,060
usually a lot of ip coming out of research

2503
01:37:20,060 --> 01:37:22,060
to spin-offs and stuff

2504
01:37:22,060 --> 01:37:24,060
and so on um i

2505
01:37:24,060 --> 01:37:26,060
assume that that could be also framework where

2506
01:37:26,060 --> 01:37:28,060
incentives could be aligned

2507
01:37:28,060 --> 01:37:30,060
if you get part of that is that part of

2508
01:37:30,060 --> 01:37:32,060
the entire equation or yeah

2509
01:37:32,060 --> 01:37:34,060
so that's like

2510
01:37:34,060 --> 01:37:36,060
what's like how it works is you have an idea

2511
01:37:36,060 --> 01:37:38,060
around like let's just take an example

2512
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:40,060
of

2513
01:37:40,060 --> 01:37:42,060
like mental health like so you create a mental

2514
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:44,060
health now around a specific topic

2515
01:37:44,060 --> 01:37:46,060
and then everyone who participates it like that

2516
01:37:46,060 --> 01:37:48,060
sort of wraps that's the ip any ip

2517
01:37:48,060 --> 01:37:50,060
that's created as part of that group is tokenized

2518
01:37:50,060 --> 01:37:52,060
sort of and everyone who participates

2519
01:37:52,060 --> 01:37:54,060
and does work earns tokens

2520
01:37:54,060 --> 01:37:56,060
based on their participation so if you contribute data

2521
01:37:56,060 --> 01:37:58,060
if you contribute analysis

2522
01:37:58,060 --> 01:38:00,060
if you recruit patients if you publish it

2523
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:02,060
you become you or you get these

2524
01:38:02,060 --> 01:38:04,060
tokens commiserate with your

2525
01:38:04,060 --> 01:38:06,060
how much you contributed

2526
01:38:06,060 --> 01:38:08,060
yeah and so that's

2527
01:38:08,060 --> 01:38:10,060
that's one of the things that's nice about d-size

2528
01:38:10,060 --> 01:38:12,060
like it solves the ip issue

2529
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:14,060
so in like a in like a traditional

2530
01:38:14,060 --> 01:38:16,060
setting you'd work with the university's

2531
01:38:16,060 --> 01:38:18,060
tech transfer office and they take a third

2532
01:38:18,060 --> 01:38:20,060
and a third and a third and it becomes impossible

2533
01:38:20,060 --> 01:38:22,060
and a lot of people a lot of research dies there

2534
01:38:22,060 --> 01:38:24,060
for partially that reason but here it's much easier

2535
01:38:24,060 --> 01:38:26,060
like all the data is tokenized

2536
01:38:26,060 --> 01:38:28,060
and there's a lot of liquidity around it

2537
01:38:28,060 --> 01:38:30,060
so you can exit or

2538
01:38:30,060 --> 01:38:32,060
enter back in if you choose

2539
01:38:32,060 --> 01:38:34,060
you can also like

2540
01:38:34,060 --> 01:38:36,060
uh

2541
01:38:36,060 --> 01:38:38,060
invest some of the ip

2542
01:38:38,060 --> 01:38:40,060
so it keeps people invested in the project

2543
01:38:40,060 --> 01:38:42,060
like one of the projects one of the problems

2544
01:38:42,060 --> 01:38:44,060
now with like university

2545
01:38:44,060 --> 01:38:46,060
researchers people graduate and then they leave

2546
01:38:46,060 --> 01:38:48,060
but if they invest it over

2547
01:38:48,060 --> 01:38:50,060
maybe a longer investing period they might

2548
01:38:50,060 --> 01:38:52,060
want some advice to stick around

2549
01:38:52,060 --> 01:38:54,060
thanks Michael

2550
01:38:54,060 --> 01:38:56,060
you mentioned that if someone spams

2551
01:38:56,060 --> 01:38:58,060
the system with incorrect data that that could

2552
01:38:58,060 --> 01:39:00,060
be removed how would that happen

2553
01:39:00,060 --> 01:39:02,060
if it's on the blockchain

2554
01:39:02,060 --> 01:39:04,060
uh yeah it would just be marked

2555
01:39:04,060 --> 01:39:06,060
each um there's a couple different ways

2556
01:39:06,060 --> 01:39:08,060
of doing it one is to

2557
01:39:08,060 --> 01:39:10,060
allow any data and allow like some

2558
01:39:10,060 --> 01:39:12,060
agent to just

2559
01:39:12,060 --> 01:39:14,060
it finds on the research project the simplest thing is allow

2560
01:39:14,060 --> 01:39:16,060
all data and then use some sort of

2561
01:39:16,060 --> 01:39:18,060
ai or human to judge which is good

2562
01:39:18,060 --> 01:39:20,060
bad quality data um the second one

2563
01:39:20,060 --> 01:39:22,060
is to do like a community

2564
01:39:22,060 --> 01:39:24,060
voting so you have like a jury

2565
01:39:24,060 --> 01:39:26,060
and they vote on each piece of

2566
01:39:26,060 --> 01:39:28,060
data to see if it should be accepted or rejected

2567
01:39:28,060 --> 01:39:30,060
or maybe you could use something like a liquid

2568
01:39:30,060 --> 01:39:32,060
democracy approach where you can assign

2569
01:39:32,060 --> 01:39:34,060
your voting power to another

2570
01:39:34,060 --> 01:39:36,060
person and Dave can vote on your behalf

2571
01:39:36,060 --> 01:39:38,060
of if this data is good or not and you just

2572
01:39:38,060 --> 01:39:40,060
trust this person and then the

2573
01:39:40,060 --> 01:39:42,060
crypto economic way of doing it is to

2574
01:39:42,060 --> 01:39:44,060
um have people stake

2575
01:39:44,060 --> 01:39:46,060
money on their data so

2576
01:39:46,060 --> 01:39:48,060
when before you can contribute the data

2577
01:39:48,060 --> 01:39:50,060
to the data set you have to you contribute

2578
01:39:50,060 --> 01:39:52,060
it along with the five dollar bill

2579
01:39:52,060 --> 01:39:54,060
if your data is accepted by the community

2580
01:39:54,060 --> 01:39:56,060
you get your five dollars back you get

2581
01:39:56,060 --> 01:39:58,060
your data accepted into the community and your tokens

2582
01:39:58,060 --> 01:40:00,060
in return and whatever

2583
01:40:00,060 --> 01:40:02,060
benefits are associated with those tokens

2584
01:40:02,060 --> 01:40:04,060
but if your data is considered bad

2585
01:40:04,060 --> 01:40:06,060
by some standard then

2586
01:40:06,060 --> 01:40:08,060
the five dollars is removed

2587
01:40:08,060 --> 01:40:10,060
it's kept by the community

2588
01:40:10,060 --> 01:40:12,060
and um

2589
01:40:12,060 --> 01:40:14,060
the data is thrown away and

2590
01:40:14,060 --> 01:40:16,060
you might the next question you'd ask is like

2591
01:40:16,060 --> 01:40:18,060
um what prevents like

2592
01:40:18,060 --> 01:40:20,060
why would you contribute to what if there's a bad

2593
01:40:20,060 --> 01:40:22,060
community and uh

2594
01:40:22,060 --> 01:40:24,060
they just kept all the money associated with the data

2595
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:26,060
that's come in and the answer to that is

2596
01:40:26,060 --> 01:40:28,060
like um all

2597
01:40:28,060 --> 01:40:30,060
transactions that have been submitted to the

2598
01:40:30,060 --> 01:40:32,060
DAO for to

2599
01:40:32,060 --> 01:40:34,060
accept the data are on chain so you could

2600
01:40:34,060 --> 01:40:36,060
review the previous connected to the previous

2601
01:40:36,060 --> 01:40:38,060
submissions and say like

2602
01:40:38,060 --> 01:40:40,060
they've submitted a hundred people

2603
01:40:40,060 --> 01:40:42,060
have submitted great quality data and it's all been

2604
01:40:42,060 --> 01:40:44,060
rejected this DAO is

2605
01:40:44,060 --> 01:40:46,060
um is

2606
01:40:46,060 --> 01:40:48,060
terrible I'm not going to participate in it

2607
01:40:52,060 --> 01:40:54,060
anybody else

2608
01:40:54,060 --> 01:40:56,060
cool

2609
01:40:56,060 --> 01:40:58,060
well um

2610
01:40:58,060 --> 01:41:00,060
thank you all for coming it's amazing

2611
01:41:00,060 --> 01:41:02,060
to see all you here

2612

we might do one in between and we haven't scheduled it yet

2615
01:41:08,060 --> 01:41:10,060
but the August 1st one is the next one

2616
01:41:10,060 --> 01:41:12,060
and if you're interested in decentralized science

2617
01:41:12,060 --> 01:41:14,060
or you know someone that is share with a friend

2618
01:41:14,060 --> 01:41:16,060
and uh recommend them
