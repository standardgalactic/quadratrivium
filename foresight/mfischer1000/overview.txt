 In this conversation, Michael Strobel discusses the Decentralized Science (DeSci) platform and its potential to address intellectual property (IP) challenges in research. He explains that DeSci allows for the tokenization of IP created by researchers, ensuring that contributors are fairly compensated for their work. This is particularly beneficial as it avoids the common issue where a significant portion of IP rights can be taken by universities or tech transfer offices.

Michael also touches upon the mechanisms for handling incorrect data on the blockchain. He outlines three approaches:

1. **Open Submission with AI/Human Moderation**: All data is submitted and then moderated or judged by AI algorithms or human experts to determine its quality.
2. **Community Voting**: A jury of individuals within the community votes on the validity of each piece of data, similar to a peer-review process.
3. **Liquid Democracy**: Voting power is assignable, allowing individuals to delegate their voting rights to others who can decide on the quality of submitted data.

Another mechanism discussed is staking, where researchers contribute a financial stake along with their data. If the community accepts the data, the stake is returned; if not, it's forfeited. This incentivizes participants to submit accurate and valuable data.

To prevent malicious behavior such as submitting large amounts of bad data, all transactions are recorded on the blockchain, allowing the community to review past decisions and ensure the integrity of the platform.

Finally, Michael invites everyone to join future discussions on DeSci, emphasizing an upcoming event on August 1st and encouraging participants to spread the word to those interested in the field.
