30000	32000	We're going to start.
32000	33000	Do we sit on the monitor?
33000	34000	Yeah.
34000	35000	Welcome.
35000	36000	Oh.
36000	37000	Hello.
37000	38000	Hello.
38000	39000	Hello.
39000	40000	Hello.
40000	41000	Hello.
41000	42000	Hello.
42000	43000	Hello.
43000	44000	Oh, there it is working.
44000	45000	Someone's joining.
45000	46000	Test one, two, admit.
46000	47000	Okay.
47000	48000	There we go.
48000	49000	Okay.
49000	50000	So just leave room over here.
50000	51000	So squeeze in that way to the right.
51000	52000	To your left.
52000	53000	To your right.
53000	54000	Sorry.
54000	59000	This is the order here.
59000	60000	Good.
60000	63000	You guys, come on this place for it.
63000	64000	This is our room here.
64000	65000	Please.
65000	66000	Please space, space.
66000	68000	Don't be shy.
68000	78000	Say hello to your neighbor.
78000	79000	Do you guys want to?
79000	80000	Anyone else?
80000	82000	It's okay.
82000	87000	First off, thank you guys all for coming.
87720	89320	How many of you know why you're here?
91320	95320	How many of you know what decentralized science is at all?
95320	96920	Yes, some people?
96920	97760	There's some people?
97760	100800	Okay, yeah, this is decentralized science
100800	102760	in this vicinity here.
103800	108280	How many of you have been to a Deci NYC event before?
108280	110440	Oh wow, so many people.
110440	112880	We have a lot of return desires.
112880	115200	We're gonna issue a token at some point, which will be cool.
115200	116720	Like a Deci NYC token,
116720	120480	so you can memorialize your being on the blockchain.
122160	124600	Cool, well without further,
124600	126600	let's just do a quick picture.
128600	130520	We'll do a panoramic one.
132560	136120	Oh, someone's, okay, smile, smile, smile.
136120	138320	Smile, smile, smile.
138320	141320	This one's on the Twitter and such.
141320	142160	Okay.
143960	147400	Oh my gosh, I think this might be one of our largest ones.
147400	149720	And let me just do one more.
149720	151920	Okay, so we're gonna do it slightly differently this time.
151920	155600	So Michael Levin is going to speak first.
155600	157400	How many of you have seen Michael Levin
157400	160080	on one of his talks already?
160080	163080	Like when we were, wow, that's a lot of people.
163080	164480	Okay, one more.
164480	167280	When I was promoting this event,
167400	170200	we got a lot of DMs who said he's my favorite speaker.
170200	171640	Can you hear us, Michael?
171640	172480	Yeah, I can.
172480	173320	Okay, good.
173320	176560	He said, this is one of his favorite,
176560	178040	a couple of people messaged me saying
178040	180280	Michael Levin is one of our favorite
182280	183720	tech speakers that they've ever seen.
183720	187440	So that was just totally cool.
188360	190120	Can you see the audience here, Michael?
190120	190960	Yeah, yeah, I can.
190960	191800	80 people, right?
191800	193120	Yeah.
193120	195460	And then, what else did I want to say?
196460	197660	There was one thing, oh yeah.
197660	202020	If you guys post us on Twitter or on Instagram,
202020	203740	we'd be forever grateful.
203740	204820	It helps us read the word.
204820	207220	It helps to decentralize science.
207220	209060	It helps to get the word out.
209060	211340	So, I'm gonna let Michael speak.
211340	212540	But I'm just gonna say one thing.
212540	214440	If you like decentralized science,
215580	217500	we started a decentralized science company.
217500	218940	I'll talk more about it in a second,
218940	220460	but I know some people are gonna go.
220460	223660	But I just wanna say, if you're looking for a job,
223660	226980	we're hiring to do a decentralized science platform.
226980	229060	So, if this is interesting to you,
229060	231340	we have an in-person office in New York City.
231340	232940	We're looking to hire community managers,
232940	235420	developers, business people.
235420	237100	We pay really, really well.
237100	240140	And we have a great office and a great team.
240140	241260	And we're looking to grow.
241260	243620	So, if you're interested in this
243620	245540	and you're interested in decentralized science,
245540	247500	maybe you're an angry academic.
247500	249940	Maybe you're looking to change the world.
249940	251500	Maybe you're looking to see something better.
251500	252340	We'll do this.
252340	253740	I just wanted to get that before.
253740	256740	I'll do a little talk on what is decentralized science
256740	259220	after Professor Levin speaks.
259220	261660	So, without further ado,
261660	265300	Professor Levin is a professor at Tufts University,
265300	269220	super renowned in his field for his work on bioelectricity,
269220	270500	which was when I first heard about it.
270500	271540	I was amazed.
271540	273340	And I'll let you take it from here.
274260	275100	Yeah, thanks so much.
275100	276580	Let's give him a round of applause.
276580	281580	Thank you so much for the invitation.
282340	283860	And that's a very kind introduction.
283860	286580	And thanks for letting me share some ideas with you.
286580	288420	So, let me, let's see,
288420	293020	I'm going to figure out how to share a screen here.
293020	293980	All right.
293980	296180	So, I'm going to turn on my slides.
296180	297780	And when I do, I will not be able to see you.
297780	298860	So, if anything goes wrong,
298860	302540	just please somebody speak up, realize.
302540	304180	All right, here we go.
304180	306620	Okay, so what I'd like to talk about today
306620	309260	is the field of diverse intelligence.
309260	312980	And specifically the kind of cognitive processes
312980	314220	that go on in your body
314220	317020	and what this means for various other issues.
317020	318460	You can find all the primary work,
318460	320460	like the primary papers, data sets, software,
320460	322020	everything at this site.
322020	325020	And you can sign up for announcements
325020	329580	and get some thoughts beyond what I can say
329580	330940	in peer reviewed publications.
330940	332660	You can get that in my blog here.
333620	336540	So, there's four things I'd like to talk about today.
336540	338900	First of all, I'm going to talk a little bit about
338900	342460	what I mean by diverse or unconventional intelligence.
342460	344820	I will give you some examples of such,
344820	347060	looking at bioelectricity and how it functions
347060	350340	as a kind of cognitive glue that binds the cells
350340	352700	in your body into a kind of collective intelligence.
352700	354140	And this collective intelligence
354140	356740	solves problems in anatomical space,
356740	358620	also known as morpheus space.
358620	361140	I will talk about some biomedical applications
361140	364940	that result from thinking in these kinds of ways.
364940	365780	And towards the end,
365780	367980	we're going to touch on some issues about the future
367980	369940	and what I think it means for all of us.
369940	373420	So, this is a well-known classic painting.
373420	376740	It's called Adam is Naming the Animals in the Garden of Eden.
376740	378620	And I find this very interesting
378620	381940	because I think there's one profoundly wrong aspect
381940	383260	of this old story.
383260	384900	And also there's one very deep aspect
384900	387180	that I think is really right on the money
387180	389580	that we have to absorb.
389580	391100	The part that I think is wrong here
391100	392780	is that this gives you the idea
392780	396060	that these animals are discrete natural kinds, right?
396060	396900	You look at this and you say,
396940	398220	okay, I know what all these animals are.
398220	401380	There's a finite discrete set of individual animals
401380	403700	with specific shapes and specific behaviors.
403700	406780	And Adam is actually different than all of them.
406780	407980	He's special.
407980	410100	And so I think those two things
410100	413340	we're going to have to blow up in the next couple of decades.
413340	416380	That will, I think that's going to disappear.
416380	418820	The part that I think that's really deep here
418820	421220	is that in this old biblical story,
421220	424540	it was actually Adam's job to name the animals.
424540	425460	The angels couldn't do it.
425460	426420	God couldn't do it.
426420	429540	Adam was the one who was supposed to name the animals.
429540	430980	And I think that's for two reasons.
430980	434260	One is that he's the one that's going to have to live with him.
434260	438020	And the other is that in these old kind of mystical traditions,
438020	440500	naming something or knowing the name
440500	442420	of the real name of something
442420	444620	means that you've understood its true nature.
444620	447020	And that understanding is supposed to give you power
447020	447860	over that thing, right?
447860	449980	So knowing the name of something is really deep.
449980	451580	And I think this is important
451580	453300	because we are all going to have to name
453300	455820	in this kind of meaning.
455860	460180	We're going to have to name a whole large set of novel beings
460180	461260	that have never been here before
461260	463100	with whom we are going to share our world.
463100	465180	And I think that's really important.
465180	470180	So you no doubt have read all kinds of works of philosophy
472420	475340	and other more modern, maybe stories
475340	477380	about the difference between humans
477380	479300	and maybe machines and other things.
479300	481180	And what people typically have in mind
481180	483060	when they say those things is this,
483060	486100	kind of this typical adult modern human
486100	489340	that has this like a gentle special glow about them.
489340	491540	But we've known now for a really long time
491540	494340	that both on an evolutionary time scale
494340	497300	and also a developmental time scale,
497300	499580	there is actually a continuum of bodies
499580	501580	and we'll get back to this towards the end of the talk.
501580	504660	But actually if this form has very slowly
504660	507820	and gradually evolved from all these other forms
507820	511180	and originally a unicellular microbial ancestor,
511180	513460	then the same thing is true during your lifetime.
513460	516820	So whatever properties this kind of being has,
516820	520300	and so memory, true goals, preferences,
520300	525300	understanding, moral worth, responsibility, and so on,
525460	527620	we really, as scientists and philosophers,
527620	530860	we really owe some a story about how that arises.
530860	533860	Where in this continuum does that actually show up?
533860	535220	And is it better to think about that
535220	536580	as a kind of discrete thing,
536580	537900	you have it or you don't have it?
537900	541140	Or what I think is that it's actually a continuum,
541140	544220	the right question is what kind and how much?
544220	546860	And so I've been working on a framework
546860	550260	to enable us to recognize, create,
550260	554500	and ethically relate to a really diverse set of intelligences
554500	556620	that are very different from the kinds of things
556620	559460	that we usually recognize as intelligences.
559460	562540	So apes, birds, maybe an octopus or a whale or something.
562540	564100	But all kinds of other creatures,
564100	566580	colonial organisms and swarms like beehives
566580	569700	and ant colonies, synthetic biology,
569740	572180	engineered new life forms, AIs,
572180	574380	whether robotic or purely software,
574380	576340	and maybe at some point, aliens,
576340	579580	at some point maybe we find some exobiological life.
579580	581180	So we need to be able to talk
581180	582860	about all of these things simultaneously.
582860	585140	What do they all have in common?
585140	587020	And I'm not the first person to try
587020	588020	for a framework like this.
588020	592620	This is 1943, Wiener, Rosenbluth, and Bigelow
592620	595940	tried for a scale that goes all the way from passive matter,
595940	598020	so basically simple passive materials,
598020	602020	all the way up through these kinds of different stages
602020	605420	to the kind of complex second order metacognition
605420	608500	that humans have where they can think about themselves
608500	610860	and they know that they know things and so on.
610860	613860	So what we need is a story of scaling.
613860	617820	How do very simple information processing kinds
617820	620220	of acts become minds?
620220	622180	And whatever framework that we come up with,
622180	623980	it has to move experimental work forward.
623980	625140	It can't just be philosophy.
625140	626980	It's actually give us new capabilities,
626980	628900	for example, new biomedicine.
628900	631180	And it also has to enhance ethics.
631180	635060	It has to enhance our ability to understand our world
635060	638580	and relate to it with the appropriate kind of compassion.
638580	643580	So the fundamental fact is that all of us take this journey.
643740	644980	We've all made this journey
644980	646780	from what people call just physics.
646780	649340	And I really hate that term, but people use it.
649340	652820	As an unfertilized oocyte, you were once,
652820	655820	all of us were once a little blob of chemicals.
655860	657380	And when people look at that blob,
657380	661140	they say, okay, well, this is just a physical chemical system.
661140	662380	It obeys the laws of chemistry.
662380	664940	There is no mind here, just a bunch of chemicals.
664940	667860	But at some point, slowly and gradually,
667860	671500	it turns into one of these amazing kinds of creatures
671500	672580	or even something like this.
672580	674660	Here's Rene Descartes, who was fond of saying
674660	679660	that he was not a machine and had special properties.
680820	683780	And so that's fine, but we need to really then tell a story
683780	685180	of where does that happen?
685220	688220	And developmental biology offers absolutely no place
688220	690420	where you can draw a bright line and say, okay,
690420	691940	before that it was just a bunch of chemicals
691940	693260	doing the things that chemicals do,
693260	696180	but now bang, now it's a real being with a real mind
696180	698660	and preferences and goals and so on.
698660	700780	There is no spot like that in developmental biology.
700780	703300	So we really need to understand the scaling this.
703300	706140	Well, at least, okay, so that's a little,
706140	710300	that should be, if you take that on to really understand that,
710300	712140	it should be a little disturbing,
712140	714580	but at least we're a true unified intelligence, right?
714580	716340	We're not like an ant colony,
716340	718540	which people do describe ants and termites
718540	721420	as a kind of collective intelligence,
721420	722660	but we're not like that, right?
722660	725060	Like we are a centralized unified mind,
725060	726900	you know, we have a brain and everything.
726900	729660	Well, Rene Descartes thought so,
729660	732180	and in particular, he was fond of the pineal gland
732180	733860	because there's only one of them in the brain
733860	736700	and he felt that our unified human intelligence
736700	738180	should have one spot in the brain
738180	740740	that isn't duplicated the way that other structures are.
740740	743840	But if he had access to microscopes,
743840	745360	he would have discovered that actually,
745360	746760	there isn't one of anything
746760	749280	because in the pineal gland, this is what it looks like.
749280	751880	There are huge numbers of individual cells.
751880	753440	And if he had really good microscopy
753440	755920	inside each one of those cells, he would see this.
755920	757200	This is what's actually inside.
757200	760120	All of this stuff is inside every cell.
760120	763520	So actually all of us are collective intelligences.
763520	766920	Even we know no less than ant colonies
766920	769600	and beehives and flocks of birds,
769600	771680	we are all made of parts.
771680	773720	And in fact, I think all intelligence
773720	775360	is collective intelligence.
775360	778200	In fact, for us, this is the sort of thing we're made of.
778200	780320	Now, this happens to be a free living organism
780320	783160	known as alachromaria, but it's a single cell.
783160	785360	And you can see the amazing competency
785360	787680	it has at its local scale.
787680	789660	So with respect to single cell events,
789660	792000	it handles all of its anatomical needs,
792000	795040	its metabolic needs, its physiological needs,
795040	798320	no brain, no nervous system, no stem cells,
798320	801520	everything is handled by this amazing little organism.
801520	804800	And we are a large collective of cells
804800	808040	that have enormous competencies in different spaces.
808040	810960	And so if you look at our structure,
810960	814280	not only are we a set of nested dolls
814280	818280	consisting of various chemicals and subcellular components
818280	820840	and then tissues and organs and organisms
820840	822800	and then of course, societies and swarms,
822800	825720	not only structurally are we a collection
825720	828120	of these hierarchical levels,
828120	831800	but actually each of these has its own competency,
831800	835000	its own intelligence, its own problem-solving capacity.
835000	836640	So in other kinds of spaces,
836640	838820	not just in three-dimensional space that we're used to,
838820	841360	such as, for example, when mice run mazes and so on,
841360	844180	but in other spaces, the space of physiological states,
844180	846880	the space of all possible types of gene expression,
846880	850080	the space of all possible anatomical configurations.
850080	852640	In all of these spaces, the different levels
852640	855720	of your body structure are solving problems,
855760	860760	pursuing goals, storing and utilizing memories
860760	864200	and navigating those spaces with great ingenuity.
864200	866480	That amazing architecture,
866480	869420	this multi-scale competency architecture,
869420	872520	which currently our technology and robotics
872520	876440	and our typical AIs don't use anything like that.
876440	878720	No reason why we couldn't, but no one's done it yet.
878720	882360	But biology uses this amazing multi-scale architecture
882360	885180	and it allows some truly astounding capabilities
885180	886340	for living forms.
886340	888740	I'm gonna show you a couple of interesting examples.
888740	890740	One of the things that biology can do
891660	894580	is have a kind of, you can almost call it
894580	896380	a kind of beginner's mind concept
896380	899580	where it doesn't really make,
899580	902780	evolution doesn't just make organisms
902780	904900	that are solutions to specific problems.
904900	906980	It actually makes problem-solving machines
906980	909980	that come into the world with massive plasticity
909980	912580	ready to take on novel configurations.
912580	914940	So what you're looking at here is a tadpole.
915820	917180	Here's the mouth, here are the nostrils,
917180	918900	here's the brain, here's the tail,
918900	920100	this thing is the gut.
920100	921700	And what you'll notice here is that,
921700	924500	what's happening here is that there are no eyes
924500	926780	in the primary location where the eyes go,
926780	929740	but there is an eye that we induced on the tail.
929740	932180	And what you see is that these animals,
932180	935700	when we built this machine to train these tadpoles
935700	937580	in a visual task, and what you find out
937580	939620	is that they can see perfectly well.
939620	942860	And this eye, which is now located on their tails,
942860	943940	doesn't connect to the brain.
943940	945420	Here's the optic nerve.
945420	947500	Sometimes it connects to the spinal cord like this,
947500	949020	sometimes to nothing at all,
949020	951740	and they do very well in visual assays.
951740	953220	So just think about what this means.
953220	958220	For millions of years, this brain was perfectly adapted
959540	962740	to take visual input right here from the eyes next to it.
962740	965340	And now you've got this weird itchy patch of tissue
965340	967660	on your back that's providing some sort of electrical signal
967660	969340	onto your spinal cord.
969340	972420	Why doesn't it take many rounds
972420	976100	of evolutionary adaptation, mutation, selection
976100	976940	for this to work?
976940	979420	It works right out of the box, first time you do it.
979420	982060	It doesn't require any more evolutionary cycles.
982060	984900	And that's because this kind of creature,
984900	988260	as all of us, has massive plasticity.
989860	992060	There are lots of other interesting features.
992060	995220	For example, these are planaria, these are flatworms.
995220	996620	And what's interesting about these guys
996620	999260	is that they are incredibly regenerative.
999260	1000820	So you can cut them into many pieces.
1000860	1002100	Each piece will regenerate
1002100	1004300	and become a perfect tiny little worm.
1004300	1007060	Now, one thing that James McConnell discovered in the 60s
1007060	1008260	and he got a lot of flak for it,
1008260	1009860	but he was actually right.
1009860	1014860	We repeated his work using modern automated methods in 2013
1014900	1018260	and he was completely right that if you train a planarian,
1018260	1021580	for example, to feed on these little bumpy,
1021580	1023140	at least little bumpy circles,
1023140	1026380	and then you amputate their head, including their brain,
1026380	1028020	and you get this tail left here.
1028020	1028860	The tail sits there,
1028860	1030700	doesn't do much of anything for the next eight days,
1031260	1032580	doesn't have any behavior.
1032580	1035540	But what it does do is it grows back a new brain.
1035540	1036940	And as it grows back a new brain,
1036940	1038460	you then can test these animals
1038460	1039940	and you find out that they've remembered
1039940	1041500	the original information.
1041500	1043500	So not only is the anatomy regenerated,
1043500	1044820	but so are the memories.
1044820	1046980	And actually, whatever, I mean, presumably,
1046980	1050300	they're stored in a tail somewhere we don't know where,
1050300	1052460	and kind of distributed throughout the body.
1052460	1054820	And then they are imprinted onto the new brain
1054820	1058900	as the brain develops so that they can demonstrate behavior.
1058900	1061020	So the movement of information through the body, right?
1061020	1062580	You're seeing here simultaneously
1062580	1064660	the ability to restore anatomical structure,
1064660	1066060	so anatomical memories,
1066060	1068780	but also behavioral memories and these things are linked.
1068780	1072820	And one of the most remarkable examples is this.
1072820	1075180	These are caterpillars and they have a particular brain
1075180	1076860	suitable for crawling around
1076860	1078980	using the soft body architecture
1078980	1081020	in a two-dimensional world.
1081020	1083540	And they need to turn into this.
1083540	1087380	This is a flying, hard-body kind of being
1087380	1089740	that has a completely different life
1089740	1091820	and it has a different brain because of that.
1091820	1092740	In order to do this,
1092740	1095260	it basically destroys most of the brain
1095260	1096300	during metamorphosis,
1096300	1097540	so many of the cells are killed,
1097540	1098700	the connections are broken,
1098700	1101380	and it refactors into a new brain.
1101380	1103260	But what has been found is that
1103260	1106700	if you train these caterpillars on a particular task,
1106700	1110660	the butterflies or moths that results still remember.
1110660	1113620	So there are two fascinating things here.
1113620	1115340	Not only is it amazing to ask,
1115340	1118060	where is the information that it's robust
1118060	1120860	to this incredible refactoring of the memory medium?
1120860	1122500	We don't have any technology like that.
1122500	1124380	If you start shuffling around
1124380	1127780	the pieces of your memory chips inside your computer,
1127780	1129140	nothing's gonna work.
1129140	1131900	But not only is the memory robust,
1131900	1133260	you actually, if you think about it,
1133260	1136580	you realize that you actually can't just store
1136580	1137660	the information,
1137660	1140940	you have to completely reinterpret it for a new context.
1140940	1144060	For example, if you teach these caterpillars to eat leaves
1144100	1146700	when you provide a certain color stimulus,
1146700	1149220	those specific memories are totally useless
1149220	1151300	to the butterfly because butterflies don't eat leaves
1151300	1153340	and they don't move around the way the caterpillars do.
1153340	1155020	They have to reinterpret those memories
1155020	1157300	in a brand new way suitable for this creature
1157300	1159620	in its three-dimensional new life.
1159620	1163240	So during these kind of transformations,
1163240	1164060	you see that memory,
1164060	1166020	biological memory isn't just stored,
1166020	1168900	it's actually actively, creatively reinterpreted.
1168900	1170460	These memory engrams that are made
1170460	1173340	are reinterpreted for their new lifetime.
1173340	1175320	So lots of fascinating things to be said
1175320	1176620	about behavioral memories and so on,
1176620	1178620	but I'm gonna spend a few minutes talking about
1178620	1182180	what we study, which is primarily anatomical memories.
1182180	1184060	So let's think about this.
1184060	1186860	This is a cross-section through the human body.
1186860	1189580	So look at this incredible complexity
1189580	1191340	of all the organs in the torso.
1191340	1194020	So everything is where it needs to be in the right place,
1194020	1195940	the right, you know, the right direction,
1195940	1197380	next to the right thing.
1197380	1198660	Almost all of the time,
1198660	1200520	where does this pattern come from?
1200520	1202780	Because we start life as a collection of blastomeres
1202860	1205220	and eventually these cells build something like this.
1205220	1206560	Where is that pattern?
1207740	1209660	People might be tempted to say DNA,
1209660	1211260	but we can read genomes now
1211260	1213620	and we know that is not what is in the genome.
1213620	1216020	What's in the genome are specifications of proteins,
1216020	1219660	the tiny molecular hardware that every cell gets to have.
1219660	1224660	But this structure is the outcome of the physiological software
1225660	1228180	that these cells are executing.
1228180	1231220	And so this information is no more in the genome
1231220	1236220	than is the actual structure of the colony of ants and termites
1238580	1241460	or the specific structure of a spider web
1241460	1243220	in the DNA of the spider.
1243220	1245860	So we have to really understand, okay,
1245860	1247860	how do the cells know what to make?
1247860	1249940	How do they know when to stop?
1249940	1250860	If something is damaged,
1250860	1252780	how do we convince them to repair it?
1252780	1255180	And actually, which I'll show you a little bit towards the end,
1255180	1257740	what else is that hardware willing to do?
1257740	1258780	What else can it build?
1258780	1260900	What can we make from the exact same cells
1260900	1263060	with the exact same DNA?
1263060	1266140	And now I like to think of kind of the end game
1266140	1268180	of our field here as this.
1268180	1270540	Someday, you're going to be able to sit down
1270540	1271500	in front of a computer
1271500	1274060	and use something called an anatomical compiler.
1274060	1276780	What's gonna happen here is that you will draw
1276780	1280460	the animal, plant, or a biobot, organoid, whatever
1281540	1283220	that you want at the level of anatomy,
1283220	1285540	not at the level of genetic circuits or anything like that,
1285540	1286860	but the actual anatomy.
1286860	1288380	And what the system ought to be able to do
1288420	1291300	is to compile down that anatomical description
1291300	1295340	into a specific set of stimuli
1295340	1296780	that have to be given to cells
1296780	1298980	to build exactly what you want to build.
1298980	1302020	Now, the practical reason we need something like this
1302020	1304100	is because imagine if you had the ability
1304100	1306540	to tell groups of cells what to build,
1306540	1309100	you would do away with birth defects.
1309100	1310340	You would be able to heal
1310340	1312380	and regenerate after traumatic injury.
1312380	1313660	You could reprogram cancer.
1313660	1315300	You could stop and reverse aging,
1315300	1317100	even stop degenerative disease.
1317100	1317940	All of these things,
1317940	1320540	all of these major problems of biomedicine would go away
1320540	1323060	if we understood how to get a group of cells
1323060	1325100	to build exactly what we want them to build.
1325100	1327100	Now, the key here is that this device
1327100	1328340	is not a 3D printer,
1328340	1330180	which is not about micromanaging cells
1330180	1332060	and trying to print body structures.
1332060	1333740	It's a communications device.
1333740	1337060	It's a way to translate your anatomical specification,
1337060	1338460	what it is that you're looking for,
1338460	1341220	into the gold states that these cells are accessing
1341220	1343540	when they build some particular structure.
1343540	1345420	Now, I'll tell you that we don't have anything
1345420	1346820	remotely like this.
1346820	1350020	And we can only do this in a few individual cases.
1350020	1351500	And the reason is,
1351500	1354980	is that here's where current state of the art is.
1354980	1358420	We're very good at manipulating cells and molecules,
1358420	1360220	processing information like this about
1360220	1362060	which genes interact with which other genes,
1362060	1364420	which proteins attach together and so on.
1364420	1367100	But we're really a long way away from what we really want,
1367100	1370020	which is complete control of large scale form and function.
1370020	1371580	Somebody is missing a limb.
1371580	1373780	We ought to be able to tell those cells to rebuild.
1373780	1375180	So why is that?
1375180	1377500	And I think it's because molecular medicine
1377500	1380300	has been largely stuck where computer science
1380300	1382340	was in the 1940s and 50s.
1382340	1384340	This is what it looks like,
1384340	1388020	that programming a computer used to look like.
1388020	1388860	You can see what she's doing.
1388860	1391060	She's interacting with the hardware.
1391060	1393780	She's rewiring the machine to get it to do something.
1393780	1395380	And you would all laugh if I told you
1395380	1397980	that on your laptops, nowadays,
1397980	1400340	if you wanted to go from Microsoft Word to Photoshop,
1400340	1401900	you would have to get out to soldering iron
1401900	1403460	and start rewiring.
1403460	1406980	The whole point of what we've learned
1406980	1409660	in computer science and information technology
1409660	1412460	over the years is that if your hardware is good enough
1412460	1415380	and the biological hardware is definitely good enough,
1415380	1418860	what you have here is a reprogrammable medium
1418860	1421540	that is much better off controlled by communication,
1421540	1423100	by signals, by stimuli.
1423100	1424700	And this is what we're still missing
1424700	1427020	out to a large degree in biomedicine.
1427020	1429500	We understand the hardware more or less.
1429500	1431820	We really have only begun to scratch the surface
1431860	1435100	of the software, the software of life, the intelligence
1435100	1439940	that's inherent in every layer of our body systems.
1439940	1442100	I'm gonna show you a couple of examples of this.
1442100	1445100	Well, first of all, we all know that development is reliable.
1445100	1447740	So most of the time, the egg will give rise
1447740	1449060	to a bunch of cells that build
1449060	1451260	the correct human target morphology.
1451260	1454660	But it's not just about emergent complexity or reliability.
1454660	1456540	It's actually much more interesting than that.
1456540	1460380	Because if you start cutting early embryos into pieces,
1460460	1462100	this is naturally how you get twins
1462100	1463180	and triplets and quadruplets.
1463180	1464940	You don't get half bodies,
1464940	1467580	you get perfectly normal monozygotic twins
1467580	1468900	and various multiples.
1468900	1471140	And this means that in this anatomical space
1471140	1473660	where you go from different starting states,
1473660	1476180	here's one, here's one, from different starting states,
1476180	1478220	all of them can navigate that space
1478220	1480220	to a particular ensemble of goal states
1480220	1482740	corresponding to valid human anatomies.
1482740	1485540	And sometimes they can actually avoid
1485540	1486820	all kinds of local minimum,
1486820	1489580	meaning perturbations that you give them along the way.
1489580	1492500	They can solve problems and get where they need to go.
1492500	1494940	This is William James' definition of intelligence,
1494940	1497780	the ability to get to the same end by different means.
1497780	1500900	This is what I mean by different types of intelligence
1500900	1503260	by navigating these problem spaces.
1503260	1505340	Now, some animals can do this throughout their lifespan.
1505340	1508300	So here is an axolotl and these amphibians
1508300	1511860	can regenerate their eyes, their jaws, their tails,
1511860	1514780	their limbs, portions of the heart and brain.
1514780	1517260	And what that looks like is when they bite each other's legs
1517260	1519140	off, no matter where that occurs,
1519140	1522700	whatever the piece is remaining,
1522700	1525220	these cells will build exactly what's needed,
1525220	1528300	no more, no less, to make a perfect salamander limb
1528300	1529500	and then they stop.
1529500	1531820	And that's the most amazing thing about regeneration
1531820	1533660	is that it knows when to stop.
1533660	1537100	And so this idea that you have a particular structure
1537100	1538980	and when you deviate from that structure,
1538980	1540940	the cells work really hard to get back
1540940	1544020	to that same region of anatomical space
1544020	1545700	and then they know that they've got there
1545700	1548660	and they know that that's their goal and then they stop.
1548660	1551540	So that is a kind of anatomical homeostasis.
1551540	1553940	It's the same thing that your thermostat does at home
1553940	1555180	where you set a set point.
1555180	1556420	And when the temperature goes off,
1556420	1559700	the system will work hard to get you back to that goal state
1559700	1561700	and then it stops, okay?
1561700	1564620	And by the way, this is not just this kind of regeneration,
1564620	1565980	it's not just for amphibians.
1565980	1568180	The human liver is highly regenerative.
1568180	1569740	Even the ancient Greeks knew that,
1569740	1572180	I have no idea how they knew that, but they did.
1572180	1575660	Deer every year will regenerate huge amounts of bone
1575660	1577380	and vasculature and innervation
1577420	1578980	when they regrow their antlers
1578980	1583620	up to a centimeter and a half of new bone per day they grow.
1583620	1588180	And even human children can regenerate their fingertips.
1588180	1590540	So if you just keep it clean,
1590540	1592340	these kind of amputations and kids end up
1592340	1594580	with a very nice cosmetic outcome.
1594580	1596100	So, but we're of course not as good
1596100	1598540	as salamanders or plenarium.
1598540	1602820	So I want to show you just kind of one of my favorite examples
1602820	1606540	to really try to bring home just how much amazing
1606620	1608940	creative problem solving these systems have.
1608940	1611980	This is a schematic of a cross-section
1611980	1615420	through a kidney tubule of a salamander.
1615420	1617420	And what you see here is that about eight to 10 cells
1617420	1619460	work together to build the structure
1619460	1620740	and then they leave a lumen in the middle
1620740	1622460	through which the fluid has to go.
1622460	1624820	One thing you can do is you can force these cells early on
1624820	1627740	to have way more genetic material than they should.
1627740	1629940	And when that happens, the nuclei get bigger
1629940	1632260	and the cells get bigger to accommodate.
1632260	1634460	When that happens, the resulting newt
1634460	1636100	is actually exactly the same size
1636140	1637500	because the cells adjust.
1637500	1640260	Fewer of these larger cells are now getting together
1640260	1642700	to make exactly the same lumen.
1642700	1644220	The most amazing thing happens
1644220	1646260	when you make these cells truly gigantic,
1646260	1649340	then it uses a completely different molecular mechanism
1649340	1652220	such that only one cell wraps around itself
1652220	1653540	leaving a hole in the middle
1653540	1655820	and still gives you the exact same structure.
1655820	1656820	So think of what this means.
1656820	1659540	If you're a newt coming into the world,
1659540	1661180	you don't know how many copies
1661180	1663060	of your genetic material you're going to have.
1663060	1664700	You don't know how big your cells are going to be.
1664700	1666940	You don't know how many cells you're going to have.
1666940	1667780	You have to figure out,
1667780	1669500	you have to use all the tools that you're disposing,
1669500	1671700	all the molecular mechanisms that you have
1671700	1672700	to solve this problem.
1672700	1675500	How do I get from being an egg to being an adult
1675500	1676700	despite all these novelties?
1676700	1678620	You can't count on anything.
1678620	1680780	You can't assume that your evolutionary history
1680780	1683860	has prepared you for knowing what to do.
1683860	1686060	And the same thing happens in the transition
1686060	1689260	from tadpole to frog.
1689260	1691860	They have to rearrange their whole face,
1691860	1693660	but these Picasso tadpoles,
1693700	1696540	which have the organs in abnormal locations.
1696540	1697780	So the eyes on the back of the head,
1697780	1699220	the mouth is off to the side.
1699220	1701700	These guys still make quite normal frogs
1701700	1705660	because all of these organs will move in unnatural paths
1705660	1707020	to get to where they need to go
1707020	1709340	to look like a good frog and then they stop.
1709340	1713460	So this means that genetics does not actually give you
1713460	1716500	some kind of hardwired automatic process
1716500	1718660	that just goes in the same direction.
1719820	1721420	What it does encode is a machine
1721460	1723980	that can do an error minimization scheme.
1723980	1726300	It can actually get to where it needs to go
1726300	1728260	despite all sorts of things going wrong.
1728260	1729780	So now this raises an obvious question.
1729780	1731260	How does it know what's right?
1731260	1734460	How do these things know what a correct frog face looks like?
1734460	1738740	So we've been studying this and the sort of
1738740	1742420	uncontroversial example of collections of cells
1742420	1744700	storing a goal state for behavior
1744700	1746020	is what happens in the brain.
1746020	1747180	So the way it works in the brain
1747180	1749180	is that you have these electrical networks
1749180	1752420	of cells that communicate electrically
1752420	1755020	via ions that go in and out of these little ion channels
1755020	1757500	and then they pass through these electrical synapses
1757500	1761620	and the computations that are processed by that network
1761620	1765420	result in the software that we see as behavior.
1765420	1769620	So basically here, this is a living zebrafish brain
1769620	1771900	that the commitment of neuroscience
1771900	1773540	is that if we knew how to decode
1773540	1776220	all of this electrophysiological activity,
1776220	1778300	we could read out the thoughts, the memories,
1778300	1782700	the goal states, the competencies of this animal.
1782700	1785780	Well, it turns out that this is not anything special
1785780	1788060	or unique to brains.
1788060	1790340	Every cell in your body has these ion channels.
1790340	1793220	Most cells have electrical connections to their neighbors
1793220	1796020	and evolution discovered that these electrical networks
1796020	1797980	were good for processing information
1797980	1799260	a really long time ago,
1799260	1802060	back around the beginning of bacterial biofilms
1802060	1804860	actually long before multicellularity
1804860	1806820	or brains or nerves or anything like that.
1806820	1808460	So then one can ask,
1808460	1811380	well, if the electrical networks of the brain
1811380	1814420	think about moving you through three-dimensional space,
1814420	1817140	what do the electrical networks of the body think about?
1817140	1821300	What were these cells thinking about before there were brains?
1821300	1823180	And what we've been studying is this idea
1823180	1824060	that what they're thinking about
1824060	1826340	is how to navigate anatomical space.
1826340	1828420	They're thinking about how to get from
1828420	1830580	whatever situation they happen to be in,
1830580	1832860	whether a normal egg or some kind of perturbed system
1832860	1835700	into the right kind of body for the environment
1835780	1837020	in which they find themselves.
1837020	1838660	So in order to do this,
1838660	1840740	we've developed some interesting techniques
1840740	1843060	using voltage-sensitive fluorescent dyes
1843060	1846740	to really literally read the mind of the body
1846740	1848820	to see all the electrical conversations
1848820	1849940	that cells are having with each other.
1849940	1851100	So these are not computer models.
1851100	1853420	These are real, you know, these are some cells
1853420	1856380	and this is an early frog embryo and the colors
1856380	1859340	are signals from a voltage reporter dye
1859340	1862580	that enables us to see what all the electrical states are.
1862580	1864060	We are reading it.
1864060	1865700	We then have all these computer models
1865700	1868460	that we use to try to understand and try to decode
1868460	1870580	what are the memories here.
1870580	1873380	And I'm going to show you some examples.
1873380	1876540	This is an early frog embryo putting its face together.
1877580	1881020	It's quite dynamic, but here's one frame from that video.
1881020	1883180	And you can see the bioelectric pattern here.
1883180	1884300	We call this the electric face
1884300	1886940	because it basically looks like a face.
1886940	1888900	Here's where it knows the eye needs to go.
1888900	1890620	Here's where the mouth needs to go.
1890620	1892340	Some other organs out here.
1892340	1895580	This is where the organs are going to be in the future.
1895580	1898460	This is a pre-pattern that it uses to figure out
1898460	1900460	where to put all the craniofacial organs.
1900460	1903260	Now, it's not just cells within an embryo that communicate
1903260	1906460	but actually individual embryos communicate with each other.
1906460	1908140	So you can see what's happening here in the group
1908140	1912420	that when this guy sets off a wave, they all feel it.
1912420	1914060	And here are a bunch of cells where you can see
1914060	1916460	there's some neural firing here,
1916460	1918660	but there are also some lots of activity
1918660	1920420	in these non-neural cells.
1920580	1923580	So these are pretty ubiquitous.
1923580	1925700	These electrical networks are pretty ubiquitous.
1925700	1929300	Now, observing these amazing bioelectrical signals
1929300	1931260	is fun in the reading,
1931260	1933980	but you don't know that the patterns mean anything
1933980	1935980	unless you can functionally alter them.
1935980	1938420	You alter them and you see what happens.
1938420	1943340	So we've developed tools mostly borrowed from neuroscience.
1943340	1944700	And I think one of the lessons we're learning
1944700	1947540	is that neuroscience is really not about neurons at all.
1947540	1949220	The deep lessons of neuroscience
1949260	1953260	tell us about all cells and body intelligence more broadly.
1953260	1956580	And what we do is we change these bioelectrical patterns.
1956580	1959660	We don't use, there are no electrodes,
1959660	1962060	there are no magnets, no waves, no frequencies,
1962060	1963900	no electromagnetic radiation.
1963900	1966900	What we do is we hack the normal interface
1966900	1969620	that cells are using to hack each other's behavior,
1969620	1971780	which is the ion channels on their surface
1971780	1973020	and the gap junctions that they use
1973020	1974620	to exchange electrical signals.
1974620	1975820	This is what we target.
1975820	1977540	So we control how cells communicate
1977540	1979100	with each other electrically.
1979100	1981940	And when you do this, you can do some really cool things.
1981940	1984060	For example, by injecting some RNA
1984060	1985820	and coding a potassium channel,
1985820	1987900	which changes the voltage of the cells,
1987900	1989940	we can induce a little spot in the sombrero
1989940	1992740	that looks just like that eye spot in that electric face.
1992740	1994140	But when you do that somewhere else,
1994140	1997740	for example, in cells that are going to become gut,
1997740	2000860	what you've just done is tell these cells, build an eye here.
2000860	2004580	You have not said anything about how the eye should form,
2004580	2006380	what are the components of an eye.
2006380	2008000	You haven't said anything to the stem cells
2008000	2011280	or to the specific genes inside of each one.
2011280	2013600	You're talking to the collective,
2013600	2016480	to the collective intelligence of cells
2016480	2018480	that are trying to navigate morphospace.
2018480	2020520	And what you've said is go to the region
2020520	2022440	that corresponds to making an eye.
2022440	2024080	And they know how to do this.
2024080	2027800	Here are all the internal tissues of these eyes,
2027800	2030040	so lens, retina, optic nerve, all that.
2030040	2032240	And they even have some other cool properties
2032240	2034360	that you find in other collective intelligences,
2034360	2035920	like ants, which is that,
2035920	2039040	so here's a lens sitting out in the flank of a tadpole
2039040	2042040	somewhere, if you inject just a few cells,
2042040	2043640	not enough to really make a whole eye,
2043640	2045400	so the blue ones are the ones we injected,
2045400	2047620	what they will do is recruit their neighbors.
2047620	2048640	They tell their neighbors that,
2048640	2051240	hey, you need to participate with us in making this eye
2051240	2052640	and they instruct them.
2052640	2054940	So we instruct these cells, you should make an eye,
2054940	2057560	they then instruct their neighbors.
2057560	2058760	So all of these competencies,
2058760	2060640	knowing how to make an eye,
2060640	2063160	knowing how many cells there are in recruiting new cells
2063160	2065560	if they need to, all of this is built in
2065600	2067400	as part of the competency of the material
2067400	2068600	that we're dealing with.
2068600	2072780	And we have extended this towards some regenerative
2072780	2075720	applications, there are huge numbers of people living
2075720	2078680	with limb and organ loss every day.
2079560	2081360	We need therapeutics that are not just going to be
2081360	2084780	for wound healing, but actually to regenerate whole organs.
2084780	2087480	And we can see here that what happens here,
2087480	2089160	normally frogs, unlike salamanders,
2089160	2090840	do not regenerate their legs,
2090840	2094680	but we've come up with a cocktail that triggers
2094720	2096640	not only pro-regenerative gene expression here,
2096640	2099280	but actually within 45 days,
2099280	2102200	you've already got some toes in the toenail.
2102200	2104360	But in our latest experiments,
2104360	2106200	what happens is that the treatment itself,
2106200	2110160	the bioelectric cocktail is applied for about 24 hours.
2110160	2112440	After that, you get a year and a half of leg growth
2112440	2113480	in the adult fraud.
2113480	2115440	You don't touch it at all during that time.
2115440	2116840	This is not about micromanaging,
2116840	2118920	this is not about controlling the stem cells
2118920	2120280	or 3D printing anything.
2120280	2122840	This is about telling the cells very early on,
2122840	2126000	go down the leg regeneration path, not the scarring path.
2126000	2127600	And so eventually you get a quite nice leg
2127600	2129840	that is touch sensitive and motile.
2131040	2134280	We are in the process of moving this to mammals now.
2134280	2136440	I should say that I have to do disclosure here
2136440	2139920	because Dave Kaplan and I have a company
2139920	2141880	whose job it is to try to move this
2141880	2144880	into a mammalian models and hopefully patients.
2144880	2148060	And David's group makes these wearable bioreactors
2148060	2151800	that apply the ion channel drug payload.
2151800	2155240	And come back to the plan area for a moment
2155240	2157040	because there's something really interesting here
2157040	2160120	about how we reprogram these pattern memories.
2160120	2164200	And I want to show you the plasticity of the material
2164200	2165200	that we're dealing with.
2165200	2167600	So here are the plan area that I was telling you
2167600	2169520	about some amazing properties
2169520	2171920	that we can talk about if people have questions
2171920	2174720	as far as cancer resistance, immortality.
2174720	2178480	I mean, these guys literally don't seem to age and so on.
2178480	2180320	But one of the things that we need to understand
2181280	2184440	is if they were to be chopped into three pieces,
2184440	2186440	so you got this middle fragment here,
2187760	2190440	100% of the time it grows one head and one tail
2190440	2191960	and you get a normal plan area.
2191960	2193360	So another question is how does it know?
2193360	2195400	How does this thing know how many heads it's supposed to have
2195400	2197680	and where the heads are supposed to be?
2197680	2199680	So it turns out that there's an electrical circuit
2199680	2201880	that controls this and we've characterized that circuit
2201880	2203480	and we've learned to rewrite it.
2203480	2207360	So that what happens here is that this bioelectrical pattern,
2207360	2209900	so this is the memory, this is literally the memory
2209900	2211820	of the collective intelligence of the body
2211820	2213940	as far as how many heads it's supposed to have in here,
2213940	2214780	one head.
2214780	2217340	So what we can do is we can change that pattern to say,
2217340	2220300	no, two heads, and when you do that in this animal,
2220300	2223060	after you amputate, then it goes ahead
2223060	2224100	and makes a two-headed animal.
2224100	2226220	This isn't Photoshop or AI or anything like that,
2226220	2227500	these are real animals.
2227500	2230420	And this bioelectric pattern is not a map
2230420	2231940	of this two-headed guy.
2231940	2233940	This pattern is the pattern that we
2234940	2239780	have incepted into this one-headed normal worm.
2239780	2241460	It's anatomically normal,
2241460	2244260	the molecular gene expression is normal.
2244260	2246660	Here's where the head genes are.
2246660	2249620	But it has a different internal representation
2249620	2251900	of what a correct planarian should look like.
2251900	2254180	We've rewritten the goal, the target state.
2254180	2256560	So this is not micromanaging the cells,
2256560	2259020	this is changing the mind of this collective intelligence
2259020	2262180	as far as what I should do if I get injured in the future.
2262220	2264220	So it's really a counterfactual memory.
2264220	2267340	And one planarian body, a normal planarian body,
2267340	2271100	can store at least one of two possible representations
2271100	2273620	of what a normal worm should look like.
2273620	2276700	And in fact, one of the most remarkable things
2276700	2280940	is that once you do that, the memory stays.
2280940	2283880	Two-headed worms cut again and again in plain water
2283880	2287360	will continue to regenerate as two-headed animals.
2287360	2289460	It's permanent, even though there's nothing wrong
2289460	2290820	with the genetics of this animal.
2290820	2292060	We have not touched the genome,
2292060	2293740	there are no trans genes.
2293740	2295940	This is purely bioelectrical.
2295940	2299020	I showed you exactly where the electrical memory is stored
2299020	2300060	and how we can see it.
2300060	2303820	And here are these two-headed worms.
2303820	2306340	And not only can we change the number of heads,
2306340	2308160	but we can actually change the shape of the head
2308160	2309860	to that of other species.
2309860	2312900	So the shape of the head of this triangle species
2312900	2314940	can become flat like a Pifalina.
2314940	2317420	It can become round like an S-Mediterrania.
2317420	2320060	Shape of the brain changes like these other species.
2320060	2322780	The shape of the position of the stem cells does.
2322780	2326340	So in this anatomical morphospace where you have attractors,
2326340	2328220	you have these deep attractors corresponding
2328220	2330740	to other species, they live there naturally,
2330740	2333100	but you can get a different species, such as this guy,
2333100	2338100	to visit these other attractors because it's so reprogrammable.
2338260	2340100	Not only that, you can take it further
2340100	2345060	and find regions of morphospace where you know,
2345060	2347580	machine learning folks will call this a latent morphospace
2348140	2351620	where you can build things that are not normal plenaria
2351620	2354060	at all, things that are spiky or cylindrical
2354060	2355820	or combinations like this.
2355820	2358500	So what I'm showing you is that the body is incredibly plastic.
2358500	2360780	It's reprogrammable at the level of physiology,
2360780	2365780	not necessarily the genetically specified hardware,
2366660	2368660	but we are not the only bioengineers
2368660	2371300	that can hack this kind of morphogenetic navigation.
2371300	2373660	This is what you normally see.
2373660	2375620	Acorns make something like this.
2375620	2377540	And you kind of get that this is extremely reliable.
2377540	2379740	This happens so often that you get the idea that, okay,
2379740	2382420	well, the oak genome just knows how to do this.
2382420	2383940	This is what the oak genome knows how to do.
2383940	2385740	That is what they do every single time.
2385740	2389220	But there's this amazing bioengineer, this WASP,
2389220	2390060	and it's a parasite.
2390060	2394100	And what the parasite does is using some kind of chemicals
2394100	2396900	that are still poorly understood,
2396900	2399940	it basically hacks the surrounding plant cells
2399940	2401740	to build something completely different.
2401740	2404780	Would you have any idea that these flat,
2404780	2407740	the nice, flat green leaves with a normal genome,
2407740	2409220	a completely normal genome,
2409220	2412140	were capable of building something as crazy as this?
2412140	2413100	We'd have no idea.
2413100	2415420	And people talk about developmental constraints.
2415420	2417780	I don't, you know, there's a lot of constraints
2417780	2419260	in our thinking about the process,
2419260	2422540	but I'm not sure we understand morphogenic constraints at all.
2422540	2425580	I think they're much broader than people think.
2425580	2428980	And this kind of hacking is ubiquitous in biology,
2428980	2431060	and we are just learning to do it.
2431060	2435020	And with this notion of what lies beyond
2435020	2436820	the normal morphology, you know, repair,
2436820	2440980	repair of the typical anatomy, but what's beyond that?
2440980	2442300	And I wanna show you this,
2442300	2446180	basically this last example, which is this.
2446180	2448020	If I showed you this little organism,
2448020	2450100	and I would ask you to guess what this is,
2450100	2453220	you might say we've found this at the bottom of a pond
2453220	2457620	somewhere, it's some kind of primitive microorganism.
2457620	2459660	If you were to sequence the genome of this,
2459660	2462620	what you would get is 100% Homo sapiens.
2462620	2464620	This is what we call these anthrobots.
2464620	2468460	They are made of adult patient tracheal epithelia.
2468460	2472780	So adult often elderly patients donate their tracheal cells.
2472780	2475260	We have a protocol that lets these cells
2475260	2479860	reboot their multicellularity and live an entirely new life
2479860	2482900	that has new shapes and behaviors.
2482900	2487380	They look nothing like any stage of human development.
2487380	2489620	And one of the unique things that they know
2489620	2493420	how to do, which is really shocking and surprising,
2493420	2495900	is that they know how to heal neural wounds.
2495900	2498780	So if you put down some human neurons in addition,
2498780	2500980	you put a big scratch through them,
2500980	2503540	these anthrobots will sit down in this kind
2503540	2505260	of like super bot cluster.
2505260	2507620	And what you'll see when you lift them up four days later,
2507620	2509300	what they've done is they've taken the two sides
2509300	2511500	of the neural wound and they knit them together.
2511500	2513900	Who would have ever thought that your tracheal cells,
2513900	2516900	which sit there quietly for decades in your airway,
2516940	2518260	actually have given the opportunity
2518260	2521540	to make a multi little creature that runs around on its own
2522820	2525020	and has lots of interesting abilities,
2525020	2527860	such as, for example, healing neural wounds.
2527860	2529900	And so this one of the biomedical aspects of this
2529900	2533180	is that this is a personalized medicine
2533180	2536460	where cells from your own body, not genetically modified,
2536460	2538540	there's no reason to genetically modify them,
2539540	2543300	can be used to heal your own body from with,
2543300	2545940	and no need for, for example, eye immune suppression
2545980	2547140	because they're your own cells.
2547140	2548980	They're not some sort of heterologous cell type.
2548980	2551740	So this kind of agential biomedical intervention,
2551740	2555180	these kind of biobots made from your own cells to heal
2555180	2558740	are, I think, a huge potential application for the future.
2558740	2562660	So the last thing I'll just say is that,
2562660	2566820	not only do we have these two continuum that remind us
2566820	2571460	that we are on an unbroken, slow continuum
2571460	2574580	with all kinds of other unusual forms, including cells,
2574580	2576260	and whatever you say about adult humans,
2576260	2578820	you have to ask, what can you say
2578820	2581300	about some of these other intermediate forms?
2581300	2582940	But also there's another continuum here,
2582940	2587100	which consists of now rational changes that are made
2588020	2591380	for various kinds of modifications and augmentations.
2591380	2594540	So both technological and purely biological,
2594540	2596260	I think that the future belongs
2596260	2598140	to a kind of freedom of embodiment.
2598140	2601260	I think that this standard form,
2601260	2604140	that evolution just sort of happened to drop us off in,
2604500	2607260	is susceptible to degenerative brain disease
2607260	2609260	and limited IQ and limited lifespan
2609260	2613020	and susceptible to all kinds of the dumb bacterial infections
2613020	2615900	and lower back pain and bad vision and all these things.
2615900	2619420	I don't think we have any particular commitment
2619420	2621500	or allegiance to any of that.
2621500	2625300	We are going to be improving some of the bad hardware
2625300	2628660	and some of the bad firmware that evolution has left us with.
2628660	2631460	And at every level of organization,
2631460	2634980	you can think about augmenting these systems
2634980	2639060	that were designed by basically a random walk with selection
2639060	2641380	with rationally designed materials.
2641380	2645940	So I think that in the future, all of you, young people,
2645940	2650180	and I think, even I will get to see a bunch of this, I think,
2650180	2654820	will be living with a huge number of alien bodies and minds.
2654820	2659020	We already have some people that are some degree of cyborg.
2659020	2662700	We will have hybrids and chimeres and synthetic life forms.
2662700	2666660	And because of that kind of plasticity of life
2666660	2669180	that I showed you, that interoperability is huge.
2669180	2673900	So pretty much any combination of evolved material,
2673900	2676020	engineered material and software
2676020	2677940	is some kind of living agent.
2677940	2680500	And all of these things are going to have diverse bodies
2680500	2681900	and diverse minds.
2681900	2686300	And we really better step up and go well beyond
2686340	2691300	very ancient and crumbling rules of thumb
2691300	2693740	about how we deal with each other
2693740	2698780	in terms of what are you made of and how did you get here?
2698780	2700660	Those are the kinds of things that we ask
2700660	2702260	when we try to understand is something
2702260	2704860	a quote unquote machine that we can do whatever we want with
2704860	2709820	or is it a living organism to whom we owe certain kinds
2709820	2713140	of moral stances, those categories are going to go out the window
2713140	2716220	because there are going to be all sorts of forms
2716220	2720100	that challenge those superficial categories.
2720100	2722100	And what I think we're looking for is a kind of ethical
2722100	2724580	synthbiosis with a bunch of life forms
2724580	2727260	that are nowhere on the tree of life with us.
2727260	2729940	So I'm going to stop here and just say that
2729940	2733260	if anybody's interested in diving more into this stuff,
2733260	2736300	here are some kind of academic papers.
2736300	2739580	There's much more sort of general purpose writings
2739580	2741420	on this kind of thing at my blog.
2741420	2744060	I want to thank the people who did all the work.
2744060	2746620	So these are all the postdocs and the grad students
2746620	2750780	who did the biology that I showed you today.
2750780	2753460	We have lots of amazing collaborators.
2753460	2755820	None of this is possible without our technical support
2755820	2757980	personnel, our funders.
2757980	2759180	Again, I have to do a disclosure.
2759180	2762460	These are the companies that support our work
2762460	2764540	and most of all the model systems,
2764540	2767900	the animals and the microbes and so on
2767900	2770260	because they teach us everything here.
2770260	2772020	So yeah, thanks very much.
2775060	2779060	Thank you.
2779060	2782060	OK, I think we have time for some questions.
2782060	2785060	So we will start here.
2787060	2788060	Thank you.
2788060	2790060	This was very interesting.
2790060	2793060	If I understood correctly, you state
2793060	2798060	that these morphological plasticity and regenerative
2798060	2802060	plasticity is not really encoded in our genome,
2803060	2805060	but more in the bioelectrical properties
2805060	2808060	and activity of the cells or the organism.
2811060	2814060	However, the bioelectrical properties of an organism
2814060	2819060	or of a cell depend on the channels,
2819060	2821060	voltage dependent or independent channels
2821060	2825060	that are expressed by a given cell,
2825060	2827060	which are encoded in our genome.
2827060	2834060	So in a way, the bioelectrical properties
2834060	2836060	and therefore the all the morphological
2836060	2838060	plasticity and regenerative capacity
2838060	2841060	is encoded in our genome.
2841060	2843060	Well, let's think about it.
2843060	2847060	So certainly you need the hardware for any of it to work.
2847060	2849060	So without the hardware, without the channels,
2849060	2851060	none of this is going to work.
2851060	2854060	But encoded is a funny word.
2854060	2856060	Imagine, I don't know if you've ever seen this thing,
2856060	2857060	it's called a Galton board.
2857060	2859060	You can get it on Amazon for about 20 bucks.
2859060	2860060	It's a toy.
2860060	2862060	What it is, it's just imagine a board
2862060	2864060	and you bang a bunch of nails into it, right?
2864060	2866060	And then you take a bucket of marbles
2866060	2868060	and you dump it into the top of the board.
2868060	2870060	So the marbles go bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,
2870060	2871060	and they all land on the bottom.
2871060	2873060	What's the shape of the resulting marbles?
2873060	2876060	What you always get is this lovely bell curve.
2876060	2878060	It has a very particular shape to it.
2878060	2879060	And so you can ask yourself,
2879060	2882060	where is the shape of that bell curve encoded?
2882060	2886060	And so you can, certainly it's not going to appear
2886060	2889060	if you don't have the wood and the nails and the marbles,
2889060	2893060	but you can study the material of the wood and the nails
2893060	2894060	and everything else all day long.
2894060	2895060	What you're not going to find
2895060	2897060	is a direct encoding of that bell curve.
2897060	2899060	So the real question in all of this
2899060	2901060	is to go beyond the terminology.
2901060	2903060	I mean, I'm much less interested in terminology
2903060	2908060	and more interested in what kind of conceptual framework
2908060	2910060	lets us do better experiments
2910060	2912060	in order to get new capabilities.
2912060	2916060	So if you want to make changes,
2916060	2918060	if you want to induce repair,
2918060	2920060	you'll fix birth defects, normalize cancer,
2920060	2921060	which are all things we've done
2921060	2923060	that I didn't get a chance to talk about,
2923060	2924060	the question is that you're better off
2924060	2926060	thinking about the material, the hardware,
2926060	2928060	or are you better off understanding the software
2928060	2931060	that happens there and targeting that?
2931060	2934060	And that's exactly what I was trying to argue,
2934060	2936060	that all of modern molecular medicine
2936060	2939060	has done some amazing things with respect to hardware,
2939060	2942060	but most of what we are not able to do currently
2942060	2945060	is precisely because we've stayed at that level,
2945060	2947060	which computer science and information technology
2947060	2949060	left behind in the 40s.
2949060	2952060	So yes, the hardware is important,
2952060	2954060	but we don't all program with a soldering iron,
2954060	2958060	and that's exactly what I'm saying as far as these.
2958060	2961060	The reason we were able to do some of the things
2961060	2963060	that we've done, which had never been done before,
2963060	2968060	is precisely because we were able to adopt conceptual frameworks
2968060	2970060	from neuroscience and from other fields
2970060	2973060	that really take very seriously the guidance
2973060	2976060	of the final outcome, not by the hardware itself,
2976060	2979060	but by the software components
2979060	2982060	that are not actually directly encoded by the hardware,
2982060	2987060	but of course require it to function in the physical world.
2987060	2991060	Thank you.
2991060	2993060	Thank you for a very interesting talk.
2993060	2997060	My question was in relation to,
2997060	2999060	I guess you said it's not genetic,
2999060	3001060	it's more about the stimuli that you use
3001060	3004060	to change how the cells function
3004060	3006060	and turn into what they're supposed to be.
3006060	3008060	I'm wondering, like with those frogs
3008060	3012060	where you were able to reproduce most of a leg,
3012060	3016060	if you made generation one of the frogs,
3016060	3020060	which were able to, using the stimuli,
3020060	3022060	create this new leg,
3022060	3025060	would generation two of the offspring,
3025060	3028060	if you cut the leg, grow a new leg
3028060	3030060	because you've reprogrammed those cells
3030060	3033060	and at this point it is the genetic,
3033060	3035060	I know we're trying to understand the difference
3035060	3038060	between genetics and the stimuli,
3038060	3041060	but would generation two have the capability
3041060	3046060	and the cell memory to regrow that leg?
3046060	3048060	Yeah, great question.
3048060	3050060	We haven't done the experiment.
3050060	3053060	I don't really predict that it would
3053060	3058060	because I could sort of make up a mechanism
3058060	3060060	by which that would happen,
3060060	3063060	but I doubt it would be actually
3063060	3067060	that this would be transmitted to the next generation
3067060	3070060	through the egg and sperm and so on.
3070060	3072060	But there is an interesting example of what you're talking about,
3072060	3073060	which is in these planaria,
3073060	3075060	so we make these two-headed animals,
3075060	3077060	again, perfectly normal genetics.
3077060	3080060	That's another reason why the genome is insufficient for all this
3080060	3083060	because if you just sequence the genome of the two-headed
3083060	3085060	and the one-headed form, they're identical.
3085060	3088060	You would have no idea that you're looking at a two-headed worm.
3088060	3091060	It's simply not in the genetics for that reason.
3091060	3094060	Those two-headed worms, when they reproduce,
3094060	3097060	so the way these worms reproduce is they tear themselves in half,
3097060	3099060	so they just tear themselves in half
3099060	3101060	and they regenerate, now you've got two worms.
3101060	3103060	So that's their mode of reproduction
3103060	3105060	and under that mode of reproduction,
3105060	3108060	the offspring do in fact inherit the two-headed ones.
3108060	3110060	So that's how they form fission
3110060	3112060	and they create more two-headed worms permanently.
3112060	3115060	So you've made a permanent line of animals
3115060	3118060	that have a different anatomical structure
3118060	3120060	and you can imagine, we could throw it in the Charles River,
3120060	3122060	we wouldn't, but you could imagine
3122060	3124060	throwing it in the Charles River here in Boston
3124060	3125060	in a hundred years from now,
3125060	3127060	some scientists come along and they scoop up some samples
3127060	3129060	and they go, oh, cool.
3129060	3132060	Two-headed form and a one-headed form must be a speciation event.
3132060	3136060	Let's sequence the genome and see where the speciation event happened
3136060	3138060	and see the difference between them.
3138060	3139060	That is not where it is.
3139060	3141060	And so that kind of a thing does propagate
3141060	3145060	because the animals are not squeezing through a single,
3145060	3147060	kind of a bottleneck of a single egg cell.
3147060	3149060	So there's a chunk of the planarian
3149060	3151060	which now remembers that it's two-headed
3151060	3153060	and that chunk regrows into a new animal.
3153060	3156060	Can that pass through a single egg cell?
3156060	3158060	I don't know, we have no evidence that it can.
3158060	3160060	I could sort of imagine how it would happen,
3160060	3165060	but we haven't shown anything like that yet.
3166060	3169060	Hi, thank you for your talk.
3169060	3174060	My question is how you propose that this bio
3174060	3179060	or this electrical information is integrated in these organisms.
3179060	3184060	For context, I work on the PAC-6 regulatory genome.
3184060	3188060	So seeing these eyes kind of generate just solely
3188060	3191060	from electrical stimulus kind of makes me think
3191060	3195060	it's not the genes themselves, but the DNA outside these genes.
3195060	3197060	But I would love to hear your thoughts on that.
3197060	3199060	Yeah, great question.
3199060	3200060	So a couple things.
3200060	3203060	So first, just kind of a little inside baseball about PAC-6.
3203060	3206060	So in frog, and pardon me if you know all this,
3206060	3209060	but in frog, PAC-6 will only induce eyes
3209060	3211060	in the anterior rectoderm, right?
3211060	3212060	Just in the front of the head.
3212060	3215060	And if you actually look at the developmental biology textbook,
3215060	3218060	what they tell you is that while the anterior and rectoderm
3218060	3221060	are the only cells competent to become eyes,
3221060	3224060	because they probed it with the master iGinc PAC-6.
3224060	3226060	If you use PAC-6 as your stimulus,
3226060	3229060	it's true only the anterior and rectoderm can form eyes.
3229060	3235060	But if you probe the cells with a much more meaningful stimulus
3235060	3237060	to them, which is these bioelectrical states,
3237060	3239060	actually you find out that pretty much,
3239060	3242060	I mean we haven't found a region in the body that can't do it yet.
3242060	3246060	So these competencies, what we think of as competencies
3246060	3249060	are really relative to how much we've understood the material
3249060	3252060	we're working with and the limitations of the material
3252060	3254060	are often limitations of our understanding,
3254060	3256060	not the actual competency of the material.
3256060	3258060	So now how does it work?
3258060	3262060	So what we do know for all of these cases
3262060	3265060	is the molecular steps on a single cell level.
3265060	3267060	So we know that when we change the voltage,
3267060	3269060	we know the transduction machinery,
3269060	3272060	we know how that voltage is converted to second messenger pathways,
3272060	3274060	how those turn various genes on and off,
3274060	3278060	some of them have to do with other kinds of chromatin modifications.
3278060	3280060	We have all those steps.
3280060	3283060	All of that stuff, while it's important to know,
3283060	3285060	is really extremely unsatisfying
3285060	3289060	because the phenomenon itself is not a single cell phenomenon.
3289060	3292060	So what I'm truly interested in is not tracking down
3292060	3296060	how one cell's voltage turns on specific genes.
3296060	3300060	That's just part of the, I mean it's an important part,
3300060	3303060	but it's just part of the story because what you really want to understand
3303060	3308060	is okay, but why is the whole thing scaled correctly?
3308060	3311060	What's the difference between the hand and the foot?
3311060	3315060	Why the shape of a particular structure?
3315060	3318060	And so what we're doing now is we're using
3318060	3321060	computational models of network computations,
3321060	3323060	so not single cells but networks of cells,
3323060	3326060	that try to understand how the collective makes decisions
3326060	3328060	about its size and shape and things like that.
3328060	3331060	So there are for sure molecular stories to be told
3331060	3334060	about how the voltage turns genes on and off,
3334060	3337060	but what you really want is an understanding of
3337060	3339060	why a particular voltage kicks off,
3339060	3342060	eyes versus legs versus, and that whole conversation,
3342060	3346060	like what happens when we induce these eye spots?
3346060	3349060	There's a whole conversation that happens between those cells and their neighbors
3349060	3351060	because those cells are saying to their neighbors,
3351060	3354060	help us make an eye, and so we also need to understand
3354060	3357060	it's not enough to know why those cells turn on various genes.
3357060	3359060	We need to know what are they saying to their neighbors
3359060	3362060	and how many, and how do they know how many of them there are,
3362060	3364060	but those cells are actually saying back,
3364060	3367060	no, no, you should not be an eye, you need to be normal skin,
3367060	3369060	and that's a cancer suppression mechanism,
3369060	3372060	the cells that have weird voltages get told by their neighbors
3372060	3375060	through the gap junctions, they get communicated to try and normalize.
3375060	3378060	So there's a whole battle that's going on of identities
3378060	3380060	and it's not an identity on a cell level,
3380060	3383060	it's not stem cells trying to decide what cell type they should be,
3383060	3386060	it's large regions saying we are going to be an eye
3386060	3389060	versus we are going to be a leg or skin or whatever.
3389060	3393060	So it's a very multi-scale problem,
3393060	3395060	the same way that neuroscience is multi-scale,
3395060	3398060	where yeah, there are people who study synaptic proteins,
3398060	3402060	but there are also people who study psychiatric diseases
3402060	3404060	and psychoanalysis and so on,
3404060	3406060	and every step in between, all the network science
3406060	3408060	and in between those two levels,
3408060	3411060	this is going to be that kind of science, I think.
3417060	3418060	Thank you for your talk.
3418060	3420060	I have two questions.
3420060	3424060	One is what is the most frustrating thing for you
3424060	3428060	for this field to move forward, if it's not a secret?
3428060	3431060	And the other thing, maybe I missed it,
3431060	3435060	but did you mention how this electrical pathways
3435060	3439060	are programmed in the beginning, like initially,
3439060	3441060	because you changed them,
3441060	3445060	so there was something that gave them at birth?
3445060	3447060	Yeah, good question.
3447060	3450060	So in the frog,
3450060	3453060	we can watch them form from the moment of fertilization.
3453060	3457060	So what happens is that the process of fertilization
3457060	3461060	breaks symmetry and we've characterized this
3461060	3463060	from the very earliest stages,
3463060	3467060	how the various ion channels that are present
3467060	3470060	set up different kinds of electrical states
3470060	3472060	that start to perform different computations
3472060	3474060	and end up breaking symmetry,
3474060	3476060	amplifying that symmetry and then making decisions
3476060	3478060	who's going to be left, who's going to be right
3478060	3480060	for anterior, posterior, and so on.
3480060	3482060	So it's a combination of ways.
3482060	3484060	So where do these patterns come from?
3484060	3488060	Well, it's a combination of emergence
3488060	3490060	in the same way that Turing patterns, right?
3490060	3492060	So people who study chemical signals
3492060	3494060	have this formalism of Turing patterns,
3494060	3497060	which break symmetry and create order
3497060	3500060	out of well-mixed chemical media.
3500060	3502060	So some of it is emergent.
3502060	3504060	Some of it is, of course, constrained by the hardware.
3504060	3506060	So you need to have the appropriate,
3506060	3508060	as somebody was saying there,
3508060	3510060	you need to have the right hardware
3510060	3512060	that's sufficiently powerful to do it,
3512060	3514060	which means voltage-gated ion channels
3514060	3516060	and voltage-gated gap junctions and things like that.
3516060	3520060	And part of it comes from
3520060	3522060	wherever it is that mathematics comes from.
3522060	3524060	I mean, this is really a philosophical question,
3524060	3526060	but think about it.
3526060	3528060	If evolution...
3528060	3532060	Once evolution discovers a voltage-gated ion channel,
3532060	3534060	what you have there is a voltage-gated ion conductance,
3534060	3536060	which is basically a transistor.
3536060	3538060	If you have a couple of transistors, you can make a logic gate.
3538060	3540060	Once you make a logic gate,
3540060	3542060	you end up with a truth table that tells you
3542060	3544060	how information is processed by that logic gate.
3544060	3546060	You didn't have to evolve that truth table.
3546060	3548060	The truth table is given to you for free,
3548060	3550060	including things like the fact
3550060	3552060	that the NAND gate is universal
3552060	3554060	and various other cool computational properties.
3554060	3556060	All of that you get for free.
3556060	3558060	And you don't have to evolve it.
3558060	3560060	You get it from wherever it is that the laws of
3560060	3562060	computation, the laws of mathematics,
3562060	3564060	the same way that if evolution discovers
3564060	3566060	two angles of the correct triangle,
3566060	3568060	it doesn't need to look for the third.
3568060	3570060	It can save all that time.
3570060	3572060	You know what the third is going to be.
3572060	3574060	So there are all of these interesting free lunches,
3574060	3576060	in a sense, that evolution gets to exploit.
3576060	3578060	And I don't know where they come from.
3578060	3580060	Plato and Pythagoras
3580060	3582060	thought that they come from this platonic space
3582060	3584060	of universal facts
3584060	3586060	that exist separately from the physical world.
3586060	3588060	That's as good an answer as any at this point.
3590060	3592060	Okay, we have many questions.
3592060	3594060	So let's just keep the answers a little
3594060	3596060	so we can get everyone here.
3598060	3600060	Hi, my name is Angeline.
3600060	3602060	I'm currently studying neuroscience
3602060	3604060	at Columbia and
3604060	3606060	I want to know
3606060	3608060	I'd like to know what you think about
3608060	3610060	evolution as a mechanism
3610060	3612060	of design.
3612060	3614060	For example,
3614060	3616060	evolving a bot
3616060	3618060	like a bio bot
3618060	3620060	instead of designing it
3620060	3622060	or both designing
3622060	3624060	and evolving it
3624060	3626060	and
3626060	3628060	would you edit
3628060	3630060	hox genes?
3630060	3632060	Would you take advantage of epigenetics?
3632060	3634060	And also
3636060	3638060	you sort of preempted this
3638060	3640060	with your last answer.
3640060	3642060	What do you think
3644060	3646060	how do you think we can take advantage
3646060	3648060	of the vast computing potential
3648060	3650060	embodied in biological components
3650060	3652060	like membranes,
3652060	3654060	like as you just remarked
3654060	3656060	like logic gates
3656060	3658060	and ion voltage control
3658060	3660060	and voltage controlled ion channels
3660060	3662060	are basically the same thing
3662060	3664060	and there is a potential to program that.
3664060	3666060	Yeah.
3666060	3668060	Okay, so there was a lot there
3668060	3670060	and I guess I was asked to keep my answer short
3670060	3672060	so I'll do my best and just pick
3672060	3674060	one of the things you said.
3674060	3676060	So we are doing
3676060	3678060	a lot of work in programming both our xenobots
3678060	3680060	which are the frog version and the enthrobots
3680060	3682060	which are the human version.
3682060	3684060	We are not touching the hox genes.
3684060	3686060	We are not touching any of that stuff.
3686060	3688060	We are learning to
3688060	3690060	give them stimuli
3690060	3692060	and take advantage of the cell's natural
3692060	3694060	solving capacities.
3694060	3696060	We are training cells with rewards and punishments.
3696060	3698060	We are trying to understand
3698060	3700060	how they interpret various signals
3700060	3702060	that cause them to acquire
3702060	3704060	different shapes and functions
3704060	3706060	and we're trying to communicate that to the cells
3706060	3708060	and let them figure out
3708060	3710060	all the downstream molecular steps
3710060	3712060	that need to happen
3712060	3714060	to make it come through.
3714060	3716060	The thing with evolution
3716060	3718060	I'll just say one quick thing about evolution
3718060	3720060	which is that I think evolution works
3720060	3722060	completely differently
3722060	3724060	within a genital medium like this
3724060	3726060	that is able to solve problems
3726060	3728060	than it does with the standard story
3728060	3730060	of evolution
3730060	3732060	like over a passive medium
3732060	3734060	where the genotype determines the phenotype.
3734060	3736060	That middle software layer
3736060	3738060	that morphogenetic plasticity
3738060	3740060	that allows it to solve problems
3740060	3742060	makes evolution or dynamics completely different
3742060	3744060	because selection
3744060	3746060	has a hard time seeing actual genomes
3746060	3748060	than what it sees is the outcome
3748060	3750060	where you end up selecting for competency
3750060	3752060	not for actually better genomes
3752060	3754060	and that's an intelligence ratchet
3754060	3756060	that goes all the way from
3756060	3758060	developmental mechanisms all the way up
3758060	3760060	I think to behavioral intelligence.
3764060	3766060	Thank you for the talk.
3766060	3768060	I was wondering
3768060	3770060	if you consider like
3770060	3772060	moving the eye of the tadpole
3772060	3774060	from where it normally is to the leg
3774060	3776060	as a deviation from the norm
3776060	3778060	of deviations that can be handled
3778060	3780060	before the mechanisms just break down
3780060	3782060	and what's that threshold look like
3782060	3784060	if there is one?
3784060	3786060	We've never reached a threshold
3786060	3788060	I think that
3788060	3790060	I don't think there's
3790060	3792060	any kind of a threshold in that sense
3792060	3794060	you can certainly overwhelm
3794060	3796060	metabolically you can overwhelm the system
3796060	3798060	it needs a certain amount of energy
3798060	3800060	just to undergo morphogenesis
3800060	3802060	and of course
3802060	3804060	that plasticity is not unlimited
3804060	3806060	there are many things you can do to screw it up
3806060	3808060	so that it cannot fix itself
3808060	3810060	so birth defects are a thing
3810060	3812060	and that's because these are not infallible pathways
3812060	3814060	they adapt to a huge number of interventions
3814060	3816060	but of course it's not unlimited
3816060	3818060	so I think the limitation
3818060	3820060	is
3820060	3822060	it's not the number of things
3822060	3824060	things you change it's the kind of things
3824060	3826060	and whether or not you've broken the system's ability
3826060	3828060	to remember what the right shape is
3828060	3830060	and then act on it
3834060	3836060	Hi Michael
3836060	3838060	Fascinating topic, thank you so much
3838060	3840060	so
3840060	3842060	what I would like to better understand is
3842060	3844060	how do you think that such complex information
3844060	3846060	as the performance
3846060	3848060	of a task
3848060	3850060	can be encoded outside of the nervous system
3850060	3852060	since
3852060	3854060	in the nervous system we have synapses
3854060	3856060	and the fundamentals
3856060	3858060	of learning and memory
3858060	3860060	it's synaptic plasticity
3860060	3862060	the potential and depression
3862060	3864060	of synapses
3864060	3866060	so how do you think that such complex information
3866060	3868060	can be encoded
3868060	3870060	and modulated
3870060	3872060	through simply ion channels that don't have
3872060	3874060	synapses between them
3874060	3876060	to communicate information
3876060	3878060	well okay a few things
3878060	3880060	first of all I'm not suggesting that behavioral information
3880060	3882060	it relies entirely on ion channels
3882060	3884060	that's not what I've said
3884060	3886060	but they do actually cells
3886060	3888060	non-neural cells do have electrical synapses
3888060	3890060	between them, gap junctions
3890060	3892060	do store state and things like that
3892060	3894060	but overall
3894060	3896060	the story and I know this is the standard
3896060	3898060	story of neuroscience that it's this
3898060	3900060	synaptic plasticity and LTP and so on
3900060	3902060	that story, not from my work
3902060	3904060	but from lots of other people's work
3904060	3906060	that story is significantly cracking
3906060	3908060	at this point and I would recommend
3908060	3910060	the work of Sam Gershman
3910060	3912060	Randy Gallo still
3912060	3914060	David Glansman
3914060	3916060	to look at some alternatives because
3916060	3918060	I don't think that's
3918060	3920060	many people no longer think that that's the entire
3920060	3922060	story and overall
3922060	3924060	if I had to guess I think that
3924060	3926060	the vast majority of that machinery
3926060	3928060	that you're talking about is not actually for storing
3928060	3930060	memories I think it's for interpreting them
3930060	3932060	and I think that there are numerous
3932060	3934060	substrates within cells
3934060	3936060	neural and non-neural that basically act
3936060	3938060	like a
3938060	3940060	almost like a reservoir computing scenario
3940060	3942060	but a lot of the
3942060	3944060	actual degrees of freedom are in chemical
3944060	3946060	systems they're not necessarily
3946060	3948060	synaptic
3948060	3950060	and the neural
3950060	3952060	networks are actually there to try to interpret it
3952060	3954060	on the fly so that's
3954060	3956060	a long conversation
3956060	3958060	to have but look up some of those papers and you'll see
3958060	3960060	this is not my idea
3960060	3962060	this has been around for some decades now
3966060	3968060	Just keep your questions
3968060	3970060	and answers like we have like 10 more
3970060	3972060	questions so
3972060	3974060	Thank you so much for the talk
3974060	3976060	I'm curious
3976060	3978060	on your thoughts about
3978060	3980060	whether this electrical information
3980060	3982060	can be accessible
3982060	3984060	in higher order cognition and humans
3984060	3986060	might be in conscious perception
3986060	3988060	and other organisms that might look a little
3988060	3990060	different
3990060	3992060	Yeah I mean if I understood correctly
3992060	3994060	that's the project of neural
3994060	3996060	decoding so lots of neuroscientists
3996060	3998060	work on this idea of reading out
3998060	4000060	electrical information out of
4000060	4002060	mammalian brains or including
4002060	4004060	human brains to try and understand what the person
4004060	4006060	is thinking
4010060	4012060	Hi thanks for the talk I'm
4012060	4014060	I'm wondering when you say
4014060	4016060	all intelligence is collective intelligence
4016060	4018060	is there a sort of a principal
4018060	4020060	argument for that like can we imagine
4020060	4022060	intelligences that we haven't
4022060	4024060	discovered that could not be
4024060	4026060	collective like why are all
4026060	4028060	intelligences collective
4028060	4030060	Well
4030060	4032060	as far as we know
4032060	4034060	certainly on earth
4034060	4036060	every intelligence is made
4036060	4038060	of parts
4038060	4040060	I cannot I mean maybe somebody has
4040060	4042060	better imagination than me but I cannot imagine
4042060	4044060	a truly
4044060	4046060	sort of
4046060	4048060	homogenous monadic
4048060	4050060	single
4050060	4052060	single object that is not made of
4052060	4054060	parts that can change and that function relative
4054060	4056060	to each other and so on that could then
4056060	4058060	learn and
4058060	4060060	do the kinds of things we expect of intelligence
4060060	4062060	if it doesn't have internal parts that can change
4062060	4064060	state how is it learning anything
4064060	4066060	right it's not I just can't imagine
4066060	4068060	how you could possibly have a
4068060	4070060	intelligence that is
4070060	4072060	one indivisible thing that does not have
4072060	4074060	internal states that can change every intelligence
4074060	4076060	that we've ever seen every piece of
4076060	4078060	active matter and
4078060	4080060	intelligent living
4080060	4082060	thing that we've ever seen is composed of parts
4082060	4084060	composed of parts composed of parts
4084060	4086060	I just don't see how it would be
4086060	4088060	otherwise
4090060	4092060	good
4094060	4096060	hi yeah great talk
4096060	4098060	so I was curious about
4098060	4100060	have you done RNA
4100060	4102060	seek before and after for example
4102060	4104060	in that frog example
4104060	4106060	I'm curious if there are any
4106060	4108060	transcriptomic changes that you were able to see and
4108060	4110060	if so
4110060	4112060	what are your thoughts on oncogenesis
4112060	4114060	or oncogene activation
4114060	4116060	yeah we absolutely
4116060	4118060	we've done tons of RNA seek there are massive
4118060	4120060	transcriptional
4120060	4122060	remodeling events that happen after the kinds of things
4122060	4124060	that we do also naturally so
4124060	4126060	xenobots have a very different transcriptome from
4126060	4128060	frog embryos, anthropobots have an extremely
4128060	4130060	different transcriptome from
4130060	4132060	normal human
4132060	4134060	from the tissue that they came from
4134060	4136060	even though there are no genetic changes
4136060	4138060	no weird nanomaterials, no drugs, no trans genes
4138060	4140060	no certain synthetic circuits
4140060	4142060	so yeah massive
4142060	4144060	massive changes and as far as oncogenes
4144060	4146060	the story that I didn't tell you is that
4148060	4150060	there's a whole
4150060	4152060	way to look at cancer as a kind of
4152060	4154060	dissociative identity disorder of this collective intelligence
4154060	4156060	and what that means is that you can actually address it
4156060	4158060	not by trying to kill the cells
4158060	4160060	but by trying to reconnect them back
4160060	4162060	into the
4162060	4164060	into the electrical networks and so what we do
4164060	4166060	is we inject human oncogenes
4166060	4168060	like K-RAS mutations and so on
4168060	4170060	into these embryos normally they make
4170060	4172060	tumors but if we then
4172060	4174060	manage the electrical connectivity correctly
4174060	4176060	even though the oncoprotein is blazingly
4176060	4178060	expressed you don't get tumors you get
4178060	4180060	perfectly healthy tissue with cells that are
4180060	4182060	participating in the network activity
4182060	4184060	and doing what they're supposed to do so there is
4184060	4186060	there is a cancer therapeutic story
4186060	4188060	here as well
4190060	4192060	Hello Michael great talk
4192060	4194060	thank you very much so I'm a neurosurgeon
4194060	4196060	I have an interesting
4196060	4198060	observation that you might find
4198060	4200060	cool too
4200060	4202060	so we have had
4202060	4204060	patients that we operate on
4204060	4206060	say lose some function
4206060	4208060	speech and then
4208060	4210060	rehabilitate after six months they are back
4210060	4212060	they regain their speech back
4212060	4214060	and when we operate
4214060	4216060	on the same patient again
4216060	4218060	the same spot where we lost
4218060	4220060	speech last time
4220060	4222060	is completely
4222060	4224060	rejectable and no function change occurs
4224060	4226060	so this
4226060	4228060	this is very rare
4228060	4230060	I didn't I saw
4230060	4232060	this kind of phenomena happen three or four times
4232060	4234060	but I was
4234060	4236060	and I'm not familiar
4236060	4238060	with your field
4238060	4240060	but is there a paper
4240060	4242060	you can direct us something
4242060	4244060	that
4244060	4246060	describes what you are describing here
4246060	4248060	the morpho memory and
4248060	4250060	the regular memory
4250060	4252060	how do they work in the human brains
4252060	4254060	well
4254060	4256060	okay there are lots of papers
4256060	4258060	how they work in human brains
4258060	4260060	is very unclear because obviously
4260060	4262060	experiments are really hard
4262060	4264060	for ethical reasons you can't do this
4264060	4266060	in regular humans there is some clinical data
4266060	4268060	drop me an email
4268060	4270060	michael.levin at tufts.edu
4270060	4272060	send me an email and I will
4272060	4274060	shoot you some reprints of what we have
4278060	4280060	Hi professor what do you see is the biggest
4280060	4282060	problem we need to solve before
4282060	4284060	using this to program
4284060	4286060	organisms
4286060	4288060	the biggest problem is
4288060	4290060	conceptual the biggest problem
4290060	4292060	is developing an
4292060	4294060	understanding of
4294060	4296060	how we are going to
4296060	4298060	recognize and
4298060	4300060	communicate with a
4300060	4302060	collective intelligence
4302060	4304060	in the sense that even
4304060	4306060	we've done experiments with gene
4306060	4308060	even gene regulatory networks
4308060	4310060	without the rest of the cell
4310060	4312060	without changing promoters
4312060	4314060	without any of that just by their
4314060	4316060	dynamical properties have
4316060	4318060	6 different kinds of memory that they can do
4318060	4320060	including pavlovian conditioning
4320060	4322060	just grns on their own
4322060	4324060	the ability to recognize
4324060	4326060	that kind of property
4326060	4328060	and to learn to engineer with an
4328060	4330060	agential material not the way we've
4330060	4332060	engineered with passive materials
4332060	4334060	which we've done for millennia
4334060	4336060	but a material with an agenda
4336060	4338060	of goals and competencies
4338060	4340060	and problem solving skills
4340060	4342060	it's a completely different way of engineering
4342060	4344060	it's a communication and a collaboration
4344060	4346060	with your material it's not the kind of
4346060	4348060	micromanaging that we've been doing
4348060	4350060	since the beginning of the scientific enterprise
4350060	4352060	so those issues
4352060	4354060	are the biggest barrier
4358060	4360060	Thanks
4360060	4362060	I notice you guys mostly use endothelial
4362060	4364060	or epithelial tissues for like the xenobots
4364060	4366060	and from different species as well
4366060	4368060	is that just sort of purely methodological
4368060	4370060	opportunism or is there like a relationship
4370060	4372060	between behavioral plasticity
4372060	4374060	and the characteristic time scale
4374060	4376060	at which they divide it die and so on
4376060	4378060	yeah interesting
4378060	4380060	we've done everything
4380060	4382060	we've done mesodermendoderm
4382060	4384060	we've done human mesenchymal stem cells
4384060	4386060	the reason the bots are epithelial
4386060	4388060	is because
4388060	4390060	those are the tissues that are ciliated
4390060	4392060	and they have a little motile cilia
4392060	4394060	and that behavior
4394060	4396060	that allows them to swim
4396060	4398060	and to have visible behavior
4398060	4400060	now I also think that
4400060	4402060	there are many interesting behaviors that happen
4402060	4404060	in physiological and transcriptional spaces
4404060	4406060	but for our first outing of this stuff
4406060	4408060	it was important to have behaviors
4408060	4410060	that people can see and really recognize as behaviors
4410060	4412060	so for that you need them to be motile
4412060	4414060	which means cilia
4414060	4416060	which means epithelium
4416060	4418060	Thanks
4422060	4424060	Thanks for the talk I really enjoyed it
4424060	4426060	I had a sort of question about
4426060	4428060	the role of you mentioned membranes
4428060	4430060	were used to sort of predict the next
4430060	4432060	downstream series of events and
4432060	4434060	intercellular events that contribute to the gross
4434060	4436060	development what do you think of epigenetics
4436060	4438060	and how you would sort of encode that
4438060	4440060	in the computational model
4440060	4442060	and sort of what those next steps are
4442060	4444060	like methylation, alkylation
4444060	4446060	all those different types of things because
4446060	4448060	you accounted for membranes but not I guess
4448060	4450060	those types of changes and I guess more
4450060	4452060	basically how do you account
4452060	4454060	to encode those as
4454060	4456060	next steps that a computational model
4456060	4458060	might predict or even downstream
4458060	4460060	Yeah we have them in our model
4460060	4462060	so we know there are
4462060	4464060	acetylation and methylation events that are downstream
4464060	4466060	of the things we do
4466060	4468060	it's there
4468060	4470060	by itself it doesn't really add much
4470060	4472060	all of the
4472060	4474060	the kind of high level decisions
4474060	4476060	about what's going to happen
4476060	4478060	are made at least as far as we've
4478060	4480060	been able to see now they're made
4480060	4482060	at that electrophysiological level
4482060	4484060	all the gene expression changes
4484060	4486060	direct or indirect through chromatin
4486060	4488060	modification or downstream
4488060	4490060	yeah they're there you can model them
4490060	4492060	but they're not
4492060	4494060	they're not a great
4494060	4496060	target for modification
4496060	4498060	you know if you want
4498060	4500060	there's certain things that you can do that way
4500060	4502060	but typically if you want to make these large scale
4502060	4504060	changes you're much better off doing
4504060	4506060	it as high on that control
4506060	4508060	hierarchy as you can
4508060	4510060	by the time you get down to the chromatin modification
4510060	4512060	you are having to micromanage a lot
4512060	4514060	of things to get what you want
4520060	4522060	Hi
4522060	4524060	thank you for your talk
4524060	4526060	I was really interested in the conditions
4526060	4528060	of this kind of initial bioelectrical
4528060	4530060	field
4530060	4532060	you showed several examples
4532060	4534060	of for example cells
4534060	4536060	creating
4536060	4538060	like sending bioelectrical
4538060	4540060	signals amongst each other
4540060	4542060	in order to stimulate growth in a certain way
4542060	4544060	I'm wondering
4544060	4546060	when it came to maybe like the first
4546060	4548060	organisms or organisms in a vacuum
4548060	4550060	are we
4550060	4552060	kind of sending out certain frequencies
4552060	4554060	or electrical
4554060	4556060	stimuli
4556060	4558060	in order to simulate that
4558060	4560060	or what were those types of kind of
4560060	4562060	initial field conditions
4562060	4564060	Yeah, good question
4564060	4566060	I mean we are
4566060	4568060	living cells
4568060	4570060	put out all kinds of things across the electromagnetic
4570060	4572060	spectrum
4572060	4574060	ultra weak photon emission
4574060	4576060	all kinds of AC
4576060	4578060	weak magnetic
4578060	4580060	kinds of things
4580060	4582060	I don't study any of that
4582060	4584060	so I have no idea really
4584060	4586060	what the implications that would be
4586060	4588060	everything that I've shown you was
4588060	4590060	purely electrical there's no magnetic component
4590060	4592060	there's no waves
4592060	4594060	this is purely electrical and it propagates
4594060	4596060	through water so
4596060	4598060	the stuff that I showed you doesn't really
4598060	4600060	work through air
4600060	4602060	but having said that it is true
4602060	4604060	that living things do emit
4604060	4606060	electromagnetic radiation but I don't think
4606060	4608060	we know what it does
4608060	4610060	Thanks
4610060	4612060	Alright, last question
4614060	4616060	Thank you so much for this talk
4616060	4618060	just a quick question
4618060	4620060	about like because I guess you can
4620060	4622060	kind of call it
4622060	4624060	like a programming type of question
4624060	4626060	how would you
4626060	4628060	describe the type of bugs
4628060	4630060	that you encounter so to speak
4630060	4632060	in this situation so let's say you want to create
4632060	4634060	a worm with two heads
4634060	4636060	and the outcome is just different than what you expect
4636060	4638060	like how do you, first of all
4638060	4640060	I'm guessing you've seen that in a second
4640060	4642060	how do you deal with quote unquote debugging that
4642060	4644060	Yeah, great
4644060	4646060	the biggest issue here
4646060	4648060	is that you have to think
4648060	4650060	completely differently than you do
4650060	4652060	with regular programming because in regular
4652060	4654060	programming
4654060	4656060	at least most of the time
4656060	4658060	you're dealing with an obedient passive
4658060	4660060	medium so when you have a command
4660060	4662060	whatever that command may be
4662060	4664060	you are pretty much guaranteed that
4664060	4666060	the hardware is going to carry it out
4666060	4668060	it may be the right command, maybe the wrong command
4668060	4670060	but when you say add these two numbers
4670060	4672060	if your hardware
4672060	4674060	is not actually going to do it then
4674060	4676060	you don't have a good computer right
4676060	4678060	the whole point of hardware
4678060	4680060	is to isolate those layers so that
4680060	4682060	at the higher level you don't need to worry about
4682060	4684060	where the electrons are going you can assume
4684060	4686060	that the chip is doing what it needs to do
4686060	4688060	and it's going to get carried out
4688060	4690060	biology isn't like that at all so what's happening here
4690060	4692060	is that every level has its own agenda
4692060	4694060	so when you are providing certain signals
4694060	4696060	what you end up with are targets that
4696060	4698060	either aren't paying attention
4698060	4700060	or they are paying attention and they refuse
4700060	4702060	or they actually fight you on it
4702060	4704060	are they going to do something different
4704060	4706060	or they have some other thing that they want to do
4706060	4708060	and this happens at every level
4708060	4710060	it's not just behavioral
4710060	4712060	scientists know about this because
4712060	4714060	it's really hard to do experiments
4714060	4716060	because of individuality cells do this too
4716060	4718060	so you're dealing with a material that is not
4718060	4720060	a passive material that has
4720060	4722060	well separated levels
4722060	4724060	of abstraction where each
4724060	4726060	level can depend on the bottom level to be
4726060	4728060	perfectly obedient they are all pursuing
4728060	4730060	their own agendas they are cooperating
4730060	4732060	communicating with each other
4732060	4734060	interpreting each other
4734060	4736060	the computational paradigm that
4736060	4738060	Josh Bangar and I have come up with
4738060	4740060	is called polycomputing
4740060	4742060	and it's simply the idea that
4742060	4744060	you have a huge number of
4744060	4746060	coexisting
4746060	4748060	interpenetrating agents which are all
4748060	4750060	interpreting and hacking each other in different ways
4750060	4752060	so there's not a single
4752060	4754060	interpretation of what an event is actually
4754060	4756060	computing in our computing architectures
4756060	4758060	we all agree when there's an AND gate
4758060	4760060	this is this set of physical events that's an AND gate
4760060	4762060	it's computing it in biology you have
4762060	4764060	lots of little
4764060	4766060	observers inside the cells and the tissues
4766060	4768060	that are all
4768060	4770060	interpreting these events as completely
4770060	4772060	different computations and we as a third person
4772060	4774060	a sort of third party observer
4774060	4776060	often have absolutely no clue what they're doing
4776060	4778060	and that's really hard
4778060	4780060	it's a very different way of programming
4780060	4782060	amazing
4782060	4784060	well
4784060	4786060	what an amazing talk and
4786060	4788060	thank you so much for us give
4788060	4790060	another round of applause
4790060	4792060	thank you so much great questions
4792060	4794060	I really enjoyed the discussion
4794060	4796060	awesome
4796060	4798060	okay now
4798060	4800060	we will also talk a little bit about
4800060	4802060	decentralized science
4802060	4804060	and I'll follow up
4804060	4806060	you're welcome to stay or whatever is good
4806060	4808060	so
4808060	4810060	let me share this tab here
4810060	4812060	thanks everybody I've got to run
4812060	4814060	for the long day
4814060	4816060	thank you
4816060	4818060	thank you so much
4818060	4820060	great discussion
4820060	4822060	okay
4822060	4824060	so
4824060	4826060	let me switch over here
4826060	4828060	so
4828060	4830060	oh yeah so first off
4830060	4832060	decentralized science is important so the first
4832060	4834060	part of decentralized science is attracting more people
4834060	4836060	so if you enjoyed this event
4836060	4838060	or you wanted to share with
4838060	4840060	another person make sure to
4840060	4842060	and make sure to post it it really helps
4842060	4844060	us you can take out your phone
4844060	4846060	I hate to be annoying about it
4846060	4848060	but I want you to take out your phone and take a picture
4848060	4850060	and send it out to other people
4850060	4852060	it seems weird now
4852060	4854060	but
4854060	4856060	it helps
4856060	4858060	we have information about
4858060	4860060	I'm going to give you information on our neko
4860060	4862060	first
4862060	4864060	we want to thank the people who
4864060	4866060	gave us this space today which is alchemy
4866060	4868060	and they are
4868060	4870060	the most reliable way to build web3 apps
4870060	4872060	specifically
4872060	4874060	a keel college friend
4874060	4876060	who is very kind to
4876060	4878060	give us the space
4878060	4880060	don't need the space
4880060	4882060	so this is the dci nyc community
4882060	4884060	we have lots and lots of speakers
4884060	4886060	we've had this is the 14th one we've done
4886060	4888060	we've had
4888060	4890060	people on mushrooms
4890060	4892060	and blinded studies and b's
4892060	4894060	and ai and nft's
4894060	4896060	all sorts of things
4896060	4898060	and we have another one
4898060	4900060	we have a new community
4900060	4902060	now people take out their phone
4902060	4904060	we have a telegram group
4904060	4906060	so you can stay in touch
4906060	4908060	after the event with each other
4910060	4912060	just giving another hint here
4912060	4914060	if you have your phone out now
4914060	4916060	okay
4916060	4918060	we have a website so dci.nyc
4918060	4920060	we have all our previous events
4920060	4922060	there we have the videos
4922060	4924060	we record everything we post online
4924060	4926060	we have swag
4926060	4928060	other things like that
4928060	4930060	can you go back to the telegram?
4930060	4932060	oh yeah
4936060	4938060	cool
4938060	4940060	okay
4940060	4942060	this is our next event on august 1st
4942060	4944060	it's going to be amazing
4944060	4946060	there is going to be
4946060	4948060	it's on this guy who's like doing this like
4948060	4950060	he's like
4950060	4952060	supersize me remember that movie with like mcdonald's
4952060	4954060	and
4954060	4956060	he's going to be doing like supersize
4956060	4958060	supersize me but with like wearables
4958060	4960060	it's going to be really cool
4960060	4962060	I spoke with him a few times
4962060	4964060	and he's an interesting fellow
4964060	4966060	and he's developing like a new type of wearable
4966060	4968060	for your toilet
4968060	4970060	and he's trying to destroy
4970060	4972060	his gut right now and then heal it
4972060	4974060	and then track the process
4974060	4976060	and we're going to be the first ones to
4976060	4978060	hear about his poo
4978060	4980060	oh
4982060	4984060	this is one thing we're trying to do more of
4984060	4986060	like having like a volunteer group
4986060	4988060	right now it's
4988060	4990060	sort of like a
4990060	4992060	like a skeleton crew that's doing this
4992060	4994060	oh thank you brian for helping
4994060	4996060	tonight thank you
4998060	5000060	I love as well
5000060	5002060	problems on the video
5004060	5006060	and brian on the code also
5006060	5008060	and so
5008060	5010060	if you're interested in
5010060	5012060	volunteering
5012060	5014060	for the next event here
5014060	5016060	we'll get dinner, we'll assign roles
5016060	5018060	and you can help out the part more part of the crew
5018060	5020060	and pick speakers
5020060	5022060	what was it
5024060	5026060	I forgot to update this slide
5028060	5030060	okay so now I'm going to talk about
5030060	5032060	like why is
5032060	5034060	what is decentralized
5034060	5036060	I wanted to do this talk before
5036060	5038060	but he had a
5038060	5040060	professor 11 so we'll do this talk after
5040060	5042060	and I wanted to say
5042060	5044060	why is it important as
5044060	5046060	a society and as a humanity
5046060	5048060	that we like
5048060	5050060	decentralize science
5050060	5052060	so imagine like
5052060	5054060	right now universities
5054060	5056060	like science is like hugely beneficial
5056060	5058060	to humankind
5058060	5060060	so that's probably one of the best
5060060	5062060	metrics of progress
5062060	5064060	and right now like a lot of it
5064060	5066060	are done in like research and development labs
5066060	5068060	and it's done in
5068060	5070060	like universities
5070060	5072060	but the quality of the research
5072060	5074060	in these things is all very tightly kept
5074060	5076060	it's a secret and also
5076060	5078060	that
5078060	5080060	sometimes the quality of like
5080060	5082060	academic research is really bad
5082060	5084060	and it's like not reproducible
5084060	5086060	and imagine a world in which
5086060	5088060	like the internet was like a giant
5088060	5090060	lab where people could like
5090060	5092060	contribute data to it
5092060	5094060	and get rewarded for it
5094060	5096060	and I think that like this is not
5096060	5098060	too far off I think like
5098060	5100060	universities are you know not as important
5100060	5102060	as they were 30 years ago
5102060	5104060	where is that science and innovation going to happen
5104060	5106060	it's going to happen on the internet
5106060	5108060	and this is like extremely valuable
5108060	5110060	and the people that participate in it
5110060	5112060	should get rewarded for it
5112060	5114060	so with this sort of premise is like
5114060	5116060	if you want if you have this as your goal
5116060	5118060	what would be the easiest way to do it
5118060	5120060	is you would use this blockchain
5120060	5122060	instead of just for like
5122060	5124060	financial incentives or like
5124060	5126060	swapping tokens and like
5126060	5128060	you swap some bitcoin for some ethereum on uniswap
5128060	5130060	which is cool but like the underlying value
5130060	5132060	attached to each of the tokens is like
5132060	5134060	sort of arbitrary whereas if you
5134060	5136060	like instead use the blockchain
5136060	5138060	to assign each token
5138060	5140060	or assign to a research project or to
5140060	5142060	intellectual property or to a new drug
5142060	5144060	or to bio electricity
5144060	5146060	and then you allow people to like
5146060	5148060	swap those types of tokens
5148060	5150060	for the IP that's attached to those
5150060	5152060	or contribute to a research project
5152060	5154060	this could be really cool and
5154060	5156060	make new types of projects happen
5156060	5158060	and maybe fund things and I want to
5158060	5160060	emphasize that like this isn't far off
5160060	5162060	I don't think that we're that far off
5162060	5164060	from this sort of thing existing in the world
5164060	5166060	I think it could be within the next like two to five
5166060	5168060	years I think it's very possible
5168060	5170060	and then the other big thing that's changing around
5170060	5172060	like why this is possible now
5172060	5174060	is like
5174060	5176060	AI is like going to be a scientist
5176060	5178060	very shortly so the idea that
5178060	5180060	you're a PhD student and then you have
5180060	5182060	six years of knowledge and four years of
5182060	5184060	undergraduate in this very specific
5184060	5186060	domain is like passe
5186060	5188060	and now anyone can be a research
5188060	5190060	scientist with just
5190060	5192060	like access to charge EVT
5192060	5194060	and you can get up to speed very quickly
5194060	5196060	so in this like new decentralized
5196060	5198060	science thing I think
5198060	5200060	it's possible to have like a thousand times
5200060	5202060	the number of scientists that exist
5202060	5204060	today because
5204060	5206060	there's a lot of people who aren't part of
5206060	5208060	a university who want to become
5208060	5210060	like a scientist
5210060	5212060	people will be incentivized so that you don't have
5212060	5214060	to do it through like
5214060	5216060	like you get
5216060	5218060	like a crappy salary at a university
5218060	5220060	like no one wants that like people want to be
5220060	5222060	like incentivized to do really great work
5222060	5224060	and so I think
5224060	5226060	that this is very possible to have like
5226060	5228060	wealthy scientists and a lot more of them
5228060	5230060	and like similar to how like
5230060	5232060	maybe like 30 years ago or 40 years ago
5232060	5234060	like there's only a couple computer programmers
5234060	5236060	but then like computers became
5236060	5238060	cheaper, GitHub became available
5238060	5240060	tools became easier to use
5240060	5242060	and then there's like everyone is a programmer
5242060	5244060	today and I think the same thing is sort of
5244060	5246060	we're on the cusp of that for
5246060	5248060	science so
5248060	5250060	um
5250060	5252060	uh it's like
5252060	5254060	like d-science is going to do for science
5254060	5256060	like it's going to decentralize science but
5256060	5258060	how many people know what d-phi is just in general
5258060	5260060	decentralized okay a lot
5260060	5262060	d-phi is like decentralizing finance
5262060	5264060	so that's like the idea of that
5264060	5266060	instead of like opening a bank account at
5266060	5268060	Wells Fargo there's probably a lot of people
5268060	5270060	who can't open a bank account
5270060	5272060	who would like to be banked and so
5272060	5274060	having like an ethereum wallet
5274060	5276060	a bitcoin wallet address or an ethereum address
5276060	5278060	and allowing them to swap different tokens
5278060	5280060	opening this up to a lot more people
5280060	5282060	and also remove a lot of the middlemen
5282060	5284060	so
5284060	5286060	here's a little table I made
5286060	5288060	we call this traditional science on the right
5288060	5290060	and decentralized science
5290060	5292060	on the left and I
5292060	5294060	I start off with this is just sort of
5294060	5296060	the process of
5296060	5298060	um a typical science
5298060	5300060	application so
5300060	5302060	the first thing is funding so
5302060	5304060	I hate funding because like normally
5304060	5306060	if you're not getting funded as a scientist
5306060	5308060	it means like I've never seen like
5308060	5310060	a really talented scientist complain about funding
5310060	5312060	so it means like something else is wrong
5312060	5314060	but it's the first thing here so
5314060	5316060	I'll start with it so the funding is like
5316060	5318060	a lot of funding happens because
5318060	5320060	governments are fund a lot of research
5320060	5322060	so like um the national science
5322060	5324060	foundation or the national institute of health
5324060	5326060	and the problem with that is like
5326060	5328060	they just fund very specific things
5328060	5330060	and they don't go broad and they only
5330060	5332060	fund things that they know they don't fund moon shot ideas
5332060	5334060	but in d-side
5334060	5336060	um you have access to a lot more
5336060	5338060	people so you can crowd fund ideas
5338060	5340060	and you can do a lot more crazy stuff
5340060	5342060	publications
5342060	5344060	are very broken in traditional science
5344060	5346060	so
5346060	5348060	publications in traditional science
5348060	5350060	go through a peer review but the peer reviewers
5350060	5352060	don't actually read the papers they just sort of
5352060	5354060	look at it and move on
5354060	5356060	um in d-side
5356060	5358060	anyone can be a peer reviewer and you can like bet
5358060	5360060	on individual contributions
5360060	5362060	um then uh
5362060	5364060	data sharing so in traditional science
5364060	5366060	data is very locked and in d-side
5366060	5368060	the data sets are like open
5368060	5370060	and you can pay and reproduce experiments very easily
5370060	5372060	um community
5372060	5374060	uh like
5374060	5376060	in a traditional science setting like
5376060	5378060	you only have you only sort of do research
5378060	5380060	within the lab setting but in d-side
5380060	5382060	um you have a global
5382060	5384060	access you can access a lot more people
5384060	5386060	which is cool um IP
5386060	5388060	can be shared governance
5388060	5390060	is instead of just like a
5390060	5392060	the lab manager doing all the research
5392060	5394060	and directing things
5394060	5396060	uh everything can go up to a token vote
5396060	5398060	so if there's a question around
5398060	5400060	do experiment A or experiment B
5400060	5402060	um instead of just relying on one person
5402060	5404060	to do it you can you can issue
5404060	5406060	you can have like a vote on
5406060	5408060	uh snapshot and decide on what
5408060	5410060	does then use the collective intelligence to figure out
5410060	5412060	what the next step should be and then
5412060	5414060	the reproducible I think is one of the most important ones
5414060	5416060	like I think in a lot of research
5416060	5418060	today um
5418060	5420060	like most of the papers are not
5420060	5422060	reproducible because they're either too complex
5422060	5424060	they don't reveal enough about how their methodology
5424060	5426060	or uh it's
5426060	5428060	uh they p-value hack
5428060	5430060	and there's all sorts of issues but in d-side
5430060	5432060	all the because everything is
5432060	5434060	disintermediated between
5434060	5436060	physical entities everything is sort of logged
5436060	5438060	on chain so you can easily just like
5438060	5440060	replay back everything
5440060	5442060	and see which sort of science which
5442060	5444060	science is valid and which science is invalid
5444060	5446060	okay
5446060	5448060	um
5448060	5450060	so the way it works is like
5450060	5452060	if you want to create a d-side project
5452060	5454060	you first create you have an idea
5454060	5456060	and you say I want to create an idea around
5456060	5458060	sleep
5458060	5460060	and um everyone who contributes to that project
5460060	5462060	is issued a token
5462060	5464060	so maybe you contribute through
5464060	5466060	um giving sleep data
5466060	5468060	maybe you contribute through
5468060	5470060	uh doing an algorithm
5470060	5472060	uh developing some sort of algorithm
5472060	5474060	maybe you contribute through um recruiting
5474060	5476060	people and for each of these different
5476060	5478060	things you get tokens
5480060	5482060	um and these we have the
5482060	5484060	like data pools so people can sort of contribute
5484060	5486060	to a data pool
5486060	5488060	so if for example for sleep you can use
5488060	5490060	like the o-ring and contribute
5490060	5492060	to a data pool and that data pool
5492060	5494060	will then be accessible to anyone
5494060	5496060	who's interested in uh sleep
5498060	5500060	other types of data
5500060	5502060	pools that I think are really interesting are like
5502060	5504060	blueprint is very popular these days
5504060	5506060	so like longevity like how do
5506060	5508060	you determine if these types of things
5508060	5510060	these interventions work is you're going to need
5510060	5512060	like very very um like
5512060	5514060	broad data sets so
5514060	5516060	things around like spoo
5516060	5518060	um things around o-ring and things around
5518060	5520060	like genomic data are all
5520060	5522060	going to be really really interesting to determine
5522060	5524060	like uh these these are
5524060	5526060	these are prime data sets to figure out
5526060	5528060	like what's working and what's not working
5532060	5534060	um you can you can do a lot more with like
5534060	5536060	data quality so right now in a
5536060	5538060	research project um
5538060	5540060	people just sort of like put in things
5540060	5542060	like maybe the phd scene will like
5542060	5544060	look for outliers and remove those
5544060	5546060	and then sort of move on
5546060	5548060	but when you have like a decentralized
5548060	5550060	science system
5550060	5552060	people can like um stake
5552060	5554060	on data so when you submit
5554060	5556060	data to a research project
5556060	5558060	you can submit like uh
5558060	5560060	five dollars along with it
5560060	5562060	and why that's important is because if you then
5562060	5564060	if you contributed bad data
5564060	5566060	like you can get slashed so you'll
5566060	5568060	get your five dollars back so you sort of like
5568060	5570060	spam the system and then you
5570060	5572060	your data will be removed and so it's
5572060	5574060	incentivizing you to produce like
5574060	5576060	high quality data that can be verified
5576060	5578060	um and that's like these these are
5578060	5580060	the types of things that you can do
5580060	5582060	um with with like d-side but not with
5582060	5584060	like traditional science
5584060	5586060	um people can just like you could have
5586060	5588060	like a uh an exchange
5588060	5590060	sort of like coinbase you can
5590060	5592060	you can have like oh i want
5592060	5594060	to invest in or i want to invest but i want
5594060	5596060	to participate in um
5596060	5598060	like bitcoin or crypto
5598060	5600060	or like ethereum and similarly
5600060	5602060	it could be like oh i want to
5602060	5604060	participate in an hrv study
5604060	5606060	or a sleeve study or uh
5606060	5608060	a co2 study
5608060	5610060	so it sort of opens it up to
5610060	5612060	a lot more people um and then
5612060	5614060	this is one of the more interesting things you can
5614060	5616060	like instead of like how many
5616060	5618060	like how many people know what a prediction market is
5618060	5620060	okay so imagine
5620060	5622060	a prediction market it's just
5622060	5624060	like a it's like a betting market or
5624060	5626060	like you predict what's going to happen in the future
5626060	5628060	and if you're right you win tokens
5628060	5630060	and if you're wrong you lose tokens
5630060	5632060	and imagine like a prediction market
5632060	5634060	or like scientific experiments
5634060	5636060	so you're incentivized to um
5636060	5638060	think about like what types of experiments
5638060	5640060	are going to work and what type of experiments are not
5640060	5642060	going to work and this in this
5642060	5644060	like this is like this is very
5644060	5646060	different from peer review so peer review is like
5646060	5648060	i have no skin in the game i don't care if this paper's
5648060	5650060	been accepted or rejected now let's like flip that around
5650060	5652060	if i'm correct this paper is
5652060	5654060	correct i'm going to like earn tokens
5654060	5656060	now i'm like going to spend a little
5656060	5658060	more time reviewing it because it's like
5658060	5660060	you want to you want to do really good diligence on it
5660060	5662060	so
5662060	5664060	the upshot of this is like you're trying
5664060	5666060	to align incentives between like high quality
5666060	5668060	scientific research and
5668060	5670060	um like
5670060	5672060	the outcome for the individual
5672060	5674060	person
5674060	5676060	okay so basically like
5676060	5678060	we're trying to build a
5678060	5680060	platform that will like enable people
5680060	5682060	to participate in decentralized
5682060	5684060	project or to spin up one um we've started
5684060	5686060	it already it's called um water bear
5686060	5688060	got science and we're looking
5688060	5690060	where we're hiring so if people here
5690060	5692060	are interested in decentralized
5692060	5694060	science and um
5694060	5696060	um like
5696060	5698060	participants specific roles we need
5698060	5700060	are like we need like a bd and a community manager
5700060	5702060	person since it's a little we're
5702060	5704060	we're we're having like like a lot
5704060	5706060	of people inbound and uh we can't
5706060	5708060	really respond so we're trying to
5708060	5710060	grow uh we're
5710060	5712060	backed by uh like some
5712060	5714060	of the best investors in crypto so
5714060	5716060	if you're interested uh we're very
5716060	5718060	hiring here's our application
5718060	5720060	um it's very short uh we're in
5720060	5722060	person um we work
5722060	5724060	uh like normal hours
5724060	5726060	but it's all in person which i think is good
5726060	5728060	and uh i think this is like a great
5728060	5730060	community to pull from so if you enjoyed this
5730060	5732060	event and you want to participate more uh
5732060	5734060	definitely apply
5734060	5736060	and then
5736060	5738060	oh that's it
5738060	5740060	do you have any yeah do you have any questions
5740060	5742060	yeah
5742060	5744060	oh
5744060	5746060	uh dc.myc
5746060	5748060	yeah
5748060	5750060	uh so uh i have a question
5750060	5752060	so normally uh the government
5752060	5754060	uh so
5754060	5756060	some of the big resources of funding
5756060	5758060	for science and government comes from
5758060	5760060	uh dood defense
5760060	5762060	energy and medical
5762060	5764060	and uh a lot of times
5764060	5766060	they put the science right into
5766060	5768060	applications which generates
5768060	5770060	return for them uh what do you
5770060	5772060	see as the biggest uh the biggest
5772060	5774060	drivers for dc in terms of
5774060	5776060	funding
5776060	5778060	yeah i think there's a lot of people that are
5778060	5780060	just passionate about things like i would
5780060	5782060	fund uh michael levin research just because
5782060	5784060	i think it's cool like i would much rather give him money than
5784060	5786060	like some other like random
5786060	5788060	like charity
5788060	5790060	um so i think that's one i think people
5790060	5792060	that have a specific need for it some
5792060	5794060	like a rare disease like
5794060	5796060	people are much more interested in participating
5796060	5798060	in that sort of thing and if you give them
5798060	5800060	like a pathway to back
5800060	5802060	credible people and participate in that
5802060	5804060	type of research i think that's another one
5804060	5806060	um and and then people who are
5806060	5808060	just interested in science as well like
5808060	5810060	i think there's a lot of people that want to continue
5810060	5812060	education maybe have uh
5812060	5814060	knowledge and they enjoy doing it in that free time
5814060	5816060	that also i think the cost are decreasing so like
5816060	5818060	previously it used to be a lot harder
5818060	5820060	to do a science project but there's a lot
5820060	5822060	of like clinical research organizations
5822060	5824060	and a lot of automation and a lot of ai
5824060	5826060	that's happening that's i think bringing down some of the
5826060	5828060	costs associated with like traditional research
5830060	5832060	i mean i guess we'll make up a lot of
5832060	5834060	uh
5834060	5836060	uh yeah good um i guess
5836060	5838060	kind of like a follow-up but there's
5838060	5840060	usually a lot of ip coming out of research
5840060	5842060	to spin-offs and stuff
5842060	5844060	and so on um i
5844060	5846060	assume that that could be also framework where
5846060	5848060	incentives could be aligned
5848060	5850060	if you get part of that is that part of
5850060	5852060	the entire equation or yeah
5852060	5854060	so that's like
5854060	5856060	what's like how it works is you have an idea
5856060	5858060	around like let's just take an example
5858060	5860060	of
5860060	5862060	like mental health like so you create a mental
5862060	5864060	health now around a specific topic
5864060	5866060	and then everyone who participates it like that
5866060	5868060	sort of wraps that's the ip any ip
5868060	5870060	that's created as part of that group is tokenized
5870060	5872060	sort of and everyone who participates
5872060	5874060	and does work earns tokens
5874060	5876060	based on their participation so if you contribute data
5876060	5878060	if you contribute analysis
5878060	5880060	if you recruit patients if you publish it
5880060	5882060	you become you or you get these
5882060	5884060	tokens commiserate with your
5884060	5886060	how much you contributed
5886060	5888060	yeah and so that's
5888060	5890060	that's one of the things that's nice about d-size
5890060	5892060	like it solves the ip issue
5892060	5894060	so in like a in like a traditional
5894060	5896060	setting you'd work with the university's
5896060	5898060	tech transfer office and they take a third
5898060	5900060	and a third and a third and it becomes impossible
5900060	5902060	and a lot of people a lot of research dies there
5902060	5904060	for partially that reason but here it's much easier
5904060	5906060	like all the data is tokenized
5906060	5908060	and there's a lot of liquidity around it
5908060	5910060	so you can exit or
5910060	5912060	enter back in if you choose
5912060	5914060	you can also like
5914060	5916060	uh
5916060	5918060	invest some of the ip
5918060	5920060	so it keeps people invested in the project
5920060	5922060	like one of the projects one of the problems
5922060	5924060	now with like university
5924060	5926060	researchers people graduate and then they leave
5926060	5928060	but if they invest it over
5928060	5930060	maybe a longer investing period they might
5930060	5932060	want some advice to stick around
5932060	5934060	thanks Michael
5934060	5936060	you mentioned that if someone spams
5936060	5938060	the system with incorrect data that that could
5938060	5940060	be removed how would that happen
5940060	5942060	if it's on the blockchain
5942060	5944060	uh yeah it would just be marked
5944060	5946060	each um there's a couple different ways
5946060	5948060	of doing it one is to
5948060	5950060	allow any data and allow like some
5950060	5952060	agent to just
5952060	5954060	it finds on the research project the simplest thing is allow
5954060	5956060	all data and then use some sort of
5956060	5958060	ai or human to judge which is good
5958060	5960060	bad quality data um the second one
5960060	5962060	is to do like a community
5962060	5964060	voting so you have like a jury
5964060	5966060	and they vote on each piece of
5966060	5968060	data to see if it should be accepted or rejected
5968060	5970060	or maybe you could use something like a liquid
5970060	5972060	democracy approach where you can assign
5972060	5974060	your voting power to another
5974060	5976060	person and Dave can vote on your behalf
5976060	5978060	of if this data is good or not and you just
5978060	5980060	trust this person and then the
5980060	5982060	crypto economic way of doing it is to
5982060	5984060	um have people stake
5984060	5986060	money on their data so
5986060	5988060	when before you can contribute the data
5988060	5990060	to the data set you have to you contribute
5990060	5992060	it along with the five dollar bill
5992060	5994060	if your data is accepted by the community
5994060	5996060	you get your five dollars back you get
5996060	5998060	your data accepted into the community and your tokens
5998060	6000060	in return and whatever
6000060	6002060	benefits are associated with those tokens
6002060	6004060	but if your data is considered bad
6004060	6006060	by some standard then
6006060	6008060	the five dollars is removed
6008060	6010060	it's kept by the community
6010060	6012060	and um
6012060	6014060	the data is thrown away and
6014060	6016060	you might the next question you'd ask is like
6016060	6018060	um what prevents like
6018060	6020060	why would you contribute to what if there's a bad
6020060	6022060	community and uh
6022060	6024060	they just kept all the money associated with the data
6024060	6026060	that's come in and the answer to that is
6026060	6028060	like um all
6028060	6030060	transactions that have been submitted to the
6030060	6032060	DAO for to
6032060	6034060	accept the data are on chain so you could
6034060	6036060	review the previous connected to the previous
6036060	6038060	submissions and say like
6038060	6040060	they've submitted a hundred people
6040060	6042060	have submitted great quality data and it's all been
6042060	6044060	rejected this DAO is
6044060	6046060	um is
6046060	6048060	terrible I'm not going to participate in it
6052060	6054060	anybody else
6054060	6056060	cool
6056060	6058060	well um
6058060	6060060	thank you all for coming it's amazing
6060060	6062060	to see all you here
6062060	6064060	and uh I'd like to see you
6064060	6066060	on August 1st
6066060	6068060	we might do one in between and we haven't scheduled it yet
6068060	6070060	but the August 1st one is the next one
6070060	6072060	and if you're interested in decentralized science
6072060	6074060	or you know someone that is share with a friend
6074060	6076060	and uh recommend them
6076060	6078060	alright thank you guys
6078060	6080060	applause
