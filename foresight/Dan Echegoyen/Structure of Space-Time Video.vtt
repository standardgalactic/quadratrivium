00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
A visually intuitive model illustrating the connection between gravity, black holes, accelerating

00:11.000 --> 00:16.520
expansion of the universe, and inertia, all in six minutes.

00:16.520 --> 00:22.000
Our universe is described as a local density fluctuation, a wave pulse.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.880
The universe, and everything in it, exists at least in part as waves that interfere or

00:26.880 --> 00:32.080
resonate with themselves and all other things, which are also waves.

00:32.080 --> 00:36.760
Existence is interference patterns interfering with other interference patterns.

00:36.760 --> 00:42.000
This process makes up the world in the finest detail and the grandest scale.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.160
At the bottom of this majestic creation are the three fundamental waveforms that exist

00:47.160 --> 00:50.080
before any interference.

00:50.080 --> 00:53.480
The three waveforms actually are three different shapes.

00:53.480 --> 00:58.040
The shape depends on the speed of the wave relative to the speed of the source of that

00:58.040 --> 00:59.040
wave.

00:59.040 --> 01:03.200
These waves exist in two and three dimensions, at least.

01:03.200 --> 01:08.800
When a source is still relative to the wave that it makes, you get a circle or a sphere.

01:08.800 --> 01:13.800
When the source is faster than the wave it makes, you get the v-wake of a speedboat or

01:13.800 --> 01:17.280
the sonic boom cone of a jet aircraft.

01:17.280 --> 01:22.080
When the source and wave both move at the same speed, you get, perhaps less visually

01:22.080 --> 01:27.760
intuitively, a propagating torus in three dimensions or twin vortices for an ore stroke

01:27.760 --> 01:29.720
in two dimensions.

01:29.720 --> 01:35.440
All three waveforms hold their shape as they propagate and have no limits to their scales.

01:35.440 --> 01:40.040
While spherical and conic waveforms can be continuous, expanding as they pass through

01:40.040 --> 01:45.680
space and time and crossing all observers, the propagating torus exists in discrete units

01:45.680 --> 01:49.080
and moves in one direction without expanding.

01:49.080 --> 01:54.400
Any resident wave path around the torus will create a torus an exact number of times, both

01:54.400 --> 01:58.360
linearly and laterally, a rational slope.

01:58.360 --> 02:01.880
The field is quantized in both directions.

02:01.880 --> 02:05.560
Such unit spin particles are bosons of exchange.

02:05.560 --> 02:11.400
The chorus is the waveform of exchange from photons to neural impulses to hurricanes and

02:11.400 --> 02:12.400
tornadoes.

02:12.400 --> 02:18.920
A wave pulse, like our universe, is a place of constant change, an oxymoron.

02:18.920 --> 02:24.040
During propagation, the mass particles and energy waves continue to change to stay the

02:24.040 --> 02:25.200
same.

02:25.200 --> 02:30.360
The relationships within entities and between entities change in and with the field of space

02:30.360 --> 02:32.120
time.

02:32.120 --> 02:37.320
The wave shapes of the sphere cone and torus each maintains a different enfoldment of wave

02:37.320 --> 02:42.840
space, yet each is clearly a dynamic surface, a wave pulse, that has its own relationship

02:42.840 --> 02:47.440
of masses and energies in its particular field of space and time.

02:47.440 --> 02:51.360
Each waveform is its own kind of universe.

02:51.360 --> 02:57.540
Consider a propagating torus as a two-dimensional universe, one of space and one of time.

02:57.540 --> 03:01.560
Our universe is not as simple as a torus, but Einstein's equations are topological

03:01.560 --> 03:06.920
and dynamic and a single torus model allows for a simplified version of space and time

03:06.920 --> 03:09.120
to demonstrate concepts on.

03:09.120 --> 03:11.600
The axes of space and time are different.

03:11.600 --> 03:15.320
In the space axis, motion is in either of two directions.

03:15.320 --> 03:20.080
From the time axis, motion tends to oppose the direction of propagation, classically

03:20.080 --> 03:21.400
in one direction.

03:21.400 --> 03:27.400
In fact, the torus, with its wave and source both moving at the same speed, has its resonant

03:27.400 --> 03:32.480
entities remaining laterally still as time moves through them.

03:32.480 --> 03:38.720
Resonant energies swim upstream, in time, to hold still in the here and now.

03:38.720 --> 03:42.880
The rubber sheet model of gravity shows how space is distorted by mass in that field of

03:42.880 --> 03:44.440
space time.

03:44.440 --> 03:49.640
The distortion is due to acceleration of the mass, or energy, perpendicular to the plane,

03:49.640 --> 03:51.840
in this case by gravity.

03:51.840 --> 03:56.400
Einstein said gravity is indistinguishable from acceleration.

03:56.400 --> 04:01.880
Just as there is angular momentum and linear momentum, there is also angular acceleration

04:01.880 --> 04:04.280
and linear acceleration.

04:04.280 --> 04:08.840
While a propagating torus moves in a straight line, all the points on the surface of the

04:08.840 --> 04:14.360
torus move in circles and experience angular acceleration.

04:14.360 --> 04:20.320
The tension field that separates the inside of the torus from the outside experiences

04:20.320 --> 04:25.440
angular acceleration and can be deformed by the masses and energies of the propagating

04:25.440 --> 04:29.120
torus, just like the rubber sheet experiencing gravity.

04:29.120 --> 04:34.380
If you blow a big slow smoke ring into a room with very still air, as it propagates and

04:34.380 --> 04:40.160
slows even more, the smoke ring will eventually produce a bulge of mass energy moving around

04:40.160 --> 04:43.120
on the propagating surface of the smoke ring.

04:43.120 --> 04:48.640
The bulge is a gravitational depression that will attract additional mass and energy.

04:48.640 --> 04:53.880
Eventually, the bulge gathers enough mass and energy to collapse the field and emit

04:53.880 --> 04:58.680
a new smaller torus with the time and space axes reversed.

04:58.680 --> 05:03.160
It is a black hole in the field, inside the new torus.

05:03.160 --> 05:07.120
Motion through space is restricted, just like our motion through time.

05:07.120 --> 05:10.480
But in a black hole, motion through time is allowed.

05:10.480 --> 05:16.120
Big picture, concepts like time and space may be too concrete and might more generally

05:16.120 --> 05:18.760
be called linear and lateral.

05:18.760 --> 05:24.600
The energy of propagation is causing our current accelerating expansion and will cause the

05:24.600 --> 05:26.760
eventual contraction as well.

05:26.760 --> 05:33.000
Globally, the inertia of the propagating field is the dark energy of the universe.

05:33.000 --> 05:40.600
Locally, the inertia of mass and energy collapses the propagating field into a new torus, while

05:40.600 --> 05:44.000
switching what is linear and lateral.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.040
Global inertia drives space-time.

05:47.040 --> 05:50.560
Local inertia collapses space-time.

05:50.560 --> 05:55.040
By me, Dan Atchagoyan, from my video, the Structure of Existence video on YouTube, it's over

05:55.040 --> 05:56.040
an hour long.

05:56.040 --> 06:01.920
I have many new ideas and lots of insights, and I hope you watch it in order.

06:01.920 --> 06:02.720
Thank you so much.
