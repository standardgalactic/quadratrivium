ðŸ”¹ **Gravity and Black Holes:** Gravity is a manifestation of curvature in space-time caused by mass and energy. A propagating torus model can help visualize this, where the distortion of space due to mass is analogous to the way a smoke ring distorts the air it moves through. In the context of black holes, as a slow-moving smoke ring gathers mass, it collapses under its own gravity, potentially forming a black hole.

ðŸ”¹ **Accelerating Expansion of the Universe:** The universe is expanding at an accelerating rate, which can be understood as the inertia of the propagating field of space-time on a cosmic scale. This global inertia drives the expansion and is often referred to as dark energy.

ðŸ”¹ **Inertia:** Inertia is the tendency of an object to resist changes in its state of motion or rest. Locally, inertia can be seen in the way mass and energy within the propagating torus model collapse the field into a new configuration, effectively reversing what is considered linear and lateral.

ðŸ”¹ **Waveforms:** There are three fundamental waveforms that exist before any interference: the sphere (representing a source at rest relative to the wave), the cone (representing a superluminal source), and the propagating torus (representing a source moving at the speed of the wave). These waves maintain their shape as they propagate and can be visualized in two or three dimensions.

ðŸ”¹ **Quantization:** The propagating torus model suggests that space and time are quantized, with entities existing in discrete units that move in one direction without expanding. This concept of quantization is similar to the behavior of bosons, which are particles that facilitate forces between other particles.

ðŸ”¹ **Exchange Forces:** All types of exchange forces, from photons to neural impulses to weather systems, can be understood as waves that propagate in a manner analogous to the propagating torus model.

ðŸ”¹ **Wave Pulse Universe:** The universe is described as a local density fluctuation, a wave pulse that is constantly changing yet maintaining relationships within and between entities. This model offers a way to visualize complex concepts such as the relationship between gravity, black holes, accelerating expansion, and inertia.

ðŸ”¹ **Dan Atchagoyan's Model:** The above explanation is a summary of the ideas presented by Dan Atchagoyan in his video "The Structure of Existence," which aims to provide a cohesive understanding of the fundamental aspects of our universe through the lens of wave dynamics and space-time curvature.

In essence, Atchagoyan's model proposes that the universe can be visualized as a propagating torus, where gravitational effects, expansion, and inertia are all manifestations of wave interactions and the properties of space-time. This model attempts to unify various aspects of physics into a more intuitive, albeit abstract, framework.
