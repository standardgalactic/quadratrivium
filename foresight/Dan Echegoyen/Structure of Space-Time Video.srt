00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
A visually intuitive model illustrating the connection between gravity, black holes, accelerating

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,520
expansion of the universe, and inertia, all in six minutes.

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:22,000
Our universe is described as a local density fluctuation, a wave pulse.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,880
The universe, and everything in it, exists at least in part as waves that interfere or

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,080
resonate with themselves and all other things, which are also waves.

6
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,760
Existence is interference patterns interfering with other interference patterns.

7
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:42,000
This process makes up the world in the finest detail and the grandest scale.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,160
At the bottom of this majestic creation are the three fundamental waveforms that exist

9
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,080
before any interference.

10
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,480
The three waveforms actually are three different shapes.

11
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:58,040
The shape depends on the speed of the wave relative to the speed of the source of that

12
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,040
wave.

13
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,200
These waves exist in two and three dimensions, at least.

14
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,800
When a source is still relative to the wave that it makes, you get a circle or a sphere.

15
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,800
When the source is faster than the wave it makes, you get the v-wake of a speedboat or

16
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,280
the sonic boom cone of a jet aircraft.

17
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,080
When the source and wave both move at the same speed, you get, perhaps less visually

18
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,760
intuitively, a propagating torus in three dimensions or twin vortices for an ore stroke

19
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,720
in two dimensions.

20
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:35,440
All three waveforms hold their shape as they propagate and have no limits to their scales.

21
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:40,040
While spherical and conic waveforms can be continuous, expanding as they pass through

22
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,680
space and time and crossing all observers, the propagating torus exists in discrete units

23
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,080
and moves in one direction without expanding.

24
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:54,400
Any resident wave path around the torus will create a torus an exact number of times, both

25
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,360
linearly and laterally, a rational slope.

26
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,880
The field is quantized in both directions.

27
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,560
Such unit spin particles are bosons of exchange.

28
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:11,400
The chorus is the waveform of exchange from photons to neural impulses to hurricanes and

29
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,400
tornadoes.

30
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,920
A wave pulse, like our universe, is a place of constant change, an oxymoron.

31
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,040
During propagation, the mass particles and energy waves continue to change to stay the

32
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,200
same.

33
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,360
The relationships within entities and between entities change in and with the field of space

34
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,120
time.

35
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,320
The wave shapes of the sphere cone and torus each maintains a different enfoldment of wave

36
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:42,840
space, yet each is clearly a dynamic surface, a wave pulse, that has its own relationship

37
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,440
of masses and energies in its particular field of space and time.

38
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,360
Each waveform is its own kind of universe.

39
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:57,540
Consider a propagating torus as a two-dimensional universe, one of space and one of time.

40
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,560
Our universe is not as simple as a torus, but Einstein's equations are topological

41
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,920
and dynamic and a single torus model allows for a simplified version of space and time

42
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,120
to demonstrate concepts on.

43
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,600
The axes of space and time are different.

44
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,320
In the space axis, motion is in either of two directions.

45
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:20,080
From the time axis, motion tends to oppose the direction of propagation, classically

46
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,400
in one direction.

47
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:27,400
In fact, the torus, with its wave and source both moving at the same speed, has its resonant

48
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,480
entities remaining laterally still as time moves through them.

49
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:38,720
Resonant energies swim upstream, in time, to hold still in the here and now.

50
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,880
The rubber sheet model of gravity shows how space is distorted by mass in that field of

51
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,440
space time.

52
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,640
The distortion is due to acceleration of the mass, or energy, perpendicular to the plane,

53
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,840
in this case by gravity.

54
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,400
Einstein said gravity is indistinguishable from acceleration.

55
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,880
Just as there is angular momentum and linear momentum, there is also angular acceleration

56
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,280
and linear acceleration.

57
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,840
While a propagating torus moves in a straight line, all the points on the surface of the

58
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:14,360
torus move in circles and experience angular acceleration.

59
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:20,320
The tension field that separates the inside of the torus from the outside experiences

60
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,440
angular acceleration and can be deformed by the masses and energies of the propagating

61
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,120
torus, just like the rubber sheet experiencing gravity.

62
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,380
If you blow a big slow smoke ring into a room with very still air, as it propagates and

63
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:40,160
slows even more, the smoke ring will eventually produce a bulge of mass energy moving around

64
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,120
on the propagating surface of the smoke ring.

65
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,640
The bulge is a gravitational depression that will attract additional mass and energy.

66
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:53,880
Eventually, the bulge gathers enough mass and energy to collapse the field and emit

67
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:58,680
a new smaller torus with the time and space axes reversed.

68
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,160
It is a black hole in the field, inside the new torus.

69
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,120
Motion through space is restricted, just like our motion through time.

70
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,480
But in a black hole, motion through time is allowed.

71
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:16,120
Big picture, concepts like time and space may be too concrete and might more generally

72
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,760
be called linear and lateral.

73
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:24,600
The energy of propagation is causing our current accelerating expansion and will cause the

74
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,760
eventual contraction as well.

75
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:33,000
Globally, the inertia of the propagating field is the dark energy of the universe.

76
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,600
Locally, the inertia of mass and energy collapses the propagating field into a new torus, while

77
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,000
switching what is linear and lateral.

78
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,040
Global inertia drives space-time.

79
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,560
Local inertia collapses space-time.

80
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,040
By me, Dan Atchagoyan, from my video, the Structure of Existence video on YouTube, it's over

81
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,040
an hour long.

82
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:01,920
I have many new ideas and lots of insights, and I hope you watch it in order.

83
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,720
Thank you so much.
