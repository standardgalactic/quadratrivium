0	11000	A visually intuitive model illustrating the connection between gravity, black holes, accelerating
11000	16520	expansion of the universe, and inertia, all in six minutes.
16520	22000	Our universe is described as a local density fluctuation, a wave pulse.
22000	26880	The universe, and everything in it, exists at least in part as waves that interfere or
26880	32080	resonate with themselves and all other things, which are also waves.
32080	36760	Existence is interference patterns interfering with other interference patterns.
36760	42000	This process makes up the world in the finest detail and the grandest scale.
42000	47160	At the bottom of this majestic creation are the three fundamental waveforms that exist
47160	50080	before any interference.
50080	53480	The three waveforms actually are three different shapes.
53480	58040	The shape depends on the speed of the wave relative to the speed of the source of that
58040	59040	wave.
59040	63200	These waves exist in two and three dimensions, at least.
63200	68800	When a source is still relative to the wave that it makes, you get a circle or a sphere.
68800	73800	When the source is faster than the wave it makes, you get the v-wake of a speedboat or
73800	77280	the sonic boom cone of a jet aircraft.
77280	82080	When the source and wave both move at the same speed, you get, perhaps less visually
82080	87760	intuitively, a propagating torus in three dimensions or twin vortices for an ore stroke
87760	89720	in two dimensions.
89720	95440	All three waveforms hold their shape as they propagate and have no limits to their scales.
95440	100040	While spherical and conic waveforms can be continuous, expanding as they pass through
100040	105680	space and time and crossing all observers, the propagating torus exists in discrete units
105680	109080	and moves in one direction without expanding.
109080	114400	Any resident wave path around the torus will create a torus an exact number of times, both
114400	118360	linearly and laterally, a rational slope.
118360	121880	The field is quantized in both directions.
121880	125560	Such unit spin particles are bosons of exchange.
125560	131400	The chorus is the waveform of exchange from photons to neural impulses to hurricanes and
131400	132400	tornadoes.
132400	138920	A wave pulse, like our universe, is a place of constant change, an oxymoron.
138920	144040	During propagation, the mass particles and energy waves continue to change to stay the
144040	145200	same.
145200	150360	The relationships within entities and between entities change in and with the field of space
150360	152120	time.
152120	157320	The wave shapes of the sphere cone and torus each maintains a different enfoldment of wave
157320	162840	space, yet each is clearly a dynamic surface, a wave pulse, that has its own relationship
162840	167440	of masses and energies in its particular field of space and time.
167440	171360	Each waveform is its own kind of universe.
171360	177540	Consider a propagating torus as a two-dimensional universe, one of space and one of time.
177540	181560	Our universe is not as simple as a torus, but Einstein's equations are topological
181560	186920	and dynamic and a single torus model allows for a simplified version of space and time
186920	189120	to demonstrate concepts on.
189120	191600	The axes of space and time are different.
191600	195320	In the space axis, motion is in either of two directions.
195320	200080	From the time axis, motion tends to oppose the direction of propagation, classically
200080	201400	in one direction.
201400	207400	In fact, the torus, with its wave and source both moving at the same speed, has its resonant
207400	212480	entities remaining laterally still as time moves through them.
212480	218720	Resonant energies swim upstream, in time, to hold still in the here and now.
218720	222880	The rubber sheet model of gravity shows how space is distorted by mass in that field of
222880	224440	space time.
224440	229640	The distortion is due to acceleration of the mass, or energy, perpendicular to the plane,
229640	231840	in this case by gravity.
231840	236400	Einstein said gravity is indistinguishable from acceleration.
236400	241880	Just as there is angular momentum and linear momentum, there is also angular acceleration
241880	244280	and linear acceleration.
244280	248840	While a propagating torus moves in a straight line, all the points on the surface of the
248840	254360	torus move in circles and experience angular acceleration.
254360	260320	The tension field that separates the inside of the torus from the outside experiences
260320	265440	angular acceleration and can be deformed by the masses and energies of the propagating
265440	269120	torus, just like the rubber sheet experiencing gravity.
269120	274380	If you blow a big slow smoke ring into a room with very still air, as it propagates and
274380	280160	slows even more, the smoke ring will eventually produce a bulge of mass energy moving around
280160	283120	on the propagating surface of the smoke ring.
283120	288640	The bulge is a gravitational depression that will attract additional mass and energy.
288640	293880	Eventually, the bulge gathers enough mass and energy to collapse the field and emit
293880	298680	a new smaller torus with the time and space axes reversed.
298680	303160	It is a black hole in the field, inside the new torus.
303160	307120	Motion through space is restricted, just like our motion through time.
307120	310480	But in a black hole, motion through time is allowed.
310480	316120	Big picture, concepts like time and space may be too concrete and might more generally
316120	318760	be called linear and lateral.
318760	324600	The energy of propagation is causing our current accelerating expansion and will cause the
324600	326760	eventual contraction as well.
326760	333000	Globally, the inertia of the propagating field is the dark energy of the universe.
333000	340600	Locally, the inertia of mass and energy collapses the propagating field into a new torus, while
340600	344000	switching what is linear and lateral.
344000	347040	Global inertia drives space-time.
347040	350560	Local inertia collapses space-time.
350560	355040	By me, Dan Atchagoyan, from my video, the Structure of Existence video on YouTube, it's over
355040	356040	an hour long.
356040	361920	I have many new ideas and lots of insights, and I hope you watch it in order.
361920	362720	Thank you so much.
