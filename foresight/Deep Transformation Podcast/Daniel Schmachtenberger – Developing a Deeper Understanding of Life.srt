00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Welcome to Deep Transformation, Self-Society Spirit.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,600
I'm Roger Walsh, and our co-host is John DePuy.

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,160
And with us today is a guest that I'm just delighted to be in dialogue with.

4
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:29,960
This is Daniel Schmacktenberger, one of the most incisive, integrative, and brilliant

5
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,880
thinkers about the great issues of our time.

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,560
Daniel's a polymath who has ranged across a wide variety of disciplines and has a prodigious

7
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:47,360
amount of information about multiple areas, topics, issues, concerns, and intellectual

8
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:54,440
disciplines, but not only a wide array of information, a remarkable degree of information

9
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:00,840
and integration, pulling topics together, synthesizing them in novel ways, and coming

10
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:07,760
up with creative innovations and ideas and synthesis.

11
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:15,640
He is able to and has been giving us a wide array of insights into the great issues of

12
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,640
our time.

13
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,120
And if you've searched the internet, you've probably run across Daniel and the many dialogues

14
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:28,160
he's had about the metacrisis, the term that's currently used for some total of our social

15
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,520
and global issues.

16
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:38,240
But what you haven't seen or heard of, Daniel, is his spiritual dimensions and the ways in

17
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:44,840
which those have touched his understanding of life and our current temporary concerns.

18
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:50,600
So we were really delighted, given that Deep Transformation is about transformation not

19
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,840
only of self and society, but also of spirit, when Daniel suggested that in our discussion

20
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,480
of the metacrisis, we focused specifically on the spiritual dimensions, which he said

21
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,120
he doesn't often get a chance to talk about.

22
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,720
And so we are just very happy to have this opportunity.

23
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:15,200
Daniel, so many people know you as someone, as a brilliant intellectual who has thought

24
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:22,280
deep and hard and synthetically and novelly about these great issues.

25
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,320
But you also have a deep commitment to self exploration, self actualization, spiritual

26
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,520
practice.

27
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:36,480
What would you like to share about that side of yourself?

28
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:47,240
First, thanks for having me here, it's good to be with you both and all the people engaging

29
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,200
in the podcast.

30
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:59,040
When it comes to the spiritual dimensions, and we'll probably want to unpack what we

31
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:05,440
even mean by spiritual sense, it is a pretty unprecise term often.

32
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:16,880
But the psychological, interior, sacred, whatever dimensions of the state of our world, I would

33
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,880
love to be in that conversation together.

34
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,080
I don't have a preset set of things to talk about on it, because as you mentioned, it's

35
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:33,680
not the thing I talk about all the time, but obviously very interesting.

36
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,600
I was fortunate in my growing up to get to study a lot of the people that might be called

37
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:44,480
great polymaths throughout history, so I have a heap of respect for them and I've tried

38
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:51,600
to learn what I can, I would not describe myself that way.

39
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:57,440
I think the connection is I would describe myself as being deeply interested in lots of

40
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:06,200
things, and I find that what people are interested in and what they find meaningful, and at the

41
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,800
heart of that what they find sacred are usually connected, though they might not be explicitly

42
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:16,520
aware, and the things that people are interested in and enough, they often develop some capacity

43
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:28,200
at, and if someone has some sense of the wholeness of reality, as opposed to when we think in

44
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:37,080
different disciplines, here's where biology starts and chemistry stops or physics or whatever,

45
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,640
those are ways we take the complexity of the world and try to divide it to make subjects

46
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:45,800
and make it easier to study, but those divisions don't exist in reality in that way.

47
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:52,720
So if we have some sense of just the integrated wholeness of reality and we're kind of interested in it,

48
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,720
there's some sense that reality itself is sacred, then there would be nothing that isn't interesting.

49
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:06,720
It's like, if you're really in love with your partner, what aspect of their being is uninteresting to you?

50
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,640
It's a weird proposition to say, oh, I don't give a shit what she thinks about, or her

51
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:17,960
talk books on fashion or whatever it is, and it's such a superficial place to be, because even if you

52
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,520
didn't think you cared about that topic on your own, if you really care about this being and this

53
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,920
being cares about it, work to understand why they care about it, because there's some part of their

54
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:32,840
being you're missing, if the fascination they have, if the care, if the love doesn't translate to,

55
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:40,760
and so if you get that, you're like, well, whatever, every aspect of them I'm interested in,

56
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:45,000
because part of love is the desire to know, because what does it mean that I love somebody if I don't

57
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:53,880
really know who they are? And if I have some love for reality, then wanting to know it more is

58
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,680
one of the things, right, wanting to appreciate it more wanting to be in more service to it,

59
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:05,720
and those are all just kind of natural byproducts. And so relatively young,

60
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:15,000
I had the insight that everything was interesting, that the things that I thought weren't interesting,

61
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,400
because at first I didn't think that, but the things I thought weren't interesting was just

62
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:27,000
because I didn't get them, I didn't understand why anyone else found it interesting, and if I

63
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,280
tuned in empathetically enough to them, and I could see it, I'm like, oh, there's a whole

64
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,840
dimension of meaningfulness and beauty and parts of the nature of reality that I'm just missing,

65
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:44,920
and when Gibran said it's in, it was in meditation upon the dew drop that I discovered the mysteries

66
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:50,520
of the ocean, right, the kind of poetic way to speak to the fractal nature or the as without so

67
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:57,160
within, when there is some understanding of the integratedness of reality, a deep insight about

68
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:03,240
anything also gives you some insight about everything else. And one of the places that I

69
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:09,640
most insight was taking some principle in thermodynamics and applying it to gardening,

70
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:14,680
or some principle in evolutionary theory and applying it to relationships or whatever,

71
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,720
getting that like those theories were ways of understanding the universe, but all of them

72
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,720
gave different insights, looking at the world through a thermodynamics lens versus an evolutionary

73
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,520
psych lens versus a complexity theory lens gave different insights on the same reality.

74
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,840
So if I could take those insights and apply them to lots of things and apply lots of different

75
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:37,560
ones, just got to see more multi-dimensionally. I mean, one of the projects we launched called

76
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,320
the conciliance project, and that's what the word conciliance means is the more

77
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:47,560
perspectives one can take on the thing, the more depth and richness of information they can get

78
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:55,240
about it. So, and I think, you know, the the metacrisis, this area of study of like,

79
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:02,120
what are all the problems of the world is really like came from a childhood inquiry of

80
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:10,360
what is worth doing. And there were so many things that were worth doing. And I became

81
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:17,080
kind of clear that when you focus on one, one, I just couldn't leave some of the areas out,

82
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:23,320
right? Like, it was just, I don't know how many people have this experience, some for sure.

83
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,200
But when I would think about really focusing on factory farms or really focusing on

84
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:35,080
the issue of how many dogs and cats are getting put to sleep every year or clear cutting or whatever

85
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:42,200
it was, the idea that I was not focusing on the other things just wrecked me. And then getting

86
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,680
to see that there were so many groups focusing on those things, and yet so many of those things

87
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,760
collectively were getting worse, not better. And I was wondering, do we just need more effort in

88
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,800
these areas? Or is there something about the nature of the effort that is that is off?

89
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,160
And the answer is both. But there was definitely something about, and people have heard me talk

90
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,640
other places, the way we solve problems causes other problems almost all the time, because we

91
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,960
define the problem too narrowly, we create a first order solution that the technology or a law or

92
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:14,920
business or whatever to solve it. But that's connected to a complex set of things, and it

93
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:19,800
produces second and third order effects somewhere else. So the dam to bring electricity to poor

94
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,120
people to solve the poverty issue might extinct a bunch of species downriver from the dam that

95
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:33,000
just got flooded or whatever in this, a million examples of this. So there's a, it actually became

96
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:40,280
clear that the study of the issues in the world and the siloing of the issues in the world was

97
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:45,240
a part of the problem itself, why we weren't solving them in a way that Bohm talked about very

98
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:53,880
well, David Bohm. And so the, like what is worth caring about everything, you know, how it fits

99
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,680
together, what is worth studying is kind of everything. The study is for itself, it's pure

100
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,400
knowledge of just the intimacy with universes intrinsically interesting. And it's also has

101
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:10,200
utility, it can increase the capacity to be of service to. Those are some initial thoughts.

102
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:17,960
And Daniel, did you, was there a point as a young man or a teenager, you began as you were

103
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,640
kind of chewing on all this and seeing it was that starting to emerge as a calling

104
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:28,760
for you that maybe that was your path to start connecting the dots and seeing how these things

105
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,200
mattered? I think

106
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:45,880
I think most people when they're young are enculturated in a particular way about who they are

107
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:51,640
and what life is about and what they should pursue. And then some of them continue on that path,

108
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:57,320
some of them recognize that their parents idea of what they're calling should be or their culture's

109
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:08,120
idea is not their own and then they have kind of this path change. I've had lots of path

110
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:19,480
refinements. I have had times of deep study in esoteric metaphysics and hardcore reductionist

111
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:24,120
atheism, you know, like any young person who's trying to be intellectually congruent and make

112
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:30,040
sense of stuff and not miss stuff. But they had the same spirit to them, which is funny, right?

113
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,040
They had the same spirit, which was like, and you can't even put words to it because you can

114
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:38,200
say it's what is true, but it's also kind of what is good, what is meaningful, what is beautiful,

115
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:48,120
and you know, something like that. But I think I was pretty fortunate in a way that some other,

116
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,920
but not lots of other people were in terms of early childhood exposure to the topic of what is my

117
00:11:52,920 --> 00:12:00,920
path is that I had parents that were putting that question as the forefront of my education

118
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:09,480
since I was born. And so that's a pretty fortunate thing. And I went to school a few times mostly

119
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:14,680
my parents were interested in me getting some socialization, but I was mostly home school.

120
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:22,120
And they were interested in running a kind of educational experiment. And they were not

121
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,440
educational philosophers in any formally trained sense, they hadn't read Dewey and Montessori and

122
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,960
Steiner, they just had their own kind of intuitions about it. But some really good intuitions.

123
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:37,880
But the sense was rather than have a curriculum based thing have some sense of trust that the

124
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,920
kids innate curiosities if facilitated will orient them in the right direction. So it's kind

125
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:51,800
of constructivist. And so we had a homeschool that had no curriculum at all. And there are a few

126
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:57,560
places where this was significantly disadvantageous because like it wasn't till I was an adult and

127
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:03,320
paying attention to spell checker that I learned how to spell. It's very fortunate. I didn't do enough

128
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:08,840
of the like writing letters penmanship to actually have refined the fine motor skills enough to have

129
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:14,120
legible handwriting. I didn't get it and then let it devolve because of busyness like some doctors,

130
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:20,840
I just never even got decent penmanship. It was a good thing I can type. There were whole areas of

131
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,240
like American history and things that were actually important that I just didn't know were

132
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,160
important and I just had none of them. But then there were some areas that I got to study way

133
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,320
more deeply than people normally would have at those times. But because I was studying things

134
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:38,200
I was interested in, I doubled down on interest, right? And I think one of the things that happens

135
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:43,160
for a kid is when you don't facilitate their interests because you don't know how, which

136
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:48,600
so often the kids are asking questions and the parents just don't know the answers. I give these

137
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:55,320
examples a lot because they come up all the time when a kid asks why is the sky blue or why is fire

138
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:02,920
hot. You have to understand many layers of physics but then also neuroscience and then also the

139
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:08,840
philosophy of mind to be able to translate the subjective experience of hotness from sensations

140
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:15,160
that happen on the skin and what is communicated between cells and in the nervous system to what

141
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:20,520
is the thermodynamics of fire or the nature of the molecules in the upper atmosphere that create

142
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:27,000
blueness in the visual optical spectrum. Those questions, if every kid asks stuff like that

143
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,440
and if you know how to facilitate the interest, they end up learning everything from theory of

144
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:39,400
mind to philosophy of science to, you know, atmospherics and neurobiology. But if you don't

145
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:44,040
facilitate the things they're interested in and you force them to do shit that they're not interested

146
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:49,320
in, it can break their interest and then they become a little bit more focused on quick hits of

147
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:58,360
dopaminergic interest rather than deep learning. So I had that fortune but the other fortune other

148
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,960
than just kind of just hiding my own curriculum is because a kid will largely be interested in

149
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:06,600
things based on what they're exposed to and how they're exposed. I don't find that there are any

150
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,880
kids who aren't interested in math who had amazing math teachers or who weren't interested in art who

151
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,800
had amazing art teachers or history. So how they're exposed, what they're exposed to. And so

152
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,600
what my parents were interested in had a lot to do with what I was interested in, of course,

153
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,000
right? This is one of the limits of constructivism is, you know, what the reality of what the

154
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,520
kid is exposed to. But again, I feel like I lucked out in terms of their interest being things were

155
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:37,160
a pretty good set of things. So my, my parents were reading Buckminster Fuller and kind of design

156
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:42,360
science and they were reading David Bowman, Krishnamurti, they were reading kind of Vedanta

157
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:47,480
and Eastern philosophy for Choff Capra and the kind of emerging systems theory in the early 80s and

158
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:54,360
and they also the thought that there's no reason bedtime kids bedtime stories for kids when their

159
00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:00,040
infants need to be Dr. Seuss as opposed to synergetics by Bucking Fuller because kids learning

160
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:07,080
language no matter what. And so those were like my primitive concepts and included in those were

161
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:12,920
the core existential questions of what are we, what are we here for? What is this all about?

162
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:17,880
And then the people using kind of the most advanced frameworks of the time like systems theory and

163
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:23,480
design science to think about how do we go about making a better world and like that. So I never

164
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:31,720
really had to find my way to that. That was kind of the default setting. I had to find and upon

165
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,760
further inquiry of like, was that a wrong default setting? Should I just

166
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:42,360
just make money or make art or something else? Like no, that didn't, that ended up continuing to be

167
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:51,960
roughly right direction, but trying to more competently answer how to understand the issues

168
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,240
of the world and how to be of service to them. It's a lot of content refinement.

169
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:05,400
Daniel, so you had an unusually broad self-directed education, but there's also

170
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:11,480
something else that's quite distinctive about your thinking and that is a rare degree of integration.

171
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,600
And how did you develop that?

172
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:26,680
I have friends who are developmental theorists who, Zach Stein, who I work with closely and

173
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:32,680
many others, who will talk about how there is an increase in the type of

174
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:41,160
complexity of what someone can process, the way they notice changes in context for processing

175
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,560
the same content the way they can seek and shift perspectives and then integrate them. And I think

176
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:50,120
there's a lot true and important there. I have other friends who are critics of developmental

177
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:56,440
theory because they say there's a lot of societal normative assumptions based on how people are

178
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,440
kind of ubiquitously trained that in a different society with different childhood development

179
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:11,720
would go differently. So for instance, if kids are being taught in school, this is math, this is

180
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:16,600
social studies, this is history, this is biology, and they're being taught a compartmentalized

181
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,840
universe where they're never asked how the social science is being influenced by the biology or

182
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:26,280
vice versa or how the principles co-apply, they're getting a non-integrated fragmented world

183
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:31,480
given to them and actually behaviorally trained up on thinking that way. They're not being given

184
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,560
any kind of integrated framework, so then we get excited when someone becomes an integrative thinker

185
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:42,120
later because it was trained out of everybody. I don't think it is actually necessary that people

186
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:51,720
learn that way. I think it's not even the case in say, pre-industrialized education, it just wasn't

187
00:18:52,680 --> 00:19:01,560
even the case in the same way. And so because my education was self-directed, it also didn't have

188
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:08,120
clear delineations of topics. I was never doing math or social studies. I was doing an inquiry

189
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,960
about something that was interesting that might have involved some math and some, you know,

190
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:19,320
quite a few things. So if you're trying to understand integrative things like how does a

191
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:25,480
body self-organize? How does a fetus actually develop? How does that? Then you're having to

192
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:32,520
intrinsically be radically interdisciplinary. What is worth doing in the world and how do we know?

193
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:38,920
So I think the most interesting questions are at a high enough level of abstraction that to address

194
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:44,680
them well, there's the taxonomy of questions beneath them is very interdisciplinary and you

195
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:52,840
actually have to bridge across them. So I do think a totally different educational paradigm

196
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:59,960
could have analysis and synthesis or integration on a knowledge that happening simultaneously

197
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:08,840
at each level of complexity. Yeah. And pulling together some of the things you've said,

198
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:15,960
you've spoken to your education, you've spoken to the natural integrative thinking that emerges

199
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:23,640
from a problem-solving approach to education as opposed to a compartmentalized scholastic

200
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:32,760
disciplinary approach. But also underlying this was sounds like a real desire for an

201
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:40,200
appreciation of the whole and a desire to optimize service. And it seems like what I'm

202
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:48,920
hearing is that those two things led you to this in big picture integrative approach to

203
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:56,680
understanding and responding to the great issues of our time. Yeah, I'll share a few other things

204
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:00,840
that I think were significant influences that I'm grateful for and that I think are interesting

205
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:10,760
for everybody to look at is... I think there's a good bit of evidence that the

206
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:17,800
people that many of us find to be some of the greatest exemplars of human potential

207
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:23,720
were the result of developmental paths that are more accessible to everyone than lots of people

208
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:35,000
or think. Not just some weird genetic or situational anomaly. And I'm not saying that genetics plays

209
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
no role in aptitude, of course it does. The height is a real thing that's going to affect

210
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,880
aptitude, size, whatever, and maybe does it do that for neural connectivity? Sure. But

211
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:57,480
I believe his name is Eric Hoel, who was an academic who started a very interesting blog recently,

212
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:03,240
published this article that then has gotten a lot of traction and debate around where

213
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:08,840
of all the super genius has gone. And it's a resource I think is really interesting and worth

214
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:13,640
people paying attention to. Of course, there are problems with what we think of as super genius

215
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:19,240
because might a aboriginal tracker who doesn't solve Rubik's cubes particularly well or do the

216
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,480
normal IQ things be a super genius in a totally different set of dimensions on things we can't

217
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:33,000
even perceive with our normal cognitive science kind of models, sure. But if we just take what

218
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:42,520
he was meaning here, he was saying it seems that the Isaac Newton's and Einstein's and

219
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:53,560
the people that contributed novel insights to many fields that specialists in those fields

220
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:58,360
appreciated and hadn't done, that we are seeing less of that recently than we have in a long time.

221
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,760
And this is a whole fascinating debate. I know I'm a bit off topic, but I find this an interesting

222
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:09,000
topic and maybe relevant. Some people think the idea that there is less super genius now is just

223
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,520
wrong and some kind of romanticizing the past, but there's pretty meaningful data in here in

224
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:21,240
terms of how quickly do new scientific insights happen or philosophical insights or legal insights

225
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:25,000
happen that are paradigm shifting that would change a Cooney and paradigm or something like that.

226
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,200
Some people think it's that there's just so much more fucking knowledge now than there was that you

227
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,720
just can't be a polymath that you could have been a polymath before and all the stuff and

228
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:38,920
nobody can now that it takes all of your life to be a specialist in a tiny discipline and that the

229
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:43,320
only thing that can make breakthroughs now is huge teams of specialist scientists with big data

230
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:51,480
processing AIs. There's a lot of different ideas about it. Feynman famously said that he thought

231
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,400
he would be in the last generation of great physicists for some time based on what he saw

232
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:02,440
happening in the direction of physics and the direction of education and there have certainly

233
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,840
been some developments in physics since but maybe not of the type from modern physics to him.

234
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:14,520
I think there is some truth in this that has that we are actually developing people of that type

235
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:19,240
less globally independent of the increasing complexity of the world as also a factor.

236
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:26,920
I think there's a few reasons for it but one of them that seems to be pretty compelling and so this

237
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:33,880
this article about where the super genius has gone puts forth that there is a lot of data

238
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:39,640
that points to the idea that most of the great polymaths the super geniuses if you want to call

239
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:44,920
it were have one thing really clearly in common obviously not a hundred percent correlation but

240
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:50,280
a higher correlation than anything else which was that they were the result of aristocratic tutoring

241
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:58,040
high quality aristocratic tutoring and that post the kind of modernity and democratic

242
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:04,600
reformation of the world there was no aristocratic tutoring of the same kind and that it really makes

243
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:11,960
a difference so if you think about it this little boy in Tibet identifies certain bulls

244
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:16,200
in pain so we say he's the Dalai Lama from a reincarnation perspective but then how does he

245
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:24,520
get educated right yeah right the top llamas in Tibet who are the top meditators and oracles and

246
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:28,920
philosophers and historians and scholars and mathematicians are all privately training this

247
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:34,760
boy with the investment of their entire culture is the Dalai Lama the result of an educational

248
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,840
paradigm that doesn't really scale because how could you have the best teachers of a whole

249
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:45,080
peoples you know for everybody and is the Dalai Lama's type of consciousness and capacity

250
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:49,000
actually something that could be trained if people had access to that it's a fair question

251
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:57,720
when you read meditations by Marcus Aurelius which is also a great philosophic text the first

252
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:03,240
chapter he dedicates just to his tutors right the intact like he writes the book of stoic philosophy

253
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,160
as the emperor of Rome and the first chapter is just a dedication to his tutors because when

254
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:12,280
you're being raised to be the emperor of Rome during Rome's high period the best mathematician

255
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:17,880
in all of Rome is your math teacher and the best historian and there was another study I had seen

256
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:23,560
I find this theory of education stuff so deeply fascinating there's a study I'd seen that was

257
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:30,760
looking at world class or what were considered first rate mathematicians and they had some way

258
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:35,160
of defining what a first rate mathematician was and it wasn't just a field's medal it was something

259
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:40,920
some set of things but the highest statistical correlator they could find across everyone who

260
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:45,560
became a first rate mathematician to see like is there some trait that where we can predict this

261
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,400
is that when they were young they started to study with a first rate mathematician

262
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:55,160
and of course someone could do a correlation causation question and say was it only because

263
00:26:55,160 --> 00:27:00,600
they had such exceptional ability that a first rate mathematician paid attention to them when

264
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,760
they were young but it does not appear that that is the direction of causation that they

265
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:09,560
got exposed to a first rate mathematician was teaching at their particular school for a while

266
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,320
at the time whatever because there are certain classes where a whole bunch of them came out of

267
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:18,920
that class where that teacher was and it makes sense because your average first grade or 12th

268
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:24,920
grade math teacher at a high school is not a first rate mathematician they're not even a second or

269
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:29,800
third rate mathematician the the brilliance of mathematical thinking the love of it the insight

270
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:34,040
the passion they don't have it they have something else right they study to be an educator they study

271
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,240
in a country that couldn't pay you all that much to be an educator so they aren't even a first

272
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:43,640
rate educator so can you learn how to think like a first rate mathematician from a normal math teacher

273
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:49,400
who is themselves someone who has never even had thought like that probably not and the same would

274
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:55,400
be true for spiritual insight or for anything else and so when you look at Marcus Aurelius you're

275
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,960
like it was who he was actually just the result of a good educational model and

276
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:08,520
when the modern democracies were forming the idea of feudalism was so disgusting and

277
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,440
were pregnant for many reasons and had to be shed away that anything that was a remnant of

278
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:17,800
feudalism had to be put away but in democratizing education to raise higher education for so many

279
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:23,880
people you also lowered the highest version of education to where the wealthy people whose

280
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:28,600
kids are getting tutoring today is to keep up with the normal scholastics of a curriculum based thing

281
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:37,560
it's not a personalized tutoring system for the most part and so I do partly why I was bringing

282
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:43,960
this up is that you know I didn't have a whole field of tutors but I had parents that were doing

283
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:51,160
that with me and then because I saw how valuable it was to have invested people be in that level

284
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:57,320
of dialogue I started seeking out tutors before I even knew this and this is like maybe the highest

285
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:05,640
thing I can recommend to young people or for parents what to do with their kids I somehow

286
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:10,120
knew because I also had stuff like think and grow rich and the kind of like tenacity of a

287
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:14,440
Carnegie to be self-directed as part of the thing but hopefully along a different set of goals than

288
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:19,480
just monetary accumulation but if you have the tenacity of a Carnegie associated with other

289
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:25,480
developmental goals which would be a really good thing whenever I found a teacher that seemed like

290
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,960
they knew something I really wanted to learn I figured out what I could possibly do to be useful

291
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:36,440
to them and that looked like cleaning their house and changing babies diapers and learning skills I

292
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,120
didn't have they needed electrical done I would learn electrical to those like whatever the fuck

293
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,560
it is this is where I want to study from so I'm going to figure out how to be around them and be useful

294
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:51,480
to them and so much of my learning was not what I studied in university that was cool or even just

295
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:57,080
in books on my own it was people who were really really fucking brilliant spending time with me

296
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:01,400
directly because I figured out how to partly I was a gift and partly I figured out how to make that

297
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:08,200
happen and Daniel is part of what you're saying as far as the tutor also a mentor relationship

298
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:14,200
having older people that can not only just download information but somehow impact your soul and your

299
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:21,240
being and you know it's all together see in a mentoring relationship they're not just topical

300
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:26,840
artists right they're who have because they're teaching to a whole class have to teach a curriculum

301
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:32,120
you're the kid is asking them questions that they're interested in the range beyond their

302
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:38,680
subject matter and the and the teacher in that relationship actually cares about them and loves

303
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:42,280
them and gets invested in their education so they ended up getting the benefit of something like good

304
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:46,360
parenting but multiplied by a lot more people a lot more capacities that error correct each other

305
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:52,600
and so the cognitive education shouldn't be limited to one domain separate from others it

306
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:56,520
should go across the domains but it shouldn't be limited to just cognitive education it should be

307
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:03,880
that the you know and so first the various domains of ontology need to integrate it you need to be

308
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:09,960
able to think about biology and chemistry and physics and etc together next is you have to

309
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,880
integrate a cross ontology and epistemology whenever the kid is learning something it's not

310
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:18,200
just here is how it works it's why does it work that way how is that discovered that this is one

311
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:27,160
of the next key insights is I never wanted to know a formula in math I wanted to know how long

312
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:31,320
people knew that that problem was interesting and didn't have the formula who discovered at first

313
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:35,640
what novel thing about their life gave them that insight what other new things they discovered

314
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:42,600
afterwards because of that you know like I wanted to know the epistemology and I find that when you

315
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:48,920
get that and you start to get what is the generator function of novel insight what is across all the

316
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:53,000
domains the the people who discovered the most important thing what was happening in them that

317
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,080
made them discover the most important thing you can start to develop that in yourself rather than

318
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:03,000
just a huge knowledge set in which case we're just shitty computers and so you want to integrate

319
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,080
all the ontologies you want to integrate ontology and epistemology and then all of that in the

320
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:12,440
cognitive domain you want to integrate to why do you care at all why do you care to want to learn so

321
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:17,960
the ethics the aesthetics the pragmatics also come in and the identity of the person in relationship

322
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:25,480
to it comes in and and and is there a developmental sense of responsibility that's transmitted it's

323
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:30,440
like I don't want to let my dad down my mom down these people that taught me I want to live up to

324
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,240
the the quality of the love and the gifts and the knowledge that they're imparting to me

325
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:39,480
you know

326
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,680
people being motivated to care about

327
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:57,480
people and animals and life forms that they will never meet and will never give them credit

328
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:02,120
like it takes some work it takes some developmental work to get there enough that

329
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:08,680
you'll make real sacrifices to care where you don't get any obvious credit for that it takes

330
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:15,640
having some sense of your identity expanded beyond your own individual self where you're

331
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:19,800
looking through their eyes right and you're and you get that they actually matter to you

332
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:31,000
reality but at first if somebody believes in a sky god that is all knowing all seeing and

333
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,480
internal punishment if you fuck up and they know your thoughts so you can't just virtue signal

334
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:41,000
because you can't virtue signal the god that knows it and eternal reward if you get it right so

335
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
even if you're really just a shithead who just doesn't want to get punished and wants to get a

336
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,320
reward you still have to be good all the way down to the level of your thoughts that's kind of awesome

337
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:53,240
right like from the point of view of just how do you get a lot of people who might still be

338
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:58,120
narcissists in a low degree of truly ethical development to do the right thing that kind of

339
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:05,240
like sky god judicial system is kind of awesome and another now it's also terrible because then

340
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,760
of course everybody's terrified of burning in hell forever and has to think that someone else

341
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:13,560
who's not getting it right is and they have to terrify their kids of burning in hell but

342
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:21,240
but in the same way the idea that many many traditions had that when I die I'm going to be

343
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:29,960
with the ancestors and I'm going to like and there's some glory of my of the great teachers

344
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:36,120
and will and they're still watching me right and and when I go to be with my forefathers

345
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:42,440
with the teachers in eternity and afterlife do I actually deserve to be with them

346
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:47,160
there's something in noble that can do right there's something powerfully ennobling that

347
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:52,040
old tradition can do of course we also find out that our great teachers are people that have their

348
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,880
failings and weaknesses and we have to wrestle with that and we're going to have our own failings

349
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:59,000
and weaknesses and we might get intellectually congruent enough to have some doubts on the

350
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:06,600
metaphysics of that thing but there is there is definitely something even if you don't go to

351
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:13,800
the metaphysics the afterlife version there is something about feeling that you received

352
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:18,280
something that you don't get to take credit for that you're fortunate that someone else was born

353
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:23,320
into a situation that if you were born into you'd be doing less well and that you were fortunate to

354
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:29,800
get to have these experiences and that you owe something to them and to the future world because

355
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:38,520
of that fortune I think that's really important anyway I've got to bring this up preparing for

356
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:43,720
this I went to your websites and I came across a blog article you've written things that I learned

357
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:53,240
from my dad I was deeply moved by this I halfway through when we got to the part how to treat women

358
00:35:53,240 --> 00:36:01,320
I think I started weeping and immediately I like your father but I like you because this is what

359
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:09,880
you remembered from your father and it was so incredibly powerful and basic and I see such a

360
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:19,400
need for young men to be initiated into some sort of positive manhood and what your father laid out

361
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,080
I got a lot from my father but obviously he was not as articulate as your dad

362
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:27,960
that he lived a lot of these principles that you were talking about and can I read one of them

363
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:40,680
I love this the highest value for men is serving women nature and children future generations

364
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,360
the highest value for men

365
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:48,920
you should shout it from the rooftops that's incredibly profound

366
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:56,520
yeah my dad would say things all the time like you're either serving your family or the family

367
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:01,080
of mankind or your off-path those are the only two things that you can be doing that are not off-path

368
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:09,960
and the family of mankind was the term used but inclusive of life not just human life

369
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:21,240
yeah I mean I wrote that because my dad's health was very delicate at the time and it wasn't clear

370
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:28,440
if he was going to be around much longer or not and so often people write a eulogy of all the things

371
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,360
that they appreciated from their parent after they're dead and they don't get to experience it

372
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:39,880
directly and I thought that that would be a loss and so I wanted to write it for that reason

373
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:45,400
but I also wanted to write it that particular one is definitely not a full expression

374
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:51,400
of what I learned from my dad it was called things I learned about being a man from my dad

375
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:57,640
and so it was it was definitely oriented to the

376
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:03,720
principles that have to do with transfer of masculinity as opposed to just would be equally

377
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:09,080
true for all people some of them are of course that and part of the reason that I wrote it at

378
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:17,240
that time was I think I had had in conversations a rise in the week or two before of

379
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:29,400
men young men so boy into man phase who had just clearly never been fathered in important ways

380
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:35,000
and were causing pain to women they were in relationships with to people around them were

381
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:45,400
being or leaders and it was just I was like there are so many people that didn't have so many men

382
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,960
that are in their masculine role not having the fortune of having had a good role model of

383
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:57,080
teaching in that way and I wonder if some tiny little bit of vicarious element of it can come

384
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:03,080
through by writing about it so that's why I wrote that one in that way I think it came through for

385
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:09,800
me brother thank you for that and one of the things he said is like on your time off what you

386
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:14,200
do is you get in your pickup truck this was before cell phones and all and you drive around and find

387
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:19,080
people are having trouble with their cars getting them started you you fix their cars and send them

388
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:23,320
on their way and he said that's a good time that's the way to spend your day off and it's all

389
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:31,320
his orientation noble disinterested service and it's just anyway but it was so funny because

390
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:37,240
yeah this was before cell phones and so when someone broke down on the side of the road

391
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:43,560
pulling over to pick them up was an important thing and you know my I think part of teaching

392
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:51,240
someone about how the world works in general and also part of the ideas and I understand this is

393
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:59,880
normative like by gender normative thinking on the thing that is how it was given to me

394
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:09,800
was that for a boy growing into a man knowing how to solve problems and fix things

395
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:16,360
was a particularly important thing so anytime there was construction to do he always involved

396
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:20,680
me and it even were involving me and it took a lot more time than doing it without me because

397
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:26,680
he was not just trying to fix the thing he was also trying to raise a child who would someday

398
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:31,000
not just be an adult but would themselves be a parent and a teacher and how to

399
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,760
do that thing properly and whenever there was something to fix on the car it took

400
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:43,160
10 times longer to show me how to do it and you know then then not and so but then it was also

401
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:48,040
while we're fixing the car there were so many things like if a job is worth doing it's worth

402
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:53,080
doing well and well begun is half done and see the job do the job stay out of the misery these

403
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:59,320
kind of idioms and the if the job is worth doing it's worth doing well meant just no half-assing

404
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:04,920
the thing like we and so like I'll give you an example that was so beautiful I remember the

405
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:12,520
first time we're building a building from the ground up we laid the studs and then we drilled

406
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:20,360
to the studs to run the wire for the outlets and it was very important to my dad that the way the

407
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:28,280
wiring was in the wall before the drywall went on was beautiful that the holes were at the same

408
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:34,200
height that the Romex was not twisted and that it was beautiful and no one would ever fucking see it

409
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:41,480
we're about to cover it in drywall and you're like why and he's like you know you know you know

410
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:47,640
it's an incredible teaching that's and there's something where it's like the if you can do it

411
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:52,760
any of the ways do it the way that is the most integrous the most awful the most beautiful

412
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:57,640
and you will feel better about it and you'll feel better about who you are and then your

413
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,920
unconscious default in the moments where it matters and other things will be to do the

414
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:04,760
thing in the highest way you possibly can as opposed to asking the corner cutting questions and

415
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:11,480
um so the if it's worth doing it's worth doing well see the job do the job stay out of the misery

416
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:18,600
meant uh don't even ask if it's possible and definitely don't bitch about it just if it needs

417
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:24,520
done figure out how to do it and do it with the best attitude because you have choice over your

418
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:31,000
attitude and why would you do it any other way um and well begun is half done meant have you

419
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,760
cleaned the space first have you set out the tools do you know what the workflow is going to be

420
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:38,360
because the problems that are going to come up when you've opened everything up it's up on the

421
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:41,720
jacks and you realize you're missing something and you have to go to the store like that's where

422
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:44,840
the danger happened that's where someone gets hurt that's where the inefficiency happens that's

423
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:53,400
so think through the process pretty well first um and anticipate where the mistakes and the

424
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,200
problems and the challenges are going to happen there's so much of my work in the

425
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:00,680
metacrisis that is anticipate where the unanticipated externalities going to happen

426
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:08,280
and then internalize those future externalities into the choice making process better and uh yeah

427
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:18,360
yeah like I can see now how you are basically uh self-taught and coached and mentored into

428
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:26,680
uh into the ideals which would lead you into a life of service into a way of thinking

429
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:36,680
which would bring you into a big picture approach and into a planning mode that would allow you to

430
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:46,200
anticipate second third order complications and to think through those to uh you were honed for

431
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:51,720
the work you're doing now wait there's something that I was starting to say it's important please

432
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,760
remember your thought because I don't want you to forget it but I don't want to forget this

433
00:43:55,560 --> 00:44:01,080
but you were you had um mentioned John the um that a fun time was to load up the tools

434
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:04,520
and go looking for people who are broken down and fix up their car because

435
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:07,560
AAA wouldn't necessarily come all the time especially if it was snowing outside they

436
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:16,760
could actually be in danger um so obviously that meant you know there I had to know some

437
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:23,880
how to fix a car type skills so I was mentioning that my dad would take a lot more time to do the

438
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:27,800
thing than pay someone else to do it and to do it with me than do it on his own because he was

439
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:35,080
wanting me to learn learning these other deeper psychological spiritual integrity lessons along

440
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:40,760
with it like well begun is half done and if a job's worth doing this worth doing well but then

441
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:47,960
also um learning the mechanical engineering of why was the screw threaded this way rather than the

442
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:53,160
other way and why was the sting built this way and then the history of internal combustion engines

443
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:59,640
and when the transmission came out and the um you know like and and then the physics of how

444
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:04,040
the explosion happens inside of the piston and so there's a very integrated set

445
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:10,840
of knowledge that was happening and that takes just a lot of investment right takes a lot of

446
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:18,360
care and a lot of investment and but then when we would do that it was like sunday father son

447
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:26,120
let's have fun um he wasn't into sports so we didn't throw a ball uh that's my my

448
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:30,760
anti-coordination at the level of ball throwing didn't develop all that much but we would uh

449
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:36,760
load the load the truck up with tools and go look for people who are broken down and fix it

450
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:44,280
up and the interesting thing was it didn't feel like some dreadful sacrifice of service that we

451
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:50,040
had to do the way that a lot of people um feel when they're doing some church activity as kids

452
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:54,360
they don't like it felt like the most fun thing we could possibly do like it was just actually

453
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:58,040
really enjoyable because one i'm getting this high quality time with my dad right he's not

454
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:03,640
trying to get me to go do the thing on my own who we're getting to be learning in the process

455
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:07,560
and then helping people where there's this immediate you know expression of these people

456
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:13,000
being delighted and surprised and so there was absolutely it wasn't just like an ethic of service

457
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:21,080
it was like a like a way to condition that as that the what i want for myself personally and

458
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:28,600
who i want to be for the world there wasn't even a distinction yeah beautiful yeah and

459
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:34,280
another thing your dad said and i'll stop parping on your dad i could go on and on this but he said

460
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:42,120
and this is so simple but so profound he said forgive just as a given you've got to forgive

461
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:48,920
and the second part is help them do better so you just don't forgive okay i'm okay i'm clear

462
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:53,720
you know i didn't bother anymore because i forgive him but the other part is help them

463
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:59,720
do better i just think that's one of my and i was a kid and there's a period where my

464
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:06,520
parents were in the tm community and built this beautiful community called lake view

465
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:12,280
estates out in fairfield and we're working on on the kind of enlightened theme park and

466
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:19,480
and a development business and there was someone that was an extremely close friend of the family

467
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:31,960
and um kind of employee and partner who had for whatever reasons um decided that he was going to

468
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:38,760
come into our house and steal a bunch of the artwork and uh because he you know had the

469
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:47,080
key to the house and all like that and uh you know but the trail like that oftentimes very easy to be

470
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:54,200
like want to be vindictive or at least totally cut ties i remember my dad intercepting him

471
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:58,200
not letting him do that and then taking him out and having this conversation like dude what the

472
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:03,800
fuck like what happened inside your head is this who you want to be and and there was still to like

473
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:13,800
help them do better um and one of the ones that really stood out to me and you know i there's

474
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:19,320
something where i feel torn about this first just as a caveat i must say the reason i didn't

475
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:24,520
write one about my mom at the time was because i don't think there is as gruesome a deficit of

476
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:30,120
mothering in the world as there is fathering currently and so i didn't have as many women

477
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:36,840
in sharing with me just like kind of abject failures of fundamental things as i had guys so

478
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:42,440
i was a little bit more motivated for that reason also her health is better but my mother is also

479
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:48,440
everybody's important in in my life and childhood and who i became and uh was the one that got me

480
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:53,240
into activism and had me going door to door with and had all the protests with pita and greenpeace

481
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:58,920
and all those things as a kid and got me studying art and introduced me to dolly and picasso and

482
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:04,200
jebron and blake and you know brought me to all the world religions churches and

483
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:14,840
but going back to my dad here my dad had a strong patriarchal line that taught him some

484
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:19,560
of these things his dad was first generation green beret and so that you know taught that way

485
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:23,960
but he also had a really fucked up childhood with a humongous amount of trauma

486
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:30,200
his dad commits suicide his sister commits suicide is many of his family members were in

487
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:38,440
and out of incarceration in mental institutions and and the violence of the childhood he was in

488
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:45,720
he's covered in physical scars from weapons you know like he had a rough go of it and so

489
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:52,760
some of what he got he got directly but a lot of it was his way to not kill himself was to say

490
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:57,080
maybe he's not crazy the entire world is crazy because the whole world he was exposed to seem

491
00:49:57,080 --> 00:50:04,600
completely crazy to him and he'd rethink everything from scratch and so when you do that you come up

492
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:08,520
with a lot of good and interesting things and also are going to make a lot of mistakes and

493
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:14,040
their painful parts in the process and I didn't emphasize those in that letter because it wasn't

494
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:23,240
the purpose of the letter the article but you know my path benefited from all the extreme

495
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:30,360
gifts and it had some like quite interesting hardships as a result of the complexity of

496
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:36,520
who he was from transcending his life all those other things is what got me into therapy young

497
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:41,080
and which I'm also very grateful for because then I ended up getting a huge amount of

498
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:46,040
you know basically parenting from the therapeutic traditions

499
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:54,600
the reason I say that is so that people don't think oh well I can't do well because I had trauma

500
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:58,920
because I didn't have some of these gifts I everybody's life has some gifts and has some

501
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:02,840
fucked up stuff and the difficult stuff the healing of it is what catalyzes their gifts

502
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:08,920
and I just want to say that and some of the gifts that he had were really

503
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:15,640
fairly rare and unusual I'm very grateful for that some of the issues he had were somewhat

504
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:24,360
unusual but when it comes to one of the things on the forgive he definitely had the gift of being

505
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:30,040
physically heroic and there are military men who are trained in that a lot of people are not

506
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:33,880
in this age physically heroic in previous ages that was much more common

507
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:40,040
and there was a time here in Encinitas when I was like 20

508
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:45,640
where which is usually not a violent area my dad was in the

509
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:53,640
parking lot on thoroughfare here El Camino Real gunshots rang out handful of gunshots

510
00:51:54,200 --> 00:52:03,480
from a blind store and everybody who was in the parking lot ran the other way or dropped my dad

511
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:09,720
ran straight at the blind store he figured the shooter was still alive and in there turned out

512
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:14,840
the shooter after killing the other person killed himself so by the time my dad got in there the

513
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:22,040
shooter was dead it was a husband who was going in there to suicide homicide his wife

514
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:32,200
and the but he shot himself he stabbed her and when he thought he had finished killing her

515
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:40,280
then he shot himself when my dad got there she was bleeding out but not dead and so he started

516
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:45,000
to put compression and turn the kits and whatever on you know all the areas where the ambulance

517
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,440
and police came but then he went to the hospital to be with her and then followed up with her

518
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:58,680
afterwards and in addition to like she would have bled out if he was not there saving her life

519
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:05,720
was him wanting to make sure that she could forgive her husband for that because of knowing how

520
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:10,920
fucked up he was and that he's no longer you know in pain himself or a risk to anybody else

521
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:17,160
but that was like it was his default mode and I mean almost too fast that it can be a bypass

522
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:23,080
but in that moment it was both and you know just a very interesting thing about him is like

523
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:29,160
thinking the shooter was still alive he thought I can keep my body moving long enough if I take

524
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:34,840
shots that I can take him out and more civilians won't get killed which means he was willing to

525
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:39,160
risk his life for people he had never met didn't even couldn't even see to know what color they were

526
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:45,240
a race or whatever this is very noble very beautiful and then the moment the harm of the

527
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:49,880
dying was out of the way the harm of her holding on to that grudging sentiment was the next one he

528
00:53:49,880 --> 00:54:02,760
was focused on. What a gift to be exposed to and live with someone like that and not only an education

529
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:13,320
but a transmission of normal values and priorities and to take up a theme a question I began with a

530
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:20,280
little while ago as you've described this it's getting more and more clear how your life has been

531
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:30,840
self-developed and honed and gifted by multiple people to bring you to your life's work which has

532
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:40,040
been the metacrisis and how we as a species and a civilization can continue because clearly we're

533
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:46,040
in danger right now and presumably will be forever after because the technology is probably only

534
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:55,560
going to get more developed and greater capacities etc so you've been you've been you've had these

535
00:54:55,560 --> 00:55:04,360
ideals of service transmitted to you've had attitudes of handling them schoolfully looking

536
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:13,240
for complications thinking ahead etc you've also had the multidisciplinary education so how does the

537
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:23,400
how does the to these depths the spiritual depths that and self-inquiry you've gone through not

538
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:29,800
only in spirituality but in psychotherapy and philosophic inquiry how do these how do these

539
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:37,800
depths inform you about our contemporary crises and what do you see lacking that these

540
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:53,800
these steps when these depths aren't appreciated what do we miss

541
00:55:54,760 --> 00:56:09,880
I was speaking with a friend recently who does conservation work and she's a brilliant conservationist

542
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:19,720
who has kept huge important areas of high biodiversity intact and has done so at a

543
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:24,200
significant devotion including expense of her own personal life and in other areas

544
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:35,160
we're talking and she had just been in conversation with some of the world's wealthiest people

545
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:45,160
and she asked me when someone asks why should we protect nature how to answer it

546
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:55,400
because that was obviously their question and I said well there's a lot of answers that we can give

547
00:56:56,520 --> 00:57:03,400
that from a you from the utility perspective of helping them get why they should care we

548
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:07,400
we look at what they currently care about and we show a rationalized argument between why

549
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:12,680
the harm that would come to nature would harm something they would care about right we draw

550
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:19,960
those connections but before getting there the fact that someone has to ask that question in

551
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:27,320
earnest speaks to something broken in them at minimum something pathologically underdeveloped

552
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:37,320
and if they had had a life where they grew up in any real contact with their own embodiment

553
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:42,280
their own kind of biology and experience of being in a body being and in any real contact with

554
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:48,520
nature and other sentient beings that question just wouldn't even arise

555
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:54,920
it would be prima facie right it would be it would be obvious and the question would simply be

556
00:57:54,920 --> 00:58:06,920
how do we do a better job with it and I saw one of the in the brief look one of the questions

557
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:13,720
that you sometimes explore with guests of like what are the questions that orient their relationship

558
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:22,680
to the sacred and I think at the at the heart of it it's not even a question right it's a

559
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:32,840
something more like a perception I think if someone is perceiving somewhat clearly

560
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:43,240
then the sacredness of life is prima facie just is and I don't remember the exact quote but it was a

561
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:49,240
Joseph Campbell quote that was something to the effect of

562
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:56,520
that we think what we want is to know what the meaning of life is when what we're

563
00:58:56,520 --> 00:59:01,480
actually seeking is the experience of being fully alive and I don't think that is the whole

564
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:05,240
because someone can experience being fully alive in fairly self-centered ways just doing

565
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:13,400
you know extreme sports and whatever but it is also true that in the moments where someone is

566
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:17,960
experiencing feeling fully alive they're not an existential angst about what is the meaning of life

567
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:25,800
and I think that oftentimes the actual intrinsic sacredness and meaningful of

568
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:32,200
meaningfulness of life that happens through a deep enough bandwidth of connection and sensing

569
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:42,680
the longing for that it's filtered through the mind as a desire to understand what is the purpose

570
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:46,920
of all of this what is the meaning with a whole bunch of bad assumptions about like what thing is

571
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:54,040
it building to that seems like a terminal value that then I can't then that will be a satisfying

572
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:57,560
answer where if we say well the purpose is love then I say well what is the purpose of that or

573
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:06,120
the purpose is learning well what is the purpose of it it's so we can the first the concept of

574
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:11,960
purpose and the concept of meaningfulness are not identical but the reality of them and the

575
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:26,520
concept of them are not the same either and so how to develop a deeper connection to the

576
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:35,960
a deeper connection to life and deeper ability to perceive the innate uniqueness of everything

577
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:39,800
and the interconnectedness of everything at the same time right the interconnectedness of it all

578
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:46,360
but not it's not it's not a homogenous oneness where because if it's a homogenous oneness

579
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:49,960
it doesn't matter how many of these ones die it doesn't matter if the species goes the oneness

580
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:55,480
is still oneness if it is just uniqueness but not interconnectedness well then in the service

581
01:00:55,480 --> 01:01:00,600
of this one I can damage these ones it's every part unique and every part radically interconnected

582
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:06,680
in which case it is all an expression of the whole so I whatever I care about I also have

583
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:11,080
to care about all of it because it's connected and also each part is irreplaceable and those

584
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:16,440
totally precious right and it's not that is the thought it's that is the perception

585
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:25,720
from there from that base state of perception I think the right other questions and analytics

586
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:35,480
more naturally arise yes so the to the extent we can open ourselves to

587
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:46,280
the totality of experience to to life the world and to ourselves to that extent in some ways

588
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:51,720
and so in one sense one could say the questions fall away because the questions are conceptual

589
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:56,920
and we're you're now speaking to an experiential openness and directness

590
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:06,840
that give birth to understandings or intuitions which can flower into concepts

591
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:13,240
obviously I'm obviously into concepts right I'm obviously into work

592
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:20,440
you're a good company um I wrote a blog piece a while ago called the dance of the

593
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:26,120
Tao and the 10 000 things and maybe that one can be linked I'm specifically talking about that because

594
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:34,760
you know there's this concept in Taoism that every day in the practice of knowledge something is

595
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:42,040
added every day in the practice of the Tao something is dropped and but I think they are

596
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:50,040
both meaningful and I think that not only there's a way in which learning more about the 10 000

597
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:56,440
things the field of conceptuality and interfere with one's connection to the Tao there's a way

598
01:02:56,440 --> 01:03:01,480
that it can also enhance it yes you don't know how they can dance together if you don't know how it

599
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:09,880
can enhance it then you have to just avoid intellect mind past future mostly the things

600
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:14,440
that are uniquely sapient uniquely adult sapient and say look at the lilies of the field look at

601
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:17,960
the little children you're like yes the things that don't have the prefrontal cortex yes the

602
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:23,240
prefrontal adult brain can cause problems but it also has unique evolutionary purposes we just

603
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:30,520
have to use it right um and two things there Daniel one one is the intention what's the intention

604
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:35,800
of using the intellect is it to get lost in the abstractions or is it in the service of the solution

605
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:43,400
and the other is the skill and capacity to integrate into a kind of vision logic say

606
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:49,560
I think those are both part of it I had a friend that I think you know Samantha Sweetwater

607
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:55,080
she hasn't been on this podcast she'd be great to be on she just left me a message this morning with

608
01:03:56,280 --> 01:04:02,360
a thought she was saying the way she phrased it was that sapience is in service of sentience

609
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:09,000
if it is to be rightly guided oh I thought that was a nice way of phrasing it I um

610
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:15,240
in terms of the Greek the true the good and the beautiful triad I remember writing to an

611
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:21,480
artist friend of mine on her birthday once uh that the true and the good only matter because

612
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:27,800
the beautiful is um or no I think I said truth and goodness only matter because beauty is that

613
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:32,760
the beauty was actually the fundamental thing if reality did not have intrinsic beauty I wouldn't

614
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:37,640
actually care to be good to it or to know it or to whatever there's something that is intrinsic

615
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:44,360
that is deeper than the why Daniel I plenty yeah I have a follow-up question to all this

616
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:52,040
and I know they they threw it at Carl Young so uh I'm gonna throw it at you do you believe in God

617
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:02,200
I remember many many years ago and I wouldn't phrase it this way

618
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:09,400
any what more and there's maybe 15 years ago I wrote a poem called uh the atheist who writes love

619
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:21,560
poems to God and um it was saying do I believe in God not in any God that is believable meaning

620
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:28,680
that I don't remember where it went but the idea that what the word belief means is

621
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:41,000
the idea that a proposition about reality actually maps to reality and so belief is a

622
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:47,880
thing that can happen inside of propositional logic and propositions have to be formed in

623
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:58,440
semiotics right in in semantics and syntax do I believe that there is some sentences that I can

624
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:07,960
say that define what God is uh where I would say yes that is a description that I think is both

625
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:13,160
true and comprehensive and you know adequate and no I don't I think that's why the first verse of

626
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:16,760
the Tao Te Ching is the Tao that is speakable it's not the eternal Tao so if you believe in the Tao

627
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:26,440
you missed the whole fucking thing um if you you can have a outside of semiotics outside of

628
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:33,080
propositional experience outside of propositional knowledge experience of a kind of wordless knowing

629
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:39,480
in a connection to wholeness but you don't then try to reduce that to propositions about the world

630
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:42,680
so I think there's a lot of people that will have

631
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:51,320
real experiences that are numinous and transcendent and then try to make a belief based on that

632
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:59,800
and I think that's usually misguided so uh if I wanted to speak to beliefs do I think

633
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:08,840
that consciousness is an emergent property of brains probably not do I think that there

634
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:15,240
are things that don't have brains including other types of biology and whatever that might

635
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:21,240
have some quality or there is something that is like to be them probably yes but I'm holding all

636
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:29,400
this I say probably even though I think there's some pretty strong arguments uh because I I think

637
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:36,680
too much certainty about any of these things is really problematic um do I think that

638
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:45,080
it might not just be biology but that anything that self-organizes has some type of interiority

639
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:55,080
or self-ness in some kind of panpsychic type way yeah sure I do do I think that um

640
01:07:56,920 --> 01:08:01,320
even though each cell in our brain or body is its own self-organizing thing they come together to

641
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:05,880
make something that is synergistically more than the sum of them taken separately yes do I think

642
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:13,160
that might be true for say universe as a whole or very large things within universe like galaxies

643
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:22,520
or whatever yeah I think that's interesting so do I think that um there are types of sentience

644
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:32,040
and types of intelligence that are more deep and vast by far than our imagination can think about

645
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:39,960
totally do I think that there is the possibility to in some meaningful ways

646
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:48,520
connect there and have results come from that connection yes do I think that there is an inherent

647
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:56,440
sacredness in all that is physically and metaphysically yes I wouldn't reduce all that to saying I

648
01:08:56,440 --> 01:09:09,560
believe in God I rather think of it as something more respectful than the reduction to a proposition

649
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:17,320
I get that yeah um but but I was actually just talking with um a very close friend the other day

650
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:24,760
about an aspect of learning theory there are certain things

651
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:39,320
that when I learn them I have to work to implement them as effectively as I can because

652
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:53,080
I can't not I just I can't not and uh and there are many people who don't have that they um they

653
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:57,400
forget like they learn the thing and they forget and they're like oh yeah that was about I forgot

654
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:01,320
let me get back on path are they there's some different depth of the care about the thing

655
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:05,960
that is of course the result of all the exposure and whatever and I'm like yeah there is something

656
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:11,880
where it is like actually like the difference is actually believing there's a god right meaning

657
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:19,400
but it and that was the term that I used to just kind of make it simple in which if one actually

658
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:25,560
believes there's a god then they can go they can work to perfect themselves go to happily

659
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:30,120
die in a holy war whatever it is because there is some superordinate thing that is so fucking

660
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:34,920
important that everything else falls in line to that so there there is something for me and

661
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:38,440
belief in karma can do that right there is something that is like believing in a god

662
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:45,640
that is the coordinating basis of everything for me but it isn't believing in a god

663
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:53,000
and I can't do better with words no that yes I think that's a very sacred holy answer I think

664
01:10:53,000 --> 01:11:00,120
you handled it really well and thank you for even even doing that means a lot yeah I'm beautiful that

665
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:07,720
certain that some of the some of the intimations in your response were

666
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:18,120
about to the uh unknowable mystery of reality bottomless fathomless inconceivable and to the

667
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:27,240
transconceptual nature of that mystery and actually of life that that the idea so the

668
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:34,840
doubt that can be named is not the eternal doubt and even more than that we can't any statement we

669
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:43,160
make is you know in fact it can be valuable but it's never fully adequate to the reality of anything

670
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:51,160
and to the extent that you think that you even unconsciously even fuzzily think of it as adequate

671
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:56,680
now it's actually harming you yes because now it deadens your perceptions now it creates

672
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:03,400
less you don't see the reality you see the frame of the reality that you expect to see it in and

673
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:07,640
you stop seeing where that model is inadequate which means you stop learning because you're

674
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:12,520
now filtering reality through that model because it's convenient so in that thing the dance of the

675
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:20,760
doubt and the 10 000 things there's one part where I say do atoms exist I'm like kind of kind of because

676
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:27,560
uh and I'm and I didn't play with it from the point of view of is there physicality at all or

677
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:33,480
is that all just an epiphenomenon of consciousness or is this a simulation I wasn't even playing

678
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:39,400
with it from that direction I was just saying do atoms exist well the periodic table works pretty

679
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:47,880
well we can actually uh do atomic level engineering and chemistry pretty well right this is it's about

680
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:57,000
as good a science as we've got there's a a lot of um good empirical things regarding atoms

681
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:05,720
but when I define an atom the formal definitions will like we can do it in terms of the Schrodinger

682
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:10,680
equation or information theory or particle physics or whatever but we'll say okay you've got nucleons

683
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:14,760
and you have electrons and you have orbitals and whatever um you can just say where in the

684
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:23,960
periodic table row and column it is and it's an ion or but does that atom exist without the strong

685
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:33,480
force does it exist without electromagnetism does it exist without the Higgs field does it exist

686
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:38,200
without the gauge bosons that mediate the connections the gluons and the Higgs boson it

687
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:42,200
doesn't exist without any of those things and yet none of them are included in the definition

688
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:47,640
when we say atom we take them all for granted so if I remove those that are not part of the

689
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:55,800
definition do atoms exist nope so if I want to define an atom adequately that it actually exists

690
01:13:55,800 --> 01:14:05,880
can I do that nope and so I have to take for granted a trans finite amount of reality

691
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:14,600
to define this thing in a way that is useful but is it real kind of you've walked your way into

692
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:22,200
the buddhist shunyata and into the why buddhist wayan philosophy of the concealed and the revealed

693
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:30,200
that any perspective unveils or conceals a universe and simultaneously conceals another one

694
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:37,240
this is absolutely fascinating we could go anywhere with this but I want to I want to ask you

695
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:46,200
from this this perspective or these multiple perspectives you're bringing to bear

696
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:53,320
on your own your understanding of of everything what do you see as some of the deeper

697
01:14:53,320 --> 01:15:02,360
unrecognized usually unacknowledged causes of the metacrisis and I'll just give a little context

698
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:08,040
and I think one of the beautiful things about the way the way you appreciate the metacons crisis

699
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:15,000
is you're very aware of the traps of reductionism or what I would call the single focus fallacy

700
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:25,240
which there are three a single issue fallacy the we're facing global warming that's it

701
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:32,040
a single cause fallacy it's all due to capitalism and the single solution fallacy so I love the way

702
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:39,240
you're thinking transcends those limitations and and recognize the traps of reductionism so

703
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:44,280
in asking you what you see as some of the deeper causes I certainly acknowledge that you don't

704
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:51,960
these aren't it but they are important elements and they're ones that don't often get don't as often

705
01:15:51,960 --> 01:16:04,040
get spoken to yeah okay so the question as I understood is are are there

706
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:12,680
drivers or causes of the issues we face in the world and of the thing that

707
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:19,480
I sometimes call the metacrisis that we haven't defined here but I'm defining enough other places

708
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:25,640
of someone who is not already familiar they can check it out that are not the ones that we usually

709
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:32,200
talk about that are somehow deeper and I'm going to translate that to are there things in the inner

710
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:40,920
landscape of people's experience and psyche specifically just when we were saying are there

711
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:47,320
spiritual dimensions or interior dimensions the reason I want to make the distinction is because

712
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:59,800
I don't know that the term deeper makes sense just for quick point of reference I would not say

713
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:05,400
that I am a physicalist or an idealist in the classic philosophical sense of

714
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:12,200
physicalist meaning that physics comes first matter and force fields and third person stuff and

715
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:18,280
that consciousness emerges from that somewhere nor am I an idealist and that consciousness comes

716
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:23,160
first and all of the physics is an emergent property of consciousness structures of mind or

717
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:35,320
something I would say that the the subjective stuff and the objective stuff have you want to

718
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:39,400
think of that all the words have problems we can talk about first person third person we can talk

719
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:50,280
about the quality and the physics but that they are equally fundamental and co-informing

720
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:56,440
co-arising facets of an integrated reality and the relationship between them is part of that

721
01:17:56,440 --> 01:18:03,640
fundamentality so I wouldn't say consciousness is deeper than physics to the nature of reality

722
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:12,360
I think that's a weird kind of dualism still I think information theory affecting physics has

723
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:18,920
already started to get a lot of people at least in this realm because if you say okay well consciousness

724
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:23,240
stuff is deeper than physics stuff and like well what is physics stuff well it's like atoms

725
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:29,720
atoms are subatomic particles and subatomic particles are some weird Heisenbergian Schrodinger

726
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:37,400
thing which seems a lot like some type of pattern of information that doesn't sound like physics

727
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:44,600
anymore right and it doesn't necessarily sound as different it's not like just some dead inert

728
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:47,960
matter it doesn't sound as different from the consciousness stuff especially as you start to

729
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:51,880
do a similar dive on what the consciousness stuff is because you say well is that information

730
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:57,640
processing on some information processing substrate what does that mean so in the same way

731
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:03,800
that I wouldn't say consciousness is deeper than physics or the other way around I wouldn't say that

732
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:11,240
the psychological drivers of the metacrisis are deeper than the technological or the economic ones

733
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:23,160
I would say that they are co-informing co-influencing and that to really address it there are necessary

734
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:28,680
things that have to happen across each of those areas and that sufficiency only happens across all

735
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:34,920
of them and I won't belabor the point because we've written and talked about it we wrote a

736
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:41,080
paper in the conciliance project called why technology is not values neutral

737
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:51,000
and it's worth people looking at and it shows just a brief overview of the work of

738
01:19:52,040 --> 01:20:01,080
Marvin Harris and Marshall McLuhan and so many people in theory of technology of how

739
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:07,960
technologies change the nature of mind and psychology individually and collectively the

740
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:15,640
nature of culture in ways that are really subtle and not not obvious so I you know there's always

741
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:26,040
this question of there's the what technologies the world develops and what social systems it

742
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:31,000
develops are those the result of the consciousness and values of the people or the consciousness

743
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:35,000
and the values of the people who are born as babies being conditioned by the world that they're in

744
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:40,040
and the dominant systems and what things happen to be successful and if the worldview and the

745
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:48,120
technology creates don't win a war it just gets wiped out and so I'm framing it this way because

746
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:53,560
I think the deeper thing is actually really problematic it's you mentioned

747
01:20:54,280 --> 01:21:01,000
um Roger the reductionism one type of reductionism is to say there's only one thing the other type

748
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:05,160
is say there's a handful of things but my favorite thing is the most important one um

749
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:13,720
and so being able to understand the co-arising and non-reduced process is actually really important

750
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:22,680
um if I can introduce if I can introduce the concept here Daniel I find I have a neologism

751
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:28,680
which is omnideterminism everything determines everything and I think that's what you're speaking

752
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:39,240
to yeah um yeah I might more usually talk about omni influence that everything is influenced

753
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:45,640
everything but not in a way that is absolutely deterministic because um nice refinement thank

754
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:52,200
you there are things that are outside of hard determinism still that influence the net result

755
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:58,440
of what happens also when we say omni we mean in the direction of all inclusive but we can never

756
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:06,840
actually know we're being all inclusive um so in fact we can know for sure that we aren't being

757
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:12,600
that's actually important um I can know for sure that I am not being all inclusive because

758
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:24,120
computationally it would be impossible um so the framing of the metacrisis we often talk about

759
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:32,920
involves like a frame I'll use often is um from Marvin Harris's work but to understand

760
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:38,440
its civilization you can think of it in terms of these three areas its infrastructure its

761
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:42,600
social structures and its superstructure its infrastructures all the technologies the whole

762
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:49,080
tech stack and all the modes of material development and like that the social structures are all the

763
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:54,760
collective agreement fields everything from the system of governance the law the institutions that

764
01:22:54,760 --> 01:23:01,400
mediate it and the superstructure is the religion the cultural ideology the values the definition

765
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:08,040
of the good life so the the superstructure is kind of the spirituality psychology

766
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:13,480
interiority of the people at the collective level and so of course we're always talking about that

767
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:19,560
so I think seeing the top level frame of how all those fit together is worthwhile so if people

768
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:27,000
haven't um I'll just reference talked about in a bunch of places a good friend Nate Hagins who's

769
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:33,160
very good thinker on um specifically the relationship between the environment and energy and the

770
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:39,240
financial system he and I just did a five part series on his podcast and then the fourth part

771
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:44,440
we do a kind of an overview of the metacrisis that covers this the third part unintentionally

772
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:51,720
just because it came up we ended up covering how does one like emotionally psychologically and

773
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:56,520
spiritually deal with the reality of the metacrisis given that there's so much to care about beyond

774
01:23:56,520 --> 01:24:00,200
what we feel like we have a sense of agency about those are ones that people might find

775
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:04,520
interesting the fifth one we talk about frameworks to think through solutions

776
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:11,400
competently so with all that prefacing I'll say some things here that I think maybe have not said

777
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:20,760
as much other places that are relevant to what in the interiority of human psyches and experiences

778
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:27,480
and cultures uh is a key or our key drivers of the problems of the world

779
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:35,560
I want to mention how many things there are that we probably have no fucking clue about

780
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:41,000
that are really critical just just to give a tiny couple examples

781
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:47,080
we know that there are a lot of species that have gone extinct at somewhere between 100 and

782
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:51,640
a thousand times the background rate of extinction since the industrial revolution as a result of

783
01:24:51,640 --> 01:25:01,080
human activity those species are not just in the world externally there is a similar biodiversity

784
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:09,000
loss and species extinction in the microbiome of the human being and the microbiome of the human

785
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:13,640
being produces some of the necessary chemicals for us to work our genome doesn't actually produce

786
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:18,920
all the things some aspects of the macrophage binding protein and various things like that

787
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:26,840
are not adequately coated in the genome without a microbiome and and so extinction of some of

788
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:32,520
those is pretty humongous it's like deleting chunks of our genome right and but if you start

789
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:37,640
having ubiquitous antibiotics and chlorine in the water and pesticide exposure and all those types

790
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:44,280
of things so how much when you realize that somewhere between 50 and 80 percent of the

791
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:49,880
major mono and amine neurotransmitters like dopamine serotonin and gob are produced by the

792
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:55,240
microbiome in the gut and that how you think how you perceive what you believe how happy you are

793
01:25:55,240 --> 01:26:00,840
what you your orientation towards violence will large to be or the result of that how much of

794
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:06,840
what seems like a spiritual crisis in the world is the result of the effects of the unintended

795
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:14,360
consequences of our kind of war on bacteria and biology and actually destroying part of the

796
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:21,160
code set that makes us able to be us that's not something that people often would think of when

797
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:27,640
they're thinking of the spiritual drivers of a thing but that is really important and if we

798
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:34,760
you know if we look at the Anthropocene at the human built world there are so many aspects of

799
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:38,680
the human built world that built a world we did not genetically evolve in we're not genetically

800
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:47,000
adapted to that makes us misfit to our own being in important ways um obviously for the

801
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:53,800
200,000 or 300,000 years of homo sapien history and the couple million years of hominin history

802
01:26:56,040 --> 01:27:01,720
we always lived in tribes there was no such thing as not living in tribes until extremely

803
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:06,440
recently but we've been this way long enough that it seems like the nuclear family household

804
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:09,720
was the most obvious thing and the only thing that could ever be and we can't really imagine

805
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:15,080
anything else and yet it evolutionarily we evolved to fit in tribes so we so all the

806
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:22,440
shit about attachment theory we we evolved to have attachment to like 150 people like strong

807
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:30,200
attachments and where our life literally depended upon them we couldn't get our the the person who

808
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:32,920
knows medicine it's the only person who knows medicine i'm not going to interact with other

809
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:36,920
people so i can't just have a market opportunity to go to anybody so i actually need people and

810
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:40,840
they need me so i can't be a shithead to them so i and everybody's going to see what everybody

811
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:45,640
does so i can't lie and get away with it so like everything about psychology attachment theory

812
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:52,440
bonding the ideas of codependence and interdependence we're totally different and we evolved in that

813
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:58,280
setting right so then we get birth control and we're like oh sex doesn't have to equal reproduction

814
01:27:58,280 --> 01:28:03,080
anymore even though forever sex always equals possibility of reproduction we evolved to have

815
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:06,760
our neural chemistry means sex equals the possibility of reproduction we put in birth

816
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:11,960
control our neural chemistry and our evolutionary value didn't just change overnight but now we're

817
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:16,680
acting in a way where it's like as if it doesn't mean that thing but a huge part of our whole

818
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:22,520
being is responding that way so the reason i bring this up is if we were to try to comprehensively list

819
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:25,640
all of the things

820
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:31,880
that are conditioning our psyches in ways that they did not evolve

821
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:39,560
to process and that are not optimal for us at an individual thriving a community thriving

822
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:48,040
or a global thriving would be this podcast would take days um and so that's a big topic

823
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:56,120
i just want to yes um if and i say that because if i say anything else first i'm

824
01:28:57,080 --> 01:29:03,960
concerned that people over norm on that as the thing and then again lose observation to all

825
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:09,800
the things and complexity of all things so if i wanted to speak to something as the thing it would

826
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:17,400
be the nature of mind that makes us lose orientation to the complexity and the interconnectivity of

827
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:25,000
all the things um so if i if i was going to try to say what is the psychological generator function

828
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:32,120
of the metacrisis one i think as good a way of saying it as i could is kind of

829
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:40,920
not exactly the way david bone said it but it's derived from the way i heard him when he said the

830
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:47,480
problems of the world result from a fragmented consciousness that sees the world as a bunch

831
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:51,080
of parts and doesn't see the wholeness of things and he talked about wholeness in the

832
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:56,440
implicate order and can we perceive through that wholeness and obviously we know he was a student

833
01:29:56,440 --> 01:30:00,840
of einstein's and einstein said it's an optical delusion of consciousness to believe there are

834
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:06,200
separate things there is one thing that we call universe and that we have to work to develop our

835
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:16,280
perception um so some of the problems in the world happen by be by intentionally advantaging

836
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:21,240
some things at the expense of other things we know it'll cause an expense so we're advantaging

837
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:29,080
our country at the expense of another country in a war which means our people our land our

838
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:35,080
riches or whatever at the expense of that for those people um that obviously means we're able to

839
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:41,080
separate the world enough to be able to think about this trade-off of good for these ones

840
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:46,440
and even though we know it's bad for these ones okay because we separate the interconnectedness

841
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:52,040
of everything and whether it's a country doing that to another country or in a relationship

842
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:56,040
of a person doing that to another person thinking they can possibly win a fight and someone they

843
01:30:56,040 --> 01:30:59,480
love actually not get their needs met and that equals a good life for them somehow which is

844
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:09,640
fucking ridiculous idea um uh or at the level of corporations or anything else or humans with

845
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:13,400
regard to the biosphere or other animals we can advantage ourselves at their expense which

846
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:19,560
obviously a factory farm and an uh uh industrial fishing fleet are not good for those animals

847
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:23,480
are not good for the oceans are not good for the people working on them in poor conditions

848
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:29,720
the other problems in the world is where we didn't know that we're causing the harm right so we can

849
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:34,040
either benefit something at the expense of something else knowingly or we can benefit

850
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:38,520
something at the harm of something else not knowing so conflict theory and mistake theory

851
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:45,320
um and the real politic assessment of humans is the problems in the world are because we are

852
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:51,720
dumb and nasty right like roughly if you want to make it very simple dumb is we cause problems

853
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:56,840
that we didn't anticipate and nasty as we cause problems that we knew we're going to happen and

854
01:31:57,480 --> 01:32:02,440
so the how do we enlighten humans has to deal with both the dumb and nasty part right if we're

855
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:07,720
talking if we're talking about how do we have the not not just how do you affect human behavior

856
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:12,200
through different rewards and deterrents and social norms and systems of law but through people

857
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:17,640
wanting something different having an internal motivational basis it would be can we expand

858
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:24,920
the circle of care where they care about more that's the even the nasty part and can we expand the

859
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:29,800
complexity of process where they can actually calculate their effects so that they are not

860
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:35,880
unintentionally harming things more that's the deal with the dumb part um but similarly there if I'm

861
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:37,960
thinking about

862
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:46,280
co2 and how critical it is to get it down but I'm not thinking about ocean dead zones

863
01:32:47,640 --> 01:32:53,240
from nitrogen effluent using nitrogen fertilizer to grow more crops that will sequester more co2

864
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:57,800
seems like a good idea even though it's going to cause this other externalized issue

865
01:32:58,360 --> 01:33:03,560
so again my ability to separate the ocean dead zones and the co2 is what's causing that unintentional

866
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:09,320
right or thinking about that facebook will be some cool system for people being able to tag photos

867
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:13,240
and get to know each other not thinking about what its effect on democracy will be with that particular

868
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:24,840
ad model I would say all the problems look like people all the problems come from harm happening

869
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:29,240
somewhere as a result of human choice but the choice was motivated by someone trying to benefit

870
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:34,680
something so they're all based on tradeoffs so it's either I'm trying to benefit myself now at

871
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:42,600
my own future expense addiction and compulsiveness I am uh so the parts conflict can even be within

872
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:50,360
oneself right um I'm trying to benefit my people my religion my nation my political party whatever

873
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:54,760
at the expense of the other one so great you get your political party elected you polarize the

874
01:33:54,760 --> 01:34:00,120
population worse next time they'll swing back harder and you're actually not progressing anything

875
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:08,680
other than increasing polarization um or I am seeking to benefit things and the harm I'm

876
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:13,160
causing elsewhere I just didn't know I didn't know that leachate was going to cause that pollution

877
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:17,960
over there or whatever the other thing is so when bone was talking about the fragmented

878
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:24,680
consciousness it was both at the level of aware of the connectedness and care about the connectedness

879
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:34,360
and so really the key is seeing reality as parts right seeing reality as a bunch of separated parts

880
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:41,080
leads to being able to care about a part and seek to advantage it in a way that causes harm to

881
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:44,920
other things and then cascade effects of other agents doing this similar stuff and so you get

882
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:50,760
cumulative harm effects and you get escalating arms races so not being able to perceive stuff as a

883
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:55,080
bunch of separated parts but perceiving everything in relationship to everything else perceiving

884
01:34:55,080 --> 01:34:58,920
everything as a part of an interconnected whole where your ability to benefit that thing had to

885
01:34:58,920 --> 01:35:02,760
mean both caring about everything that it's connected to and being able to think through

886
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:07,960
everything that's connected to come up with a strategy that is omnibeneficial or as close to

887
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:13,000
that as possible and that where you made a mistake in it you're also ongoingly aware and working to

888
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:18,760
correct it I would say from the psychological perspective that's probably as deep a thing as

889
01:35:18,840 --> 01:35:25,480
we can say and even stuff like but aren't people wouldn't wouldn't we say impulsiveness and selfishness

890
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:30,360
and addiction are even deeper than that because obviously all of the environmental harm is happening

891
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:35,480
because people are buying too much shit to get a keep up with the Joneses or get a hit of something

892
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:42,520
well it's still the same thing right like it's it is still the thing of that their future self is

893
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:47,080
being harmed for their momentary self because their momentary self feels fucked up enough that it

894
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:54,360
thinks that it means to get ahead of it so the parts conflict the the theory of tradeoff starts

895
01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:59,480
within the self between the parts of itself the Jungian parts reconciliation then would be the

896
01:35:59,480 --> 01:36:05,400
basis for being able to also have a wholeness of self in relationship with the wholeness of world

897
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:08,840
um

898
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:19,160
yeah let me let me um a couple of things uh given that and I've listened to you talk about these

899
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:27,000
issues a lot and sometimes I'm just left with just oh we are so fucked you know but given that

900
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:39,800
the solution of survivability as our current species on this our home seems to be ignorance

901
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:48,200
and just uh being bad actors uh do you feel that enough of us that there's any kind of hope or

902
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:54,760
sense that enough of us can evolve to a level where we can recognize this fractured and recognize

903
01:36:54,760 --> 01:37:01,000
what we're doing enough to keep us together as a human family connected to the whole so that we

904
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:04,920
can survive this this choke point in our evolutionary history

905
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:18,680
I don't think there is much of a human family to keep together that is anything other than

906
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:23,560
an abstract idea at this point that some people hold and many people don't even hold

907
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:31,480
that's an ideal I think

908
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:38,440
the question of is it possible

909
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:50,920
to make it through the issues that the world is facing today the whole plurality of issues

910
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:55,480
that are unprecedented historically because we hadn't had centuries of industrial tech bringing

911
01:37:55,480 --> 01:38:01,240
us up to planetary boundaries and we hadn't had exponential tech or even small number of actors

912
01:38:01,240 --> 01:38:04,600
could fuck everything up so quickly and we didn't have a world that had so much fragility

913
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:13,080
given that we could have massive catastrophic harm from so many different vectors from synthetic

914
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:19,080
bio created pandemics and from AI autonomous drone weapons and from climate change and from

915
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:25,720
chemical planetary boundaries and from scaling war is there to make it through we have to avoid

916
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:32,600
all of those to fail we only have to have any of them happen and our crack record doesn't look good

917
01:38:32,600 --> 01:38:40,680
right if you look back at the history of empires at all the history of war and environmental

918
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:46,360
destruction is a pretty big part of that story we don't seem to be really noble stewards of power

919
01:38:46,360 --> 01:38:50,120
so as we're getting exponentially more power and we've usually used our power to

920
01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:57,160
do power games with each other meaning destroy each other and in ways that harm the environment

921
01:38:57,160 --> 01:39:03,080
is there any way that we can steward exponential power in a finite space I would say it takes a

922
01:39:03,080 --> 01:39:12,360
step function like it will take something significant that is more than just the continuation of

923
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:15,560
whatever good aspects the enlightenment created or something like that

924
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:23,800
in the huge shift after world war two it was a big shift we made a whole new world system

925
01:39:24,440 --> 01:39:25,720
but the answer was still

926
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:33,080
extract more from nature even faster make more money and make more tech like it the

927
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:39,960
Bretton Woods world system was a world system but in more increase for everybody was still a

928
01:39:39,960 --> 01:39:43,000
somewhat easier thing to do than when you're hitting planetary boundaries and you have to say

929
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:46,760
no we actually have to reduce consumption across everybody where a lot of people are like no I

930
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:51,640
would rather not reduce my consumption go to war and have less people and I think I can win like

931
01:39:51,640 --> 01:39:57,000
this it's hard the situation we're in right now is unprecedented at a global level in such deep ways

932
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:06,200
right so do I think it is possible to make it through I think the question is it possible to

933
01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:11,320
make it through without great harm doesn't even make sense because we're in species extinction

934
01:40:11,320 --> 01:40:16,520
and war today like great harm is happening today people are being killed in Ukraine people are

935
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:20,840
being killed in Armenia and Azerbaijan people are being killed all over because of these issues

936
01:40:21,880 --> 01:40:30,440
and species are going extinct today so we're already in the great harm phase I almost know

937
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:36,520
adolescents don't have body dysmorphia in the Instagram etc world like that's

938
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:44,040
so we're already in that right now do I think we can make it through without catastrophes

939
01:40:44,040 --> 01:40:49,880
where hundreds of millions of people die is one question do I think we can make it through where

940
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:54,200
there are any humans left I think we make it through where there are humans and something

941
01:40:54,200 --> 01:41:00,920
that isn't just a totally scorched earth these are all different questions the answer

942
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:08,680
can we make it through without the catastrophes intensifying no no no chance so so

943
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:15,800
so given all this the the question comes up how then should we live given the truth of

944
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:22,200
well this next part is critical can we make it through without the catastrophes intensifying

945
01:41:22,200 --> 01:41:27,800
no they're going to intensify because no matter what we do today there is no inactable path

946
01:41:29,080 --> 01:41:35,320
to preventing the extreme weather events that climate change alone is going to mediate there's

947
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:40,040
a lot of things like that and then the human migration that's going to come from that we can

948
01:41:40,040 --> 01:41:46,840
if we do the very best things we can make it less bad but there is also no we there is no we that

949
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:54,200
is a unified acting group right um the what china's interests are and what the us's interests are

950
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:59,320
what the individual with the left and right within the us's interests are what the individual us people

951
01:41:59,320 --> 01:42:05,560
versus the elites in it they're not the same and so the whole like one of the biggest mistakes I made

952
01:42:05,560 --> 01:42:12,600
growing up was I always thought in this royal we that like humanity thoughtfully was all reading

953
01:42:12,600 --> 01:42:17,480
bucky's operating manual for spaceship earth and we're all you know thinking about un charters and

954
01:42:17,480 --> 01:42:21,640
looking at the earth and the astronauts perspective and carrying carl sagan's pale blue dot and of

955
01:42:21,640 --> 01:42:29,320
course we want to do the right and smart and good thing for everybody uh the thing that some people

956
01:42:29,320 --> 01:42:34,920
think is really good the other people think is really horrible and when you realize that

957
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:43,880
the enactment gets really hard right is is the legality of abortion protecting women's freedoms

958
01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:52,840
and rights or is it murdering infants um you'll see the most severe uh ideological differences

959
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:58,040
on what is good they create a basis for massive conflict and you see that across so many things

960
01:42:58,760 --> 01:43:07,320
right so um that's why I said there isn't a human family to hang together like that's

961
01:43:07,320 --> 01:43:15,960
that's an aspirational thing um do I think that if there is already a trajectory of some people who

962
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:21,080
care about not just their own political party or their own nation or their own race or even

963
01:43:21,080 --> 01:43:25,560
their own species but care pretty considerably and are working in service of that that there are

964
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:29,960
increasing number of people who have both more care more capacity and more interconnectivity

965
01:43:30,600 --> 01:43:34,280
and they cannot then also work with other people who maybe don't care about all of that but in

966
01:43:34,280 --> 01:43:38,840
increasingly good coordination for the things they do care about yes that's happening right

967
01:43:38,840 --> 01:43:45,960
there's a good thing in emergence that is happening do I think that that could be sufficient

968
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:54,200
to make it through without total extinction or scorched earth yes totally do I think it

969
01:43:54,200 --> 01:44:00,120
can make it through without the catastrophes intensifying no they will intensify before even

970
01:44:00,120 --> 01:44:08,440
on the best course do I think that it's a given that we make it through no which means we are no

971
01:44:08,440 --> 01:44:14,120
matter what in a phase of increasing intensity ahead and with I think both the what it takes to

972
01:44:14,120 --> 01:44:18,600
avoid all the catastrophes is deep enough change to the world systems that it's like that Bohmian

973
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:24,120
thing that we are neither harming each other on purpose or accident which means a kind of

974
01:44:24,120 --> 01:44:29,000
more universal on the consideration or things like a human family is actually a real thing

975
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:37,240
so I think in order to not have a get much worse changes have to happen at a deep enough

976
01:44:37,240 --> 01:44:41,320
level that it gets much better so I do think there's something like a pretty hard fork

977
01:44:42,680 --> 01:44:49,480
and I think it can go either way and I think it is not determined and I think it is increasingly

978
01:44:49,480 --> 01:44:55,480
potent and hard over the next while on in figuring that out so with that then the question how do

979
01:44:55,480 --> 01:45:05,320
we live as the frame is I can't imagine a context in which one's choices could matter more

980
01:45:05,320 --> 01:45:09,160
than that

981
01:45:15,960 --> 01:45:23,320
indeed it gives a whole another level and depth and dimension to

982
01:45:25,640 --> 01:45:31,000
the choices we make and the priorities we serve and the

983
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:39,320
how we live our lives and offer our lives and so what what are some of the parameters for an

984
01:45:39,320 --> 01:45:42,840
effective contributing life that you see

985
01:45:43,000 --> 01:46:01,960
a few more resources that I'll offer here another short little blog I wrote on how to live a meaningful life

986
01:46:03,640 --> 01:46:08,600
which was intentionally not answering the question what is the meaning of life which we discussed

987
01:46:08,680 --> 01:46:13,480
earlier but it said had a meaningful life and it's just

988
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:19,720
it's a way of talking about it there's lots of ways of talking about it that's not particularly

989
01:46:19,720 --> 01:46:26,360
better than lots of other ways but I there's something that is kind of comprehensive and

990
01:46:26,360 --> 01:46:33,800
kind of elegant about it so I'll offer it and it was looking at the mode of being

991
01:46:34,760 --> 01:46:41,000
the mode of doing and the mode of becoming all being relevant and defining all of them in terms

992
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:45,960
of beauty and that thing we said earlier that truth and goodness matter because beauty is

993
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:55,400
so there it says the mode of being at its essence is about really deeply taking in the beauty of

994
01:46:55,400 --> 01:47:01,880
reality and appreciating it giving gratitude for it honoring and loving it you know all those things

995
01:47:02,840 --> 01:47:05,400
it's the essence of what the mode of being is really about

996
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:13,400
and that the mode of doing is about being in service to the beauty of reality protecting

997
01:47:13,400 --> 01:47:20,040
it adding to it and the mode of becoming is deepening the capacity for being in doing

998
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:27,720
that I can appreciate ever more fully and that I can add to it ever more fully

999
01:47:27,960 --> 01:47:32,760
and that a meaningful life is a recursive relationship between those three

1000
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:40,120
and if what I'm doing isn't arising out of everything's fucked up so I have to fix everything

1001
01:47:40,120 --> 01:47:45,800
but it's arising out of perceiving working on this hunger issue because we're perceiving the

1002
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:50,680
utter meaningfulness and beauty of these kids or these people in their life and the importance of

1003
01:47:50,680 --> 01:47:57,560
it and the and so then the doing the desire to serve and protect arises not from the perception

1004
01:47:57,560 --> 01:48:02,920
of all the badness but actually arises from the perception of the beauty from which the good

1005
01:48:02,920 --> 01:48:08,600
which also means the bad is framed at all right so the thing that really is terrible and pisses us

1006
01:48:08,600 --> 01:48:14,520
off is because something that is beautiful and sacred is being harmed which then brings us back

1007
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:19,400
to there's something that we actually love and have devotion to so we trace it back to that and say

1008
01:48:19,480 --> 01:48:23,720
how do I be in service there so the doing must arise from the being

1009
01:48:25,560 --> 01:48:31,720
and the becoming is I don't just want to perceive the beauty I currently see I want to perceive

1010
01:48:32,920 --> 01:48:39,320
ever deeper dimensions of things that I had missed you know I want to ask what aspects of the

1011
01:48:39,320 --> 01:48:44,520
of reality are important and beautiful that I'm missing that other people are noticing that I'm

1012
01:48:44,600 --> 01:48:51,720
not honoring as fully as I could and then similarly with our doing where do I have frameworks for what

1013
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:57,400
I'm where is what I'm doing coming from ego and trauma and wounding where have I been running a

1014
01:48:57,400 --> 01:49:02,120
strategy so long if I stopped and thought about it from scratch and I come up with something better

1015
01:49:02,120 --> 01:49:12,120
you know like I want to be deepening the doing as well so I think if one relates to appreciating

1016
01:49:12,120 --> 01:49:16,680
the beauty of life adding to it deepening the capacity for both that's a nice framework to start

1017
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:24,200
and then there was another resource but on there called Dharma inquiry which is more personal

1018
01:49:24,200 --> 01:49:29,560
because that's obviously true for everybody the Dharma inquiry it's more into specific

1019
01:49:30,200 --> 01:49:37,320
things one is bothered by and is inspired by and has aptitude at and is called to to have a sense of

1020
01:49:38,200 --> 01:49:44,920
what is your unique relationship to that is your own Dharma with it I realized that

1021
01:49:46,680 --> 01:49:50,920
there's something both very beautiful about the kind of bodhisattva direction and something

1022
01:49:50,920 --> 01:49:57,640
that is incomplete about a certain direction of it I was I was incredibly influenced by

1023
01:49:58,600 --> 01:50:03,560
the value of the bodhisattva and the may I become whatever is needed and

1024
01:50:05,560 --> 01:50:11,400
when you look around and try to perceive what is needed and try to develop within yourself

1025
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:18,360
what can offer something there I remember the the first time I actually read it was in Alex Gray's

1026
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:24,920
art book the sacred mirrors and he had the heavy look page for the painting and then he had this

1027
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:29,240
poem next to it it's so beautiful and it said something like where there is

1028
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:37,960
thirst may rain fall upon the people and may I myself become that rain or there is hunger may

1029
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:41,560
I be transformed into the food but near them where there is illness may I become the medicine

1030
01:50:41,560 --> 01:50:50,200
you know wherever there is need of any kind may I become what is needed I think that helps one to

1031
01:50:50,280 --> 01:50:55,080
recognize that what they love is deeper to who they are than who they think they are

1032
01:50:56,440 --> 01:51:01,560
beautiful because I think I like these things and I don't like these things I'm good at these

1033
01:51:01,560 --> 01:51:08,280
things not these things but oh I can't help with that because I'm not a legal scholar or I'm not

1034
01:51:08,280 --> 01:51:12,520
a construction worker or I'm not a whatever it is and yeah it's like but if that's the thing

1035
01:51:12,520 --> 01:51:18,600
that is most needed and would help what you care about most can you can you become something that

1036
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:23,800
you are not and I've had many times where there was something that I was not good at that I actually

1037
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:29,080
really identified as a thing I would never want to be good at and realized that it actually

1038
01:51:29,080 --> 01:51:33,560
mattered what I cared about enough that if I held that limited identity I was not in maximum

1039
01:51:33,560 --> 01:51:39,080
service to what I claimed to care about and I had to get like well I I care about what I care about

1040
01:51:39,080 --> 01:51:46,040
so long as it fits with my identity easily or I've got to transcend the identity so that's

1041
01:51:46,040 --> 01:51:50,840
what I like about the vow of the bodhisattva but where it's missing something is

1042
01:51:53,480 --> 01:51:59,480
I really am not equally good at all the things that are needed nor can I do all of the things

1043
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:07,640
even if I try there's a lot of people have to do all the things so if medicine work is needed and if

1044
01:52:07,640 --> 01:52:12,360
economics change is needed and if care of the individual people and animals is needed as well

1045
01:52:12,360 --> 01:52:20,120
as macro systemic thinking about systems to do that not only what is most needed but what is most

1046
01:52:20,120 --> 01:52:27,480
needed that my being is well developed to be able to be in service to is important and so the

1047
01:52:27,480 --> 01:52:34,680
Dharma questions are trying to help hone that for people. Beautiful and and you're pointing to

1048
01:52:35,560 --> 01:52:42,200
the kinds of questions we need to ask ourselves in order to in order to orient ourselves

1049
01:52:42,200 --> 01:52:48,200
to be most effective instruments of service or for the and in the bodhisattva aspiration for

1050
01:52:48,200 --> 01:52:54,280
the welfare and awakening of all and I really think that probably that bodhisattva aspiration

1051
01:52:54,280 --> 01:53:00,840
may be one of the highest ideals in mind as human mind has ever come up with and such a beautiful

1052
01:53:00,840 --> 01:53:05,800
thing and you're pointing now to the questions we ask which the first question that emerges is

1053
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:11,640
well what what can I do but then you're pointing to the idea that there's a there are questions

1054
01:53:11,640 --> 01:53:20,200
deeper than that what's the most effective thing I can do and along with that the question or the

1055
01:53:20,200 --> 01:53:29,720
colon actually what am I called to do and deeper still in your implication is is a question how

1056
01:53:29,720 --> 01:53:36,440
can I live my life so as to be an optimal instrument of service and each of those is I think better

1057
01:53:36,440 --> 01:53:43,000
thought of as a as a colon or a wisdom question and I would draw the distinction saying a conceptual

1058
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:48,600
question is you know is it raining outside take a look no end of question but wisdom questions are

1059
01:53:48,600 --> 01:53:52,200
more like columns every time you ask them they have the potential for taking you deeper into the

1060
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:58,520
question deeper into life deeper into yourself and so you're pointing us towards the real the

1061
01:53:58,520 --> 01:54:04,680
wisdom questions of our time. I would also say that almost every value or principle

1062
01:54:06,520 --> 01:54:14,040
lives in a dialectical relationship with another value or principle that is complementary but

1063
01:54:14,040 --> 01:54:21,320
they might seem almost opposite and that without holding them together the full version of just

1064
01:54:21,320 --> 01:54:28,600
that one thing the reducto ad absurdum of it actually becomes evil and so this is the everything

1065
01:54:28,680 --> 01:54:38,280
can be a medicine or everything can be a poison topic so what is

1066
01:54:41,240 --> 01:54:48,120
what is my unique self calling what is that which I can offer the world based on the unique

1067
01:54:48,120 --> 01:54:54,360
set of experiences and capacities I have that no one else could offer that if I spend my life doing

1068
01:54:54,360 --> 01:55:00,440
things other than that that other people could do the most novel offering that I have doesn't occur

1069
01:55:01,640 --> 01:55:06,040
that's a deep and important and beautiful question but taken to its extreme it'll make

1070
01:55:06,040 --> 01:55:11,560
you a total shithead because fucking do the dishes when you need to do the dishes no it's not your

1071
01:55:11,560 --> 01:55:16,360
unique self the only thing that you can do like anybody can do the dishes or take out the trash

1072
01:55:16,360 --> 01:55:23,640
but like damn though a lot of life is just doing the dishes out of the trash and maybe the unique

1073
01:55:23,640 --> 01:55:31,720
self that you have is is unexpressible infinitesimal qualities with which you show up to those things

1074
01:55:31,720 --> 01:55:41,720
you know so the what is uniquely mine to do that no one else can do and what fucking needs done

1075
01:55:41,720 --> 01:55:46,600
that nobody wants to do I'll just show up to you got to hold those together right because also on

1076
01:55:46,600 --> 01:55:50,920
the other side if you always just say what is nobody what is the shittiest job that nobody

1077
01:55:50,920 --> 01:55:55,640
wants to do let me show up to that which is an incredibly ennobling question incredibly beautiful

1078
01:55:55,640 --> 01:56:06,520
question you can also end up uh failing at some unique self darmism capacities you could have

1079
01:56:06,520 --> 01:56:17,720
because of only orienting that way and so uh every every principle and every virtue needs held in a

1080
01:56:17,720 --> 01:56:24,120
dialectical relationship and not over normed as absolute yeah and this is the ancient concept

1081
01:56:24,120 --> 01:56:31,880
of the interdependence of virtues that that they require require each other and complement one

1082
01:56:31,880 --> 01:56:37,560
one another and I think you're also pointing to the contextual nature of our inquiries that we

1083
01:56:37,560 --> 01:56:46,360
have to keep the context as well so again beautiful beautiful reflections and deepening and expanding

1084
01:56:46,680 --> 01:56:52,520
uh that I see you're pointing us to yeah and I've I've just felt that we've been spending

1085
01:56:53,400 --> 01:56:57,800
I don't know extra amount of time in the heart of philosophy and I feel a connection with

1086
01:56:57,800 --> 01:57:03,800
fidgety triathlons and all of that stuff has started long ago in another land and it's still

1087
01:57:04,760 --> 01:57:14,040
it's still churning and a universe that can produce um a you and a me I can't be all bad

1088
01:57:14,040 --> 01:57:24,200
and I feel deeply moved and deeply uh renewed in my commitment to do my little things you know

1089
01:57:24,200 --> 01:57:29,720
whatever that calling might be and I think I pretty much found that but also to shampoo my dog

1090
01:57:29,720 --> 01:57:36,200
and take out the trash and you know wipe the counters and that sort of thing you know and

1091
01:57:36,200 --> 01:57:41,160
you say it can't be all bad it's funny because so I focus on the meta crisis which is like all the

1092
01:57:41,160 --> 01:57:45,800
most fucked up stuff that could be all together um it kind of seems like that but it's not really

1093
01:57:45,800 --> 01:58:01,000
what I focus on I mean it's in appreciation and love of this world and life there's the desire to

1094
01:58:02,200 --> 01:58:07,880
protect it and uh so paying attention to things that need protecting but where does the motivation

1095
01:58:07,960 --> 01:58:11,720
come from the motivation doesn't come things being fucked up the motivation comes from the

1096
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:21,560
wonder of it right from the beauty of it like I've had I know you you both talk about bringing

1097
01:58:21,560 --> 01:58:28,040
the philosophic concepts into daily practice on this um show a lot and you know I've had a lot of

1098
01:58:28,040 --> 01:58:33,880
practices throughout my life in terms of types of meditation types of inquiry and whatever

1099
01:58:34,840 --> 01:58:40,920
but like I wake up in the morning and the first thing I do pretty much every morning is I just

1100
01:58:40,920 --> 01:58:45,400
look out the window at the trees and I just watch the trees move in the wind for a little bit

1101
01:58:46,760 --> 01:58:54,440
and I don't I don't have to try to care about them or try to find them beautiful they're just

1102
01:58:54,440 --> 01:58:59,400
fucking beautiful and there's a happiness that comes just watching that and then there's a

1103
01:58:59,400 --> 01:59:04,440
gratitude to be alive and consciousness you know arising again and there's a happiness to be on this

1104
01:59:04,440 --> 01:59:10,760
planet and then there is a because of the happiness it comes from just the perception of the beauty

1105
01:59:10,760 --> 01:59:15,640
of it I don't need that much for myself right there's not an unhappiness it needs me to do a

1106
01:59:15,640 --> 01:59:22,520
bunch of stuff and then there's this gratitude that I like I was sleeping this con this Daniel

1107
01:59:22,520 --> 01:59:27,640
consciousness wasn't here and then it boots again and now it's here and I think about when Daniel's

1108
01:59:27,640 --> 01:59:35,080
dead the consciousness that will be perceiving the world and falling in love for the first time and

1109
01:59:35,080 --> 01:59:40,440
climbing trees and reading hafez and rumi for the first time it's all the things and I can't

1110
01:59:40,440 --> 01:59:45,480
not feel connected to those consciousnesses a hundred and a thousand years from it like I can't

1111
01:59:45,480 --> 01:59:51,560
not feel what it feels like to perceive through those eyes and I'm actually not trying to get it

1112
01:59:51,560 --> 01:59:59,160
to go anywhere I just want that kids get to keep experiencing falling in love with trees for the

1113
01:59:59,160 --> 02:00:02,920
first time and mothers get to keep falling in love with their kids and people get to fall in love and do

1114
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:10,360
poetry for the first time and get heartbroken and all the things the pot like it is intrinsically

1115
02:00:10,360 --> 02:00:18,040
already meaningful without going anywhere and it's already beautiful and you know one of the other

1116
02:00:18,040 --> 02:00:22,280
things I know you'll have talked about is peak experiences and one of the things I always felt is

1117
02:00:24,920 --> 02:00:26,520
once you have had one of them

1118
02:00:31,160 --> 02:00:37,640
like for me I remember I remember discreetly I've talked about before there was this one time I

1119
02:00:37,640 --> 02:00:44,200
was watching a sunset and writing poetry to nature and watching a sunset as a teenager

1120
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:49,960
and I remember the sunset was just so incredibly beautiful and I remember thinking

1121
02:00:51,480 --> 02:00:56,040
if I had the choice if there is a spirit before this life if I had the choice to come here and

1122
02:00:56,040 --> 02:00:59,800
incarnate and go through whatever painful things that I've went through my whole life just to get

1123
02:00:59,800 --> 02:01:07,480
to have this one experience of color and vision and the wind and the insects in this moment would

1124
02:01:07,480 --> 02:01:12,600
totally do it like I would take every pain in my whole life to have had this experience as opposed to

1125
02:01:12,600 --> 02:01:20,920
no experience and then I'm like I've had that I've had so many of these experiences and one of

1126
02:01:20,920 --> 02:01:27,640
them is worth incarnating for I've had so many of them and so it's like the fact that I will probably

1127
02:01:27,640 --> 02:01:34,440
have more of them is gravy and it's like a ridiculous beauty and abundance but that every

1128
02:01:34,440 --> 02:01:38,360
that future life gets to keep having those and that other people get to have more of those is kind

1129
02:01:38,360 --> 02:01:46,200
of more what I'm motivated by and they make us better persons when we experience those things

1130
02:01:46,200 --> 02:01:53,720
that it shifts you know something happens maybe just a little bit but something happens in a

1131
02:01:53,720 --> 02:01:59,000
positive thing and shifts in our soul and our interiors and maybe we behave a little a little

1132
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:04,200
better or a lot better I'm not sure I think the what's in it for me thing chills out

1133
02:02:04,200 --> 02:02:10,760
you know and it's not that it doesn't reboot because we're complex people with lots of parts

1134
02:02:10,760 --> 02:02:15,640
and there will be a pain body that reboots and so it's not like enlightenment is a static thing

1135
02:02:15,640 --> 02:02:20,920
and you have a satori and then you never have a pain body boot again it does but there's something

1136
02:02:20,920 --> 02:02:29,080
about even just thinking about it and just being like I there could have been no I no experience at

1137
02:02:29,080 --> 02:02:35,720
all and there's experience and there've been such amazing ones and

1138
02:02:39,880 --> 02:02:44,840
and and I feel this pretty much with every difficulty or trauma too is like when you've

1139
02:02:44,840 --> 02:02:50,440
done the healing work with it you don't still feel messed up by the trauma or the pain but you do feel

1140
02:02:51,240 --> 02:02:58,760
ongoingly benefited by the lessons and it's kind of like a lot of people don't have the

1141
02:02:58,760 --> 02:03:02,520
resources or know how to do the healing so they never get the lessons and they're just always

1142
02:03:02,520 --> 02:03:07,400
affected by the pain and that's a bummer but if one kind of has the resources knows how to work

1143
02:03:07,400 --> 02:03:13,080
on it then the pain is temporary and the gifts are lasting and it's like this just beneficial

1144
02:03:13,080 --> 02:03:18,760
asymmetry like this beautiful asymmetry where it's like yeah I just am a yes to the whole thing

1145
02:03:18,760 --> 02:03:26,120
let's say yes to the whole thing and there's there's a beautiful couple of lines that came out of

1146
02:03:26,120 --> 02:03:33,160
San Quentin prison uh there's a project uh grip guiding rage into pain which uh the people work

1147
02:03:33,160 --> 02:03:39,240
very intensely with with people many of them life as many of them have been murderers and

1148
02:03:40,040 --> 02:03:44,920
work on life transformation their ideals the body sight for aspiration the commitment is

1149
02:03:45,480 --> 02:03:50,840
even if I stay in my in the prison for the rest of my life I'm going to do what I can to help people

1150
02:03:51,640 --> 02:03:58,840
and one and one of them after after and there's a very intensive exploration of their pain and

1151
02:03:58,840 --> 02:04:04,920
the trauma they've both caused and received and these are very traumatized people and there's a

1152
02:04:04,920 --> 02:04:11,320
video of one of these sessions in which one of the one of the prisoners some suddenly lights out

1153
02:04:11,320 --> 02:04:17,720
lights up and says oh I get it hurt people hurt people and healed people heal people

1154
02:04:18,600 --> 02:04:25,960
it's like oh oh it's so beautiful yeah they're both self-propagating

1155
02:04:27,480 --> 02:04:36,200
yeah I would love to explore that with you Daniel uh we've gone long and far and deep or maybe that's

1156
02:04:36,200 --> 02:04:41,720
the wrong word uh to explore the the darkness and the addiction and the way out of that and just

1157
02:04:41,720 --> 02:04:48,440
what you said um Roger uh hurt people hurt people and heal people heal people and that's uh

1158
02:04:49,480 --> 02:04:56,360
maybe that's a good place to wrap it uh for this evening I really enjoyed the conversation with

1159
02:04:56,360 --> 02:05:02,600
both of you I think that the this podcast where you're exploring these topics and sharing it with

1160
02:05:02,600 --> 02:05:10,680
people is uh a really beautiful service and I'm honored to be here with you oh it's such a delight

1161
02:05:10,680 --> 02:05:17,400
Daniel and it's such a such a gift to be able to investigate at this depth and co-explore so

1162
02:05:18,040 --> 02:05:25,080
thank you so much for this gift to to everyone who listens to the podcast and thank you so much

1163
02:05:25,080 --> 02:05:30,520
for your life's work it's truly a gift crisis we get to share this with thousands and thousands

1164
02:05:30,520 --> 02:05:35,480
of god knows how many people that's tremendous that's just tremendous if there is a second time

1165
02:05:35,480 --> 02:05:42,280
we come back to and explore that hurt people hurt people that there is some

1166
02:05:43,720 --> 02:05:50,200
autopoetic trauma force almost and that there is also some kind of autopoetic healing or integrative

1167
