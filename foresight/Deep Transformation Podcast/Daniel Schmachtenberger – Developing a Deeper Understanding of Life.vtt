Welcome to Deep Transformation, Self-Society Spirit.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.600
I'm Roger Walsh, and our co-host is John DePuy.

00:17.600 --> 00:23.160
And with us today is a guest that I'm just delighted to be in dialogue with.

00:23.160 --> 00:29.960
This is Daniel Schmacktenberger, one of the most incisive, integrative, and brilliant

00:29.960 --> 00:32.880
thinkers about the great issues of our time.

00:32.880 --> 00:39.560
Daniel's a polymath who has ranged across a wide variety of disciplines and has a prodigious

00:39.560 --> 00:47.360
amount of information about multiple areas, topics, issues, concerns, and intellectual

00:47.360 --> 00:54.440
disciplines, but not only a wide array of information, a remarkable degree of information

00:54.440 --> 01:00.840
and integration, pulling topics together, synthesizing them in novel ways, and coming

01:00.840 --> 01:07.760
up with creative innovations and ideas and synthesis.

01:07.760 --> 01:15.640
He is able to and has been giving us a wide array of insights into the great issues of

01:15.640 --> 01:16.640
our time.

01:16.640 --> 01:22.120
And if you've searched the internet, you've probably run across Daniel and the many dialogues

01:22.120 --> 01:28.160
he's had about the metacrisis, the term that's currently used for some total of our social

01:28.160 --> 01:30.520
and global issues.

01:30.520 --> 01:38.240
But what you haven't seen or heard of, Daniel, is his spiritual dimensions and the ways in

01:38.240 --> 01:44.840
which those have touched his understanding of life and our current temporary concerns.

01:44.840 --> 01:50.600
So we were really delighted, given that Deep Transformation is about transformation not

01:50.640 --> 01:56.840
only of self and society, but also of spirit, when Daniel suggested that in our discussion

01:56.840 --> 02:01.480
of the metacrisis, we focused specifically on the spiritual dimensions, which he said

02:01.480 --> 02:04.120
he doesn't often get a chance to talk about.

02:04.120 --> 02:08.720
And so we are just very happy to have this opportunity.

02:08.720 --> 02:15.200
Daniel, so many people know you as someone, as a brilliant intellectual who has thought

02:15.200 --> 02:22.280
deep and hard and synthetically and novelly about these great issues.

02:22.280 --> 02:27.320
But you also have a deep commitment to self exploration, self actualization, spiritual

02:27.320 --> 02:29.520
practice.

02:29.520 --> 02:36.480
What would you like to share about that side of yourself?

02:37.480 --> 02:47.240
First, thanks for having me here, it's good to be with you both and all the people engaging

02:47.240 --> 02:51.200
in the podcast.

02:51.200 --> 02:59.040
When it comes to the spiritual dimensions, and we'll probably want to unpack what we

02:59.040 --> 03:05.440
even mean by spiritual sense, it is a pretty unprecise term often.

03:05.440 --> 03:16.880
But the psychological, interior, sacred, whatever dimensions of the state of our world, I would

03:16.880 --> 03:18.880
love to be in that conversation together.

03:18.880 --> 03:23.080
I don't have a preset set of things to talk about on it, because as you mentioned, it's

03:23.080 --> 03:33.680
not the thing I talk about all the time, but obviously very interesting.

03:33.680 --> 03:38.600
I was fortunate in my growing up to get to study a lot of the people that might be called

03:38.600 --> 03:44.480
great polymaths throughout history, so I have a heap of respect for them and I've tried

03:44.480 --> 03:51.600
to learn what I can, I would not describe myself that way.

03:51.600 --> 03:57.440
I think the connection is I would describe myself as being deeply interested in lots of

03:57.440 --> 04:06.200
things, and I find that what people are interested in and what they find meaningful, and at the

04:06.200 --> 04:09.800
heart of that what they find sacred are usually connected, though they might not be explicitly

04:09.800 --> 04:16.520
aware, and the things that people are interested in and enough, they often develop some capacity

04:16.640 --> 04:28.200
at, and if someone has some sense of the wholeness of reality, as opposed to when we think in

04:28.200 --> 04:37.080
different disciplines, here's where biology starts and chemistry stops or physics or whatever,

04:37.080 --> 04:40.640
those are ways we take the complexity of the world and try to divide it to make subjects

04:40.640 --> 04:45.800
and make it easier to study, but those divisions don't exist in reality in that way.

04:46.080 --> 04:52.720
So if we have some sense of just the integrated wholeness of reality and we're kind of interested in it,

04:52.720 --> 04:58.720
there's some sense that reality itself is sacred, then there would be nothing that isn't interesting.

04:58.720 --> 05:06.720
It's like, if you're really in love with your partner, what aspect of their being is uninteresting to you?

05:06.720 --> 05:11.640
It's a weird proposition to say, oh, I don't give a shit what she thinks about, or her

05:11.720 --> 05:17.960
talk books on fashion or whatever it is, and it's such a superficial place to be, because even if you

05:17.960 --> 05:22.520
didn't think you cared about that topic on your own, if you really care about this being and this

05:22.520 --> 05:26.920
being cares about it, work to understand why they care about it, because there's some part of their

05:26.920 --> 05:32.840
being you're missing, if the fascination they have, if the care, if the love doesn't translate to,

05:34.360 --> 05:40.760
and so if you get that, you're like, well, whatever, every aspect of them I'm interested in,

05:40.760 --> 05:45.000
because part of love is the desire to know, because what does it mean that I love somebody if I don't

05:45.000 --> 05:53.880
really know who they are? And if I have some love for reality, then wanting to know it more is

05:53.880 --> 05:58.680
one of the things, right, wanting to appreciate it more wanting to be in more service to it,

05:58.680 --> 06:05.720
and those are all just kind of natural byproducts. And so relatively young,

06:06.680 --> 06:15.000
I had the insight that everything was interesting, that the things that I thought weren't interesting,

06:15.000 --> 06:19.400
because at first I didn't think that, but the things I thought weren't interesting was just

06:19.400 --> 06:27.000
because I didn't get them, I didn't understand why anyone else found it interesting, and if I

06:27.000 --> 06:30.280
tuned in empathetically enough to them, and I could see it, I'm like, oh, there's a whole

06:30.280 --> 06:34.840
dimension of meaningfulness and beauty and parts of the nature of reality that I'm just missing,

06:34.920 --> 06:44.920
and when Gibran said it's in, it was in meditation upon the dew drop that I discovered the mysteries

06:44.920 --> 06:50.520
of the ocean, right, the kind of poetic way to speak to the fractal nature or the as without so

06:50.520 --> 06:57.160
within, when there is some understanding of the integratedness of reality, a deep insight about

06:57.160 --> 07:03.240
anything also gives you some insight about everything else. And one of the places that I

07:03.480 --> 07:09.640
most insight was taking some principle in thermodynamics and applying it to gardening,

07:09.640 --> 07:14.680
or some principle in evolutionary theory and applying it to relationships or whatever,

07:14.680 --> 07:19.720
getting that like those theories were ways of understanding the universe, but all of them

07:19.720 --> 07:23.720
gave different insights, looking at the world through a thermodynamics lens versus an evolutionary

07:23.720 --> 07:28.520
psych lens versus a complexity theory lens gave different insights on the same reality.

07:29.400 --> 07:32.840
So if I could take those insights and apply them to lots of things and apply lots of different

07:32.840 --> 07:37.560
ones, just got to see more multi-dimensionally. I mean, one of the projects we launched called

07:37.560 --> 07:41.320
the conciliance project, and that's what the word conciliance means is the more

07:42.200 --> 07:47.560
perspectives one can take on the thing, the more depth and richness of information they can get

07:47.560 --> 07:55.240
about it. So, and I think, you know, the the metacrisis, this area of study of like,

07:56.200 --> 08:02.120
what are all the problems of the world is really like came from a childhood inquiry of

08:04.200 --> 08:10.360
what is worth doing. And there were so many things that were worth doing. And I became

08:11.400 --> 08:17.080
kind of clear that when you focus on one, one, I just couldn't leave some of the areas out,

08:17.960 --> 08:23.320
right? Like, it was just, I don't know how many people have this experience, some for sure.

08:24.280 --> 08:28.200
But when I would think about really focusing on factory farms or really focusing on

08:30.920 --> 08:35.080
the issue of how many dogs and cats are getting put to sleep every year or clear cutting or whatever

08:35.080 --> 08:42.200
it was, the idea that I was not focusing on the other things just wrecked me. And then getting

08:42.200 --> 08:46.680
to see that there were so many groups focusing on those things, and yet so many of those things

08:46.680 --> 08:50.760
collectively were getting worse, not better. And I was wondering, do we just need more effort in

08:50.760 --> 08:55.800
these areas? Or is there something about the nature of the effort that is that is off?

08:57.080 --> 09:01.160
And the answer is both. But there was definitely something about, and people have heard me talk

09:01.160 --> 09:05.640
other places, the way we solve problems causes other problems almost all the time, because we

09:05.640 --> 09:09.960
define the problem too narrowly, we create a first order solution that the technology or a law or

09:09.960 --> 09:14.920
business or whatever to solve it. But that's connected to a complex set of things, and it

09:14.920 --> 09:19.800
produces second and third order effects somewhere else. So the dam to bring electricity to poor

09:19.800 --> 09:24.120
people to solve the poverty issue might extinct a bunch of species downriver from the dam that

09:24.120 --> 09:33.000
just got flooded or whatever in this, a million examples of this. So there's a, it actually became

09:33.000 --> 09:40.280
clear that the study of the issues in the world and the siloing of the issues in the world was

09:40.280 --> 09:45.240
a part of the problem itself, why we weren't solving them in a way that Bohm talked about very

09:45.240 --> 09:53.880
well, David Bohm. And so the, like what is worth caring about everything, you know, how it fits

09:53.880 --> 09:58.680
together, what is worth studying is kind of everything. The study is for itself, it's pure

09:58.680 --> 10:03.400
knowledge of just the intimacy with universes intrinsically interesting. And it's also has

10:03.400 --> 10:10.200
utility, it can increase the capacity to be of service to. Those are some initial thoughts.

10:11.160 --> 10:17.960
And Daniel, did you, was there a point as a young man or a teenager, you began as you were

10:17.960 --> 10:21.640
kind of chewing on all this and seeing it was that starting to emerge as a calling

10:22.200 --> 10:28.760
for you that maybe that was your path to start connecting the dots and seeing how these things

10:28.760 --> 10:32.200
mattered? I think

10:39.640 --> 10:45.880
I think most people when they're young are enculturated in a particular way about who they are

10:45.880 --> 10:51.640
and what life is about and what they should pursue. And then some of them continue on that path,

10:51.640 --> 10:57.320
some of them recognize that their parents idea of what they're calling should be or their culture's

10:57.320 --> 11:08.120
idea is not their own and then they have kind of this path change. I've had lots of path

11:08.120 --> 11:19.480
refinements. I have had times of deep study in esoteric metaphysics and hardcore reductionist

11:19.480 --> 11:24.120
atheism, you know, like any young person who's trying to be intellectually congruent and make

11:24.120 --> 11:30.040
sense of stuff and not miss stuff. But they had the same spirit to them, which is funny, right?

11:30.040 --> 11:34.040
They had the same spirit, which was like, and you can't even put words to it because you can

11:34.040 --> 11:38.200
say it's what is true, but it's also kind of what is good, what is meaningful, what is beautiful,

11:38.200 --> 11:48.120
and you know, something like that. But I think I was pretty fortunate in a way that some other,

11:48.120 --> 11:52.920
but not lots of other people were in terms of early childhood exposure to the topic of what is my

11:52.920 --> 12:00.920
path is that I had parents that were putting that question as the forefront of my education

12:00.920 --> 12:09.480
since I was born. And so that's a pretty fortunate thing. And I went to school a few times mostly

12:10.280 --> 12:14.680
my parents were interested in me getting some socialization, but I was mostly home school.

12:15.800 --> 12:22.120
And they were interested in running a kind of educational experiment. And they were not

12:22.120 --> 12:26.440
educational philosophers in any formally trained sense, they hadn't read Dewey and Montessori and

12:27.000 --> 12:31.960
Steiner, they just had their own kind of intuitions about it. But some really good intuitions.

12:32.840 --> 12:37.880
But the sense was rather than have a curriculum based thing have some sense of trust that the

12:39.800 --> 12:44.920
kids innate curiosities if facilitated will orient them in the right direction. So it's kind

12:44.920 --> 12:51.800
of constructivist. And so we had a homeschool that had no curriculum at all. And there are a few

12:51.800 --> 12:57.560
places where this was significantly disadvantageous because like it wasn't till I was an adult and

12:57.560 --> 13:03.320
paying attention to spell checker that I learned how to spell. It's very fortunate. I didn't do enough

13:03.320 --> 13:08.840
of the like writing letters penmanship to actually have refined the fine motor skills enough to have

13:08.840 --> 13:14.120
legible handwriting. I didn't get it and then let it devolve because of busyness like some doctors,

13:14.120 --> 13:20.840
I just never even got decent penmanship. It was a good thing I can type. There were whole areas of

13:20.920 --> 13:25.240
like American history and things that were actually important that I just didn't know were

13:25.240 --> 13:29.160
important and I just had none of them. But then there were some areas that I got to study way

13:29.160 --> 13:33.320
more deeply than people normally would have at those times. But because I was studying things

13:33.320 --> 13:38.200
I was interested in, I doubled down on interest, right? And I think one of the things that happens

13:38.200 --> 13:43.160
for a kid is when you don't facilitate their interests because you don't know how, which

13:43.160 --> 13:48.600
so often the kids are asking questions and the parents just don't know the answers. I give these

13:48.600 --> 13:55.320
examples a lot because they come up all the time when a kid asks why is the sky blue or why is fire

13:55.320 --> 14:02.920
hot. You have to understand many layers of physics but then also neuroscience and then also the

14:02.920 --> 14:08.840
philosophy of mind to be able to translate the subjective experience of hotness from sensations

14:08.840 --> 14:15.160
that happen on the skin and what is communicated between cells and in the nervous system to what

14:15.160 --> 14:20.520
is the thermodynamics of fire or the nature of the molecules in the upper atmosphere that create

14:20.520 --> 14:27.000
blueness in the visual optical spectrum. Those questions, if every kid asks stuff like that

14:27.000 --> 14:30.440
and if you know how to facilitate the interest, they end up learning everything from theory of

14:30.440 --> 14:39.400
mind to philosophy of science to, you know, atmospherics and neurobiology. But if you don't

14:39.400 --> 14:44.040
facilitate the things they're interested in and you force them to do shit that they're not interested

14:44.120 --> 14:49.320
in, it can break their interest and then they become a little bit more focused on quick hits of

14:50.040 --> 14:58.360
dopaminergic interest rather than deep learning. So I had that fortune but the other fortune other

14:58.360 --> 15:01.960
than just kind of just hiding my own curriculum is because a kid will largely be interested in

15:01.960 --> 15:06.600
things based on what they're exposed to and how they're exposed. I don't find that there are any

15:06.600 --> 15:11.880
kids who aren't interested in math who had amazing math teachers or who weren't interested in art who

15:11.880 --> 15:15.800
had amazing art teachers or history. So how they're exposed, what they're exposed to. And so

15:16.440 --> 15:20.600
what my parents were interested in had a lot to do with what I was interested in, of course,

15:20.600 --> 15:25.000
right? This is one of the limits of constructivism is, you know, what the reality of what the

15:25.000 --> 15:30.520
kid is exposed to. But again, I feel like I lucked out in terms of their interest being things were

15:31.560 --> 15:37.160
a pretty good set of things. So my, my parents were reading Buckminster Fuller and kind of design

15:37.160 --> 15:42.360
science and they were reading David Bowman, Krishnamurti, they were reading kind of Vedanta

15:42.360 --> 15:47.480
and Eastern philosophy for Choff Capra and the kind of emerging systems theory in the early 80s and

15:49.160 --> 15:54.360
and they also the thought that there's no reason bedtime kids bedtime stories for kids when their

15:54.360 --> 16:00.040
infants need to be Dr. Seuss as opposed to synergetics by Bucking Fuller because kids learning

16:00.040 --> 16:07.080
language no matter what. And so those were like my primitive concepts and included in those were

16:07.160 --> 16:12.920
the core existential questions of what are we, what are we here for? What is this all about?

16:12.920 --> 16:17.880
And then the people using kind of the most advanced frameworks of the time like systems theory and

16:17.880 --> 16:23.480
design science to think about how do we go about making a better world and like that. So I never

16:23.480 --> 16:31.720
really had to find my way to that. That was kind of the default setting. I had to find and upon

16:31.720 --> 16:34.760
further inquiry of like, was that a wrong default setting? Should I just

16:37.560 --> 16:42.360
just make money or make art or something else? Like no, that didn't, that ended up continuing to be

16:42.920 --> 16:51.960
roughly right direction, but trying to more competently answer how to understand the issues

16:51.960 --> 16:55.240
of the world and how to be of service to them. It's a lot of content refinement.

16:56.120 --> 17:05.400
Daniel, so you had an unusually broad self-directed education, but there's also

17:05.400 --> 17:11.480
something else that's quite distinctive about your thinking and that is a rare degree of integration.

17:12.280 --> 17:14.600
And how did you develop that?

17:14.920 --> 17:26.680
I have friends who are developmental theorists who, Zach Stein, who I work with closely and

17:26.680 --> 17:32.680
many others, who will talk about how there is an increase in the type of

17:35.560 --> 17:41.160
complexity of what someone can process, the way they notice changes in context for processing

17:41.240 --> 17:45.560
the same content the way they can seek and shift perspectives and then integrate them. And I think

17:45.560 --> 17:50.120
there's a lot true and important there. I have other friends who are critics of developmental

17:50.120 --> 17:56.440
theory because they say there's a lot of societal normative assumptions based on how people are

17:56.440 --> 18:00.440
kind of ubiquitously trained that in a different society with different childhood development

18:00.440 --> 18:11.720
would go differently. So for instance, if kids are being taught in school, this is math, this is

18:11.720 --> 18:16.600
social studies, this is history, this is biology, and they're being taught a compartmentalized

18:16.600 --> 18:20.840
universe where they're never asked how the social science is being influenced by the biology or

18:20.840 --> 18:26.280
vice versa or how the principles co-apply, they're getting a non-integrated fragmented world

18:26.520 --> 18:31.480
given to them and actually behaviorally trained up on thinking that way. They're not being given

18:31.480 --> 18:35.560
any kind of integrated framework, so then we get excited when someone becomes an integrative thinker

18:35.560 --> 18:42.120
later because it was trained out of everybody. I don't think it is actually necessary that people

18:42.120 --> 18:51.720
learn that way. I think it's not even the case in say, pre-industrialized education, it just wasn't

18:52.680 --> 19:01.560
even the case in the same way. And so because my education was self-directed, it also didn't have

19:01.560 --> 19:08.120
clear delineations of topics. I was never doing math or social studies. I was doing an inquiry

19:08.120 --> 19:11.960
about something that was interesting that might have involved some math and some, you know,

19:11.960 --> 19:19.320
quite a few things. So if you're trying to understand integrative things like how does a

19:19.320 --> 19:25.480
body self-organize? How does a fetus actually develop? How does that? Then you're having to

19:25.480 --> 19:32.520
intrinsically be radically interdisciplinary. What is worth doing in the world and how do we know?

19:33.800 --> 19:38.920
So I think the most interesting questions are at a high enough level of abstraction that to address

19:38.920 --> 19:44.680
them well, there's the taxonomy of questions beneath them is very interdisciplinary and you

19:44.680 --> 19:52.840
actually have to bridge across them. So I do think a totally different educational paradigm

19:52.840 --> 19:59.960
could have analysis and synthesis or integration on a knowledge that happening simultaneously

19:59.960 --> 20:08.840
at each level of complexity. Yeah. And pulling together some of the things you've said,

20:08.840 --> 20:15.960
you've spoken to your education, you've spoken to the natural integrative thinking that emerges

20:15.960 --> 20:23.640
from a problem-solving approach to education as opposed to a compartmentalized scholastic

20:23.640 --> 20:32.760
disciplinary approach. But also underlying this was sounds like a real desire for an

20:32.760 --> 20:40.200
appreciation of the whole and a desire to optimize service. And it seems like what I'm

20:40.200 --> 20:48.920
hearing is that those two things led you to this in big picture integrative approach to

20:48.920 --> 20:56.680
understanding and responding to the great issues of our time. Yeah, I'll share a few other things

20:56.680 --> 21:00.840
that I think were significant influences that I'm grateful for and that I think are interesting

21:00.840 --> 21:10.760
for everybody to look at is... I think there's a good bit of evidence that the

21:12.680 --> 21:17.800
people that many of us find to be some of the greatest exemplars of human potential

21:18.680 --> 21:23.720
were the result of developmental paths that are more accessible to everyone than lots of people

21:23.720 --> 21:35.000
or think. Not just some weird genetic or situational anomaly. And I'm not saying that genetics plays

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
no role in aptitude, of course it does. The height is a real thing that's going to affect

21:39.000 --> 21:45.880
aptitude, size, whatever, and maybe does it do that for neural connectivity? Sure. But

21:46.040 --> 21:57.480
I believe his name is Eric Hoel, who was an academic who started a very interesting blog recently,

21:59.160 --> 22:03.240
published this article that then has gotten a lot of traction and debate around where

22:03.240 --> 22:08.840
of all the super genius has gone. And it's a resource I think is really interesting and worth

22:08.840 --> 22:13.640
people paying attention to. Of course, there are problems with what we think of as super genius

22:13.640 --> 22:19.240
because might a aboriginal tracker who doesn't solve Rubik's cubes particularly well or do the

22:19.240 --> 22:23.480
normal IQ things be a super genius in a totally different set of dimensions on things we can't

22:23.480 --> 22:33.000
even perceive with our normal cognitive science kind of models, sure. But if we just take what

22:33.000 --> 22:42.520
he was meaning here, he was saying it seems that the Isaac Newton's and Einstein's and

22:44.600 --> 22:53.560
the people that contributed novel insights to many fields that specialists in those fields

22:53.560 --> 22:58.360
appreciated and hadn't done, that we are seeing less of that recently than we have in a long time.

22:58.360 --> 23:02.760
And this is a whole fascinating debate. I know I'm a bit off topic, but I find this an interesting

23:02.760 --> 23:09.000
topic and maybe relevant. Some people think the idea that there is less super genius now is just

23:09.000 --> 23:14.520
wrong and some kind of romanticizing the past, but there's pretty meaningful data in here in

23:14.520 --> 23:21.240
terms of how quickly do new scientific insights happen or philosophical insights or legal insights

23:21.240 --> 23:25.000
happen that are paradigm shifting that would change a Cooney and paradigm or something like that.

23:25.880 --> 23:30.200
Some people think it's that there's just so much more fucking knowledge now than there was that you

23:30.200 --> 23:33.720
just can't be a polymath that you could have been a polymath before and all the stuff and

23:33.720 --> 23:38.920
nobody can now that it takes all of your life to be a specialist in a tiny discipline and that the

23:38.920 --> 23:43.320
only thing that can make breakthroughs now is huge teams of specialist scientists with big data

23:43.320 --> 23:51.480
processing AIs. There's a lot of different ideas about it. Feynman famously said that he thought

23:51.480 --> 23:55.400
he would be in the last generation of great physicists for some time based on what he saw

23:55.400 --> 24:02.440
happening in the direction of physics and the direction of education and there have certainly

24:02.440 --> 24:06.840
been some developments in physics since but maybe not of the type from modern physics to him.

24:09.160 --> 24:14.520
I think there is some truth in this that has that we are actually developing people of that type

24:14.520 --> 24:19.240
less globally independent of the increasing complexity of the world as also a factor.

24:20.200 --> 24:26.920
I think there's a few reasons for it but one of them that seems to be pretty compelling and so this

24:29.080 --> 24:33.880
this article about where the super genius has gone puts forth that there is a lot of data

24:33.880 --> 24:39.640
that points to the idea that most of the great polymaths the super geniuses if you want to call

24:39.640 --> 24:44.920
it were have one thing really clearly in common obviously not a hundred percent correlation but

24:44.920 --> 24:50.280
a higher correlation than anything else which was that they were the result of aristocratic tutoring

24:50.280 --> 24:58.040
high quality aristocratic tutoring and that post the kind of modernity and democratic

24:58.040 --> 25:04.600
reformation of the world there was no aristocratic tutoring of the same kind and that it really makes

25:04.600 --> 25:11.960
a difference so if you think about it this little boy in Tibet identifies certain bulls

25:11.960 --> 25:16.200
in pain so we say he's the Dalai Lama from a reincarnation perspective but then how does he

25:16.200 --> 25:24.520
get educated right yeah right the top llamas in Tibet who are the top meditators and oracles and

25:24.520 --> 25:28.920
philosophers and historians and scholars and mathematicians are all privately training this

25:28.920 --> 25:34.760
boy with the investment of their entire culture is the Dalai Lama the result of an educational

25:34.760 --> 25:38.840
paradigm that doesn't really scale because how could you have the best teachers of a whole

25:38.920 --> 25:45.080
peoples you know for everybody and is the Dalai Lama's type of consciousness and capacity

25:45.080 --> 25:49.000
actually something that could be trained if people had access to that it's a fair question

25:50.600 --> 25:57.720
when you read meditations by Marcus Aurelius which is also a great philosophic text the first

25:57.720 --> 26:03.240
chapter he dedicates just to his tutors right the intact like he writes the book of stoic philosophy

26:03.240 --> 26:07.160
as the emperor of Rome and the first chapter is just a dedication to his tutors because when

26:07.160 --> 26:12.280
you're being raised to be the emperor of Rome during Rome's high period the best mathematician

26:12.280 --> 26:17.880
in all of Rome is your math teacher and the best historian and there was another study I had seen

26:17.880 --> 26:23.560
I find this theory of education stuff so deeply fascinating there's a study I'd seen that was

26:23.560 --> 26:30.760
looking at world class or what were considered first rate mathematicians and they had some way

26:30.760 --> 26:35.160
of defining what a first rate mathematician was and it wasn't just a field's medal it was something

26:35.960 --> 26:40.920
some set of things but the highest statistical correlator they could find across everyone who

26:40.920 --> 26:45.560
became a first rate mathematician to see like is there some trait that where we can predict this

26:45.560 --> 26:49.400
is that when they were young they started to study with a first rate mathematician

26:50.920 --> 26:55.160
and of course someone could do a correlation causation question and say was it only because

26:55.160 --> 27:00.600
they had such exceptional ability that a first rate mathematician paid attention to them when

27:00.600 --> 27:04.760
they were young but it does not appear that that is the direction of causation that they

27:04.760 --> 27:09.560
got exposed to a first rate mathematician was teaching at their particular school for a while

27:09.560 --> 27:13.320
at the time whatever because there are certain classes where a whole bunch of them came out of

27:13.320 --> 27:18.920
that class where that teacher was and it makes sense because your average first grade or 12th

27:18.920 --> 27:24.920
grade math teacher at a high school is not a first rate mathematician they're not even a second or

27:24.920 --> 27:29.800
third rate mathematician the the brilliance of mathematical thinking the love of it the insight

27:29.800 --> 27:34.040
the passion they don't have it they have something else right they study to be an educator they study

27:34.040 --> 27:37.240
in a country that couldn't pay you all that much to be an educator so they aren't even a first

27:37.240 --> 27:43.640
rate educator so can you learn how to think like a first rate mathematician from a normal math teacher

27:43.640 --> 27:49.400
who is themselves someone who has never even had thought like that probably not and the same would

27:49.400 --> 27:55.400
be true for spiritual insight or for anything else and so when you look at Marcus Aurelius you're

27:55.400 --> 27:59.960
like it was who he was actually just the result of a good educational model and

28:00.440 --> 28:08.520
when the modern democracies were forming the idea of feudalism was so disgusting and

28:08.520 --> 28:12.440
were pregnant for many reasons and had to be shed away that anything that was a remnant of

28:12.440 --> 28:17.800
feudalism had to be put away but in democratizing education to raise higher education for so many

28:17.800 --> 28:23.880
people you also lowered the highest version of education to where the wealthy people whose

28:23.880 --> 28:28.600
kids are getting tutoring today is to keep up with the normal scholastics of a curriculum based thing

28:28.680 --> 28:37.560
it's not a personalized tutoring system for the most part and so I do partly why I was bringing

28:37.560 --> 28:43.960
this up is that you know I didn't have a whole field of tutors but I had parents that were doing

28:43.960 --> 28:51.160
that with me and then because I saw how valuable it was to have invested people be in that level

28:51.160 --> 28:57.320
of dialogue I started seeking out tutors before I even knew this and this is like maybe the highest

28:57.320 --> 29:05.640
thing I can recommend to young people or for parents what to do with their kids I somehow

29:05.640 --> 29:10.120
knew because I also had stuff like think and grow rich and the kind of like tenacity of a

29:10.120 --> 29:14.440
Carnegie to be self-directed as part of the thing but hopefully along a different set of goals than

29:14.440 --> 29:19.480
just monetary accumulation but if you have the tenacity of a Carnegie associated with other

29:19.480 --> 29:25.480
developmental goals which would be a really good thing whenever I found a teacher that seemed like

29:25.480 --> 29:29.960
they knew something I really wanted to learn I figured out what I could possibly do to be useful

29:29.960 --> 29:36.440
to them and that looked like cleaning their house and changing babies diapers and learning skills I

29:36.440 --> 29:40.120
didn't have they needed electrical done I would learn electrical to those like whatever the fuck

29:40.120 --> 29:43.560
it is this is where I want to study from so I'm going to figure out how to be around them and be useful

29:43.560 --> 29:51.480
to them and so much of my learning was not what I studied in university that was cool or even just

29:51.480 --> 29:57.080
in books on my own it was people who were really really fucking brilliant spending time with me

29:57.080 --> 30:01.400
directly because I figured out how to partly I was a gift and partly I figured out how to make that

30:01.400 --> 30:08.200
happen and Daniel is part of what you're saying as far as the tutor also a mentor relationship

30:08.200 --> 30:14.200
having older people that can not only just download information but somehow impact your soul and your

30:14.200 --> 30:21.240
being and you know it's all together see in a mentoring relationship they're not just topical

30:21.240 --> 30:26.840
artists right they're who have because they're teaching to a whole class have to teach a curriculum

30:27.960 --> 30:32.120
you're the kid is asking them questions that they're interested in the range beyond their

30:32.120 --> 30:38.680
subject matter and the and the teacher in that relationship actually cares about them and loves

30:38.680 --> 30:42.280
them and gets invested in their education so they ended up getting the benefit of something like good

30:42.280 --> 30:46.360
parenting but multiplied by a lot more people a lot more capacities that error correct each other

30:47.160 --> 30:52.600
and so the cognitive education shouldn't be limited to one domain separate from others it

30:52.600 --> 30:56.520
should go across the domains but it shouldn't be limited to just cognitive education it should be

30:56.520 --> 31:03.880
that the you know and so first the various domains of ontology need to integrate it you need to be

31:03.880 --> 31:09.960
able to think about biology and chemistry and physics and etc together next is you have to

31:09.960 --> 31:13.880
integrate a cross ontology and epistemology whenever the kid is learning something it's not

31:13.880 --> 31:18.200
just here is how it works it's why does it work that way how is that discovered that this is one

31:18.200 --> 31:27.160
of the next key insights is I never wanted to know a formula in math I wanted to know how long

31:27.160 --> 31:31.320
people knew that that problem was interesting and didn't have the formula who discovered at first

31:31.320 --> 31:35.640
what novel thing about their life gave them that insight what other new things they discovered

31:35.640 --> 31:42.600
afterwards because of that you know like I wanted to know the epistemology and I find that when you

31:42.600 --> 31:48.920
get that and you start to get what is the generator function of novel insight what is across all the

31:48.920 --> 31:53.000
domains the the people who discovered the most important thing what was happening in them that

31:53.000 --> 31:57.080
made them discover the most important thing you can start to develop that in yourself rather than

31:57.080 --> 32:03.000
just a huge knowledge set in which case we're just shitty computers and so you want to integrate

32:03.000 --> 32:07.080
all the ontologies you want to integrate ontology and epistemology and then all of that in the

32:07.080 --> 32:12.440
cognitive domain you want to integrate to why do you care at all why do you care to want to learn so

32:12.440 --> 32:17.960
the ethics the aesthetics the pragmatics also come in and the identity of the person in relationship

32:17.960 --> 32:25.480
to it comes in and and and is there a developmental sense of responsibility that's transmitted it's

32:25.480 --> 32:30.440
like I don't want to let my dad down my mom down these people that taught me I want to live up to

32:31.400 --> 32:35.240
the the quality of the love and the gifts and the knowledge that they're imparting to me

32:39.080 --> 32:39.480
you know

32:48.120 --> 32:50.680
people being motivated to care about

32:53.560 --> 32:57.480
people and animals and life forms that they will never meet and will never give them credit

32:58.360 --> 33:02.120
like it takes some work it takes some developmental work to get there enough that

33:02.120 --> 33:08.680
you'll make real sacrifices to care where you don't get any obvious credit for that it takes

33:08.680 --> 33:15.640
having some sense of your identity expanded beyond your own individual self where you're

33:15.640 --> 33:19.800
looking through their eyes right and you're and you get that they actually matter to you

33:19.880 --> 33:31.000
reality but at first if somebody believes in a sky god that is all knowing all seeing and

33:31.000 --> 33:35.480
internal punishment if you fuck up and they know your thoughts so you can't just virtue signal

33:35.480 --> 33:41.000
because you can't virtue signal the god that knows it and eternal reward if you get it right so

33:41.000 --> 33:45.000
even if you're really just a shithead who just doesn't want to get punished and wants to get a

33:45.000 --> 33:49.320
reward you still have to be good all the way down to the level of your thoughts that's kind of awesome

33:49.800 --> 33:53.240
right like from the point of view of just how do you get a lot of people who might still be

33:53.240 --> 33:58.120
narcissists in a low degree of truly ethical development to do the right thing that kind of

33:58.120 --> 34:05.240
like sky god judicial system is kind of awesome and another now it's also terrible because then

34:05.240 --> 34:08.760
of course everybody's terrified of burning in hell forever and has to think that someone else

34:08.760 --> 34:13.560
who's not getting it right is and they have to terrify their kids of burning in hell but

34:13.800 --> 34:21.240
but in the same way the idea that many many traditions had that when I die I'm going to be

34:21.240 --> 34:29.960
with the ancestors and I'm going to like and there's some glory of my of the great teachers

34:29.960 --> 34:36.120
and will and they're still watching me right and and when I go to be with my forefathers

34:36.120 --> 34:42.440
with the teachers in eternity and afterlife do I actually deserve to be with them

34:43.400 --> 34:47.160
there's something in noble that can do right there's something powerfully ennobling that

34:47.160 --> 34:52.040
old tradition can do of course we also find out that our great teachers are people that have their

34:52.040 --> 34:55.880
failings and weaknesses and we have to wrestle with that and we're going to have our own failings

34:55.880 --> 34:59.000
and weaknesses and we might get intellectually congruent enough to have some doubts on the

34:59.000 --> 35:06.600
metaphysics of that thing but there is there is definitely something even if you don't go to

35:06.600 --> 35:13.800
the metaphysics the afterlife version there is something about feeling that you received

35:14.440 --> 35:18.280
something that you don't get to take credit for that you're fortunate that someone else was born

35:18.280 --> 35:23.320
into a situation that if you were born into you'd be doing less well and that you were fortunate to

35:23.320 --> 35:29.800
get to have these experiences and that you owe something to them and to the future world because

35:29.800 --> 35:38.520
of that fortune I think that's really important anyway I've got to bring this up preparing for

35:38.520 --> 35:43.720
this I went to your websites and I came across a blog article you've written things that I learned

35:43.720 --> 35:53.240
from my dad I was deeply moved by this I halfway through when we got to the part how to treat women

35:53.240 --> 36:01.320
I think I started weeping and immediately I like your father but I like you because this is what

36:01.320 --> 36:09.880
you remembered from your father and it was so incredibly powerful and basic and I see such a

36:09.880 --> 36:19.400
need for young men to be initiated into some sort of positive manhood and what your father laid out

36:19.400 --> 36:23.080
I got a lot from my father but obviously he was not as articulate as your dad

36:23.080 --> 36:27.960
that he lived a lot of these principles that you were talking about and can I read one of them

36:31.480 --> 36:40.680
I love this the highest value for men is serving women nature and children future generations

36:40.680 --> 36:42.360
the highest value for men

36:42.360 --> 36:48.920
you should shout it from the rooftops that's incredibly profound

36:52.040 --> 36:56.520
yeah my dad would say things all the time like you're either serving your family or the family

36:56.520 --> 37:01.080
of mankind or your off-path those are the only two things that you can be doing that are not off-path

37:02.440 --> 37:09.960
and the family of mankind was the term used but inclusive of life not just human life

37:13.320 --> 37:21.240
yeah I mean I wrote that because my dad's health was very delicate at the time and it wasn't clear

37:21.240 --> 37:28.440
if he was going to be around much longer or not and so often people write a eulogy of all the things

37:28.440 --> 37:32.360
that they appreciated from their parent after they're dead and they don't get to experience it

37:32.360 --> 37:39.880
directly and I thought that that would be a loss and so I wanted to write it for that reason

37:40.680 --> 37:45.400
but I also wanted to write it that particular one is definitely not a full expression

37:46.120 --> 37:51.400
of what I learned from my dad it was called things I learned about being a man from my dad

37:53.080 --> 37:57.640
and so it was it was definitely oriented to the

37:59.480 --> 38:03.720
principles that have to do with transfer of masculinity as opposed to just would be equally

38:03.720 --> 38:09.080
true for all people some of them are of course that and part of the reason that I wrote it at

38:09.160 --> 38:17.240
that time was I think I had had in conversations a rise in the week or two before of

38:19.080 --> 38:29.400
men young men so boy into man phase who had just clearly never been fathered in important ways

38:29.400 --> 38:35.000
and were causing pain to women they were in relationships with to people around them were

38:35.000 --> 38:45.400
being or leaders and it was just I was like there are so many people that didn't have so many men

38:45.400 --> 38:49.960
that are in their masculine role not having the fortune of having had a good role model of

38:49.960 --> 38:57.080
teaching in that way and I wonder if some tiny little bit of vicarious element of it can come

38:57.080 --> 39:03.080
through by writing about it so that's why I wrote that one in that way I think it came through for

39:03.080 --> 39:09.800
me brother thank you for that and one of the things he said is like on your time off what you

39:09.800 --> 39:14.200
do is you get in your pickup truck this was before cell phones and all and you drive around and find

39:14.200 --> 39:19.080
people are having trouble with their cars getting them started you you fix their cars and send them

39:19.080 --> 39:23.320
on their way and he said that's a good time that's the way to spend your day off and it's all

39:23.320 --> 39:31.320
his orientation noble disinterested service and it's just anyway but it was so funny because

39:31.320 --> 39:37.240
yeah this was before cell phones and so when someone broke down on the side of the road

39:37.240 --> 39:43.560
pulling over to pick them up was an important thing and you know my I think part of teaching

39:43.560 --> 39:51.240
someone about how the world works in general and also part of the ideas and I understand this is

39:51.400 --> 39:59.880
normative like by gender normative thinking on the thing that is how it was given to me

40:01.800 --> 40:09.800
was that for a boy growing into a man knowing how to solve problems and fix things

40:09.800 --> 40:16.360
was a particularly important thing so anytime there was construction to do he always involved

40:16.360 --> 40:20.680
me and it even were involving me and it took a lot more time than doing it without me because

40:21.240 --> 40:26.680
he was not just trying to fix the thing he was also trying to raise a child who would someday

40:27.320 --> 40:31.000
not just be an adult but would themselves be a parent and a teacher and how to

40:31.000 --> 40:34.760
do that thing properly and whenever there was something to fix on the car it took

40:34.760 --> 40:43.160
10 times longer to show me how to do it and you know then then not and so but then it was also

40:43.160 --> 40:48.040
while we're fixing the car there were so many things like if a job is worth doing it's worth

40:48.040 --> 40:53.080
doing well and well begun is half done and see the job do the job stay out of the misery these

40:53.080 --> 40:59.320
kind of idioms and the if the job is worth doing it's worth doing well meant just no half-assing

40:59.320 --> 41:04.920
the thing like we and so like I'll give you an example that was so beautiful I remember the

41:04.920 --> 41:12.520
first time we're building a building from the ground up we laid the studs and then we drilled

41:12.600 --> 41:20.360
to the studs to run the wire for the outlets and it was very important to my dad that the way the

41:20.360 --> 41:28.280
wiring was in the wall before the drywall went on was beautiful that the holes were at the same

41:28.280 --> 41:34.200
height that the Romex was not twisted and that it was beautiful and no one would ever fucking see it

41:34.200 --> 41:41.480
we're about to cover it in drywall and you're like why and he's like you know you know you know

41:41.560 --> 41:47.640
it's an incredible teaching that's and there's something where it's like the if you can do it

41:47.640 --> 41:52.760
any of the ways do it the way that is the most integrous the most awful the most beautiful

41:53.400 --> 41:57.640
and you will feel better about it and you'll feel better about who you are and then your

41:57.640 --> 42:00.920
unconscious default in the moments where it matters and other things will be to do the

42:00.920 --> 42:04.760
thing in the highest way you possibly can as opposed to asking the corner cutting questions and

42:05.560 --> 42:11.480
um so the if it's worth doing it's worth doing well see the job do the job stay out of the misery

42:11.480 --> 42:18.600
meant uh don't even ask if it's possible and definitely don't bitch about it just if it needs

42:18.600 --> 42:24.520
done figure out how to do it and do it with the best attitude because you have choice over your

42:24.520 --> 42:31.000
attitude and why would you do it any other way um and well begun is half done meant have you

42:31.000 --> 42:34.760
cleaned the space first have you set out the tools do you know what the workflow is going to be

42:34.760 --> 42:38.360
because the problems that are going to come up when you've opened everything up it's up on the

42:38.360 --> 42:41.720
jacks and you realize you're missing something and you have to go to the store like that's where

42:41.720 --> 42:44.840
the danger happened that's where someone gets hurt that's where the inefficiency happens that's

42:45.720 --> 42:53.400
so think through the process pretty well first um and anticipate where the mistakes and the

42:53.400 --> 42:56.200
problems and the challenges are going to happen there's so much of my work in the

42:56.200 --> 43:00.680
metacrisis that is anticipate where the unanticipated externalities going to happen

43:02.200 --> 43:08.280
and then internalize those future externalities into the choice making process better and uh yeah

43:09.000 --> 43:18.360
yeah like I can see now how you are basically uh self-taught and coached and mentored into

43:19.240 --> 43:26.680
uh into the ideals which would lead you into a life of service into a way of thinking

43:26.680 --> 43:36.680
which would bring you into a big picture approach and into a planning mode that would allow you to

43:36.680 --> 43:46.200
anticipate second third order complications and to think through those to uh you were honed for

43:46.200 --> 43:51.720
the work you're doing now wait there's something that I was starting to say it's important please

43:51.720 --> 43:54.760
remember your thought because I don't want you to forget it but I don't want to forget this

43:55.560 --> 44:01.080
but you were you had um mentioned John the um that a fun time was to load up the tools

44:01.720 --> 44:04.520
and go looking for people who are broken down and fix up their car because

44:04.520 --> 44:07.560
AAA wouldn't necessarily come all the time especially if it was snowing outside they

44:07.560 --> 44:16.760
could actually be in danger um so obviously that meant you know there I had to know some

44:16.760 --> 44:23.880
how to fix a car type skills so I was mentioning that my dad would take a lot more time to do the

44:23.880 --> 44:27.800
thing than pay someone else to do it and to do it with me than do it on his own because he was

44:27.800 --> 44:35.080
wanting me to learn learning these other deeper psychological spiritual integrity lessons along

44:35.080 --> 44:40.760
with it like well begun is half done and if a job's worth doing this worth doing well but then

44:40.760 --> 44:47.960
also um learning the mechanical engineering of why was the screw threaded this way rather than the

44:47.960 --> 44:53.160
other way and why was the sting built this way and then the history of internal combustion engines

44:53.160 --> 44:59.640
and when the transmission came out and the um you know like and and then the physics of how

45:00.280 --> 45:04.040
the explosion happens inside of the piston and so there's a very integrated set

45:04.760 --> 45:10.840
of knowledge that was happening and that takes just a lot of investment right takes a lot of

45:10.840 --> 45:18.360
care and a lot of investment and but then when we would do that it was like sunday father son

45:18.360 --> 45:26.120
let's have fun um he wasn't into sports so we didn't throw a ball uh that's my my

45:26.120 --> 45:30.760
anti-coordination at the level of ball throwing didn't develop all that much but we would uh

45:32.520 --> 45:36.760
load the load the truck up with tools and go look for people who are broken down and fix it

45:36.760 --> 45:44.280
up and the interesting thing was it didn't feel like some dreadful sacrifice of service that we

45:44.280 --> 45:50.040
had to do the way that a lot of people um feel when they're doing some church activity as kids

45:50.040 --> 45:54.360
they don't like it felt like the most fun thing we could possibly do like it was just actually

45:54.360 --> 45:58.040
really enjoyable because one i'm getting this high quality time with my dad right he's not

45:58.040 --> 46:03.640
trying to get me to go do the thing on my own who we're getting to be learning in the process

46:03.640 --> 46:07.560
and then helping people where there's this immediate you know expression of these people

46:07.560 --> 46:13.000
being delighted and surprised and so there was absolutely it wasn't just like an ethic of service

46:13.000 --> 46:21.080
it was like a like a way to condition that as that the what i want for myself personally and

46:21.080 --> 46:28.600
who i want to be for the world there wasn't even a distinction yeah beautiful yeah and

46:29.400 --> 46:34.280
another thing your dad said and i'll stop parping on your dad i could go on and on this but he said

46:34.280 --> 46:42.120
and this is so simple but so profound he said forgive just as a given you've got to forgive

46:42.120 --> 46:48.920
and the second part is help them do better so you just don't forgive okay i'm okay i'm clear

46:48.920 --> 46:53.720
you know i didn't bother anymore because i forgive him but the other part is help them

46:53.720 --> 46:59.720
do better i just think that's one of my and i was a kid and there's a period where my

47:00.920 --> 47:06.520
parents were in the tm community and built this beautiful community called lake view

47:06.520 --> 47:12.280
estates out in fairfield and we're working on on the kind of enlightened theme park and

47:12.280 --> 47:19.480
and a development business and there was someone that was an extremely close friend of the family

47:19.480 --> 47:31.960
and um kind of employee and partner who had for whatever reasons um decided that he was going to

47:32.920 --> 47:38.760
come into our house and steal a bunch of the artwork and uh because he you know had the

47:38.760 --> 47:47.080
key to the house and all like that and uh you know but the trail like that oftentimes very easy to be

47:47.080 --> 47:54.200
like want to be vindictive or at least totally cut ties i remember my dad intercepting him

47:54.200 --> 47:58.200
not letting him do that and then taking him out and having this conversation like dude what the

47:58.200 --> 48:03.800
fuck like what happened inside your head is this who you want to be and and there was still to like

48:03.800 --> 48:13.800
help them do better um and one of the ones that really stood out to me and you know i there's

48:13.800 --> 48:19.320
something where i feel torn about this first just as a caveat i must say the reason i didn't

48:19.320 --> 48:24.520
write one about my mom at the time was because i don't think there is as gruesome a deficit of

48:24.520 --> 48:30.120
mothering in the world as there is fathering currently and so i didn't have as many women

48:31.080 --> 48:36.840
in sharing with me just like kind of abject failures of fundamental things as i had guys so

48:36.840 --> 48:42.440
i was a little bit more motivated for that reason also her health is better but my mother is also

48:42.440 --> 48:48.440
everybody's important in in my life and childhood and who i became and uh was the one that got me

48:48.440 --> 48:53.240
into activism and had me going door to door with and had all the protests with pita and greenpeace

48:53.240 --> 48:58.920
and all those things as a kid and got me studying art and introduced me to dolly and picasso and

48:59.000 --> 49:04.200
jebron and blake and you know brought me to all the world religions churches and

49:06.520 --> 49:14.840
but going back to my dad here my dad had a strong patriarchal line that taught him some

49:14.840 --> 49:19.560
of these things his dad was first generation green beret and so that you know taught that way

49:20.120 --> 49:23.960
but he also had a really fucked up childhood with a humongous amount of trauma

49:24.760 --> 49:30.200
his dad commits suicide his sister commits suicide is many of his family members were in

49:30.200 --> 49:38.440
and out of incarceration in mental institutions and and the violence of the childhood he was in

49:38.440 --> 49:45.720
he's covered in physical scars from weapons you know like he had a rough go of it and so

49:45.720 --> 49:52.760
some of what he got he got directly but a lot of it was his way to not kill himself was to say

49:52.760 --> 49:57.080
maybe he's not crazy the entire world is crazy because the whole world he was exposed to seem

49:57.080 --> 50:04.600
completely crazy to him and he'd rethink everything from scratch and so when you do that you come up

50:04.600 --> 50:08.520
with a lot of good and interesting things and also are going to make a lot of mistakes and

50:08.520 --> 50:14.040
their painful parts in the process and I didn't emphasize those in that letter because it wasn't

50:14.840 --> 50:23.240
the purpose of the letter the article but you know my path benefited from all the extreme

50:23.240 --> 50:30.360
gifts and it had some like quite interesting hardships as a result of the complexity of

50:30.360 --> 50:36.520
who he was from transcending his life all those other things is what got me into therapy young

50:36.520 --> 50:41.080
and which I'm also very grateful for because then I ended up getting a huge amount of

50:41.720 --> 50:46.040
you know basically parenting from the therapeutic traditions

50:48.680 --> 50:54.600
the reason I say that is so that people don't think oh well I can't do well because I had trauma

50:54.600 --> 50:58.920
because I didn't have some of these gifts I everybody's life has some gifts and has some

50:58.920 --> 51:02.840
fucked up stuff and the difficult stuff the healing of it is what catalyzes their gifts

51:03.640 --> 51:08.920
and I just want to say that and some of the gifts that he had were really

51:10.120 --> 51:15.640
fairly rare and unusual I'm very grateful for that some of the issues he had were somewhat

51:16.440 --> 51:24.360
unusual but when it comes to one of the things on the forgive he definitely had the gift of being

51:24.360 --> 51:30.040
physically heroic and there are military men who are trained in that a lot of people are not

51:30.680 --> 51:33.880
in this age physically heroic in previous ages that was much more common

51:34.920 --> 51:40.040
and there was a time here in Encinitas when I was like 20

51:42.040 --> 51:45.640
where which is usually not a violent area my dad was in the

51:47.960 --> 51:53.640
parking lot on thoroughfare here El Camino Real gunshots rang out handful of gunshots

51:54.200 --> 52:03.480
from a blind store and everybody who was in the parking lot ran the other way or dropped my dad

52:03.480 --> 52:09.720
ran straight at the blind store he figured the shooter was still alive and in there turned out

52:09.720 --> 52:14.840
the shooter after killing the other person killed himself so by the time my dad got in there the

52:14.840 --> 52:22.040
shooter was dead it was a husband who was going in there to suicide homicide his wife

52:23.000 --> 52:32.200
and the but he shot himself he stabbed her and when he thought he had finished killing her

52:32.200 --> 52:40.280
then he shot himself when my dad got there she was bleeding out but not dead and so he started

52:40.280 --> 52:45.000
to put compression and turn the kits and whatever on you know all the areas where the ambulance

52:45.000 --> 52:50.440
and police came but then he went to the hospital to be with her and then followed up with her

52:50.520 --> 52:58.680
afterwards and in addition to like she would have bled out if he was not there saving her life

52:58.680 --> 53:05.720
was him wanting to make sure that she could forgive her husband for that because of knowing how

53:05.720 --> 53:10.920
fucked up he was and that he's no longer you know in pain himself or a risk to anybody else

53:10.920 --> 53:17.160
but that was like it was his default mode and I mean almost too fast that it can be a bypass

53:17.240 --> 53:23.080
but in that moment it was both and you know just a very interesting thing about him is like

53:24.040 --> 53:29.160
thinking the shooter was still alive he thought I can keep my body moving long enough if I take

53:29.160 --> 53:34.840
shots that I can take him out and more civilians won't get killed which means he was willing to

53:34.840 --> 53:39.160
risk his life for people he had never met didn't even couldn't even see to know what color they were

53:39.160 --> 53:45.240
a race or whatever this is very noble very beautiful and then the moment the harm of the

53:45.880 --> 53:49.880
dying was out of the way the harm of her holding on to that grudging sentiment was the next one he

53:49.880 --> 54:02.760
was focused on. What a gift to be exposed to and live with someone like that and not only an education

54:02.760 --> 54:13.320
but a transmission of normal values and priorities and to take up a theme a question I began with a

54:13.320 --> 54:20.280
little while ago as you've described this it's getting more and more clear how your life has been

54:21.560 --> 54:30.840
self-developed and honed and gifted by multiple people to bring you to your life's work which has

54:30.840 --> 54:40.040
been the metacrisis and how we as a species and a civilization can continue because clearly we're

54:40.040 --> 54:46.040
in danger right now and presumably will be forever after because the technology is probably only

54:46.040 --> 54:55.560
going to get more developed and greater capacities etc so you've been you've been you've had these

54:55.560 --> 55:04.360
ideals of service transmitted to you've had attitudes of handling them schoolfully looking

55:04.360 --> 55:13.240
for complications thinking ahead etc you've also had the multidisciplinary education so how does the

55:14.920 --> 55:23.400
how does the to these depths the spiritual depths that and self-inquiry you've gone through not

55:23.400 --> 55:29.800
only in spirituality but in psychotherapy and philosophic inquiry how do these how do these

55:29.880 --> 55:37.800
depths inform you about our contemporary crises and what do you see lacking that these

55:38.520 --> 55:53.800
these steps when these depths aren't appreciated what do we miss

55:54.760 --> 56:09.880
I was speaking with a friend recently who does conservation work and she's a brilliant conservationist

56:09.880 --> 56:19.720
who has kept huge important areas of high biodiversity intact and has done so at a

56:19.720 --> 56:24.200
significant devotion including expense of her own personal life and in other areas

56:25.880 --> 56:35.160
we're talking and she had just been in conversation with some of the world's wealthiest people

56:36.200 --> 56:45.160
and she asked me when someone asks why should we protect nature how to answer it

56:45.880 --> 56:55.400
because that was obviously their question and I said well there's a lot of answers that we can give

56:56.520 --> 57:03.400
that from a you from the utility perspective of helping them get why they should care we

57:03.400 --> 57:07.400
we look at what they currently care about and we show a rationalized argument between why

57:08.920 --> 57:12.680
the harm that would come to nature would harm something they would care about right we draw

57:12.680 --> 57:19.960
those connections but before getting there the fact that someone has to ask that question in

57:19.960 --> 57:27.320
earnest speaks to something broken in them at minimum something pathologically underdeveloped

57:28.840 --> 57:37.320
and if they had had a life where they grew up in any real contact with their own embodiment

57:37.320 --> 57:42.280
their own kind of biology and experience of being in a body being and in any real contact with

57:42.920 --> 57:48.520
nature and other sentient beings that question just wouldn't even arise

57:50.840 --> 57:54.920
it would be prima facie right it would be it would be obvious and the question would simply be

57:54.920 --> 58:06.920
how do we do a better job with it and I saw one of the in the brief look one of the questions

58:07.000 --> 58:13.720
that you sometimes explore with guests of like what are the questions that orient their relationship

58:13.720 --> 58:22.680
to the sacred and I think at the at the heart of it it's not even a question right it's a

58:23.800 --> 58:32.840
something more like a perception I think if someone is perceiving somewhat clearly

58:33.240 --> 58:43.240
then the sacredness of life is prima facie just is and I don't remember the exact quote but it was a

58:46.200 --> 58:49.240
Joseph Campbell quote that was something to the effect of

58:50.440 --> 58:56.520
that we think what we want is to know what the meaning of life is when what we're

58:56.520 --> 59:01.480
actually seeking is the experience of being fully alive and I don't think that is the whole

59:01.480 --> 59:05.240
because someone can experience being fully alive in fairly self-centered ways just doing

59:06.440 --> 59:13.400
you know extreme sports and whatever but it is also true that in the moments where someone is

59:13.400 --> 59:17.960
experiencing feeling fully alive they're not an existential angst about what is the meaning of life

59:18.920 --> 59:25.800
and I think that oftentimes the actual intrinsic sacredness and meaningful of

59:25.800 --> 59:32.200
meaningfulness of life that happens through a deep enough bandwidth of connection and sensing

59:35.480 --> 59:42.680
the longing for that it's filtered through the mind as a desire to understand what is the purpose

59:42.680 --> 59:46.920
of all of this what is the meaning with a whole bunch of bad assumptions about like what thing is

59:46.920 --> 59:54.040
it building to that seems like a terminal value that then I can't then that will be a satisfying

59:54.040 --> 59:57.560
answer where if we say well the purpose is love then I say well what is the purpose of that or

59:57.560 --> 01:00:06.120
the purpose is learning well what is the purpose of it it's so we can the first the concept of

01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:11.960
purpose and the concept of meaningfulness are not identical but the reality of them and the

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:26.520
concept of them are not the same either and so how to develop a deeper connection to the

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:35.960
a deeper connection to life and deeper ability to perceive the innate uniqueness of everything

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:39.800
and the interconnectedness of everything at the same time right the interconnectedness of it all

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:46.360
but not it's not it's not a homogenous oneness where because if it's a homogenous oneness

01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:49.960
it doesn't matter how many of these ones die it doesn't matter if the species goes the oneness

01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:55.480
is still oneness if it is just uniqueness but not interconnectedness well then in the service

01:00:55.480 --> 01:01:00.600
of this one I can damage these ones it's every part unique and every part radically interconnected

01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:06.680
in which case it is all an expression of the whole so I whatever I care about I also have

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:11.080
to care about all of it because it's connected and also each part is irreplaceable and those

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:16.440
totally precious right and it's not that is the thought it's that is the perception

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:25.720
from there from that base state of perception I think the right other questions and analytics

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:35.480
more naturally arise yes so the to the extent we can open ourselves to

01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:46.280
the totality of experience to to life the world and to ourselves to that extent in some ways

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:51.720
and so in one sense one could say the questions fall away because the questions are conceptual

01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:56.920
and we're you're now speaking to an experiential openness and directness

01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:06.840
that give birth to understandings or intuitions which can flower into concepts

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:13.240
obviously I'm obviously into concepts right I'm obviously into work

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:20.440
you're a good company um I wrote a blog piece a while ago called the dance of the

01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:26.120
Tao and the 10 000 things and maybe that one can be linked I'm specifically talking about that because

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:34.760
you know there's this concept in Taoism that every day in the practice of knowledge something is

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:42.040
added every day in the practice of the Tao something is dropped and but I think they are

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:50.040
both meaningful and I think that not only there's a way in which learning more about the 10 000

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:56.440
things the field of conceptuality and interfere with one's connection to the Tao there's a way

01:02:56.440 --> 01:03:01.480
that it can also enhance it yes you don't know how they can dance together if you don't know how it

01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:09.880
can enhance it then you have to just avoid intellect mind past future mostly the things

01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:14.440
that are uniquely sapient uniquely adult sapient and say look at the lilies of the field look at

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:17.960
the little children you're like yes the things that don't have the prefrontal cortex yes the

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:23.240
prefrontal adult brain can cause problems but it also has unique evolutionary purposes we just

01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:30.520
have to use it right um and two things there Daniel one one is the intention what's the intention

01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:35.800
of using the intellect is it to get lost in the abstractions or is it in the service of the solution

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:43.400
and the other is the skill and capacity to integrate into a kind of vision logic say

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:49.560
I think those are both part of it I had a friend that I think you know Samantha Sweetwater

01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:55.080
she hasn't been on this podcast she'd be great to be on she just left me a message this morning with

01:03:56.280 --> 01:04:02.360
a thought she was saying the way she phrased it was that sapience is in service of sentience

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:09.000
if it is to be rightly guided oh I thought that was a nice way of phrasing it I um

01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:15.240
in terms of the Greek the true the good and the beautiful triad I remember writing to an

01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:21.480
artist friend of mine on her birthday once uh that the true and the good only matter because

01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:27.800
the beautiful is um or no I think I said truth and goodness only matter because beauty is that

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:32.760
the beauty was actually the fundamental thing if reality did not have intrinsic beauty I wouldn't

01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:37.640
actually care to be good to it or to know it or to whatever there's something that is intrinsic

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:44.360
that is deeper than the why Daniel I plenty yeah I have a follow-up question to all this

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:52.040
and I know they they threw it at Carl Young so uh I'm gonna throw it at you do you believe in God

01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:02.200
I remember many many years ago and I wouldn't phrase it this way

01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:09.400
any what more and there's maybe 15 years ago I wrote a poem called uh the atheist who writes love

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:21.560
poems to God and um it was saying do I believe in God not in any God that is believable meaning

01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:28.680
that I don't remember where it went but the idea that what the word belief means is

01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:41.000
the idea that a proposition about reality actually maps to reality and so belief is a

01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:47.880
thing that can happen inside of propositional logic and propositions have to be formed in

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:58.440
semiotics right in in semantics and syntax do I believe that there is some sentences that I can

01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:07.960
say that define what God is uh where I would say yes that is a description that I think is both

01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:13.160
true and comprehensive and you know adequate and no I don't I think that's why the first verse of

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:16.760
the Tao Te Ching is the Tao that is speakable it's not the eternal Tao so if you believe in the Tao

01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:26.440
you missed the whole fucking thing um if you you can have a outside of semiotics outside of

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:33.080
propositional experience outside of propositional knowledge experience of a kind of wordless knowing

01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:39.480
in a connection to wholeness but you don't then try to reduce that to propositions about the world

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:42.680
so I think there's a lot of people that will have

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:51.320
real experiences that are numinous and transcendent and then try to make a belief based on that

01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:59.800
and I think that's usually misguided so uh if I wanted to speak to beliefs do I think

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:08.840
that consciousness is an emergent property of brains probably not do I think that there

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:15.240
are things that don't have brains including other types of biology and whatever that might

01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:21.240
have some quality or there is something that is like to be them probably yes but I'm holding all

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:29.400
this I say probably even though I think there's some pretty strong arguments uh because I I think

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:36.680
too much certainty about any of these things is really problematic um do I think that

01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:45.080
it might not just be biology but that anything that self-organizes has some type of interiority

01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:55.080
or self-ness in some kind of panpsychic type way yeah sure I do do I think that um

01:07:56.920 --> 01:08:01.320
even though each cell in our brain or body is its own self-organizing thing they come together to

01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:05.880
make something that is synergistically more than the sum of them taken separately yes do I think

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:13.160
that might be true for say universe as a whole or very large things within universe like galaxies

01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:22.520
or whatever yeah I think that's interesting so do I think that um there are types of sentience

01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:32.040
and types of intelligence that are more deep and vast by far than our imagination can think about

01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:39.960
totally do I think that there is the possibility to in some meaningful ways

01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:48.520
connect there and have results come from that connection yes do I think that there is an inherent

01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:56.440
sacredness in all that is physically and metaphysically yes I wouldn't reduce all that to saying I

01:08:56.440 --> 01:09:09.560
believe in God I rather think of it as something more respectful than the reduction to a proposition

01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:17.320
I get that yeah um but but I was actually just talking with um a very close friend the other day

01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:24.760
about an aspect of learning theory there are certain things

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:39.320
that when I learn them I have to work to implement them as effectively as I can because

01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:53.080
I can't not I just I can't not and uh and there are many people who don't have that they um they

01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:57.400
forget like they learn the thing and they forget and they're like oh yeah that was about I forgot

01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:01.320
let me get back on path are they there's some different depth of the care about the thing

01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:05.960
that is of course the result of all the exposure and whatever and I'm like yeah there is something

01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:11.880
where it is like actually like the difference is actually believing there's a god right meaning

01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:19.400
but it and that was the term that I used to just kind of make it simple in which if one actually

01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:25.560
believes there's a god then they can go they can work to perfect themselves go to happily

01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:30.120
die in a holy war whatever it is because there is some superordinate thing that is so fucking

01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:34.920
important that everything else falls in line to that so there there is something for me and

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:38.440
belief in karma can do that right there is something that is like believing in a god

01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:45.640
that is the coordinating basis of everything for me but it isn't believing in a god

01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:53.000
and I can't do better with words no that yes I think that's a very sacred holy answer I think

01:10:53.000 --> 01:11:00.120
you handled it really well and thank you for even even doing that means a lot yeah I'm beautiful that

01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:07.720
certain that some of the some of the intimations in your response were

01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:18.120
about to the uh unknowable mystery of reality bottomless fathomless inconceivable and to the

01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:27.240
transconceptual nature of that mystery and actually of life that that the idea so the

01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:34.840
doubt that can be named is not the eternal doubt and even more than that we can't any statement we

01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:43.160
make is you know in fact it can be valuable but it's never fully adequate to the reality of anything

01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:51.160
and to the extent that you think that you even unconsciously even fuzzily think of it as adequate

01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:56.680
now it's actually harming you yes because now it deadens your perceptions now it creates

01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:03.400
less you don't see the reality you see the frame of the reality that you expect to see it in and

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:07.640
you stop seeing where that model is inadequate which means you stop learning because you're

01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:12.520
now filtering reality through that model because it's convenient so in that thing the dance of the

01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:20.760
doubt and the 10 000 things there's one part where I say do atoms exist I'm like kind of kind of because

01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:27.560
uh and I'm and I didn't play with it from the point of view of is there physicality at all or

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:33.480
is that all just an epiphenomenon of consciousness or is this a simulation I wasn't even playing

01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:39.400
with it from that direction I was just saying do atoms exist well the periodic table works pretty

01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:47.880
well we can actually uh do atomic level engineering and chemistry pretty well right this is it's about

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:57.000
as good a science as we've got there's a a lot of um good empirical things regarding atoms

01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:05.720
but when I define an atom the formal definitions will like we can do it in terms of the Schrodinger

01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:10.680
equation or information theory or particle physics or whatever but we'll say okay you've got nucleons

01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:14.760
and you have electrons and you have orbitals and whatever um you can just say where in the

01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:23.960
periodic table row and column it is and it's an ion or but does that atom exist without the strong

01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:33.480
force does it exist without electromagnetism does it exist without the Higgs field does it exist

01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:38.200
without the gauge bosons that mediate the connections the gluons and the Higgs boson it

01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:42.200
doesn't exist without any of those things and yet none of them are included in the definition

01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:47.640
when we say atom we take them all for granted so if I remove those that are not part of the

01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:55.800
definition do atoms exist nope so if I want to define an atom adequately that it actually exists

01:13:55.800 --> 01:14:05.880
can I do that nope and so I have to take for granted a trans finite amount of reality

01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:14.600
to define this thing in a way that is useful but is it real kind of you've walked your way into

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:22.200
the buddhist shunyata and into the why buddhist wayan philosophy of the concealed and the revealed

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:30.200
that any perspective unveils or conceals a universe and simultaneously conceals another one

01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:37.240
this is absolutely fascinating we could go anywhere with this but I want to I want to ask you

01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:46.200
from this this perspective or these multiple perspectives you're bringing to bear

01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:53.320
on your own your understanding of of everything what do you see as some of the deeper

01:14:53.320 --> 01:15:02.360
unrecognized usually unacknowledged causes of the metacrisis and I'll just give a little context

01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:08.040
and I think one of the beautiful things about the way the way you appreciate the metacons crisis

01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:15.000
is you're very aware of the traps of reductionism or what I would call the single focus fallacy

01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:25.240
which there are three a single issue fallacy the we're facing global warming that's it

01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:32.040
a single cause fallacy it's all due to capitalism and the single solution fallacy so I love the way

01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:39.240
you're thinking transcends those limitations and and recognize the traps of reductionism so

01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:44.280
in asking you what you see as some of the deeper causes I certainly acknowledge that you don't

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:51.960
these aren't it but they are important elements and they're ones that don't often get don't as often

01:15:51.960 --> 01:16:04.040
get spoken to yeah okay so the question as I understood is are are there

01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:12.680
drivers or causes of the issues we face in the world and of the thing that

01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:19.480
I sometimes call the metacrisis that we haven't defined here but I'm defining enough other places

01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:25.640
of someone who is not already familiar they can check it out that are not the ones that we usually

01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:32.200
talk about that are somehow deeper and I'm going to translate that to are there things in the inner

01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:40.920
landscape of people's experience and psyche specifically just when we were saying are there

01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:47.320
spiritual dimensions or interior dimensions the reason I want to make the distinction is because

01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:59.800
I don't know that the term deeper makes sense just for quick point of reference I would not say

01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:05.400
that I am a physicalist or an idealist in the classic philosophical sense of

01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:12.200
physicalist meaning that physics comes first matter and force fields and third person stuff and

01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:18.280
that consciousness emerges from that somewhere nor am I an idealist and that consciousness comes

01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:23.160
first and all of the physics is an emergent property of consciousness structures of mind or

01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:35.320
something I would say that the the subjective stuff and the objective stuff have you want to

01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:39.400
think of that all the words have problems we can talk about first person third person we can talk

01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:50.280
about the quality and the physics but that they are equally fundamental and co-informing

01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:56.440
co-arising facets of an integrated reality and the relationship between them is part of that

01:17:56.440 --> 01:18:03.640
fundamentality so I wouldn't say consciousness is deeper than physics to the nature of reality

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:12.360
I think that's a weird kind of dualism still I think information theory affecting physics has

01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:18.920
already started to get a lot of people at least in this realm because if you say okay well consciousness

01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:23.240
stuff is deeper than physics stuff and like well what is physics stuff well it's like atoms

01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:29.720
atoms are subatomic particles and subatomic particles are some weird Heisenbergian Schrodinger

01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:37.400
thing which seems a lot like some type of pattern of information that doesn't sound like physics

01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:44.600
anymore right and it doesn't necessarily sound as different it's not like just some dead inert

01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:47.960
matter it doesn't sound as different from the consciousness stuff especially as you start to

01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:51.880
do a similar dive on what the consciousness stuff is because you say well is that information

01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:57.640
processing on some information processing substrate what does that mean so in the same way

01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:03.800
that I wouldn't say consciousness is deeper than physics or the other way around I wouldn't say that

01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:11.240
the psychological drivers of the metacrisis are deeper than the technological or the economic ones

01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:23.160
I would say that they are co-informing co-influencing and that to really address it there are necessary

01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:28.680
things that have to happen across each of those areas and that sufficiency only happens across all

01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:34.920
of them and I won't belabor the point because we've written and talked about it we wrote a

01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:41.080
paper in the conciliance project called why technology is not values neutral

01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:51.000
and it's worth people looking at and it shows just a brief overview of the work of

01:19:52.040 --> 01:20:01.080
Marvin Harris and Marshall McLuhan and so many people in theory of technology of how

01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:07.960
technologies change the nature of mind and psychology individually and collectively the

01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:15.640
nature of culture in ways that are really subtle and not not obvious so I you know there's always

01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:26.040
this question of there's the what technologies the world develops and what social systems it

01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:31.000
develops are those the result of the consciousness and values of the people or the consciousness

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:35.000
and the values of the people who are born as babies being conditioned by the world that they're in

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:40.040
and the dominant systems and what things happen to be successful and if the worldview and the

01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:48.120
technology creates don't win a war it just gets wiped out and so I'm framing it this way because

01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:53.560
I think the deeper thing is actually really problematic it's you mentioned

01:20:54.280 --> 01:21:01.000
um Roger the reductionism one type of reductionism is to say there's only one thing the other type

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:05.160
is say there's a handful of things but my favorite thing is the most important one um

01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:13.720
and so being able to understand the co-arising and non-reduced process is actually really important

01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:22.680
um if I can introduce if I can introduce the concept here Daniel I find I have a neologism

01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:28.680
which is omnideterminism everything determines everything and I think that's what you're speaking

01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:39.240
to yeah um yeah I might more usually talk about omni influence that everything is influenced

01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:45.640
everything but not in a way that is absolutely deterministic because um nice refinement thank

01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:52.200
you there are things that are outside of hard determinism still that influence the net result

01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:58.440
of what happens also when we say omni we mean in the direction of all inclusive but we can never

01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:06.840
actually know we're being all inclusive um so in fact we can know for sure that we aren't being

01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:12.600
that's actually important um I can know for sure that I am not being all inclusive because

01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:24.120
computationally it would be impossible um so the framing of the metacrisis we often talk about

01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:32.920
involves like a frame I'll use often is um from Marvin Harris's work but to understand

01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:38.440
its civilization you can think of it in terms of these three areas its infrastructure its

01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:42.600
social structures and its superstructure its infrastructures all the technologies the whole

01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:49.080
tech stack and all the modes of material development and like that the social structures are all the

01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:54.760
collective agreement fields everything from the system of governance the law the institutions that

01:22:54.760 --> 01:23:01.400
mediate it and the superstructure is the religion the cultural ideology the values the definition

01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:08.040
of the good life so the the superstructure is kind of the spirituality psychology

01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:13.480
interiority of the people at the collective level and so of course we're always talking about that

01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:19.560
so I think seeing the top level frame of how all those fit together is worthwhile so if people

01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:27.000
haven't um I'll just reference talked about in a bunch of places a good friend Nate Hagins who's

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:33.160
very good thinker on um specifically the relationship between the environment and energy and the

01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:39.240
financial system he and I just did a five part series on his podcast and then the fourth part

01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:44.440
we do a kind of an overview of the metacrisis that covers this the third part unintentionally

01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:51.720
just because it came up we ended up covering how does one like emotionally psychologically and

01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:56.520
spiritually deal with the reality of the metacrisis given that there's so much to care about beyond

01:23:56.520 --> 01:24:00.200
what we feel like we have a sense of agency about those are ones that people might find

01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:04.520
interesting the fifth one we talk about frameworks to think through solutions

01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:11.400
competently so with all that prefacing I'll say some things here that I think maybe have not said

01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:20.760
as much other places that are relevant to what in the interiority of human psyches and experiences

01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:27.480
and cultures uh is a key or our key drivers of the problems of the world

01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:35.560
I want to mention how many things there are that we probably have no fucking clue about

01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:41.000
that are really critical just just to give a tiny couple examples

01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:47.080
we know that there are a lot of species that have gone extinct at somewhere between 100 and

01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:51.640
a thousand times the background rate of extinction since the industrial revolution as a result of

01:24:51.640 --> 01:25:01.080
human activity those species are not just in the world externally there is a similar biodiversity

01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:09.000
loss and species extinction in the microbiome of the human being and the microbiome of the human

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:13.640
being produces some of the necessary chemicals for us to work our genome doesn't actually produce

01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:18.920
all the things some aspects of the macrophage binding protein and various things like that

01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:26.840
are not adequately coated in the genome without a microbiome and and so extinction of some of

01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:32.520
those is pretty humongous it's like deleting chunks of our genome right and but if you start

01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:37.640
having ubiquitous antibiotics and chlorine in the water and pesticide exposure and all those types

01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:44.280
of things so how much when you realize that somewhere between 50 and 80 percent of the

01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:49.880
major mono and amine neurotransmitters like dopamine serotonin and gob are produced by the

01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:55.240
microbiome in the gut and that how you think how you perceive what you believe how happy you are

01:25:55.240 --> 01:26:00.840
what you your orientation towards violence will large to be or the result of that how much of

01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:06.840
what seems like a spiritual crisis in the world is the result of the effects of the unintended

01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:14.360
consequences of our kind of war on bacteria and biology and actually destroying part of the

01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:21.160
code set that makes us able to be us that's not something that people often would think of when

01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:27.640
they're thinking of the spiritual drivers of a thing but that is really important and if we

01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:34.760
you know if we look at the Anthropocene at the human built world there are so many aspects of

01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:38.680
the human built world that built a world we did not genetically evolve in we're not genetically

01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:47.000
adapted to that makes us misfit to our own being in important ways um obviously for the

01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:53.800
200,000 or 300,000 years of homo sapien history and the couple million years of hominin history

01:26:56.040 --> 01:27:01.720
we always lived in tribes there was no such thing as not living in tribes until extremely

01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:06.440
recently but we've been this way long enough that it seems like the nuclear family household

01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:09.720
was the most obvious thing and the only thing that could ever be and we can't really imagine

01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:15.080
anything else and yet it evolutionarily we evolved to fit in tribes so we so all the

01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:22.440
shit about attachment theory we we evolved to have attachment to like 150 people like strong

01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:30.200
attachments and where our life literally depended upon them we couldn't get our the the person who

01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:32.920
knows medicine it's the only person who knows medicine i'm not going to interact with other

01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:36.920
people so i can't just have a market opportunity to go to anybody so i actually need people and

01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:40.840
they need me so i can't be a shithead to them so i and everybody's going to see what everybody

01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:45.640
does so i can't lie and get away with it so like everything about psychology attachment theory

01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:52.440
bonding the ideas of codependence and interdependence we're totally different and we evolved in that

01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:58.280
setting right so then we get birth control and we're like oh sex doesn't have to equal reproduction

01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:03.080
anymore even though forever sex always equals possibility of reproduction we evolved to have

01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:06.760
our neural chemistry means sex equals the possibility of reproduction we put in birth

01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:11.960
control our neural chemistry and our evolutionary value didn't just change overnight but now we're

01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:16.680
acting in a way where it's like as if it doesn't mean that thing but a huge part of our whole

01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:22.520
being is responding that way so the reason i bring this up is if we were to try to comprehensively list

01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:25.640
all of the things

01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:31.880
that are conditioning our psyches in ways that they did not evolve

01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:39.560
to process and that are not optimal for us at an individual thriving a community thriving

01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:48.040
or a global thriving would be this podcast would take days um and so that's a big topic

01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:56.120
i just want to yes um if and i say that because if i say anything else first i'm

01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:03.960
concerned that people over norm on that as the thing and then again lose observation to all

01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:09.800
the things and complexity of all things so if i wanted to speak to something as the thing it would

01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:17.400
be the nature of mind that makes us lose orientation to the complexity and the interconnectivity of

01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:25.000
all the things um so if i if i was going to try to say what is the psychological generator function

01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:32.120
of the metacrisis one i think as good a way of saying it as i could is kind of

01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:40.920
not exactly the way david bone said it but it's derived from the way i heard him when he said the

01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:47.480
problems of the world result from a fragmented consciousness that sees the world as a bunch

01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:51.080
of parts and doesn't see the wholeness of things and he talked about wholeness in the

01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:56.440
implicate order and can we perceive through that wholeness and obviously we know he was a student

01:29:56.440 --> 01:30:00.840
of einstein's and einstein said it's an optical delusion of consciousness to believe there are

01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:06.200
separate things there is one thing that we call universe and that we have to work to develop our

01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:16.280
perception um so some of the problems in the world happen by be by intentionally advantaging

01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:21.240
some things at the expense of other things we know it'll cause an expense so we're advantaging

01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:29.080
our country at the expense of another country in a war which means our people our land our

01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:35.080
riches or whatever at the expense of that for those people um that obviously means we're able to

01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:41.080
separate the world enough to be able to think about this trade-off of good for these ones

01:30:42.040 --> 01:30:46.440
and even though we know it's bad for these ones okay because we separate the interconnectedness

01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:52.040
of everything and whether it's a country doing that to another country or in a relationship

01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:56.040
of a person doing that to another person thinking they can possibly win a fight and someone they

01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:59.480
love actually not get their needs met and that equals a good life for them somehow which is

01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:09.640
fucking ridiculous idea um uh or at the level of corporations or anything else or humans with

01:31:09.720 --> 01:31:13.400
regard to the biosphere or other animals we can advantage ourselves at their expense which

01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:19.560
obviously a factory farm and an uh uh industrial fishing fleet are not good for those animals

01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:23.480
are not good for the oceans are not good for the people working on them in poor conditions

01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:29.720
the other problems in the world is where we didn't know that we're causing the harm right so we can

01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:34.040
either benefit something at the expense of something else knowingly or we can benefit

01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:38.520
something at the harm of something else not knowing so conflict theory and mistake theory

01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:45.320
um and the real politic assessment of humans is the problems in the world are because we are

01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:51.720
dumb and nasty right like roughly if you want to make it very simple dumb is we cause problems

01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:56.840
that we didn't anticipate and nasty as we cause problems that we knew we're going to happen and

01:31:57.480 --> 01:32:02.440
so the how do we enlighten humans has to deal with both the dumb and nasty part right if we're

01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:07.720
talking if we're talking about how do we have the not not just how do you affect human behavior

01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:12.200
through different rewards and deterrents and social norms and systems of law but through people

01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:17.640
wanting something different having an internal motivational basis it would be can we expand

01:32:17.640 --> 01:32:24.920
the circle of care where they care about more that's the even the nasty part and can we expand the

01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:29.800
complexity of process where they can actually calculate their effects so that they are not

01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:35.880
unintentionally harming things more that's the deal with the dumb part um but similarly there if I'm

01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:37.960
thinking about

01:32:41.160 --> 01:32:46.280
co2 and how critical it is to get it down but I'm not thinking about ocean dead zones

01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:53.240
from nitrogen effluent using nitrogen fertilizer to grow more crops that will sequester more co2

01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:57.800
seems like a good idea even though it's going to cause this other externalized issue

01:32:58.360 --> 01:33:03.560
so again my ability to separate the ocean dead zones and the co2 is what's causing that unintentional

01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:09.320
right or thinking about that facebook will be some cool system for people being able to tag photos

01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:13.240
and get to know each other not thinking about what its effect on democracy will be with that particular

01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:24.840
ad model I would say all the problems look like people all the problems come from harm happening

01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:29.240
somewhere as a result of human choice but the choice was motivated by someone trying to benefit

01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:34.680
something so they're all based on tradeoffs so it's either I'm trying to benefit myself now at

01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:42.600
my own future expense addiction and compulsiveness I am uh so the parts conflict can even be within

01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:50.360
oneself right um I'm trying to benefit my people my religion my nation my political party whatever

01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:54.760
at the expense of the other one so great you get your political party elected you polarize the

01:33:54.760 --> 01:34:00.120
population worse next time they'll swing back harder and you're actually not progressing anything

01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:08.680
other than increasing polarization um or I am seeking to benefit things and the harm I'm

01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:13.160
causing elsewhere I just didn't know I didn't know that leachate was going to cause that pollution

01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:17.960
over there or whatever the other thing is so when bone was talking about the fragmented

01:34:17.960 --> 01:34:24.680
consciousness it was both at the level of aware of the connectedness and care about the connectedness

01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:34.360
and so really the key is seeing reality as parts right seeing reality as a bunch of separated parts

01:34:35.720 --> 01:34:41.080
leads to being able to care about a part and seek to advantage it in a way that causes harm to

01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:44.920
other things and then cascade effects of other agents doing this similar stuff and so you get

01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:50.760
cumulative harm effects and you get escalating arms races so not being able to perceive stuff as a

01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:55.080
bunch of separated parts but perceiving everything in relationship to everything else perceiving

01:34:55.080 --> 01:34:58.920
everything as a part of an interconnected whole where your ability to benefit that thing had to

01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:02.760
mean both caring about everything that it's connected to and being able to think through

01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:07.960
everything that's connected to come up with a strategy that is omnibeneficial or as close to

01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:13.000
that as possible and that where you made a mistake in it you're also ongoingly aware and working to

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:18.760
correct it I would say from the psychological perspective that's probably as deep a thing as

01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:25.480
we can say and even stuff like but aren't people wouldn't wouldn't we say impulsiveness and selfishness

01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:30.360
and addiction are even deeper than that because obviously all of the environmental harm is happening

01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:35.480
because people are buying too much shit to get a keep up with the Joneses or get a hit of something

01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:42.520
well it's still the same thing right like it's it is still the thing of that their future self is

01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:47.080
being harmed for their momentary self because their momentary self feels fucked up enough that it

01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:54.360
thinks that it means to get ahead of it so the parts conflict the the theory of tradeoff starts

01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:59.480
within the self between the parts of itself the Jungian parts reconciliation then would be the

01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:05.400
basis for being able to also have a wholeness of self in relationship with the wholeness of world

01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:08.840
um

01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:19.160
yeah let me let me um a couple of things uh given that and I've listened to you talk about these

01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:27.000
issues a lot and sometimes I'm just left with just oh we are so fucked you know but given that

01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:39.800
the solution of survivability as our current species on this our home seems to be ignorance

01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:48.200
and just uh being bad actors uh do you feel that enough of us that there's any kind of hope or

01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:54.760
sense that enough of us can evolve to a level where we can recognize this fractured and recognize

01:36:54.760 --> 01:37:01.000
what we're doing enough to keep us together as a human family connected to the whole so that we

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:04.920
can survive this this choke point in our evolutionary history

01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:18.680
I don't think there is much of a human family to keep together that is anything other than

01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:23.560
an abstract idea at this point that some people hold and many people don't even hold

01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:31.480
that's an ideal I think

01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:38.440
the question of is it possible

01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:50.920
to make it through the issues that the world is facing today the whole plurality of issues

01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:55.480
that are unprecedented historically because we hadn't had centuries of industrial tech bringing

01:37:55.480 --> 01:38:01.240
us up to planetary boundaries and we hadn't had exponential tech or even small number of actors

01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:04.600
could fuck everything up so quickly and we didn't have a world that had so much fragility

01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:13.080
given that we could have massive catastrophic harm from so many different vectors from synthetic

01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:19.080
bio created pandemics and from AI autonomous drone weapons and from climate change and from

01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:25.720
chemical planetary boundaries and from scaling war is there to make it through we have to avoid

01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:32.600
all of those to fail we only have to have any of them happen and our crack record doesn't look good

01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:40.680
right if you look back at the history of empires at all the history of war and environmental

01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:46.360
destruction is a pretty big part of that story we don't seem to be really noble stewards of power

01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:50.120
so as we're getting exponentially more power and we've usually used our power to

01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:57.160
do power games with each other meaning destroy each other and in ways that harm the environment

01:38:57.160 --> 01:39:03.080
is there any way that we can steward exponential power in a finite space I would say it takes a

01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:12.360
step function like it will take something significant that is more than just the continuation of

01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:15.560
whatever good aspects the enlightenment created or something like that

01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:23.800
in the huge shift after world war two it was a big shift we made a whole new world system

01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:25.720
but the answer was still

01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:33.080
extract more from nature even faster make more money and make more tech like it the

01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:39.960
Bretton Woods world system was a world system but in more increase for everybody was still a

01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:43.000
somewhat easier thing to do than when you're hitting planetary boundaries and you have to say

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:46.760
no we actually have to reduce consumption across everybody where a lot of people are like no I

01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:51.640
would rather not reduce my consumption go to war and have less people and I think I can win like

01:39:51.640 --> 01:39:57.000
this it's hard the situation we're in right now is unprecedented at a global level in such deep ways

01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:06.200
right so do I think it is possible to make it through I think the question is it possible to

01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:11.320
make it through without great harm doesn't even make sense because we're in species extinction

01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:16.520
and war today like great harm is happening today people are being killed in Ukraine people are

01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:20.840
being killed in Armenia and Azerbaijan people are being killed all over because of these issues

01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:30.440
and species are going extinct today so we're already in the great harm phase I almost know

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:36.520
adolescents don't have body dysmorphia in the Instagram etc world like that's

01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:44.040
so we're already in that right now do I think we can make it through without catastrophes

01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:49.880
where hundreds of millions of people die is one question do I think we can make it through where

01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:54.200
there are any humans left I think we make it through where there are humans and something

01:40:54.200 --> 01:41:00.920
that isn't just a totally scorched earth these are all different questions the answer

01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:08.680
can we make it through without the catastrophes intensifying no no no chance so so

01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:15.800
so given all this the the question comes up how then should we live given the truth of

01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:22.200
well this next part is critical can we make it through without the catastrophes intensifying

01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:27.800
no they're going to intensify because no matter what we do today there is no inactable path

01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:35.320
to preventing the extreme weather events that climate change alone is going to mediate there's

01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:40.040
a lot of things like that and then the human migration that's going to come from that we can

01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:46.840
if we do the very best things we can make it less bad but there is also no we there is no we that

01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:54.200
is a unified acting group right um the what china's interests are and what the us's interests are

01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:59.320
what the individual with the left and right within the us's interests are what the individual us people

01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:05.560
versus the elites in it they're not the same and so the whole like one of the biggest mistakes I made

01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:12.600
growing up was I always thought in this royal we that like humanity thoughtfully was all reading

01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:17.480
bucky's operating manual for spaceship earth and we're all you know thinking about un charters and

01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:21.640
looking at the earth and the astronauts perspective and carrying carl sagan's pale blue dot and of

01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:29.320
course we want to do the right and smart and good thing for everybody uh the thing that some people

01:42:29.320 --> 01:42:34.920
think is really good the other people think is really horrible and when you realize that

01:42:35.880 --> 01:42:43.880
the enactment gets really hard right is is the legality of abortion protecting women's freedoms

01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:52.840
and rights or is it murdering infants um you'll see the most severe uh ideological differences

01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:58.040
on what is good they create a basis for massive conflict and you see that across so many things

01:42:58.760 --> 01:43:07.320
right so um that's why I said there isn't a human family to hang together like that's

01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:15.960
that's an aspirational thing um do I think that if there is already a trajectory of some people who

01:43:15.960 --> 01:43:21.080
care about not just their own political party or their own nation or their own race or even

01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:25.560
their own species but care pretty considerably and are working in service of that that there are

01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:29.960
increasing number of people who have both more care more capacity and more interconnectivity

01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:34.280
and they cannot then also work with other people who maybe don't care about all of that but in

01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:38.840
increasingly good coordination for the things they do care about yes that's happening right

01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:45.960
there's a good thing in emergence that is happening do I think that that could be sufficient

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:54.200
to make it through without total extinction or scorched earth yes totally do I think it

01:43:54.200 --> 01:44:00.120
can make it through without the catastrophes intensifying no they will intensify before even

01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:08.440
on the best course do I think that it's a given that we make it through no which means we are no

01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:14.120
matter what in a phase of increasing intensity ahead and with I think both the what it takes to

01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:18.600
avoid all the catastrophes is deep enough change to the world systems that it's like that Bohmian

01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:24.120
thing that we are neither harming each other on purpose or accident which means a kind of

01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:29.000
more universal on the consideration or things like a human family is actually a real thing

01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:37.240
so I think in order to not have a get much worse changes have to happen at a deep enough

01:44:37.240 --> 01:44:41.320
level that it gets much better so I do think there's something like a pretty hard fork

01:44:42.680 --> 01:44:49.480
and I think it can go either way and I think it is not determined and I think it is increasingly

01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:55.480
potent and hard over the next while on in figuring that out so with that then the question how do

01:44:55.480 --> 01:45:05.320
we live as the frame is I can't imagine a context in which one's choices could matter more

01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:09.160
than that

01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:23.320
indeed it gives a whole another level and depth and dimension to

01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:31.000
the choices we make and the priorities we serve and the

01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:39.320
how we live our lives and offer our lives and so what what are some of the parameters for an

01:45:39.320 --> 01:45:42.840
effective contributing life that you see

01:45:43.000 --> 01:46:01.960
a few more resources that I'll offer here another short little blog I wrote on how to live a meaningful life

01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:08.600
which was intentionally not answering the question what is the meaning of life which we discussed

01:46:08.680 --> 01:46:13.480
earlier but it said had a meaningful life and it's just

01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:19.720
it's a way of talking about it there's lots of ways of talking about it that's not particularly

01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:26.360
better than lots of other ways but I there's something that is kind of comprehensive and

01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:33.800
kind of elegant about it so I'll offer it and it was looking at the mode of being

01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:41.000
the mode of doing and the mode of becoming all being relevant and defining all of them in terms

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:45.960
of beauty and that thing we said earlier that truth and goodness matter because beauty is

01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:55.400
so there it says the mode of being at its essence is about really deeply taking in the beauty of

01:46:55.400 --> 01:47:01.880
reality and appreciating it giving gratitude for it honoring and loving it you know all those things

01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:05.400
it's the essence of what the mode of being is really about

01:47:07.240 --> 01:47:13.400
and that the mode of doing is about being in service to the beauty of reality protecting

01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:20.040
it adding to it and the mode of becoming is deepening the capacity for being in doing

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:27.720
that I can appreciate ever more fully and that I can add to it ever more fully

01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:32.760
and that a meaningful life is a recursive relationship between those three

01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:40.120
and if what I'm doing isn't arising out of everything's fucked up so I have to fix everything

01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:45.800
but it's arising out of perceiving working on this hunger issue because we're perceiving the

01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:50.680
utter meaningfulness and beauty of these kids or these people in their life and the importance of

01:47:50.680 --> 01:47:57.560
it and the and so then the doing the desire to serve and protect arises not from the perception

01:47:57.560 --> 01:48:02.920
of all the badness but actually arises from the perception of the beauty from which the good

01:48:02.920 --> 01:48:08.600
which also means the bad is framed at all right so the thing that really is terrible and pisses us

01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:14.520
off is because something that is beautiful and sacred is being harmed which then brings us back

01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:19.400
to there's something that we actually love and have devotion to so we trace it back to that and say

01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:23.720
how do I be in service there so the doing must arise from the being

01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:31.720
and the becoming is I don't just want to perceive the beauty I currently see I want to perceive

01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:39.320
ever deeper dimensions of things that I had missed you know I want to ask what aspects of the

01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:44.520
of reality are important and beautiful that I'm missing that other people are noticing that I'm

01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:51.720
not honoring as fully as I could and then similarly with our doing where do I have frameworks for what

01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:57.400
I'm where is what I'm doing coming from ego and trauma and wounding where have I been running a

01:48:57.400 --> 01:49:02.120
strategy so long if I stopped and thought about it from scratch and I come up with something better

01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:12.120
you know like I want to be deepening the doing as well so I think if one relates to appreciating

01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:16.680
the beauty of life adding to it deepening the capacity for both that's a nice framework to start

01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:24.200
and then there was another resource but on there called Dharma inquiry which is more personal

01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:29.560
because that's obviously true for everybody the Dharma inquiry it's more into specific

01:49:30.200 --> 01:49:37.320
things one is bothered by and is inspired by and has aptitude at and is called to to have a sense of

01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:44.920
what is your unique relationship to that is your own Dharma with it I realized that

01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:50.920
there's something both very beautiful about the kind of bodhisattva direction and something

01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:57.640
that is incomplete about a certain direction of it I was I was incredibly influenced by

01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:03.560
the value of the bodhisattva and the may I become whatever is needed and

01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:11.400
when you look around and try to perceive what is needed and try to develop within yourself

01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:18.360
what can offer something there I remember the the first time I actually read it was in Alex Gray's

01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:24.920
art book the sacred mirrors and he had the heavy look page for the painting and then he had this

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:29.240
poem next to it it's so beautiful and it said something like where there is

01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:37.960
thirst may rain fall upon the people and may I myself become that rain or there is hunger may

01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:41.560
I be transformed into the food but near them where there is illness may I become the medicine

01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:50.200
you know wherever there is need of any kind may I become what is needed I think that helps one to

01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:55.080
recognize that what they love is deeper to who they are than who they think they are

01:50:56.440 --> 01:51:01.560
beautiful because I think I like these things and I don't like these things I'm good at these

01:51:01.560 --> 01:51:08.280
things not these things but oh I can't help with that because I'm not a legal scholar or I'm not

01:51:08.280 --> 01:51:12.520
a construction worker or I'm not a whatever it is and yeah it's like but if that's the thing

01:51:12.520 --> 01:51:18.600
that is most needed and would help what you care about most can you can you become something that

01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:23.800
you are not and I've had many times where there was something that I was not good at that I actually

01:51:23.800 --> 01:51:29.080
really identified as a thing I would never want to be good at and realized that it actually

01:51:29.080 --> 01:51:33.560
mattered what I cared about enough that if I held that limited identity I was not in maximum

01:51:33.560 --> 01:51:39.080
service to what I claimed to care about and I had to get like well I I care about what I care about

01:51:39.080 --> 01:51:46.040
so long as it fits with my identity easily or I've got to transcend the identity so that's

01:51:46.040 --> 01:51:50.840
what I like about the vow of the bodhisattva but where it's missing something is

01:51:53.480 --> 01:51:59.480
I really am not equally good at all the things that are needed nor can I do all of the things

01:51:59.480 --> 01:52:07.640
even if I try there's a lot of people have to do all the things so if medicine work is needed and if

01:52:07.640 --> 01:52:12.360
economics change is needed and if care of the individual people and animals is needed as well

01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:20.120
as macro systemic thinking about systems to do that not only what is most needed but what is most

01:52:20.120 --> 01:52:27.480
needed that my being is well developed to be able to be in service to is important and so the

01:52:27.480 --> 01:52:34.680
Dharma questions are trying to help hone that for people. Beautiful and and you're pointing to

01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:42.200
the kinds of questions we need to ask ourselves in order to in order to orient ourselves

01:52:42.200 --> 01:52:48.200
to be most effective instruments of service or for the and in the bodhisattva aspiration for

01:52:48.200 --> 01:52:54.280
the welfare and awakening of all and I really think that probably that bodhisattva aspiration

01:52:54.280 --> 01:53:00.840
may be one of the highest ideals in mind as human mind has ever come up with and such a beautiful

01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:05.800
thing and you're pointing now to the questions we ask which the first question that emerges is

01:53:05.800 --> 01:53:11.640
well what what can I do but then you're pointing to the idea that there's a there are questions

01:53:11.640 --> 01:53:20.200
deeper than that what's the most effective thing I can do and along with that the question or the

01:53:20.200 --> 01:53:29.720
colon actually what am I called to do and deeper still in your implication is is a question how

01:53:29.720 --> 01:53:36.440
can I live my life so as to be an optimal instrument of service and each of those is I think better

01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:43.000
thought of as a as a colon or a wisdom question and I would draw the distinction saying a conceptual

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:48.600
question is you know is it raining outside take a look no end of question but wisdom questions are

01:53:48.600 --> 01:53:52.200
more like columns every time you ask them they have the potential for taking you deeper into the

01:53:52.200 --> 01:53:58.520
question deeper into life deeper into yourself and so you're pointing us towards the real the

01:53:58.520 --> 01:54:04.680
wisdom questions of our time. I would also say that almost every value or principle

01:54:06.520 --> 01:54:14.040
lives in a dialectical relationship with another value or principle that is complementary but

01:54:14.040 --> 01:54:21.320
they might seem almost opposite and that without holding them together the full version of just

01:54:21.320 --> 01:54:28.600
that one thing the reducto ad absurdum of it actually becomes evil and so this is the everything

01:54:28.680 --> 01:54:38.280
can be a medicine or everything can be a poison topic so what is

01:54:41.240 --> 01:54:48.120
what is my unique self calling what is that which I can offer the world based on the unique

01:54:48.120 --> 01:54:54.360
set of experiences and capacities I have that no one else could offer that if I spend my life doing

01:54:54.360 --> 01:55:00.440
things other than that that other people could do the most novel offering that I have doesn't occur

01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:06.040
that's a deep and important and beautiful question but taken to its extreme it'll make

01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:11.560
you a total shithead because fucking do the dishes when you need to do the dishes no it's not your

01:55:11.560 --> 01:55:16.360
unique self the only thing that you can do like anybody can do the dishes or take out the trash

01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:23.640
but like damn though a lot of life is just doing the dishes out of the trash and maybe the unique

01:55:23.640 --> 01:55:31.720
self that you have is is unexpressible infinitesimal qualities with which you show up to those things

01:55:31.720 --> 01:55:41.720
you know so the what is uniquely mine to do that no one else can do and what fucking needs done

01:55:41.720 --> 01:55:46.600
that nobody wants to do I'll just show up to you got to hold those together right because also on

01:55:46.600 --> 01:55:50.920
the other side if you always just say what is nobody what is the shittiest job that nobody

01:55:50.920 --> 01:55:55.640
wants to do let me show up to that which is an incredibly ennobling question incredibly beautiful

01:55:55.640 --> 01:56:06.520
question you can also end up uh failing at some unique self darmism capacities you could have

01:56:06.520 --> 01:56:17.720
because of only orienting that way and so uh every every principle and every virtue needs held in a

01:56:17.720 --> 01:56:24.120
dialectical relationship and not over normed as absolute yeah and this is the ancient concept

01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:31.880
of the interdependence of virtues that that they require require each other and complement one

01:56:31.880 --> 01:56:37.560
one another and I think you're also pointing to the contextual nature of our inquiries that we

01:56:37.560 --> 01:56:46.360
have to keep the context as well so again beautiful beautiful reflections and deepening and expanding

01:56:46.680 --> 01:56:52.520
uh that I see you're pointing us to yeah and I've I've just felt that we've been spending

01:56:53.400 --> 01:56:57.800
I don't know extra amount of time in the heart of philosophy and I feel a connection with

01:56:57.800 --> 01:57:03.800
fidgety triathlons and all of that stuff has started long ago in another land and it's still

01:57:04.760 --> 01:57:14.040
it's still churning and a universe that can produce um a you and a me I can't be all bad

01:57:14.040 --> 01:57:24.200
and I feel deeply moved and deeply uh renewed in my commitment to do my little things you know

01:57:24.200 --> 01:57:29.720
whatever that calling might be and I think I pretty much found that but also to shampoo my dog

01:57:29.720 --> 01:57:36.200
and take out the trash and you know wipe the counters and that sort of thing you know and

01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:41.160
you say it can't be all bad it's funny because so I focus on the meta crisis which is like all the

01:57:41.160 --> 01:57:45.800
most fucked up stuff that could be all together um it kind of seems like that but it's not really

01:57:45.800 --> 01:58:01.000
what I focus on I mean it's in appreciation and love of this world and life there's the desire to

01:58:02.200 --> 01:58:07.880
protect it and uh so paying attention to things that need protecting but where does the motivation

01:58:07.960 --> 01:58:11.720
come from the motivation doesn't come things being fucked up the motivation comes from the

01:58:12.520 --> 01:58:21.560
wonder of it right from the beauty of it like I've had I know you you both talk about bringing

01:58:21.560 --> 01:58:28.040
the philosophic concepts into daily practice on this um show a lot and you know I've had a lot of

01:58:28.040 --> 01:58:33.880
practices throughout my life in terms of types of meditation types of inquiry and whatever

01:58:34.840 --> 01:58:40.920
but like I wake up in the morning and the first thing I do pretty much every morning is I just

01:58:40.920 --> 01:58:45.400
look out the window at the trees and I just watch the trees move in the wind for a little bit

01:58:46.760 --> 01:58:54.440
and I don't I don't have to try to care about them or try to find them beautiful they're just

01:58:54.440 --> 01:58:59.400
fucking beautiful and there's a happiness that comes just watching that and then there's a

01:58:59.400 --> 01:59:04.440
gratitude to be alive and consciousness you know arising again and there's a happiness to be on this

01:59:04.440 --> 01:59:10.760
planet and then there is a because of the happiness it comes from just the perception of the beauty

01:59:10.760 --> 01:59:15.640
of it I don't need that much for myself right there's not an unhappiness it needs me to do a

01:59:15.640 --> 01:59:22.520
bunch of stuff and then there's this gratitude that I like I was sleeping this con this Daniel

01:59:22.520 --> 01:59:27.640
consciousness wasn't here and then it boots again and now it's here and I think about when Daniel's

01:59:27.640 --> 01:59:35.080
dead the consciousness that will be perceiving the world and falling in love for the first time and

01:59:35.080 --> 01:59:40.440
climbing trees and reading hafez and rumi for the first time it's all the things and I can't

01:59:40.440 --> 01:59:45.480
not feel connected to those consciousnesses a hundred and a thousand years from it like I can't

01:59:45.480 --> 01:59:51.560
not feel what it feels like to perceive through those eyes and I'm actually not trying to get it

01:59:51.560 --> 01:59:59.160
to go anywhere I just want that kids get to keep experiencing falling in love with trees for the

01:59:59.160 --> 02:00:02.920
first time and mothers get to keep falling in love with their kids and people get to fall in love and do

02:00:04.520 --> 02:00:10.360
poetry for the first time and get heartbroken and all the things the pot like it is intrinsically

02:00:10.360 --> 02:00:18.040
already meaningful without going anywhere and it's already beautiful and you know one of the other

02:00:18.040 --> 02:00:22.280
things I know you'll have talked about is peak experiences and one of the things I always felt is

02:00:24.920 --> 02:00:26.520
once you have had one of them

02:00:31.160 --> 02:00:37.640
like for me I remember I remember discreetly I've talked about before there was this one time I

02:00:37.640 --> 02:00:44.200
was watching a sunset and writing poetry to nature and watching a sunset as a teenager

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:49.960
and I remember the sunset was just so incredibly beautiful and I remember thinking

02:00:51.480 --> 02:00:56.040
if I had the choice if there is a spirit before this life if I had the choice to come here and

02:00:56.040 --> 02:00:59.800
incarnate and go through whatever painful things that I've went through my whole life just to get

02:00:59.800 --> 02:01:07.480
to have this one experience of color and vision and the wind and the insects in this moment would

02:01:07.480 --> 02:01:12.600
totally do it like I would take every pain in my whole life to have had this experience as opposed to

02:01:12.600 --> 02:01:20.920
no experience and then I'm like I've had that I've had so many of these experiences and one of

02:01:20.920 --> 02:01:27.640
them is worth incarnating for I've had so many of them and so it's like the fact that I will probably

02:01:27.640 --> 02:01:34.440
have more of them is gravy and it's like a ridiculous beauty and abundance but that every

02:01:34.440 --> 02:01:38.360
that future life gets to keep having those and that other people get to have more of those is kind

02:01:38.360 --> 02:01:46.200
of more what I'm motivated by and they make us better persons when we experience those things

02:01:46.200 --> 02:01:53.720
that it shifts you know something happens maybe just a little bit but something happens in a

02:01:53.720 --> 02:01:59.000
positive thing and shifts in our soul and our interiors and maybe we behave a little a little

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:04.200
better or a lot better I'm not sure I think the what's in it for me thing chills out

02:02:04.200 --> 02:02:10.760
you know and it's not that it doesn't reboot because we're complex people with lots of parts

02:02:10.760 --> 02:02:15.640
and there will be a pain body that reboots and so it's not like enlightenment is a static thing

02:02:15.640 --> 02:02:20.920
and you have a satori and then you never have a pain body boot again it does but there's something

02:02:20.920 --> 02:02:29.080
about even just thinking about it and just being like I there could have been no I no experience at

02:02:29.080 --> 02:02:35.720
all and there's experience and there've been such amazing ones and

02:02:39.880 --> 02:02:44.840
and and I feel this pretty much with every difficulty or trauma too is like when you've

02:02:44.840 --> 02:02:50.440
done the healing work with it you don't still feel messed up by the trauma or the pain but you do feel

02:02:51.240 --> 02:02:58.760
ongoingly benefited by the lessons and it's kind of like a lot of people don't have the

02:02:58.760 --> 02:03:02.520
resources or know how to do the healing so they never get the lessons and they're just always

02:03:02.520 --> 02:03:07.400
affected by the pain and that's a bummer but if one kind of has the resources knows how to work

02:03:07.400 --> 02:03:13.080
on it then the pain is temporary and the gifts are lasting and it's like this just beneficial

02:03:13.080 --> 02:03:18.760
asymmetry like this beautiful asymmetry where it's like yeah I just am a yes to the whole thing

02:03:18.760 --> 02:03:26.120
let's say yes to the whole thing and there's there's a beautiful couple of lines that came out of

02:03:26.120 --> 02:03:33.160
San Quentin prison uh there's a project uh grip guiding rage into pain which uh the people work

02:03:33.160 --> 02:03:39.240
very intensely with with people many of them life as many of them have been murderers and

02:03:40.040 --> 02:03:44.920
work on life transformation their ideals the body sight for aspiration the commitment is

02:03:45.480 --> 02:03:50.840
even if I stay in my in the prison for the rest of my life I'm going to do what I can to help people

02:03:51.640 --> 02:03:58.840
and one and one of them after after and there's a very intensive exploration of their pain and

02:03:58.840 --> 02:04:04.920
the trauma they've both caused and received and these are very traumatized people and there's a

02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:11.320
video of one of these sessions in which one of the one of the prisoners some suddenly lights out

02:04:11.320 --> 02:04:17.720
lights up and says oh I get it hurt people hurt people and healed people heal people

02:04:18.600 --> 02:04:25.960
it's like oh oh it's so beautiful yeah they're both self-propagating

02:04:27.480 --> 02:04:36.200
yeah I would love to explore that with you Daniel uh we've gone long and far and deep or maybe that's

02:04:36.200 --> 02:04:41.720
the wrong word uh to explore the the darkness and the addiction and the way out of that and just

02:04:41.720 --> 02:04:48.440
what you said um Roger uh hurt people hurt people and heal people heal people and that's uh

02:04:49.480 --> 02:04:56.360
maybe that's a good place to wrap it uh for this evening I really enjoyed the conversation with

02:04:56.360 --> 02:05:02.600
both of you I think that the this podcast where you're exploring these topics and sharing it with

02:05:02.600 --> 02:05:10.680
people is uh a really beautiful service and I'm honored to be here with you oh it's such a delight

02:05:10.680 --> 02:05:17.400
Daniel and it's such a such a gift to be able to investigate at this depth and co-explore so

02:05:18.040 --> 02:05:25.080
thank you so much for this gift to to everyone who listens to the podcast and thank you so much

02:05:25.080 --> 02:05:30.520
for your life's work it's truly a gift crisis we get to share this with thousands and thousands

02:05:30.520 --> 02:05:35.480
of god knows how many people that's tremendous that's just tremendous if there is a second time

02:05:35.480 --> 02:05:42.280
we come back to and explore that hurt people hurt people that there is some

02:05:43.720 --> 02:05:50.200
autopoetic trauma force almost and that there is also some kind of autopoetic healing or integrative

02:05:50.200 --> 02:05:54.600
force but if you wanted to think of the light and dark sides of the force that's actually kind of a

02:05:54.600 --> 02:06:01.880
good way of thinking of it is the autopropagation of those things um and we wanted to explore that

02:06:01.880 --> 02:06:08.280
sometime maybe also if the listeners have thoughts or questions or topics coming from this that can

02:06:08.280 --> 02:06:15.560
inform it we can get to those next time too right well we hereby extend an invitation to

02:06:15.560 --> 02:06:21.320
listeners to let us know the questions you have for Daniel and uh I think you're implicitly

02:06:21.320 --> 02:06:26.120
suggesting you're open to coming back and we of course would love that and I know how listeners

02:06:26.120 --> 02:06:32.440
would too so that's beautiful and again in regards to your father and mom if they're still

02:06:32.440 --> 02:06:37.400
on this plane and if not in regards to them anyway okay tell tell them they they deeply

02:06:37.400 --> 02:06:43.160
touch one old guy in Louisiana made a difference for him I'll send this podcast to them when it

02:06:43.160 --> 02:07:00.200
publishes Daniel thank you so much take care
