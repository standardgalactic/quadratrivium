0	14000	Welcome to Deep Transformation, Self-Society Spirit.
14000	17600	I'm Roger Walsh, and our co-host is John DePuy.
17600	23160	And with us today is a guest that I'm just delighted to be in dialogue with.
23160	29960	This is Daniel Schmacktenberger, one of the most incisive, integrative, and brilliant
29960	32880	thinkers about the great issues of our time.
32880	39560	Daniel's a polymath who has ranged across a wide variety of disciplines and has a prodigious
39560	47360	amount of information about multiple areas, topics, issues, concerns, and intellectual
47360	54440	disciplines, but not only a wide array of information, a remarkable degree of information
54440	60840	and integration, pulling topics together, synthesizing them in novel ways, and coming
60840	67760	up with creative innovations and ideas and synthesis.
67760	75640	He is able to and has been giving us a wide array of insights into the great issues of
75640	76640	our time.
76640	82120	And if you've searched the internet, you've probably run across Daniel and the many dialogues
82120	88160	he's had about the metacrisis, the term that's currently used for some total of our social
88160	90520	and global issues.
90520	98240	But what you haven't seen or heard of, Daniel, is his spiritual dimensions and the ways in
98240	104840	which those have touched his understanding of life and our current temporary concerns.
104840	110600	So we were really delighted, given that Deep Transformation is about transformation not
110640	116840	only of self and society, but also of spirit, when Daniel suggested that in our discussion
116840	121480	of the metacrisis, we focused specifically on the spiritual dimensions, which he said
121480	124120	he doesn't often get a chance to talk about.
124120	128720	And so we are just very happy to have this opportunity.
128720	135200	Daniel, so many people know you as someone, as a brilliant intellectual who has thought
135200	142280	deep and hard and synthetically and novelly about these great issues.
142280	147320	But you also have a deep commitment to self exploration, self actualization, spiritual
147320	149520	practice.
149520	156480	What would you like to share about that side of yourself?
157480	167240	First, thanks for having me here, it's good to be with you both and all the people engaging
167240	171200	in the podcast.
171200	179040	When it comes to the spiritual dimensions, and we'll probably want to unpack what we
179040	185440	even mean by spiritual sense, it is a pretty unprecise term often.
185440	196880	But the psychological, interior, sacred, whatever dimensions of the state of our world, I would
196880	198880	love to be in that conversation together.
198880	203080	I don't have a preset set of things to talk about on it, because as you mentioned, it's
203080	213680	not the thing I talk about all the time, but obviously very interesting.
213680	218600	I was fortunate in my growing up to get to study a lot of the people that might be called
218600	224480	great polymaths throughout history, so I have a heap of respect for them and I've tried
224480	231600	to learn what I can, I would not describe myself that way.
231600	237440	I think the connection is I would describe myself as being deeply interested in lots of
237440	246200	things, and I find that what people are interested in and what they find meaningful, and at the
246200	249800	heart of that what they find sacred are usually connected, though they might not be explicitly
249800	256520	aware, and the things that people are interested in and enough, they often develop some capacity
256640	268200	at, and if someone has some sense of the wholeness of reality, as opposed to when we think in
268200	277080	different disciplines, here's where biology starts and chemistry stops or physics or whatever,
277080	280640	those are ways we take the complexity of the world and try to divide it to make subjects
280640	285800	and make it easier to study, but those divisions don't exist in reality in that way.
286080	292720	So if we have some sense of just the integrated wholeness of reality and we're kind of interested in it,
292720	298720	there's some sense that reality itself is sacred, then there would be nothing that isn't interesting.
298720	306720	It's like, if you're really in love with your partner, what aspect of their being is uninteresting to you?
306720	311640	It's a weird proposition to say, oh, I don't give a shit what she thinks about, or her
311720	317960	talk books on fashion or whatever it is, and it's such a superficial place to be, because even if you
317960	322520	didn't think you cared about that topic on your own, if you really care about this being and this
322520	326920	being cares about it, work to understand why they care about it, because there's some part of their
326920	332840	being you're missing, if the fascination they have, if the care, if the love doesn't translate to,
334360	340760	and so if you get that, you're like, well, whatever, every aspect of them I'm interested in,
340760	345000	because part of love is the desire to know, because what does it mean that I love somebody if I don't
345000	353880	really know who they are? And if I have some love for reality, then wanting to know it more is
353880	358680	one of the things, right, wanting to appreciate it more wanting to be in more service to it,
358680	365720	and those are all just kind of natural byproducts. And so relatively young,
366680	375000	I had the insight that everything was interesting, that the things that I thought weren't interesting,
375000	379400	because at first I didn't think that, but the things I thought weren't interesting was just
379400	387000	because I didn't get them, I didn't understand why anyone else found it interesting, and if I
387000	390280	tuned in empathetically enough to them, and I could see it, I'm like, oh, there's a whole
390280	394840	dimension of meaningfulness and beauty and parts of the nature of reality that I'm just missing,
394920	404920	and when Gibran said it's in, it was in meditation upon the dew drop that I discovered the mysteries
404920	410520	of the ocean, right, the kind of poetic way to speak to the fractal nature or the as without so
410520	417160	within, when there is some understanding of the integratedness of reality, a deep insight about
417160	423240	anything also gives you some insight about everything else. And one of the places that I
423480	429640	most insight was taking some principle in thermodynamics and applying it to gardening,
429640	434680	or some principle in evolutionary theory and applying it to relationships or whatever,
434680	439720	getting that like those theories were ways of understanding the universe, but all of them
439720	443720	gave different insights, looking at the world through a thermodynamics lens versus an evolutionary
443720	448520	psych lens versus a complexity theory lens gave different insights on the same reality.
449400	452840	So if I could take those insights and apply them to lots of things and apply lots of different
452840	457560	ones, just got to see more multi-dimensionally. I mean, one of the projects we launched called
457560	461320	the conciliance project, and that's what the word conciliance means is the more
462200	467560	perspectives one can take on the thing, the more depth and richness of information they can get
467560	475240	about it. So, and I think, you know, the the metacrisis, this area of study of like,
476200	482120	what are all the problems of the world is really like came from a childhood inquiry of
484200	490360	what is worth doing. And there were so many things that were worth doing. And I became
491400	497080	kind of clear that when you focus on one, one, I just couldn't leave some of the areas out,
497960	503320	right? Like, it was just, I don't know how many people have this experience, some for sure.
504280	508200	But when I would think about really focusing on factory farms or really focusing on
510920	515080	the issue of how many dogs and cats are getting put to sleep every year or clear cutting or whatever
515080	522200	it was, the idea that I was not focusing on the other things just wrecked me. And then getting
522200	526680	to see that there were so many groups focusing on those things, and yet so many of those things
526680	530760	collectively were getting worse, not better. And I was wondering, do we just need more effort in
530760	535800	these areas? Or is there something about the nature of the effort that is that is off?
537080	541160	And the answer is both. But there was definitely something about, and people have heard me talk
541160	545640	other places, the way we solve problems causes other problems almost all the time, because we
545640	549960	define the problem too narrowly, we create a first order solution that the technology or a law or
549960	554920	business or whatever to solve it. But that's connected to a complex set of things, and it
554920	559800	produces second and third order effects somewhere else. So the dam to bring electricity to poor
559800	564120	people to solve the poverty issue might extinct a bunch of species downriver from the dam that
564120	573000	just got flooded or whatever in this, a million examples of this. So there's a, it actually became
573000	580280	clear that the study of the issues in the world and the siloing of the issues in the world was
580280	585240	a part of the problem itself, why we weren't solving them in a way that Bohm talked about very
585240	593880	well, David Bohm. And so the, like what is worth caring about everything, you know, how it fits
593880	598680	together, what is worth studying is kind of everything. The study is for itself, it's pure
598680	603400	knowledge of just the intimacy with universes intrinsically interesting. And it's also has
603400	610200	utility, it can increase the capacity to be of service to. Those are some initial thoughts.
611160	617960	And Daniel, did you, was there a point as a young man or a teenager, you began as you were
617960	621640	kind of chewing on all this and seeing it was that starting to emerge as a calling
622200	628760	for you that maybe that was your path to start connecting the dots and seeing how these things
628760	632200	mattered? I think
639640	645880	I think most people when they're young are enculturated in a particular way about who they are
645880	651640	and what life is about and what they should pursue. And then some of them continue on that path,
651640	657320	some of them recognize that their parents idea of what they're calling should be or their culture's
657320	668120	idea is not their own and then they have kind of this path change. I've had lots of path
668120	679480	refinements. I have had times of deep study in esoteric metaphysics and hardcore reductionist
679480	684120	atheism, you know, like any young person who's trying to be intellectually congruent and make
684120	690040	sense of stuff and not miss stuff. But they had the same spirit to them, which is funny, right?
690040	694040	They had the same spirit, which was like, and you can't even put words to it because you can
694040	698200	say it's what is true, but it's also kind of what is good, what is meaningful, what is beautiful,
698200	708120	and you know, something like that. But I think I was pretty fortunate in a way that some other,
708120	712920	but not lots of other people were in terms of early childhood exposure to the topic of what is my
712920	720920	path is that I had parents that were putting that question as the forefront of my education
720920	729480	since I was born. And so that's a pretty fortunate thing. And I went to school a few times mostly
730280	734680	my parents were interested in me getting some socialization, but I was mostly home school.
735800	742120	And they were interested in running a kind of educational experiment. And they were not
742120	746440	educational philosophers in any formally trained sense, they hadn't read Dewey and Montessori and
747000	751960	Steiner, they just had their own kind of intuitions about it. But some really good intuitions.
752840	757880	But the sense was rather than have a curriculum based thing have some sense of trust that the
759800	764920	kids innate curiosities if facilitated will orient them in the right direction. So it's kind
764920	771800	of constructivist. And so we had a homeschool that had no curriculum at all. And there are a few
771800	777560	places where this was significantly disadvantageous because like it wasn't till I was an adult and
777560	783320	paying attention to spell checker that I learned how to spell. It's very fortunate. I didn't do enough
783320	788840	of the like writing letters penmanship to actually have refined the fine motor skills enough to have
788840	794120	legible handwriting. I didn't get it and then let it devolve because of busyness like some doctors,
794120	800840	I just never even got decent penmanship. It was a good thing I can type. There were whole areas of
800920	805240	like American history and things that were actually important that I just didn't know were
805240	809160	important and I just had none of them. But then there were some areas that I got to study way
809160	813320	more deeply than people normally would have at those times. But because I was studying things
813320	818200	I was interested in, I doubled down on interest, right? And I think one of the things that happens
818200	823160	for a kid is when you don't facilitate their interests because you don't know how, which
823160	828600	so often the kids are asking questions and the parents just don't know the answers. I give these
828600	835320	examples a lot because they come up all the time when a kid asks why is the sky blue or why is fire
835320	842920	hot. You have to understand many layers of physics but then also neuroscience and then also the
842920	848840	philosophy of mind to be able to translate the subjective experience of hotness from sensations
848840	855160	that happen on the skin and what is communicated between cells and in the nervous system to what
855160	860520	is the thermodynamics of fire or the nature of the molecules in the upper atmosphere that create
860520	867000	blueness in the visual optical spectrum. Those questions, if every kid asks stuff like that
867000	870440	and if you know how to facilitate the interest, they end up learning everything from theory of
870440	879400	mind to philosophy of science to, you know, atmospherics and neurobiology. But if you don't
879400	884040	facilitate the things they're interested in and you force them to do shit that they're not interested
884120	889320	in, it can break their interest and then they become a little bit more focused on quick hits of
890040	898360	dopaminergic interest rather than deep learning. So I had that fortune but the other fortune other
898360	901960	than just kind of just hiding my own curriculum is because a kid will largely be interested in
901960	906600	things based on what they're exposed to and how they're exposed. I don't find that there are any
906600	911880	kids who aren't interested in math who had amazing math teachers or who weren't interested in art who
911880	915800	had amazing art teachers or history. So how they're exposed, what they're exposed to. And so
916440	920600	what my parents were interested in had a lot to do with what I was interested in, of course,
920600	925000	right? This is one of the limits of constructivism is, you know, what the reality of what the
925000	930520	kid is exposed to. But again, I feel like I lucked out in terms of their interest being things were
931560	937160	a pretty good set of things. So my, my parents were reading Buckminster Fuller and kind of design
937160	942360	science and they were reading David Bowman, Krishnamurti, they were reading kind of Vedanta
942360	947480	and Eastern philosophy for Choff Capra and the kind of emerging systems theory in the early 80s and
949160	954360	and they also the thought that there's no reason bedtime kids bedtime stories for kids when their
954360	960040	infants need to be Dr. Seuss as opposed to synergetics by Bucking Fuller because kids learning
960040	967080	language no matter what. And so those were like my primitive concepts and included in those were
967160	972920	the core existential questions of what are we, what are we here for? What is this all about?
972920	977880	And then the people using kind of the most advanced frameworks of the time like systems theory and
977880	983480	design science to think about how do we go about making a better world and like that. So I never
983480	991720	really had to find my way to that. That was kind of the default setting. I had to find and upon
991720	994760	further inquiry of like, was that a wrong default setting? Should I just
997560	1002360	just make money or make art or something else? Like no, that didn't, that ended up continuing to be
1002920	1011960	roughly right direction, but trying to more competently answer how to understand the issues
1011960	1015240	of the world and how to be of service to them. It's a lot of content refinement.
1016120	1025400	Daniel, so you had an unusually broad self-directed education, but there's also
1025400	1031480	something else that's quite distinctive about your thinking and that is a rare degree of integration.
1032280	1034600	And how did you develop that?
1034920	1046680	I have friends who are developmental theorists who, Zach Stein, who I work with closely and
1046680	1052680	many others, who will talk about how there is an increase in the type of
1055560	1061160	complexity of what someone can process, the way they notice changes in context for processing
1061240	1065560	the same content the way they can seek and shift perspectives and then integrate them. And I think
1065560	1070120	there's a lot true and important there. I have other friends who are critics of developmental
1070120	1076440	theory because they say there's a lot of societal normative assumptions based on how people are
1076440	1080440	kind of ubiquitously trained that in a different society with different childhood development
1080440	1091720	would go differently. So for instance, if kids are being taught in school, this is math, this is
1091720	1096600	social studies, this is history, this is biology, and they're being taught a compartmentalized
1096600	1100840	universe where they're never asked how the social science is being influenced by the biology or
1100840	1106280	vice versa or how the principles co-apply, they're getting a non-integrated fragmented world
1106520	1111480	given to them and actually behaviorally trained up on thinking that way. They're not being given
1111480	1115560	any kind of integrated framework, so then we get excited when someone becomes an integrative thinker
1115560	1122120	later because it was trained out of everybody. I don't think it is actually necessary that people
1122120	1131720	learn that way. I think it's not even the case in say, pre-industrialized education, it just wasn't
1132680	1141560	even the case in the same way. And so because my education was self-directed, it also didn't have
1141560	1148120	clear delineations of topics. I was never doing math or social studies. I was doing an inquiry
1148120	1151960	about something that was interesting that might have involved some math and some, you know,
1151960	1159320	quite a few things. So if you're trying to understand integrative things like how does a
1159320	1165480	body self-organize? How does a fetus actually develop? How does that? Then you're having to
1165480	1172520	intrinsically be radically interdisciplinary. What is worth doing in the world and how do we know?
1173800	1178920	So I think the most interesting questions are at a high enough level of abstraction that to address
1178920	1184680	them well, there's the taxonomy of questions beneath them is very interdisciplinary and you
1184680	1192840	actually have to bridge across them. So I do think a totally different educational paradigm
1192840	1199960	could have analysis and synthesis or integration on a knowledge that happening simultaneously
1199960	1208840	at each level of complexity. Yeah. And pulling together some of the things you've said,
1208840	1215960	you've spoken to your education, you've spoken to the natural integrative thinking that emerges
1215960	1223640	from a problem-solving approach to education as opposed to a compartmentalized scholastic
1223640	1232760	disciplinary approach. But also underlying this was sounds like a real desire for an
1232760	1240200	appreciation of the whole and a desire to optimize service. And it seems like what I'm
1240200	1248920	hearing is that those two things led you to this in big picture integrative approach to
1248920	1256680	understanding and responding to the great issues of our time. Yeah, I'll share a few other things
1256680	1260840	that I think were significant influences that I'm grateful for and that I think are interesting
1260840	1270760	for everybody to look at is... I think there's a good bit of evidence that the
1272680	1277800	people that many of us find to be some of the greatest exemplars of human potential
1278680	1283720	were the result of developmental paths that are more accessible to everyone than lots of people
1283720	1295000	or think. Not just some weird genetic or situational anomaly. And I'm not saying that genetics plays
1295000	1299000	no role in aptitude, of course it does. The height is a real thing that's going to affect
1299000	1305880	aptitude, size, whatever, and maybe does it do that for neural connectivity? Sure. But
1306040	1317480	I believe his name is Eric Hoel, who was an academic who started a very interesting blog recently,
1319160	1323240	published this article that then has gotten a lot of traction and debate around where
1323240	1328840	of all the super genius has gone. And it's a resource I think is really interesting and worth
1328840	1333640	people paying attention to. Of course, there are problems with what we think of as super genius
1333640	1339240	because might a aboriginal tracker who doesn't solve Rubik's cubes particularly well or do the
1339240	1343480	normal IQ things be a super genius in a totally different set of dimensions on things we can't
1343480	1353000	even perceive with our normal cognitive science kind of models, sure. But if we just take what
1353000	1362520	he was meaning here, he was saying it seems that the Isaac Newton's and Einstein's and
1364600	1373560	the people that contributed novel insights to many fields that specialists in those fields
1373560	1378360	appreciated and hadn't done, that we are seeing less of that recently than we have in a long time.
1378360	1382760	And this is a whole fascinating debate. I know I'm a bit off topic, but I find this an interesting
1382760	1389000	topic and maybe relevant. Some people think the idea that there is less super genius now is just
1389000	1394520	wrong and some kind of romanticizing the past, but there's pretty meaningful data in here in
1394520	1401240	terms of how quickly do new scientific insights happen or philosophical insights or legal insights
1401240	1405000	happen that are paradigm shifting that would change a Cooney and paradigm or something like that.
1405880	1410200	Some people think it's that there's just so much more fucking knowledge now than there was that you
1410200	1413720	just can't be a polymath that you could have been a polymath before and all the stuff and
1413720	1418920	nobody can now that it takes all of your life to be a specialist in a tiny discipline and that the
1418920	1423320	only thing that can make breakthroughs now is huge teams of specialist scientists with big data
1423320	1431480	processing AIs. There's a lot of different ideas about it. Feynman famously said that he thought
1431480	1435400	he would be in the last generation of great physicists for some time based on what he saw
1435400	1442440	happening in the direction of physics and the direction of education and there have certainly
1442440	1446840	been some developments in physics since but maybe not of the type from modern physics to him.
1449160	1454520	I think there is some truth in this that has that we are actually developing people of that type
1454520	1459240	less globally independent of the increasing complexity of the world as also a factor.
1460200	1466920	I think there's a few reasons for it but one of them that seems to be pretty compelling and so this
1469080	1473880	this article about where the super genius has gone puts forth that there is a lot of data
1473880	1479640	that points to the idea that most of the great polymaths the super geniuses if you want to call
1479640	1484920	it were have one thing really clearly in common obviously not a hundred percent correlation but
1484920	1490280	a higher correlation than anything else which was that they were the result of aristocratic tutoring
1490280	1498040	high quality aristocratic tutoring and that post the kind of modernity and democratic
1498040	1504600	reformation of the world there was no aristocratic tutoring of the same kind and that it really makes
1504600	1511960	a difference so if you think about it this little boy in Tibet identifies certain bulls
1511960	1516200	in pain so we say he's the Dalai Lama from a reincarnation perspective but then how does he
1516200	1524520	get educated right yeah right the top llamas in Tibet who are the top meditators and oracles and
1524520	1528920	philosophers and historians and scholars and mathematicians are all privately training this
1528920	1534760	boy with the investment of their entire culture is the Dalai Lama the result of an educational
1534760	1538840	paradigm that doesn't really scale because how could you have the best teachers of a whole
1538920	1545080	peoples you know for everybody and is the Dalai Lama's type of consciousness and capacity
1545080	1549000	actually something that could be trained if people had access to that it's a fair question
1550600	1557720	when you read meditations by Marcus Aurelius which is also a great philosophic text the first
1557720	1563240	chapter he dedicates just to his tutors right the intact like he writes the book of stoic philosophy
1563240	1567160	as the emperor of Rome and the first chapter is just a dedication to his tutors because when
1567160	1572280	you're being raised to be the emperor of Rome during Rome's high period the best mathematician
1572280	1577880	in all of Rome is your math teacher and the best historian and there was another study I had seen
1577880	1583560	I find this theory of education stuff so deeply fascinating there's a study I'd seen that was
1583560	1590760	looking at world class or what were considered first rate mathematicians and they had some way
1590760	1595160	of defining what a first rate mathematician was and it wasn't just a field's medal it was something
1595960	1600920	some set of things but the highest statistical correlator they could find across everyone who
1600920	1605560	became a first rate mathematician to see like is there some trait that where we can predict this
1605560	1609400	is that when they were young they started to study with a first rate mathematician
1610920	1615160	and of course someone could do a correlation causation question and say was it only because
1615160	1620600	they had such exceptional ability that a first rate mathematician paid attention to them when
1620600	1624760	they were young but it does not appear that that is the direction of causation that they
1624760	1629560	got exposed to a first rate mathematician was teaching at their particular school for a while
1629560	1633320	at the time whatever because there are certain classes where a whole bunch of them came out of
1633320	1638920	that class where that teacher was and it makes sense because your average first grade or 12th
1638920	1644920	grade math teacher at a high school is not a first rate mathematician they're not even a second or
1644920	1649800	third rate mathematician the the brilliance of mathematical thinking the love of it the insight
1649800	1654040	the passion they don't have it they have something else right they study to be an educator they study
1654040	1657240	in a country that couldn't pay you all that much to be an educator so they aren't even a first
1657240	1663640	rate educator so can you learn how to think like a first rate mathematician from a normal math teacher
1663640	1669400	who is themselves someone who has never even had thought like that probably not and the same would
1669400	1675400	be true for spiritual insight or for anything else and so when you look at Marcus Aurelius you're
1675400	1679960	like it was who he was actually just the result of a good educational model and
1680440	1688520	when the modern democracies were forming the idea of feudalism was so disgusting and
1688520	1692440	were pregnant for many reasons and had to be shed away that anything that was a remnant of
1692440	1697800	feudalism had to be put away but in democratizing education to raise higher education for so many
1697800	1703880	people you also lowered the highest version of education to where the wealthy people whose
1703880	1708600	kids are getting tutoring today is to keep up with the normal scholastics of a curriculum based thing
1708680	1717560	it's not a personalized tutoring system for the most part and so I do partly why I was bringing
1717560	1723960	this up is that you know I didn't have a whole field of tutors but I had parents that were doing
1723960	1731160	that with me and then because I saw how valuable it was to have invested people be in that level
1731160	1737320	of dialogue I started seeking out tutors before I even knew this and this is like maybe the highest
1737320	1745640	thing I can recommend to young people or for parents what to do with their kids I somehow
1745640	1750120	knew because I also had stuff like think and grow rich and the kind of like tenacity of a
1750120	1754440	Carnegie to be self-directed as part of the thing but hopefully along a different set of goals than
1754440	1759480	just monetary accumulation but if you have the tenacity of a Carnegie associated with other
1759480	1765480	developmental goals which would be a really good thing whenever I found a teacher that seemed like
1765480	1769960	they knew something I really wanted to learn I figured out what I could possibly do to be useful
1769960	1776440	to them and that looked like cleaning their house and changing babies diapers and learning skills I
1776440	1780120	didn't have they needed electrical done I would learn electrical to those like whatever the fuck
1780120	1783560	it is this is where I want to study from so I'm going to figure out how to be around them and be useful
1783560	1791480	to them and so much of my learning was not what I studied in university that was cool or even just
1791480	1797080	in books on my own it was people who were really really fucking brilliant spending time with me
1797080	1801400	directly because I figured out how to partly I was a gift and partly I figured out how to make that
1801400	1808200	happen and Daniel is part of what you're saying as far as the tutor also a mentor relationship
1808200	1814200	having older people that can not only just download information but somehow impact your soul and your
1814200	1821240	being and you know it's all together see in a mentoring relationship they're not just topical
1821240	1826840	artists right they're who have because they're teaching to a whole class have to teach a curriculum
1827960	1832120	you're the kid is asking them questions that they're interested in the range beyond their
1832120	1838680	subject matter and the and the teacher in that relationship actually cares about them and loves
1838680	1842280	them and gets invested in their education so they ended up getting the benefit of something like good
1842280	1846360	parenting but multiplied by a lot more people a lot more capacities that error correct each other
1847160	1852600	and so the cognitive education shouldn't be limited to one domain separate from others it
1852600	1856520	should go across the domains but it shouldn't be limited to just cognitive education it should be
1856520	1863880	that the you know and so first the various domains of ontology need to integrate it you need to be
1863880	1869960	able to think about biology and chemistry and physics and etc together next is you have to
1869960	1873880	integrate a cross ontology and epistemology whenever the kid is learning something it's not
1873880	1878200	just here is how it works it's why does it work that way how is that discovered that this is one
1878200	1887160	of the next key insights is I never wanted to know a formula in math I wanted to know how long
1887160	1891320	people knew that that problem was interesting and didn't have the formula who discovered at first
1891320	1895640	what novel thing about their life gave them that insight what other new things they discovered
1895640	1902600	afterwards because of that you know like I wanted to know the epistemology and I find that when you
1902600	1908920	get that and you start to get what is the generator function of novel insight what is across all the
1908920	1913000	domains the the people who discovered the most important thing what was happening in them that
1913000	1917080	made them discover the most important thing you can start to develop that in yourself rather than
1917080	1923000	just a huge knowledge set in which case we're just shitty computers and so you want to integrate
1923000	1927080	all the ontologies you want to integrate ontology and epistemology and then all of that in the
1927080	1932440	cognitive domain you want to integrate to why do you care at all why do you care to want to learn so
1932440	1937960	the ethics the aesthetics the pragmatics also come in and the identity of the person in relationship
1937960	1945480	to it comes in and and and is there a developmental sense of responsibility that's transmitted it's
1945480	1950440	like I don't want to let my dad down my mom down these people that taught me I want to live up to
1951400	1955240	the the quality of the love and the gifts and the knowledge that they're imparting to me
1959080	1959480	you know
1968120	1970680	people being motivated to care about
1973560	1977480	people and animals and life forms that they will never meet and will never give them credit
1978360	1982120	like it takes some work it takes some developmental work to get there enough that
1982120	1988680	you'll make real sacrifices to care where you don't get any obvious credit for that it takes
1988680	1995640	having some sense of your identity expanded beyond your own individual self where you're
1995640	1999800	looking through their eyes right and you're and you get that they actually matter to you
1999880	2011000	reality but at first if somebody believes in a sky god that is all knowing all seeing and
2011000	2015480	internal punishment if you fuck up and they know your thoughts so you can't just virtue signal
2015480	2021000	because you can't virtue signal the god that knows it and eternal reward if you get it right so
2021000	2025000	even if you're really just a shithead who just doesn't want to get punished and wants to get a
2025000	2029320	reward you still have to be good all the way down to the level of your thoughts that's kind of awesome
2029800	2033240	right like from the point of view of just how do you get a lot of people who might still be
2033240	2038120	narcissists in a low degree of truly ethical development to do the right thing that kind of
2038120	2045240	like sky god judicial system is kind of awesome and another now it's also terrible because then
2045240	2048760	of course everybody's terrified of burning in hell forever and has to think that someone else
2048760	2053560	who's not getting it right is and they have to terrify their kids of burning in hell but
2053800	2061240	but in the same way the idea that many many traditions had that when I die I'm going to be
2061240	2069960	with the ancestors and I'm going to like and there's some glory of my of the great teachers
2069960	2076120	and will and they're still watching me right and and when I go to be with my forefathers
2076120	2082440	with the teachers in eternity and afterlife do I actually deserve to be with them
2083400	2087160	there's something in noble that can do right there's something powerfully ennobling that
2087160	2092040	old tradition can do of course we also find out that our great teachers are people that have their
2092040	2095880	failings and weaknesses and we have to wrestle with that and we're going to have our own failings
2095880	2099000	and weaknesses and we might get intellectually congruent enough to have some doubts on the
2099000	2106600	metaphysics of that thing but there is there is definitely something even if you don't go to
2106600	2113800	the metaphysics the afterlife version there is something about feeling that you received
2114440	2118280	something that you don't get to take credit for that you're fortunate that someone else was born
2118280	2123320	into a situation that if you were born into you'd be doing less well and that you were fortunate to
2123320	2129800	get to have these experiences and that you owe something to them and to the future world because
2129800	2138520	of that fortune I think that's really important anyway I've got to bring this up preparing for
2138520	2143720	this I went to your websites and I came across a blog article you've written things that I learned
2143720	2153240	from my dad I was deeply moved by this I halfway through when we got to the part how to treat women
2153240	2161320	I think I started weeping and immediately I like your father but I like you because this is what
2161320	2169880	you remembered from your father and it was so incredibly powerful and basic and I see such a
2169880	2179400	need for young men to be initiated into some sort of positive manhood and what your father laid out
2179400	2183080	I got a lot from my father but obviously he was not as articulate as your dad
2183080	2187960	that he lived a lot of these principles that you were talking about and can I read one of them
2191480	2200680	I love this the highest value for men is serving women nature and children future generations
2200680	2202360	the highest value for men
2202360	2208920	you should shout it from the rooftops that's incredibly profound
2212040	2216520	yeah my dad would say things all the time like you're either serving your family or the family
2216520	2221080	of mankind or your off-path those are the only two things that you can be doing that are not off-path
2222440	2229960	and the family of mankind was the term used but inclusive of life not just human life
2233320	2241240	yeah I mean I wrote that because my dad's health was very delicate at the time and it wasn't clear
2241240	2248440	if he was going to be around much longer or not and so often people write a eulogy of all the things
2248440	2252360	that they appreciated from their parent after they're dead and they don't get to experience it
2252360	2259880	directly and I thought that that would be a loss and so I wanted to write it for that reason
2260680	2265400	but I also wanted to write it that particular one is definitely not a full expression
2266120	2271400	of what I learned from my dad it was called things I learned about being a man from my dad
2273080	2277640	and so it was it was definitely oriented to the
2279480	2283720	principles that have to do with transfer of masculinity as opposed to just would be equally
2283720	2289080	true for all people some of them are of course that and part of the reason that I wrote it at
2289160	2297240	that time was I think I had had in conversations a rise in the week or two before of
2299080	2309400	men young men so boy into man phase who had just clearly never been fathered in important ways
2309400	2315000	and were causing pain to women they were in relationships with to people around them were
2315000	2325400	being or leaders and it was just I was like there are so many people that didn't have so many men
2325400	2329960	that are in their masculine role not having the fortune of having had a good role model of
2329960	2337080	teaching in that way and I wonder if some tiny little bit of vicarious element of it can come
2337080	2343080	through by writing about it so that's why I wrote that one in that way I think it came through for
2343080	2349800	me brother thank you for that and one of the things he said is like on your time off what you
2349800	2354200	do is you get in your pickup truck this was before cell phones and all and you drive around and find
2354200	2359080	people are having trouble with their cars getting them started you you fix their cars and send them
2359080	2363320	on their way and he said that's a good time that's the way to spend your day off and it's all
2363320	2371320	his orientation noble disinterested service and it's just anyway but it was so funny because
2371320	2377240	yeah this was before cell phones and so when someone broke down on the side of the road
2377240	2383560	pulling over to pick them up was an important thing and you know my I think part of teaching
2383560	2391240	someone about how the world works in general and also part of the ideas and I understand this is
2391400	2399880	normative like by gender normative thinking on the thing that is how it was given to me
2401800	2409800	was that for a boy growing into a man knowing how to solve problems and fix things
2409800	2416360	was a particularly important thing so anytime there was construction to do he always involved
2416360	2420680	me and it even were involving me and it took a lot more time than doing it without me because
2421240	2426680	he was not just trying to fix the thing he was also trying to raise a child who would someday
2427320	2431000	not just be an adult but would themselves be a parent and a teacher and how to
2431000	2434760	do that thing properly and whenever there was something to fix on the car it took
2434760	2443160	10 times longer to show me how to do it and you know then then not and so but then it was also
2443160	2448040	while we're fixing the car there were so many things like if a job is worth doing it's worth
2448040	2453080	doing well and well begun is half done and see the job do the job stay out of the misery these
2453080	2459320	kind of idioms and the if the job is worth doing it's worth doing well meant just no half-assing
2459320	2464920	the thing like we and so like I'll give you an example that was so beautiful I remember the
2464920	2472520	first time we're building a building from the ground up we laid the studs and then we drilled
2472600	2480360	to the studs to run the wire for the outlets and it was very important to my dad that the way the
2480360	2488280	wiring was in the wall before the drywall went on was beautiful that the holes were at the same
2488280	2494200	height that the Romex was not twisted and that it was beautiful and no one would ever fucking see it
2494200	2501480	we're about to cover it in drywall and you're like why and he's like you know you know you know
2501560	2507640	it's an incredible teaching that's and there's something where it's like the if you can do it
2507640	2512760	any of the ways do it the way that is the most integrous the most awful the most beautiful
2513400	2517640	and you will feel better about it and you'll feel better about who you are and then your
2517640	2520920	unconscious default in the moments where it matters and other things will be to do the
2520920	2524760	thing in the highest way you possibly can as opposed to asking the corner cutting questions and
2525560	2531480	um so the if it's worth doing it's worth doing well see the job do the job stay out of the misery
2531480	2538600	meant uh don't even ask if it's possible and definitely don't bitch about it just if it needs
2538600	2544520	done figure out how to do it and do it with the best attitude because you have choice over your
2544520	2551000	attitude and why would you do it any other way um and well begun is half done meant have you
2551000	2554760	cleaned the space first have you set out the tools do you know what the workflow is going to be
2554760	2558360	because the problems that are going to come up when you've opened everything up it's up on the
2558360	2561720	jacks and you realize you're missing something and you have to go to the store like that's where
2561720	2564840	the danger happened that's where someone gets hurt that's where the inefficiency happens that's
2565720	2573400	so think through the process pretty well first um and anticipate where the mistakes and the
2573400	2576200	problems and the challenges are going to happen there's so much of my work in the
2576200	2580680	metacrisis that is anticipate where the unanticipated externalities going to happen
2582200	2588280	and then internalize those future externalities into the choice making process better and uh yeah
2589000	2598360	yeah like I can see now how you are basically uh self-taught and coached and mentored into
2599240	2606680	uh into the ideals which would lead you into a life of service into a way of thinking
2606680	2616680	which would bring you into a big picture approach and into a planning mode that would allow you to
2616680	2626200	anticipate second third order complications and to think through those to uh you were honed for
2626200	2631720	the work you're doing now wait there's something that I was starting to say it's important please
2631720	2634760	remember your thought because I don't want you to forget it but I don't want to forget this
2635560	2641080	but you were you had um mentioned John the um that a fun time was to load up the tools
2641720	2644520	and go looking for people who are broken down and fix up their car because
2644520	2647560	AAA wouldn't necessarily come all the time especially if it was snowing outside they
2647560	2656760	could actually be in danger um so obviously that meant you know there I had to know some
2656760	2663880	how to fix a car type skills so I was mentioning that my dad would take a lot more time to do the
2663880	2667800	thing than pay someone else to do it and to do it with me than do it on his own because he was
2667800	2675080	wanting me to learn learning these other deeper psychological spiritual integrity lessons along
2675080	2680760	with it like well begun is half done and if a job's worth doing this worth doing well but then
2680760	2687960	also um learning the mechanical engineering of why was the screw threaded this way rather than the
2687960	2693160	other way and why was the sting built this way and then the history of internal combustion engines
2693160	2699640	and when the transmission came out and the um you know like and and then the physics of how
2700280	2704040	the explosion happens inside of the piston and so there's a very integrated set
2704760	2710840	of knowledge that was happening and that takes just a lot of investment right takes a lot of
2710840	2718360	care and a lot of investment and but then when we would do that it was like sunday father son
2718360	2726120	let's have fun um he wasn't into sports so we didn't throw a ball uh that's my my
2726120	2730760	anti-coordination at the level of ball throwing didn't develop all that much but we would uh
2732520	2736760	load the load the truck up with tools and go look for people who are broken down and fix it
2736760	2744280	up and the interesting thing was it didn't feel like some dreadful sacrifice of service that we
2744280	2750040	had to do the way that a lot of people um feel when they're doing some church activity as kids
2750040	2754360	they don't like it felt like the most fun thing we could possibly do like it was just actually
2754360	2758040	really enjoyable because one i'm getting this high quality time with my dad right he's not
2758040	2763640	trying to get me to go do the thing on my own who we're getting to be learning in the process
2763640	2767560	and then helping people where there's this immediate you know expression of these people
2767560	2773000	being delighted and surprised and so there was absolutely it wasn't just like an ethic of service
2773000	2781080	it was like a like a way to condition that as that the what i want for myself personally and
2781080	2788600	who i want to be for the world there wasn't even a distinction yeah beautiful yeah and
2789400	2794280	another thing your dad said and i'll stop parping on your dad i could go on and on this but he said
2794280	2802120	and this is so simple but so profound he said forgive just as a given you've got to forgive
2802120	2808920	and the second part is help them do better so you just don't forgive okay i'm okay i'm clear
2808920	2813720	you know i didn't bother anymore because i forgive him but the other part is help them
2813720	2819720	do better i just think that's one of my and i was a kid and there's a period where my
2820920	2826520	parents were in the tm community and built this beautiful community called lake view
2826520	2832280	estates out in fairfield and we're working on on the kind of enlightened theme park and
2832280	2839480	and a development business and there was someone that was an extremely close friend of the family
2839480	2851960	and um kind of employee and partner who had for whatever reasons um decided that he was going to
2852920	2858760	come into our house and steal a bunch of the artwork and uh because he you know had the
2858760	2867080	key to the house and all like that and uh you know but the trail like that oftentimes very easy to be
2867080	2874200	like want to be vindictive or at least totally cut ties i remember my dad intercepting him
2874200	2878200	not letting him do that and then taking him out and having this conversation like dude what the
2878200	2883800	fuck like what happened inside your head is this who you want to be and and there was still to like
2883800	2893800	help them do better um and one of the ones that really stood out to me and you know i there's
2893800	2899320	something where i feel torn about this first just as a caveat i must say the reason i didn't
2899320	2904520	write one about my mom at the time was because i don't think there is as gruesome a deficit of
2904520	2910120	mothering in the world as there is fathering currently and so i didn't have as many women
2911080	2916840	in sharing with me just like kind of abject failures of fundamental things as i had guys so
2916840	2922440	i was a little bit more motivated for that reason also her health is better but my mother is also
2922440	2928440	everybody's important in in my life and childhood and who i became and uh was the one that got me
2928440	2933240	into activism and had me going door to door with and had all the protests with pita and greenpeace
2933240	2938920	and all those things as a kid and got me studying art and introduced me to dolly and picasso and
2939000	2944200	jebron and blake and you know brought me to all the world religions churches and
2946520	2954840	but going back to my dad here my dad had a strong patriarchal line that taught him some
2954840	2959560	of these things his dad was first generation green beret and so that you know taught that way
2960120	2963960	but he also had a really fucked up childhood with a humongous amount of trauma
2964760	2970200	his dad commits suicide his sister commits suicide is many of his family members were in
2970200	2978440	and out of incarceration in mental institutions and and the violence of the childhood he was in
2978440	2985720	he's covered in physical scars from weapons you know like he had a rough go of it and so
2985720	2992760	some of what he got he got directly but a lot of it was his way to not kill himself was to say
2992760	2997080	maybe he's not crazy the entire world is crazy because the whole world he was exposed to seem
2997080	3004600	completely crazy to him and he'd rethink everything from scratch and so when you do that you come up
3004600	3008520	with a lot of good and interesting things and also are going to make a lot of mistakes and
3008520	3014040	their painful parts in the process and I didn't emphasize those in that letter because it wasn't
3014840	3023240	the purpose of the letter the article but you know my path benefited from all the extreme
3023240	3030360	gifts and it had some like quite interesting hardships as a result of the complexity of
3030360	3036520	who he was from transcending his life all those other things is what got me into therapy young
3036520	3041080	and which I'm also very grateful for because then I ended up getting a huge amount of
3041720	3046040	you know basically parenting from the therapeutic traditions
3048680	3054600	the reason I say that is so that people don't think oh well I can't do well because I had trauma
3054600	3058920	because I didn't have some of these gifts I everybody's life has some gifts and has some
3058920	3062840	fucked up stuff and the difficult stuff the healing of it is what catalyzes their gifts
3063640	3068920	and I just want to say that and some of the gifts that he had were really
3070120	3075640	fairly rare and unusual I'm very grateful for that some of the issues he had were somewhat
3076440	3084360	unusual but when it comes to one of the things on the forgive he definitely had the gift of being
3084360	3090040	physically heroic and there are military men who are trained in that a lot of people are not
3090680	3093880	in this age physically heroic in previous ages that was much more common
3094920	3100040	and there was a time here in Encinitas when I was like 20
3102040	3105640	where which is usually not a violent area my dad was in the
3107960	3113640	parking lot on thoroughfare here El Camino Real gunshots rang out handful of gunshots
3114200	3123480	from a blind store and everybody who was in the parking lot ran the other way or dropped my dad
3123480	3129720	ran straight at the blind store he figured the shooter was still alive and in there turned out
3129720	3134840	the shooter after killing the other person killed himself so by the time my dad got in there the
3134840	3142040	shooter was dead it was a husband who was going in there to suicide homicide his wife
3143000	3152200	and the but he shot himself he stabbed her and when he thought he had finished killing her
3152200	3160280	then he shot himself when my dad got there she was bleeding out but not dead and so he started
3160280	3165000	to put compression and turn the kits and whatever on you know all the areas where the ambulance
3165000	3170440	and police came but then he went to the hospital to be with her and then followed up with her
3170520	3178680	afterwards and in addition to like she would have bled out if he was not there saving her life
3178680	3185720	was him wanting to make sure that she could forgive her husband for that because of knowing how
3185720	3190920	fucked up he was and that he's no longer you know in pain himself or a risk to anybody else
3190920	3197160	but that was like it was his default mode and I mean almost too fast that it can be a bypass
3197240	3203080	but in that moment it was both and you know just a very interesting thing about him is like
3204040	3209160	thinking the shooter was still alive he thought I can keep my body moving long enough if I take
3209160	3214840	shots that I can take him out and more civilians won't get killed which means he was willing to
3214840	3219160	risk his life for people he had never met didn't even couldn't even see to know what color they were
3219160	3225240	a race or whatever this is very noble very beautiful and then the moment the harm of the
3225880	3229880	dying was out of the way the harm of her holding on to that grudging sentiment was the next one he
3229880	3242760	was focused on. What a gift to be exposed to and live with someone like that and not only an education
3242760	3253320	but a transmission of normal values and priorities and to take up a theme a question I began with a
3253320	3260280	little while ago as you've described this it's getting more and more clear how your life has been
3261560	3270840	self-developed and honed and gifted by multiple people to bring you to your life's work which has
3270840	3280040	been the metacrisis and how we as a species and a civilization can continue because clearly we're
3280040	3286040	in danger right now and presumably will be forever after because the technology is probably only
3286040	3295560	going to get more developed and greater capacities etc so you've been you've been you've had these
3295560	3304360	ideals of service transmitted to you've had attitudes of handling them schoolfully looking
3304360	3313240	for complications thinking ahead etc you've also had the multidisciplinary education so how does the
3314920	3323400	how does the to these depths the spiritual depths that and self-inquiry you've gone through not
3323400	3329800	only in spirituality but in psychotherapy and philosophic inquiry how do these how do these
3329880	3337800	depths inform you about our contemporary crises and what do you see lacking that these
3338520	3353800	these steps when these depths aren't appreciated what do we miss
3354760	3369880	I was speaking with a friend recently who does conservation work and she's a brilliant conservationist
3369880	3379720	who has kept huge important areas of high biodiversity intact and has done so at a
3379720	3384200	significant devotion including expense of her own personal life and in other areas
3385880	3395160	we're talking and she had just been in conversation with some of the world's wealthiest people
3396200	3405160	and she asked me when someone asks why should we protect nature how to answer it
3405880	3415400	because that was obviously their question and I said well there's a lot of answers that we can give
3416520	3423400	that from a you from the utility perspective of helping them get why they should care we
3423400	3427400	we look at what they currently care about and we show a rationalized argument between why
3428920	3432680	the harm that would come to nature would harm something they would care about right we draw
3432680	3439960	those connections but before getting there the fact that someone has to ask that question in
3439960	3447320	earnest speaks to something broken in them at minimum something pathologically underdeveloped
3448840	3457320	and if they had had a life where they grew up in any real contact with their own embodiment
3457320	3462280	their own kind of biology and experience of being in a body being and in any real contact with
3462920	3468520	nature and other sentient beings that question just wouldn't even arise
3470840	3474920	it would be prima facie right it would be it would be obvious and the question would simply be
3474920	3486920	how do we do a better job with it and I saw one of the in the brief look one of the questions
3487000	3493720	that you sometimes explore with guests of like what are the questions that orient their relationship
3493720	3502680	to the sacred and I think at the at the heart of it it's not even a question right it's a
3503800	3512840	something more like a perception I think if someone is perceiving somewhat clearly
3513240	3523240	then the sacredness of life is prima facie just is and I don't remember the exact quote but it was a
3526200	3529240	Joseph Campbell quote that was something to the effect of
3530440	3536520	that we think what we want is to know what the meaning of life is when what we're
3536520	3541480	actually seeking is the experience of being fully alive and I don't think that is the whole
3541480	3545240	because someone can experience being fully alive in fairly self-centered ways just doing
3546440	3553400	you know extreme sports and whatever but it is also true that in the moments where someone is
3553400	3557960	experiencing feeling fully alive they're not an existential angst about what is the meaning of life
3558920	3565800	and I think that oftentimes the actual intrinsic sacredness and meaningful of
3565800	3572200	meaningfulness of life that happens through a deep enough bandwidth of connection and sensing
3575480	3582680	the longing for that it's filtered through the mind as a desire to understand what is the purpose
3582680	3586920	of all of this what is the meaning with a whole bunch of bad assumptions about like what thing is
3586920	3594040	it building to that seems like a terminal value that then I can't then that will be a satisfying
3594040	3597560	answer where if we say well the purpose is love then I say well what is the purpose of that or
3597560	3606120	the purpose is learning well what is the purpose of it it's so we can the first the concept of
3606120	3611960	purpose and the concept of meaningfulness are not identical but the reality of them and the
3611960	3626520	concept of them are not the same either and so how to develop a deeper connection to the
3627800	3635960	a deeper connection to life and deeper ability to perceive the innate uniqueness of everything
3635960	3639800	and the interconnectedness of everything at the same time right the interconnectedness of it all
3639800	3646360	but not it's not it's not a homogenous oneness where because if it's a homogenous oneness
3646360	3649960	it doesn't matter how many of these ones die it doesn't matter if the species goes the oneness
3649960	3655480	is still oneness if it is just uniqueness but not interconnectedness well then in the service
3655480	3660600	of this one I can damage these ones it's every part unique and every part radically interconnected
3661480	3666680	in which case it is all an expression of the whole so I whatever I care about I also have
3666680	3671080	to care about all of it because it's connected and also each part is irreplaceable and those
3671080	3676440	totally precious right and it's not that is the thought it's that is the perception
3678280	3685720	from there from that base state of perception I think the right other questions and analytics
3686280	3695480	more naturally arise yes so the to the extent we can open ourselves to
3697080	3706280	the totality of experience to to life the world and to ourselves to that extent in some ways
3706840	3711720	and so in one sense one could say the questions fall away because the questions are conceptual
3711800	3716920	and we're you're now speaking to an experiential openness and directness
3718280	3726840	that give birth to understandings or intuitions which can flower into concepts
3728520	3733240	obviously I'm obviously into concepts right I'm obviously into work
3733480	3740440	you're a good company um I wrote a blog piece a while ago called the dance of the
3740440	3746120	Tao and the 10 000 things and maybe that one can be linked I'm specifically talking about that because
3747160	3754760	you know there's this concept in Taoism that every day in the practice of knowledge something is
3754760	3762040	added every day in the practice of the Tao something is dropped and but I think they are
3762040	3770040	both meaningful and I think that not only there's a way in which learning more about the 10 000
3770040	3776440	things the field of conceptuality and interfere with one's connection to the Tao there's a way
3776440	3781480	that it can also enhance it yes you don't know how they can dance together if you don't know how it
3781480	3789880	can enhance it then you have to just avoid intellect mind past future mostly the things
3789880	3794440	that are uniquely sapient uniquely adult sapient and say look at the lilies of the field look at
3794440	3797960	the little children you're like yes the things that don't have the prefrontal cortex yes the
3797960	3803240	prefrontal adult brain can cause problems but it also has unique evolutionary purposes we just
3803240	3810520	have to use it right um and two things there Daniel one one is the intention what's the intention
3810520	3815800	of using the intellect is it to get lost in the abstractions or is it in the service of the solution
3815800	3823400	and the other is the skill and capacity to integrate into a kind of vision logic say
3824200	3829560	I think those are both part of it I had a friend that I think you know Samantha Sweetwater
3830680	3835080	she hasn't been on this podcast she'd be great to be on she just left me a message this morning with
3836280	3842360	a thought she was saying the way she phrased it was that sapience is in service of sentience
3842440	3849000	if it is to be rightly guided oh I thought that was a nice way of phrasing it I um
3850280	3855240	in terms of the Greek the true the good and the beautiful triad I remember writing to an
3855240	3861480	artist friend of mine on her birthday once uh that the true and the good only matter because
3861480	3867800	the beautiful is um or no I think I said truth and goodness only matter because beauty is that
3867800	3872760	the beauty was actually the fundamental thing if reality did not have intrinsic beauty I wouldn't
3872760	3877640	actually care to be good to it or to know it or to whatever there's something that is intrinsic
3877640	3884360	that is deeper than the why Daniel I plenty yeah I have a follow-up question to all this
3884920	3892040	and I know they they threw it at Carl Young so uh I'm gonna throw it at you do you believe in God
3898760	3902200	I remember many many years ago and I wouldn't phrase it this way
3902760	3909400	any what more and there's maybe 15 years ago I wrote a poem called uh the atheist who writes love
3909400	3921560	poems to God and um it was saying do I believe in God not in any God that is believable meaning
3922200	3928680	that I don't remember where it went but the idea that what the word belief means is
3930120	3941000	the idea that a proposition about reality actually maps to reality and so belief is a
3941560	3947880	thing that can happen inside of propositional logic and propositions have to be formed in
3947880	3958440	semiotics right in in semantics and syntax do I believe that there is some sentences that I can
3958440	3967960	say that define what God is uh where I would say yes that is a description that I think is both
3967960	3973160	true and comprehensive and you know adequate and no I don't I think that's why the first verse of
3973160	3976760	the Tao Te Ching is the Tao that is speakable it's not the eternal Tao so if you believe in the Tao
3976760	3986440	you missed the whole fucking thing um if you you can have a outside of semiotics outside of
3986440	3993080	propositional experience outside of propositional knowledge experience of a kind of wordless knowing
3993080	3999480	in a connection to wholeness but you don't then try to reduce that to propositions about the world
3999800	4002680	so I think there's a lot of people that will have
4005800	4011320	real experiences that are numinous and transcendent and then try to make a belief based on that
4011880	4019800	and I think that's usually misguided so uh if I wanted to speak to beliefs do I think
4019800	4028840	that consciousness is an emergent property of brains probably not do I think that there
4028840	4035240	are things that don't have brains including other types of biology and whatever that might
4035240	4041240	have some quality or there is something that is like to be them probably yes but I'm holding all
4041240	4049400	this I say probably even though I think there's some pretty strong arguments uh because I I think
4050200	4056680	too much certainty about any of these things is really problematic um do I think that
4056680	4065080	it might not just be biology but that anything that self-organizes has some type of interiority
4065080	4075080	or self-ness in some kind of panpsychic type way yeah sure I do do I think that um
4076920	4081320	even though each cell in our brain or body is its own self-organizing thing they come together to
4081320	4085880	make something that is synergistically more than the sum of them taken separately yes do I think
4085880	4093160	that might be true for say universe as a whole or very large things within universe like galaxies
4093160	4102520	or whatever yeah I think that's interesting so do I think that um there are types of sentience
4102520	4112040	and types of intelligence that are more deep and vast by far than our imagination can think about
4112840	4119960	totally do I think that there is the possibility to in some meaningful ways
4119960	4128520	connect there and have results come from that connection yes do I think that there is an inherent
4128520	4136440	sacredness in all that is physically and metaphysically yes I wouldn't reduce all that to saying I
4136440	4149560	believe in God I rather think of it as something more respectful than the reduction to a proposition
4150040	4157320	I get that yeah um but but I was actually just talking with um a very close friend the other day
4158200	4164760	about an aspect of learning theory there are certain things
4166520	4179320	that when I learn them I have to work to implement them as effectively as I can because
4179880	4193080	I can't not I just I can't not and uh and there are many people who don't have that they um they
4193080	4197400	forget like they learn the thing and they forget and they're like oh yeah that was about I forgot
4197400	4201320	let me get back on path are they there's some different depth of the care about the thing
4201320	4205960	that is of course the result of all the exposure and whatever and I'm like yeah there is something
4205960	4211880	where it is like actually like the difference is actually believing there's a god right meaning
4213320	4219400	but it and that was the term that I used to just kind of make it simple in which if one actually
4220120	4225560	believes there's a god then they can go they can work to perfect themselves go to happily
4225560	4230120	die in a holy war whatever it is because there is some superordinate thing that is so fucking
4230120	4234920	important that everything else falls in line to that so there there is something for me and
4234920	4238440	belief in karma can do that right there is something that is like believing in a god
4239640	4245640	that is the coordinating basis of everything for me but it isn't believing in a god
4246280	4253000	and I can't do better with words no that yes I think that's a very sacred holy answer I think
4253000	4260120	you handled it really well and thank you for even even doing that means a lot yeah I'm beautiful that
4261080	4267720	certain that some of the some of the intimations in your response were
4268280	4278120	about to the uh unknowable mystery of reality bottomless fathomless inconceivable and to the
4278120	4287240	transconceptual nature of that mystery and actually of life that that the idea so the
4287240	4294840	doubt that can be named is not the eternal doubt and even more than that we can't any statement we
4294840	4303160	make is you know in fact it can be valuable but it's never fully adequate to the reality of anything
4303960	4311160	and to the extent that you think that you even unconsciously even fuzzily think of it as adequate
4311160	4316680	now it's actually harming you yes because now it deadens your perceptions now it creates
4317880	4323400	less you don't see the reality you see the frame of the reality that you expect to see it in and
4323400	4327640	you stop seeing where that model is inadequate which means you stop learning because you're
4327640	4332520	now filtering reality through that model because it's convenient so in that thing the dance of the
4332520	4340760	doubt and the 10 000 things there's one part where I say do atoms exist I'm like kind of kind of because
4341720	4347560	uh and I'm and I didn't play with it from the point of view of is there physicality at all or
4347560	4353480	is that all just an epiphenomenon of consciousness or is this a simulation I wasn't even playing
4353480	4359400	with it from that direction I was just saying do atoms exist well the periodic table works pretty
4359400	4367880	well we can actually uh do atomic level engineering and chemistry pretty well right this is it's about
4367880	4377000	as good a science as we've got there's a a lot of um good empirical things regarding atoms
4378280	4385720	but when I define an atom the formal definitions will like we can do it in terms of the Schrodinger
4385720	4390680	equation or information theory or particle physics or whatever but we'll say okay you've got nucleons
4390680	4394760	and you have electrons and you have orbitals and whatever um you can just say where in the
4394840	4403960	periodic table row and column it is and it's an ion or but does that atom exist without the strong
4403960	4413480	force does it exist without electromagnetism does it exist without the Higgs field does it exist
4413480	4418200	without the gauge bosons that mediate the connections the gluons and the Higgs boson it
4418200	4422200	doesn't exist without any of those things and yet none of them are included in the definition
4422200	4427640	when we say atom we take them all for granted so if I remove those that are not part of the
4427640	4435800	definition do atoms exist nope so if I want to define an atom adequately that it actually exists
4435800	4445880	can I do that nope and so I have to take for granted a trans finite amount of reality
4446840	4454600	to define this thing in a way that is useful but is it real kind of you've walked your way into
4454600	4462200	the buddhist shunyata and into the why buddhist wayan philosophy of the concealed and the revealed
4462200	4470200	that any perspective unveils or conceals a universe and simultaneously conceals another one
4470680	4477240	this is absolutely fascinating we could go anywhere with this but I want to I want to ask you
4479640	4486200	from this this perspective or these multiple perspectives you're bringing to bear
4486200	4493320	on your own your understanding of of everything what do you see as some of the deeper
4493320	4502360	unrecognized usually unacknowledged causes of the metacrisis and I'll just give a little context
4502360	4508040	and I think one of the beautiful things about the way the way you appreciate the metacons crisis
4508760	4515000	is you're very aware of the traps of reductionism or what I would call the single focus fallacy
4515960	4525240	which there are three a single issue fallacy the we're facing global warming that's it
4525240	4532040	a single cause fallacy it's all due to capitalism and the single solution fallacy so I love the way
4532040	4539240	you're thinking transcends those limitations and and recognize the traps of reductionism so
4539240	4544280	in asking you what you see as some of the deeper causes I certainly acknowledge that you don't
4545240	4551960	these aren't it but they are important elements and they're ones that don't often get don't as often
4551960	4564040	get spoken to yeah okay so the question as I understood is are are there
4564120	4572680	drivers or causes of the issues we face in the world and of the thing that
4574680	4579480	I sometimes call the metacrisis that we haven't defined here but I'm defining enough other places
4579480	4585640	of someone who is not already familiar they can check it out that are not the ones that we usually
4585640	4592200	talk about that are somehow deeper and I'm going to translate that to are there things in the inner
4592200	4600920	landscape of people's experience and psyche specifically just when we were saying are there
4600920	4607320	spiritual dimensions or interior dimensions the reason I want to make the distinction is because
4607320	4619800	I don't know that the term deeper makes sense just for quick point of reference I would not say
4619800	4625400	that I am a physicalist or an idealist in the classic philosophical sense of
4626040	4632200	physicalist meaning that physics comes first matter and force fields and third person stuff and
4632200	4638280	that consciousness emerges from that somewhere nor am I an idealist and that consciousness comes
4638280	4643160	first and all of the physics is an emergent property of consciousness structures of mind or
4643160	4655320	something I would say that the the subjective stuff and the objective stuff have you want to
4655320	4659400	think of that all the words have problems we can talk about first person third person we can talk
4659400	4670280	about the quality and the physics but that they are equally fundamental and co-informing
4670280	4676440	co-arising facets of an integrated reality and the relationship between them is part of that
4676440	4683640	fundamentality so I wouldn't say consciousness is deeper than physics to the nature of reality
4685000	4692360	I think that's a weird kind of dualism still I think information theory affecting physics has
4692360	4698920	already started to get a lot of people at least in this realm because if you say okay well consciousness
4698920	4703240	stuff is deeper than physics stuff and like well what is physics stuff well it's like atoms
4704120	4709720	atoms are subatomic particles and subatomic particles are some weird Heisenbergian Schrodinger
4709720	4717400	thing which seems a lot like some type of pattern of information that doesn't sound like physics
4717400	4724600	anymore right and it doesn't necessarily sound as different it's not like just some dead inert
4724600	4727960	matter it doesn't sound as different from the consciousness stuff especially as you start to
4727960	4731880	do a similar dive on what the consciousness stuff is because you say well is that information
4731880	4737640	processing on some information processing substrate what does that mean so in the same way
4738840	4743800	that I wouldn't say consciousness is deeper than physics or the other way around I wouldn't say that
4743800	4751240	the psychological drivers of the metacrisis are deeper than the technological or the economic ones
4752200	4763160	I would say that they are co-informing co-influencing and that to really address it there are necessary
4763160	4768680	things that have to happen across each of those areas and that sufficiency only happens across all
4768680	4774920	of them and I won't belabor the point because we've written and talked about it we wrote a
4775720	4781080	paper in the conciliance project called why technology is not values neutral
4782280	4791000	and it's worth people looking at and it shows just a brief overview of the work of
4792040	4801080	Marvin Harris and Marshall McLuhan and so many people in theory of technology of how
4801800	4807960	technologies change the nature of mind and psychology individually and collectively the
4807960	4815640	nature of culture in ways that are really subtle and not not obvious so I you know there's always
4815640	4826040	this question of there's the what technologies the world develops and what social systems it
4826040	4831000	develops are those the result of the consciousness and values of the people or the consciousness
4831000	4835000	and the values of the people who are born as babies being conditioned by the world that they're in
4835000	4840040	and the dominant systems and what things happen to be successful and if the worldview and the
4840040	4848120	technology creates don't win a war it just gets wiped out and so I'm framing it this way because
4848120	4853560	I think the deeper thing is actually really problematic it's you mentioned
4854280	4861000	um Roger the reductionism one type of reductionism is to say there's only one thing the other type
4861000	4865160	is say there's a handful of things but my favorite thing is the most important one um
4865960	4873720	and so being able to understand the co-arising and non-reduced process is actually really important
4875720	4882680	um if I can introduce if I can introduce the concept here Daniel I find I have a neologism
4883240	4888680	which is omnideterminism everything determines everything and I think that's what you're speaking
4888680	4899240	to yeah um yeah I might more usually talk about omni influence that everything is influenced
4899240	4905640	everything but not in a way that is absolutely deterministic because um nice refinement thank
4905640	4912200	you there are things that are outside of hard determinism still that influence the net result
4912280	4918440	of what happens also when we say omni we mean in the direction of all inclusive but we can never
4918440	4926840	actually know we're being all inclusive um so in fact we can know for sure that we aren't being
4926840	4932600	that's actually important um I can know for sure that I am not being all inclusive because
4932600	4944120	computationally it would be impossible um so the framing of the metacrisis we often talk about
4946520	4952920	involves like a frame I'll use often is um from Marvin Harris's work but to understand
4952920	4958440	its civilization you can think of it in terms of these three areas its infrastructure its
4958440	4962600	social structures and its superstructure its infrastructures all the technologies the whole
4962600	4969080	tech stack and all the modes of material development and like that the social structures are all the
4969080	4974760	collective agreement fields everything from the system of governance the law the institutions that
4974760	4981400	mediate it and the superstructure is the religion the cultural ideology the values the definition
4981400	4988040	of the good life so the the superstructure is kind of the spirituality psychology
4988040	4993480	interiority of the people at the collective level and so of course we're always talking about that
4993480	4999560	so I think seeing the top level frame of how all those fit together is worthwhile so if people
4999560	5007000	haven't um I'll just reference talked about in a bunch of places a good friend Nate Hagins who's
5007000	5013160	very good thinker on um specifically the relationship between the environment and energy and the
5013160	5019240	financial system he and I just did a five part series on his podcast and then the fourth part
5019240	5024440	we do a kind of an overview of the metacrisis that covers this the third part unintentionally
5025400	5031720	just because it came up we ended up covering how does one like emotionally psychologically and
5031720	5036520	spiritually deal with the reality of the metacrisis given that there's so much to care about beyond
5036520	5040200	what we feel like we have a sense of agency about those are ones that people might find
5040200	5044520	interesting the fifth one we talk about frameworks to think through solutions
5044520	5051400	competently so with all that prefacing I'll say some things here that I think maybe have not said
5051400	5060760	as much other places that are relevant to what in the interiority of human psyches and experiences
5060840	5067480	and cultures uh is a key or our key drivers of the problems of the world
5069800	5075560	I want to mention how many things there are that we probably have no fucking clue about
5076520	5081000	that are really critical just just to give a tiny couple examples
5083560	5087080	we know that there are a lot of species that have gone extinct at somewhere between 100 and
5087080	5091640	a thousand times the background rate of extinction since the industrial revolution as a result of
5091640	5101080	human activity those species are not just in the world externally there is a similar biodiversity
5101080	5109000	loss and species extinction in the microbiome of the human being and the microbiome of the human
5109000	5113640	being produces some of the necessary chemicals for us to work our genome doesn't actually produce
5113640	5118920	all the things some aspects of the macrophage binding protein and various things like that
5118920	5126840	are not adequately coated in the genome without a microbiome and and so extinction of some of
5126840	5132520	those is pretty humongous it's like deleting chunks of our genome right and but if you start
5132520	5137640	having ubiquitous antibiotics and chlorine in the water and pesticide exposure and all those types
5137640	5144280	of things so how much when you realize that somewhere between 50 and 80 percent of the
5144280	5149880	major mono and amine neurotransmitters like dopamine serotonin and gob are produced by the
5149880	5155240	microbiome in the gut and that how you think how you perceive what you believe how happy you are
5155240	5160840	what you your orientation towards violence will large to be or the result of that how much of
5160840	5166840	what seems like a spiritual crisis in the world is the result of the effects of the unintended
5166920	5174360	consequences of our kind of war on bacteria and biology and actually destroying part of the
5176760	5181160	code set that makes us able to be us that's not something that people often would think of when
5181160	5187640	they're thinking of the spiritual drivers of a thing but that is really important and if we
5188680	5194760	you know if we look at the Anthropocene at the human built world there are so many aspects of
5194760	5198680	the human built world that built a world we did not genetically evolve in we're not genetically
5198680	5207000	adapted to that makes us misfit to our own being in important ways um obviously for the
5208200	5213800	200,000 or 300,000 years of homo sapien history and the couple million years of hominin history
5216040	5221720	we always lived in tribes there was no such thing as not living in tribes until extremely
5221720	5226440	recently but we've been this way long enough that it seems like the nuclear family household
5226440	5229720	was the most obvious thing and the only thing that could ever be and we can't really imagine
5229720	5235080	anything else and yet it evolutionarily we evolved to fit in tribes so we so all the
5235080	5242440	shit about attachment theory we we evolved to have attachment to like 150 people like strong
5242440	5250200	attachments and where our life literally depended upon them we couldn't get our the the person who
5250280	5252920	knows medicine it's the only person who knows medicine i'm not going to interact with other
5252920	5256920	people so i can't just have a market opportunity to go to anybody so i actually need people and
5256920	5260840	they need me so i can't be a shithead to them so i and everybody's going to see what everybody
5260840	5265640	does so i can't lie and get away with it so like everything about psychology attachment theory
5267800	5272440	bonding the ideas of codependence and interdependence we're totally different and we evolved in that
5272440	5278280	setting right so then we get birth control and we're like oh sex doesn't have to equal reproduction
5278280	5283080	anymore even though forever sex always equals possibility of reproduction we evolved to have
5283080	5286760	our neural chemistry means sex equals the possibility of reproduction we put in birth
5286760	5291960	control our neural chemistry and our evolutionary value didn't just change overnight but now we're
5291960	5296680	acting in a way where it's like as if it doesn't mean that thing but a huge part of our whole
5296680	5302520	being is responding that way so the reason i bring this up is if we were to try to comprehensively list
5304600	5305640	all of the things
5308360	5311880	that are conditioning our psyches in ways that they did not evolve
5312520	5319560	to process and that are not optimal for us at an individual thriving a community thriving
5319560	5328040	or a global thriving would be this podcast would take days um and so that's a big topic
5328040	5336120	i just want to yes um if and i say that because if i say anything else first i'm
5337080	5343960	concerned that people over norm on that as the thing and then again lose observation to all
5343960	5349800	the things and complexity of all things so if i wanted to speak to something as the thing it would
5349800	5357400	be the nature of mind that makes us lose orientation to the complexity and the interconnectivity of
5357400	5365000	all the things um so if i if i was going to try to say what is the psychological generator function
5365080	5372120	of the metacrisis one i think as good a way of saying it as i could is kind of
5373560	5380920	not exactly the way david bone said it but it's derived from the way i heard him when he said the
5382920	5387480	problems of the world result from a fragmented consciousness that sees the world as a bunch
5387480	5391080	of parts and doesn't see the wholeness of things and he talked about wholeness in the
5391080	5396440	implicate order and can we perceive through that wholeness and obviously we know he was a student
5396440	5400840	of einstein's and einstein said it's an optical delusion of consciousness to believe there are
5400840	5406200	separate things there is one thing that we call universe and that we have to work to develop our
5406200	5416280	perception um so some of the problems in the world happen by be by intentionally advantaging
5416280	5421240	some things at the expense of other things we know it'll cause an expense so we're advantaging
5422680	5429080	our country at the expense of another country in a war which means our people our land our
5429080	5435080	riches or whatever at the expense of that for those people um that obviously means we're able to
5435080	5441080	separate the world enough to be able to think about this trade-off of good for these ones
5442040	5446440	and even though we know it's bad for these ones okay because we separate the interconnectedness
5446440	5452040	of everything and whether it's a country doing that to another country or in a relationship
5452040	5456040	of a person doing that to another person thinking they can possibly win a fight and someone they
5456040	5459480	love actually not get their needs met and that equals a good life for them somehow which is
5459480	5469640	fucking ridiculous idea um uh or at the level of corporations or anything else or humans with
5469720	5473400	regard to the biosphere or other animals we can advantage ourselves at their expense which
5473400	5479560	obviously a factory farm and an uh uh industrial fishing fleet are not good for those animals
5479560	5483480	are not good for the oceans are not good for the people working on them in poor conditions
5485800	5489720	the other problems in the world is where we didn't know that we're causing the harm right so we can
5489720	5494040	either benefit something at the expense of something else knowingly or we can benefit
5494040	5498520	something at the harm of something else not knowing so conflict theory and mistake theory
5499480	5505320	um and the real politic assessment of humans is the problems in the world are because we are
5505320	5511720	dumb and nasty right like roughly if you want to make it very simple dumb is we cause problems
5511720	5516840	that we didn't anticipate and nasty as we cause problems that we knew we're going to happen and
5517480	5522440	so the how do we enlighten humans has to deal with both the dumb and nasty part right if we're
5522440	5527720	talking if we're talking about how do we have the not not just how do you affect human behavior
5527720	5532200	through different rewards and deterrents and social norms and systems of law but through people
5532200	5537640	wanting something different having an internal motivational basis it would be can we expand
5537640	5544920	the circle of care where they care about more that's the even the nasty part and can we expand the
5545480	5549800	complexity of process where they can actually calculate their effects so that they are not
5549800	5555880	unintentionally harming things more that's the deal with the dumb part um but similarly there if I'm
5555960	5557960	thinking about
5561160	5566280	co2 and how critical it is to get it down but I'm not thinking about ocean dead zones
5567640	5573240	from nitrogen effluent using nitrogen fertilizer to grow more crops that will sequester more co2
5574520	5577800	seems like a good idea even though it's going to cause this other externalized issue
5578360	5583560	so again my ability to separate the ocean dead zones and the co2 is what's causing that unintentional
5584120	5589320	right or thinking about that facebook will be some cool system for people being able to tag photos
5589320	5593240	and get to know each other not thinking about what its effect on democracy will be with that particular
5593240	5604840	ad model I would say all the problems look like people all the problems come from harm happening
5604840	5609240	somewhere as a result of human choice but the choice was motivated by someone trying to benefit
5609240	5614680	something so they're all based on tradeoffs so it's either I'm trying to benefit myself now at
5614680	5622600	my own future expense addiction and compulsiveness I am uh so the parts conflict can even be within
5622600	5630360	oneself right um I'm trying to benefit my people my religion my nation my political party whatever
5630360	5634760	at the expense of the other one so great you get your political party elected you polarize the
5634760	5640120	population worse next time they'll swing back harder and you're actually not progressing anything
5640120	5648680	other than increasing polarization um or I am seeking to benefit things and the harm I'm
5648680	5653160	causing elsewhere I just didn't know I didn't know that leachate was going to cause that pollution
5653160	5657960	over there or whatever the other thing is so when bone was talking about the fragmented
5657960	5664680	consciousness it was both at the level of aware of the connectedness and care about the connectedness
5665720	5674360	and so really the key is seeing reality as parts right seeing reality as a bunch of separated parts
5675720	5681080	leads to being able to care about a part and seek to advantage it in a way that causes harm to
5681080	5684920	other things and then cascade effects of other agents doing this similar stuff and so you get
5684920	5690760	cumulative harm effects and you get escalating arms races so not being able to perceive stuff as a
5690760	5695080	bunch of separated parts but perceiving everything in relationship to everything else perceiving
5695080	5698920	everything as a part of an interconnected whole where your ability to benefit that thing had to
5698920	5702760	mean both caring about everything that it's connected to and being able to think through
5702760	5707960	everything that's connected to come up with a strategy that is omnibeneficial or as close to
5707960	5713000	that as possible and that where you made a mistake in it you're also ongoingly aware and working to
5713000	5718760	correct it I would say from the psychological perspective that's probably as deep a thing as
5718840	5725480	we can say and even stuff like but aren't people wouldn't wouldn't we say impulsiveness and selfishness
5725480	5730360	and addiction are even deeper than that because obviously all of the environmental harm is happening
5730360	5735480	because people are buying too much shit to get a keep up with the Joneses or get a hit of something
5735480	5742520	well it's still the same thing right like it's it is still the thing of that their future self is
5742520	5747080	being harmed for their momentary self because their momentary self feels fucked up enough that it
5747080	5754360	thinks that it means to get ahead of it so the parts conflict the the theory of tradeoff starts
5754360	5759480	within the self between the parts of itself the Jungian parts reconciliation then would be the
5759480	5765400	basis for being able to also have a wholeness of self in relationship with the wholeness of world
5765720	5768840	um
5771800	5779160	yeah let me let me um a couple of things uh given that and I've listened to you talk about these
5779160	5787000	issues a lot and sometimes I'm just left with just oh we are so fucked you know but given that
5787960	5799800	the solution of survivability as our current species on this our home seems to be ignorance
5799800	5808200	and just uh being bad actors uh do you feel that enough of us that there's any kind of hope or
5808200	5814760	sense that enough of us can evolve to a level where we can recognize this fractured and recognize
5814760	5821000	what we're doing enough to keep us together as a human family connected to the whole so that we
5821000	5824920	can survive this this choke point in our evolutionary history
5833240	5838680	I don't think there is much of a human family to keep together that is anything other than
5838680	5843560	an abstract idea at this point that some people hold and many people don't even hold
5844440	5851480	that's an ideal I think
5855800	5858440	the question of is it possible
5861080	5870920	to make it through the issues that the world is facing today the whole plurality of issues
5870920	5875480	that are unprecedented historically because we hadn't had centuries of industrial tech bringing
5875480	5881240	us up to planetary boundaries and we hadn't had exponential tech or even small number of actors
5881240	5884600	could fuck everything up so quickly and we didn't have a world that had so much fragility
5886520	5893080	given that we could have massive catastrophic harm from so many different vectors from synthetic
5893080	5899080	bio created pandemics and from AI autonomous drone weapons and from climate change and from
5899800	5905720	chemical planetary boundaries and from scaling war is there to make it through we have to avoid
5905720	5912600	all of those to fail we only have to have any of them happen and our crack record doesn't look good
5912600	5920680	right if you look back at the history of empires at all the history of war and environmental
5920680	5926360	destruction is a pretty big part of that story we don't seem to be really noble stewards of power
5926360	5930120	so as we're getting exponentially more power and we've usually used our power to
5931880	5937160	do power games with each other meaning destroy each other and in ways that harm the environment
5937160	5943080	is there any way that we can steward exponential power in a finite space I would say it takes a
5943080	5952360	step function like it will take something significant that is more than just the continuation of
5952360	5955560	whatever good aspects the enlightenment created or something like that
5959240	5963800	in the huge shift after world war two it was a big shift we made a whole new world system
5964440	5965720	but the answer was still
5968680	5973080	extract more from nature even faster make more money and make more tech like it the
5973080	5979960	Bretton Woods world system was a world system but in more increase for everybody was still a
5979960	5983000	somewhat easier thing to do than when you're hitting planetary boundaries and you have to say
5983000	5986760	no we actually have to reduce consumption across everybody where a lot of people are like no I
5986760	5991640	would rather not reduce my consumption go to war and have less people and I think I can win like
5991640	5997000	this it's hard the situation we're in right now is unprecedented at a global level in such deep ways
5997000	6006200	right so do I think it is possible to make it through I think the question is it possible to
6006280	6011320	make it through without great harm doesn't even make sense because we're in species extinction
6011320	6016520	and war today like great harm is happening today people are being killed in Ukraine people are
6016520	6020840	being killed in Armenia and Azerbaijan people are being killed all over because of these issues
6021880	6030440	and species are going extinct today so we're already in the great harm phase I almost know
6031000	6036520	adolescents don't have body dysmorphia in the Instagram etc world like that's
6037560	6044040	so we're already in that right now do I think we can make it through without catastrophes
6044040	6049880	where hundreds of millions of people die is one question do I think we can make it through where
6049880	6054200	there are any humans left I think we make it through where there are humans and something
6054200	6060920	that isn't just a totally scorched earth these are all different questions the answer
6061960	6068680	can we make it through without the catastrophes intensifying no no no chance so so
6068680	6075800	so given all this the the question comes up how then should we live given the truth of
6077240	6082200	well this next part is critical can we make it through without the catastrophes intensifying
6082200	6087800	no they're going to intensify because no matter what we do today there is no inactable path
6089080	6095320	to preventing the extreme weather events that climate change alone is going to mediate there's
6095320	6100040	a lot of things like that and then the human migration that's going to come from that we can
6100040	6106840	if we do the very best things we can make it less bad but there is also no we there is no we that
6106840	6114200	is a unified acting group right um the what china's interests are and what the us's interests are
6114200	6119320	what the individual with the left and right within the us's interests are what the individual us people
6119320	6125560	versus the elites in it they're not the same and so the whole like one of the biggest mistakes I made
6125560	6132600	growing up was I always thought in this royal we that like humanity thoughtfully was all reading
6132600	6137480	bucky's operating manual for spaceship earth and we're all you know thinking about un charters and
6137480	6141640	looking at the earth and the astronauts perspective and carrying carl sagan's pale blue dot and of
6141640	6149320	course we want to do the right and smart and good thing for everybody uh the thing that some people
6149320	6154920	think is really good the other people think is really horrible and when you realize that
6155880	6163880	the enactment gets really hard right is is the legality of abortion protecting women's freedoms
6163880	6172840	and rights or is it murdering infants um you'll see the most severe uh ideological differences
6172840	6178040	on what is good they create a basis for massive conflict and you see that across so many things
6178760	6187320	right so um that's why I said there isn't a human family to hang together like that's
6187320	6195960	that's an aspirational thing um do I think that if there is already a trajectory of some people who
6195960	6201080	care about not just their own political party or their own nation or their own race or even
6201080	6205560	their own species but care pretty considerably and are working in service of that that there are
6205560	6209960	increasing number of people who have both more care more capacity and more interconnectivity
6210600	6214280	and they cannot then also work with other people who maybe don't care about all of that but in
6214280	6218840	increasingly good coordination for the things they do care about yes that's happening right
6218840	6225960	there's a good thing in emergence that is happening do I think that that could be sufficient
6227000	6234200	to make it through without total extinction or scorched earth yes totally do I think it
6234200	6240120	can make it through without the catastrophes intensifying no they will intensify before even
6240120	6248440	on the best course do I think that it's a given that we make it through no which means we are no
6248440	6254120	matter what in a phase of increasing intensity ahead and with I think both the what it takes to
6254120	6258600	avoid all the catastrophes is deep enough change to the world systems that it's like that Bohmian
6258600	6264120	thing that we are neither harming each other on purpose or accident which means a kind of
6264120	6269000	more universal on the consideration or things like a human family is actually a real thing
6270680	6277240	so I think in order to not have a get much worse changes have to happen at a deep enough
6277240	6281320	level that it gets much better so I do think there's something like a pretty hard fork
6282680	6289480	and I think it can go either way and I think it is not determined and I think it is increasingly
6289480	6295480	potent and hard over the next while on in figuring that out so with that then the question how do
6295480	6305320	we live as the frame is I can't imagine a context in which one's choices could matter more
6305320	6309160	than that
6315960	6323320	indeed it gives a whole another level and depth and dimension to
6325640	6331000	the choices we make and the priorities we serve and the
6331480	6339320	how we live our lives and offer our lives and so what what are some of the parameters for an
6339320	6342840	effective contributing life that you see
6343000	6361960	a few more resources that I'll offer here another short little blog I wrote on how to live a meaningful life
6363640	6368600	which was intentionally not answering the question what is the meaning of life which we discussed
6368680	6373480	earlier but it said had a meaningful life and it's just
6376120	6379720	it's a way of talking about it there's lots of ways of talking about it that's not particularly
6379720	6386360	better than lots of other ways but I there's something that is kind of comprehensive and
6386360	6393800	kind of elegant about it so I'll offer it and it was looking at the mode of being
6394760	6401000	the mode of doing and the mode of becoming all being relevant and defining all of them in terms
6401000	6405960	of beauty and that thing we said earlier that truth and goodness matter because beauty is
6407800	6415400	so there it says the mode of being at its essence is about really deeply taking in the beauty of
6415400	6421880	reality and appreciating it giving gratitude for it honoring and loving it you know all those things
6422840	6425400	it's the essence of what the mode of being is really about
6427240	6433400	and that the mode of doing is about being in service to the beauty of reality protecting
6433400	6440040	it adding to it and the mode of becoming is deepening the capacity for being in doing
6441000	6447720	that I can appreciate ever more fully and that I can add to it ever more fully
6447960	6452760	and that a meaningful life is a recursive relationship between those three
6455160	6460120	and if what I'm doing isn't arising out of everything's fucked up so I have to fix everything
6460120	6465800	but it's arising out of perceiving working on this hunger issue because we're perceiving the
6465800	6470680	utter meaningfulness and beauty of these kids or these people in their life and the importance of
6470680	6477560	it and the and so then the doing the desire to serve and protect arises not from the perception
6477560	6482920	of all the badness but actually arises from the perception of the beauty from which the good
6482920	6488600	which also means the bad is framed at all right so the thing that really is terrible and pisses us
6488600	6494520	off is because something that is beautiful and sacred is being harmed which then brings us back
6494520	6499400	to there's something that we actually love and have devotion to so we trace it back to that and say
6499480	6503720	how do I be in service there so the doing must arise from the being
6505560	6511720	and the becoming is I don't just want to perceive the beauty I currently see I want to perceive
6512920	6519320	ever deeper dimensions of things that I had missed you know I want to ask what aspects of the
6519320	6524520	of reality are important and beautiful that I'm missing that other people are noticing that I'm
6524600	6531720	not honoring as fully as I could and then similarly with our doing where do I have frameworks for what
6531720	6537400	I'm where is what I'm doing coming from ego and trauma and wounding where have I been running a
6537400	6542120	strategy so long if I stopped and thought about it from scratch and I come up with something better
6542120	6552120	you know like I want to be deepening the doing as well so I think if one relates to appreciating
6552120	6556680	the beauty of life adding to it deepening the capacity for both that's a nice framework to start
6559560	6564200	and then there was another resource but on there called Dharma inquiry which is more personal
6564200	6569560	because that's obviously true for everybody the Dharma inquiry it's more into specific
6570200	6577320	things one is bothered by and is inspired by and has aptitude at and is called to to have a sense of
6578200	6584920	what is your unique relationship to that is your own Dharma with it I realized that
6586680	6590920	there's something both very beautiful about the kind of bodhisattva direction and something
6590920	6597640	that is incomplete about a certain direction of it I was I was incredibly influenced by
6598600	6603560	the value of the bodhisattva and the may I become whatever is needed and
6605560	6611400	when you look around and try to perceive what is needed and try to develop within yourself
6611400	6618360	what can offer something there I remember the the first time I actually read it was in Alex Gray's
6619160	6624920	art book the sacred mirrors and he had the heavy look page for the painting and then he had this
6625000	6629240	poem next to it it's so beautiful and it said something like where there is
6632200	6637960	thirst may rain fall upon the people and may I myself become that rain or there is hunger may
6637960	6641560	I be transformed into the food but near them where there is illness may I become the medicine
6641560	6650200	you know wherever there is need of any kind may I become what is needed I think that helps one to
6650280	6655080	recognize that what they love is deeper to who they are than who they think they are
6656440	6661560	beautiful because I think I like these things and I don't like these things I'm good at these
6661560	6668280	things not these things but oh I can't help with that because I'm not a legal scholar or I'm not
6668280	6672520	a construction worker or I'm not a whatever it is and yeah it's like but if that's the thing
6672520	6678600	that is most needed and would help what you care about most can you can you become something that
6678600	6683800	you are not and I've had many times where there was something that I was not good at that I actually
6683800	6689080	really identified as a thing I would never want to be good at and realized that it actually
6689080	6693560	mattered what I cared about enough that if I held that limited identity I was not in maximum
6693560	6699080	service to what I claimed to care about and I had to get like well I I care about what I care about
6699080	6706040	so long as it fits with my identity easily or I've got to transcend the identity so that's
6706040	6710840	what I like about the vow of the bodhisattva but where it's missing something is
6713480	6719480	I really am not equally good at all the things that are needed nor can I do all of the things
6719480	6727640	even if I try there's a lot of people have to do all the things so if medicine work is needed and if
6727640	6732360	economics change is needed and if care of the individual people and animals is needed as well
6732360	6740120	as macro systemic thinking about systems to do that not only what is most needed but what is most
6740120	6747480	needed that my being is well developed to be able to be in service to is important and so the
6747480	6754680	Dharma questions are trying to help hone that for people. Beautiful and and you're pointing to
6755560	6762200	the kinds of questions we need to ask ourselves in order to in order to orient ourselves
6762200	6768200	to be most effective instruments of service or for the and in the bodhisattva aspiration for
6768200	6774280	the welfare and awakening of all and I really think that probably that bodhisattva aspiration
6774280	6780840	may be one of the highest ideals in mind as human mind has ever come up with and such a beautiful
6780840	6785800	thing and you're pointing now to the questions we ask which the first question that emerges is
6785800	6791640	well what what can I do but then you're pointing to the idea that there's a there are questions
6791640	6800200	deeper than that what's the most effective thing I can do and along with that the question or the
6800200	6809720	colon actually what am I called to do and deeper still in your implication is is a question how
6809720	6816440	can I live my life so as to be an optimal instrument of service and each of those is I think better
6816440	6823000	thought of as a as a colon or a wisdom question and I would draw the distinction saying a conceptual
6823000	6828600	question is you know is it raining outside take a look no end of question but wisdom questions are
6828600	6832200	more like columns every time you ask them they have the potential for taking you deeper into the
6832200	6838520	question deeper into life deeper into yourself and so you're pointing us towards the real the
6838520	6844680	wisdom questions of our time. I would also say that almost every value or principle
6846520	6854040	lives in a dialectical relationship with another value or principle that is complementary but
6854040	6861320	they might seem almost opposite and that without holding them together the full version of just
6861320	6868600	that one thing the reducto ad absurdum of it actually becomes evil and so this is the everything
6868680	6878280	can be a medicine or everything can be a poison topic so what is
6881240	6888120	what is my unique self calling what is that which I can offer the world based on the unique
6888120	6894360	set of experiences and capacities I have that no one else could offer that if I spend my life doing
6894360	6900440	things other than that that other people could do the most novel offering that I have doesn't occur
6901640	6906040	that's a deep and important and beautiful question but taken to its extreme it'll make
6906040	6911560	you a total shithead because fucking do the dishes when you need to do the dishes no it's not your
6911560	6916360	unique self the only thing that you can do like anybody can do the dishes or take out the trash
6916360	6923640	but like damn though a lot of life is just doing the dishes out of the trash and maybe the unique
6923640	6931720	self that you have is is unexpressible infinitesimal qualities with which you show up to those things
6931720	6941720	you know so the what is uniquely mine to do that no one else can do and what fucking needs done
6941720	6946600	that nobody wants to do I'll just show up to you got to hold those together right because also on
6946600	6950920	the other side if you always just say what is nobody what is the shittiest job that nobody
6950920	6955640	wants to do let me show up to that which is an incredibly ennobling question incredibly beautiful
6955640	6966520	question you can also end up uh failing at some unique self darmism capacities you could have
6966520	6977720	because of only orienting that way and so uh every every principle and every virtue needs held in a
6977720	6984120	dialectical relationship and not over normed as absolute yeah and this is the ancient concept
6984120	6991880	of the interdependence of virtues that that they require require each other and complement one
6991880	6997560	one another and I think you're also pointing to the contextual nature of our inquiries that we
6997560	7006360	have to keep the context as well so again beautiful beautiful reflections and deepening and expanding
7006680	7012520	uh that I see you're pointing us to yeah and I've I've just felt that we've been spending
7013400	7017800	I don't know extra amount of time in the heart of philosophy and I feel a connection with
7017800	7023800	fidgety triathlons and all of that stuff has started long ago in another land and it's still
7024760	7034040	it's still churning and a universe that can produce um a you and a me I can't be all bad
7034040	7044200	and I feel deeply moved and deeply uh renewed in my commitment to do my little things you know
7044200	7049720	whatever that calling might be and I think I pretty much found that but also to shampoo my dog
7049720	7056200	and take out the trash and you know wipe the counters and that sort of thing you know and
7056200	7061160	you say it can't be all bad it's funny because so I focus on the meta crisis which is like all the
7061160	7065800	most fucked up stuff that could be all together um it kind of seems like that but it's not really
7065800	7081000	what I focus on I mean it's in appreciation and love of this world and life there's the desire to
7082200	7087880	protect it and uh so paying attention to things that need protecting but where does the motivation
7087960	7091720	come from the motivation doesn't come things being fucked up the motivation comes from the
7092520	7101560	wonder of it right from the beauty of it like I've had I know you you both talk about bringing
7101560	7108040	the philosophic concepts into daily practice on this um show a lot and you know I've had a lot of
7108040	7113880	practices throughout my life in terms of types of meditation types of inquiry and whatever
7114840	7120920	but like I wake up in the morning and the first thing I do pretty much every morning is I just
7120920	7125400	look out the window at the trees and I just watch the trees move in the wind for a little bit
7126760	7134440	and I don't I don't have to try to care about them or try to find them beautiful they're just
7134440	7139400	fucking beautiful and there's a happiness that comes just watching that and then there's a
7139400	7144440	gratitude to be alive and consciousness you know arising again and there's a happiness to be on this
7144440	7150760	planet and then there is a because of the happiness it comes from just the perception of the beauty
7150760	7155640	of it I don't need that much for myself right there's not an unhappiness it needs me to do a
7155640	7162520	bunch of stuff and then there's this gratitude that I like I was sleeping this con this Daniel
7162520	7167640	consciousness wasn't here and then it boots again and now it's here and I think about when Daniel's
7167640	7175080	dead the consciousness that will be perceiving the world and falling in love for the first time and
7175080	7180440	climbing trees and reading hafez and rumi for the first time it's all the things and I can't
7180440	7185480	not feel connected to those consciousnesses a hundred and a thousand years from it like I can't
7185480	7191560	not feel what it feels like to perceive through those eyes and I'm actually not trying to get it
7191560	7199160	to go anywhere I just want that kids get to keep experiencing falling in love with trees for the
7199160	7202920	first time and mothers get to keep falling in love with their kids and people get to fall in love and do
7204520	7210360	poetry for the first time and get heartbroken and all the things the pot like it is intrinsically
7210360	7218040	already meaningful without going anywhere and it's already beautiful and you know one of the other
7218040	7222280	things I know you'll have talked about is peak experiences and one of the things I always felt is
7224920	7226520	once you have had one of them
7231160	7237640	like for me I remember I remember discreetly I've talked about before there was this one time I
7237640	7244200	was watching a sunset and writing poetry to nature and watching a sunset as a teenager
7245000	7249960	and I remember the sunset was just so incredibly beautiful and I remember thinking
7251480	7256040	if I had the choice if there is a spirit before this life if I had the choice to come here and
7256040	7259800	incarnate and go through whatever painful things that I've went through my whole life just to get
7259800	7267480	to have this one experience of color and vision and the wind and the insects in this moment would
7267480	7272600	totally do it like I would take every pain in my whole life to have had this experience as opposed to
7272600	7280920	no experience and then I'm like I've had that I've had so many of these experiences and one of
7280920	7287640	them is worth incarnating for I've had so many of them and so it's like the fact that I will probably
7287640	7294440	have more of them is gravy and it's like a ridiculous beauty and abundance but that every
7294440	7298360	that future life gets to keep having those and that other people get to have more of those is kind
7298360	7306200	of more what I'm motivated by and they make us better persons when we experience those things
7306200	7313720	that it shifts you know something happens maybe just a little bit but something happens in a
7313720	7319000	positive thing and shifts in our soul and our interiors and maybe we behave a little a little
7319000	7324200	better or a lot better I'm not sure I think the what's in it for me thing chills out
7324200	7330760	you know and it's not that it doesn't reboot because we're complex people with lots of parts
7330760	7335640	and there will be a pain body that reboots and so it's not like enlightenment is a static thing
7335640	7340920	and you have a satori and then you never have a pain body boot again it does but there's something
7340920	7349080	about even just thinking about it and just being like I there could have been no I no experience at
7349080	7355720	all and there's experience and there've been such amazing ones and
7359880	7364840	and and I feel this pretty much with every difficulty or trauma too is like when you've
7364840	7370440	done the healing work with it you don't still feel messed up by the trauma or the pain but you do feel
7371240	7378760	ongoingly benefited by the lessons and it's kind of like a lot of people don't have the
7378760	7382520	resources or know how to do the healing so they never get the lessons and they're just always
7382520	7387400	affected by the pain and that's a bummer but if one kind of has the resources knows how to work
7387400	7393080	on it then the pain is temporary and the gifts are lasting and it's like this just beneficial
7393080	7398760	asymmetry like this beautiful asymmetry where it's like yeah I just am a yes to the whole thing
7398760	7406120	let's say yes to the whole thing and there's there's a beautiful couple of lines that came out of
7406120	7413160	San Quentin prison uh there's a project uh grip guiding rage into pain which uh the people work
7413160	7419240	very intensely with with people many of them life as many of them have been murderers and
7420040	7424920	work on life transformation their ideals the body sight for aspiration the commitment is
7425480	7430840	even if I stay in my in the prison for the rest of my life I'm going to do what I can to help people
7431640	7438840	and one and one of them after after and there's a very intensive exploration of their pain and
7438840	7444920	the trauma they've both caused and received and these are very traumatized people and there's a
7444920	7451320	video of one of these sessions in which one of the one of the prisoners some suddenly lights out
7451320	7457720	lights up and says oh I get it hurt people hurt people and healed people heal people
7458600	7465960	it's like oh oh it's so beautiful yeah they're both self-propagating
7467480	7476200	yeah I would love to explore that with you Daniel uh we've gone long and far and deep or maybe that's
7476200	7481720	the wrong word uh to explore the the darkness and the addiction and the way out of that and just
7481720	7488440	what you said um Roger uh hurt people hurt people and heal people heal people and that's uh
7489480	7496360	maybe that's a good place to wrap it uh for this evening I really enjoyed the conversation with
7496360	7502600	both of you I think that the this podcast where you're exploring these topics and sharing it with
7502600	7510680	people is uh a really beautiful service and I'm honored to be here with you oh it's such a delight
7510680	7517400	Daniel and it's such a such a gift to be able to investigate at this depth and co-explore so
7518040	7525080	thank you so much for this gift to to everyone who listens to the podcast and thank you so much
7525080	7530520	for your life's work it's truly a gift crisis we get to share this with thousands and thousands
7530520	7535480	of god knows how many people that's tremendous that's just tremendous if there is a second time
7535480	7542280	we come back to and explore that hurt people hurt people that there is some
7543720	7550200	autopoetic trauma force almost and that there is also some kind of autopoetic healing or integrative
7550200	7554600	force but if you wanted to think of the light and dark sides of the force that's actually kind of a
7554600	7561880	good way of thinking of it is the autopropagation of those things um and we wanted to explore that
7561880	7568280	sometime maybe also if the listeners have thoughts or questions or topics coming from this that can
7568280	7575560	inform it we can get to those next time too right well we hereby extend an invitation to
7575560	7581320	listeners to let us know the questions you have for Daniel and uh I think you're implicitly
7581320	7586120	suggesting you're open to coming back and we of course would love that and I know how listeners
7586120	7592440	would too so that's beautiful and again in regards to your father and mom if they're still
7592440	7597400	on this plane and if not in regards to them anyway okay tell tell them they they deeply
7597400	7603160	touch one old guy in Louisiana made a difference for him I'll send this podcast to them when it
7603160	7620200	publishes Daniel thank you so much take care
