Processing Overview for Zach Star
============================
Checking Zach Star/Curves we (mostly) don't learn in high school (and applications).txt
1. **Geodesics**: The shortest path between two points on a curved surface is called a geodesic. It's not always a straight line, unlike on a flat plane. Geodesics are particularly important in general relativity, where they describe the paths of objects moving under their own inertia without acceleration, such as photons traveling through space-time.

2. **Cycloid**: A special type of geodesic is the cycloid, which is the path traced by a point on the rim of a rolling circle. It's notable for its smoothness and predictable behavior, and it's also the curve that minimizes the integral of kinetic energy minus potential energy along it, assuming constant total time.

3. **Minimization Problem**: The problem of finding the curve that connects two points with the minimum sum of kinetic energy minus potential energy over time leads to the geodesic on a flat surface (a straight line). This is an application of the calculus of variations.

4. **Applications of Geodesics**: In practical applications, geodesics can be used to determine the shortest path on curved surfaces, like finding the best route along a cylinder or sphere.

5. **Einstein's General Theory of Relativity**: Geodesics are fundamental in Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. Photons follow geodesics in this curved spacetime.

6. **CuriosityStream**: A platform that offers documentaries and nonfiction titles across a wide range of subjects, including mathematics and its applications in the real world, like chaos theory. CuriosityStream has a vast library with thousands of titles available on various platforms for $2.99 per month, and new subscribers can try it for free for the first month by using the promo code Zach Star at curiositystream.com/ZachStar.
