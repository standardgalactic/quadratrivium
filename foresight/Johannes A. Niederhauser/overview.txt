Checking Johannes A. Niederhauser/Plato： The Beautiful is the Good ｜ by Thomas Jockin.txt
 In this introduction to a persuasive speech or course on Plato's concept of the beautiful, the speaker outlines the significance of understanding the various terms and philosophical concepts related to beauty as perceived by Plato. The key terms discussed are "morphē," "eidos," "paradigma," and "kōnos," each representing different aspects of the forms or ideas that Plato believed were the true reality behind the physical world we experience.

The speaker emphasizes that Plato's approach to dialectic is more inductive and concerned with the making activities that contribute to knowledge, rather than a simple top-down imposition of rational definitions. This perspective challenges the common stereotype of Plato as solely a rationalist.

The course is designed for two main types of learners:
1. Artists or practitioners in any field who wish to explore philosophy to deepen their understanding and practice, finding connections between their craft and philosophical inquiry.
2. Individuals seeking to live an authentic and virtuous life, recognizing that the beauty in the world can shape the soul and lead to a true sense of happiness.

The speaker invites learners to join in exploring these concepts through Plato's "Hippias Major," where they will reconsider their common notions of beauty and delve into the questions of what beauty is, who understands it, how it affects the soul, and how it can be known and loved. The course aims to inspire a genuine inquiry into the mysteries of beauty and virtue.

The speaker concludes by expressing confidence that engaging with these philosophical ideas will enrich the learners' understanding and lead to a delightful self-discovery process.
