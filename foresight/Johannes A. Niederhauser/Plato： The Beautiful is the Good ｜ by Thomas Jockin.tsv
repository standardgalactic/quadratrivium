0	9680	So, welcome to this introduction recording of our lecture series, The Beautiful and Virtue.
9680	12640	A study in Six Platonic Dialogues.
12640	16840	Now before I begin with these prepared, my prepared introduction essay, I want to first
16840	24080	say thank you for taking the time to sign up for the course and spend the next several
24080	32120	weeks with me in investigating Plato's early dialogues on the topics of the beautiful,
32120	34840	in particular, and the virtue.
34840	37120	There's a lot of things you could be doing with your time.
37120	41400	You could be spending your time hiking or leisure activities like watching movies or
41400	47560	spending time with loved ones, but instead you chose to take the time to go through
47560	52960	these lecture series and the discussions of dialogue with Plato.
52960	57480	And I think that's something to be commended.
57480	61400	I think it's very common to think that there's something very given.
61400	66280	We take it for granted what beauty is, but I think the reason why maybe you are in this
66280	72160	course right now and felt a calling, a resonance, to be here is that it's the simple things
72160	79200	in life that might be so given, so obvious, so explicit that with more investigation,
79200	84720	more inquiry, you realize there's a lot more subtlety and complexity going on.
84720	89960	And that's something that's worth your time, to have a life that's worth the kind of enrichment
89960	93360	that a deeper consideration will allow.
93360	97520	I want to thank you for that consideration and be given this opportunity to speak with
97520	98440	you today.
98440	104200	So with that said, hopefully this dialogue series and lecture about it will be worth
104200	108120	that investment of time, and I take that seriously, so I want to thank you for that.
108120	110720	So let's begin.
110720	120280	One morning not too long ago, I felt the urge to re-retonance Aquinas' take on honesty.
120280	123520	In particular, I read this, I was reading this account on an ostinium and was shocked
123520	126440	to what I found.
126440	132000	Now when I recall honesty, as taught by my parents, or to use the term with friends,
132000	137880	the term seems synonymous with truth telling, yet Aquinas had a completely different understanding
138640	142960	of ostinium, described in four parts in the Summa.
142960	148240	First, honesty is placed under the virtue of temperance.
148240	154360	This is unusual because temperance is a moral virtue and not intellectual virtue, which
154360	158960	we would think is related to honesty, with truth telling.
158960	163920	Second, honesty is convertible with virtue itself.
163920	168240	Now truth telling is important, I wouldn't dismiss that.
168240	175360	But it would not seem to encompass the entirety of what virtue would mean as a concept.
175360	180600	Aquinas is directing the reader to something radically different from just truth telling
180600	182560	with the term ostinium.
182560	189520	Third, honesty is not the same as the useful or the pleasant.
189520	194280	But rather something good for its own sake, a statement that's usually only reserved
194280	198520	for virtue where it said human happiness.
198520	205640	Lastly, honesty is said to be convertible with beauty.
205640	211680	And not a beauty of physical appearance, Aquinas is very clear to emphasize rather the spiritual
211680	214400	beauty of true reality.
214400	219480	It's a state of beauty of clarity and perfected existence.
219480	225480	All at once as I'm reading Aquinas' account on ostinium, I understood the power of Plato's
225480	226800	work.
226800	231920	Centuries later, the long shadow of Plato's writing on the beautiful has been cast on
231920	235680	this 12th century Dominican writing.
235680	238440	And that long shadow does not stop at Aquinas.
238440	244040	When I recall the Heidegger's account on authentic existence as care, I continue to
244040	251760	sense Plato's shadow continued to stretch over time well into the 20th century.
251760	257640	Now this lecture series is going to consider how, for Plato, beauty ascends the beloved
257640	261320	from appearances to true realities.
261320	266280	This is a shocking assertion because since Kant's beauty has been treated as a personal
266280	271000	preference on the same level as a favorite ice cream flavor.
271000	276840	How could a subjective preference move a pupil from appearances to true reality?
276840	284600	This is a question of pedagogy, of epistemology, and just kind of reason discourse.
284600	288920	When would a preference ever change a person's entire orientation to reality?
288920	297480	So now we have a question of ethics and how to live the good life.
297480	304040	Consider how if we considered beauty as this vehicle, as the level of a preference for
304040	307160	ice cream flavor, how could that possibly be the case?
307160	309000	I would not think so.
309000	315040	Instead, in this course, we return to the foundation of thought in Plato and see what
315040	319200	other mode of beauty we could consider.
319200	325240	Now join me in this six module seminar as a journey within the platonic dialogues that
325240	328920	approach the beautiful and virtue.
328920	336080	If this is the first time you're encountering me, I hold a BFA in communication design from
336080	339000	Parsons School of Design.
339000	343840	Since 2015, I have worked with corporations such as Starbucks, Foot Locker, Express, and
343840	347120	Google on various design projects.
347120	357440	I have taught either as a lecturer or as a professor in various educational centers
357440	362840	on design, such in New York City, such as School of Visual Arts, Pratt Institute, Parsons
362840	366960	School of Design, the Fashion Institute of Technology, and the City University of New
366960	367960	York.
367960	374880	In 2021, I co-authored with Javier Rivera and OG Rose the book, A Philosophy of Glimpses,
374880	377240	available on Amazon.
377240	382280	I am thankful for this opportunity with the Halkion Guild that has provided to me to speak
382280	384800	with you today.
384800	389640	My time with design students focuses on drawing forth the beauty inside their sketches and
389640	390880	prototypes.
390880	396760	With my students, we worked out with the first principles of art and design, the hidden fulfillment
396760	400000	of what is possible inside their work.
400000	406320	Now while such practical practices are very rewarding, because the first principles, in
406320	412040	this case for design beauty, is taken for granted, I have always felt like the opportunity
412040	417120	to really investigate and discuss beauty was always lacking in these institutions, which
417120	419080	is ironic.
419080	424480	A different context of inquiry is required to think about these first principles.
424480	431120	Now with the Halkion Guild, we will explore the in Six Platonic Dialogues with the particular
431120	434760	contemplation of the beautiful and virtue.
434760	441600	The six dialogues we will read together are, Greater Hippias, Symposium, Phaedrus, Nino,
441600	444800	Pratilis, and Permanides.
444800	450280	I have structured the course in such a manner so that as we read these dialogues, we will
450280	453720	circumscribe the following considerations.
453720	459800	We start with Greater Hippias, with the typical Alencus method of knocking down the Sophists
459800	465640	Hippias's particular examples of the beautiful, followed by Socrates' hypothetical replies
465640	470840	to what the definition of the beautiful would be, albeit with failure.
470840	476120	In fact, from the exchanges between Hippias and Socrates, the connection between predicates
476120	479240	and their subjects begin to untether.
479240	486000	From Symposium, we will explore what is love as a predicate and how beauty interacts with
486000	494240	love, in the words spoken by Socrates, to behold true realities that nourish true virtue.
494240	498840	In Phaedrus, Plato presents two shocking notions to us.
498840	503240	First, that predicates are a hierarchy of excessive desire.
503240	510120	Second, the virtue of temperance is the acquired opinion to desire the best.
510120	516400	Contending with Nino, we will attempt to thread the concepts of beauty, excellence, knowledge,
516400	519240	and action into a woven hole.
519240	524040	From Pratilis, Revelations await us.
524040	530720	Plato suggests the very instruments of knowledge, names, is in fact images that are nothing
530720	536120	like the realities they purport to depict in a transparent reality.
536120	541360	If this is the case, the standard critique of image makers by Plato, and dialogues such
541360	549480	as the Republic, seem to extend even to words, let alone images of the poets.
549480	552800	How can we reconcile this apparent tension?
552800	555840	We read together to find out.
555840	562600	Lastly, we continue to circumscribe the path with permittities, one of the more enigmatic
562600	565020	dialogues of Plato.
565020	572120	After demolishing Socrates' notion of forms, images and likeness are explored to point
572120	577320	the way to a rehabilitated conception of the beautiful.
577320	582040	When I introduce philosophy to my design students, I begin with a topic of aritse, which can
582040	585800	be translated to excellence or virtue.
585960	591960	Most of my students have never heard of the concept in a design context.
591960	594240	This was the case of my own education.
594240	600760	This collapse of aesthetic deliberation into personal preference is my suggestion why excellence
600760	604040	is never spoken of in the classroom when you would seem to be the most obvious place to
604040	605520	talk about it.
605520	611520	Instead, what if we can reconsider virtue not as a cultural subject of preference, let
611520	617960	alone as a visual preference, but rather as a beautiful activity, then we can begin
617960	625160	to see with a vantage point of reality pregnant with possibility and energy is what I suggest.
625160	633480	As I tell my students, writing is like writing, both in prose and poetry, when done well
633480	639380	presents to the viewer a reality, albeit in different modes, which complement one another.
639380	645100	For example, when we ask the question, does this artifact do a function, that only really
645100	651420	entails a reality of engineering, whereas if we ask the question, does this artifact
651420	657620	function with beauty, we're now asking a very different question with very different answers.
657620	660340	The answer such an inquiry is vastly different.
660340	667180	It is not a formulaic repetition of the same answer no matter the context, but instead it's
667300	672180	when done well and with beauty a creative living dance.
672180	675940	My own experience as a design student is an example of this.
675940	681740	In my sophomore typography class, I was instructed by a typeface designer named Joshua Darden.
681740	686180	As I recall, almost 20 years later, what I thought at the end of that first class with
686180	690660	Darden, I went to mind as beautiful as his.
690660	695140	I immediately recognized in that first lecture Joshua's intellectual powers, perceptions
695140	699420	and considerations and fell in love with what I was beholding.
699420	704700	I was then Joshua's apprentice for three years after this inaugural course.
704700	710460	It is funny to think that in one lecture directed my entire understanding of what design could
710460	713740	be and how my life was to unfold.
713740	722240	At 19 years old, my entire orientation to life was reshaped by an encounter of the beautiful.
722240	727100	My life was shaped by that beauty and that acted upon me and compelled me towards a beloved.
727100	731600	And this is important, it's not a beloved of the body of some physicality of some kind,
731600	735200	but rather a beauty of an activity of the soul.
735200	737560	This is one of the things we will explore together.
737560	741760	Plato is very empathetic about the point, demonstrates that beauty, there are many kinds
741760	742960	of beauty.
742960	746840	The beauty of living bodies, such as maidens and horses are beautiful.
746840	750120	There is the beauty of the activities of the soul, such as my mentor's thought process
750120	754080	and typography, but there is more still.
754080	758640	There is the beauty of virtue itself, such as 42 in charity, the beauty of laws and institutions
758640	766440	and even higher still, all of which seem to abide under some unity named the beautiful.
766440	770800	I would like you to consider if the beautiful we encounter in our lives is also not just
770800	774680	some generic conceptual abstraction.
774680	781200	For example, it is not sunsets that are beautiful, it's this sunset you are beholding that is
781200	782600	beautiful.
782600	787560	Maidens are not beautiful as an abstraction, this maiden before you is beautiful, this
787560	792200	act of charity you witness is beautiful, this law enacted is beautiful.
792200	799560	In all these examples, beauty seems to direct us to the hexity, the thinness of an entity.
799560	805520	Yet also beauty seems to point us to something universal beyond the particular individual
805520	807600	present in front of us.
807600	812000	The many in the one is expressed in the beautiful.
812000	816920	I ask you to join me in these readings of the Six Platonic Dialogues to find out the consequences
816920	820320	of such a conception of the beautiful.
820320	825040	Our understanding of images and likeness also requires a more profound thought if we wish
825040	831240	to grasp what Plato means by beauty without figure or color.
831240	834080	We need another look at likeness.
834080	838960	Likeness as mimicry is the standard explanation of beauty in the arts.
838960	845760	The drawing of a person is beautiful when it best mimics the actual person before it as
845760	846760	a subject.
846760	853920	I suggest in this lecture series that mimicry of nature does not exhaust the beautiful.
853920	860520	As Carl Jung says, quoting the alchemists, what nature leaps in perfect are perfects.
860520	863760	Consider how does a name mimic the thing named?
863760	870680	In what manner is a written named dog, composed of sounds and marks on a page, anything like
870680	872120	an actual dog?
872120	876040	We have to admit there is no likeness in sound or figure.
876040	880040	Likeness as mimicry is lacking as an explanation.
880040	884680	Using my points, the convertibility of goodness and beauty is a puzzle we will attend to in
884680	886360	this seminar series.
886360	891320	One of the readings in one reading of these dialogues from Plato, you could conclude,
891320	896040	as Tolstoy did, that goodness and beauty are one in the same concept collapsed into the
896040	897740	notion of pleasure.
897740	901000	But such a conclusion does not exhaust all possible answers.
901000	906840	The phrase goodness is the same as beauty entails acknowledging some differences.
906840	911280	Now that difference could be one of phonemes or sounds that make up the name, so for example,
911280	917280	beauty and jamal in Arabic posit the same notion, but in different languages, depicted
917280	922360	by in other, in different markings that map on a different sounds.
922360	926520	Or that difference between goodness and beauty could be a difference in relation under a
926520	927520	subject.
927520	931840	For example, a good chair is different from the good man sitting on that chair.
931840	937000	For most ecmatically, the difference between goodness and beauty could be one of analogy.
937000	939900	To explain what I mean, let me give you an example.
939900	946280	What exactly are we saying when we speak of the term liquid capital or cash flow?
946280	951560	When we use the term liquid in these cases, we tend to think of entities such as water,
951560	955080	yet capital is nothing like water.
955080	960120	Capital is a promise imposed onto some material, be it paper with ink or zeros and ones on electrical
960120	961120	current.
961400	969640	Water is a particular arrangement imposed onto hydrogen and oxygen atoms.
969640	976800	In both form and material, capital and water are nothing alike, yet the analogy of liquid
976800	981720	posits a real and common reality to both entities.
981720	987280	And I mean real reality, actual reality, not figures of speech because economists deploy
987440	992960	liquid dynamics, which describes water, to make falsifiable predictions related to finance
992960	993960	and capital.
993960	1000080	Rather, whether the difference between goodness and beauty is one of sounds, relation to a
1000080	1005800	subject, or analogy, is something we will need to investigate together.
1005800	1011640	Much of our work together is to help uncover the deeper meanings of phrases and words that
1011640	1016280	have become collapsed or buried over the development of philosophy.
1016280	1018280	The term is such a word.
1018280	1024760	What is translated a form, figure, pattern, arrangement, is in fact referring to paradigma,
1024760	1028880	eidos, merfe, schemata, or taxes, for example.
1028880	1034600	These are not the same idea, but instead a hierarchy of reality.
1034600	1039120	Aerosol uses taxes and rhetoric to refer to the composition of unlike elements arranged
1039120	1043320	together to make a whole of a persuasive speech.
1043320	1048680	He also uses schemata to reference the shape of unnatural kinds bound together, whereas
1048680	1054160	the term morphae is used for natural types like animals and dogs and humans, for example.
1054160	1060360	Eidos, which may be translated as species, can, to aria be a sematic category, whereas
1060360	1065840	for the Greeks, eidos was ontological, rather than sematic.
1065840	1070280	Within Sufi philosophy, you could make a suggestion of this form of appearance to reality, could
1070280	1077120	map onto eidos and morphae distinctions, but that might more to the point of why disentangling
1077120	1081280	form is a worthwhile venture, for better understanding.
1081280	1087800	Lastly, paradigma points to what later thinkers such as Aquinas would call the exemplar cause
1087800	1094160	of a thing, the isolated entity which illustrates the first principle within the mind of the
1094160	1095960	maker.
1095960	1102720	Where Aquinas states the exemplars are in the mind, Plato saw paradigma as a much more
1102720	1106880	authentic and singular reality outside of minds.
1106880	1111360	A more rigorous understanding of these terms will likewise aid our understanding of the
1111360	1114440	beautiful for Plato.
1114440	1119560	The dichotomy between a recitalian and platonic thought is due for reconsideration.
1119560	1124960	Rather than the top-down rationality count of Plato, it is my hope as we review these
1124960	1131280	dialogues together, that the variable-making arts at a particular time play a large role
1131280	1133280	in Plato's arguments.
1133280	1142160	This is different from the singular mind-hunting of definitions of concepts with ignorant interlaculars
1142160	1146680	for some inert substance such as what is piety or what is courage.
1146680	1151360	Indeed, seeing Plato arrange the dialogues in such a manner so as to esteem the making
1151360	1156760	activities that bootstrap knowledge is a very different experience of dialectic.
1156760	1162440	Much more inductive than the top-down rationalist depictions of Plato would permit.
1162440	1168560	If Plato truly is a top-down thinker, then why does Plato's character Socrates repeatedly
1168560	1174680	recite the work of doctors, craftsmen, and gymnasts to refute the claims of his speaking
1174680	1176360	partners?
1176360	1180200	Something is going on counter to the stereotype.
1180200	1186080	To summarize the section so far, our inquiry into the beautiful will instruct us in four
1186080	1187080	major topics.
1187080	1192920	First, the motivation of pupils under the topic of desire, second, pedagogy under the
1192920	1198880	topic of rhetoric, followed by epistemology under the topic of love, lastly, the nature
1198880	1204680	of reality is to be studied under the topic of images and resemblances.
1204680	1208280	This course is for several kinds of readers.
1208360	1215040	First, this course is for those who come from an artistic practice and wish to explore philosophy.
1215040	1221240	By reconsidering what is beauty, artists may deepen their practice with such an investigation.
1221240	1226040	Philosophy can be daunting, especially if you attempt to re-contemporary thinkers.
1226040	1229720	The terms are technical and are different from common meanings that you would find in
1229720	1234600	the dictionary and are very loaded with a long tradition.
1234600	1240400	But by starting with Plato under the beautiful virtue, you will have a gateway to connect
1240400	1245520	and enliven your professional practice with the methods and language of philosophy.
1245520	1249320	The second kind of learner in this course is for those who wish to have a more steady
1249320	1251960	footing for the authentic life.
1251960	1256760	As I spoke with Johannes in a discussion you can find on YouTube, we cannot simply copy
1256760	1263360	paste the ways of thinking of the past and bring it to today.
1263360	1265760	Our world is different from the past.
1265760	1270520	Our constraints, our dangers and our opportunities are not alike to that time.
1270520	1276120	Instead, we need to reach not for the duplication or mimicry of the past, but rather bring
1276120	1280760	forth a new image of how to live well.
1280760	1287920	The beautiful is how I believe we can begin to achieve this authentic life of a true happiness.
1287920	1292760	If you are such a learner, join me in the Halkion Guild to meditate on the following
1292760	1294520	questions.
1294520	1296400	What is the beautiful?
1296400	1299520	Who understands and enacts beauty?
1299520	1303720	What does beauty shape in the soul?
1303720	1307000	How do we come to know and love beauty in the world?
1307000	1311720	And lastly, where does a love for virtue come from?
1311720	1316120	I look forward to our approach towards the mysteries that surround both the beautiful
1316120	1317120	and virtue.
1317320	1322000	I am confident you will be delighted by what springs forth inside yourself by the sincere
1322000	1325080	inquiry into the beautiful.
1325080	1330720	We will begin our inquiry with the dialogue greater hippiest, where our common suggestions
1330720	1333040	of what is beauty is to be reconsidered.
1333040	1333760	I'll see you all then.
