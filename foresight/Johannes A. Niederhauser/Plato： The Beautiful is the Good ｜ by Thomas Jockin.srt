1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,680
So, welcome to this introduction recording of our lecture series, The Beautiful and Virtue.

2
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,640
A study in Six Platonic Dialogues.

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,840
Now before I begin with these prepared, my prepared introduction essay, I want to first

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:24,080
say thank you for taking the time to sign up for the course and spend the next several

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:32,120
weeks with me in investigating Plato's early dialogues on the topics of the beautiful,

6
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,840
in particular, and the virtue.

7
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,120
There's a lot of things you could be doing with your time.

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,400
You could be spending your time hiking or leisure activities like watching movies or

9
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:47,560
spending time with loved ones, but instead you chose to take the time to go through

10
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:52,960
these lecture series and the discussions of dialogue with Plato.

11
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,480
And I think that's something to be commended.

12
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,400
I think it's very common to think that there's something very given.

13
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:06,280
We take it for granted what beauty is, but I think the reason why maybe you are in this

14
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:12,160
course right now and felt a calling, a resonance, to be here is that it's the simple things

15
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:19,200
in life that might be so given, so obvious, so explicit that with more investigation,

16
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,720
more inquiry, you realize there's a lot more subtlety and complexity going on.

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,960
And that's something that's worth your time, to have a life that's worth the kind of enrichment

18
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,360
that a deeper consideration will allow.

19
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,520
I want to thank you for that consideration and be given this opportunity to speak with

20
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,440
you today.

21
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:44,200
So with that said, hopefully this dialogue series and lecture about it will be worth

22
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,120
that investment of time, and I take that seriously, so I want to thank you for that.

23
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,720
So let's begin.

24
00:01:50,720 --> 00:02:00,280
One morning not too long ago, I felt the urge to re-retonance Aquinas' take on honesty.

25
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,520
In particular, I read this, I was reading this account on an ostinium and was shocked

26
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,440
to what I found.

27
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:12,000
Now when I recall honesty, as taught by my parents, or to use the term with friends,

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,880
the term seems synonymous with truth telling, yet Aquinas had a completely different understanding

29
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,960
of ostinium, described in four parts in the Summa.

30
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:28,240
First, honesty is placed under the virtue of temperance.

31
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:34,360
This is unusual because temperance is a moral virtue and not intellectual virtue, which

32
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,960
we would think is related to honesty, with truth telling.

33
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,920
Second, honesty is convertible with virtue itself.

34
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,240
Now truth telling is important, I wouldn't dismiss that.

35
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:55,360
But it would not seem to encompass the entirety of what virtue would mean as a concept.

36
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,600
Aquinas is directing the reader to something radically different from just truth telling

37
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,560
with the term ostinium.

38
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:09,520
Third, honesty is not the same as the useful or the pleasant.

39
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,280
But rather something good for its own sake, a statement that's usually only reserved

40
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,520
for virtue where it said human happiness.

41
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:25,640
Lastly, honesty is said to be convertible with beauty.

42
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:31,680
And not a beauty of physical appearance, Aquinas is very clear to emphasize rather the spiritual

43
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,400
beauty of true reality.

44
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,480
It's a state of beauty of clarity and perfected existence.

45
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:45,480
All at once as I'm reading Aquinas' account on ostinium, I understood the power of Plato's

46
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,800
work.

47
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,920
Centuries later, the long shadow of Plato's writing on the beautiful has been cast on

48
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,680
this 12th century Dominican writing.

49
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,440
And that long shadow does not stop at Aquinas.

50
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:04,040
When I recall the Heidegger's account on authentic existence as care, I continue to

51
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:11,760
sense Plato's shadow continued to stretch over time well into the 20th century.

52
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,640
Now this lecture series is going to consider how, for Plato, beauty ascends the beloved

53
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,320
from appearances to true realities.

54
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:26,280
This is a shocking assertion because since Kant's beauty has been treated as a personal

55
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,000
preference on the same level as a favorite ice cream flavor.

56
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,840
How could a subjective preference move a pupil from appearances to true reality?

57
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:44,600
This is a question of pedagogy, of epistemology, and just kind of reason discourse.

58
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,920
When would a preference ever change a person's entire orientation to reality?

59
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:57,480
So now we have a question of ethics and how to live the good life.

60
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:04,040
Consider how if we considered beauty as this vehicle, as the level of a preference for

61
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,160
ice cream flavor, how could that possibly be the case?

62
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,000
I would not think so.

63
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,040
Instead, in this course, we return to the foundation of thought in Plato and see what

64
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,200
other mode of beauty we could consider.

65
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:25,240
Now join me in this six module seminar as a journey within the platonic dialogues that

66
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,920
approach the beautiful and virtue.

67
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:36,080
If this is the first time you're encountering me, I hold a BFA in communication design from

68
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,000
Parsons School of Design.

69
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,840
Since 2015, I have worked with corporations such as Starbucks, Foot Locker, Express, and

70
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,120
Google on various design projects.

71
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:57,440
I have taught either as a lecturer or as a professor in various educational centers

72
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,840
on design, such in New York City, such as School of Visual Arts, Pratt Institute, Parsons

73
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,960
School of Design, the Fashion Institute of Technology, and the City University of New

74
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,960
York.

75
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:14,880
In 2021, I co-authored with Javier Rivera and OG Rose the book, A Philosophy of Glimpses,

76
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,240
available on Amazon.

77
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:22,280
I am thankful for this opportunity with the Halkion Guild that has provided to me to speak

78
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,800
with you today.

79
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,640
My time with design students focuses on drawing forth the beauty inside their sketches and

80
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,880
prototypes.

81
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,760
With my students, we worked out with the first principles of art and design, the hidden fulfillment

82
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,000
of what is possible inside their work.

83
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,320
Now while such practical practices are very rewarding, because the first principles, in

84
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:52,040
this case for design beauty, is taken for granted, I have always felt like the opportunity

85
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:57,120
to really investigate and discuss beauty was always lacking in these institutions, which

86
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,080
is ironic.

87
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:04,480
A different context of inquiry is required to think about these first principles.

88
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:11,120
Now with the Halkion Guild, we will explore the in Six Platonic Dialogues with the particular

89
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,760
contemplation of the beautiful and virtue.

90
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:21,600
The six dialogues we will read together are, Greater Hippias, Symposium, Phaedrus, Nino,

91
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,800
Pratilis, and Permanides.

92
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,280
I have structured the course in such a manner so that as we read these dialogues, we will

93
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,720
circumscribe the following considerations.

94
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:39,800
We start with Greater Hippias, with the typical Alencus method of knocking down the Sophists

95
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:45,640
Hippias's particular examples of the beautiful, followed by Socrates' hypothetical replies

96
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:50,840
to what the definition of the beautiful would be, albeit with failure.

97
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:56,120
In fact, from the exchanges between Hippias and Socrates, the connection between predicates

98
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,240
and their subjects begin to untether.

99
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:06,000
From Symposium, we will explore what is love as a predicate and how beauty interacts with

100
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:14,240
love, in the words spoken by Socrates, to behold true realities that nourish true virtue.

101
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,840
In Phaedrus, Plato presents two shocking notions to us.

102
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,240
First, that predicates are a hierarchy of excessive desire.

103
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:30,120
Second, the virtue of temperance is the acquired opinion to desire the best.

104
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:36,400
Contending with Nino, we will attempt to thread the concepts of beauty, excellence, knowledge,

105
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,240
and action into a woven hole.

106
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,040
From Pratilis, Revelations await us.

107
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:50,720
Plato suggests the very instruments of knowledge, names, is in fact images that are nothing

108
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,120
like the realities they purport to depict in a transparent reality.

109
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:01,360
If this is the case, the standard critique of image makers by Plato, and dialogues such

110
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:09,480
as the Republic, seem to extend even to words, let alone images of the poets.

111
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,800
How can we reconcile this apparent tension?

112
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,840
We read together to find out.

113
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:22,600
Lastly, we continue to circumscribe the path with permittities, one of the more enigmatic

114
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,020
dialogues of Plato.

115
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:32,120
After demolishing Socrates' notion of forms, images and likeness are explored to point

116
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,320
the way to a rehabilitated conception of the beautiful.

117
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,040
When I introduce philosophy to my design students, I begin with a topic of aritse, which can

118
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,800
be translated to excellence or virtue.

119
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:51,960
Most of my students have never heard of the concept in a design context.

120
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,240
This was the case of my own education.

121
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:00,760
This collapse of aesthetic deliberation into personal preference is my suggestion why excellence

122
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,040
is never spoken of in the classroom when you would seem to be the most obvious place to

123
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,520
talk about it.

124
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:11,520
Instead, what if we can reconsider virtue not as a cultural subject of preference, let

125
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:17,960
alone as a visual preference, but rather as a beautiful activity, then we can begin

126
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:25,160
to see with a vantage point of reality pregnant with possibility and energy is what I suggest.

127
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:33,480
As I tell my students, writing is like writing, both in prose and poetry, when done well

128
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:39,380
presents to the viewer a reality, albeit in different modes, which complement one another.

129
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:45,100
For example, when we ask the question, does this artifact do a function, that only really

130
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:51,420
entails a reality of engineering, whereas if we ask the question, does this artifact

131
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:57,620
function with beauty, we're now asking a very different question with very different answers.

132
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,340
The answer such an inquiry is vastly different.

133
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:07,180
It is not a formulaic repetition of the same answer no matter the context, but instead it's

134
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:12,180
when done well and with beauty a creative living dance.

135
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,940
My own experience as a design student is an example of this.

136
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:21,740
In my sophomore typography class, I was instructed by a typeface designer named Joshua Darden.

137
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:26,180
As I recall, almost 20 years later, what I thought at the end of that first class with

138
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:30,660
Darden, I went to mind as beautiful as his.

139
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:35,140
I immediately recognized in that first lecture Joshua's intellectual powers, perceptions

140
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:39,420
and considerations and fell in love with what I was beholding.

141
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:44,700
I was then Joshua's apprentice for three years after this inaugural course.

142
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:50,460
It is funny to think that in one lecture directed my entire understanding of what design could

143
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,740
be and how my life was to unfold.

144
00:11:53,740 --> 00:12:02,240
At 19 years old, my entire orientation to life was reshaped by an encounter of the beautiful.

145
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,100
My life was shaped by that beauty and that acted upon me and compelled me towards a beloved.

146
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:11,600
And this is important, it's not a beloved of the body of some physicality of some kind,

147
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,200
but rather a beauty of an activity of the soul.

148
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,560
This is one of the things we will explore together.

149
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,760
Plato is very empathetic about the point, demonstrates that beauty, there are many kinds

150
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,960
of beauty.

151
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,840
The beauty of living bodies, such as maidens and horses are beautiful.

152
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,120
There is the beauty of the activities of the soul, such as my mentor's thought process

153
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,080
and typography, but there is more still.

154
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:38,640
There is the beauty of virtue itself, such as 42 in charity, the beauty of laws and institutions

155
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:46,440
and even higher still, all of which seem to abide under some unity named the beautiful.

156
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,800
I would like you to consider if the beautiful we encounter in our lives is also not just

157
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,680
some generic conceptual abstraction.

158
00:12:54,680 --> 00:13:01,200
For example, it is not sunsets that are beautiful, it's this sunset you are beholding that is

159
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,600
beautiful.

160
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,560
Maidens are not beautiful as an abstraction, this maiden before you is beautiful, this

161
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:12,200
act of charity you witness is beautiful, this law enacted is beautiful.

162
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:19,560
In all these examples, beauty seems to direct us to the hexity, the thinness of an entity.

163
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:25,520
Yet also beauty seems to point us to something universal beyond the particular individual

164
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,600
present in front of us.

165
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,000
The many in the one is expressed in the beautiful.

166
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,920
I ask you to join me in these readings of the Six Platonic Dialogues to find out the consequences

167
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,320
of such a conception of the beautiful.

168
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,040
Our understanding of images and likeness also requires a more profound thought if we wish

169
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:51,240
to grasp what Plato means by beauty without figure or color.

170
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,080
We need another look at likeness.

171
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,960
Likeness as mimicry is the standard explanation of beauty in the arts.

172
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:05,760
The drawing of a person is beautiful when it best mimics the actual person before it as

173
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,760
a subject.

174
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:13,920
I suggest in this lecture series that mimicry of nature does not exhaust the beautiful.

175
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:20,520
As Carl Jung says, quoting the alchemists, what nature leaps in perfect are perfects.

176
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,760
Consider how does a name mimic the thing named?

177
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:30,680
In what manner is a written named dog, composed of sounds and marks on a page, anything like

178
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,120
an actual dog?

179
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,040
We have to admit there is no likeness in sound or figure.

180
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,040
Likeness as mimicry is lacking as an explanation.

181
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:44,680
Using my points, the convertibility of goodness and beauty is a puzzle we will attend to in

182
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,360
this seminar series.

183
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:51,320
One of the readings in one reading of these dialogues from Plato, you could conclude,

184
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,040
as Tolstoy did, that goodness and beauty are one in the same concept collapsed into the

185
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,740
notion of pleasure.

186
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,000
But such a conclusion does not exhaust all possible answers.

187
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,840
The phrase goodness is the same as beauty entails acknowledging some differences.

188
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:11,280
Now that difference could be one of phonemes or sounds that make up the name, so for example,

189
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:17,280
beauty and jamal in Arabic posit the same notion, but in different languages, depicted

190
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:22,360
by in other, in different markings that map on a different sounds.

191
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,520
Or that difference between goodness and beauty could be a difference in relation under a

192
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,520
subject.

193
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,840
For example, a good chair is different from the good man sitting on that chair.

194
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:37,000
For most ecmatically, the difference between goodness and beauty could be one of analogy.

195
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,900
To explain what I mean, let me give you an example.

196
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:46,280
What exactly are we saying when we speak of the term liquid capital or cash flow?

197
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:51,560
When we use the term liquid in these cases, we tend to think of entities such as water,

198
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:55,080
yet capital is nothing like water.

199
00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:00,120
Capital is a promise imposed onto some material, be it paper with ink or zeros and ones on electrical

200
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,120
current.

201
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:09,640
Water is a particular arrangement imposed onto hydrogen and oxygen atoms.

202
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:16,800
In both form and material, capital and water are nothing alike, yet the analogy of liquid

203
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,720
posits a real and common reality to both entities.

204
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:27,280
And I mean real reality, actual reality, not figures of speech because economists deploy

205
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,960
liquid dynamics, which describes water, to make falsifiable predictions related to finance

206
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,960
and capital.

207
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:40,080
Rather, whether the difference between goodness and beauty is one of sounds, relation to a

208
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:45,800
subject, or analogy, is something we will need to investigate together.

209
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:51,640
Much of our work together is to help uncover the deeper meanings of phrases and words that

210
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:56,280
have become collapsed or buried over the development of philosophy.

211
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,280
The term is such a word.

212
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:04,760
What is translated a form, figure, pattern, arrangement, is in fact referring to paradigma,

213
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,880
eidos, merfe, schemata, or taxes, for example.

214
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,600
These are not the same idea, but instead a hierarchy of reality.

215
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:19,120
Aerosol uses taxes and rhetoric to refer to the composition of unlike elements arranged

216
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,320
together to make a whole of a persuasive speech.

217
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:28,680
He also uses schemata to reference the shape of unnatural kinds bound together, whereas

218
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:34,160
the term morphae is used for natural types like animals and dogs and humans, for example.

219
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:40,360
Eidos, which may be translated as species, can, to aria be a sematic category, whereas

220
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:45,840
for the Greeks, eidos was ontological, rather than sematic.

221
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,280
Within Sufi philosophy, you could make a suggestion of this form of appearance to reality, could

222
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:57,120
map onto eidos and morphae distinctions, but that might more to the point of why disentangling

223
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,280
form is a worthwhile venture, for better understanding.

224
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:07,800
Lastly, paradigma points to what later thinkers such as Aquinas would call the exemplar cause

225
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:14,160
of a thing, the isolated entity which illustrates the first principle within the mind of the

226
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,960
maker.

227
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:22,720
Where Aquinas states the exemplars are in the mind, Plato saw paradigma as a much more

228
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,880
authentic and singular reality outside of minds.

229
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,360
A more rigorous understanding of these terms will likewise aid our understanding of the

230
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,440
beautiful for Plato.

231
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:39,560
The dichotomy between a recitalian and platonic thought is due for reconsideration.

232
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:44,960
Rather than the top-down rationality count of Plato, it is my hope as we review these

233
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:51,280
dialogues together, that the variable-making arts at a particular time play a large role

234
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,280
in Plato's arguments.

235
00:18:53,280 --> 00:19:02,160
This is different from the singular mind-hunting of definitions of concepts with ignorant interlaculars

236
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,680
for some inert substance such as what is piety or what is courage.

237
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:11,360
Indeed, seeing Plato arrange the dialogues in such a manner so as to esteem the making

238
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,760
activities that bootstrap knowledge is a very different experience of dialectic.

239
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:22,440
Much more inductive than the top-down rationalist depictions of Plato would permit.

240
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:28,560
If Plato truly is a top-down thinker, then why does Plato's character Socrates repeatedly

241
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:34,680
recite the work of doctors, craftsmen, and gymnasts to refute the claims of his speaking

242
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,360
partners?

243
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,200
Something is going on counter to the stereotype.

244
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:46,080
To summarize the section so far, our inquiry into the beautiful will instruct us in four

245
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,080
major topics.

246
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:52,920
First, the motivation of pupils under the topic of desire, second, pedagogy under the

247
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:58,880
topic of rhetoric, followed by epistemology under the topic of love, lastly, the nature

248
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,680
of reality is to be studied under the topic of images and resemblances.

249
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,280
This course is for several kinds of readers.

250
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:15,040
First, this course is for those who come from an artistic practice and wish to explore philosophy.

251
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:21,240
By reconsidering what is beauty, artists may deepen their practice with such an investigation.

252
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:26,040
Philosophy can be daunting, especially if you attempt to re-contemporary thinkers.

253
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:29,720
The terms are technical and are different from common meanings that you would find in

254
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:34,600
the dictionary and are very loaded with a long tradition.

255
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:40,400
But by starting with Plato under the beautiful virtue, you will have a gateway to connect

256
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,520
and enliven your professional practice with the methods and language of philosophy.

257
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,320
The second kind of learner in this course is for those who wish to have a more steady

258
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,960
footing for the authentic life.

259
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,760
As I spoke with Johannes in a discussion you can find on YouTube, we cannot simply copy

260
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:03,360
paste the ways of thinking of the past and bring it to today.

261
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,760
Our world is different from the past.

262
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,520
Our constraints, our dangers and our opportunities are not alike to that time.

263
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:16,120
Instead, we need to reach not for the duplication or mimicry of the past, but rather bring

264
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:20,760
forth a new image of how to live well.

265
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:27,920
The beautiful is how I believe we can begin to achieve this authentic life of a true happiness.

266
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:32,760
If you are such a learner, join me in the Halkion Guild to meditate on the following

267
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,520
questions.

268
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,400
What is the beautiful?

269
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,520
Who understands and enacts beauty?

270
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,720
What does beauty shape in the soul?

271
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,000
How do we come to know and love beauty in the world?

272
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,720
And lastly, where does a love for virtue come from?

273
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:56,120
I look forward to our approach towards the mysteries that surround both the beautiful

274
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,120
and virtue.

275
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:02,000
I am confident you will be delighted by what springs forth inside yourself by the sincere

276
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,080
inquiry into the beautiful.

277
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:10,720
We will begin our inquiry with the dialogue greater hippiest, where our common suggestions

278
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,040
of what is beauty is to be reconsidered.

279
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,760
I'll see you all then.
