00:00.000 --> 00:09.680
So, welcome to this introduction recording of our lecture series, The Beautiful and Virtue.

00:09.680 --> 00:12.640
A study in Six Platonic Dialogues.

00:12.640 --> 00:16.840
Now before I begin with these prepared, my prepared introduction essay, I want to first

00:16.840 --> 00:24.080
say thank you for taking the time to sign up for the course and spend the next several

00:24.080 --> 00:32.120
weeks with me in investigating Plato's early dialogues on the topics of the beautiful,

00:32.120 --> 00:34.840
in particular, and the virtue.

00:34.840 --> 00:37.120
There's a lot of things you could be doing with your time.

00:37.120 --> 00:41.400
You could be spending your time hiking or leisure activities like watching movies or

00:41.400 --> 00:47.560
spending time with loved ones, but instead you chose to take the time to go through

00:47.560 --> 00:52.960
these lecture series and the discussions of dialogue with Plato.

00:52.960 --> 00:57.480
And I think that's something to be commended.

00:57.480 --> 01:01.400
I think it's very common to think that there's something very given.

01:01.400 --> 01:06.280
We take it for granted what beauty is, but I think the reason why maybe you are in this

01:06.280 --> 01:12.160
course right now and felt a calling, a resonance, to be here is that it's the simple things

01:12.160 --> 01:19.200
in life that might be so given, so obvious, so explicit that with more investigation,

01:19.200 --> 01:24.720
more inquiry, you realize there's a lot more subtlety and complexity going on.

01:24.720 --> 01:29.960
And that's something that's worth your time, to have a life that's worth the kind of enrichment

01:29.960 --> 01:33.360
that a deeper consideration will allow.

01:33.360 --> 01:37.520
I want to thank you for that consideration and be given this opportunity to speak with

01:37.520 --> 01:38.440
you today.

01:38.440 --> 01:44.200
So with that said, hopefully this dialogue series and lecture about it will be worth

01:44.200 --> 01:48.120
that investment of time, and I take that seriously, so I want to thank you for that.

01:48.120 --> 01:50.720
So let's begin.

01:50.720 --> 02:00.280
One morning not too long ago, I felt the urge to re-retonance Aquinas' take on honesty.

02:00.280 --> 02:03.520
In particular, I read this, I was reading this account on an ostinium and was shocked

02:03.520 --> 02:06.440
to what I found.

02:06.440 --> 02:12.000
Now when I recall honesty, as taught by my parents, or to use the term with friends,

02:12.000 --> 02:17.880
the term seems synonymous with truth telling, yet Aquinas had a completely different understanding

02:18.640 --> 02:22.960
of ostinium, described in four parts in the Summa.

02:22.960 --> 02:28.240
First, honesty is placed under the virtue of temperance.

02:28.240 --> 02:34.360
This is unusual because temperance is a moral virtue and not intellectual virtue, which

02:34.360 --> 02:38.960
we would think is related to honesty, with truth telling.

02:38.960 --> 02:43.920
Second, honesty is convertible with virtue itself.

02:43.920 --> 02:48.240
Now truth telling is important, I wouldn't dismiss that.

02:48.240 --> 02:55.360
But it would not seem to encompass the entirety of what virtue would mean as a concept.

02:55.360 --> 03:00.600
Aquinas is directing the reader to something radically different from just truth telling

03:00.600 --> 03:02.560
with the term ostinium.

03:02.560 --> 03:09.520
Third, honesty is not the same as the useful or the pleasant.

03:09.520 --> 03:14.280
But rather something good for its own sake, a statement that's usually only reserved

03:14.280 --> 03:18.520
for virtue where it said human happiness.

03:18.520 --> 03:25.640
Lastly, honesty is said to be convertible with beauty.

03:25.640 --> 03:31.680
And not a beauty of physical appearance, Aquinas is very clear to emphasize rather the spiritual

03:31.680 --> 03:34.400
beauty of true reality.

03:34.400 --> 03:39.480
It's a state of beauty of clarity and perfected existence.

03:39.480 --> 03:45.480
All at once as I'm reading Aquinas' account on ostinium, I understood the power of Plato's

03:45.480 --> 03:46.800
work.

03:46.800 --> 03:51.920
Centuries later, the long shadow of Plato's writing on the beautiful has been cast on

03:51.920 --> 03:55.680
this 12th century Dominican writing.

03:55.680 --> 03:58.440
And that long shadow does not stop at Aquinas.

03:58.440 --> 04:04.040
When I recall the Heidegger's account on authentic existence as care, I continue to

04:04.040 --> 04:11.760
sense Plato's shadow continued to stretch over time well into the 20th century.

04:11.760 --> 04:17.640
Now this lecture series is going to consider how, for Plato, beauty ascends the beloved

04:17.640 --> 04:21.320
from appearances to true realities.

04:21.320 --> 04:26.280
This is a shocking assertion because since Kant's beauty has been treated as a personal

04:26.280 --> 04:31.000
preference on the same level as a favorite ice cream flavor.

04:31.000 --> 04:36.840
How could a subjective preference move a pupil from appearances to true reality?

04:36.840 --> 04:44.600
This is a question of pedagogy, of epistemology, and just kind of reason discourse.

04:44.600 --> 04:48.920
When would a preference ever change a person's entire orientation to reality?

04:48.920 --> 04:57.480
So now we have a question of ethics and how to live the good life.

04:57.480 --> 05:04.040
Consider how if we considered beauty as this vehicle, as the level of a preference for

05:04.040 --> 05:07.160
ice cream flavor, how could that possibly be the case?

05:07.160 --> 05:09.000
I would not think so.

05:09.000 --> 05:15.040
Instead, in this course, we return to the foundation of thought in Plato and see what

05:15.040 --> 05:19.200
other mode of beauty we could consider.

05:19.200 --> 05:25.240
Now join me in this six module seminar as a journey within the platonic dialogues that

05:25.240 --> 05:28.920
approach the beautiful and virtue.

05:28.920 --> 05:36.080
If this is the first time you're encountering me, I hold a BFA in communication design from

05:36.080 --> 05:39.000
Parsons School of Design.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.840
Since 2015, I have worked with corporations such as Starbucks, Foot Locker, Express, and

05:43.840 --> 05:47.120
Google on various design projects.

05:47.120 --> 05:57.440
I have taught either as a lecturer or as a professor in various educational centers

05:57.440 --> 06:02.840
on design, such in New York City, such as School of Visual Arts, Pratt Institute, Parsons

06:02.840 --> 06:06.960
School of Design, the Fashion Institute of Technology, and the City University of New

06:06.960 --> 06:07.960
York.

06:07.960 --> 06:14.880
In 2021, I co-authored with Javier Rivera and OG Rose the book, A Philosophy of Glimpses,

06:14.880 --> 06:17.240
available on Amazon.

06:17.240 --> 06:22.280
I am thankful for this opportunity with the Halkion Guild that has provided to me to speak

06:22.280 --> 06:24.800
with you today.

06:24.800 --> 06:29.640
My time with design students focuses on drawing forth the beauty inside their sketches and

06:29.640 --> 06:30.880
prototypes.

06:30.880 --> 06:36.760
With my students, we worked out with the first principles of art and design, the hidden fulfillment

06:36.760 --> 06:40.000
of what is possible inside their work.

06:40.000 --> 06:46.320
Now while such practical practices are very rewarding, because the first principles, in

06:46.320 --> 06:52.040
this case for design beauty, is taken for granted, I have always felt like the opportunity

06:52.040 --> 06:57.120
to really investigate and discuss beauty was always lacking in these institutions, which

06:57.120 --> 06:59.080
is ironic.

06:59.080 --> 07:04.480
A different context of inquiry is required to think about these first principles.

07:04.480 --> 07:11.120
Now with the Halkion Guild, we will explore the in Six Platonic Dialogues with the particular

07:11.120 --> 07:14.760
contemplation of the beautiful and virtue.

07:14.760 --> 07:21.600
The six dialogues we will read together are, Greater Hippias, Symposium, Phaedrus, Nino,

07:21.600 --> 07:24.800
Pratilis, and Permanides.

07:24.800 --> 07:30.280
I have structured the course in such a manner so that as we read these dialogues, we will

07:30.280 --> 07:33.720
circumscribe the following considerations.

07:33.720 --> 07:39.800
We start with Greater Hippias, with the typical Alencus method of knocking down the Sophists

07:39.800 --> 07:45.640
Hippias's particular examples of the beautiful, followed by Socrates' hypothetical replies

07:45.640 --> 07:50.840
to what the definition of the beautiful would be, albeit with failure.

07:50.840 --> 07:56.120
In fact, from the exchanges between Hippias and Socrates, the connection between predicates

07:56.120 --> 07:59.240
and their subjects begin to untether.

07:59.240 --> 08:06.000
From Symposium, we will explore what is love as a predicate and how beauty interacts with

08:06.000 --> 08:14.240
love, in the words spoken by Socrates, to behold true realities that nourish true virtue.

08:14.240 --> 08:18.840
In Phaedrus, Plato presents two shocking notions to us.

08:18.840 --> 08:23.240
First, that predicates are a hierarchy of excessive desire.

08:23.240 --> 08:30.120
Second, the virtue of temperance is the acquired opinion to desire the best.

08:30.120 --> 08:36.400
Contending with Nino, we will attempt to thread the concepts of beauty, excellence, knowledge,

08:36.400 --> 08:39.240
and action into a woven hole.

08:39.240 --> 08:44.040
From Pratilis, Revelations await us.

08:44.040 --> 08:50.720
Plato suggests the very instruments of knowledge, names, is in fact images that are nothing

08:50.720 --> 08:56.120
like the realities they purport to depict in a transparent reality.

08:56.120 --> 09:01.360
If this is the case, the standard critique of image makers by Plato, and dialogues such

09:01.360 --> 09:09.480
as the Republic, seem to extend even to words, let alone images of the poets.

09:09.480 --> 09:12.800
How can we reconcile this apparent tension?

09:12.800 --> 09:15.840
We read together to find out.

09:15.840 --> 09:22.600
Lastly, we continue to circumscribe the path with permittities, one of the more enigmatic

09:22.600 --> 09:25.020
dialogues of Plato.

09:25.020 --> 09:32.120
After demolishing Socrates' notion of forms, images and likeness are explored to point

09:32.120 --> 09:37.320
the way to a rehabilitated conception of the beautiful.

09:37.320 --> 09:42.040
When I introduce philosophy to my design students, I begin with a topic of aritse, which can

09:42.040 --> 09:45.800
be translated to excellence or virtue.

09:45.960 --> 09:51.960
Most of my students have never heard of the concept in a design context.

09:51.960 --> 09:54.240
This was the case of my own education.

09:54.240 --> 10:00.760
This collapse of aesthetic deliberation into personal preference is my suggestion why excellence

10:00.760 --> 10:04.040
is never spoken of in the classroom when you would seem to be the most obvious place to

10:04.040 --> 10:05.520
talk about it.

10:05.520 --> 10:11.520
Instead, what if we can reconsider virtue not as a cultural subject of preference, let

10:11.520 --> 10:17.960
alone as a visual preference, but rather as a beautiful activity, then we can begin

10:17.960 --> 10:25.160
to see with a vantage point of reality pregnant with possibility and energy is what I suggest.

10:25.160 --> 10:33.480
As I tell my students, writing is like writing, both in prose and poetry, when done well

10:33.480 --> 10:39.380
presents to the viewer a reality, albeit in different modes, which complement one another.

10:39.380 --> 10:45.100
For example, when we ask the question, does this artifact do a function, that only really

10:45.100 --> 10:51.420
entails a reality of engineering, whereas if we ask the question, does this artifact

10:51.420 --> 10:57.620
function with beauty, we're now asking a very different question with very different answers.

10:57.620 --> 11:00.340
The answer such an inquiry is vastly different.

11:00.340 --> 11:07.180
It is not a formulaic repetition of the same answer no matter the context, but instead it's

11:07.300 --> 11:12.180
when done well and with beauty a creative living dance.

11:12.180 --> 11:15.940
My own experience as a design student is an example of this.

11:15.940 --> 11:21.740
In my sophomore typography class, I was instructed by a typeface designer named Joshua Darden.

11:21.740 --> 11:26.180
As I recall, almost 20 years later, what I thought at the end of that first class with

11:26.180 --> 11:30.660
Darden, I went to mind as beautiful as his.

11:30.660 --> 11:35.140
I immediately recognized in that first lecture Joshua's intellectual powers, perceptions

11:35.140 --> 11:39.420
and considerations and fell in love with what I was beholding.

11:39.420 --> 11:44.700
I was then Joshua's apprentice for three years after this inaugural course.

11:44.700 --> 11:50.460
It is funny to think that in one lecture directed my entire understanding of what design could

11:50.460 --> 11:53.740
be and how my life was to unfold.

11:53.740 --> 12:02.240
At 19 years old, my entire orientation to life was reshaped by an encounter of the beautiful.

12:02.240 --> 12:07.100
My life was shaped by that beauty and that acted upon me and compelled me towards a beloved.

12:07.100 --> 12:11.600
And this is important, it's not a beloved of the body of some physicality of some kind,

12:11.600 --> 12:15.200
but rather a beauty of an activity of the soul.

12:15.200 --> 12:17.560
This is one of the things we will explore together.

12:17.560 --> 12:21.760
Plato is very empathetic about the point, demonstrates that beauty, there are many kinds

12:21.760 --> 12:22.960
of beauty.

12:22.960 --> 12:26.840
The beauty of living bodies, such as maidens and horses are beautiful.

12:26.840 --> 12:30.120
There is the beauty of the activities of the soul, such as my mentor's thought process

12:30.120 --> 12:34.080
and typography, but there is more still.

12:34.080 --> 12:38.640
There is the beauty of virtue itself, such as 42 in charity, the beauty of laws and institutions

12:38.640 --> 12:46.440
and even higher still, all of which seem to abide under some unity named the beautiful.

12:46.440 --> 12:50.800
I would like you to consider if the beautiful we encounter in our lives is also not just

12:50.800 --> 12:54.680
some generic conceptual abstraction.

12:54.680 --> 13:01.200
For example, it is not sunsets that are beautiful, it's this sunset you are beholding that is

13:01.200 --> 13:02.600
beautiful.

13:02.600 --> 13:07.560
Maidens are not beautiful as an abstraction, this maiden before you is beautiful, this

13:07.560 --> 13:12.200
act of charity you witness is beautiful, this law enacted is beautiful.

13:12.200 --> 13:19.560
In all these examples, beauty seems to direct us to the hexity, the thinness of an entity.

13:19.560 --> 13:25.520
Yet also beauty seems to point us to something universal beyond the particular individual

13:25.520 --> 13:27.600
present in front of us.

13:27.600 --> 13:32.000
The many in the one is expressed in the beautiful.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.920
I ask you to join me in these readings of the Six Platonic Dialogues to find out the consequences

13:36.920 --> 13:40.320
of such a conception of the beautiful.

13:40.320 --> 13:45.040
Our understanding of images and likeness also requires a more profound thought if we wish

13:45.040 --> 13:51.240
to grasp what Plato means by beauty without figure or color.

13:51.240 --> 13:54.080
We need another look at likeness.

13:54.080 --> 13:58.960
Likeness as mimicry is the standard explanation of beauty in the arts.

13:58.960 --> 14:05.760
The drawing of a person is beautiful when it best mimics the actual person before it as

14:05.760 --> 14:06.760
a subject.

14:06.760 --> 14:13.920
I suggest in this lecture series that mimicry of nature does not exhaust the beautiful.

14:13.920 --> 14:20.520
As Carl Jung says, quoting the alchemists, what nature leaps in perfect are perfects.

14:20.520 --> 14:23.760
Consider how does a name mimic the thing named?

14:23.760 --> 14:30.680
In what manner is a written named dog, composed of sounds and marks on a page, anything like

14:30.680 --> 14:32.120
an actual dog?

14:32.120 --> 14:36.040
We have to admit there is no likeness in sound or figure.

14:36.040 --> 14:40.040
Likeness as mimicry is lacking as an explanation.

14:40.040 --> 14:44.680
Using my points, the convertibility of goodness and beauty is a puzzle we will attend to in

14:44.680 --> 14:46.360
this seminar series.

14:46.360 --> 14:51.320
One of the readings in one reading of these dialogues from Plato, you could conclude,

14:51.320 --> 14:56.040
as Tolstoy did, that goodness and beauty are one in the same concept collapsed into the

14:56.040 --> 14:57.740
notion of pleasure.

14:57.740 --> 15:01.000
But such a conclusion does not exhaust all possible answers.

15:01.000 --> 15:06.840
The phrase goodness is the same as beauty entails acknowledging some differences.

15:06.840 --> 15:11.280
Now that difference could be one of phonemes or sounds that make up the name, so for example,

15:11.280 --> 15:17.280
beauty and jamal in Arabic posit the same notion, but in different languages, depicted

15:17.280 --> 15:22.360
by in other, in different markings that map on a different sounds.

15:22.360 --> 15:26.520
Or that difference between goodness and beauty could be a difference in relation under a

15:26.520 --> 15:27.520
subject.

15:27.520 --> 15:31.840
For example, a good chair is different from the good man sitting on that chair.

15:31.840 --> 15:37.000
For most ecmatically, the difference between goodness and beauty could be one of analogy.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.900
To explain what I mean, let me give you an example.

15:39.900 --> 15:46.280
What exactly are we saying when we speak of the term liquid capital or cash flow?

15:46.280 --> 15:51.560
When we use the term liquid in these cases, we tend to think of entities such as water,

15:51.560 --> 15:55.080
yet capital is nothing like water.

15:55.080 --> 16:00.120
Capital is a promise imposed onto some material, be it paper with ink or zeros and ones on electrical

16:00.120 --> 16:01.120
current.

16:01.400 --> 16:09.640
Water is a particular arrangement imposed onto hydrogen and oxygen atoms.

16:09.640 --> 16:16.800
In both form and material, capital and water are nothing alike, yet the analogy of liquid

16:16.800 --> 16:21.720
posits a real and common reality to both entities.

16:21.720 --> 16:27.280
And I mean real reality, actual reality, not figures of speech because economists deploy

16:27.440 --> 16:32.960
liquid dynamics, which describes water, to make falsifiable predictions related to finance

16:32.960 --> 16:33.960
and capital.

16:33.960 --> 16:40.080
Rather, whether the difference between goodness and beauty is one of sounds, relation to a

16:40.080 --> 16:45.800
subject, or analogy, is something we will need to investigate together.

16:45.800 --> 16:51.640
Much of our work together is to help uncover the deeper meanings of phrases and words that

16:51.640 --> 16:56.280
have become collapsed or buried over the development of philosophy.

16:56.280 --> 16:58.280
The term is such a word.

16:58.280 --> 17:04.760
What is translated a form, figure, pattern, arrangement, is in fact referring to paradigma,

17:04.760 --> 17:08.880
eidos, merfe, schemata, or taxes, for example.

17:08.880 --> 17:14.600
These are not the same idea, but instead a hierarchy of reality.

17:14.600 --> 17:19.120
Aerosol uses taxes and rhetoric to refer to the composition of unlike elements arranged

17:19.120 --> 17:23.320
together to make a whole of a persuasive speech.

17:23.320 --> 17:28.680
He also uses schemata to reference the shape of unnatural kinds bound together, whereas

17:28.680 --> 17:34.160
the term morphae is used for natural types like animals and dogs and humans, for example.

17:34.160 --> 17:40.360
Eidos, which may be translated as species, can, to aria be a sematic category, whereas

17:40.360 --> 17:45.840
for the Greeks, eidos was ontological, rather than sematic.

17:45.840 --> 17:50.280
Within Sufi philosophy, you could make a suggestion of this form of appearance to reality, could

17:50.280 --> 17:57.120
map onto eidos and morphae distinctions, but that might more to the point of why disentangling

17:57.120 --> 18:01.280
form is a worthwhile venture, for better understanding.

18:01.280 --> 18:07.800
Lastly, paradigma points to what later thinkers such as Aquinas would call the exemplar cause

18:07.800 --> 18:14.160
of a thing, the isolated entity which illustrates the first principle within the mind of the

18:14.160 --> 18:15.960
maker.

18:15.960 --> 18:22.720
Where Aquinas states the exemplars are in the mind, Plato saw paradigma as a much more

18:22.720 --> 18:26.880
authentic and singular reality outside of minds.

18:26.880 --> 18:31.360
A more rigorous understanding of these terms will likewise aid our understanding of the

18:31.360 --> 18:34.440
beautiful for Plato.

18:34.440 --> 18:39.560
The dichotomy between a recitalian and platonic thought is due for reconsideration.

18:39.560 --> 18:44.960
Rather than the top-down rationality count of Plato, it is my hope as we review these

18:44.960 --> 18:51.280
dialogues together, that the variable-making arts at a particular time play a large role

18:51.280 --> 18:53.280
in Plato's arguments.

18:53.280 --> 19:02.160
This is different from the singular mind-hunting of definitions of concepts with ignorant interlaculars

19:02.160 --> 19:06.680
for some inert substance such as what is piety or what is courage.

19:06.680 --> 19:11.360
Indeed, seeing Plato arrange the dialogues in such a manner so as to esteem the making

19:11.360 --> 19:16.760
activities that bootstrap knowledge is a very different experience of dialectic.

19:16.760 --> 19:22.440
Much more inductive than the top-down rationalist depictions of Plato would permit.

19:22.440 --> 19:28.560
If Plato truly is a top-down thinker, then why does Plato's character Socrates repeatedly

19:28.560 --> 19:34.680
recite the work of doctors, craftsmen, and gymnasts to refute the claims of his speaking

19:34.680 --> 19:36.360
partners?

19:36.360 --> 19:40.200
Something is going on counter to the stereotype.

19:40.200 --> 19:46.080
To summarize the section so far, our inquiry into the beautiful will instruct us in four

19:46.080 --> 19:47.080
major topics.

19:47.080 --> 19:52.920
First, the motivation of pupils under the topic of desire, second, pedagogy under the

19:52.920 --> 19:58.880
topic of rhetoric, followed by epistemology under the topic of love, lastly, the nature

19:58.880 --> 20:04.680
of reality is to be studied under the topic of images and resemblances.

20:04.680 --> 20:08.280
This course is for several kinds of readers.

20:08.360 --> 20:15.040
First, this course is for those who come from an artistic practice and wish to explore philosophy.

20:15.040 --> 20:21.240
By reconsidering what is beauty, artists may deepen their practice with such an investigation.

20:21.240 --> 20:26.040
Philosophy can be daunting, especially if you attempt to re-contemporary thinkers.

20:26.040 --> 20:29.720
The terms are technical and are different from common meanings that you would find in

20:29.720 --> 20:34.600
the dictionary and are very loaded with a long tradition.

20:34.600 --> 20:40.400
But by starting with Plato under the beautiful virtue, you will have a gateway to connect

20:40.400 --> 20:45.520
and enliven your professional practice with the methods and language of philosophy.

20:45.520 --> 20:49.320
The second kind of learner in this course is for those who wish to have a more steady

20:49.320 --> 20:51.960
footing for the authentic life.

20:51.960 --> 20:56.760
As I spoke with Johannes in a discussion you can find on YouTube, we cannot simply copy

20:56.760 --> 21:03.360
paste the ways of thinking of the past and bring it to today.

21:03.360 --> 21:05.760
Our world is different from the past.

21:05.760 --> 21:10.520
Our constraints, our dangers and our opportunities are not alike to that time.

21:10.520 --> 21:16.120
Instead, we need to reach not for the duplication or mimicry of the past, but rather bring

21:16.120 --> 21:20.760
forth a new image of how to live well.

21:20.760 --> 21:27.920
The beautiful is how I believe we can begin to achieve this authentic life of a true happiness.

21:27.920 --> 21:32.760
If you are such a learner, join me in the Halkion Guild to meditate on the following

21:32.760 --> 21:34.520
questions.

21:34.520 --> 21:36.400
What is the beautiful?

21:36.400 --> 21:39.520
Who understands and enacts beauty?

21:39.520 --> 21:43.720
What does beauty shape in the soul?

21:43.720 --> 21:47.000
How do we come to know and love beauty in the world?

21:47.000 --> 21:51.720
And lastly, where does a love for virtue come from?

21:51.720 --> 21:56.120
I look forward to our approach towards the mysteries that surround both the beautiful

21:56.120 --> 21:57.120
and virtue.

21:57.320 --> 22:02.000
I am confident you will be delighted by what springs forth inside yourself by the sincere

22:02.000 --> 22:05.080
inquiry into the beautiful.

22:05.080 --> 22:10.720
We will begin our inquiry with the dialogue greater hippiest, where our common suggestions

22:10.720 --> 22:13.040
of what is beauty is to be reconsidered.

22:13.040 --> 22:13.760
I'll see you all then.
