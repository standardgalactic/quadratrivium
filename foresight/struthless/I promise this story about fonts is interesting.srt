1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
Some of them are formal, others playful, some are scary, ironic, important, timeless,

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,600
trans, weird, wonderful, and some of them should not be used as subtitles for Avatar.

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,440
This is the story of Fox, but it's also the story of civilization, creativity, innovation, power,

4
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,160
obsession, war, love, and human connection. Okay, I can hear it in my voice,

5
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,640
and if right now you're thinking, dude, that sounds like way too much to derive from

6
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,560
Jokerman, don't worry. Because before I made this doco, that's what I thought too. Also,

7
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,880
just want to say a big thanks to Shopify for sponsoring this video, more on them later though.

8
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:54,000
For now, let's get weird. So this video started because I asked myself a pretty simple question.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,640
I was looking at the fonts on my computer and I just thought, where do all of these fonts come from?

10
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,760
I thought the answer would be simple. I thought it was just people designing stuff for word

11
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,720
processors. I pulled that thread and it was long before computers, so I was thinking, yeah,

12
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,440
maybe it starts at the printing press. But then I was like, well, how do we have all those

13
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,280
symbols? How do we know what to put in the printing press? So then I pulled that thread,

14
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,280
then I pulled another thread, then I pulled another thread, and you know what, let's just say we

15
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:28,720
have to go back. Like, way back. Our story starts 10,000 years ago in ancient Mesopotamia.

16
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,160
Yep, we're starting at the start. Basically, imagine you're a guy, you've got some goats,

17
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,160
they've got some chickens, but really what you want is oil. Because you can't make a

18
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,000
trade immediately, you need something that represents chicken, goats, wheat, oil, all of

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,600
the stuff that you would be trading. And so the ancient Mesopotamians made something called

20
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,320
clay boulay, basically big clay symbols that would represent various things. They had them

21
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,960
in about 16 categories. So imagine you've got a goat stone or a grain stone or an oil stone.

22
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,960
Now, the reason that this is important to our story is because of the mechanic that is going on

23
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,160
here. Things are being represented by the image of things. Instead of chickens, you have a clay

24
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:09,040
rock that says chickens. And this idea of representing things with symbols would go on to form the basis

25
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:16,160
of cuneiform. This is an actual fish. This is a pictogram of a fish. This is that pictogram

26
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,200
sideways. Here's it abstracted. And this right here is cuneiform for fish. Graphic symbols

27
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,040
depicting things. Cuneiform is some of the earliest forms we have of a formal written

28
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,560
language. In terms of font properties, one thing that we can note here is that cuneiform was often

29
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,400
read left to right. And the leading thesis is that more people were right-handed, so they wouldn't

30
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,720
smudge the clay that they were carving in as they wrote. It's kind of cool. But what is also very

31
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,680
cool is that cuneiform would eventually become one of the most famous ancient alphabets, the hieroglyphics

32
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,200
of ancient Egypt. So at this point in the video, you might be thinking, cool, man, but what does

33
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,560
this all have to do with the fonts of my computer? Well, let me get there. So time ticks on, various

34
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,240
civilizations rise and fall, and we get all of these cool little examples of alphabets popping up

35
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,480
in various forms of writing coming across the globe. But our next stop in this history tour

36
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,720
comes in ancient Greece. What the Phoenicians did is they took a good look at the hieroglyphics.

37
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,080
Now, like, yeah, love that. But what if we made the symbols even more abstract? And what if we

38
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,760
atomized their value so that they could form larger words as opposed to just being symbols?

39
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:19,760
These 22 letters, these symbols carved into stone are called Greek lapidary letters. It's an amazing

40
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,760
innovation because you could write so many things. And these stone carvings right here are among the

41
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,080
first formal use of Western letter forms. Now, there were a couple of problems with this early

42
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,400
alphabet from the Greeks. They only had uppercase. And while it was written in rows, the way that

43
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,840
you would read it would change. Sometimes you'd read left to right, other times right to left.

44
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,640
This is a format known as Bustrefidon, or as the Greeks called it, as the ox plows.

45
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,400
One second this way, one second that way. You just wait till they hear about palindromes.

46
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,480
Do nine men interpret nine men I nod? Oh, sure. But yeah, basically, there's a couple of kinks

47
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:56,800
to be ironed out. Enter the Romans. Yeah. Welcome to Rome. Ancient Rome took those Greek lapidary

48
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,400
letters and they turned them into their own alphabet, the Roman alphabet, the Latin alphabet,

49
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,440
the one that we still kind of use today. Now, at this point in the story, I've mostly been

50
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,440
talking about alphabets, but the Romans also did something in terms of font. When they had

51
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,840
their characters written out, they gave them little hats and little feet. These hats and feet

52
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:22,800
are what we call serifs. More on that later. For now, let's talk about mass production.

53
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,360
Like with so many inventions, as the old phrase goes, there's always something pretty cool going

54
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,840
on in dynastic China. What you're looking at right here is a movable type system. It was invented

55
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,800
in the 11th century in the Song Dynasty in China by Vixiang. It was a typing machine that was made

56
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,880
from ceramics that allowed the user to reprint words onto clay. It saved them time and meant that

57
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,480
you can mass produce messaging. Over the next four centuries, there were certain innovations

58
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:51,600
made to this, mostly using materials. The earliest metal ones that we've seen are from Korea in 1230,

59
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,160
but the machine that really got things going, as you guessed it, was the printing press. The year

60
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,440
is 1440, and a goldsmith named Johannes Gutenberg invents this contraption right here. This printing

61
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,880
press was a machine that could mass produce lettering. The way it worked was you'd have these

62
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,320
letters that you'd put into a machine, and they would almost act like a stamp on the paper,

63
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,800
and then that paper could go off and form books. But books were around before 1440, I hear you say,

64
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,520
yeah, that is true. But those books just weren't printed. They were actually written by hand.

65
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,840
Imagine writing a Bible by hand. In fact, this is a task that was done by monks, and when they did

66
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,360
write those Bibles by hand, they would use a calligraphy style, which we now know is black

67
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,080
letter. And because that was Gutenberg's reference for books, his printing press's first ever font

68
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,320
was a black letter font. A grandchild of this might be like the old English font, you know,

69
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,560
the one that people get like their birth years tattoo on them with, that. In any case, what you

70
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,360
are looking at right here is the first ever printed book, the Gutenberg Bible, with the first ever

71
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:50,080
printed Roman typeface, black letter. So I've got the printing press going on, and it has its one

72
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,880
typeface. But 30 years later, we get a new innovation. A fella called Nicholas Jensen comes

73
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,880
along and he's like, man, I don't reckon that black letter stuff. I just don't think it's that

74
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,360
legible. What if we changed it? He was inspired by some of the cleaner letters, the serif letters

75
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,480
from the ancient Romans. And so he created what he called a Roman typeface. This less cluttered,

76
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,040
more legible style was naturally an immediate hit. In fact, it's still kind of a hit today.

77
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,880
Open up a random book in your bookshelf, and you'll probably see a Roman type font. Now,

78
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,120
as you can imagine, once this new font drops, all of these other designers and innovators,

79
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,400
they also want to put their mark on history. They want to contribute. And what we start to see

80
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,840
is a rise in foundries all over Europe, places whose job it was to make typefaces. The humanist

81
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,040
spirit that was driving the Italian Renaissance also came with its own style of writing. Cursiva

82
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:40,720
humanistica, the thing that paved the way for italics. So meanwhile, right in mid century 16th

83
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,840
France, there's this other fella, this designer called Claude Garamond, who kept writing like this.

84
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,960
This elegant style was so revolutionary that we still actually use his font to this day. Garamond.

85
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,560
Great work, Claude. So over the next few centuries, we see designers like Fleischmann,

86
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,520
Baskerville, Badoni, but all of these designers had one thing in common. While their fonts were

87
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,280
amazing and brilliant, they were still riffing on a familiar theme. Seraphs. It's a variation on

88
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,720
the same font that the Romans were using, almost two millennia prior. But what about something simpler?

89
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,760
Sands without Seraph. Seraph. They didn't have Seraphs. Also known as grotesque. Now,

90
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,800
Sands Seraph was actually used, but it didn't enter the printing game until 1816. And this is

91
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,080
partially just because people didn't see it as formal enough to warrant its own typeface in a

92
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,280
printing press. Until this guy enters, William Kelsen IV. What up? What you're looking at here

93
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,960
is Kelsen Egyptian, the first known Sands Seraph typeface. Pretty cool. I actually really like it.

94
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,480
So 12 years later, right? This other dude, Vincent Figgins, he makes the second ever

95
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:45,520
Sands Seraph typeface. And as you can see, they are completely different. The first obvious difference

96
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,160
is the line weight. The Figgins font is huge, which means, oh yeah, it commands attention.

97
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,000
So in the 1800s, we're starting to see the rise of advertisements and posters. And for these people

98
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,520
making this type of communication, this Sands Seraph font was a godsend. It commanded attention,

99
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,400
it dictated page hierarchy, and of course, it was legible at a decent distance. So all of these

100
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,720
practical uses, plus the fact that the aesthetic just said new, it made Sands Seraph get pretty

101
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,400
popular pretty damn quick. We all know Muk of the Artist, but let's talk about Muk of the

102
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,280
Typographer. This is from an era known as Art Nouveau, which translates in French to literally

103
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,960
new art. Stylistically, it had a lot of organic elements and lots of plants and nature, which

104
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,680
were contrast with big, harsh lines. And all of the typefaces that came along with it naturally

105
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,400
followed suit. The mix of ornate, gooey lines with straight, harsh lines was just perfect for the

106
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,280
Latin alphabet. And as for the impact of Art Nouveau, it sent a message to designers all around the

107
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:40,000
world. You can morph the letters more than you think, and they will still be legible. After years

108
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,120
and years of focusing so heavily on the function of typography, we now put form in the spotlight.

109
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,920
And naturally, some people used form as a weapon.

110
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,680
Cue Marinetti and his futuristic criticism of English traditions, of course,

111
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,440
written in chunky Sands Seraph type. This designer Marinetti in this letter, he calls out

112
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,840
basically all of the old British stuff, and he calls it the cream of snobbish earth.

113
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,920
Typographically, that snobbery could be seen in a new font that had just hit the streets.

114
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,840
In 1931, in Britain, there was this paper, The Times, that commissioned a guy called Stanley

115
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:16,560
Morrison to create their new body copy typeface. And he was like, well, I guess I'll base it on

116
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,440
maybe like those old Roman letters, that clarity, and it's for The Times. You know what, I'm gonna

117
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,760
call it Times New Roman. Oh yeah, little did he know that he was going to create one of the most

118
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:31,120
popular fonts of all time, bonkers. Now back to Marinetti in that letter, right? So this all comes

119
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,440
at the dawn of the First World War, which as you can imagine plays a major role in our story.

120
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,280
So during the war, you've got all these futurists and artists and creative people who all need a

121
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,760
safe haven, and quite a lot of them end up fleeing to Zurich. Now in Zurich, you've got all these

122
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,520
diverse backgrounds, various influences, you've got all these bright people, but you've also got

123
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,800
this backdrop of chaos, the world around them is falling to pieces. So naturally, this breeds a

124
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:59,760
new movement. Dadaism. This is a Dadaist typographic poster by Ilya Zdanovich. Notice the combination

125
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,320
of seraphs, sans seraphs, and dingbats. What are dingbats, you ask? So do you remember the

126
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,520
whole printing press thing? Basically when they would make pages, they might put these like

127
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,440
ornate symbols and stuff at the top and the bottom, and they were their own stamps. Dingbats.

128
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,840
So if that's the great grandfather, the great grandchild is Wingdings, but we'll get there later.

129
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,000
For now, for the Dadaists, they're symbols. Why symbols? There's a pretty good Marcel Duchamp

130
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,880
quote that kind of sums it up. The only thing worse than a seraph typeface is a sans seraph typeface.

131
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,720
This was the attitude, and it led to quite a lot of people doing things like using punctuation

132
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,560
instead of letters, as well as other people just generally criticising the limitations of the Roman

133
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,160
alphabet. Now meanwhile, a couple of borders east, right? We've got some pretty cool stuff going on.

134
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,880
We have the Russian typographic revolution. Artists like Vavara Stepanova are shooting

135
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,600
constructivist designs. This meant big, harsh geometry, quite a lot of symmetry, and harsh

136
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,000
blocky fonts that would conform to both it as well as the page. Complimenting Stepanova was

137
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,960
Alexander Rodchenko. His ability to blend graphics and shapes and text, it was just honestly flawless.

138
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,440
While I know the roots of modern graphic design are debatable, I always feel like Rodchenko and

139
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,200
Stepanova should get just a little bit more credit. Just a little bit more, you know?

140
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:10,080
So with all of these different aesthetics going on, was there a golden standard? Was there a

141
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:15,440
unified way where everybody agreed that this was the way that we should write a letter? Well,

142
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,840
those were the questions that were asked by pioneers of the Bauhaus movement. They sought to

143
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:24,400
create a uniform, perfect aesthetic, which of course came with a uniform, perfect typeface.

144
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,560
This guy. Herbert Bayer. In 1925, he set out to create the universal typeface,

145
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,040
a geometric alphabet based only on bars and circles. So this Herbert guy has got this idea,

146
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,040
which was basically as we progress into a society that uses more and more technology,

147
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,320
we would need a universally accepted way to communicate letters in the most efficient

148
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,480
map. The great grandchild of Bayer's dream font can still be found today on computers everywhere,

149
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,960
and it's simply called Bauhaus. What I love about this movement is that within it is a

150
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,640
genuine hope for utopia, but sadly utopia didn't happen. World War II did. After the Second World

151
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,120
War, thanks to constructivism and Bauhaus, we start to get a rise of a new style. This sort of

152
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:07,120
Swiss modernism. The key feature of modernism is that it is without ornament. No frills. You can

153
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,680
see it best in a font like Helvetica. Now, because this Swiss style was just embracing modernism,

154
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,760
what it meant is that there were no ties to the old world, which also meant that there were no ties

155
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,720
to that huge tragedy that just happened. The Second World War. But it was actually quite well

156
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,120
understood across the globe. Because of this, the Swiss style is also sometimes known as the

157
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,000
international typographic style. For a minute, there was this glimmer of hope that this international

158
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,600
Swiss style would unite people into that utopia that Bauhaus had dreamed of. But ironically,

159
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,160
one of the biggest adopters of the international style was the American corporation.

160
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,120
TV shows, record companies and advertisers all embraced it wholeheartedly, and you can see it

161
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,200
so much in the pop culture from that era. This isn't to say it was bad. It was amazing. From

162
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,840
the 50s and the 60s, we get these cool grotesque letters, mid-century letters, the droopy kind

163
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:58,400
of hippie font that sort of looks a bit Art Nouveau, this Art Deco revival, Western Slab Serif,

164
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:03,200
even cool sci-fi stuff. It was a cool time for graphic design, which means it's probably about

165
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:11,920
the time that we bring up Paul Rand. It is quite hard to properly articulate just how influential

166
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,240
Paul Rand is on the world of graphic design. So I'm just going to use a Steve Jobs quote.

167
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,960
Steve Jobs called Paul Rand the greatest living graphic designer, obviously when he was alive,

168
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:25,120
rest in peace. And looking at his work, it's not hard to say why. Paul Rand's theory was that

169
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,000
graphic design had this amazing ability to be a universal language based on simplicity and geometry.

170
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,160
He just loved it. In fact, he loved it so much that he even changed his name. It's a sad reason

171
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,080
why he did. He had a Jewish name, Peretz Rosenbaum, and he anglicised it to be a little bit more

172
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:42,560
Madison Avenue friendly. But when he did pick this name, he thought, four letters, four letters,

173
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:48,080
that'll make a great graphic symbol. He even put graphic design in his freaking name, man. Wow.

174
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,640
So that's a very brief overview of the international style and the gigantic design boom that it

175
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:58,240
created. But as you can imagine, not everybody was on board with this futuristic dream. And they

176
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:04,000
really, really wanted you to know it. The font rebels are back. Critics of the international

177
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,160
style, they felt like all this clean, flawless modernity. It was trying to say that life was

178
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,360
perfect. And life just wasn't. Enter the pop artist of the 1960s, most notably Andy Warhol,

179
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,520
people who were on a mission to satirise modernism in all of its icon heavy glory.

180
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:21,840
Now it's one thing to satirise a movement, but in the 1970s, there emerged a group of people

181
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:27,520
who wanted to just rebel against it all together. Punks. Remember that guy, Marinetti, who called

182
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:32,160
the old English stuff snobbish? Punks were feeling the same about modernism. They felt like it just,

183
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,320
I don't know, lacked humanity, lacked realness. There were no mistakes. What's up with that?

184
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,160
So the punks rebelled. And typographically, we can see it really clearly through things like

185
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,800
zines and album covers. These zines were full of handwriting, typographic errors, and letra

186
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,680
set transfers that broke all the rules. And while we're on the topic, let's talk about Jamie Reed.

187
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,880
He quite literally tore apart designs to make new ones. And in doing so, he sent a very powerful

188
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,680
message. Mainstream culture sucks, and we're here to destroy it. God save the queen.

189
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,760
All right, quick little break to talk about this shirt. So the first thing you might notice is,

190
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,000
wow, what a silly and fun font. How whims are cool. Second thing you might notice is it says

191
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,080
Struthless. That's my freaking channel name because that's my freaking shirt, baby. And where do I

192
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:21,360
sell that shirt? Shopify. That's right. We are going into today's relevant sponsor. All right,

193
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,960
so Shopify, if you don't know, they're a commerce platform. Definitely come across the Shopify

194
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,480
website online. They power like millions of businesses in hundreds of different countries.

195
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,120
But what is really cool at the moment, if you have been thinking lately, damn, I wouldn't

196
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,600
mind starting my own shop, you know, getting creative, building little something. Well,

197
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,800
Shopify right now has something called a starter plan. What this is, is you can make your own shop

198
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:48,720
literally like within minutes without code, put up products, use all the tools for just five dollars.

199
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,480
If it goes great, you then have the option to upgrade it and turn it into a full store. If it

200
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,560
doesn't, hey, gave it a shot. And that's pretty cool too. If you're keen, if you want to build

201
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,040
shop for five bucks, use this link, which I will put in the description and enjoy.

202
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,440
There you are. Back to the video. So what happens next? What is next in our typographic story?

203
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,200
Welcome to the 1980s. There was New Wave, radical modernism, 8-bit, and things that were being

204
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,680
inspired not by what technology could do, but by the constraints that they put on the designers.

205
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,240
And of course, the rise of the graphic designer getting taken seriously as an artist. And I think

206
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,440
the person who probably best embodied this era of graphic design and typography was Tibor Carman.

207
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,000
Carman had this strong belief that design was a path to ethical justice. He was the editor of

208
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,840
Colors Magazine, which was a magazine dedicated to uniting the world and promoting social good and

209
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:42,160
making actual change. He would vocally oppose working with unethical companies and who goes

210
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,640
far as to call out designers who would. He was a provocateur and a bad boy, but ultimately he was

211
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:52,560
also a strong moral compass in the design landscape. I think his legacy lies not as much in his work

212
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:58,160
as in who he was. Sure, he was a typographer. Sure, he was a designer, but because he was so

213
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:03,360
outspoken with his beliefs, he made the job of graphic design not only known, but really,

214
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,120
really cool. And this is basically around the time that Hollywood and TV get on board.

215
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,640
Let's say you've got a quirky character, but you also want to give him a professional streak.

216
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,160
What do you do? I'm a graphic designer. I'm a graphic designer. Graphic designer. Graphic design.

217
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,320
Graphic design. You're a graphic designer. You must be really artistic. And with great

218
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:25,040
graphic design comes great typography. Uncle Ben. Sans. So you've got all this graphic design

219
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,880
grounds well, and people are getting more curious about the profession. But the thing that made

220
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:37,120
it really take off was a certain guy in a certain turtleneck. Steve Brecken Jobs. The guy who found

221
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,280
at Apple, the guy who thought Paul Ram was so brilliant, and the guy who inspired my 2015

222
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,840
Halloween costume. Sexy Steve Jobs. And he was also the guy who, yes, as the legend goes,

223
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,440
took a calligraphy class in college and then a couple of years later decided, you know what,

224
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,280
computer should have all of those silly words on him too. He brought fonts to the Apple computer.

225
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,440
To do this, you've got a designer slash art historian slash all-around genius called Susan

226
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,600
Care. She's responsible for a bunch of fonts named after a bunch of cities like Chicago,

227
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,560
Geneva, Monaco, Los Angeles. And she's also the designer behind the Happy Max symbol.

228
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,320
What a resume. Steve Jobs gets a lot of credit for this font revolution moment,

229
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,840
but I feel like the designer should too, and Susan Care is clearly one of the best.

230
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:19,040
So as you can imagine, fonts go onto computers and basically this is like a huge typographic

231
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:23,040
explosion. Imagine it's the late 80s and you're just a casual user of your computer,

232
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:28,160
and then all of a sudden you're like, whoa, dude, I can change the writing on this word doc. That

233
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:33,360
is wild. I know it sounds normal to us, but back then it gave people a lot of agency when it came

234
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,720
to designing stuff. It really put the power into their hands. Now, I have a bit of a confession.

235
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,760
I have been using the words font and typeface relatively interchangeably up until this point.

236
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,160
And that's actually not technically correct. What we know as a font, like a computer font,

237
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,400
that's actually just called a typeface. And a font technically is the way that you alter that

238
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:58,080
typeface. So things like line weight, italics, boldness, even size, technically aerial size 12

239
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,400
is a different font to aerial size 14. Now, the reason that these two words are confused in our

240
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:08,400
modern day vocabulary is because of Steve Brick and Jobs. He, when he put them onto his Apple

241
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,000
computer, he was just like, you know what, let's call them fonts. And I don't know whether for

242
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,080
him it was a genuine mistake or whether he just liked the word fonts and was just like, screw it,

243
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:21,040
they're fonts now. See ya. But in any case, Steve Jobs is why we call typefaces fonts. But before

244
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,960
we critique his mistake, we also must remember that putting fonts on personal computers was

245
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,200
pretty much the biggest typographic shift since the printing press. So what do people do with all

246
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:35,840
this power? Stylistically grunge was pretty much the polar opposite of the international style.

247
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,760
This is David Carson. He was a surfer from California who sprung into the spotlight when

248
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,000
he was made head graphic designer for Ray Gunn magazine. With this alternative publication,

249
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,520
David Carson turned graphic design on its head. Carson saw type in pretty much like the least

250
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:54,480
functional way possible. He saw text as like an image or a texture or a decoration. There's this

251
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,080
one time. This is like one of those graphic design legends that you always hear where basically

252
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,400
Ray Gunn magazine had this interview with Brian Ferry and Carson and the editors took one look

253
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,720
and they're like, dude, this interview is super boring. So Carson's like, I've got an idea.

254
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,280
How about instead of printing this in a normal font, we print the entire interview in Zapf dingbats,

255
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:17,040
basically windings, symbols. He really didn't care if you could read it or not. Legibility was

256
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:21,440
not at the forefront of his priorities. So just like grunge music, Carson had his critics as well.

257
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,520
They would say things like, ah, you're killing the legibility of typography. Ah, it sucks. Nobody

258
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:31,280
likes this. But just like with grunge music, Carson doubled down. And yeah, it worked. This

259
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,440
typography, this design aesthetic, it gets cool. And then all of a sudden corporate America wants

260
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,400
a slice to appeal to the youth. All they had to do was use a Carson like aesthetic, right?

261
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,160
How do you do, fellow kids? But Carson had a career to make and he ended up working with a lot of

262
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,080
these people. Here's a grunge piece that was literally made for Microsoft. How cool is that?

263
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,640
And speaking of Microsoft, I think it's about time that we talk about it. The elephant in the room?

264
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,640
Are you ready? The thing that happened in 1994?

265
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,360
Some of you might feel a temptation to skip this section. Some of you might feel a temptation to

266
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:08,000
call me out or drag me or try and cancel me for saying the words that I'm about to say.

267
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:13,040
But I promise you, if you can stomach them, we will all be better because of it.

268
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:17,200
In 1994, Microsoft came out with one of the most iconic fonts of all time.

269
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,040
Comic Sans. I don't know. He has terrible taste in fonts. Now, a lot of us today, we see Comic

270
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,320
Sans as a meme. It's sort of the font that it's fun to hate or the font that, you know,

271
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,640
you might use if you're trying to convey irony. But in researching this, I found out that the

272
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,520
impact of Comic Sans is like way bigger than I thought. So this dude here, his name is Vincent

273
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,720
Conair. He made fonts like Trebuchet, Wild Style, Magpie, Webdings. Actually, one of his

274
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,480
dingbats from that font would eventually become this emoji. Side note, this is the greatest

275
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,040
emoji of all time. And yes, this is a hill I will die on. And he also made, this is super random,

276
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:54,080
but the Ministry of Sound logo. And yes, Vincent Conair also made Comic Sans.

277
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,000
The story of how it came to be was basically it was a solution to a problem that I guess

278
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,960
a designer would probably notice before many other people. There was this dog called Rover,

279
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,880
who when you would start up a Microsoft computer, the dog's job was to guide you through how to

280
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,280
use the computer, bucko. And basically the dog had these speech bubbles. But Vincent Conair was

281
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:17,280
like, man, sort of not that appropriate for this dog to be talking in this harsh times new Roman.

282
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,600
You know, it's a bit formal for a dog. Woof, woof, sir. So he was like, well, let's make something

283
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,480
a bit more playful. And he was a fan of comic books like DC, Watchmen. And he's like, maybe I can

284
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,520
make a font sort of based on comic books. Comic Sans blew up immediately. It was just an instant

285
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,920
hit. And the reason is, well, let's say you are making a birthday invite for a four year old.

286
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:40,240
Hello, children. Nah, we're not going to use the times new Roman. It just doesn't work. We need

287
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,200
something that tonally suits playful or cheerful or whimsical. You got church flyers, school

288
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,280
certificates, friendly emails, birthday cards. There were so many pieces of writing all around

289
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,520
the world that just didn't warrant formality. And Comic Sans was the missing puzzle piece.

290
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:58,400
But of course, with popularity comes haters. Maybe you were one of them. There's lots and lots

291
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,880
of examples of people inappropriately using Comic Sans, which is such a strange sentence,

292
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,720
but I'll just give you one which I think illustrates it best. In 2012, there was this

293
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,920
Dutch World War II Memorial that was set up, right? And you know what font they chose?

294
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,480
Comic Sans. Now, eventually they would scrap it and the people who made it said it was for

295
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,680
legibility. But I think we all know why. But even in that act is such a strange graphic design

296
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:25,520
question. How is the way that you write a letter somehow inappropriate? That's weird, right?

297
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,440
Now, Comic Sans on the more positive end of the spectrum actually has a couple of really cool

298
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,160
features that make it quite practical. For example, it doesn't really use mirrored glyphs. So a glyph

299
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:38,720
might be like a B, which when mirrored might look like a lowercase D. Comic Sans didn't do that.

300
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,880
They had two individual letters. And because of this, Comic Sans is really good for people with

301
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:48,000
dyslexia. And also, Comic Sans really opened the floodgates for all of the fun 90s text moments.

302
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,640
You know, Comic Sans warped so that word art could fly so that all of the crazy fun 90 stuff

303
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,200
could soar. Thanks, Comic Sans. Now, of course, this is probably a time to mention that it is not

304
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:03,600
the only controversial font. Let's have a little moment for the rest of them. Papyrus by Chris

305
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:11,840
Costello. Trayan by Carol Twombly, aka the movie poster font. Jokerman by Andrew K. Smith. And Curls

306
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:17,920
MT by Carl Crossgrove and Steve Madison. Just taking a moment. Just a little moment for them.

307
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:22,000
Now, to sum up this section on Comic Sans, I think I'm just going to go ahead and quote

308
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,720
Vincent Cornere himself. If you love Comic Sans, you don't know much about typography. But if you

309
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:34,720
hate Comic Sans, you really don't know much about typography either. Amen. The 2000s. We're too

310
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,440
now in our typographic journey. You know, we've got fonts on computers. Comic Sans starting to get

311
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,120
a little couple of haters. We've got the Y2K aesthetic. There's a bit going on. Mostly the

312
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,600
thing that defines this era is technology. Digital design was getting easier. Your company's like

313
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,920
Adobe pumping money into these products that were just facilitating more complex designs. And from

314
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:56,480
that, we've got more complex typography. The 2000s saw a lot of 3D lettering, skeuomorphism,

315
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,120
and maximalism. On top of this, there were far more articulated trend cycles. If one tech company

316
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,360
had a cool 3D logo, then all of a sudden, all the tech companies had a cool 3D logo. Or if a

317
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,120
rapper was like, you know what, I'm going to make all my Slab Serif font have this gold stroke and

318
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,160
be encrusted with diamonds. Yeah, a bunch of other rappers followed suit. So if that's the 2000s,

319
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:22,560
we all know what happens next, right? We're back here now. Neat. So the internet starts to hit

320
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:27,280
critical mass and maturity. So between that, all these font sharing websites, indie foundries popping

321
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:33,440
up, memes, and of course, Photoshop piracy, typography starts to have a big moment. One

322
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,240
interesting font to mention here is one that had a revival. It was created in the 1960s by Jeffrey

323
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,760
Lee, but it found a new home online. Impact. Or I should say it's the typeface impact and the font

324
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,560
was white stylized with that black stroke impact font. It was the font for memes. That's huge.

325
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:53,520
That's like getting your dream job as a font. The other very important macroeconomic force to

326
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,720
mention is hipsters. Yeah, hipsters bought two main movements into the spotlight. The first was

327
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,680
the revival of the signwriting aesthetic, multiple clashing fonts designed to look good and compliment

328
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:07,520
each other in one big sign. The fonts that defined this era weren't the ones that came standard

329
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,880
with your computer. They were the ones that you downloaded from the internet. It was fonts like

330
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:16,160
Babis New by Rayu Chitsukinawa or Lobster by Pablo Impallari, every burger shop font ever,

331
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:20,320
and the smooth and chunky glorious Cubano by Charles Van Der Water. So if that's the first

332
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:26,000
movement, what was the second? Sleek minimalism. That international style is back. Let's go,

333
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,800
Switzerland. Whoo. Like I said before, no font epitomized this movement better than Helvetica.

334
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:35,920
Helvetica was created in 1957 by the Haas type foundry as part of that international typographic

335
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:40,480
style. And true to its name, it is very much international. We've since seen Helvetica in

336
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,000
multiple different alphabets. While I know that this video is mostly about the Roman alphabet,

337
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,160
Helvetica is one of those ones that transcends. But the real question is, why did this font from

338
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:55,440
the 50s suddenly get a breath of new life in the 2010s? The answer is once again, Steve freaking

339
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:01,360
jobs. Yep, Helvetica was the main choice of the Apple iOS pretty much up until 2015, which of course

340
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,680
gave it a huge cop following a documentary and visibility in so many other corporate identities.

341
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,320
Helvetica was used as a corporate wordmark for the following companies.

342
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:15,520
But of this international age, the most important thing was just how accessible

343
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,600
typeface creation became. Technology just got real good and anybody can make a font. In the same

344
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,920
way anyone can now just make a YouTube video. It's really, really cool. Yep, Cambrian explosion of

345
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:30,160
fonts. There are indie designers making fonts upon fonts upon fonts and it is amazing. And honestly,

346
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:34,560
it's kind of beautiful because I feel like that is the whole aim of typography. It's sharing,

347
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,120
it's communicating and it's collaborating. And it's also probably I think how we should sum this all up.

348
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:46,320
From clay carvings and cuneiform to comic sans and cubano, I feel like the aim of typography

349
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:51,520
has always sat alongside with the aim of the idealist. Symbols were originally made to facilitate

350
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,680
trade and a better life and they ushered in civilization. Fonts are one of those things that

351
00:27:55,680 --> 00:28:01,280
honestly before starting this, I sort of overlooked as just a nice quirky feature of design. And I've

352
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,800
realized now that's because they're meant to be overlooked. When they're at their best, they are

353
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:09,440
facilitating information. Half the time fonts are working without anybody even knowing that

354
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,680
they're working. So I guess the right place to end this is by answering that original question

355
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:18,640
that I asked. Where do all these fonts come from? They come from Dynastic China, the Phoenicians,

356
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,320
the Renaissance, they come from Switzerland, they come from you and me, they come from people on

357
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,240
the internet uploading fonts that they think are cool. And what do all these people have in common?

358
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:32,800
They all contributed to a multiple millennia long ongoing mission, the mission to connect.

359
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:37,200
They all knew that words could only ever say so much and so they morphed the glyphs to say

360
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,480
even more. These people were so eager to convey meaning with words, they looked beyond the words

361
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:48,080
themselves. And yeah, the written word, the actual content, it really does show our desire to

362
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:57,280
communicate. But fonts, fonts show just how deep that desire goes. So I guess what I am trying to say

363
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:04,160
is this. The next time you feel like humanity is doomed, we're all isolated and everything

364
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:10,880
is going downhill. Just uh, I don't know man. Stare a little longer at something that you've

365
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:17,440
overlooked. Because that desire to connect and the depth of that desire, you can see it in

366
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:29,040
everything. Fonts and all.
