Some of them are formal, others playful, some are scary, ironic, important, timeless,

00:06.720 --> 00:11.600
trans, weird, wonderful, and some of them should not be used as subtitles for Avatar.

00:20.640 --> 00:27.440
This is the story of Fox, but it's also the story of civilization, creativity, innovation, power,

00:27.440 --> 00:32.160
obsession, war, love, and human connection. Okay, I can hear it in my voice,

00:32.160 --> 00:36.640
and if right now you're thinking, dude, that sounds like way too much to derive from

00:36.640 --> 00:42.560
Jokerman, don't worry. Because before I made this doco, that's what I thought too. Also,

00:42.560 --> 00:46.880
just want to say a big thanks to Shopify for sponsoring this video, more on them later though.

00:46.880 --> 00:54.000
For now, let's get weird. So this video started because I asked myself a pretty simple question.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.640
I was looking at the fonts on my computer and I just thought, where do all of these fonts come from?

00:58.640 --> 01:01.760
I thought the answer would be simple. I thought it was just people designing stuff for word

01:01.760 --> 01:06.720
processors. I pulled that thread and it was long before computers, so I was thinking, yeah,

01:06.720 --> 01:11.440
maybe it starts at the printing press. But then I was like, well, how do we have all those

01:11.440 --> 01:15.280
symbols? How do we know what to put in the printing press? So then I pulled that thread,

01:15.280 --> 01:19.280
then I pulled another thread, then I pulled another thread, and you know what, let's just say we

01:19.360 --> 01:28.720
have to go back. Like, way back. Our story starts 10,000 years ago in ancient Mesopotamia.

01:30.480 --> 01:34.160
Yep, we're starting at the start. Basically, imagine you're a guy, you've got some goats,

01:34.160 --> 01:38.160
they've got some chickens, but really what you want is oil. Because you can't make a

01:38.160 --> 01:42.000
trade immediately, you need something that represents chicken, goats, wheat, oil, all of

01:42.000 --> 01:45.600
the stuff that you would be trading. And so the ancient Mesopotamians made something called

01:45.600 --> 01:50.320
clay boulay, basically big clay symbols that would represent various things. They had them

01:50.320 --> 01:54.960
in about 16 categories. So imagine you've got a goat stone or a grain stone or an oil stone.

01:54.960 --> 01:58.960
Now, the reason that this is important to our story is because of the mechanic that is going on

01:58.960 --> 02:04.160
here. Things are being represented by the image of things. Instead of chickens, you have a clay

02:04.160 --> 02:09.040
rock that says chickens. And this idea of representing things with symbols would go on to form the basis

02:09.600 --> 02:16.160
of cuneiform. This is an actual fish. This is a pictogram of a fish. This is that pictogram

02:16.160 --> 02:21.200
sideways. Here's it abstracted. And this right here is cuneiform for fish. Graphic symbols

02:21.200 --> 02:25.040
depicting things. Cuneiform is some of the earliest forms we have of a formal written

02:25.040 --> 02:28.560
language. In terms of font properties, one thing that we can note here is that cuneiform was often

02:28.560 --> 02:32.400
read left to right. And the leading thesis is that more people were right-handed, so they wouldn't

02:32.400 --> 02:36.720
smudge the clay that they were carving in as they wrote. It's kind of cool. But what is also very

02:36.720 --> 02:41.680
cool is that cuneiform would eventually become one of the most famous ancient alphabets, the hieroglyphics

02:41.680 --> 02:45.200
of ancient Egypt. So at this point in the video, you might be thinking, cool, man, but what does

02:45.200 --> 02:50.560
this all have to do with the fonts of my computer? Well, let me get there. So time ticks on, various

02:50.560 --> 02:54.240
civilizations rise and fall, and we get all of these cool little examples of alphabets popping up

02:54.240 --> 02:58.480
in various forms of writing coming across the globe. But our next stop in this history tour

02:58.480 --> 03:04.720
comes in ancient Greece. What the Phoenicians did is they took a good look at the hieroglyphics.

03:04.720 --> 03:10.080
Now, like, yeah, love that. But what if we made the symbols even more abstract? And what if we

03:10.080 --> 03:13.760
atomized their value so that they could form larger words as opposed to just being symbols?

03:13.760 --> 03:19.760
These 22 letters, these symbols carved into stone are called Greek lapidary letters. It's an amazing

03:19.760 --> 03:23.760
innovation because you could write so many things. And these stone carvings right here are among the

03:23.760 --> 03:28.080
first formal use of Western letter forms. Now, there were a couple of problems with this early

03:28.080 --> 03:32.400
alphabet from the Greeks. They only had uppercase. And while it was written in rows, the way that

03:32.400 --> 03:35.840
you would read it would change. Sometimes you'd read left to right, other times right to left.

03:35.840 --> 03:40.640
This is a format known as Bustrefidon, or as the Greeks called it, as the ox plows.

03:40.640 --> 03:44.400
One second this way, one second that way. You just wait till they hear about palindromes.

03:44.400 --> 03:50.480
Do nine men interpret nine men I nod? Oh, sure. But yeah, basically, there's a couple of kinks

03:50.480 --> 03:56.800
to be ironed out. Enter the Romans. Yeah. Welcome to Rome. Ancient Rome took those Greek lapidary

03:56.800 --> 04:00.400
letters and they turned them into their own alphabet, the Roman alphabet, the Latin alphabet,

04:00.400 --> 04:03.440
the one that we still kind of use today. Now, at this point in the story, I've mostly been

04:03.440 --> 04:07.440
talking about alphabets, but the Romans also did something in terms of font. When they had

04:07.440 --> 04:11.840
their characters written out, they gave them little hats and little feet. These hats and feet

04:11.840 --> 04:22.800
are what we call serifs. More on that later. For now, let's talk about mass production.

04:25.360 --> 04:29.360
Like with so many inventions, as the old phrase goes, there's always something pretty cool going

04:29.360 --> 04:33.840
on in dynastic China. What you're looking at right here is a movable type system. It was invented

04:33.840 --> 04:38.800
in the 11th century in the Song Dynasty in China by Vixiang. It was a typing machine that was made

04:38.800 --> 04:42.880
from ceramics that allowed the user to reprint words onto clay. It saved them time and meant that

04:42.880 --> 04:46.480
you can mass produce messaging. Over the next four centuries, there were certain innovations

04:46.480 --> 04:51.600
made to this, mostly using materials. The earliest metal ones that we've seen are from Korea in 1230,

04:51.600 --> 04:56.160
but the machine that really got things going, as you guessed it, was the printing press. The year

04:56.160 --> 05:01.440
is 1440, and a goldsmith named Johannes Gutenberg invents this contraption right here. This printing

05:01.440 --> 05:04.880
press was a machine that could mass produce lettering. The way it worked was you'd have these

05:04.880 --> 05:08.320
letters that you'd put into a machine, and they would almost act like a stamp on the paper,

05:08.320 --> 05:12.800
and then that paper could go off and form books. But books were around before 1440, I hear you say,

05:12.800 --> 05:17.520
yeah, that is true. But those books just weren't printed. They were actually written by hand.

05:17.520 --> 05:21.840
Imagine writing a Bible by hand. In fact, this is a task that was done by monks, and when they did

05:21.840 --> 05:25.360
write those Bibles by hand, they would use a calligraphy style, which we now know is black

05:25.360 --> 05:30.080
letter. And because that was Gutenberg's reference for books, his printing press's first ever font

05:30.080 --> 05:34.320
was a black letter font. A grandchild of this might be like the old English font, you know,

05:34.320 --> 05:38.560
the one that people get like their birth years tattoo on them with, that. In any case, what you

05:38.560 --> 05:43.360
are looking at right here is the first ever printed book, the Gutenberg Bible, with the first ever

05:43.360 --> 05:50.080
printed Roman typeface, black letter. So I've got the printing press going on, and it has its one

05:50.080 --> 05:54.880
typeface. But 30 years later, we get a new innovation. A fella called Nicholas Jensen comes

05:54.880 --> 05:58.880
along and he's like, man, I don't reckon that black letter stuff. I just don't think it's that

05:58.880 --> 06:03.360
legible. What if we changed it? He was inspired by some of the cleaner letters, the serif letters

06:03.360 --> 06:08.480
from the ancient Romans. And so he created what he called a Roman typeface. This less cluttered,

06:08.480 --> 06:13.040
more legible style was naturally an immediate hit. In fact, it's still kind of a hit today.

06:13.040 --> 06:16.880
Open up a random book in your bookshelf, and you'll probably see a Roman type font. Now,

06:16.880 --> 06:21.120
as you can imagine, once this new font drops, all of these other designers and innovators,

06:21.120 --> 06:24.400
they also want to put their mark on history. They want to contribute. And what we start to see

06:24.400 --> 06:29.840
is a rise in foundries all over Europe, places whose job it was to make typefaces. The humanist

06:29.840 --> 06:35.040
spirit that was driving the Italian Renaissance also came with its own style of writing. Cursiva

06:35.040 --> 06:40.720
humanistica, the thing that paved the way for italics. So meanwhile, right in mid century 16th

06:40.720 --> 06:45.840
France, there's this other fella, this designer called Claude Garamond, who kept writing like this.

06:45.840 --> 06:50.960
This elegant style was so revolutionary that we still actually use his font to this day. Garamond.

06:50.960 --> 06:54.560
Great work, Claude. So over the next few centuries, we see designers like Fleischmann,

06:54.560 --> 06:59.520
Baskerville, Badoni, but all of these designers had one thing in common. While their fonts were

06:59.520 --> 07:05.280
amazing and brilliant, they were still riffing on a familiar theme. Seraphs. It's a variation on

07:05.280 --> 07:10.720
the same font that the Romans were using, almost two millennia prior. But what about something simpler?

07:13.200 --> 07:17.760
Sands without Seraph. Seraph. They didn't have Seraphs. Also known as grotesque. Now,

07:17.840 --> 07:22.800
Sands Seraph was actually used, but it didn't enter the printing game until 1816. And this is

07:22.800 --> 07:26.080
partially just because people didn't see it as formal enough to warrant its own typeface in a

07:26.080 --> 07:31.280
printing press. Until this guy enters, William Kelsen IV. What up? What you're looking at here

07:31.280 --> 07:36.960
is Kelsen Egyptian, the first known Sands Seraph typeface. Pretty cool. I actually really like it.

07:36.960 --> 07:40.480
So 12 years later, right? This other dude, Vincent Figgins, he makes the second ever

07:40.480 --> 07:45.520
Sands Seraph typeface. And as you can see, they are completely different. The first obvious difference

07:45.520 --> 07:50.160
is the line weight. The Figgins font is huge, which means, oh yeah, it commands attention.

07:50.160 --> 07:54.000
So in the 1800s, we're starting to see the rise of advertisements and posters. And for these people

07:54.000 --> 07:59.520
making this type of communication, this Sands Seraph font was a godsend. It commanded attention,

07:59.520 --> 08:04.400
it dictated page hierarchy, and of course, it was legible at a decent distance. So all of these

08:04.400 --> 08:08.720
practical uses, plus the fact that the aesthetic just said new, it made Sands Seraph get pretty

08:08.720 --> 08:12.400
popular pretty damn quick. We all know Muk of the Artist, but let's talk about Muk of the

08:12.400 --> 08:17.280
Typographer. This is from an era known as Art Nouveau, which translates in French to literally

08:17.280 --> 08:20.960
new art. Stylistically, it had a lot of organic elements and lots of plants and nature, which

08:20.960 --> 08:25.680
were contrast with big, harsh lines. And all of the typefaces that came along with it naturally

08:25.680 --> 08:30.400
followed suit. The mix of ornate, gooey lines with straight, harsh lines was just perfect for the

08:30.400 --> 08:35.280
Latin alphabet. And as for the impact of Art Nouveau, it sent a message to designers all around the

08:35.280 --> 08:40.000
world. You can morph the letters more than you think, and they will still be legible. After years

08:40.000 --> 08:45.120
and years of focusing so heavily on the function of typography, we now put form in the spotlight.

08:45.120 --> 08:47.920
And naturally, some people used form as a weapon.

08:51.760 --> 08:55.680
Cue Marinetti and his futuristic criticism of English traditions, of course,

08:55.680 --> 08:59.440
written in chunky Sands Seraph type. This designer Marinetti in this letter, he calls out

08:59.440 --> 09:03.840
basically all of the old British stuff, and he calls it the cream of snobbish earth.

09:03.840 --> 09:07.920
Typographically, that snobbery could be seen in a new font that had just hit the streets.

09:07.920 --> 09:11.840
In 1931, in Britain, there was this paper, The Times, that commissioned a guy called Stanley

09:11.840 --> 09:16.560
Morrison to create their new body copy typeface. And he was like, well, I guess I'll base it on

09:16.560 --> 09:21.440
maybe like those old Roman letters, that clarity, and it's for The Times. You know what, I'm gonna

09:21.440 --> 09:25.760
call it Times New Roman. Oh yeah, little did he know that he was going to create one of the most

09:25.760 --> 09:31.120
popular fonts of all time, bonkers. Now back to Marinetti in that letter, right? So this all comes

09:31.120 --> 09:35.440
at the dawn of the First World War, which as you can imagine plays a major role in our story.

09:35.440 --> 09:39.280
So during the war, you've got all these futurists and artists and creative people who all need a

09:39.280 --> 09:43.760
safe haven, and quite a lot of them end up fleeing to Zurich. Now in Zurich, you've got all these

09:43.760 --> 09:47.520
diverse backgrounds, various influences, you've got all these bright people, but you've also got

09:47.520 --> 09:52.800
this backdrop of chaos, the world around them is falling to pieces. So naturally, this breeds a

09:52.800 --> 09:59.760
new movement. Dadaism. This is a Dadaist typographic poster by Ilya Zdanovich. Notice the combination

09:59.760 --> 10:04.320
of seraphs, sans seraphs, and dingbats. What are dingbats, you ask? So do you remember the

10:04.320 --> 10:07.520
whole printing press thing? Basically when they would make pages, they might put these like

10:07.520 --> 10:11.440
ornate symbols and stuff at the top and the bottom, and they were their own stamps. Dingbats.

10:11.440 --> 10:15.840
So if that's the great grandfather, the great grandchild is Wingdings, but we'll get there later.

10:15.840 --> 10:20.000
For now, for the Dadaists, they're symbols. Why symbols? There's a pretty good Marcel Duchamp

10:20.000 --> 10:24.880
quote that kind of sums it up. The only thing worse than a seraph typeface is a sans seraph typeface.

10:24.880 --> 10:28.720
This was the attitude, and it led to quite a lot of people doing things like using punctuation

10:28.720 --> 10:32.560
instead of letters, as well as other people just generally criticising the limitations of the Roman

10:32.560 --> 10:36.160
alphabet. Now meanwhile, a couple of borders east, right? We've got some pretty cool stuff going on.

10:36.160 --> 10:40.880
We have the Russian typographic revolution. Artists like Vavara Stepanova are shooting

10:40.880 --> 10:45.600
constructivist designs. This meant big, harsh geometry, quite a lot of symmetry, and harsh

10:45.600 --> 10:50.000
blocky fonts that would conform to both it as well as the page. Complimenting Stepanova was

10:50.000 --> 10:54.960
Alexander Rodchenko. His ability to blend graphics and shapes and text, it was just honestly flawless.

10:54.960 --> 10:59.440
While I know the roots of modern graphic design are debatable, I always feel like Rodchenko and

10:59.440 --> 11:03.200
Stepanova should get just a little bit more credit. Just a little bit more, you know?

11:04.160 --> 11:10.080
So with all of these different aesthetics going on, was there a golden standard? Was there a

11:10.080 --> 11:15.440
unified way where everybody agreed that this was the way that we should write a letter? Well,

11:15.440 --> 11:19.840
those were the questions that were asked by pioneers of the Bauhaus movement. They sought to

11:19.840 --> 11:24.400
create a uniform, perfect aesthetic, which of course came with a uniform, perfect typeface.

11:24.880 --> 11:30.560
This guy. Herbert Bayer. In 1925, he set out to create the universal typeface,

11:30.560 --> 11:35.040
a geometric alphabet based only on bars and circles. So this Herbert guy has got this idea,

11:35.040 --> 11:39.040
which was basically as we progress into a society that uses more and more technology,

11:39.040 --> 11:42.320
we would need a universally accepted way to communicate letters in the most efficient

11:42.320 --> 11:46.480
map. The great grandchild of Bayer's dream font can still be found today on computers everywhere,

11:46.480 --> 11:50.960
and it's simply called Bauhaus. What I love about this movement is that within it is a

11:51.040 --> 11:56.640
genuine hope for utopia, but sadly utopia didn't happen. World War II did. After the Second World

11:56.640 --> 12:01.120
War, thanks to constructivism and Bauhaus, we start to get a rise of a new style. This sort of

12:01.120 --> 12:07.120
Swiss modernism. The key feature of modernism is that it is without ornament. No frills. You can

12:07.120 --> 12:11.680
see it best in a font like Helvetica. Now, because this Swiss style was just embracing modernism,

12:11.680 --> 12:15.760
what it meant is that there were no ties to the old world, which also meant that there were no ties

12:15.760 --> 12:20.720
to that huge tragedy that just happened. The Second World War. But it was actually quite well

12:20.720 --> 12:25.120
understood across the globe. Because of this, the Swiss style is also sometimes known as the

12:25.120 --> 12:30.000
international typographic style. For a minute, there was this glimmer of hope that this international

12:30.000 --> 12:35.600
Swiss style would unite people into that utopia that Bauhaus had dreamed of. But ironically,

12:35.600 --> 12:40.160
one of the biggest adopters of the international style was the American corporation.

12:40.160 --> 12:45.120
TV shows, record companies and advertisers all embraced it wholeheartedly, and you can see it

12:45.120 --> 12:49.200
so much in the pop culture from that era. This isn't to say it was bad. It was amazing. From

12:49.200 --> 12:53.840
the 50s and the 60s, we get these cool grotesque letters, mid-century letters, the droopy kind

12:53.840 --> 12:58.400
of hippie font that sort of looks a bit Art Nouveau, this Art Deco revival, Western Slab Serif,

12:58.400 --> 13:03.200
even cool sci-fi stuff. It was a cool time for graphic design, which means it's probably about

13:03.200 --> 13:11.920
the time that we bring up Paul Rand. It is quite hard to properly articulate just how influential

13:11.920 --> 13:16.240
Paul Rand is on the world of graphic design. So I'm just going to use a Steve Jobs quote.

13:16.240 --> 13:20.960
Steve Jobs called Paul Rand the greatest living graphic designer, obviously when he was alive,

13:20.960 --> 13:25.120
rest in peace. And looking at his work, it's not hard to say why. Paul Rand's theory was that

13:25.120 --> 13:30.000
graphic design had this amazing ability to be a universal language based on simplicity and geometry.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.160
He just loved it. In fact, he loved it so much that he even changed his name. It's a sad reason

13:34.160 --> 13:38.080
why he did. He had a Jewish name, Peretz Rosenbaum, and he anglicised it to be a little bit more

13:38.080 --> 13:42.560
Madison Avenue friendly. But when he did pick this name, he thought, four letters, four letters,

13:42.560 --> 13:48.080
that'll make a great graphic symbol. He even put graphic design in his freaking name, man. Wow.

13:48.080 --> 13:52.640
So that's a very brief overview of the international style and the gigantic design boom that it

13:52.640 --> 13:58.240
created. But as you can imagine, not everybody was on board with this futuristic dream. And they

13:58.240 --> 14:04.000
really, really wanted you to know it. The font rebels are back. Critics of the international

14:04.000 --> 14:08.160
style, they felt like all this clean, flawless modernity. It was trying to say that life was

14:08.160 --> 14:13.360
perfect. And life just wasn't. Enter the pop artist of the 1960s, most notably Andy Warhol,

14:13.360 --> 14:17.520
people who were on a mission to satirise modernism in all of its icon heavy glory.

14:17.520 --> 14:21.840
Now it's one thing to satirise a movement, but in the 1970s, there emerged a group of people

14:21.840 --> 14:27.520
who wanted to just rebel against it all together. Punks. Remember that guy, Marinetti, who called

14:27.520 --> 14:32.160
the old English stuff snobbish? Punks were feeling the same about modernism. They felt like it just,

14:32.160 --> 14:36.320
I don't know, lacked humanity, lacked realness. There were no mistakes. What's up with that?

14:36.320 --> 14:40.160
So the punks rebelled. And typographically, we can see it really clearly through things like

14:40.160 --> 14:44.800
zines and album covers. These zines were full of handwriting, typographic errors, and letra

14:44.800 --> 14:49.680
set transfers that broke all the rules. And while we're on the topic, let's talk about Jamie Reed.

14:49.680 --> 14:54.880
He quite literally tore apart designs to make new ones. And in doing so, he sent a very powerful

14:54.880 --> 14:59.680
message. Mainstream culture sucks, and we're here to destroy it. God save the queen.

15:01.920 --> 15:05.760
All right, quick little break to talk about this shirt. So the first thing you might notice is,

15:05.760 --> 15:10.000
wow, what a silly and fun font. How whims are cool. Second thing you might notice is it says

15:10.000 --> 15:14.080
Struthless. That's my freaking channel name because that's my freaking shirt, baby. And where do I

15:14.080 --> 15:21.360
sell that shirt? Shopify. That's right. We are going into today's relevant sponsor. All right,

15:21.360 --> 15:24.960
so Shopify, if you don't know, they're a commerce platform. Definitely come across the Shopify

15:24.960 --> 15:28.480
website online. They power like millions of businesses in hundreds of different countries.

15:28.480 --> 15:33.120
But what is really cool at the moment, if you have been thinking lately, damn, I wouldn't

15:33.200 --> 15:37.600
mind starting my own shop, you know, getting creative, building little something. Well,

15:37.600 --> 15:42.800
Shopify right now has something called a starter plan. What this is, is you can make your own shop

15:42.800 --> 15:48.720
literally like within minutes without code, put up products, use all the tools for just five dollars.

15:48.720 --> 15:52.480
If it goes great, you then have the option to upgrade it and turn it into a full store. If it

15:52.480 --> 15:56.560
doesn't, hey, gave it a shot. And that's pretty cool too. If you're keen, if you want to build

15:56.560 --> 16:01.040
shop for five bucks, use this link, which I will put in the description and enjoy.

16:01.600 --> 16:07.440
There you are. Back to the video. So what happens next? What is next in our typographic story?

16:10.160 --> 16:15.200
Welcome to the 1980s. There was New Wave, radical modernism, 8-bit, and things that were being

16:15.200 --> 16:19.680
inspired not by what technology could do, but by the constraints that they put on the designers.

16:19.680 --> 16:24.240
And of course, the rise of the graphic designer getting taken seriously as an artist. And I think

16:24.240 --> 16:29.440
the person who probably best embodied this era of graphic design and typography was Tibor Carman.

16:29.440 --> 16:34.000
Carman had this strong belief that design was a path to ethical justice. He was the editor of

16:34.000 --> 16:37.840
Colors Magazine, which was a magazine dedicated to uniting the world and promoting social good and

16:37.840 --> 16:42.160
making actual change. He would vocally oppose working with unethical companies and who goes

16:42.160 --> 16:46.640
far as to call out designers who would. He was a provocateur and a bad boy, but ultimately he was

16:46.640 --> 16:52.560
also a strong moral compass in the design landscape. I think his legacy lies not as much in his work

16:52.560 --> 16:58.160
as in who he was. Sure, he was a typographer. Sure, he was a designer, but because he was so

16:58.160 --> 17:03.360
outspoken with his beliefs, he made the job of graphic design not only known, but really,

17:03.360 --> 17:07.120
really cool. And this is basically around the time that Hollywood and TV get on board.

17:07.120 --> 17:10.640
Let's say you've got a quirky character, but you also want to give him a professional streak.

17:10.640 --> 17:16.160
What do you do? I'm a graphic designer. I'm a graphic designer. Graphic designer. Graphic design.

17:16.160 --> 17:20.320
Graphic design. You're a graphic designer. You must be really artistic. And with great

17:20.320 --> 17:25.040
graphic design comes great typography. Uncle Ben. Sans. So you've got all this graphic design

17:25.040 --> 17:28.880
grounds well, and people are getting more curious about the profession. But the thing that made

17:28.880 --> 17:37.120
it really take off was a certain guy in a certain turtleneck. Steve Brecken Jobs. The guy who found

17:37.120 --> 17:41.280
at Apple, the guy who thought Paul Ram was so brilliant, and the guy who inspired my 2015

17:41.280 --> 17:45.840
Halloween costume. Sexy Steve Jobs. And he was also the guy who, yes, as the legend goes,

17:45.840 --> 17:49.440
took a calligraphy class in college and then a couple of years later decided, you know what,

17:49.440 --> 17:53.280
computer should have all of those silly words on him too. He brought fonts to the Apple computer.

17:53.280 --> 17:57.440
To do this, you've got a designer slash art historian slash all-around genius called Susan

17:57.440 --> 18:01.600
Care. She's responsible for a bunch of fonts named after a bunch of cities like Chicago,

18:01.600 --> 18:06.560
Geneva, Monaco, Los Angeles. And she's also the designer behind the Happy Max symbol.

18:06.560 --> 18:10.320
What a resume. Steve Jobs gets a lot of credit for this font revolution moment,

18:10.320 --> 18:13.840
but I feel like the designer should too, and Susan Care is clearly one of the best.

18:13.840 --> 18:19.040
So as you can imagine, fonts go onto computers and basically this is like a huge typographic

18:19.040 --> 18:23.040
explosion. Imagine it's the late 80s and you're just a casual user of your computer,

18:23.040 --> 18:28.160
and then all of a sudden you're like, whoa, dude, I can change the writing on this word doc. That

18:28.160 --> 18:33.360
is wild. I know it sounds normal to us, but back then it gave people a lot of agency when it came

18:33.360 --> 18:38.720
to designing stuff. It really put the power into their hands. Now, I have a bit of a confession.

18:38.720 --> 18:43.760
I have been using the words font and typeface relatively interchangeably up until this point.

18:43.760 --> 18:48.160
And that's actually not technically correct. What we know as a font, like a computer font,

18:48.160 --> 18:52.400
that's actually just called a typeface. And a font technically is the way that you alter that

18:52.400 --> 18:58.080
typeface. So things like line weight, italics, boldness, even size, technically aerial size 12

18:58.080 --> 19:02.400
is a different font to aerial size 14. Now, the reason that these two words are confused in our

19:02.400 --> 19:08.400
modern day vocabulary is because of Steve Brick and Jobs. He, when he put them onto his Apple

19:08.400 --> 19:12.000
computer, he was just like, you know what, let's call them fonts. And I don't know whether for

19:12.000 --> 19:16.080
him it was a genuine mistake or whether he just liked the word fonts and was just like, screw it,

19:16.080 --> 19:21.040
they're fonts now. See ya. But in any case, Steve Jobs is why we call typefaces fonts. But before

19:21.040 --> 19:24.960
we critique his mistake, we also must remember that putting fonts on personal computers was

19:24.960 --> 19:29.200
pretty much the biggest typographic shift since the printing press. So what do people do with all

19:29.200 --> 19:35.840
this power? Stylistically grunge was pretty much the polar opposite of the international style.

19:35.840 --> 19:39.760
This is David Carson. He was a surfer from California who sprung into the spotlight when

19:39.760 --> 19:44.000
he was made head graphic designer for Ray Gunn magazine. With this alternative publication,

19:44.000 --> 19:49.520
David Carson turned graphic design on its head. Carson saw type in pretty much like the least

19:49.520 --> 19:54.480
functional way possible. He saw text as like an image or a texture or a decoration. There's this

19:54.480 --> 19:58.080
one time. This is like one of those graphic design legends that you always hear where basically

19:58.080 --> 20:02.400
Ray Gunn magazine had this interview with Brian Ferry and Carson and the editors took one look

20:02.400 --> 20:06.720
and they're like, dude, this interview is super boring. So Carson's like, I've got an idea.

20:06.720 --> 20:11.280
How about instead of printing this in a normal font, we print the entire interview in Zapf dingbats,

20:11.280 --> 20:17.040
basically windings, symbols. He really didn't care if you could read it or not. Legibility was

20:17.040 --> 20:21.440
not at the forefront of his priorities. So just like grunge music, Carson had his critics as well.

20:21.440 --> 20:25.520
They would say things like, ah, you're killing the legibility of typography. Ah, it sucks. Nobody

20:25.520 --> 20:31.280
likes this. But just like with grunge music, Carson doubled down. And yeah, it worked. This

20:31.280 --> 20:35.440
typography, this design aesthetic, it gets cool. And then all of a sudden corporate America wants

20:35.440 --> 20:40.400
a slice to appeal to the youth. All they had to do was use a Carson like aesthetic, right?

20:40.400 --> 20:44.160
How do you do, fellow kids? But Carson had a career to make and he ended up working with a lot of

20:44.160 --> 20:48.080
these people. Here's a grunge piece that was literally made for Microsoft. How cool is that?

20:48.080 --> 20:52.640
And speaking of Microsoft, I think it's about time that we talk about it. The elephant in the room?

20:53.520 --> 20:56.640
Are you ready? The thing that happened in 1994?

20:58.880 --> 21:03.360
Some of you might feel a temptation to skip this section. Some of you might feel a temptation to

21:03.920 --> 21:08.000
call me out or drag me or try and cancel me for saying the words that I'm about to say.

21:08.800 --> 21:13.040
But I promise you, if you can stomach them, we will all be better because of it.

21:13.040 --> 21:17.200
In 1994, Microsoft came out with one of the most iconic fonts of all time.

21:18.320 --> 21:23.040
Comic Sans. I don't know. He has terrible taste in fonts. Now, a lot of us today, we see Comic

21:23.040 --> 21:26.320
Sans as a meme. It's sort of the font that it's fun to hate or the font that, you know,

21:26.320 --> 21:30.640
you might use if you're trying to convey irony. But in researching this, I found out that the

21:30.640 --> 21:35.520
impact of Comic Sans is like way bigger than I thought. So this dude here, his name is Vincent

21:35.520 --> 21:40.720
Conair. He made fonts like Trebuchet, Wild Style, Magpie, Webdings. Actually, one of his

21:40.720 --> 21:44.480
dingbats from that font would eventually become this emoji. Side note, this is the greatest

21:44.480 --> 21:49.040
emoji of all time. And yes, this is a hill I will die on. And he also made, this is super random,

21:49.040 --> 21:54.080
but the Ministry of Sound logo. And yes, Vincent Conair also made Comic Sans.

21:54.080 --> 21:58.000
The story of how it came to be was basically it was a solution to a problem that I guess

21:58.000 --> 22:02.960
a designer would probably notice before many other people. There was this dog called Rover,

22:02.960 --> 22:06.880
who when you would start up a Microsoft computer, the dog's job was to guide you through how to

22:06.880 --> 22:11.280
use the computer, bucko. And basically the dog had these speech bubbles. But Vincent Conair was

22:11.280 --> 22:17.280
like, man, sort of not that appropriate for this dog to be talking in this harsh times new Roman.

22:17.280 --> 22:21.600
You know, it's a bit formal for a dog. Woof, woof, sir. So he was like, well, let's make something

22:21.600 --> 22:26.480
a bit more playful. And he was a fan of comic books like DC, Watchmen. And he's like, maybe I can

22:26.480 --> 22:31.520
make a font sort of based on comic books. Comic Sans blew up immediately. It was just an instant

22:31.520 --> 22:35.920
hit. And the reason is, well, let's say you are making a birthday invite for a four year old.

22:35.920 --> 22:40.240
Hello, children. Nah, we're not going to use the times new Roman. It just doesn't work. We need

22:40.240 --> 22:45.200
something that tonally suits playful or cheerful or whimsical. You got church flyers, school

22:45.200 --> 22:49.280
certificates, friendly emails, birthday cards. There were so many pieces of writing all around

22:49.280 --> 22:53.520
the world that just didn't warrant formality. And Comic Sans was the missing puzzle piece.

22:53.520 --> 22:58.400
But of course, with popularity comes haters. Maybe you were one of them. There's lots and lots

22:58.400 --> 23:02.880
of examples of people inappropriately using Comic Sans, which is such a strange sentence,

23:02.880 --> 23:06.720
but I'll just give you one which I think illustrates it best. In 2012, there was this

23:06.720 --> 23:09.920
Dutch World War II Memorial that was set up, right? And you know what font they chose?

23:10.880 --> 23:14.480
Comic Sans. Now, eventually they would scrap it and the people who made it said it was for

23:14.480 --> 23:19.680
legibility. But I think we all know why. But even in that act is such a strange graphic design

23:19.680 --> 23:25.520
question. How is the way that you write a letter somehow inappropriate? That's weird, right?

23:25.600 --> 23:29.440
Now, Comic Sans on the more positive end of the spectrum actually has a couple of really cool

23:29.440 --> 23:34.160
features that make it quite practical. For example, it doesn't really use mirrored glyphs. So a glyph

23:34.160 --> 23:38.720
might be like a B, which when mirrored might look like a lowercase D. Comic Sans didn't do that.

23:38.720 --> 23:42.880
They had two individual letters. And because of this, Comic Sans is really good for people with

23:42.880 --> 23:48.000
dyslexia. And also, Comic Sans really opened the floodgates for all of the fun 90s text moments.

23:48.000 --> 23:52.640
You know, Comic Sans warped so that word art could fly so that all of the crazy fun 90 stuff

23:52.720 --> 23:57.200
could soar. Thanks, Comic Sans. Now, of course, this is probably a time to mention that it is not

23:57.200 --> 24:03.600
the only controversial font. Let's have a little moment for the rest of them. Papyrus by Chris

24:03.600 --> 24:11.840
Costello. Trayan by Carol Twombly, aka the movie poster font. Jokerman by Andrew K. Smith. And Curls

24:11.840 --> 24:17.920
MT by Carl Crossgrove and Steve Madison. Just taking a moment. Just a little moment for them.

24:18.560 --> 24:22.000
Now, to sum up this section on Comic Sans, I think I'm just going to go ahead and quote

24:22.000 --> 24:26.720
Vincent Cornere himself. If you love Comic Sans, you don't know much about typography. But if you

24:26.720 --> 24:34.720
hate Comic Sans, you really don't know much about typography either. Amen. The 2000s. We're too

24:34.720 --> 24:39.440
now in our typographic journey. You know, we've got fonts on computers. Comic Sans starting to get

24:39.440 --> 24:43.120
a little couple of haters. We've got the Y2K aesthetic. There's a bit going on. Mostly the

24:43.120 --> 24:47.600
thing that defines this era is technology. Digital design was getting easier. Your company's like

24:47.600 --> 24:51.920
Adobe pumping money into these products that were just facilitating more complex designs. And from

24:51.920 --> 24:56.480
that, we've got more complex typography. The 2000s saw a lot of 3D lettering, skeuomorphism,

24:56.480 --> 25:01.120
and maximalism. On top of this, there were far more articulated trend cycles. If one tech company

25:01.120 --> 25:05.360
had a cool 3D logo, then all of a sudden, all the tech companies had a cool 3D logo. Or if a

25:05.360 --> 25:09.120
rapper was like, you know what, I'm going to make all my Slab Serif font have this gold stroke and

25:09.120 --> 25:14.160
be encrusted with diamonds. Yeah, a bunch of other rappers followed suit. So if that's the 2000s,

25:14.720 --> 25:22.560
we all know what happens next, right? We're back here now. Neat. So the internet starts to hit

25:22.560 --> 25:27.280
critical mass and maturity. So between that, all these font sharing websites, indie foundries popping

25:27.280 --> 25:33.440
up, memes, and of course, Photoshop piracy, typography starts to have a big moment. One

25:33.440 --> 25:38.240
interesting font to mention here is one that had a revival. It was created in the 1960s by Jeffrey

25:38.240 --> 25:43.760
Lee, but it found a new home online. Impact. Or I should say it's the typeface impact and the font

25:43.760 --> 25:48.560
was white stylized with that black stroke impact font. It was the font for memes. That's huge.

25:48.560 --> 25:53.520
That's like getting your dream job as a font. The other very important macroeconomic force to

25:53.520 --> 25:58.720
mention is hipsters. Yeah, hipsters bought two main movements into the spotlight. The first was

25:58.720 --> 26:03.680
the revival of the signwriting aesthetic, multiple clashing fonts designed to look good and compliment

26:03.680 --> 26:07.520
each other in one big sign. The fonts that defined this era weren't the ones that came standard

26:07.520 --> 26:10.880
with your computer. They were the ones that you downloaded from the internet. It was fonts like

26:10.880 --> 26:16.160
Babis New by Rayu Chitsukinawa or Lobster by Pablo Impallari, every burger shop font ever,

26:16.160 --> 26:20.320
and the smooth and chunky glorious Cubano by Charles Van Der Water. So if that's the first

26:20.320 --> 26:26.000
movement, what was the second? Sleek minimalism. That international style is back. Let's go,

26:26.000 --> 26:30.800
Switzerland. Whoo. Like I said before, no font epitomized this movement better than Helvetica.

26:30.800 --> 26:35.920
Helvetica was created in 1957 by the Haas type foundry as part of that international typographic

26:35.920 --> 26:40.480
style. And true to its name, it is very much international. We've since seen Helvetica in

26:40.480 --> 26:44.000
multiple different alphabets. While I know that this video is mostly about the Roman alphabet,

26:44.000 --> 26:48.160
Helvetica is one of those ones that transcends. But the real question is, why did this font from

26:48.160 --> 26:55.440
the 50s suddenly get a breath of new life in the 2010s? The answer is once again, Steve freaking

26:55.440 --> 27:01.360
jobs. Yep, Helvetica was the main choice of the Apple iOS pretty much up until 2015, which of course

27:01.360 --> 27:05.680
gave it a huge cop following a documentary and visibility in so many other corporate identities.

27:05.680 --> 27:08.320
Helvetica was used as a corporate wordmark for the following companies.

27:11.920 --> 27:15.520
But of this international age, the most important thing was just how accessible

27:15.520 --> 27:19.600
typeface creation became. Technology just got real good and anybody can make a font. In the same

27:19.600 --> 27:23.920
way anyone can now just make a YouTube video. It's really, really cool. Yep, Cambrian explosion of

27:23.920 --> 27:30.160
fonts. There are indie designers making fonts upon fonts upon fonts and it is amazing. And honestly,

27:30.160 --> 27:34.560
it's kind of beautiful because I feel like that is the whole aim of typography. It's sharing,

27:34.640 --> 27:39.120
it's communicating and it's collaborating. And it's also probably I think how we should sum this all up.

27:41.040 --> 27:46.320
From clay carvings and cuneiform to comic sans and cubano, I feel like the aim of typography

27:46.320 --> 27:51.520
has always sat alongside with the aim of the idealist. Symbols were originally made to facilitate

27:51.520 --> 27:55.680
trade and a better life and they ushered in civilization. Fonts are one of those things that

27:55.680 --> 28:01.280
honestly before starting this, I sort of overlooked as just a nice quirky feature of design. And I've

28:01.280 --> 28:04.800
realized now that's because they're meant to be overlooked. When they're at their best, they are

28:04.800 --> 28:09.440
facilitating information. Half the time fonts are working without anybody even knowing that

28:09.440 --> 28:13.680
they're working. So I guess the right place to end this is by answering that original question

28:13.680 --> 28:18.640
that I asked. Where do all these fonts come from? They come from Dynastic China, the Phoenicians,

28:18.640 --> 28:22.320
the Renaissance, they come from Switzerland, they come from you and me, they come from people on

28:22.320 --> 28:26.240
the internet uploading fonts that they think are cool. And what do all these people have in common?

28:26.800 --> 28:32.800
They all contributed to a multiple millennia long ongoing mission, the mission to connect.

28:32.800 --> 28:37.200
They all knew that words could only ever say so much and so they morphed the glyphs to say

28:37.200 --> 28:42.480
even more. These people were so eager to convey meaning with words, they looked beyond the words

28:42.480 --> 28:48.080
themselves. And yeah, the written word, the actual content, it really does show our desire to

28:48.080 --> 28:57.280
communicate. But fonts, fonts show just how deep that desire goes. So I guess what I am trying to say

28:58.240 --> 29:04.160
is this. The next time you feel like humanity is doomed, we're all isolated and everything

29:04.160 --> 29:10.880
is going downhill. Just uh, I don't know man. Stare a little longer at something that you've

29:10.880 --> 29:17.440
overlooked. Because that desire to connect and the depth of that desire, you can see it in

29:18.080 --> 29:29.040
everything. Fonts and all.
