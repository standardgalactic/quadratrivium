6720	11600	trans, weird, wonderful, and some of them should not be used as subtitles for Avatar.
20640	27440	This is the story of Fox, but it's also the story of civilization, creativity, innovation, power,
27440	32160	obsession, war, love, and human connection. Okay, I can hear it in my voice,
32160	36640	and if right now you're thinking, dude, that sounds like way too much to derive from
36640	42560	Jokerman, don't worry. Because before I made this doco, that's what I thought too. Also,
42560	46880	just want to say a big thanks to Shopify for sponsoring this video, more on them later though.
46880	54000	For now, let's get weird. So this video started because I asked myself a pretty simple question.
54000	58640	I was looking at the fonts on my computer and I just thought, where do all of these fonts come from?
58640	61760	I thought the answer would be simple. I thought it was just people designing stuff for word
61760	66720	processors. I pulled that thread and it was long before computers, so I was thinking, yeah,
66720	71440	maybe it starts at the printing press. But then I was like, well, how do we have all those
71440	75280	symbols? How do we know what to put in the printing press? So then I pulled that thread,
75280	79280	then I pulled another thread, then I pulled another thread, and you know what, let's just say we
79360	88720	have to go back. Like, way back. Our story starts 10,000 years ago in ancient Mesopotamia.
90480	94160	Yep, we're starting at the start. Basically, imagine you're a guy, you've got some goats,
94160	98160	they've got some chickens, but really what you want is oil. Because you can't make a
98160	102000	trade immediately, you need something that represents chicken, goats, wheat, oil, all of
102000	105600	the stuff that you would be trading. And so the ancient Mesopotamians made something called
105600	110320	clay boulay, basically big clay symbols that would represent various things. They had them
110320	114960	in about 16 categories. So imagine you've got a goat stone or a grain stone or an oil stone.
114960	118960	Now, the reason that this is important to our story is because of the mechanic that is going on
118960	124160	here. Things are being represented by the image of things. Instead of chickens, you have a clay
124160	129040	rock that says chickens. And this idea of representing things with symbols would go on to form the basis
129600	136160	of cuneiform. This is an actual fish. This is a pictogram of a fish. This is that pictogram
136160	141200	sideways. Here's it abstracted. And this right here is cuneiform for fish. Graphic symbols
141200	145040	depicting things. Cuneiform is some of the earliest forms we have of a formal written
145040	148560	language. In terms of font properties, one thing that we can note here is that cuneiform was often
148560	152400	read left to right. And the leading thesis is that more people were right-handed, so they wouldn't
152400	156720	smudge the clay that they were carving in as they wrote. It's kind of cool. But what is also very
156720	161680	cool is that cuneiform would eventually become one of the most famous ancient alphabets, the hieroglyphics
161680	165200	of ancient Egypt. So at this point in the video, you might be thinking, cool, man, but what does
165200	170560	this all have to do with the fonts of my computer? Well, let me get there. So time ticks on, various
170560	174240	civilizations rise and fall, and we get all of these cool little examples of alphabets popping up
174240	178480	in various forms of writing coming across the globe. But our next stop in this history tour
178480	184720	comes in ancient Greece. What the Phoenicians did is they took a good look at the hieroglyphics.
184720	190080	Now, like, yeah, love that. But what if we made the symbols even more abstract? And what if we
190080	193760	atomized their value so that they could form larger words as opposed to just being symbols?
193760	199760	These 22 letters, these symbols carved into stone are called Greek lapidary letters. It's an amazing
199760	203760	innovation because you could write so many things. And these stone carvings right here are among the
203760	208080	first formal use of Western letter forms. Now, there were a couple of problems with this early
208080	212400	alphabet from the Greeks. They only had uppercase. And while it was written in rows, the way that
212400	215840	you would read it would change. Sometimes you'd read left to right, other times right to left.
215840	220640	This is a format known as Bustrefidon, or as the Greeks called it, as the ox plows.
220640	224400	One second this way, one second that way. You just wait till they hear about palindromes.
224400	230480	Do nine men interpret nine men I nod? Oh, sure. But yeah, basically, there's a couple of kinks
230480	236800	to be ironed out. Enter the Romans. Yeah. Welcome to Rome. Ancient Rome took those Greek lapidary
236800	240400	letters and they turned them into their own alphabet, the Roman alphabet, the Latin alphabet,
240400	243440	the one that we still kind of use today. Now, at this point in the story, I've mostly been
243440	247440	talking about alphabets, but the Romans also did something in terms of font. When they had
247440	251840	their characters written out, they gave them little hats and little feet. These hats and feet
251840	262800	are what we call serifs. More on that later. For now, let's talk about mass production.
265360	269360	Like with so many inventions, as the old phrase goes, there's always something pretty cool going
269360	273840	on in dynastic China. What you're looking at right here is a movable type system. It was invented
273840	278800	in the 11th century in the Song Dynasty in China by Vixiang. It was a typing machine that was made
278800	282880	from ceramics that allowed the user to reprint words onto clay. It saved them time and meant that
282880	286480	you can mass produce messaging. Over the next four centuries, there were certain innovations
286480	291600	made to this, mostly using materials. The earliest metal ones that we've seen are from Korea in 1230,
291600	296160	but the machine that really got things going, as you guessed it, was the printing press. The year
296160	301440	is 1440, and a goldsmith named Johannes Gutenberg invents this contraption right here. This printing
301440	304880	press was a machine that could mass produce lettering. The way it worked was you'd have these
304880	308320	letters that you'd put into a machine, and they would almost act like a stamp on the paper,
308320	312800	and then that paper could go off and form books. But books were around before 1440, I hear you say,
312800	317520	yeah, that is true. But those books just weren't printed. They were actually written by hand.
317520	321840	Imagine writing a Bible by hand. In fact, this is a task that was done by monks, and when they did
321840	325360	write those Bibles by hand, they would use a calligraphy style, which we now know is black
325360	330080	letter. And because that was Gutenberg's reference for books, his printing press's first ever font
330080	334320	was a black letter font. A grandchild of this might be like the old English font, you know,
334320	338560	the one that people get like their birth years tattoo on them with, that. In any case, what you
338560	343360	are looking at right here is the first ever printed book, the Gutenberg Bible, with the first ever
343360	350080	printed Roman typeface, black letter. So I've got the printing press going on, and it has its one
350080	354880	typeface. But 30 years later, we get a new innovation. A fella called Nicholas Jensen comes
354880	358880	along and he's like, man, I don't reckon that black letter stuff. I just don't think it's that
358880	363360	legible. What if we changed it? He was inspired by some of the cleaner letters, the serif letters
363360	368480	from the ancient Romans. And so he created what he called a Roman typeface. This less cluttered,
368480	373040	more legible style was naturally an immediate hit. In fact, it's still kind of a hit today.
373040	376880	Open up a random book in your bookshelf, and you'll probably see a Roman type font. Now,
376880	381120	as you can imagine, once this new font drops, all of these other designers and innovators,
381120	384400	they also want to put their mark on history. They want to contribute. And what we start to see
384400	389840	is a rise in foundries all over Europe, places whose job it was to make typefaces. The humanist
389840	395040	spirit that was driving the Italian Renaissance also came with its own style of writing. Cursiva
395040	400720	humanistica, the thing that paved the way for italics. So meanwhile, right in mid century 16th
400720	405840	France, there's this other fella, this designer called Claude Garamond, who kept writing like this.
405840	410960	This elegant style was so revolutionary that we still actually use his font to this day. Garamond.
410960	414560	Great work, Claude. So over the next few centuries, we see designers like Fleischmann,
414560	419520	Baskerville, Badoni, but all of these designers had one thing in common. While their fonts were
419520	425280	amazing and brilliant, they were still riffing on a familiar theme. Seraphs. It's a variation on
425280	430720	the same font that the Romans were using, almost two millennia prior. But what about something simpler?
433200	437760	Sands without Seraph. Seraph. They didn't have Seraphs. Also known as grotesque. Now,
437840	442800	Sands Seraph was actually used, but it didn't enter the printing game until 1816. And this is
442800	446080	partially just because people didn't see it as formal enough to warrant its own typeface in a
446080	451280	printing press. Until this guy enters, William Kelsen IV. What up? What you're looking at here
451280	456960	is Kelsen Egyptian, the first known Sands Seraph typeface. Pretty cool. I actually really like it.
456960	460480	So 12 years later, right? This other dude, Vincent Figgins, he makes the second ever
460480	465520	Sands Seraph typeface. And as you can see, they are completely different. The first obvious difference
465520	470160	is the line weight. The Figgins font is huge, which means, oh yeah, it commands attention.
470160	474000	So in the 1800s, we're starting to see the rise of advertisements and posters. And for these people
474000	479520	making this type of communication, this Sands Seraph font was a godsend. It commanded attention,
479520	484400	it dictated page hierarchy, and of course, it was legible at a decent distance. So all of these
484400	488720	practical uses, plus the fact that the aesthetic just said new, it made Sands Seraph get pretty
488720	492400	popular pretty damn quick. We all know Muk of the Artist, but let's talk about Muk of the
492400	497280	Typographer. This is from an era known as Art Nouveau, which translates in French to literally
497280	500960	new art. Stylistically, it had a lot of organic elements and lots of plants and nature, which
500960	505680	were contrast with big, harsh lines. And all of the typefaces that came along with it naturally
505680	510400	followed suit. The mix of ornate, gooey lines with straight, harsh lines was just perfect for the
510400	515280	Latin alphabet. And as for the impact of Art Nouveau, it sent a message to designers all around the
515280	520000	world. You can morph the letters more than you think, and they will still be legible. After years
520000	525120	and years of focusing so heavily on the function of typography, we now put form in the spotlight.
525120	527920	And naturally, some people used form as a weapon.
531760	535680	Cue Marinetti and his futuristic criticism of English traditions, of course,
535680	539440	written in chunky Sands Seraph type. This designer Marinetti in this letter, he calls out
539440	543840	basically all of the old British stuff, and he calls it the cream of snobbish earth.
543840	547920	Typographically, that snobbery could be seen in a new font that had just hit the streets.
547920	551840	In 1931, in Britain, there was this paper, The Times, that commissioned a guy called Stanley
551840	556560	Morrison to create their new body copy typeface. And he was like, well, I guess I'll base it on
556560	561440	maybe like those old Roman letters, that clarity, and it's for The Times. You know what, I'm gonna
561440	565760	call it Times New Roman. Oh yeah, little did he know that he was going to create one of the most
565760	571120	popular fonts of all time, bonkers. Now back to Marinetti in that letter, right? So this all comes
571120	575440	at the dawn of the First World War, which as you can imagine plays a major role in our story.
575440	579280	So during the war, you've got all these futurists and artists and creative people who all need a
579280	583760	safe haven, and quite a lot of them end up fleeing to Zurich. Now in Zurich, you've got all these
583760	587520	diverse backgrounds, various influences, you've got all these bright people, but you've also got
587520	592800	this backdrop of chaos, the world around them is falling to pieces. So naturally, this breeds a
592800	599760	new movement. Dadaism. This is a Dadaist typographic poster by Ilya Zdanovich. Notice the combination
599760	604320	of seraphs, sans seraphs, and dingbats. What are dingbats, you ask? So do you remember the
604320	607520	whole printing press thing? Basically when they would make pages, they might put these like
607520	611440	ornate symbols and stuff at the top and the bottom, and they were their own stamps. Dingbats.
611440	615840	So if that's the great grandfather, the great grandchild is Wingdings, but we'll get there later.
615840	620000	For now, for the Dadaists, they're symbols. Why symbols? There's a pretty good Marcel Duchamp
620000	624880	quote that kind of sums it up. The only thing worse than a seraph typeface is a sans seraph typeface.
624880	628720	This was the attitude, and it led to quite a lot of people doing things like using punctuation
628720	632560	instead of letters, as well as other people just generally criticising the limitations of the Roman
632560	636160	alphabet. Now meanwhile, a couple of borders east, right? We've got some pretty cool stuff going on.
636160	640880	We have the Russian typographic revolution. Artists like Vavara Stepanova are shooting
640880	645600	constructivist designs. This meant big, harsh geometry, quite a lot of symmetry, and harsh
645600	650000	blocky fonts that would conform to both it as well as the page. Complimenting Stepanova was
650000	654960	Alexander Rodchenko. His ability to blend graphics and shapes and text, it was just honestly flawless.
654960	659440	While I know the roots of modern graphic design are debatable, I always feel like Rodchenko and
659440	663200	Stepanova should get just a little bit more credit. Just a little bit more, you know?
664160	670080	So with all of these different aesthetics going on, was there a golden standard? Was there a
670080	675440	unified way where everybody agreed that this was the way that we should write a letter? Well,
675440	679840	those were the questions that were asked by pioneers of the Bauhaus movement. They sought to
679840	684400	create a uniform, perfect aesthetic, which of course came with a uniform, perfect typeface.
684880	690560	This guy. Herbert Bayer. In 1925, he set out to create the universal typeface,
690560	695040	a geometric alphabet based only on bars and circles. So this Herbert guy has got this idea,
695040	699040	which was basically as we progress into a society that uses more and more technology,
699040	702320	we would need a universally accepted way to communicate letters in the most efficient
702320	706480	map. The great grandchild of Bayer's dream font can still be found today on computers everywhere,
706480	710960	and it's simply called Bauhaus. What I love about this movement is that within it is a
711040	716640	genuine hope for utopia, but sadly utopia didn't happen. World War II did. After the Second World
716640	721120	War, thanks to constructivism and Bauhaus, we start to get a rise of a new style. This sort of
721120	727120	Swiss modernism. The key feature of modernism is that it is without ornament. No frills. You can
727120	731680	see it best in a font like Helvetica. Now, because this Swiss style was just embracing modernism,
731680	735760	what it meant is that there were no ties to the old world, which also meant that there were no ties
735760	740720	to that huge tragedy that just happened. The Second World War. But it was actually quite well
740720	745120	understood across the globe. Because of this, the Swiss style is also sometimes known as the
745120	750000	international typographic style. For a minute, there was this glimmer of hope that this international
750000	755600	Swiss style would unite people into that utopia that Bauhaus had dreamed of. But ironically,
755600	760160	one of the biggest adopters of the international style was the American corporation.
760160	765120	TV shows, record companies and advertisers all embraced it wholeheartedly, and you can see it
765120	769200	so much in the pop culture from that era. This isn't to say it was bad. It was amazing. From
769200	773840	the 50s and the 60s, we get these cool grotesque letters, mid-century letters, the droopy kind
773840	778400	of hippie font that sort of looks a bit Art Nouveau, this Art Deco revival, Western Slab Serif,
778400	783200	even cool sci-fi stuff. It was a cool time for graphic design, which means it's probably about
783200	791920	the time that we bring up Paul Rand. It is quite hard to properly articulate just how influential
791920	796240	Paul Rand is on the world of graphic design. So I'm just going to use a Steve Jobs quote.
796240	800960	Steve Jobs called Paul Rand the greatest living graphic designer, obviously when he was alive,
800960	805120	rest in peace. And looking at his work, it's not hard to say why. Paul Rand's theory was that
805120	810000	graphic design had this amazing ability to be a universal language based on simplicity and geometry.
810000	814160	He just loved it. In fact, he loved it so much that he even changed his name. It's a sad reason
814160	818080	why he did. He had a Jewish name, Peretz Rosenbaum, and he anglicised it to be a little bit more
818080	822560	Madison Avenue friendly. But when he did pick this name, he thought, four letters, four letters,
822560	828080	that'll make a great graphic symbol. He even put graphic design in his freaking name, man. Wow.
828080	832640	So that's a very brief overview of the international style and the gigantic design boom that it
832640	838240	created. But as you can imagine, not everybody was on board with this futuristic dream. And they
838240	844000	really, really wanted you to know it. The font rebels are back. Critics of the international
844000	848160	style, they felt like all this clean, flawless modernity. It was trying to say that life was
848160	853360	perfect. And life just wasn't. Enter the pop artist of the 1960s, most notably Andy Warhol,
853360	857520	people who were on a mission to satirise modernism in all of its icon heavy glory.
857520	861840	Now it's one thing to satirise a movement, but in the 1970s, there emerged a group of people
861840	867520	who wanted to just rebel against it all together. Punks. Remember that guy, Marinetti, who called
867520	872160	the old English stuff snobbish? Punks were feeling the same about modernism. They felt like it just,
872160	876320	I don't know, lacked humanity, lacked realness. There were no mistakes. What's up with that?
876320	880160	So the punks rebelled. And typographically, we can see it really clearly through things like
880160	884800	zines and album covers. These zines were full of handwriting, typographic errors, and letra
884800	889680	set transfers that broke all the rules. And while we're on the topic, let's talk about Jamie Reed.
889680	894880	He quite literally tore apart designs to make new ones. And in doing so, he sent a very powerful
894880	899680	message. Mainstream culture sucks, and we're here to destroy it. God save the queen.
901920	905760	All right, quick little break to talk about this shirt. So the first thing you might notice is,
905760	910000	wow, what a silly and fun font. How whims are cool. Second thing you might notice is it says
910000	914080	Struthless. That's my freaking channel name because that's my freaking shirt, baby. And where do I
914080	921360	sell that shirt? Shopify. That's right. We are going into today's relevant sponsor. All right,
921360	924960	so Shopify, if you don't know, they're a commerce platform. Definitely come across the Shopify
924960	928480	website online. They power like millions of businesses in hundreds of different countries.
928480	933120	But what is really cool at the moment, if you have been thinking lately, damn, I wouldn't
933200	937600	mind starting my own shop, you know, getting creative, building little something. Well,
937600	942800	Shopify right now has something called a starter plan. What this is, is you can make your own shop
942800	948720	literally like within minutes without code, put up products, use all the tools for just five dollars.
948720	952480	If it goes great, you then have the option to upgrade it and turn it into a full store. If it
952480	956560	doesn't, hey, gave it a shot. And that's pretty cool too. If you're keen, if you want to build
956560	961040	shop for five bucks, use this link, which I will put in the description and enjoy.
961600	967440	There you are. Back to the video. So what happens next? What is next in our typographic story?
970160	975200	Welcome to the 1980s. There was New Wave, radical modernism, 8-bit, and things that were being
975200	979680	inspired not by what technology could do, but by the constraints that they put on the designers.
979680	984240	And of course, the rise of the graphic designer getting taken seriously as an artist. And I think
984240	989440	the person who probably best embodied this era of graphic design and typography was Tibor Carman.
989440	994000	Carman had this strong belief that design was a path to ethical justice. He was the editor of
994000	997840	Colors Magazine, which was a magazine dedicated to uniting the world and promoting social good and
997840	1002160	making actual change. He would vocally oppose working with unethical companies and who goes
1002160	1006640	far as to call out designers who would. He was a provocateur and a bad boy, but ultimately he was
1006640	1012560	also a strong moral compass in the design landscape. I think his legacy lies not as much in his work
1012560	1018160	as in who he was. Sure, he was a typographer. Sure, he was a designer, but because he was so
1018160	1023360	outspoken with his beliefs, he made the job of graphic design not only known, but really,
1023360	1027120	really cool. And this is basically around the time that Hollywood and TV get on board.
1027120	1030640	Let's say you've got a quirky character, but you also want to give him a professional streak.
1030640	1036160	What do you do? I'm a graphic designer. I'm a graphic designer. Graphic designer. Graphic design.
1036160	1040320	Graphic design. You're a graphic designer. You must be really artistic. And with great
1040320	1045040	graphic design comes great typography. Uncle Ben. Sans. So you've got all this graphic design
1045040	1048880	grounds well, and people are getting more curious about the profession. But the thing that made
1048880	1057120	it really take off was a certain guy in a certain turtleneck. Steve Brecken Jobs. The guy who found
1057120	1061280	at Apple, the guy who thought Paul Ram was so brilliant, and the guy who inspired my 2015
1061280	1065840	Halloween costume. Sexy Steve Jobs. And he was also the guy who, yes, as the legend goes,
1065840	1069440	took a calligraphy class in college and then a couple of years later decided, you know what,
1069440	1073280	computer should have all of those silly words on him too. He brought fonts to the Apple computer.
1073280	1077440	To do this, you've got a designer slash art historian slash all-around genius called Susan
1077440	1081600	Care. She's responsible for a bunch of fonts named after a bunch of cities like Chicago,
1081600	1086560	Geneva, Monaco, Los Angeles. And she's also the designer behind the Happy Max symbol.
1086560	1090320	What a resume. Steve Jobs gets a lot of credit for this font revolution moment,
1090320	1093840	but I feel like the designer should too, and Susan Care is clearly one of the best.
1093840	1099040	So as you can imagine, fonts go onto computers and basically this is like a huge typographic
1099040	1103040	explosion. Imagine it's the late 80s and you're just a casual user of your computer,
1103040	1108160	and then all of a sudden you're like, whoa, dude, I can change the writing on this word doc. That
1108160	1113360	is wild. I know it sounds normal to us, but back then it gave people a lot of agency when it came
1113360	1118720	to designing stuff. It really put the power into their hands. Now, I have a bit of a confession.
1118720	1123760	I have been using the words font and typeface relatively interchangeably up until this point.
1123760	1128160	And that's actually not technically correct. What we know as a font, like a computer font,
1128160	1132400	that's actually just called a typeface. And a font technically is the way that you alter that
1132400	1138080	typeface. So things like line weight, italics, boldness, even size, technically aerial size 12
1138080	1142400	is a different font to aerial size 14. Now, the reason that these two words are confused in our
1142400	1148400	modern day vocabulary is because of Steve Brick and Jobs. He, when he put them onto his Apple
1148400	1152000	computer, he was just like, you know what, let's call them fonts. And I don't know whether for
1152000	1156080	him it was a genuine mistake or whether he just liked the word fonts and was just like, screw it,
1156080	1161040	they're fonts now. See ya. But in any case, Steve Jobs is why we call typefaces fonts. But before
1161040	1164960	we critique his mistake, we also must remember that putting fonts on personal computers was
1164960	1169200	pretty much the biggest typographic shift since the printing press. So what do people do with all
1169200	1175840	this power? Stylistically grunge was pretty much the polar opposite of the international style.
1175840	1179760	This is David Carson. He was a surfer from California who sprung into the spotlight when
1179760	1184000	he was made head graphic designer for Ray Gunn magazine. With this alternative publication,
1184000	1189520	David Carson turned graphic design on its head. Carson saw type in pretty much like the least
1189520	1194480	functional way possible. He saw text as like an image or a texture or a decoration. There's this
1194480	1198080	one time. This is like one of those graphic design legends that you always hear where basically
1198080	1202400	Ray Gunn magazine had this interview with Brian Ferry and Carson and the editors took one look
1202400	1206720	and they're like, dude, this interview is super boring. So Carson's like, I've got an idea.
1206720	1211280	How about instead of printing this in a normal font, we print the entire interview in Zapf dingbats,
1211280	1217040	basically windings, symbols. He really didn't care if you could read it or not. Legibility was
1217040	1221440	not at the forefront of his priorities. So just like grunge music, Carson had his critics as well.
1221440	1225520	They would say things like, ah, you're killing the legibility of typography. Ah, it sucks. Nobody
1225520	1231280	likes this. But just like with grunge music, Carson doubled down. And yeah, it worked. This
1231280	1235440	typography, this design aesthetic, it gets cool. And then all of a sudden corporate America wants
1235440	1240400	a slice to appeal to the youth. All they had to do was use a Carson like aesthetic, right?
1240400	1244160	How do you do, fellow kids? But Carson had a career to make and he ended up working with a lot of
1244160	1248080	these people. Here's a grunge piece that was literally made for Microsoft. How cool is that?
1248080	1252640	And speaking of Microsoft, I think it's about time that we talk about it. The elephant in the room?
1253520	1256640	Are you ready? The thing that happened in 1994?
1258880	1263360	Some of you might feel a temptation to skip this section. Some of you might feel a temptation to
1263920	1268000	call me out or drag me or try and cancel me for saying the words that I'm about to say.
1268800	1273040	But I promise you, if you can stomach them, we will all be better because of it.
1273040	1277200	In 1994, Microsoft came out with one of the most iconic fonts of all time.
1278320	1283040	Comic Sans. I don't know. He has terrible taste in fonts. Now, a lot of us today, we see Comic
1283040	1286320	Sans as a meme. It's sort of the font that it's fun to hate or the font that, you know,
1286320	1290640	you might use if you're trying to convey irony. But in researching this, I found out that the
1290640	1295520	impact of Comic Sans is like way bigger than I thought. So this dude here, his name is Vincent
1295520	1300720	Conair. He made fonts like Trebuchet, Wild Style, Magpie, Webdings. Actually, one of his
1300720	1304480	dingbats from that font would eventually become this emoji. Side note, this is the greatest
1304480	1309040	emoji of all time. And yes, this is a hill I will die on. And he also made, this is super random,
1309040	1314080	but the Ministry of Sound logo. And yes, Vincent Conair also made Comic Sans.
1314080	1318000	The story of how it came to be was basically it was a solution to a problem that I guess
1318000	1322960	a designer would probably notice before many other people. There was this dog called Rover,
1322960	1326880	who when you would start up a Microsoft computer, the dog's job was to guide you through how to
1326880	1331280	use the computer, bucko. And basically the dog had these speech bubbles. But Vincent Conair was
1331280	1337280	like, man, sort of not that appropriate for this dog to be talking in this harsh times new Roman.
1337280	1341600	You know, it's a bit formal for a dog. Woof, woof, sir. So he was like, well, let's make something
1341600	1346480	a bit more playful. And he was a fan of comic books like DC, Watchmen. And he's like, maybe I can
1346480	1351520	make a font sort of based on comic books. Comic Sans blew up immediately. It was just an instant
1351520	1355920	hit. And the reason is, well, let's say you are making a birthday invite for a four year old.
1355920	1360240	Hello, children. Nah, we're not going to use the times new Roman. It just doesn't work. We need
1360240	1365200	something that tonally suits playful or cheerful or whimsical. You got church flyers, school
1365200	1369280	certificates, friendly emails, birthday cards. There were so many pieces of writing all around
1369280	1373520	the world that just didn't warrant formality. And Comic Sans was the missing puzzle piece.
1373520	1378400	But of course, with popularity comes haters. Maybe you were one of them. There's lots and lots
1378400	1382880	of examples of people inappropriately using Comic Sans, which is such a strange sentence,
1382880	1386720	but I'll just give you one which I think illustrates it best. In 2012, there was this
1386720	1389920	Dutch World War II Memorial that was set up, right? And you know what font they chose?
1390880	1394480	Comic Sans. Now, eventually they would scrap it and the people who made it said it was for
1394480	1399680	legibility. But I think we all know why. But even in that act is such a strange graphic design
1399680	1405520	question. How is the way that you write a letter somehow inappropriate? That's weird, right?
1405600	1409440	Now, Comic Sans on the more positive end of the spectrum actually has a couple of really cool
1409440	1414160	features that make it quite practical. For example, it doesn't really use mirrored glyphs. So a glyph
1414160	1418720	might be like a B, which when mirrored might look like a lowercase D. Comic Sans didn't do that.
1418720	1422880	They had two individual letters. And because of this, Comic Sans is really good for people with
1422880	1428000	dyslexia. And also, Comic Sans really opened the floodgates for all of the fun 90s text moments.
1428000	1432640	You know, Comic Sans warped so that word art could fly so that all of the crazy fun 90 stuff
1432720	1437200	could soar. Thanks, Comic Sans. Now, of course, this is probably a time to mention that it is not
1437200	1443600	the only controversial font. Let's have a little moment for the rest of them. Papyrus by Chris
1443600	1451840	Costello. Trayan by Carol Twombly, aka the movie poster font. Jokerman by Andrew K. Smith. And Curls
1451840	1457920	MT by Carl Crossgrove and Steve Madison. Just taking a moment. Just a little moment for them.
1458560	1462000	Now, to sum up this section on Comic Sans, I think I'm just going to go ahead and quote
1462000	1466720	Vincent Cornere himself. If you love Comic Sans, you don't know much about typography. But if you
1466720	1474720	hate Comic Sans, you really don't know much about typography either. Amen. The 2000s. We're too
1474720	1479440	now in our typographic journey. You know, we've got fonts on computers. Comic Sans starting to get
1479440	1483120	a little couple of haters. We've got the Y2K aesthetic. There's a bit going on. Mostly the
1483120	1487600	thing that defines this era is technology. Digital design was getting easier. Your company's like
1487600	1491920	Adobe pumping money into these products that were just facilitating more complex designs. And from
1491920	1496480	that, we've got more complex typography. The 2000s saw a lot of 3D lettering, skeuomorphism,
1496480	1501120	and maximalism. On top of this, there were far more articulated trend cycles. If one tech company
1501120	1505360	had a cool 3D logo, then all of a sudden, all the tech companies had a cool 3D logo. Or if a
1505360	1509120	rapper was like, you know what, I'm going to make all my Slab Serif font have this gold stroke and
1509120	1514160	be encrusted with diamonds. Yeah, a bunch of other rappers followed suit. So if that's the 2000s,
1514720	1522560	we all know what happens next, right? We're back here now. Neat. So the internet starts to hit
1522560	1527280	critical mass and maturity. So between that, all these font sharing websites, indie foundries popping
1527280	1533440	up, memes, and of course, Photoshop piracy, typography starts to have a big moment. One
1533440	1538240	interesting font to mention here is one that had a revival. It was created in the 1960s by Jeffrey
1538240	1543760	Lee, but it found a new home online. Impact. Or I should say it's the typeface impact and the font
1543760	1548560	was white stylized with that black stroke impact font. It was the font for memes. That's huge.
1548560	1553520	That's like getting your dream job as a font. The other very important macroeconomic force to
1553520	1558720	mention is hipsters. Yeah, hipsters bought two main movements into the spotlight. The first was
1558720	1563680	the revival of the signwriting aesthetic, multiple clashing fonts designed to look good and compliment
1563680	1567520	each other in one big sign. The fonts that defined this era weren't the ones that came standard
1567520	1570880	with your computer. They were the ones that you downloaded from the internet. It was fonts like
1570880	1576160	Babis New by Rayu Chitsukinawa or Lobster by Pablo Impallari, every burger shop font ever,
1576160	1580320	and the smooth and chunky glorious Cubano by Charles Van Der Water. So if that's the first
1580320	1586000	movement, what was the second? Sleek minimalism. That international style is back. Let's go,
1586000	1590800	Switzerland. Whoo. Like I said before, no font epitomized this movement better than Helvetica.
1590800	1595920	Helvetica was created in 1957 by the Haas type foundry as part of that international typographic
1595920	1600480	style. And true to its name, it is very much international. We've since seen Helvetica in
1600480	1604000	multiple different alphabets. While I know that this video is mostly about the Roman alphabet,
1604000	1608160	Helvetica is one of those ones that transcends. But the real question is, why did this font from
1608160	1615440	the 50s suddenly get a breath of new life in the 2010s? The answer is once again, Steve freaking
1615440	1621360	jobs. Yep, Helvetica was the main choice of the Apple iOS pretty much up until 2015, which of course
1621360	1625680	gave it a huge cop following a documentary and visibility in so many other corporate identities.
1625680	1628320	Helvetica was used as a corporate wordmark for the following companies.
1631920	1635520	But of this international age, the most important thing was just how accessible
1635520	1639600	typeface creation became. Technology just got real good and anybody can make a font. In the same
1639600	1643920	way anyone can now just make a YouTube video. It's really, really cool. Yep, Cambrian explosion of
1643920	1650160	fonts. There are indie designers making fonts upon fonts upon fonts and it is amazing. And honestly,
1650160	1654560	it's kind of beautiful because I feel like that is the whole aim of typography. It's sharing,
1654640	1659120	it's communicating and it's collaborating. And it's also probably I think how we should sum this all up.
1661040	1666320	From clay carvings and cuneiform to comic sans and cubano, I feel like the aim of typography
1666320	1671520	has always sat alongside with the aim of the idealist. Symbols were originally made to facilitate
1671520	1675680	trade and a better life and they ushered in civilization. Fonts are one of those things that
1675680	1681280	honestly before starting this, I sort of overlooked as just a nice quirky feature of design. And I've
1681280	1684800	realized now that's because they're meant to be overlooked. When they're at their best, they are
1684800	1689440	facilitating information. Half the time fonts are working without anybody even knowing that
1689440	1693680	they're working. So I guess the right place to end this is by answering that original question
1693680	1698640	that I asked. Where do all these fonts come from? They come from Dynastic China, the Phoenicians,
1698640	1702320	the Renaissance, they come from Switzerland, they come from you and me, they come from people on
1702320	1706240	the internet uploading fonts that they think are cool. And what do all these people have in common?
1706800	1712800	They all contributed to a multiple millennia long ongoing mission, the mission to connect.
1712800	1717200	They all knew that words could only ever say so much and so they morphed the glyphs to say
1717200	1722480	even more. These people were so eager to convey meaning with words, they looked beyond the words
1722480	1728080	themselves. And yeah, the written word, the actual content, it really does show our desire to
1728080	1737280	communicate. But fonts, fonts show just how deep that desire goes. So I guess what I am trying to say
1738240	1744160	is this. The next time you feel like humanity is doomed, we're all isolated and everything
1744160	1750880	is going downhill. Just uh, I don't know man. Stare a little longer at something that you've
1750880	1757440	overlooked. Because that desire to connect and the depth of that desire, you can see it in
1758080	1769040	everything. Fonts and all.
