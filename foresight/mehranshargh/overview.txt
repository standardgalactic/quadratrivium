1. **Neutrinos as an analogy for Frege's distinction between sense and reference**: Quine uses the example of neutrinos to illustrate how the same word can be applied to two different entities with distinct properties without any confusion, similar to how Frege distinguishes between the sense (the mode of presentation) and reference (the actual object referred to) of a proper name or term.

2. **Numbers and ordered pairs**: Quine points out that numbers and ordered pairs are abstract objects that can be used interchangeably in certain contexts to fulfill a specific role, much like the neutrinos where the exact nature of the particle is less important than its function within the scientific framework.

3. **Ontological relativity**: This is Quine's thesis that the ontological commitments of a theory can be reshuffled without altering the truth-values of the statements of the theory. The entities we take as the referents of our terms are not fixed but can be reformulated one-to-one to other objects or classes within the same theory.

4. **Sensory associations**: In discussing ontological relativity, Quine emphasizes that while the objects themselves can be reinterpreted, the sensory qualities associated with them remain constant. The object's role in a theoretical framework can change, but the way we perceive and learn about these objects through experience does not.

5. **Influence on students**: Quine mentions some of his former students who have become successful philosophers or have pursued careers in other fields, such as Donald Davidson, Douglas Estelle, Eleanor (Estelle) Rae, and Roger Gibson, all of whom have continued the influence of his ideas.

In essence, Quine's discussion highlights the fluidity of ontological commitments and the distinction between the abstract aspects of language and the concrete sensory experiences that define our understanding of objects. Ontological relativity underscores the idea that our commitment to what exists is less about the entities themselves and more about the roles they play within our theories and the observation sentences that anchor our concepts through experience.
