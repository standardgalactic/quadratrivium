00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,800
Professor Warren Goldfab, chairman of the philosophy department

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,240
at Harvard University, is our guest panelist in this program.

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,520
He specializes in logic, history of logic,

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,920
and philosophy of mathematics, and has translated and edited

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,080
the logical writings of Jacques Herbrand.

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,840
He has also coauthored with Bertrand Reben the decision

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:32,200
problem in solvable classes of quantificational formulae.

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,440
The program begins with a discussion of Professor

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,360
Quine's early philosophical career at Harvard

10
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,440
and consideration of his relationship

11
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,040
with the logical positivists of the Vienna circle,

12
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,360
most notably with Rudolf Carnat.

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,080
This background sets the stage for a thorough discussion

14
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,640
of Quine's naturalism, and in particular,

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,480
his naturalized epistemology.

16
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,960
Questions about the famous two dogmas are raised,

17
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,200
and then attention is drawn to his doctrines of extensionalism

18
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,040
and ontological relativity.

19
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,800
We now join the discussion in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

20
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,560
Joining Professor Quine for this discussion are Warren Goldfab,

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,480
professor of philosophy at Harvard University,

22
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,040
Paul Horwich, professor of philosophy at MIT,

23
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,000
and Martin Davies, wild reader in mental philosophy

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,080
at Oxford University.

25
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:29,560
In 1932, the Quine set sail for Europe destination was Vienna.

26
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,080
Herbert Feigl, who was at Harvard University from Vienna

27
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,720
at that time, had suggested to Quine, who had already

28
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,040
achieved acclaim as a logician, that the main action in logic

29
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,800
would be found in Vienna, and perhaps in the person of Rudolf

30
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,040
Carnat, who was ultimately to play a great role in Quine's

31
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,000
development as a philosopher.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,160
Before going into the influence that the Vienna circle had

33
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:03,040
on your work, I'd like to ask you, what was the situation at

34
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,200
Harvard at that time, particularly in the field of logic?

35
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,640
At that time, logic was very weakened in America generally.

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,880
As far as I know, hardly any of them taught the subject.

37
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:26,800
Harvard was looked to, prided itself on being perhaps

38
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,200
the greatest center for logic in America.

39
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,280
After I'd been there for a little while,

40
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,880
I'd been there for a little while,

41
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,760
after I'd been there for a little while,

42
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,200
I came to feel that this was, well,

43
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,440
this profession reminded me of the Wizard of Oz.

44
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,480
I was learning virtually no logic that I hadn't already

45
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:07,040
imbibed as an undergraduate from my unsupervised honors

46
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,540
reading.

47
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,800
Pardon.

48
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,520
Who were the main characters at that time at Harvard?

49
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:23,240
In logic, the three names associated with logic were

50
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:28,960
Whitehead, Clarence Serving Lewis, and Harry Sheffer.

51
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,480
Whitehead, of course, with a very good reason,

52
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,320
because he and Bertrand Russell had done this monumental three

53
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:41,400
volume work on mathematical logic, the work that

54
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,480
was far and away the greatest thing in that subject,

55
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,160
and virtually the only great thing

56
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,640
that I'd become aware of up to then.

57
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,800
Lewis had done many years earlier.

58
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,280
In fact, as far back as 1918, the book

59
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,600
had appeared a survey of symbolic logic

60
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:15,200
in which he did a good job of reporting the developments

61
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,600
at the hands of Burs and Boulle and the others,

62
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,360
and some small extent, perhaps, Fraga.

63
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,800
His teaching, he was perhaps my most influential teacher,

64
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,560
from a point of view of straight classroom contact.

65
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,440
His course in Kant, and his course

66
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,120
in his own theory of knowledge.

67
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,240
He wasn't teaching logic.

68
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,280
What little logic I associated with him from reading,

69
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,400
I was not sympathetic with, because it was modal logic.

70
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,040
In fact, he was very much the pioneer, the American pioneer

71
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,800
in, or the pioneer, I should say, in the modal logic

72
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,480
of necessity.

73
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:09,160
Harry Shuffer was the one who was giving logic courses,

74
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,640
but they were just altogether too thin.

75
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:25,280
And there was no inkling of the current excitement

76
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:32,320
in Central Europe at the hands of Tarski and Łukasziewicz

77
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:38,320
and others in Poland, and Hilbert Ackermann Bernice

78
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,000
in Germany, got it again.

79
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,760
So you met Karnath in Europe in 1932,

80
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,920
and you clearly found he had a lot to offer.

81
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,280
In 1934, you gave a series of lectures

82
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,240
on his program of logical syntax.

83
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,640
Those lectures are very sympathetic to him,

84
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,480
but pretty soon you found yourself

85
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,800
having some differences with that program and with Karnath.

86
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,840
Let's know, where did you first find your differences with Karnath?

87
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,160
What were the initial difficulties you first

88
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,920
found yourself running into in thinking about executing

89
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,480
the program?

90
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,520
Yes.

91
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,360
The first occasion, apparently, and I

92
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,880
didn't learn this until just within the past few years,

93
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,240
was as far back as March 1933, when I was there with Karnath

94
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,760
and was getting so much stimulation and knowledge

95
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,760
of philosophy from him.

96
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,480
I didn't know that until it was turned up by Neil Tennant

97
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:48,160
and a log that Karnath had kept in his methodical way,

98
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:57,640
where day after day in Prague, when he wasn't going into lecture,

99
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:04,760
I would go out to where he lived and we would discuss,

100
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,600
because I was reading his logical syntax of language

101
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,080
in the German edition.

102
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,760
As it came out of the typewriter, it hadn't yet appeared.

103
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,080
It wasn't to appear for another year.

104
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,600
Karnath entered in this log that I had expressed questions

105
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:27,720
about the analyticity, some doubt about it.

106
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,040
And his reflection was that perhaps I

107
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:34,400
was right in thinking, I'm not sure how accurately I

108
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,760
remember this three or four line passage,

109
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,000
but perhaps I was right in thinking

110
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:50,200
that it was a matter of degree, until this recent archaeological

111
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,560
discovery.

112
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,400
I thought of 1935, when I was writing Truth by Convention,

113
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:04,000
that came out in 36 for a festrift for Whitehead,

114
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,120
as being my first manifestation, certainly, of that doubt.

115
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:24,440
And certainly by 39, 40, it had become really quite a firm doubt

116
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,040
and not just a tentative misgivings.

117
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:37,440
I'd like to ask you about your attitude towards the positivist

118
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:43,520
doctrine that metaphysics is meaningless in discussing

119
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,000
the so-called inverted spectrum hypothesis,

120
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,960
a hypothesis that, for all I know,

121
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,000
other people are seeing red things the way

122
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,840
I see green things in vice versa.

123
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,000
In reaction to that, you said you thought

124
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,240
this hypothesis would be unverifiable and therefore

125
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,720
meaningless.

126
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,680
And this sounds exactly the sort of thing

127
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,600
that the hard-line positivist would have said.

128
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,800
Does this show that you are, in fact,

129
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,600
a hard-line positivist in this respect?

130
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,280
No, I can agree.

131
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,400
This is exactly what the hard-line positivist would have said.

132
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:25,520
I wouldn't say it or I wouldn't mean that anyway.

133
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,880
What I perhaps said, perhaps I started

134
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,920
out saying that for one thing, it's unverifiable.

135
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,160
And then I should have gone on to say, whether I did or not,

136
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:42,440
that I can't even see how, by connecting it up

137
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:47,000
with other hypotheses, getting it into the network

138
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,680
of the web of belief, that it would link up indirectly

139
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:59,200
with verification, that it seemed to be simply inaccessible

140
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:05,040
to scientific developments that we can project,

141
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,240
that we can imagine and foresee.

142
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,000
And that, it seems to me, should qualify something

143
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,600
that purports to be a statement or a question of fact

144
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,920
as meaningless in the positivist way.

145
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,800
So you do countenance, then, a class

146
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:34,400
of meaningless, unverifiable, metaphysical sentences.

147
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,880
Yes, yes.

148
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:43,200
But it's way out, as I think it feels this is,

149
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:51,880
because I don't even consider it necessary for meaningfulness.

150
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:56,160
That a sentence be indirectly connectable

151
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:03,960
with observation, that it be part of a network.

152
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,440
I wouldn't require that the sentence be indirectly

153
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,120
verifiable in this sense.

154
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:16,120
That there be a set of sentences which together have

155
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,680
what I've called critical mass.

156
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:25,720
And that they together will imply an observationally

157
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:32,600
testable situation and would include the sentence

158
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,560
in question and would lose its critical mass

159
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,760
if, when that was removed from the class,

160
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:44,040
that would be a way of explaining what it would mean,

161
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:48,160
perhaps for a sentence to have empirical content at all

162
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:53,640
that would share empirical content in this essential way.

163
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,400
I wouldn't insist on that by any means.

164
00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:00,440
And I don't think that the bulk of sentences in history

165
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,480
or perhaps in various social sciences,

166
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:09,920
nor perhaps all of them even in serious rigorous physics

167
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,320
meet even that test.

168
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,400
And I don't think that for that reason,

169
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,680
they should be rejected as meaningless.

170
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:27,360
Because they are sentences that we have postulated or accepted.

171
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,240
That is, we've conjectured them, accepted them,

172
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,800
because they seem to fit in so nicely

173
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,800
with the theory that is working.

174
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,600
Perhaps considerations of symmetry,

175
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:43,320
perhaps it seems to fill a nice little conceptual gap.

176
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,560
And I think that furthermore, they

177
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,200
can be vital to the progress of science,

178
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:55,720
because they are, I imagine, a very important, maybe

179
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:01,640
overwhelmingly large part of the heuristics

180
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:07,480
of the fashioning of worthwhile scientific hypotheses.

181
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,400
That is to say, hypotheses that are worth testing,

182
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,080
rather than desperately erring away one's time

183
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:17,760
on hypotheses that we ought to have thought

184
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,000
were very unlikely to come out right when tested.

185
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,760
So I think that's a vital part of science.

186
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,400
And in fact, it's because of, including all these,

187
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:36,800
that I can't envision any sharp demarcation.

188
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:43,280
I'm with Carl Popper in this, between science and metaphysics

189
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:48,280
in the in the primitive sense.

190
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,480
That does raise a question, though.

191
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,800
The positivists were very fond of demarcation criteria,

192
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,640
not just to separate science from metaphysics,

193
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,120
but also to separate science from pseudoscience.

194
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,520
So the question is, how would you handle a question in which

195
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,480
someone might want to bring into question something,

196
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,560
for example, like psychoanalytic theory,

197
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,000
as to whether that really had scientific status or not.

198
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,720
The positivists would handle such a question

199
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,840
by their general criteria.

200
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,160
How would you handle such a question?

201
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,480
Yes, well, I think the effect that that consideration has on me

202
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:32,480
is rather that I'm very suspicious of it and dubious of it.

203
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,960
I can conceive that it might be helpful in some of the suggestions,

204
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,200
some of the things, perhaps some of the things that are said

205
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:43,000
about dreams or some of the things that are said about inhibitions

206
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,920
from earlier experiences, this way,

207
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:53,320
that can inspire somebody with a more scientific temper

208
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,400
to some constructive ideas that will go on.

209
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,920
Maybe it's already happened.

210
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,880
But the sort of culture is developed

211
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:09,640
and the trust that's been put into it as something therapeutic

212
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:15,200
and worth spending an awful lot of time and money treating oneself

213
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,840
to, that makes the thing certainly a great evil.

214
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,600
And I'm not sympathetic with it at all.

215
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:29,520
But I think to this extent, it's more nearly continuous

216
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:36,040
with science than it should be for me to be single-mindedly

217
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,440
inclined to brand it as meaningless.

218
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:46,080
The critics of verificationism used to devise sentences

219
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,960
which were apparently meaningful but which were cooked up in such a way

220
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,080
as not to be susceptible of empirical confirmation

221
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,240
or falsification either.

222
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,200
I seem to recall some sentence along the lines

223
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,640
of there's a planet for whose existence

224
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,080
we shall never have any evidence.

225
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,000
Would you want to say the same about those sentences

226
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,280
as you say about sentences in the outer reaches of mathematics,

227
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:15,160
which is that overall simplicity can be our only guide?

228
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:19,600
No, I think the situation isn't as clear with those sentences

229
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,760
because those sentences might be related in the way

230
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:33,560
that I was sketching through these various systematic kinships

231
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,760
to such sentences so as to be valuable in the theory

232
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:43,080
that they're fitting into the web of belief in such a way

233
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:49,440
as to seem very likely to belong.

234
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:56,160
Well, in a way, those sentences of higher mathematics

235
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,520
have that too in one direction, namely they are results

236
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:05,040
of simply continuing to apply and extrapolate the grammar

237
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:09,480
and lexicon that we've been needing for scientific purposes.

238
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:17,440
And that's a very clear and unconjectural link that they have.

239
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,640
And it's the only reason, my only reason,

240
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,760
for taking them seriously as a part of science.

241
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,360
So I think a detailed structural connection is different.

242
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:36,040
What about the idea of taking the inverted spectrum

243
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,240
hypothesis or its negation as just being a sentence

244
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,760
in the outer reaches of phenomenology, where once again

245
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,040
we'd say, well, we are allowed to be meaningful

246
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,520
because it's just using over again vocabulary

247
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,040
that we use in more workaday circumstances.

248
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,480
And we'll once again just let the truth value fall where it may

249
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,560
in light of overall simplicity, I guess,

250
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,160
in which case you'd go for the denial

251
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,440
of the inverted spectrum hypothesis.

252
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,960
Yes, well, that's an interesting suggestion

253
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,800
because I was about to wonder, all right,

254
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,560
if we admit it, which way is our decision going to go on?

255
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,320
That's truth value.

256
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,960
People wonder about the outer reaches of mathematics as well.

257
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,840
Well, there we can settle for simplicity.

258
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:29,240
I can't see simplicity coming into the act, in this case,

259
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,440
which is a commentary also on how independent it

260
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,120
seems to be from anything scientific.

261
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,440
I wonder if you recognize a class of sentences

262
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,480
that are meaningless in a more definitive way

263
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,400
than simply not seeming to have any empirical consequences

264
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,080
or the possibility of any fitting into the web of belief.

265
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,880
I have in mind Wittgenstein's example.

266
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,760
It is five o'clock on the sun.

267
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,240
Oh, good.

268
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:04,920
Where it looks as though, although grammatically OK,

269
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,160
how one feels like saying, well, five o'clock

270
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,640
hasn't been defined for the sun.

271
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,160
It doesn't make any sense to us,

272
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,600
whether it's five o'clock on the sun.

273
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,240
What's your reaction to kind of set?

274
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,640
Well, a characteristic of this kind of example, I suppose,

275
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:32,680
is that we can prove on the basis of principles

276
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:37,000
that we all, unhesitatingly, accept anyway, I should think,

277
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:46,880
that there couldn't be any criterion or any criterion

278
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:52,200
that would fit in usefully with the rest of science

279
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,880
in which those same terms are used.

280
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,720
Maybe it's just the virtue of this.

281
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,680
If it is a virtue, it's a clear case.

282
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,160
I see.

283
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:08,760
We've been talking about some of the historical influences

284
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:13,920
on you, just about Karnap, who does seem to have been predominant.

285
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,600
But there was one very centrally influential book

286
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,440
on all of the philosophers of the inner circle, not just Karnap.

287
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,360
And that was Wittgenstein's Tractatus.

288
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,240
They all read it quite numerous times,

289
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,880
and it clearly impacted all of their work.

290
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:33,200
Did it have any direct effects on you and in your work?

291
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,840
I'm not aware of us having had any positive effect.

292
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,920
I didn't like it.

293
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,640
I read it early.

294
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,560
I can't think how early.

295
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,200
Very likely, already, when I was a graduate student there in 31,

296
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:57,600
32, although not in the course, no, I didn't like it.

297
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,920
I didn't like the absoluteness of his atomism.

298
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:10,240
Also, of course, I was put off somewhat

299
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:17,600
by his being so blithe about construing quantification

300
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,320
as just the infinite case of truth functions.

301
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,200
The analogy is important, but I guess I

302
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:30,080
may have felt at the time any way that he wasn't taking

303
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:35,040
the difficulties of actually acting on this

304
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,080
into consideration.

305
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,200
Wasn't appreciating.

306
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,200
Also, it seemed to me that his treatment of number

307
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:49,640
in terms of relations was untidy.

308
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,800
And I couldn't see why it wasn't clearly so inferior

309
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,960
to the much simpler definition of number

310
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:03,280
that Russell had already given, which followed Frege.

311
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,880
So it was a bit much later work that I found more sympathetic.

312
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:18,200
The two dogmas that you reject in your article,

313
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:25,600
two dogmas of empiricism, are the analytic, synthetic

314
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,360
distinction, the distinction between matters of statements

315
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,600
that are true in virtue of their meanings alone,

316
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,280
statements that are true in virtue of the facts,

317
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,000
and the other dogma is reductionism,

318
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,400
the idea that every meaningful sentence

319
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,760
has its own empirical content can

320
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,920
be reduced to observational facts in one way or another.

321
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,600
I wanted to ask you about the relationship

322
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:59,600
between your criticisms of these two doctrines.

323
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:07,680
In particular, does your critique, your rejection

324
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,480
of the analytic, synthetic distinction

325
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,320
play any role in the line of thought

326
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,640
that takes you from the denial of reductionism

327
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,560
to the web of belief, to your renunciation

328
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,880
of a priori knowledge?

329
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:38,840
My wholism was already present in two dogmas.

330
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:47,400
In fact, in the two dogmas where everybody reads it,

331
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,280
there's a footnote to duem.

332
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:58,520
Actually, that footnote is misleading in that I didn't

333
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,440
know anything about duem when I presented two dogmas

334
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:07,360
as a lecture or when it first appeared as an article in January

335
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,880
1951.

336
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:15,080
And it was Peter Hemphill, that is, Carl G. Hemphill,

337
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:20,560
and also independently, Philip Franck,

338
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:29,520
who, having read that article, said how yes, that's like duem.

339
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,480
And so I added that footnote when the thing was reprinted

340
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,640
in from a logical point of view by way of giving duem credit.

341
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,480
It seemed to be claiming this as something, some novel

342
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,640
contributions, just a matter of presenting it

343
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,120
as being the way things are.

344
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,760
Anyway, so I had come to that somehow.

345
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:59,280
And it's hard to say, it's not a very clean cut idea,

346
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,640
somewhere along the line from Truth by Convention

347
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,080
to Two Dogmas.

348
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,920
And then, the Web of Belief, well,

349
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:13,240
that was a very, I think, an admirable and catchy title

350
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,880
due to my collaborator, Joe Ullian.

351
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,360
But that's just more of the same.

352
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:29,160
When I was writing Two Dogmas, I brought that in.

353
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:34,480
And structurally, its position in that article

354
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,920
is, as one possible consideration to help account

355
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:43,920
for the rather strange fact that people take analyticity,

356
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,320
even analyticity across the board the way they do,

357
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:53,760
so uncritically, that there may be a failure to appreciate

358
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,040
that reductionism won't do.

359
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,680
Fail to appreciate wholism.

360
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:09,440
As for whether it was this wholistic view that

361
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:15,200
made me skeptical of analyticity in the first place,

362
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:20,320
I just can't judge, because something

363
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,840
like an appreciation of that can be

364
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:28,840
vague and inarticulate enough so that it

365
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,440
doesn't come out explicitly.

366
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,760
And I had thought of it as such.

367
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:38,960
It's the same, the two attitudes, the wholism,

368
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,360
therefore, anti-reductionism in that particular instance

369
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,240
of reduction.

370
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,000
And the skepticism about meaning and analyticity

371
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,600
are so much of a piece.

372
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,440
Incidentally, that anti-reductionism

373
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,640
has certainly caused misunderstandings,

374
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,920
because I am not against reductionism as such,

375
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,840
for heaven's sake.

376
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,680
I'm very fond of it.

377
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,720
More reduction, the better.

378
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,560
And it's just this particular case of it.

379
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:23,640
Could your line of thought, which involves rejecting

380
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:28,600
the reductionism in this epistemological form,

381
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,120
the reduction of any theoretical statement

382
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,240
to observation statements, which goes from there

383
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:39,520
to wholism and the web of belief and the rejection

384
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,520
of a priori knowledge, could that

385
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:49,280
proceed independently of any critique of analyticity?

386
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,680
They're so closely mentioned, it's hard to say.

387
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:59,960
But I think just because of the developing situation,

388
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:07,640
the circumstances when these questions arose,

389
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:16,040
it was certainly what I became clearly aware of was

390
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,520
misgivings specifically over analyticity.

391
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:22,480
That was because of the way Carnot was using it.

392
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,480
But I thought of it, then, as an objection that,

393
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,960
and still in two dogmas, I thought of it,

394
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:35,480
as a matter of not having given a satisfactory definition

395
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,400
of his terms, of his term analyticity.

396
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,120
But the difficulty of doing so, then,

397
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:50,320
is of a piece with the wholism.

398
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,800
If he had managed to, or if someone

399
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,600
had managed to give it a characterization of analyticity

400
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:01,360
from which it would not follow that an analytic truth could

401
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,440
be known a priori, then would that

402
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,840
conception of analyticity have been

403
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:13,240
able to play the philosophical role that it

404
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:18,640
was being asked to play prior to two dogmas?

405
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,080
I think it's something like the definition of analyticity

406
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,800
that I propose in roots of reference.

407
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,560
For example, yes.

408
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:31,880
No, that's certainly unscathed.

409
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,880
Just going back to two dogmas for a moment,

410
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,200
Freddie Ayer cited you as being responsible,

411
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,440
or partly responsible, for the dismantling

412
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,080
of logical positivism because of your attack,

413
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,920
your twin attacks on the analytic synthetic distinction

414
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,360
and reductionism in that paper.

415
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:54,640
And we've spoken privately a bit about Freddie Ayer

416
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,400
and his position at that time when you met him,

417
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,680
and subsequently, as you observed

418
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,680
his philosophical connection to logical positivism

419
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,560
and how it differed from your own.

420
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,880
And you've expressed a willingness

421
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,600
to say something about this.

422
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,320
So would you tell us about that?

423
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:18,600
Well, it seemed to me in his influential first book,

424
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:26,240
Language, Truth, and Logic, he came out, interestingly,

425
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,880
in between the two phases of Carnop

426
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:34,920
that it seemed to me so abruptly different.

427
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,880
The Carnop of the logisher Aufbau,

428
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:41,520
where he was very much the phenomenalist,

429
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:48,080
and the later Carnop, where he's a, well,

430
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:59,000
I'd say he's taken on naturalism along more specifically

431
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,760
with his physicalism.

432
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:07,520
In fact, it eases the transition from the earlier

433
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,840
Carnop to the later one and makes it more intelligible.

434
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:17,240
I can't see quite how to pin it down

435
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,720
in the way of specific points.

436
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,400
The book was impressive to me.

437
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:33,080
The way so much in philosophy came under his criticism.

438
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,800
The book, from beginning to end, focuses primarily

439
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,720
on meaninglessness of metaphysics,

440
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,360
and one metaphysical, one philosophical,

441
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,880
traditional philosophical question,

442
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,480
or issue after another is taken up,

443
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:53,880
and then he argues, shows how it is hopelessly

444
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,160
unempirical and how it goes.

445
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:00,480
And this is leading up, directs it well,

446
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:09,600
and so this makes for a close continuity, again,

447
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,920
between the Vienna circle of the later Carnop

448
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:18,480
and the Wittgenstein of his days in England,

449
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,360
where philosophy becomes, under Wittgenstein,

450
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:27,640
a straight therapeutic undertaking,

451
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:32,120
and philosophical problems are results

452
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,880
of misuse of language that can be cured.

453
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:42,520
And the point pointing out of just the way

454
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:49,120
that air felt that language had gone wrong in these cases,

455
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,960
sometimes is the way he handles the questions

456
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,720
and showing them, showing that they're meaningless.

457
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,960
And he certainly produced something

458
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:02,760
that gives the spirit of the Vienna circle

459
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,440
for the reader who runs.

460
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:12,280
It's not intellectually exacting.

461
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:20,200
It can be read and depreciated by wide circle and was.

462
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:29,760
Very important point of view of the history

463
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:34,280
and geography of philosophy.

464
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,160
You've said that naturalism is one

465
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,840
of the main components of your philosophy.

466
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,080
That's the view, roughly speaking,

467
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:48,280
that science is the only road to genuine knowledge.

468
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,800
I'd like to ask you about this.

469
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:54,360
Do you think that this naturalist doctrine

470
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,400
can be established or in any way justified,

471
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,600
or does it have to be a basic axiom?

472
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:11,800
Well, no.

473
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,640
I think perhaps the avenue has to be something like this,

474
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:20,000
that you're engaged in science and have recognized

475
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:27,080
what implicitly or explicitly that the checkpoints

476
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,320
of science, insofar as they exist,

477
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:33,920
are checkpoints in observation through that channel

478
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:37,880
of applying the observational setup.

479
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:48,120
And you appreciate that without considering

480
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:51,040
that what doesn't submit to that test is meaningless.

481
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,520
Of course, I've just been arguing against that point of view.

482
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,880
But insofar as there is a check, that's what it is.

483
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:03,120
And so this would make one critical of the transcendental

484
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:08,480
intrusions, as if there were other sources,

485
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:18,080
either in a priori knowledge of the human or divine revelation

486
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:24,120
as a support underpinning for science and its method.

487
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:32,960
But I feel that naturalism is and was very widespread.

488
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,000
Nothing new about this.

489
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:41,560
I adopted the term, introduced, I don't know which,

490
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:46,200
naturalistic epistemology or epistemology naturalized

491
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,880
for a specific application, namely,

492
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:54,520
getting away from the notion of a phenomenalistic reduction

493
00:35:54,520 --> 00:36:01,320
of scientific concepts in order to endow them with meaning

494
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:06,440
in favor of going at those questions from within,

495
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,200
from within science itself.

496
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:13,520
And this is certainly quite a clear and undistakeable

497
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:19,440
contrast between my way of doing things and Carnop's

498
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,520
Aufbau to take extreme case.

499
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,080
But on the other hand, naturalistic philosophy,

500
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,240
generally, it seems to me, Hume was completely a naturalist.

501
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,320
It says that Hume didn't carry out reductions.

502
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:42,000
And if he did carry them out, well,

503
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,400
maybe he would have tried the same kind of thing that Carnop

504
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,320
would have tried if he had had the same apparatus

505
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,560
in the way of logic.

506
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:58,000
And it seems to me most, as far as I know them,

507
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,440
traditional philosophers were.

508
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,320
But then there are these intrusions

509
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,680
of in one philosopher after another, of course,

510
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:15,080
partly with his divine intervention.

511
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:18,120
But if one philosopher such as himself

512
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:22,840
say that science is the only road to genuine knowledge,

513
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:26,360
naturalism is correct, another philosopher says,

514
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,200
I disagree.

515
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,800
I don't think that naturalism is correct.

516
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,920
Is there any way to settle the dispute?

517
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,160
Well, perhaps there's not.

518
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:46,840
Because it would seem that the other philosopher in this case

519
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:59,040
was not satisfied with empirical evidence

520
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,480
or was prepared rather to, I suppose

521
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,920
I should put the other way around,

522
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:13,640
that he was prepared to welcome the kind of evidence

523
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:19,840
that I couldn't admit because it doesn't persuade me,

524
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,960
because the kind of thing that would persuade me

525
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:26,960
would be at least the illusion of empirical evidence

526
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,040
in observation.

527
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,120
So that he's got something which I suspect

528
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,840
is just wrong turning and nonsense.

529
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,840
But in any event, of course, that's

530
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:43,440
taking a partisan position in this particular confrontation.

531
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:52,760
But to take a symmetrical approach here,

532
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:58,600
it would just be that inability on my part

533
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:04,520
to appreciate what he's counting as evidence is wrong.

534
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,080
You've distinguished between your naturalism

535
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,200
and your empiricism.

536
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,800
No.

537
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,800
No.

538
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,680
I thought that your empiricism, you

539
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:18,800
have taken to be itself an empirical doctrine which

540
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,680
flows out of your naturalism.

541
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,200
It's your naturalism which leads you to empiricism,

542
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,960
which leads you to the view that the checkpoints should

543
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,680
be observable data, but you could imagine it's

544
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:36,800
turning out that other sorts of data

545
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,320
should be taken into account.

546
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,520
Well, I don't think I can.

547
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,600
But I'm not getting the distinction between naturalism

548
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,040
and empiricism.

549
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:52,320
When, as I was explaining, my reason

550
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,760
for introducing that phrase, epistemology naturalized,

551
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,240
that was specifically for contrast

552
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:07,360
with Carnop's building up and the traditional epistemologist

553
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:07,960
before Carnop.

554
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,600
But Carnop was the one who came closest to actually building

555
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,520
it up.

556
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:17,160
Building up a phenomenal language in which science

557
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,440
was not expressed, and then getting a language

558
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:25,240
about the natural world, the physical world from that.

559
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:30,080
And I'm taking the other specifically, the other approach

560
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:35,600
and going into it from the standpoint

561
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,400
of the physical world.

562
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,440
They already accepted ontology itself.

563
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,200
As far as I can see, the alternative that you're

564
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:59,400
picturing would just be the sort of thing

565
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:04,920
that I'm picturing, someone who is claiming

566
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:10,200
a kind of mystical, or to me anyway,

567
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:16,640
mysterious, source of evidence or kind of evidence

568
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,920
that I can't appreciate and that doesn't move me.

569
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,840
And it might be a mystical, in some extreme case,

570
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:29,440
a mystical insight on the part of some guru in the Himalayas.

571
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,440
I think it's in pursuit of truth.

572
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:36,640
You say that empiricism is itself an empirical doctrine

573
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,360
as part of the web of belief, and might have to be abandoned.

574
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,920
If it turned out, for example, that there was much more

575
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:50,160
to clairvoyance or telepathy than we presently think,

576
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,240
we would be led away from the view

577
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,480
that the only reasonable checkpoints for scientific theory

578
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,520
are observable data, and we have to accept

579
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,840
some other checkpoints.

580
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,320
Oh, good.

581
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:03,920
Maybe we'd even have to accept divine revelation.

582
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,720
Good.

583
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,360
Yeah.

584
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,040
So let's see where this leaves us.

585
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,440
I do think it's an empirical doctrine,

586
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,320
I mean a scientific doctrine coming out of science,

587
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,680
in that science tells us there are only

588
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,720
avenue of evidences through our senses

589
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:29,200
by the impact of physical objects and forces.

590
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:37,960
And furthermore, that we might get evidence to the contrary,

591
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,600
and it would be still evidence of the kind that does count for me,

592
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,160
because it would be observable evidence.

593
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:50,160
And I can well imagine evidence for clairvoyance

594
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:56,480
just in the prediction of observable events, where

595
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:01,240
I couldn't see what empirical basis, in terms of known

596
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:05,920
scientific forces, could have brought this about.

597
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:11,480
And that would entail a revision not only of empiricism.

598
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,680
Well, would it?

599
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:21,600
Maybe we're getting a bifurcation here.

600
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:26,760
What about that?

601
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,800
It makes me wonder whether perhaps there's

602
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:44,840
some difficulty in empiricism on the, yes,

603
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,080
I think this is the trouble.

604
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:55,920
Perhaps we should say that empiricism goes on,

605
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:00,840
because I'm still settling only for corroboration

606
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:03,840
in the observations.

607
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:07,680
Yes, good, good.

608
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:12,280
But what goes by the board is the doctrine

609
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:17,640
that the input is just through the senses, at least

610
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,920
through the senses that we've so thus far enumerated.

611
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,680
And good.

612
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:30,880
Well, I think the moral of this, this

613
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:38,760
may be to have second thoughts about the statement

614
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:43,440
that empiricism is a scientific result.

615
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,720
Yes, that's good.

616
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:48,440
That's interesting.

617
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:58,120
Perhaps you've already answered this question

618
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,320
and what you just said.

619
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:04,160
But I wanted to ask you about which prominent philosophers

620
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:10,120
in the 20th century you would say are clearly not

621
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,560
sympathetic to naturalism.

622
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:15,320
Don't endorse naturalism, as you see it.

623
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,280
Well, I wonder.

624
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:23,040
Certainly the ordinary language philosophers of England

625
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,320
are naturalistic, as one could wish.

626
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:29,720
It's the other extreme, whatever philosophers

627
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:36,080
there are who are religious apologists,

628
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:45,320
trying still to support notions of revelation

629
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,000
would be an example to the contrary.

630
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,440
Those are clear cases, both ends, I'd say.

631
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,240
And then in between, what I would think of

632
00:45:54,240 --> 00:46:01,960
is just the philosophers who are still

633
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,000
reluctant, even though not coming through

634
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,840
with epistemological reductions of the kind that

635
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:12,280
current up in the off-bau is undertaking.

636
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:15,720
Something that's never been taken up so far as I know

637
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:19,080
and pursued any further or could be.

638
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:26,520
But still are dissatisfied with the naturalization

639
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:29,400
of epistemology, in that they apparently still

640
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,560
feel that there's a problem there.

641
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:37,240
And this would be a negative kind still of non-naturalism.

642
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:43,200
There's a question about where naturalism leaves one

643
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,960
with respect to the issue of what is philosophy.

644
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:53,760
One possibility that you have endorsed

645
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:58,160
is that we think of philosophy as part of natural science.

646
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,480
There are other possibilities.

647
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,880
One might think that philosophy is simply

648
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:09,400
discredited as a possible enterprise.

649
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:14,280
Or one might think that philosophy, perhaps

650
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,680
with Wittgenstein, the philosophy

651
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,200
doesn't really aim at knowledge,

652
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,600
but as a therapeutic endeavor.

653
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,480
Is there any particular reason for picking

654
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,800
your characterization of philosophy?

655
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:32,040
No, that's not the characterization I intend.

656
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:34,040
I may occasionally say things that

657
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:38,160
sound very much like that, or even exactly like that.

658
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:42,920
But what I mean is philosophy is continuous with science.

659
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:45,560
My philosophy is continuous with science.

660
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,560
I can say that because that follows

661
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,120
from the fact that my philosophy, at least,

662
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,760
is continuous with science and it's part of philosophy.

663
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,960
And it may still be that, and I think it is,

664
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,120
that my philosophy is more continuous with science

665
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:02,720
than it is with some other parts of philosophy.

666
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:07,000
And I don't think of this sort of thing,

667
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,320
the scientific sort of philosophy,

668
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,320
as being the whole of philosophy.

669
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,840
There are other parts of philosophy, even, that I respect.

670
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,080
Ethics.

671
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,840
And of course, my position is that

672
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:22,840
judgments of moral value, and likewise aesthetic value,

673
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:29,520
are not part of science, except the anthropology

674
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:30,880
behind them is.

675
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,400
So I think a philosophy is quite a

676
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:44,680
quite a scattered, quite an aggregate whole.

677
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:51,040
And I should add, I think of furthermore,

678
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:55,720
even rather sympathetically, of English ordinary

679
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:59,040
language philosophy as being philosophy.

680
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,160
It's just that it's not enough of it.

681
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:09,040
I wanted to ask a question about Peter Strossen's paper,

682
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:12,520
two conceptions of philosophy and the contrast

683
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:15,480
between his naturalism and your naturalism.

684
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,920
In that paper, Strossen says,

685
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,680
what's this alternative conception?

686
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,560
In other words, what's his conception of philosophy?

687
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:26,200
Well, he says, the common as distinct

688
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:29,440
from the scientific understanding is a complicated affair,

689
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,800
embracing an indefinitely large range of ideas or concepts.

690
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:38,120
He gives a long list of concepts and then says,

691
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:40,080
the philosophical aim of those who adhere

692
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,040
to my alternative conception of philosophy,

693
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:45,360
I take to be that of elucidating the character

694
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:49,200
of such concepts as these and their interconnections.

695
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,760
What do you make of this alternative conception

696
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:55,480
of philosophy and how does it differ from yours?

697
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,560
It's narrower.

698
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:00,880
Yes, I would count this as decidedly as philosophy.

699
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,360
And in fact, it seems to me it's the,

700
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,440
well, it's of a piece

701
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,880
with the English Ordinary Language Philosophy.

702
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,000
These concepts, you list,

703
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,440
aren't very ordinary language, of course,

704
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:19,000
but on the other hand, they're also not symbolic logic.

705
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,560
And it's of a piece with that.

706
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,280
And I think it's all philosophy.

707
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:28,280
And it's even a lot, I think it's useful.

708
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:33,280
I think it probably turns out to be very largely true even.

709
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,560
But I wouldn't limit it to that

710
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:42,280
because I think there are,

711
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:47,080
well, a lot more that goes on that interests me

712
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,640
in my part of philosophy that doesn't come under that head,

713
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,720
not analysis of concepts.

714
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:58,000
But, well, naturalized epistemology

715
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:58,880
is one thing.

716
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:06,000
And then all such ventures are fruitful or not as

717
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,840
trying to get a more economical ontology

718
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:27,800
such contortions as getting a better understanding

719
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,120
of bodies identified with portions of space-time

720
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,680
and then portions of space-time in turn

721
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:38,680
with the classes of quadruples of numbers.

722
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,560
That's, I think, inside the philosophy.

723
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:47,560
And it's not analysis of concepts.

724
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,240
Doesn't seem in quite the same sense, anyway.

725
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,560
It's the kind of thing that would be regarded

726
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:56,000
as further extension in an unaccustomed direction

727
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,280
of natural science.

728
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:02,240
One of the things that Strossen stresses

729
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,880
is the interconnections between concepts.

730
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,800
And sometimes he speaks of this in terms of

731
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,280
plotting the contours of a conceptual scheme.

732
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,440
Part of what this involves is not just listing

733
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,120
a whole lot of things that we do,

734
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:18,440
but trying to identify, in some sense,

735
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:21,440
though not, I think, a scientific sense, particularly,

736
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:22,840
what's basic about what we do.

737
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,560
And so, for example, Strossen says

738
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:27,040
that material bodies are basic particulars,

739
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,800
not in the sense that they're basic for science,

740
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,680
but in the sense that identification

741
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,400
of material bodies, he says, is basic.

742
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,800
Identification of other kinds of objects

743
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,680
depends upon identification of material bodies

744
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:40,840
and not conversely.

745
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,240
So he argues.

746
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,080
Do you think there's any good prospect

747
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:47,240
for theoretical results of this kind in philosophy?

748
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:50,080
Yes, this does sound good to me.

749
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:56,080
And it's interesting, in particular,

750
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:02,360
perhaps as an extension,

751
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:05,360
and what seems to be an increasingly serious extension

752
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:07,680
of ordinary language philosophy,

753
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,480
where what is really coming into consideration

754
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:14,040
is the structure of ordinary language,

755
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:19,040
and not the structure in the linguist sense,

756
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:24,040
but the conceptual structure of our whole ordinary

757
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,360
and even extra ordinary, even scientific,

758
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:29,720
conception of the world.

759
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:35,800
And again, very much a part of what I regard

760
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,040
as philosophy and useful,

761
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:45,720
and as conspicuously continuous with science.

762
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:47,960
Paul asked earlier about

763
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:50,600
whether naturalism could be justified,

764
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:53,400
perhaps within the naturalist camp.

765
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,920
There are these different projects.

766
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,920
I wonder how one or other of those

767
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,760
might be chosen ahead of the other.

768
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:01,480
Strossen himself says of the two conceptions,

769
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:04,440
each has its own worth, he says, and its own appeal.

770
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:05,960
The choice between them is ultimately,

771
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:08,920
perhaps, a matter of individual temperament.

772
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,120
Do you think that's right?

773
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:15,120
The choice of them for what?

774
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,760
One can very well choose music instead of,

775
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:28,760
without casting aspersions on philosophy,

776
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,560
you can choose music instead,

777
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:36,340
and one can do fiction instead of science.

778
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:42,340
I think of the insistence on observation

779
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:48,700
as the checkpoint, insofar as any checkpoint can be,

780
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:57,900
can exist for what deserves the name of science.

781
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:03,060
And although a great deal of what deserves

782
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:06,980
the name of science can't be checked,

783
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:09,980
directly or indirectly, I claim,

784
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:14,060
still, when it is checked, it's going to be checked that way.

785
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:20,060
And I think of this not as something to establish,

786
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:25,820
but what distinguishes that scientific endeavor.

787
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:27,780
Now, how would anybody want to do that?

788
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:33,660
There, of course, there are two frequent reasons.

789
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:40,020
One is technology, and the other is

790
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:43,620
just intellectual curiosity.

791
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:46,460
I suppose the question, partly,

792
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:50,260
is how large a role science is going to play

793
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:52,380
in one's intellectual life.

794
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:56,300
Strawson, in effect, takes up the question

795
00:55:56,340 --> 00:56:00,260
that you've just asked, the question, for what?

796
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:02,860
And he says, for one content to lead his life,

797
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,580
at least his intellectual life,

798
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:06,620
in the rarefied atmosphere of science,

799
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:09,500
the choice on this test will go one way.

800
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:12,660
For one content to lead his intellectual life

801
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:16,140
in the muddier atmosphere of the more mundane,

802
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:17,380
it will go the other way.

803
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,700
Does that seem to you to be the key,

804
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:22,740
whether one has a taste for the rarefied

805
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:24,940
or a taste for the muddier?

806
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:27,140
Well, I'm wondering just what the other way is,

807
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:28,700
in this case, what he has in mind.

808
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:31,260
He just had in mind what he calls

809
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:35,660
the more liberal or Catholic conception of philosophy.

810
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:38,820
Well, I think maybe he's a shift

811
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:41,260
to a more liberal or Catholic conception of science,

812
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:44,420
and he wouldn't find the discrepancy.

813
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:48,900
Made it sound as if naturalism consisted

814
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:53,780
in your being prepared to call science

815
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:57,460
the only things that were subject

816
00:56:57,460 --> 00:57:00,020
to the checkpoint of observation.

817
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:04,260
And that makes the doctrine sound somewhat terminological.

818
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:07,180
So it makes the doctrine sound as if it's just about

819
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:08,820
what you are going to call science,

820
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:10,420
and what you are not going to call science,

821
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:13,580
and who cares about terminology.

822
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:18,060
No, I don't think that is a naturalistic position.

823
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:19,220
I see.

824
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:27,780
I just think of that as the distinguishing trait

825
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:34,460
of anything that any of us would think of as science

826
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:37,100
in the broadest sense, including history,

827
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:43,260
that if there is a checkpoint, it's there.

828
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:47,820
And on the other hand, I wouldn't expect one

829
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:52,060
to call something science if the checkpoints

830
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:57,060
were supernatural, the alleged checkpoints.

831
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:05,340
Do you think, is this closer to what your naturalism

832
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:10,900
consists in, that one simply ought to believe things

833
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:17,340
that haven't been subject to these things

834
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:23,820
that aren't subject to those observational checkpoints?

835
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:30,900
No, no, on the contrary, I hold that a great deal

836
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:38,100
of what's in science, the broad sense of this broad sense

837
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:42,140
has no checkpoint, direct or indirect,

838
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:47,140
and is still valuable, and valuable for science itself

839
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:49,660
and indirectly for prediction, but very indirectly,

840
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:53,500
namely as suggesting for further filling out

841
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:57,620
some more hypotheses, which, unlike those first ones,

842
00:58:57,620 --> 00:59:00,580
do link up indirectly, systematically,

843
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:05,580
with critical masses that can as whole apply observations.

844
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:13,140
And I think that science would be very severely impoverished

845
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:18,820
if the evenly, most liberal sort of positivism

846
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:24,180
were put into effect.

847
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:27,620
But all these things fit into the web of belief

848
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:30,540
in one way or another, all the things that you think

849
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:32,300
should be, could be believed.

850
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:35,580
So I don't insist on checkpoints.

851
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:38,860
All I am assisting on here is negative,

852
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:43,300
namely, no checkpoints except observation.

853
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:48,460
Where do that leave ethics?

854
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:55,080
Out of science, but in philosophy,

855
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:59,020
and in respectable philosophy.

856
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:02,300
And in what we might legitimately believe,

857
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:03,540
doctrines.

858
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:06,540
Well, in another sense of believe, yes.

859
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:11,340
It has been noted by many philosophers yourself included

860
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:13,780
that there are points of contact between your thinking

861
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:16,420
and that of American pragmatism.

862
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:19,540
explicitly mentioned, for example, in the Dewey lecture,

863
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:21,860
some agreements you have with Dewey.

864
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:25,660
To what extent was pragmatism an actual influence on you?

865
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:32,260
I think, well, it's hard to think of any.

866
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:33,340
It's hard to think of any.

867
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:35,740
And I haven't been clear of my own mind

868
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:38,300
on what constitutes pragmatism

869
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:43,300
and what separates it from epistemology, from empiricism.

870
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:48,980
I've thought about various tenets

871
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:52,500
held by various card-carrying pragmatists,

872
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:57,500
James, Dewey, Perce.

873
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:05,340
And they seem to be far enough from each other.

874
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:11,340
At least as far from one another

875
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:16,340
as any of them from some non-pragmatists,

876
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:21,340
as far as they're usually classified.

877
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:28,820
So I've never considered myself a pragmatist.

878
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:32,780
And that's where that misleading paragraph

879
01:01:32,820 --> 01:01:36,340
at the end of Two Dogs was makes all the difference.

880
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:38,780
Where I'm picking up Carnop's phrase

881
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:41,620
that he applied to his frameworks

882
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:43,340
as being purely pragmatic,

883
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:48,340
unlike the rest of science, which is empirical.

884
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:53,540
And where I say, well, yes, I agree with Carnop

885
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:58,540
about the character of what he's calling the framework.

886
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:00,940
Of what he's calling the framework,

887
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:04,380
but of course I'm questioning the difference

888
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:06,460
between the framework and the rest of science.

889
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:08,980
And I'm saying that it's just that my pragmatism

890
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:12,340
is more through or going, I would apply it across the board.

891
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:17,260
But that's, as it turned out, was an unfortunate way

892
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:21,420
of putting it, I was just using his word.

893
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:24,900
I have a post of pragmatism, it's just that I've wondered

894
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:27,060
just what is distinctive about it.

895
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:31,300
And so I've never considered myself a pragmatist.

896
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:35,620
You mentioned Carnop's notion of framework.

897
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:37,500
One difference between you and Carnop

898
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:41,100
that come over and over again in various guises in the years

899
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:43,260
is your attitude toward natural language

900
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:45,100
as opposed to constructed language.

901
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:47,860
Carnop almost never wants to deal with natural language.

902
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:52,260
He always wants to define his notions

903
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:54,460
only for constructed languages,

904
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:57,140
where you always seem to want to pull him back

905
01:02:57,140 --> 01:03:00,420
into consideration of what languages people actually speak.

906
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:03,620
Yes, yes, because I think of those constructions

907
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:08,620
as superstructures for one or another particular,

908
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:11,780
generally local, temporary purpose.

909
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:18,540
And I think of axiom or postulate as a,

910
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:23,820
in effect an indexical indicator word,

911
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:28,420
namely something relative to the particular project

912
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:31,580
of pedagogy that one's engaged in.

913
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:34,020
Here's the way he's organizing this law

914
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:37,780
that he wants the reader to master.

915
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:39,900
He's putting it in this order

916
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:42,020
and deducing these from those.

917
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:43,780
Somebody might find an even more efficient way

918
01:03:43,780 --> 01:03:45,820
of doing it the other end too,

919
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:49,240
and that there's nothing intrinsic about those things.

920
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:52,140
The artificial language,

921
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:57,100
of course, if one thinks primarily

922
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:58,340
in terms of artificial languages,

923
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:01,540
then there's no problem about analyticity,

924
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:05,240
that what's analytic is the axioms and their consequences.

925
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:10,340
So what is the point of artificial language?

926
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:13,460
Well, it depends, of course, on what it's used for,

927
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:18,460
but at one point I presented this artificial example,

928
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:30,380
a positivist, a logical positivist named Ixman.

929
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:35,340
I thought of that now.

930
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:41,340
Ixman is making some point about the meaning

931
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:43,860
of some metaphysics in which he,

932
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:51,540
some metaphysical, these things are meaningless,

933
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:56,140
and his argument is that you could have all of science

934
01:04:57,140 --> 01:04:59,180
and all of our predictions and everything

935
01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:02,140
without any of these metaphysical questions even coming in.

936
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:06,300
And to show this, at least with some examples,

937
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:09,980
he says, imagine a tribe,

938
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:16,980
a tribe of Martians who speak a language

939
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:18,380
of the following sort,

940
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:21,980
and then he sets up an artificial language.

941
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:26,980
He has to tell us a good deal about the syntax

942
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:30,420
and vocabulary, but just certain parts,

943
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:32,260
just the parts that are gonna make his point

944
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:34,380
at the point of this particular metaphysical sentence

945
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:38,660
that he's taking the props out from under.

946
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:44,860
So he lays down these particular traits of the language,

947
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:45,780
whenever these things,

948
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:47,580
there are these sentences when these are true,

949
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:52,580
these are true, and that's all he needs to make his point.

950
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:56,100
All right, there's an artificial language,

951
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:57,900
and there's a perfectly clear sense

952
01:05:57,900 --> 01:05:59,740
in which we can say what's analytic and what isn't,

953
01:05:59,740 --> 01:06:01,100
what's in the framework,

954
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:03,900
and what is empirical outside the framework,

955
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:06,020
namely what Ixman has laid down.

956
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:10,380
But what was the significance of his laying it down?

957
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:11,220
Well, in this example,

958
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:12,980
we know exactly what the significance was,

959
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:14,940
and it doesn't throw any light

960
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:17,860
on a more general notion of analytic.

961
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:20,140
And it's this sort of consideration

962
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:23,780
that has made me

963
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:31,900
empirical in my approach

964
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:36,900
or my criticism of these semantical notions.

965
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:44,660
Besides your naturalism or empiricism,

966
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:46,460
perhaps they're the same thing,

967
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:50,740
you've singled out as central doctrines of your philosophy,

968
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:55,180
what you call your extensionalism,

969
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:58,700
and also your skepticism about meaning.

970
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:01,060
Could you tell us something about what these doctrines are

971
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:03,300
and how they relate to one another?

972
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:08,300
Well, essentialism is what's involved in saying that

973
01:07:10,580 --> 01:07:15,580
classes that have the same members,

974
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:19,900
everything that's true of a class

975
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:24,900
is true of a class that has the same members as that class.

976
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:27,460
In that sense, therefore,

977
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:29,140
they are just one class, not two.

978
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:35,940
And that's extensionalism,

979
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:40,660
the core of it, that's the law of extensionality.

980
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:46,540
In an extensional language,

981
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:52,900
any two predicates are interchangeable

982
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:56,260
without, if they are true of the same objects,

983
01:07:56,260 --> 01:07:58,380
interchangeable without disturbing the truth value

984
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:00,180
of the sentence in which they occur.

985
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:06,180
So that for an extensional language,

986
01:08:07,820 --> 01:08:10,220
therefore, there's no difference

987
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:12,260
between a property and a class.

988
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:17,260
Properties are identical for such a theory,

989
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:20,580
such a language, if and only if they have the same,

990
01:08:20,580 --> 01:08:23,180
if and only if they're true of the same things.

991
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:26,220
Therefore, you might as well call them classes, and I do.

992
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:28,980
And thus, I don't recognize properties.

993
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:36,180
Well, that's really the whole of essentialism.

994
01:08:39,860 --> 01:08:44,420
But when, good Lord, I mean of extensionalism,

995
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:50,620
but an important consequence of it is

996
01:08:50,620 --> 01:08:55,620
that there's no difficulty in an extensionalist language

997
01:08:56,420 --> 01:08:58,220
or an extensional language,

998
01:08:59,140 --> 01:09:03,780
we can say, no problem about the

999
01:09:04,780 --> 01:09:06,300
substitutivity of identity.

1000
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:11,300
That is to say that if two terms are names of the same thing,

1001
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:16,700
two singular terms are names of the same thing

1002
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:21,460
and nothing else, you can put one for the other

1003
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:22,580
in any context anywhere,

1004
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:26,060
and again, the truth will be undisturbed.

1005
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:33,780
It's hard to make sense really of that law failing

1006
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:37,180
if the things really are identical.

1007
01:09:37,180 --> 01:09:42,180
But when you get away from extensional context,

1008
01:09:42,860 --> 01:09:46,980
that does seem continuously to be threatened.

1009
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:51,780
And that's one of the practical virtues

1010
01:09:52,940 --> 01:09:57,740
of trying to maintain a completely extensional theory.

1011
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:04,220
Could you explain how this extensionalist position,

1012
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:11,220
denial are any properties over and above classes?

1013
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:14,380
How that relates to your skepticism about meaning?

1014
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:17,980
It relates in this way.

1015
01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:21,780
It's not enough to warrant the skepticism,

1016
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:23,700
not in itself altogether,

1017
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:25,060
but it does relate in this way

1018
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:27,980
that pretty good that are two of the same things,

1019
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:30,220
still may or may not have the same meaning.

1020
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:38,300
So it's a, so sameness of meaning

1021
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:40,900
is a distinction that goes beyond

1022
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:46,500
sameness of extension,

1023
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:49,180
sameness of objects denoted.

1024
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:54,300
I wanted to ask about properties in the fully

1025
01:10:54,340 --> 01:10:58,460
austere ontology where we just have classes

1026
01:10:58,460 --> 01:11:01,180
of four tuples of real numbers.

1027
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:04,580
Well, there properties as traditionally conceived

1028
01:11:04,580 --> 01:11:08,060
aren't recognized, but then nor are I suppose

1029
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:11,860
tables and mountains fuzzy blurred objects

1030
01:11:11,860 --> 01:11:14,380
as normally conceived recognized.

1031
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:16,980
But still I sense that you're more sympathetic

1032
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:20,460
to tables and mountains than you are to properties.

1033
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:21,380
One of you would say why?

1034
01:11:22,220 --> 01:11:27,220
Yes, one has to settle for their fuzziness

1035
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:33,700
since all empirically learned terms are vague

1036
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:35,700
that way on their edges at least.

1037
01:11:37,780 --> 01:11:39,620
And we can't do without them.

1038
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:42,940
And the way I'm inclined to accommodate them,

1039
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:47,940
however, is by taking as my theoretical ontology

1040
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:53,460
objects that are not fuzzy.

1041
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:58,460
And it would mean that any of indefinitely many

1042
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:06,580
distinct from one another,

1043
01:12:06,580 --> 01:12:11,580
mutually distinct bodies, real bodies could be

1044
01:12:18,940 --> 01:12:21,820
identified with that table.

1045
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:27,580
It would make no difference in all applications

1046
01:12:27,580 --> 01:12:29,100
of our scientific theory.

1047
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:31,460
But from the theoretical point of view,

1048
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:33,420
we would consider ourselves to be talking about

1049
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:36,260
one of that multitude and not all of them.

1050
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:40,740
Well, as for properties, I can understand

1051
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:44,100
the antipathy to properties particularly

1052
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:47,700
if properties are seen as related to extensions

1053
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:52,220
as sense to reference using Frager's terminology

1054
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:55,260
because properties would come under the scope

1055
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:57,660
of skepticism about meaning in that case.

1056
01:12:57,660 --> 01:12:59,580
What about the alternative conception of properties

1057
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:01,060
where properties are thought of as lying

1058
01:13:01,060 --> 01:13:05,220
in between a fragrance sense and extension?

1059
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:10,860
How do you feel about admitting those to your ontology?

1060
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:12,020
No, I'm against it.

1061
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:15,180
My objection is again,

1062
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:19,660
I'm just over the principle of individuation,

1063
01:13:19,660 --> 01:13:24,660
of what I would want would be an explanation of clear one,

1064
01:13:27,260 --> 01:13:32,260
of just when to say of property A and property B

1065
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:35,380
in that sense that they're the same property.

1066
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:39,060
And you're skeptical about that.

1067
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:40,300
I don't know any way to do it.

1068
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:45,620
I'm supposing the scientists were more certain

1069
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:49,500
that they needed properties than they were of any account

1070
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:51,220
they could offer you just now

1071
01:13:51,220 --> 01:13:53,980
of the individuation conditions for properties.

1072
01:13:53,980 --> 01:13:56,020
And so they just set that as a research project.

1073
01:13:56,020 --> 01:13:57,900
Would that be an okay way to proceed?

1074
01:13:59,140 --> 01:14:02,500
Yes, it would, it would.

1075
01:14:03,660 --> 01:14:05,780
And it seems to be the way people do proceed.

1076
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:11,100
Well, it would, yes, in order to proceed that way,

1077
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:13,380
of course, they would have to be thinking

1078
01:14:13,380 --> 01:14:17,860
in terms of the particular, to me very mysterious,

1079
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:21,180
situations where they felt they couldn't do without them.

1080
01:14:21,180 --> 01:14:23,820
And then that's what they'd be doing

1081
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:26,220
in their continuing investigation.

1082
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:30,300
That would be to try to sharpen,

1083
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:35,300
define some concept that would serve

1084
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:38,660
that purpose and that could be appropriately

1085
01:14:38,660 --> 01:14:40,060
then be called properties.

1086
01:14:41,620 --> 01:14:44,460
The situation could be worse still.

1087
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:51,140
The familiar situation in, of course,

1088
01:14:51,140 --> 01:14:54,020
in theoretical physics, notably,

1089
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:57,980
is to introduce a new term for a technical purpose

1090
01:14:57,980 --> 01:15:01,780
without giving any definition at all, any clear definition.

1091
01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:06,220
The names for the elementary particles

1092
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:08,220
without exception are in that status.

1093
01:15:08,220 --> 01:15:09,740
They're not defined.

1094
01:15:09,740 --> 01:15:13,580
We're told a lot of things about them enough

1095
01:15:13,580 --> 01:15:15,340
so that one can get on.

1096
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:20,340
And conceivably, if there was something

1097
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:23,420
that might appropriately be called properties

1098
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:25,700
that seem to be needed in science,

1099
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:27,660
they might even be brought in that way.

1100
01:15:27,660 --> 01:15:29,300
And we would learn to put up with them

1101
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:31,420
by mastering all the things

1102
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:34,260
that can usefully be said about them,

1103
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:37,180
even though everyone was at a loss to define them.

1104
01:15:37,180 --> 01:15:41,220
That I'd, I'd face it, that would be, of course,

1105
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:45,020
what one always wishes for something clearer

1106
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:46,460
and more elegant, but you,

1107
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:51,460
but nature gets in there sometimes and prevents it.

1108
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:53,100
I wonder whether there'd be another point

1109
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:55,180
at which properties might need to come in.

1110
01:15:55,180 --> 01:16:00,180
Those who see events as the terms in causal relations

1111
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:03,020
are often driven to say something a little bit more,

1112
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:05,780
which is that some of the properties of an event

1113
01:16:05,780 --> 01:16:08,380
are causally efficacious, as it's said,

1114
01:16:08,380 --> 01:16:10,100
other properties of the event not.

1115
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:11,700
And just to be able to say that,

1116
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:13,620
on the face of it seems to be a matter

1117
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:15,220
of quantifying over properties.

1118
01:16:15,220 --> 01:16:17,980
Yes, well, the way I handle that one

1119
01:16:17,980 --> 01:16:22,620
is that I take the events as extensional.

1120
01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:27,660
And in fact, I do, in general,

1121
01:16:28,780 --> 01:16:33,140
think of a physical object as the,

1122
01:16:33,140 --> 01:16:37,780
in the most general sense, as the content

1123
01:16:37,780 --> 01:16:40,340
of some portion of space-time.

1124
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:42,060
It needn't be a continuous portion at all.

1125
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:43,740
It could be scattered.

1126
01:16:43,740 --> 01:16:46,980
It could be sugar, for instance,

1127
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:50,900
of, as an object for me,

1128
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:53,700
is a single physical object.

1129
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:57,580
It's all the sugar in the world, past, present, future.

1130
01:16:59,940 --> 01:17:01,740
Or, of course, one could equally just identify it

1131
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:04,820
with the portion of space-time that it takes up.

1132
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:08,140
That's purely a verbal difference at this point,

1133
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:08,980
it seems to me.

1134
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:14,860
And I think of events as physical objects,

1135
01:17:14,860 --> 01:17:17,940
in that sense, and as extensional.

1136
01:17:17,940 --> 01:17:21,500
And then the question arises that the question is you raised.

1137
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:24,740
Here you have an event of,

1138
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:33,740
well, let's see, I remember Davidson had an example

1139
01:17:33,740 --> 01:17:36,700
that brought this out.

1140
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:40,540
If I could, here's some sort of a contrivance

1141
01:17:40,540 --> 01:17:41,380
that's

1142
01:17:42,380 --> 01:17:43,380
of

1143
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:50,540
rotating, that's right, a heating up.

1144
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:58,540
And the heating up causes a bit of ice to melt

1145
01:17:58,540 --> 01:18:04,780
and the immediate environment, as we say,

1146
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:06,300
the heating up caused that.

1147
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:08,900
There's the property in a broad sense.

1148
01:18:12,380 --> 01:18:17,500
But the heating up, in this case, and the rotating,

1149
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:21,140
are inseparable.

1150
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:32,260
And so what I would say is, yes, so far as this,

1151
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:38,300
that although it's strange, strange usage,

1152
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:41,900
and after all, I'm not doing philosophy of ordinary language,

1153
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:47,300
but rather I prefer to be doing these things

1154
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:50,500
in the spirit of mathematicians who will bring in new symbols

1155
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:55,900
and new terms just in order to clarify what they're doing

1156
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:58,700
or make it simpler and easier to follow.

1157
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:05,700
And as far as I can see, it would fit all the purposes

1158
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:10,780
of science to make the following unidiomatic departure

1159
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:17,300
and say that, yes, that time, the spinning melted the ice.

1160
01:19:19,620 --> 01:19:25,220
The spinning of the event, the spinning of that wheel

1161
01:19:25,220 --> 01:19:29,620
melted the ice because the heating of the wheel

1162
01:19:29,620 --> 01:19:35,060
and the spinning of the wheel were both what the wheel was

1163
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:37,700
doing, was the state of the wheel.

1164
01:19:37,700 --> 01:19:43,620
No harm because the fact remains that our general law,

1165
01:19:43,620 --> 01:19:51,460
that nearby heating melts ice, stands,

1166
01:19:51,460 --> 01:19:56,780
and there's no suggestion of a law that some nearby spinning

1167
01:19:56,780 --> 01:19:59,340
melts ice.

1168
01:19:59,340 --> 01:20:02,220
I suppose you'd be unlucky if all the spinnings were

1169
01:20:02,220 --> 01:20:04,500
heating and all the heatings were spinning.

1170
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:11,100
Yes, well, that would pose a problem which scientists

1171
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:16,860
would be eager to get into, just why is that, but quite.

1172
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:19,220
So you're not inclined to go down the path of saying

1173
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:23,380
that the heating which is a spinning, on this occasion,

1174
01:20:23,380 --> 01:20:27,700
causes the ice to melt, causes quay heating the ice to melt,

1175
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:30,300
although it doesn't cause quay spinning the ice to melt.

1176
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:32,060
That's the point we should appeal to some, I think.

1177
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:35,780
Yes, well, that was all to some, I can imagine.

1178
01:20:35,780 --> 01:20:43,180
Oh, yes, so that would be a good day-to-day vernacular way

1179
01:20:43,180 --> 01:20:45,980
of doing it, despite of the non-vernacular status of quay.

1180
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:56,380
But I wouldn't, because that brings in concepts

1181
01:20:56,380 --> 01:20:59,500
that I don't think we need and that I find

1182
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:00,780
it clear to avoid.

1183
01:21:04,060 --> 01:21:07,340
I'm going to quit while I'm at it, I think.

1184
01:21:07,340 --> 01:21:11,660
About ontology, you share with Carnap

1185
01:21:11,660 --> 01:21:15,300
certain basic predilection for wanting

1186
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:17,420
to rob certain questions of their force.

1187
01:21:17,420 --> 01:21:22,140
For example, the question, what is an ordered pair really?

1188
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:25,620
Now, Carnap, one of, I think, his main motivation

1189
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:28,860
is to make sure that those sorts of questions don't make sense.

1190
01:21:28,900 --> 01:21:31,260
And he has this elaborate notion of framework

1191
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:33,460
and what's in a framework, what's outside a framework that

1192
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:35,420
does that work for him.

1193
01:21:35,420 --> 01:21:37,420
So how do you rob that kind of question?

1194
01:21:37,420 --> 01:21:40,020
Well, I think I'd agree with Carnap, not framework.

1195
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:43,420
No, but that's right, but I would agree with his conclusion.

1196
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:54,180
I think the trouble with this is that we're using a term that

1197
01:21:54,180 --> 01:21:58,060
hasn't been sufficiently, it hasn't been either defined

1198
01:21:58,060 --> 01:22:02,140
or sufficiently described, to cover the particular circumstance

1199
01:22:02,140 --> 01:22:06,540
that we're questioning, so that in that sense,

1200
01:22:06,540 --> 01:22:10,220
it's a meaningless question.

1201
01:22:10,220 --> 01:22:13,820
But as you've said, there is no entity without identity,

1202
01:22:13,820 --> 01:22:17,180
so you have to do something.

1203
01:22:17,180 --> 01:22:20,060
Yes, but which entity is it?

1204
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:28,740
Of course, that begs the question again,

1205
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:33,100
but I don't see how there's any dodging that one.

1206
01:22:33,100 --> 01:22:38,500
The ordered pair can be defined serviceably

1207
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:41,580
in any number of ways.

1208
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:47,020
And there are several ways that have come into the literature,

1209
01:22:47,020 --> 01:22:49,380
and it doesn't matter which ones you use,

1210
01:22:49,420 --> 01:22:55,180
just so you can prove the basic law of the ordered pair.

1211
01:22:55,180 --> 01:22:59,660
That x, y is identical with z, w if and only if x

1212
01:22:59,660 --> 01:23:03,100
is identical with z and y with w.

1213
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:09,740
And so for practical purposes, the meaning of ordered pair

1214
01:23:09,740 --> 01:23:12,060
is just that.

1215
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:18,420
And then in order for the sake of it,

1216
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:22,140
and commonly, we can leave it at that in practice and do.

1217
01:23:22,140 --> 01:23:24,220
And there's a corresponding situation,

1218
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:27,140
well-known in the case of saying what numbers are,

1219
01:23:27,140 --> 01:23:32,540
what the positive integers are, of different ways of doing it,

1220
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:35,540
all of which are perfectly good, and it doesn't matter which.

1221
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:45,540
And then there are two ways of looking at that situation,

1222
01:23:45,540 --> 01:23:49,380
in both the case of the pair and the numbers.

1223
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:52,500
Namely, one way is, yes, here we've

1224
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:55,700
got this ambiguous term ordered pair,

1225
01:23:55,700 --> 01:23:58,780
or the many kinds of ordered pair.

1226
01:23:58,780 --> 01:24:02,020
But I think that philosophically, the more straightforward way

1227
01:24:02,020 --> 01:24:06,180
is, in this case, elimination.

1228
01:24:06,180 --> 01:24:10,700
And say, now we've shown, here we've defined ordered pair.

1229
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:11,940
We're shown we're not going to need

1230
01:24:11,940 --> 01:24:14,140
to assume, as an irreducible notion,

1231
01:24:14,140 --> 01:24:16,380
the notion of ordered pair, because we've

1232
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:20,660
got other notions here, which, if we put them together

1233
01:24:20,660 --> 01:24:23,180
in the right combination, we'll do the same trick.

1234
01:24:23,180 --> 01:24:24,140
So let's do that.

1235
01:24:24,140 --> 01:24:25,620
And there are no such things as pairs.

1236
01:24:25,620 --> 01:24:26,780
Do the same thing about numbers.

1237
01:24:26,780 --> 01:24:30,780
There are no such things as the positive integers.

1238
01:24:30,780 --> 01:24:32,740
We're just talking about these sets.

1239
01:24:32,740 --> 01:24:37,860
But then it's awkward to keep, we need a name, a short name,

1240
01:24:37,860 --> 01:24:44,100
for these little constructions that we are serving as stand-ins.

1241
01:24:44,820 --> 01:24:46,540
For the pair.

1242
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:50,740
And so what better name, since we've already

1243
01:24:50,740 --> 01:24:52,300
freed the term ordered pair.

1244
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:53,660
It doesn't refer to anything anymore.

1245
01:24:53,660 --> 01:24:54,980
Those are gone.

1246
01:24:54,980 --> 01:24:55,980
Let's reuse it.

1247
01:24:55,980 --> 01:24:57,340
It's another kind of economy.

1248
01:25:00,860 --> 01:25:05,020
So that's the way I suggest looking at these situations.

1249
01:25:10,020 --> 01:25:12,020
Is there, do you see any relationship

1250
01:25:12,020 --> 01:25:14,060
between the particular situation one

1251
01:25:14,060 --> 01:25:17,340
is in here, and thinking about what numbers are

1252
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:20,860
or what an ordered pair is, and your general doctrine

1253
01:25:20,860 --> 01:25:24,100
of ontological relativity?

1254
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:28,060
That's, yeah, interesting thought.

1255
01:25:28,060 --> 01:25:28,560
I hadn't.

1256
01:25:34,220 --> 01:25:35,780
Well, yes, yes.

1257
01:25:35,780 --> 01:25:40,020
Yes, there certainly is in very broad terms.

1258
01:25:40,020 --> 01:25:42,780
The point about ontological relativity

1259
01:25:42,780 --> 01:25:51,780
was that there are certain functions,

1260
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:57,140
tagging functions, you might say, which

1261
01:25:57,140 --> 01:26:01,860
are various so-called objects we're performing.

1262
01:26:01,860 --> 01:26:05,620
But serving, really, as far as the logical structure

1263
01:26:05,620 --> 01:26:09,980
or even the empirical support and checkpoints

1264
01:26:09,980 --> 01:26:16,860
of our theory is concerned, mirror nodes

1265
01:26:16,860 --> 01:26:18,100
in the logical structure.

1266
01:26:26,380 --> 01:26:31,060
We can reshuffle these objects, put in any others that

1267
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:32,660
are in one one correlation with them.

1268
01:26:32,660 --> 01:26:34,380
They deserve that purpose just as well.

1269
01:26:36,620 --> 01:26:46,580
And so if we had some systematic way of naming these nodes,

1270
01:26:46,580 --> 01:26:49,580
neutral names, we could just put those in

1271
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:52,460
and just get rid of all these other names for objects.

1272
01:26:52,460 --> 01:26:57,900
However, we have no systematic way of naming those nodes.

1273
01:26:57,900 --> 01:27:01,460
The only thing we do is name them in our unsystematic way.

1274
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:04,780
And so we have these various terms for these various objects.

1275
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:08,300
And we talk about rabbits and this and that.

1276
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:11,900
But in talking about rabbits, cats, et cetera,

1277
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:22,540
we might just as well be talking about cat compliments

1278
01:27:22,540 --> 01:27:24,620
and rabbit compliments and the like.

1279
01:27:24,620 --> 01:27:27,900
So there's good parallel.

1280
01:27:27,900 --> 01:27:31,660
Would the following, though, be something of a difference?

1281
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:35,940
In my own language, of course, using my own language,

1282
01:27:35,940 --> 01:27:37,900
I can't use any other one.

1283
01:27:37,900 --> 01:27:40,580
And I can think to myself, well, I

1284
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:46,580
wonder whether the number one is such and such a set

1285
01:27:46,580 --> 01:27:50,540
or whether it is such and such a different set.

1286
01:27:50,540 --> 01:27:54,340
Which of these identity statements should I believe?

1287
01:27:54,340 --> 01:27:57,420
And it seems to me to be a genuine question.

1288
01:27:58,420 --> 01:28:05,620
But if I contrast that with the question,

1289
01:28:05,620 --> 01:28:13,140
I wonder whether my word or my linguistic expression,

1290
01:28:13,140 --> 01:28:20,140
the number one, really does refer to the number one.

1291
01:28:20,140 --> 01:28:23,500
That doesn't seem in the same way as if it could be

1292
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:27,020
a genuine question for me.

1293
01:28:27,020 --> 01:28:35,940
It seems a trivial matter of what the word refers to means

1294
01:28:35,940 --> 01:28:42,740
that my expression, the number one, does, for me,

1295
01:28:42,740 --> 01:28:44,660
pick out the number one.

1296
01:28:44,660 --> 01:28:47,420
Well, but then that raises the question

1297
01:28:47,420 --> 01:28:51,060
in that refers to the number one and what sense of number one.

1298
01:28:57,060 --> 01:28:59,740
In the case of abstract objects like the number one,

1299
01:28:59,740 --> 01:29:04,780
that seems to me that ontological relativity doesn't even

1300
01:29:04,780 --> 01:29:08,020
it doesn't even need to seem counterintuitive.

1301
01:29:08,020 --> 01:29:16,300
Frege, I seem to remember, raised the question or mentioned

1302
01:29:16,300 --> 01:29:20,820
the question, or the possibility, what is the number one?

1303
01:29:20,820 --> 01:29:22,740
It could be Julius Caesar.

1304
01:29:22,740 --> 01:29:24,380
Doesn't matter.

1305
01:29:25,380 --> 01:29:30,100
He went at least that far into ontological relativity.

1306
01:29:30,100 --> 01:29:33,980
And oh, and then Ramsey with his,

1307
01:29:33,980 --> 01:29:38,300
what have come since his day to be called Ramsey sentences,

1308
01:29:38,300 --> 01:29:40,500
rather brings out that point, again, for abstract objects.

1309
01:29:46,140 --> 01:29:49,180
It seems fairly intuitive that even

1310
01:29:49,180 --> 01:29:53,380
that abstract objects are brought in there just

1311
01:29:53,380 --> 01:29:59,540
as stopping points or to bring things together.

1312
01:30:03,620 --> 01:30:05,180
It wouldn't matter.

1313
01:30:05,180 --> 01:30:06,420
Well, of course, we know it.

1314
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:09,100
It doesn't matter how we go on and artificially

1315
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:15,500
define these numbers as long as we get the behavior out of them,

1316
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:23,740
the properties that make them useful in application.

1317
01:30:23,740 --> 01:30:26,060
And formerly, those properties are just

1318
01:30:26,060 --> 01:30:30,420
the properties of a regression, a sequence

1319
01:30:30,420 --> 01:30:32,060
of the kind called a progression.

1320
01:30:32,060 --> 01:30:45,460
But there's an example that we use of two physicists

1321
01:30:45,460 --> 01:30:51,580
who at a time out, did I have to do this before?

1322
01:30:51,580 --> 01:30:54,980
I know I mentioned it, but I'm not sure I did it,

1323
01:30:54,980 --> 01:30:56,980
about the neutrino and the physicists.

1324
01:30:56,980 --> 01:30:57,780
I know you didn't.

1325
01:30:57,780 --> 01:30:58,980
Good.

1326
01:30:58,980 --> 01:31:04,740
Well, yes, this, I think, brings out some of the spirit of it.

1327
01:31:04,740 --> 01:31:09,620
There's a crisis in physics, and something

1328
01:31:09,620 --> 01:31:12,820
has to be done in revising the theory or supplementing it.

1329
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:17,140
And one physicist suggested maybe we

1330
01:31:17,140 --> 01:31:18,220
needed a new particle.

1331
01:31:18,220 --> 01:31:22,180
In fact, two physicists arrived at that idea

1332
01:31:22,180 --> 01:31:25,620
of introducing a new particle with certain properties

1333
01:31:25,620 --> 01:31:31,820
that will help clear up the paradox.

1334
01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:39,020
And one of them brings in a particle that has some rest mass,

1335
01:31:39,020 --> 01:31:42,300
and the other one brings in a particle that has no rest mass.

1336
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:46,180
But they both apply the same word, neutrino.

1337
01:31:46,180 --> 01:31:48,620
And it seems to me it presents no problem

1338
01:31:48,620 --> 01:31:52,820
to say that there's clearly no meaning to the question

1339
01:31:52,820 --> 01:31:56,660
whether, A, they are talking about the same particle,

1340
01:31:56,660 --> 01:32:01,860
but disagree in its properties, or B,

1341
01:32:01,860 --> 01:32:03,500
they're talking about different particles.

1342
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:05,540
One has a rest mass, the other hasn't,

1343
01:32:05,540 --> 01:32:08,700
but they happen to have given it the same name.

1344
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:10,060
No difference.

1345
01:32:10,060 --> 01:32:14,700
And well, I think that applies, again,

1346
01:32:14,700 --> 01:32:19,180
to the example of the numbers, yes, the numbers,

1347
01:32:19,180 --> 01:32:23,020
and to the example of the ordered pairs,

1348
01:32:23,020 --> 01:32:29,020
that one has certain services that,

1349
01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:32,660
in case the ordered pair is, I think, particularly

1350
01:32:32,660 --> 01:32:35,620
conspicuous this way, because ordered pair isn't even

1351
01:32:35,620 --> 01:32:39,420
a common sense notion to the extent that 1, 2, 3 are.

1352
01:32:39,460 --> 01:32:44,580
And all that's wanted is something

1353
01:32:44,580 --> 01:32:52,020
that is going to carry the individuality of both x and y,

1354
01:32:52,020 --> 01:32:54,740
and not vice versa.

1355
01:32:54,740 --> 01:32:57,540
And some further entity, then, in addition

1356
01:32:57,540 --> 01:33:00,740
to the x and the y, anything will do.

1357
01:33:00,740 --> 01:33:02,900
And then they cast it out and find, yeah,

1358
01:33:02,900 --> 01:33:06,980
here's something it'll do.

1359
01:33:06,980 --> 01:33:08,380
There's a little class of two members

1360
01:33:08,420 --> 01:33:11,180
that's easy to describe.

1361
01:33:11,180 --> 01:33:12,900
Not just the class of the members x and y,

1362
01:33:12,900 --> 01:33:15,700
but a little more complicated.

1363
01:33:15,700 --> 01:33:17,660
Someone else comes up with an equally simple one,

1364
01:33:17,660 --> 01:33:20,420
but a different one, and that's a situation

1365
01:33:20,420 --> 01:33:22,020
where it doesn't matter.

1366
01:33:22,020 --> 01:33:24,340
You have this function, that function

1367
01:33:24,340 --> 01:33:27,860
in the sense of service, not in the mathematical sense,

1368
01:33:27,860 --> 01:33:33,660
to be performed, and anything will do in the pinch.

1369
01:33:33,660 --> 01:33:36,860
And then the sweeping theory, finally,

1370
01:33:37,420 --> 01:33:40,180
of ontological relativity is that that's

1371
01:33:40,180 --> 01:33:41,180
the way with all reference.

1372
01:33:44,380 --> 01:33:51,540
But what makes it, I'd say, counter-intuitive to all of us

1373
01:33:51,540 --> 01:33:53,780
is when it's not a question of abstract objects anymore,

1374
01:33:53,780 --> 01:34:02,220
like ordered pairs and numbers, but sensible objects.

1375
01:34:03,100 --> 01:34:14,140
So this is where one has to consider, and keep in mind,

1376
01:34:14,140 --> 01:34:18,180
that the sensory associations are undisturbed

1377
01:34:18,180 --> 01:34:20,780
in all this reshuffling of objects

1378
01:34:20,780 --> 01:34:25,740
in the course of ontological relativity,

1379
01:34:25,740 --> 01:34:31,100
one-to-one reinterpretations.

1380
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:33,900
The sensory connotations remain.

1381
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:42,420
And when a body ends up being identified or supplanted,

1382
01:34:42,420 --> 01:34:50,660
as you prefer, either way, by a class of quadruples of numbers,

1383
01:34:50,660 --> 01:34:53,580
the sensory qualities of that body,

1384
01:34:53,580 --> 01:34:56,220
the qualities by which you learned it

1385
01:34:56,220 --> 01:34:58,860
through ostention or whatever, carry over

1386
01:34:58,860 --> 01:35:04,460
to that class of quadruples of numbers.

1387
01:35:10,180 --> 01:35:14,100
So it's a matter of shifting one's emphasis

1388
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:19,260
from the object to the sentence, ultimately

1389
01:35:19,260 --> 01:35:21,980
to the observation sentences, as far as their objects

1390
01:35:21,980 --> 01:35:25,340
that we've learned by ostention, objects whose names we've

1391
01:35:25,340 --> 01:35:27,900
learned by ostention.

1392
01:35:27,900 --> 01:35:30,260
And those go along unaffected.

1393
01:35:30,260 --> 01:35:36,140
And what the theory of ontological relativity

1394
01:35:36,140 --> 01:35:45,780
brings out is just that really the entity, the object hood,

1395
01:35:45,780 --> 01:35:53,580
the object hood is not really what matters here.

1396
01:35:53,820 --> 01:35:58,140
Two things that do matter are, one,

1397
01:35:58,140 --> 01:36:02,900
all this bundle of sensory qualities

1398
01:36:02,900 --> 01:36:06,140
to put the thing in mentalistic terms,

1399
01:36:06,140 --> 01:36:09,580
all the association when it comes to a neural league

1400
01:36:09,580 --> 01:36:13,660
with the sensory input.

1401
01:36:13,660 --> 01:36:16,540
That's one of the two things that matter.

1402
01:36:16,540 --> 01:36:20,620
And the other thing that matters is the role it plays,

1403
01:36:20,620 --> 01:36:27,580
the service it performs as a node in the theoretical structure,

1404
01:36:27,580 --> 01:36:30,260
the logical structure of the scientific theory.

1405
01:36:30,260 --> 01:36:32,980
And then what the thesis of ontological relativity

1406
01:36:32,980 --> 01:36:36,500
brings out is these are two separate purposes

1407
01:36:36,500 --> 01:36:42,900
and can be separated, even be separated ontologically,

1408
01:36:42,900 --> 01:36:46,100
in that the ontology can be reshuffled at will

1409
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:49,060
to within one to one for the one.

1410
01:36:49,060 --> 01:36:56,660
And on the other hand, the sensory input stays put.

1411
01:36:56,660 --> 01:37:01,340
In your long career as a teacher and professor,

1412
01:37:01,340 --> 01:37:05,620
you must have encountered a great number of students

1413
01:37:05,620 --> 01:37:09,100
who have gone on some within philosophy

1414
01:37:09,100 --> 01:37:13,220
and some outside of philosophy to pursue careers.

1415
01:37:13,220 --> 01:37:15,940
Does anyone in particular, or do any of them in particular,

1416
01:37:15,940 --> 01:37:18,340
stand out in your mind as?

1417
01:37:18,340 --> 01:37:19,260
Oh, yes, indeed.

1418
01:37:19,260 --> 01:37:29,700
Of course, of the earlier ones, Donald Davidson,

1419
01:37:29,700 --> 01:37:45,020
then in logic, there have been a few, certainly not so much

1420
01:37:45,020 --> 01:37:48,100
of my students who have gone successfully

1421
01:37:48,100 --> 01:37:50,380
into computer theory and the like.

1422
01:37:50,380 --> 01:38:00,340
But philosophers, later generations,

1423
01:38:00,340 --> 01:38:05,460
of course, I think of Doug Finfield Estelle and Roger

1424
01:38:05,460 --> 01:38:13,260
Gibson, I'm mentioning ones that have gone on,

1425
01:38:13,260 --> 01:38:17,340
carrying on more or less my point of view.
