0	10800	Professor Warren Goldfab, chairman of the philosophy department
10800	15240	at Harvard University, is our guest panelist in this program.
15240	17520	He specializes in logic, history of logic,
17520	20920	and philosophy of mathematics, and has translated and edited
20920	24080	the logical writings of Jacques Herbrand.
24080	26840	He has also coauthored with Bertrand Reben the decision
26840	32200	problem in solvable classes of quantificational formulae.
32200	34440	The program begins with a discussion of Professor
34440	37360	Quine's early philosophical career at Harvard
37360	39440	and consideration of his relationship
39440	42040	with the logical positivists of the Vienna circle,
42040	45360	most notably with Rudolf Carnat.
45360	48080	This background sets the stage for a thorough discussion
48080	50640	of Quine's naturalism, and in particular,
50640	53480	his naturalized epistemology.
53480	55960	Questions about the famous two dogmas are raised,
55960	59200	and then attention is drawn to his doctrines of extensionalism
59200	62040	and ontological relativity.
62040	66800	We now join the discussion in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
66800	70560	Joining Professor Quine for this discussion are Warren Goldfab,
70560	73480	professor of philosophy at Harvard University,
73480	77040	Paul Horwich, professor of philosophy at MIT,
77040	80000	and Martin Davies, wild reader in mental philosophy
80000	81080	at Oxford University.
81600	89560	In 1932, the Quine set sail for Europe destination was Vienna.
89560	94080	Herbert Feigl, who was at Harvard University from Vienna
94080	98720	at that time, had suggested to Quine, who had already
98720	103040	achieved acclaim as a logician, that the main action in logic
103040	107800	would be found in Vienna, and perhaps in the person of Rudolf
107840	111040	Carnat, who was ultimately to play a great role in Quine's
111040	112000	development as a philosopher.
115000	118160	Before going into the influence that the Vienna circle had
118160	123040	on your work, I'd like to ask you, what was the situation at
123040	126200	Harvard at that time, particularly in the field of logic?
129200	134640	At that time, logic was very weakened in America generally.
135000	140880	As far as I know, hardly any of them taught the subject.
140880	146800	Harvard was looked to, prided itself on being perhaps
146800	151200	the greatest center for logic in America.
154360	158280	After I'd been there for a little while,
158280	159880	I'd been there for a little while,
160880	164760	after I'd been there for a little while,
164760	168200	I came to feel that this was, well,
168200	172440	this profession reminded me of the Wizard of Oz.
177640	181480	I was learning virtually no logic that I hadn't already
181480	187040	imbibed as an undergraduate from my unsupervised honors
187040	187540	reading.
190880	192800	Pardon.
192800	195520	Who were the main characters at that time at Harvard?
198320	203240	In logic, the three names associated with logic were
203240	208960	Whitehead, Clarence Serving Lewis, and Harry Sheffer.
208960	212480	Whitehead, of course, with a very good reason,
212480	216320	because he and Bertrand Russell had done this monumental three
216320	221400	volume work on mathematical logic, the work that
221400	224480	was far and away the greatest thing in that subject,
224480	227160	and virtually the only great thing
227160	229640	that I'd become aware of up to then.
234600	236800	Lewis had done many years earlier.
236800	240280	In fact, as far back as 1918, the book
240280	245600	had appeared a survey of symbolic logic
245640	255200	in which he did a good job of reporting the developments
255200	259600	at the hands of Burs and Boulle and the others,
259600	262360	and some small extent, perhaps, Fraga.
265520	269800	His teaching, he was perhaps my most influential teacher,
269800	274560	from a point of view of straight classroom contact.
274600	276440	His course in Kant, and his course
276440	278120	in his own theory of knowledge.
282160	283240	He wasn't teaching logic.
286120	290280	What little logic I associated with him from reading,
290280	292400	I was not sympathetic with, because it was modal logic.
292400	296040	In fact, he was very much the pioneer, the American pioneer
296040	300800	in, or the pioneer, I should say, in the modal logic
300800	301480	of necessity.
304920	309160	Harry Shuffer was the one who was giving logic courses,
309160	313640	but they were just altogether too thin.
316360	325280	And there was no inkling of the current excitement
325280	332320	in Central Europe at the hands of Tarski and ≈Åukasziewicz
332760	338320	and others in Poland, and Hilbert Ackermann Bernice
338320	341000	in Germany, got it again.
341000	345760	So you met Karnath in Europe in 1932,
345760	348920	and you clearly found he had a lot to offer.
348920	351280	In 1934, you gave a series of lectures
351280	354240	on his program of logical syntax.
354240	357640	Those lectures are very sympathetic to him,
357640	359480	but pretty soon you found yourself
359520	363800	having some differences with that program and with Karnath.
363800	367840	Let's know, where did you first find your differences with Karnath?
367840	371160	What were the initial difficulties you first
371160	373920	found yourself running into in thinking about executing
373920	374480	the program?
374480	376520	Yes.
376520	379360	The first occasion, apparently, and I
379360	382880	didn't learn this until just within the past few years,
382880	388240	was as far back as March 1933, when I was there with Karnath
388240	394760	and was getting so much stimulation and knowledge
394760	396760	of philosophy from him.
400120	402480	I didn't know that until it was turned up by Neil Tennant
402480	408160	and a log that Karnath had kept in his methodical way,
408160	417640	where day after day in Prague, when he wasn't going into lecture,
417640	424760	I would go out to where he lived and we would discuss,
424760	428600	because I was reading his logical syntax of language
428600	431080	in the German edition.
431080	433760	As it came out of the typewriter, it hadn't yet appeared.
433760	435080	It wasn't to appear for another year.
438560	442600	Karnath entered in this log that I had expressed questions
442600	447720	about the analyticity, some doubt about it.
447720	450040	And his reflection was that perhaps I
450040	454400	was right in thinking, I'm not sure how accurately I
454400	456760	remember this three or four line passage,
456760	459000	but perhaps I was right in thinking
459000	470200	that it was a matter of degree, until this recent archaeological
470240	472560	discovery.
472560	478400	I thought of 1935, when I was writing Truth by Convention,
478400	484000	that came out in 36 for a festrift for Whitehead,
484000	488120	as being my first manifestation, certainly, of that doubt.
488120	504440	And certainly by 39, 40, it had become really quite a firm doubt
504440	507040	and not just a tentative misgivings.
512160	517440	I'd like to ask you about your attitude towards the positivist
517440	523520	doctrine that metaphysics is meaningless in discussing
523520	528000	the so-called inverted spectrum hypothesis,
528000	530960	a hypothesis that, for all I know,
530960	533000	other people are seeing red things the way
533000	535840	I see green things in vice versa.
535840	539000	In reaction to that, you said you thought
539000	543240	this hypothesis would be unverifiable and therefore
543240	544720	meaningless.
544720	547680	And this sounds exactly the sort of thing
547680	552600	that the hard-line positivist would have said.
552600	554800	Does this show that you are, in fact,
554800	557600	a hard-line positivist in this respect?
557600	558280	No, I can agree.
558280	561400	This is exactly what the hard-line positivist would have said.
561400	565520	I wouldn't say it or I wouldn't mean that anyway.
565520	568880	What I perhaps said, perhaps I started
568880	572920	out saying that for one thing, it's unverifiable.
572920	577160	And then I should have gone on to say, whether I did or not,
577160	582440	that I can't even see how, by connecting it up
582440	587000	with other hypotheses, getting it into the network
587000	592680	of the web of belief, that it would link up indirectly
592680	599200	with verification, that it seemed to be simply inaccessible
599200	605040	to scientific developments that we can project,
605040	607240	that we can imagine and foresee.
607240	610000	And that, it seems to me, should qualify something
610000	615600	that purports to be a statement or a question of fact
615600	621920	as meaningless in the positivist way.
621960	624800	So you do countenance, then, a class
624800	634400	of meaningless, unverifiable, metaphysical sentences.
634400	635880	Yes, yes.
635880	643200	But it's way out, as I think it feels this is,
643200	651880	because I don't even consider it necessary for meaningfulness.
651880	656160	That a sentence be indirectly connectable
656160	663960	with observation, that it be part of a network.
663960	667440	I wouldn't require that the sentence be indirectly
667440	669120	verifiable in this sense.
669120	676120	That there be a set of sentences which together have
676120	677680	what I've called critical mass.
677680	685720	And that they together will imply an observationally
685720	692600	testable situation and would include the sentence
692600	696560	in question and would lose its critical mass
696560	698760	if, when that was removed from the class,
698760	704040	that would be a way of explaining what it would mean,
704040	708160	perhaps for a sentence to have empirical content at all
708160	713640	that would share empirical content in this essential way.
713640	715400	I wouldn't insist on that by any means.
715400	720440	And I don't think that the bulk of sentences in history
720440	723480	or perhaps in various social sciences,
723480	729920	nor perhaps all of them even in serious rigorous physics
729920	732320	meet even that test.
732320	735400	And I don't think that for that reason,
735400	737680	they should be rejected as meaningless.
737680	747360	Because they are sentences that we have postulated or accepted.
747360	752240	That is, we've conjectured them, accepted them,
752240	754800	because they seem to fit in so nicely
754800	756800	with the theory that is working.
756800	758600	Perhaps considerations of symmetry,
758600	763320	perhaps it seems to fill a nice little conceptual gap.
763320	764560	And I think that furthermore, they
764560	769200	can be vital to the progress of science,
769200	775720	because they are, I imagine, a very important, maybe
775720	781640	overwhelmingly large part of the heuristics
781640	787480	of the fashioning of worthwhile scientific hypotheses.
787480	791400	That is to say, hypotheses that are worth testing,
791400	793080	rather than desperately erring away one's time
793080	797760	on hypotheses that we ought to have thought
797760	802000	were very unlikely to come out right when tested.
802000	804760	So I think that's a vital part of science.
804760	808400	And in fact, it's because of, including all these,
808400	816800	that I can't envision any sharp demarcation.
816800	823280	I'm with Carl Popper in this, between science and metaphysics
823280	828280	in the in the primitive sense.
828280	830480	That does raise a question, though.
830480	833800	The positivists were very fond of demarcation criteria,
833800	838640	not just to separate science from metaphysics,
838640	842120	but also to separate science from pseudoscience.
842120	844520	So the question is, how would you handle a question in which
844520	847480	someone might want to bring into question something,
847480	850560	for example, like psychoanalytic theory,
850560	854000	as to whether that really had scientific status or not.
854000	855720	The positivists would handle such a question
855720	857840	by their general criteria.
857840	860160	How would you handle such a question?
860160	865480	Yes, well, I think the effect that that consideration has on me
865480	872480	is rather that I'm very suspicious of it and dubious of it.
872520	875960	I can conceive that it might be helpful in some of the suggestions,
875960	878200	some of the things, perhaps some of the things that are said
878200	883000	about dreams or some of the things that are said about inhibitions
883000	884920	from earlier experiences, this way,
884920	893320	that can inspire somebody with a more scientific temper
893320	897400	to some constructive ideas that will go on.
897400	898920	Maybe it's already happened.
899920	902880	But the sort of culture is developed
902880	909640	and the trust that's been put into it as something therapeutic
909640	915200	and worth spending an awful lot of time and money treating oneself
915200	918840	to, that makes the thing certainly a great evil.
918840	921600	And I'm not sympathetic with it at all.
921600	929520	But I think to this extent, it's more nearly continuous
929520	936040	with science than it should be for me to be single-mindedly
936040	938440	inclined to brand it as meaningless.
941320	946080	The critics of verificationism used to devise sentences
946080	949960	which were apparently meaningful but which were cooked up in such a way
950000	953080	as not to be susceptible of empirical confirmation
953080	955240	or falsification either.
955240	957200	I seem to recall some sentence along the lines
957200	959640	of there's a planet for whose existence
959640	962080	we shall never have any evidence.
962080	965000	Would you want to say the same about those sentences
965000	969280	as you say about sentences in the outer reaches of mathematics,
969280	975160	which is that overall simplicity can be our only guide?
975160	979600	No, I think the situation isn't as clear with those sentences
979600	985760	because those sentences might be related in the way
985760	993560	that I was sketching through these various systematic kinships
993560	997760	to such sentences so as to be valuable in the theory
997760	1003080	that they're fitting into the web of belief in such a way
1003080	1009440	as to seem very likely to belong.
1010440	1016160	Well, in a way, those sentences of higher mathematics
1016160	1020520	have that too in one direction, namely they are results
1020520	1025040	of simply continuing to apply and extrapolate the grammar
1025040	1029480	and lexicon that we've been needing for scientific purposes.
1029480	1037440	And that's a very clear and unconjectural link that they have.
1037440	1040640	And it's the only reason, my only reason,
1040640	1043760	for taking them seriously as a part of science.
1048360	1052360	So I think a detailed structural connection is different.
1052360	1056040	What about the idea of taking the inverted spectrum
1056040	1059240	hypothesis or its negation as just being a sentence
1059240	1062760	in the outer reaches of phenomenology, where once again
1062760	1065040	we'd say, well, we are allowed to be meaningful
1065040	1067520	because it's just using over again vocabulary
1067520	1071040	that we use in more workaday circumstances.
1071040	1074480	And we'll once again just let the truth value fall where it may
1074480	1076560	in light of overall simplicity, I guess,
1076560	1078160	in which case you'd go for the denial
1078160	1080440	of the inverted spectrum hypothesis.
1080440	1083960	Yes, well, that's an interesting suggestion
1083960	1088800	because I was about to wonder, all right,
1088800	1092560	if we admit it, which way is our decision going to go on?
1092560	1093320	That's truth value.
1097920	1101960	People wonder about the outer reaches of mathematics as well.
1101960	1103840	Well, there we can settle for simplicity.
1103840	1109240	I can't see simplicity coming into the act, in this case,
1109240	1112440	which is a commentary also on how independent it
1112440	1116120	seems to be from anything scientific.
1116120	1118440	I wonder if you recognize a class of sentences
1118440	1121480	that are meaningless in a more definitive way
1121520	1126400	than simply not seeming to have any empirical consequences
1126400	1130080	or the possibility of any fitting into the web of belief.
1130080	1134880	I have in mind Wittgenstein's example.
1134880	1137760	It is five o'clock on the sun.
1137760	1138240	Oh, good.
1138240	1144920	Where it looks as though, although grammatically OK,
1144920	1148160	how one feels like saying, well, five o'clock
1148160	1149640	hasn't been defined for the sun.
1149640	1151160	It doesn't make any sense to us,
1151160	1153600	whether it's five o'clock on the sun.
1153600	1156240	What's your reaction to kind of set?
1161240	1163640	Well, a characteristic of this kind of example, I suppose,
1163640	1172680	is that we can prove on the basis of principles
1172680	1177000	that we all, unhesitatingly, accept anyway, I should think,
1177000	1186880	that there couldn't be any criterion or any criterion
1186880	1192200	that would fit in usefully with the rest of science
1192200	1193880	in which those same terms are used.
1197120	1199720	Maybe it's just the virtue of this.
1199720	1201680	If it is a virtue, it's a clear case.
1201680	1202160	I see.
1203160	1208760	We've been talking about some of the historical influences
1208760	1213920	on you, just about Karnap, who does seem to have been predominant.
1213920	1217600	But there was one very centrally influential book
1217600	1221440	on all of the philosophers of the inner circle, not just Karnap.
1221440	1223360	And that was Wittgenstein's Tractatus.
1223360	1226240	They all read it quite numerous times,
1226240	1228880	and it clearly impacted all of their work.
1228920	1233200	Did it have any direct effects on you and in your work?
1233200	1235840	I'm not aware of us having had any positive effect.
1235840	1237920	I didn't like it.
1237920	1239640	I read it early.
1239640	1240560	I can't think how early.
1245480	1249200	Very likely, already, when I was a graduate student there in 31,
1249200	1257600	32, although not in the course, no, I didn't like it.
1257640	1260920	I didn't like the absoluteness of his atomism.
1263600	1270240	Also, of course, I was put off somewhat
1270240	1277600	by his being so blithe about construing quantification
1277600	1281320	as just the infinite case of truth functions.
1281320	1285200	The analogy is important, but I guess I
1285240	1290080	may have felt at the time any way that he wasn't taking
1290080	1295040	the difficulties of actually acting on this
1295040	1296080	into consideration.
1296080	1299200	Wasn't appreciating.
1299200	1302200	Also, it seemed to me that his treatment of number
1302200	1309640	in terms of relations was untidy.
1309640	1313800	And I couldn't see why it wasn't clearly so inferior
1313800	1316960	to the much simpler definition of number
1316960	1323280	that Russell had already given, which followed Frege.
1323280	1326880	So it was a bit much later work that I found more sympathetic.
1334120	1338200	The two dogmas that you reject in your article,
1338200	1345600	two dogmas of empiricism, are the analytic, synthetic
1345600	1349360	distinction, the distinction between matters of statements
1349360	1351600	that are true in virtue of their meanings alone,
1351600	1355280	statements that are true in virtue of the facts,
1355280	1359000	and the other dogma is reductionism,
1359000	1361400	the idea that every meaningful sentence
1361400	1364760	has its own empirical content can
1364760	1369920	be reduced to observational facts in one way or another.
1369920	1373600	I wanted to ask you about the relationship
1373600	1379600	between your criticisms of these two doctrines.
1379600	1387680	In particular, does your critique, your rejection
1387680	1390480	of the analytic, synthetic distinction
1390480	1393320	play any role in the line of thought
1393320	1397640	that takes you from the denial of reductionism
1397640	1401560	to the web of belief, to your renunciation
1401560	1402880	of a priori knowledge?
1412720	1418840	My wholism was already present in two dogmas.
1418880	1427400	In fact, in the two dogmas where everybody reads it,
1427400	1430280	there's a footnote to duem.
1433200	1438520	Actually, that footnote is misleading in that I didn't
1438520	1442440	know anything about duem when I presented two dogmas
1442440	1447360	as a lecture or when it first appeared as an article in January
1447360	1449880	1951.
1449880	1455080	And it was Peter Hemphill, that is, Carl G. Hemphill,
1455080	1460560	and also independently, Philip Franck,
1460560	1469520	who, having read that article, said how yes, that's like duem.
1469520	1472480	And so I added that footnote when the thing was reprinted
1472480	1476640	in from a logical point of view by way of giving duem credit.
1477320	1480480	It seemed to be claiming this as something, some novel
1480480	1483640	contributions, just a matter of presenting it
1483640	1487120	as being the way things are.
1487120	1492760	Anyway, so I had come to that somehow.
1492760	1499280	And it's hard to say, it's not a very clean cut idea,
1499280	1502640	somewhere along the line from Truth by Convention
1502640	1505080	to Two Dogmas.
1505080	1508920	And then, the Web of Belief, well,
1508920	1513240	that was a very, I think, an admirable and catchy title
1513240	1516880	due to my collaborator, Joe Ullian.
1516880	1518360	But that's just more of the same.
1524920	1529160	When I was writing Two Dogmas, I brought that in.
1530160	1534480	And structurally, its position in that article
1534480	1538920	is, as one possible consideration to help account
1538920	1543920	for the rather strange fact that people take analyticity,
1543920	1547320	even analyticity across the board the way they do,
1547320	1553760	so uncritically, that there may be a failure to appreciate
1553760	1558040	that reductionism won't do.
1558040	1559680	Fail to appreciate wholism.
1563800	1569440	As for whether it was this wholistic view that
1569440	1575200	made me skeptical of analyticity in the first place,
1575200	1580320	I just can't judge, because something
1580320	1583840	like an appreciation of that can be
1583840	1588840	vague and inarticulate enough so that it
1588840	1590440	doesn't come out explicitly.
1590440	1592760	And I had thought of it as such.
1592760	1598960	It's the same, the two attitudes, the wholism,
1598960	1602360	therefore, anti-reductionism in that particular instance
1602360	1604240	of reduction.
1604240	1608000	And the skepticism about meaning and analyticity
1608000	1611600	are so much of a piece.
1611640	1615440	Incidentally, that anti-reductionism
1615440	1617640	has certainly caused misunderstandings,
1617640	1621920	because I am not against reductionism as such,
1621920	1623840	for heaven's sake.
1623840	1626680	I'm very fond of it.
1626680	1629720	More reduction, the better.
1629720	1634560	And it's just this particular case of it.
1634560	1643640	Could your line of thought, which involves rejecting
1643640	1648600	the reductionism in this epistemological form,
1648600	1651120	the reduction of any theoretical statement
1651120	1655240	to observation statements, which goes from there
1655240	1659520	to wholism and the web of belief and the rejection
1659520	1662520	of a priori knowledge, could that
1662520	1669280	proceed independently of any critique of analyticity?
1669280	1671680	They're so closely mentioned, it's hard to say.
1671680	1679960	But I think just because of the developing situation,
1679960	1687640	the circumstances when these questions arose,
1687640	1696040	it was certainly what I became clearly aware of was
1696040	1698520	misgivings specifically over analyticity.
1698520	1702480	That was because of the way Carnot was using it.
1702480	1706480	But I thought of it, then, as an objection that,
1706480	1709960	and still in two dogmas, I thought of it,
1709960	1715480	as a matter of not having given a satisfactory definition
1715480	1718400	of his terms, of his term analyticity.
1722640	1724120	But the difficulty of doing so, then,
1724120	1730320	is of a piece with the wholism.
1730320	1732800	If he had managed to, or if someone
1732800	1736600	had managed to give it a characterization of analyticity
1736600	1741360	from which it would not follow that an analytic truth could
1741360	1745440	be known a priori, then would that
1745880	1747840	conception of analyticity have been
1747840	1753240	able to play the philosophical role that it
1753240	1758640	was being asked to play prior to two dogmas?
1758640	1762080	I think it's something like the definition of analyticity
1762080	1764800	that I propose in roots of reference.
1764800	1766560	For example, yes.
1766560	1771880	No, that's certainly unscathed.
1771920	1775880	Just going back to two dogmas for a moment,
1775880	1778200	Freddie Ayer cited you as being responsible,
1778200	1780440	or partly responsible, for the dismantling
1780440	1784080	of logical positivism because of your attack,
1784080	1787920	your twin attacks on the analytic synthetic distinction
1787920	1790360	and reductionism in that paper.
1790360	1794640	And we've spoken privately a bit about Freddie Ayer
1794640	1797400	and his position at that time when you met him,
1797400	1799680	and subsequently, as you observed
1799720	1803680	his philosophical connection to logical positivism
1803680	1805560	and how it differed from your own.
1805560	1806880	And you've expressed a willingness
1806880	1809600	to say something about this.
1809600	1812320	So would you tell us about that?
1812320	1818600	Well, it seemed to me in his influential first book,
1818600	1826240	Language, Truth, and Logic, he came out, interestingly,
1826280	1828880	in between the two phases of Carnop
1828880	1834920	that it seemed to me so abruptly different.
1834920	1837880	The Carnop of the logisher Aufbau,
1837880	1841520	where he was very much the phenomenalist,
1841520	1848080	and the later Carnop, where he's a, well,
1848920	1859000	I'd say he's taken on naturalism along more specifically
1859000	1861760	with his physicalism.
1861760	1867520	In fact, it eases the transition from the earlier
1867520	1870840	Carnop to the later one and makes it more intelligible.
1870840	1877240	I can't see quite how to pin it down
1877600	1878720	in the way of specific points.
1882800	1885400	The book was impressive to me.
1885400	1893080	The way so much in philosophy came under his criticism.
1893080	1896800	The book, from beginning to end, focuses primarily
1896800	1899720	on meaninglessness of metaphysics,
1899720	1902360	and one metaphysical, one philosophical,
1902360	1903880	traditional philosophical question,
1903880	1905480	or issue after another is taken up,
1905480	1913880	and then he argues, shows how it is hopelessly
1913880	1916160	unempirical and how it goes.
1916160	1920480	And this is leading up, directs it well,
1920480	1929600	and so this makes for a close continuity, again,
1929600	1933920	between the Vienna circle of the later Carnop
1933920	1938480	and the Wittgenstein of his days in England,
1938480	1941360	where philosophy becomes, under Wittgenstein,
1941360	1947640	a straight therapeutic undertaking,
1947640	1952120	and philosophical problems are results
1952120	1953880	of misuse of language that can be cured.
1953880	1962520	And the point pointing out of just the way
1962520	1969120	that air felt that language had gone wrong in these cases,
1969120	1971960	sometimes is the way he handles the questions
1971960	1975720	and showing them, showing that they're meaningless.
1975720	1977960	And he certainly produced something
1977960	1982760	that gives the spirit of the Vienna circle
1982760	1986440	for the reader who runs.
1986440	1992280	It's not intellectually exacting.
1992280	2000200	It can be read and depreciated by wide circle and was.
2003200	2009760	Very important point of view of the history
2009760	2014280	and geography of philosophy.
2014280	2017160	You've said that naturalism is one
2017160	2019840	of the main components of your philosophy.
2019840	2022080	That's the view, roughly speaking,
2022080	2028280	that science is the only road to genuine knowledge.
2028280	2030800	I'd like to ask you about this.
2030800	2034360	Do you think that this naturalist doctrine
2034360	2037400	can be established or in any way justified,
2037400	2039600	or does it have to be a basic axiom?
2045000	2051800	Well, no.
2051800	2054640	I think perhaps the avenue has to be something like this,
2054640	2060000	that you're engaged in science and have recognized
2060000	2067080	what implicitly or explicitly that the checkpoints
2067080	2069320	of science, insofar as they exist,
2069320	2073920	are checkpoints in observation through that channel
2073920	2077880	of applying the observational setup.
2082640	2088120	And you appreciate that without considering
2088120	2091040	that what doesn't submit to that test is meaningless.
2091040	2093520	Of course, I've just been arguing against that point of view.
2093520	2097880	But insofar as there is a check, that's what it is.
2097880	2103120	And so this would make one critical of the transcendental
2103120	2108480	intrusions, as if there were other sources,
2108480	2118080	either in a priori knowledge of the human or divine revelation
2118120	2124120	as a support underpinning for science and its method.
2124120	2132960	But I feel that naturalism is and was very widespread.
2132960	2134000	Nothing new about this.
2134000	2141560	I adopted the term, introduced, I don't know which,
2141560	2146200	naturalistic epistemology or epistemology naturalized
2146200	2149880	for a specific application, namely,
2149880	2154520	getting away from the notion of a phenomenalistic reduction
2154520	2161320	of scientific concepts in order to endow them with meaning
2161320	2166440	in favor of going at those questions from within,
2166440	2168200	from within science itself.
2168200	2173520	And this is certainly quite a clear and undistakeable
2173520	2179440	contrast between my way of doing things and Carnop's
2179440	2183520	Aufbau to take extreme case.
2183520	2187080	But on the other hand, naturalistic philosophy,
2187080	2190240	generally, it seems to me, Hume was completely a naturalist.
2190240	2194320	It says that Hume didn't carry out reductions.
2194320	2202000	And if he did carry them out, well,
2202000	2204400	maybe he would have tried the same kind of thing that Carnop
2204400	2209320	would have tried if he had had the same apparatus
2209320	2212560	in the way of logic.
2212560	2218000	And it seems to me most, as far as I know them,
2218000	2222440	traditional philosophers were.
2222440	2224320	But then there are these intrusions
2224320	2227680	of in one philosopher after another, of course,
2227680	2235080	partly with his divine intervention.
2235080	2238120	But if one philosopher such as himself
2238120	2242840	say that science is the only road to genuine knowledge,
2242840	2246360	naturalism is correct, another philosopher says,
2246360	2247200	I disagree.
2247200	2250800	I don't think that naturalism is correct.
2250800	2253920	Is there any way to settle the dispute?
2253960	2256160	Well, perhaps there's not.
2256160	2266840	Because it would seem that the other philosopher in this case
2266840	2279040	was not satisfied with empirical evidence
2279920	2284480	or was prepared rather to, I suppose
2284480	2285920	I should put the other way around,
2285920	2293640	that he was prepared to welcome the kind of evidence
2293640	2299840	that I couldn't admit because it doesn't persuade me,
2299840	2301960	because the kind of thing that would persuade me
2301960	2306960	would be at least the illusion of empirical evidence
2306960	2309040	in observation.
2309040	2311120	So that he's got something which I suspect
2311120	2314840	is just wrong turning and nonsense.
2314840	2316840	But in any event, of course, that's
2316840	2323440	taking a partisan position in this particular confrontation.
2323440	2332760	But to take a symmetrical approach here,
2332840	2338600	it would just be that inability on my part
2338600	2344520	to appreciate what he's counting as evidence is wrong.
2344520	2347080	You've distinguished between your naturalism
2347080	2349200	and your empiricism.
2349200	2350800	No.
2350800	2351800	No.
2351800	2353680	I thought that your empiricism, you
2353680	2358800	have taken to be itself an empirical doctrine which
2358800	2360680	flows out of your naturalism.
2360720	2363200	It's your naturalism which leads you to empiricism,
2363200	2366960	which leads you to the view that the checkpoints should
2366960	2370680	be observable data, but you could imagine it's
2370680	2376800	turning out that other sorts of data
2376800	2378320	should be taken into account.
2378320	2379520	Well, I don't think I can.
2379520	2383600	But I'm not getting the distinction between naturalism
2383600	2385040	and empiricism.
2385760	2392320	When, as I was explaining, my reason
2392320	2396760	for introducing that phrase, epistemology naturalized,
2396760	2399240	that was specifically for contrast
2399240	2407360	with Carnop's building up and the traditional epistemologist
2407360	2407960	before Carnop.
2407960	2410600	But Carnop was the one who came closest to actually building
2410600	2411520	it up.
2411520	2417160	Building up a phenomenal language in which science
2417160	2420440	was not expressed, and then getting a language
2420440	2425240	about the natural world, the physical world from that.
2425240	2430080	And I'm taking the other specifically, the other approach
2430080	2435600	and going into it from the standpoint
2435600	2438400	of the physical world.
2438400	2442440	They already accepted ontology itself.
2451400	2454200	As far as I can see, the alternative that you're
2454200	2459400	picturing would just be the sort of thing
2459400	2464920	that I'm picturing, someone who is claiming
2464920	2470200	a kind of mystical, or to me anyway,
2470200	2476640	mysterious, source of evidence or kind of evidence
2476640	2479920	that I can't appreciate and that doesn't move me.
2479920	2483840	And it might be a mystical, in some extreme case,
2483840	2489440	a mystical insight on the part of some guru in the Himalayas.
2489440	2492440	I think it's in pursuit of truth.
2492440	2496640	You say that empiricism is itself an empirical doctrine
2496640	2500360	as part of the web of belief, and might have to be abandoned.
2500360	2503920	If it turned out, for example, that there was much more
2503920	2510160	to clairvoyance or telepathy than we presently think,
2510160	2512240	we would be led away from the view
2512240	2515480	that the only reasonable checkpoints for scientific theory
2515480	2518520	are observable data, and we have to accept
2518520	2519840	some other checkpoints.
2519840	2520320	Oh, good.
2520320	2523920	Maybe we'd even have to accept divine revelation.
2523920	2524720	Good.
2524720	2527360	Yeah.
2527360	2529040	So let's see where this leaves us.
2532080	2534440	I do think it's an empirical doctrine,
2534440	2537320	I mean a scientific doctrine coming out of science,
2537320	2539680	in that science tells us there are only
2539680	2543720	avenue of evidences through our senses
2543720	2549200	by the impact of physical objects and forces.
2552120	2557960	And furthermore, that we might get evidence to the contrary,
2557960	2561600	and it would be still evidence of the kind that does count for me,
2561600	2564160	because it would be observable evidence.
2564160	2570160	And I can well imagine evidence for clairvoyance
2570160	2576480	just in the prediction of observable events, where
2576480	2581240	I couldn't see what empirical basis, in terms of known
2581240	2585920	scientific forces, could have brought this about.
2585920	2591480	And that would entail a revision not only of empiricism.
2595120	2596680	Well, would it?
2596720	2601600	Maybe we're getting a bifurcation here.
2606040	2606760	What about that?
2610280	2613800	It makes me wonder whether perhaps there's
2613800	2624840	some difficulty in empiricism on the, yes,
2624840	2626080	I think this is the trouble.
2629520	2635920	Perhaps we should say that empiricism goes on,
2635920	2640840	because I'm still settling only for corroboration
2640840	2643840	in the observations.
2643840	2647680	Yes, good, good.
2647680	2652280	But what goes by the board is the doctrine
2652280	2657640	that the input is just through the senses, at least
2657640	2660920	through the senses that we've so thus far enumerated.
2660920	2663680	And good.
2667840	2670880	Well, I think the moral of this, this
2670880	2678760	may be to have second thoughts about the statement
2678760	2683440	that empiricism is a scientific result.
2686200	2687720	Yes, that's good.
2687720	2688440	That's interesting.
2695240	2698120	Perhaps you've already answered this question
2698120	2699320	and what you just said.
2699320	2704160	But I wanted to ask you about which prominent philosophers
2704160	2710120	in the 20th century you would say are clearly not
2710120	2711560	sympathetic to naturalism.
2711560	2715320	Don't endorse naturalism, as you see it.
2718400	2720280	Well, I wonder.
2720280	2723040	Certainly the ordinary language philosophers of England
2723040	2726320	are naturalistic, as one could wish.
2726320	2729720	It's the other extreme, whatever philosophers
2729760	2736080	there are who are religious apologists,
2736080	2745320	trying still to support notions of revelation
2745320	2747000	would be an example to the contrary.
2747000	2751440	Those are clear cases, both ends, I'd say.
2751440	2754240	And then in between, what I would think of
2754240	2761960	is just the philosophers who are still
2761960	2764000	reluctant, even though not coming through
2764000	2768840	with epistemological reductions of the kind that
2768840	2772280	current up in the off-bau is undertaking.
2772280	2775720	Something that's never been taken up so far as I know
2775720	2779080	and pursued any further or could be.
2779120	2786520	But still are dissatisfied with the naturalization
2786520	2789400	of epistemology, in that they apparently still
2789400	2791560	feel that there's a problem there.
2791560	2797240	And this would be a negative kind still of non-naturalism.
2797240	2803200	There's a question about where naturalism leaves one
2803200	2805960	with respect to the issue of what is philosophy.
2810080	2813760	One possibility that you have endorsed
2813760	2818160	is that we think of philosophy as part of natural science.
2821040	2822480	There are other possibilities.
2822480	2825880	One might think that philosophy is simply
2825880	2829400	discredited as a possible enterprise.
2829400	2834280	Or one might think that philosophy, perhaps
2834280	2835680	with Wittgenstein, the philosophy
2835680	2838200	doesn't really aim at knowledge,
2838240	2841600	but as a therapeutic endeavor.
2841600	2844480	Is there any particular reason for picking
2844480	2846800	your characterization of philosophy?
2846800	2852040	No, that's not the characterization I intend.
2852040	2854040	I may occasionally say things that
2854040	2858160	sound very much like that, or even exactly like that.
2858160	2862920	But what I mean is philosophy is continuous with science.
2862920	2865560	My philosophy is continuous with science.
2865560	2867560	I can say that because that follows
2867560	2869120	from the fact that my philosophy, at least,
2869120	2871760	is continuous with science and it's part of philosophy.
2874520	2876960	And it may still be that, and I think it is,
2876960	2879120	that my philosophy is more continuous with science
2879120	2882720	than it is with some other parts of philosophy.
2882720	2887000	And I don't think of this sort of thing,
2887000	2888320	the scientific sort of philosophy,
2888320	2890320	as being the whole of philosophy.
2890320	2892840	There are other parts of philosophy, even, that I respect.
2892840	2894080	Ethics.
2894640	2897840	And of course, my position is that
2897840	2902840	judgments of moral value, and likewise aesthetic value,
2904520	2909520	are not part of science, except the anthropology
2909960	2910880	behind them is.
2917640	2919400	So I think a philosophy is quite a
2919680	2924680	quite a scattered, quite an aggregate whole.
2927480	2931040	And I should add, I think of furthermore,
2931040	2935720	even rather sympathetically, of English ordinary
2935720	2939040	language philosophy as being philosophy.
2939040	2941160	It's just that it's not enough of it.
2945080	2949040	I wanted to ask a question about Peter Strossen's paper,
2949080	2952520	two conceptions of philosophy and the contrast
2952520	2955480	between his naturalism and your naturalism.
2957080	2959920	In that paper, Strossen says,
2959920	2961680	what's this alternative conception?
2961680	2963560	In other words, what's his conception of philosophy?
2963560	2966200	Well, he says, the common as distinct
2966200	2969440	from the scientific understanding is a complicated affair,
2969440	2973800	embracing an indefinitely large range of ideas or concepts.
2973800	2978120	He gives a long list of concepts and then says,
2978120	2980080	the philosophical aim of those who adhere
2980080	2982040	to my alternative conception of philosophy,
2982040	2985360	I take to be that of elucidating the character
2985360	2989200	of such concepts as these and their interconnections.
2990520	2992760	What do you make of this alternative conception
2992760	2995480	of philosophy and how does it differ from yours?
2995480	2997560	It's narrower.
2997560	3000880	Yes, I would count this as decidedly as philosophy.
3000880	3004360	And in fact, it seems to me it's the,
3005280	3007440	well, it's of a piece
3007440	3010880	with the English Ordinary Language Philosophy.
3010880	3013000	These concepts, you list,
3013000	3015440	aren't very ordinary language, of course,
3015440	3019000	but on the other hand, they're also not symbolic logic.
3020040	3021560	And it's of a piece with that.
3021560	3023280	And I think it's all philosophy.
3023280	3028280	And it's even a lot, I think it's useful.
3028280	3033280	I think it probably turns out to be very largely true even.
3038240	3039560	But I wouldn't limit it to that
3039560	3042280	because I think there are,
3043640	3047080	well, a lot more that goes on that interests me
3047080	3049640	in my part of philosophy that doesn't come under that head,
3049640	3051720	not analysis of concepts.
3053400	3058000	But, well, naturalized epistemology
3058040	3058880	is one thing.
3061000	3066000	And then all such ventures are fruitful or not as
3076000	3080840	trying to get a more economical ontology
3082800	3087800	such contortions as getting a better understanding
3088480	3092120	of bodies identified with portions of space-time
3092120	3093680	and then portions of space-time in turn
3093680	3098680	with the classes of quadruples of numbers.
3100680	3102560	That's, I think, inside the philosophy.
3102560	3107560	And it's not analysis of concepts.
3107800	3110240	Doesn't seem in quite the same sense, anyway.
3110240	3111560	It's the kind of thing that would be regarded
3111560	3116000	as further extension in an unaccustomed direction
3116000	3118280	of natural science.
3120440	3122240	One of the things that Strossen stresses
3122240	3124880	is the interconnections between concepts.
3124880	3127800	And sometimes he speaks of this in terms of
3127800	3130280	plotting the contours of a conceptual scheme.
3131280	3134440	Part of what this involves is not just listing
3134440	3136120	a whole lot of things that we do,
3136120	3138440	but trying to identify, in some sense,
3138440	3141440	though not, I think, a scientific sense, particularly,
3141440	3142840	what's basic about what we do.
3142840	3144560	And so, for example, Strossen says
3144560	3147040	that material bodies are basic particulars,
3147040	3148800	not in the sense that they're basic for science,
3148800	3151680	but in the sense that identification
3151680	3154400	of material bodies, he says, is basic.
3154400	3156800	Identification of other kinds of objects
3156800	3159680	depends upon identification of material bodies
3159680	3160840	and not conversely.
3160840	3162240	So he argues.
3162240	3164080	Do you think there's any good prospect
3164080	3167240	for theoretical results of this kind in philosophy?
3167240	3170080	Yes, this does sound good to me.
3171080	3176080	And it's interesting, in particular,
3177440	3182360	perhaps as an extension,
3182360	3185360	and what seems to be an increasingly serious extension
3185360	3187680	of ordinary language philosophy,
3187680	3190480	where what is really coming into consideration
3190480	3194040	is the structure of ordinary language,
3194040	3199040	and not the structure in the linguist sense,
3199040	3204040	but the conceptual structure of our whole ordinary
3205160	3207360	and even extra ordinary, even scientific,
3208520	3209720	conception of the world.
3210800	3215800	And again, very much a part of what I regard
3218880	3221040	as philosophy and useful,
3221040	3225720	and as conspicuously continuous with science.
3226680	3227960	Paul asked earlier about
3227960	3230600	whether naturalism could be justified,
3230600	3233400	perhaps within the naturalist camp.
3233400	3234920	There are these different projects.
3234920	3236920	I wonder how one or other of those
3236920	3238760	might be chosen ahead of the other.
3238760	3241480	Strossen himself says of the two conceptions,
3241480	3244440	each has its own worth, he says, and its own appeal.
3244440	3245960	The choice between them is ultimately,
3245960	3248920	perhaps, a matter of individual temperament.
3248920	3250120	Do you think that's right?
3250120	3255120	The choice of them for what?
3259400	3261760	One can very well choose music instead of,
3263760	3268760	without casting aspersions on philosophy,
3270560	3272560	you can choose music instead,
3272560	3276340	and one can do fiction instead of science.
3277340	3282340	I think of the insistence on observation
3284500	3288700	as the checkpoint, insofar as any checkpoint can be,
3292900	3297900	can exist for what deserves the name of science.
3300900	3303060	And although a great deal of what deserves
3303100	3306980	the name of science can't be checked,
3308300	3309980	directly or indirectly, I claim,
3310940	3314060	still, when it is checked, it's going to be checked that way.
3316020	3320060	And I think of this not as something to establish,
3321300	3325820	but what distinguishes that scientific endeavor.
3325820	3327780	Now, how would anybody want to do that?
3328660	3333660	There, of course, there are two frequent reasons.
3335020	3340020	One is technology, and the other is
3341260	3343620	just intellectual curiosity.
3345060	3346460	I suppose the question, partly,
3346460	3350260	is how large a role science is going to play
3350260	3352380	in one's intellectual life.
3354220	3356300	Strawson, in effect, takes up the question
3356340	3360260	that you've just asked, the question, for what?
3360260	3362860	And he says, for one content to lead his life,
3362860	3364580	at least his intellectual life,
3364580	3366620	in the rarefied atmosphere of science,
3366620	3369500	the choice on this test will go one way.
3369500	3372660	For one content to lead his intellectual life
3372660	3376140	in the muddier atmosphere of the more mundane,
3376140	3377380	it will go the other way.
3378900	3380700	Does that seem to you to be the key,
3380700	3382740	whether one has a taste for the rarefied
3382740	3384940	or a taste for the muddier?
3384940	3387140	Well, I'm wondering just what the other way is,
3387140	3388700	in this case, what he has in mind.
3388700	3391260	He just had in mind what he calls
3391260	3395660	the more liberal or Catholic conception of philosophy.
3395660	3398820	Well, I think maybe he's a shift
3398820	3401260	to a more liberal or Catholic conception of science,
3401260	3404420	and he wouldn't find the discrepancy.
3405340	3408900	Made it sound as if naturalism consisted
3408900	3413780	in your being prepared to call science
3413780	3417460	the only things that were subject
3417460	3420020	to the checkpoint of observation.
3420020	3424260	And that makes the doctrine sound somewhat terminological.
3424260	3427180	So it makes the doctrine sound as if it's just about
3427180	3428820	what you are going to call science,
3428820	3430420	and what you are not going to call science,
3430420	3433580	and who cares about terminology.
3435060	3438060	No, I don't think that is a naturalistic position.
3438380	3439220	I see.
3442780	3447780	I just think of that as the distinguishing trait
3450740	3454460	of anything that any of us would think of as science
3454460	3457100	in the broadest sense, including history,
3458660	3463260	that if there is a checkpoint, it's there.
3463260	3467820	And on the other hand, I wouldn't expect one
3467860	3472060	to call something science if the checkpoints
3472060	3477060	were supernatural, the alleged checkpoints.
3480340	3485340	Do you think, is this closer to what your naturalism
3485900	3490900	consists in, that one simply ought to believe things
3492340	3497340	that haven't been subject to these things
3498820	3503820	that aren't subject to those observational checkpoints?
3505900	3510900	No, no, on the contrary, I hold that a great deal
3513100	3518100	of what's in science, the broad sense of this broad sense
3519740	3522140	has no checkpoint, direct or indirect,
3522140	3527140	and is still valuable, and valuable for science itself
3527220	3529660	and indirectly for prediction, but very indirectly,
3529660	3533500	namely as suggesting for further filling out
3534380	3537620	some more hypotheses, which, unlike those first ones,
3537620	3540580	do link up indirectly, systematically,
3540580	3545580	with critical masses that can as whole apply observations.
3548380	3553140	And I think that science would be very severely impoverished
3553820	3558820	if the evenly, most liberal sort of positivism
3563100	3564180	were put into effect.
3565220	3567620	But all these things fit into the web of belief
3567620	3570540	in one way or another, all the things that you think
3570540	3572300	should be, could be believed.
3573580	3575580	So I don't insist on checkpoints.
3575580	3578860	All I am assisting on here is negative,
3578860	3583300	namely, no checkpoints except observation.
3586740	3588460	Where do that leave ethics?
3590080	3595080	Out of science, but in philosophy,
3596660	3599020	and in respectable philosophy.
3599020	3602300	And in what we might legitimately believe,
3602300	3603540	doctrines.
3603540	3606540	Well, in another sense of believe, yes.
3607540	3611340	It has been noted by many philosophers yourself included
3611340	3613780	that there are points of contact between your thinking
3613780	3616420	and that of American pragmatism.
3616420	3619540	explicitly mentioned, for example, in the Dewey lecture,
3619540	3621860	some agreements you have with Dewey.
3621860	3625660	To what extent was pragmatism an actual influence on you?
3628540	3632260	I think, well, it's hard to think of any.
3632260	3633340	It's hard to think of any.
3633340	3635740	And I haven't been clear of my own mind
3635740	3638300	on what constitutes pragmatism
3638300	3643300	and what separates it from epistemology, from empiricism.
3643980	3648980	I've thought about various tenets
3649420	3652500	held by various card-carrying pragmatists,
3652500	3657500	James, Dewey, Perce.
3660340	3665340	And they seem to be far enough from each other.
3666500	3671340	At least as far from one another
3671340	3676340	as any of them from some non-pragmatists,
3677700	3681340	as far as they're usually classified.
3685220	3688820	So I've never considered myself a pragmatist.
3688820	3692780	And that's where that misleading paragraph
3692820	3696340	at the end of Two Dogs was makes all the difference.
3696340	3698780	Where I'm picking up Carnop's phrase
3698780	3701620	that he applied to his frameworks
3701620	3703340	as being purely pragmatic,
3703340	3708340	unlike the rest of science, which is empirical.
3710060	3713540	And where I say, well, yes, I agree with Carnop
3713540	3718540	about the character of what he's calling the framework.
3718660	3720940	Of what he's calling the framework,
3720940	3724380	but of course I'm questioning the difference
3724380	3726460	between the framework and the rest of science.
3726460	3728980	And I'm saying that it's just that my pragmatism
3728980	3732340	is more through or going, I would apply it across the board.
3732340	3737260	But that's, as it turned out, was an unfortunate way
3737260	3741420	of putting it, I was just using his word.
3742260	3744900	I have a post of pragmatism, it's just that I've wondered
3744900	3747060	just what is distinctive about it.
3747060	3751300	And so I've never considered myself a pragmatist.
3753060	3755620	You mentioned Carnop's notion of framework.
3755620	3757500	One difference between you and Carnop
3757500	3761100	that come over and over again in various guises in the years
3761100	3763260	is your attitude toward natural language
3763260	3765100	as opposed to constructed language.
3765100	3767860	Carnop almost never wants to deal with natural language.
3769500	3772260	He always wants to define his notions
3772260	3774460	only for constructed languages,
3774460	3777140	where you always seem to want to pull him back
3777140	3780420	into consideration of what languages people actually speak.
3780420	3783620	Yes, yes, because I think of those constructions
3783620	3788620	as superstructures for one or another particular,
3789180	3791780	generally local, temporary purpose.
3793540	3798540	And I think of axiom or postulate as a,
3798820	3803820	in effect an indexical indicator word,
3805820	3808420	namely something relative to the particular project
3808420	3811580	of pedagogy that one's engaged in.
3811580	3814020	Here's the way he's organizing this law
3814020	3817780	that he wants the reader to master.
3818660	3819900	He's putting it in this order
3819900	3822020	and deducing these from those.
3822020	3823780	Somebody might find an even more efficient way
3823780	3825820	of doing it the other end too,
3825820	3829240	and that there's nothing intrinsic about those things.
3829240	3832140	The artificial language,
3834100	3837100	of course, if one thinks primarily
3837100	3838340	in terms of artificial languages,
3838340	3841540	then there's no problem about analyticity,
3841540	3845240	that what's analytic is the axioms and their consequences.
3847620	3850340	So what is the point of artificial language?
3850340	3853460	Well, it depends, of course, on what it's used for,
3853460	3858460	but at one point I presented this artificial example,
3867340	3870380	a positivist, a logical positivist named Ixman.
3872420	3875340	I thought of that now.
3876340	3881340	Ixman is making some point about the meaning
3881500	3883860	of some metaphysics in which he,
3886540	3891540	some metaphysical, these things are meaningless,
3891700	3896140	and his argument is that you could have all of science
3897140	3899180	and all of our predictions and everything
3899180	3902140	without any of these metaphysical questions even coming in.
3903060	3906300	And to show this, at least with some examples,
3906300	3909980	he says, imagine a tribe,
3912300	3916980	a tribe of Martians who speak a language
3916980	3918380	of the following sort,
3918380	3921980	and then he sets up an artificial language.
3921980	3926980	He has to tell us a good deal about the syntax
3927940	3930420	and vocabulary, but just certain parts,
3930420	3932260	just the parts that are gonna make his point
3932260	3934380	at the point of this particular metaphysical sentence
3934380	3938660	that he's taking the props out from under.
3941420	3944860	So he lays down these particular traits of the language,
3944860	3945780	whenever these things,
3945780	3947580	there are these sentences when these are true,
3947580	3952580	these are true, and that's all he needs to make his point.
3954140	3956100	All right, there's an artificial language,
3956100	3957900	and there's a perfectly clear sense
3957900	3959740	in which we can say what's analytic and what isn't,
3959740	3961100	what's in the framework,
3961100	3963900	and what is empirical outside the framework,
3963900	3966020	namely what Ixman has laid down.
3967060	3970380	But what was the significance of his laying it down?
3970380	3971220	Well, in this example,
3971220	3972980	we know exactly what the significance was,
3972980	3974940	and it doesn't throw any light
3974940	3977860	on a more general notion of analytic.
3977860	3980140	And it's this sort of consideration
3980140	3983780	that has made me
3987620	3991900	empirical in my approach
3991900	3996900	or my criticism of these semantical notions.
4000500	4004660	Besides your naturalism or empiricism,
4004660	4006460	perhaps they're the same thing,
4006460	4010740	you've singled out as central doctrines of your philosophy,
4012180	4015180	what you call your extensionalism,
4015180	4018700	and also your skepticism about meaning.
4018700	4021060	Could you tell us something about what these doctrines are
4021060	4023300	and how they relate to one another?
4023300	4028300	Well, essentialism is what's involved in saying that
4030580	4035580	classes that have the same members,
4037140	4039900	everything that's true of a class
4039900	4044900	is true of a class that has the same members as that class.
4046500	4047460	In that sense, therefore,
4047460	4049140	they are just one class, not two.
4050940	4055940	And that's extensionalism,
4056940	4060660	the core of it, that's the law of extensionality.
4062100	4066540	In an extensional language,
4068980	4072900	any two predicates are interchangeable
4072900	4076260	without, if they are true of the same objects,
4076260	4078380	interchangeable without disturbing the truth value
4078380	4080180	of the sentence in which they occur.
4081180	4086180	So that for an extensional language,
4087820	4090220	therefore, there's no difference
4090220	4092260	between a property and a class.
4092260	4097260	Properties are identical for such a theory,
4097500	4100580	such a language, if and only if they have the same,
4100580	4103180	if and only if they're true of the same things.
4103180	4106220	Therefore, you might as well call them classes, and I do.
4106220	4108980	And thus, I don't recognize properties.
4111180	4116180	Well, that's really the whole of essentialism.
4119860	4124420	But when, good Lord, I mean of extensionalism,
4126020	4130620	but an important consequence of it is
4130620	4135620	that there's no difficulty in an extensionalist language
4136420	4138220	or an extensional language,
4139140	4143780	we can say, no problem about the
4144780	4146300	substitutivity of identity.
4146300	4151300	That is to say that if two terms are names of the same thing,
4153700	4156700	two singular terms are names of the same thing
4156700	4161460	and nothing else, you can put one for the other
4161460	4162580	in any context anywhere,
4162580	4166060	and again, the truth will be undisturbed.
4168780	4173780	It's hard to make sense really of that law failing
4174820	4177180	if the things really are identical.
4177180	4182180	But when you get away from extensional context,
4182860	4186980	that does seem continuously to be threatened.
4186980	4191780	And that's one of the practical virtues
4192940	4197740	of trying to maintain a completely extensional theory.
4199220	4204220	Could you explain how this extensionalist position,
4206740	4211220	denial are any properties over and above classes?
4211220	4214380	How that relates to your skepticism about meaning?
4216140	4217980	It relates in this way.
4218820	4221780	It's not enough to warrant the skepticism,
4221780	4223700	not in itself altogether,
4223700	4225060	but it does relate in this way
4225060	4227980	that pretty good that are two of the same things,
4227980	4230220	still may or may not have the same meaning.
4233700	4238300	So it's a, so sameness of meaning
4239260	4240900	is a distinction that goes beyond
4243540	4246500	sameness of extension,
4246500	4249180	sameness of objects denoted.
4250020	4254300	I wanted to ask about properties in the fully
4254340	4258460	austere ontology where we just have classes
4258460	4261180	of four tuples of real numbers.
4261180	4264580	Well, there properties as traditionally conceived
4264580	4268060	aren't recognized, but then nor are I suppose
4268060	4271860	tables and mountains fuzzy blurred objects
4271860	4274380	as normally conceived recognized.
4274380	4276980	But still I sense that you're more sympathetic
4276980	4280460	to tables and mountains than you are to properties.
4280460	4281380	One of you would say why?
4282220	4287220	Yes, one has to settle for their fuzziness
4289020	4293700	since all empirically learned terms are vague
4293700	4295700	that way on their edges at least.
4297780	4299620	And we can't do without them.
4299620	4302940	And the way I'm inclined to accommodate them,
4302940	4307940	however, is by taking as my theoretical ontology
4308700	4313460	objects that are not fuzzy.
4313460	4318460	And it would mean that any of indefinitely many
4324420	4326580	distinct from one another,
4326580	4331580	mutually distinct bodies, real bodies could be
4338940	4341820	identified with that table.
4345020	4347580	It would make no difference in all applications
4347580	4349100	of our scientific theory.
4349100	4351460	But from the theoretical point of view,
4351460	4353420	we would consider ourselves to be talking about
4353420	4356260	one of that multitude and not all of them.
4357900	4360740	Well, as for properties, I can understand
4360740	4364100	the antipathy to properties particularly
4364100	4367700	if properties are seen as related to extensions
4368540	4372220	as sense to reference using Frager's terminology
4372220	4375260	because properties would come under the scope
4375260	4377660	of skepticism about meaning in that case.
4377660	4379580	What about the alternative conception of properties
4379580	4381060	where properties are thought of as lying
4381060	4385220	in between a fragrance sense and extension?
4387020	4390860	How do you feel about admitting those to your ontology?
4390860	4392020	No, I'm against it.
4392020	4395180	My objection is again,
4395220	4399660	I'm just over the principle of individuation,
4399660	4404660	of what I would want would be an explanation of clear one,
4407260	4412260	of just when to say of property A and property B
4412580	4415380	in that sense that they're the same property.
4417020	4419060	And you're skeptical about that.
4419060	4420300	I don't know any way to do it.
4421300	4425620	I'm supposing the scientists were more certain
4425620	4429500	that they needed properties than they were of any account
4429500	4431220	they could offer you just now
4431220	4433980	of the individuation conditions for properties.
4433980	4436020	And so they just set that as a research project.
4436020	4437900	Would that be an okay way to proceed?
4439140	4442500	Yes, it would, it would.
4443660	4445780	And it seems to be the way people do proceed.
4445780	4451100	Well, it would, yes, in order to proceed that way,
4451100	4453380	of course, they would have to be thinking
4453380	4457860	in terms of the particular, to me very mysterious,
4457860	4461180	situations where they felt they couldn't do without them.
4461180	4463820	And then that's what they'd be doing
4463820	4466220	in their continuing investigation.
4466220	4470300	That would be to try to sharpen,
4470300	4475300	define some concept that would serve
4475700	4478660	that purpose and that could be appropriately
4478660	4480060	then be called properties.
4481620	4484460	The situation could be worse still.
4487980	4491140	The familiar situation in, of course,
4491140	4494020	in theoretical physics, notably,
4494020	4497980	is to introduce a new term for a technical purpose
4497980	4501780	without giving any definition at all, any clear definition.
4502780	4506220	The names for the elementary particles
4506220	4508220	without exception are in that status.
4508220	4509740	They're not defined.
4509740	4513580	We're told a lot of things about them enough
4513580	4515340	so that one can get on.
4515340	4520340	And conceivably, if there was something
4520340	4523420	that might appropriately be called properties
4523420	4525700	that seem to be needed in science,
4525700	4527660	they might even be brought in that way.
4527660	4529300	And we would learn to put up with them
4529300	4531420	by mastering all the things
4531420	4534260	that can usefully be said about them,
4534260	4537180	even though everyone was at a loss to define them.
4537180	4541220	That I'd, I'd face it, that would be, of course,
4542700	4545020	what one always wishes for something clearer
4545020	4546460	and more elegant, but you,
4546460	4551460	but nature gets in there sometimes and prevents it.
4551500	4553100	I wonder whether there'd be another point
4553100	4555180	at which properties might need to come in.
4555180	4560180	Those who see events as the terms in causal relations
4560340	4563020	are often driven to say something a little bit more,
4563020	4565780	which is that some of the properties of an event
4565780	4568380	are causally efficacious, as it's said,
4568380	4570100	other properties of the event not.
4570100	4571700	And just to be able to say that,
4571700	4573620	on the face of it seems to be a matter
4573620	4575220	of quantifying over properties.
4575220	4577980	Yes, well, the way I handle that one
4577980	4582620	is that I take the events as extensional.
4582660	4587660	And in fact, I do, in general,
4588780	4593140	think of a physical object as the,
4593140	4597780	in the most general sense, as the content
4597780	4600340	of some portion of space-time.
4600340	4602060	It needn't be a continuous portion at all.
4602060	4603740	It could be scattered.
4603740	4606980	It could be sugar, for instance,
4606980	4610900	of, as an object for me,
4610900	4613700	is a single physical object.
4613700	4617580	It's all the sugar in the world, past, present, future.
4619940	4621740	Or, of course, one could equally just identify it
4621740	4624820	with the portion of space-time that it takes up.
4625700	4628140	That's purely a verbal difference at this point,
4628140	4628980	it seems to me.
4631100	4634860	And I think of events as physical objects,
4634860	4637940	in that sense, and as extensional.
4637940	4641500	And then the question arises that the question is you raised.
4641500	4644740	Here you have an event of,
4650100	4653740	well, let's see, I remember Davidson had an example
4653740	4656700	that brought this out.
4657620	4660540	If I could, here's some sort of a contrivance
4660540	4661380	that's
4662380	4663380	of
4667300	4670540	rotating, that's right, a heating up.
4670540	4678540	And the heating up causes a bit of ice to melt
4678540	4684780	and the immediate environment, as we say,
4684780	4686300	the heating up caused that.
4686300	4688900	There's the property in a broad sense.
4692380	4697500	But the heating up, in this case, and the rotating,
4697500	4701140	are inseparable.
4705300	4712260	And so what I would say is, yes, so far as this,
4712260	4718300	that although it's strange, strange usage,
4718300	4721900	and after all, I'm not doing philosophy of ordinary language,
4721900	4727300	but rather I prefer to be doing these things
4727300	4730500	in the spirit of mathematicians who will bring in new symbols
4730500	4735900	and new terms just in order to clarify what they're doing
4735900	4738700	or make it simpler and easier to follow.
4740180	4745700	And as far as I can see, it would fit all the purposes
4745700	4750780	of science to make the following unidiomatic departure
4750780	4757300	and say that, yes, that time, the spinning melted the ice.
4759620	4765220	The spinning of the event, the spinning of that wheel
4765220	4769620	melted the ice because the heating of the wheel
4769620	4775060	and the spinning of the wheel were both what the wheel was
4775060	4777700	doing, was the state of the wheel.
4777700	4783620	No harm because the fact remains that our general law,
4783620	4791460	that nearby heating melts ice, stands,
4791460	4796780	and there's no suggestion of a law that some nearby spinning
4796780	4799340	melts ice.
4799340	4802220	I suppose you'd be unlucky if all the spinnings were
4802220	4804500	heating and all the heatings were spinning.
4807500	4811100	Yes, well, that would pose a problem which scientists
4811100	4816860	would be eager to get into, just why is that, but quite.
4816860	4819220	So you're not inclined to go down the path of saying
4819220	4823380	that the heating which is a spinning, on this occasion,
4823380	4827700	causes the ice to melt, causes quay heating the ice to melt,
4827700	4830300	although it doesn't cause quay spinning the ice to melt.
4830300	4832060	That's the point we should appeal to some, I think.
4832060	4835780	Yes, well, that was all to some, I can imagine.
4835780	4843180	Oh, yes, so that would be a good day-to-day vernacular way
4843180	4845980	of doing it, despite of the non-vernacular status of quay.
4851780	4856380	But I wouldn't, because that brings in concepts
4856380	4859500	that I don't think we need and that I find
4859500	4860780	it clear to avoid.
4864060	4867340	I'm going to quit while I'm at it, I think.
4867340	4871660	About ontology, you share with Carnap
4871660	4875300	certain basic predilection for wanting
4875300	4877420	to rob certain questions of their force.
4877420	4882140	For example, the question, what is an ordered pair really?
4882140	4885620	Now, Carnap, one of, I think, his main motivation
4885620	4888860	is to make sure that those sorts of questions don't make sense.
4888900	4891260	And he has this elaborate notion of framework
4891260	4893460	and what's in a framework, what's outside a framework that
4893460	4895420	does that work for him.
4895420	4897420	So how do you rob that kind of question?
4897420	4900020	Well, I think I'd agree with Carnap, not framework.
4900020	4903420	No, but that's right, but I would agree with his conclusion.
4908100	4914180	I think the trouble with this is that we're using a term that
4914180	4918060	hasn't been sufficiently, it hasn't been either defined
4918060	4922140	or sufficiently described, to cover the particular circumstance
4922140	4926540	that we're questioning, so that in that sense,
4926540	4930220	it's a meaningless question.
4930220	4933820	But as you've said, there is no entity without identity,
4933820	4937180	so you have to do something.
4937180	4940060	Yes, but which entity is it?
4941060	4948740	Of course, that begs the question again,
4948740	4953100	but I don't see how there's any dodging that one.
4953100	4958500	The ordered pair can be defined serviceably
4958500	4961580	in any number of ways.
4961580	4967020	And there are several ways that have come into the literature,
4967020	4969380	and it doesn't matter which ones you use,
4969420	4975180	just so you can prove the basic law of the ordered pair.
4975180	4979660	That x, y is identical with z, w if and only if x
4979660	4983100	is identical with z and y with w.
4983100	4989740	And so for practical purposes, the meaning of ordered pair
4989740	4992060	is just that.
4992060	4998420	And then in order for the sake of it,
4998420	5002140	and commonly, we can leave it at that in practice and do.
5002140	5004220	And there's a corresponding situation,
5004220	5007140	well-known in the case of saying what numbers are,
5007140	5012540	what the positive integers are, of different ways of doing it,
5012540	5015540	all of which are perfectly good, and it doesn't matter which.
5021340	5025540	And then there are two ways of looking at that situation,
5025540	5029380	in both the case of the pair and the numbers.
5029380	5032500	Namely, one way is, yes, here we've
5032500	5035700	got this ambiguous term ordered pair,
5035700	5038780	or the many kinds of ordered pair.
5038780	5042020	But I think that philosophically, the more straightforward way
5042020	5046180	is, in this case, elimination.
5046180	5050700	And say, now we've shown, here we've defined ordered pair.
5050700	5051940	We're shown we're not going to need
5051940	5054140	to assume, as an irreducible notion,
5054140	5056380	the notion of ordered pair, because we've
5056380	5060660	got other notions here, which, if we put them together
5060660	5063180	in the right combination, we'll do the same trick.
5063180	5064140	So let's do that.
5064140	5065620	And there are no such things as pairs.
5065620	5066780	Do the same thing about numbers.
5066780	5070780	There are no such things as the positive integers.
5070780	5072740	We're just talking about these sets.
5072740	5077860	But then it's awkward to keep, we need a name, a short name,
5077860	5084100	for these little constructions that we are serving as stand-ins.
5084820	5086540	For the pair.
5086540	5090740	And so what better name, since we've already
5090740	5092300	freed the term ordered pair.
5092300	5093660	It doesn't refer to anything anymore.
5093660	5094980	Those are gone.
5094980	5095980	Let's reuse it.
5095980	5097340	It's another kind of economy.
5100860	5105020	So that's the way I suggest looking at these situations.
5110020	5112020	Is there, do you see any relationship
5112020	5114060	between the particular situation one
5114060	5117340	is in here, and thinking about what numbers are
5117340	5120860	or what an ordered pair is, and your general doctrine
5120860	5124100	of ontological relativity?
5124100	5128060	That's, yeah, interesting thought.
5128060	5128560	I hadn't.
5134220	5135780	Well, yes, yes.
5135780	5140020	Yes, there certainly is in very broad terms.
5140020	5142780	The point about ontological relativity
5142780	5151780	was that there are certain functions,
5151780	5157140	tagging functions, you might say, which
5157140	5161860	are various so-called objects we're performing.
5161860	5165620	But serving, really, as far as the logical structure
5165620	5169980	or even the empirical support and checkpoints
5169980	5176860	of our theory is concerned, mirror nodes
5176860	5178100	in the logical structure.
5186380	5191060	We can reshuffle these objects, put in any others that
5191060	5192660	are in one one correlation with them.
5192660	5194380	They deserve that purpose just as well.
5196620	5206580	And so if we had some systematic way of naming these nodes,
5206580	5209580	neutral names, we could just put those in
5209580	5212460	and just get rid of all these other names for objects.
5212460	5217900	However, we have no systematic way of naming those nodes.
5217900	5221460	The only thing we do is name them in our unsystematic way.
5221460	5224780	And so we have these various terms for these various objects.
5224780	5228300	And we talk about rabbits and this and that.
5228300	5231900	But in talking about rabbits, cats, et cetera,
5231900	5242540	we might just as well be talking about cat compliments
5242540	5244620	and rabbit compliments and the like.
5244620	5247900	So there's good parallel.
5247900	5251660	Would the following, though, be something of a difference?
5251700	5255940	In my own language, of course, using my own language,
5255940	5257900	I can't use any other one.
5257900	5260580	And I can think to myself, well, I
5260580	5266580	wonder whether the number one is such and such a set
5266580	5270540	or whether it is such and such a different set.
5270540	5274340	Which of these identity statements should I believe?
5274340	5277420	And it seems to me to be a genuine question.
5278420	5285620	But if I contrast that with the question,
5285620	5293140	I wonder whether my word or my linguistic expression,
5293140	5300140	the number one, really does refer to the number one.
5300140	5303500	That doesn't seem in the same way as if it could be
5303500	5307020	a genuine question for me.
5307020	5315940	It seems a trivial matter of what the word refers to means
5315940	5322740	that my expression, the number one, does, for me,
5322740	5324660	pick out the number one.
5324660	5327420	Well, but then that raises the question
5327420	5331060	in that refers to the number one and what sense of number one.
5337060	5339740	In the case of abstract objects like the number one,
5339740	5344780	that seems to me that ontological relativity doesn't even
5344780	5348020	it doesn't even need to seem counterintuitive.
5348020	5356300	Frege, I seem to remember, raised the question or mentioned
5356300	5360820	the question, or the possibility, what is the number one?
5360820	5362740	It could be Julius Caesar.
5362740	5364380	Doesn't matter.
5365380	5370100	He went at least that far into ontological relativity.
5370100	5373980	And oh, and then Ramsey with his,
5373980	5378300	what have come since his day to be called Ramsey sentences,
5378300	5380500	rather brings out that point, again, for abstract objects.
5386140	5389180	It seems fairly intuitive that even
5389180	5393380	that abstract objects are brought in there just
5393380	5399540	as stopping points or to bring things together.
5403620	5405180	It wouldn't matter.
5405180	5406420	Well, of course, we know it.
5406420	5409100	It doesn't matter how we go on and artificially
5409100	5415500	define these numbers as long as we get the behavior out of them,
5415500	5423740	the properties that make them useful in application.
5423740	5426060	And formerly, those properties are just
5426060	5430420	the properties of a regression, a sequence
5430420	5432060	of the kind called a progression.
5432060	5445460	But there's an example that we use of two physicists
5445460	5451580	who at a time out, did I have to do this before?
5451580	5454980	I know I mentioned it, but I'm not sure I did it,
5454980	5456980	about the neutrino and the physicists.
5456980	5457780	I know you didn't.
5457780	5458980	Good.
5458980	5464740	Well, yes, this, I think, brings out some of the spirit of it.
5464740	5469620	There's a crisis in physics, and something
5469620	5472820	has to be done in revising the theory or supplementing it.
5472900	5477140	And one physicist suggested maybe we
5477140	5478220	needed a new particle.
5478220	5482180	In fact, two physicists arrived at that idea
5482180	5485620	of introducing a new particle with certain properties
5485620	5491820	that will help clear up the paradox.
5491820	5499020	And one of them brings in a particle that has some rest mass,
5499020	5502300	and the other one brings in a particle that has no rest mass.
5502300	5506180	But they both apply the same word, neutrino.
5506180	5508620	And it seems to me it presents no problem
5508620	5512820	to say that there's clearly no meaning to the question
5512820	5516660	whether, A, they are talking about the same particle,
5516660	5521860	but disagree in its properties, or B,
5521860	5523500	they're talking about different particles.
5523500	5525540	One has a rest mass, the other hasn't,
5525540	5528700	but they happen to have given it the same name.
5528700	5530060	No difference.
5530060	5534700	And well, I think that applies, again,
5534700	5539180	to the example of the numbers, yes, the numbers,
5539180	5543020	and to the example of the ordered pairs,
5543020	5549020	that one has certain services that,
5549020	5552660	in case the ordered pair is, I think, particularly
5552660	5555620	conspicuous this way, because ordered pair isn't even
5555620	5559420	a common sense notion to the extent that 1, 2, 3 are.
5559460	5564580	And all that's wanted is something
5564580	5572020	that is going to carry the individuality of both x and y,
5572020	5574740	and not vice versa.
5574740	5577540	And some further entity, then, in addition
5577540	5580740	to the x and the y, anything will do.
5580740	5582900	And then they cast it out and find, yeah,
5582900	5586980	here's something it'll do.
5586980	5588380	There's a little class of two members
5588420	5591180	that's easy to describe.
5591180	5592900	Not just the class of the members x and y,
5592900	5595700	but a little more complicated.
5595700	5597660	Someone else comes up with an equally simple one,
5597660	5600420	but a different one, and that's a situation
5600420	5602020	where it doesn't matter.
5602020	5604340	You have this function, that function
5604340	5607860	in the sense of service, not in the mathematical sense,
5607860	5613660	to be performed, and anything will do in the pinch.
5613660	5616860	And then the sweeping theory, finally,
5617420	5620180	of ontological relativity is that that's
5620180	5621180	the way with all reference.
5624380	5631540	But what makes it, I'd say, counter-intuitive to all of us
5631540	5633780	is when it's not a question of abstract objects anymore,
5633780	5642220	like ordered pairs and numbers, but sensible objects.
5643100	5654140	So this is where one has to consider, and keep in mind,
5654140	5658180	that the sensory associations are undisturbed
5658180	5660780	in all this reshuffling of objects
5660780	5665740	in the course of ontological relativity,
5665740	5671100	one-to-one reinterpretations.
5671540	5673900	The sensory connotations remain.
5673900	5682420	And when a body ends up being identified or supplanted,
5682420	5690660	as you prefer, either way, by a class of quadruples of numbers,
5690660	5693580	the sensory qualities of that body,
5693580	5696220	the qualities by which you learned it
5696220	5698860	through ostention or whatever, carry over
5698860	5704460	to that class of quadruples of numbers.
5710180	5714100	So it's a matter of shifting one's emphasis
5714100	5719260	from the object to the sentence, ultimately
5719260	5721980	to the observation sentences, as far as their objects
5721980	5725340	that we've learned by ostention, objects whose names we've
5725340	5727900	learned by ostention.
5727900	5730260	And those go along unaffected.
5730260	5736140	And what the theory of ontological relativity
5736140	5745780	brings out is just that really the entity, the object hood,
5745780	5753580	the object hood is not really what matters here.
5753820	5758140	Two things that do matter are, one,
5758140	5762900	all this bundle of sensory qualities
5762900	5766140	to put the thing in mentalistic terms,
5766140	5769580	all the association when it comes to a neural league
5769580	5773660	with the sensory input.
5773660	5776540	That's one of the two things that matter.
5776540	5780620	And the other thing that matters is the role it plays,
5780620	5787580	the service it performs as a node in the theoretical structure,
5787580	5790260	the logical structure of the scientific theory.
5790260	5792980	And then what the thesis of ontological relativity
5792980	5796500	brings out is these are two separate purposes
5796500	5802900	and can be separated, even be separated ontologically,
5802900	5806100	in that the ontology can be reshuffled at will
5806100	5809060	to within one to one for the one.
5809060	5816660	And on the other hand, the sensory input stays put.
5816660	5821340	In your long career as a teacher and professor,
5821340	5825620	you must have encountered a great number of students
5825620	5829100	who have gone on some within philosophy
5829100	5833220	and some outside of philosophy to pursue careers.
5833220	5835940	Does anyone in particular, or do any of them in particular,
5835940	5838340	stand out in your mind as?
5838340	5839260	Oh, yes, indeed.
5839260	5849700	Of course, of the earlier ones, Donald Davidson,
5849700	5865020	then in logic, there have been a few, certainly not so much
5865020	5868100	of my students who have gone successfully
5868100	5870380	into computer theory and the like.
5870380	5880340	But philosophers, later generations,
5880340	5885460	of course, I think of Doug Finfield Estelle and Roger
5885460	5893260	Gibson, I'm mentioning ones that have gone on,
5893260	5897340	carrying on more or less my point of view.
