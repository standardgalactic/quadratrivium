00:00.000 --> 00:10.800
Professor Warren Goldfab, chairman of the philosophy department

00:10.800 --> 00:15.240
at Harvard University, is our guest panelist in this program.

00:15.240 --> 00:17.520
He specializes in logic, history of logic,

00:17.520 --> 00:20.920
and philosophy of mathematics, and has translated and edited

00:20.920 --> 00:24.080
the logical writings of Jacques Herbrand.

00:24.080 --> 00:26.840
He has also coauthored with Bertrand Reben the decision

00:26.840 --> 00:32.200
problem in solvable classes of quantificational formulae.

00:32.200 --> 00:34.440
The program begins with a discussion of Professor

00:34.440 --> 00:37.360
Quine's early philosophical career at Harvard

00:37.360 --> 00:39.440
and consideration of his relationship

00:39.440 --> 00:42.040
with the logical positivists of the Vienna circle,

00:42.040 --> 00:45.360
most notably with Rudolf Carnat.

00:45.360 --> 00:48.080
This background sets the stage for a thorough discussion

00:48.080 --> 00:50.640
of Quine's naturalism, and in particular,

00:50.640 --> 00:53.480
his naturalized epistemology.

00:53.480 --> 00:55.960
Questions about the famous two dogmas are raised,

00:55.960 --> 00:59.200
and then attention is drawn to his doctrines of extensionalism

00:59.200 --> 01:02.040
and ontological relativity.

01:02.040 --> 01:06.800
We now join the discussion in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

01:06.800 --> 01:10.560
Joining Professor Quine for this discussion are Warren Goldfab,

01:10.560 --> 01:13.480
professor of philosophy at Harvard University,

01:13.480 --> 01:17.040
Paul Horwich, professor of philosophy at MIT,

01:17.040 --> 01:20.000
and Martin Davies, wild reader in mental philosophy

01:20.000 --> 01:21.080
at Oxford University.

01:21.600 --> 01:29.560
In 1932, the Quine set sail for Europe destination was Vienna.

01:29.560 --> 01:34.080
Herbert Feigl, who was at Harvard University from Vienna

01:34.080 --> 01:38.720
at that time, had suggested to Quine, who had already

01:38.720 --> 01:43.040
achieved acclaim as a logician, that the main action in logic

01:43.040 --> 01:47.800
would be found in Vienna, and perhaps in the person of Rudolf

01:47.840 --> 01:51.040
Carnat, who was ultimately to play a great role in Quine's

01:51.040 --> 01:52.000
development as a philosopher.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.160
Before going into the influence that the Vienna circle had

01:58.160 --> 02:03.040
on your work, I'd like to ask you, what was the situation at

02:03.040 --> 02:06.200
Harvard at that time, particularly in the field of logic?

02:09.200 --> 02:14.640
At that time, logic was very weakened in America generally.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.880
As far as I know, hardly any of them taught the subject.

02:20.880 --> 02:26.800
Harvard was looked to, prided itself on being perhaps

02:26.800 --> 02:31.200
the greatest center for logic in America.

02:34.360 --> 02:38.280
After I'd been there for a little while,

02:38.280 --> 02:39.880
I'd been there for a little while,

02:40.880 --> 02:44.760
after I'd been there for a little while,

02:44.760 --> 02:48.200
I came to feel that this was, well,

02:48.200 --> 02:52.440
this profession reminded me of the Wizard of Oz.

02:57.640 --> 03:01.480
I was learning virtually no logic that I hadn't already

03:01.480 --> 03:07.040
imbibed as an undergraduate from my unsupervised honors

03:07.040 --> 03:07.540
reading.

03:10.880 --> 03:12.800
Pardon.

03:12.800 --> 03:15.520
Who were the main characters at that time at Harvard?

03:18.320 --> 03:23.240
In logic, the three names associated with logic were

03:23.240 --> 03:28.960
Whitehead, Clarence Serving Lewis, and Harry Sheffer.

03:28.960 --> 03:32.480
Whitehead, of course, with a very good reason,

03:32.480 --> 03:36.320
because he and Bertrand Russell had done this monumental three

03:36.320 --> 03:41.400
volume work on mathematical logic, the work that

03:41.400 --> 03:44.480
was far and away the greatest thing in that subject,

03:44.480 --> 03:47.160
and virtually the only great thing

03:47.160 --> 03:49.640
that I'd become aware of up to then.

03:54.600 --> 03:56.800
Lewis had done many years earlier.

03:56.800 --> 04:00.280
In fact, as far back as 1918, the book

04:00.280 --> 04:05.600
had appeared a survey of symbolic logic

04:05.640 --> 04:15.200
in which he did a good job of reporting the developments

04:15.200 --> 04:19.600
at the hands of Burs and Boulle and the others,

04:19.600 --> 04:22.360
and some small extent, perhaps, Fraga.

04:25.520 --> 04:29.800
His teaching, he was perhaps my most influential teacher,

04:29.800 --> 04:34.560
from a point of view of straight classroom contact.

04:34.600 --> 04:36.440
His course in Kant, and his course

04:36.440 --> 04:38.120
in his own theory of knowledge.

04:42.160 --> 04:43.240
He wasn't teaching logic.

04:46.120 --> 04:50.280
What little logic I associated with him from reading,

04:50.280 --> 04:52.400
I was not sympathetic with, because it was modal logic.

04:52.400 --> 04:56.040
In fact, he was very much the pioneer, the American pioneer

04:56.040 --> 05:00.800
in, or the pioneer, I should say, in the modal logic

05:00.800 --> 05:01.480
of necessity.

05:04.920 --> 05:09.160
Harry Shuffer was the one who was giving logic courses,

05:09.160 --> 05:13.640
but they were just altogether too thin.

05:16.360 --> 05:25.280
And there was no inkling of the current excitement

05:25.280 --> 05:32.320
in Central Europe at the hands of Tarski and Łukasziewicz

05:32.760 --> 05:38.320
and others in Poland, and Hilbert Ackermann Bernice

05:38.320 --> 05:41.000
in Germany, got it again.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.760
So you met Karnath in Europe in 1932,

05:45.760 --> 05:48.920
and you clearly found he had a lot to offer.

05:48.920 --> 05:51.280
In 1934, you gave a series of lectures

05:51.280 --> 05:54.240
on his program of logical syntax.

05:54.240 --> 05:57.640
Those lectures are very sympathetic to him,

05:57.640 --> 05:59.480
but pretty soon you found yourself

05:59.520 --> 06:03.800
having some differences with that program and with Karnath.

06:03.800 --> 06:07.840
Let's know, where did you first find your differences with Karnath?

06:07.840 --> 06:11.160
What were the initial difficulties you first

06:11.160 --> 06:13.920
found yourself running into in thinking about executing

06:13.920 --> 06:14.480
the program?

06:14.480 --> 06:16.520
Yes.

06:16.520 --> 06:19.360
The first occasion, apparently, and I

06:19.360 --> 06:22.880
didn't learn this until just within the past few years,

06:22.880 --> 06:28.240
was as far back as March 1933, when I was there with Karnath

06:28.240 --> 06:34.760
and was getting so much stimulation and knowledge

06:34.760 --> 06:36.760
of philosophy from him.

06:40.120 --> 06:42.480
I didn't know that until it was turned up by Neil Tennant

06:42.480 --> 06:48.160
and a log that Karnath had kept in his methodical way,

06:48.160 --> 06:57.640
where day after day in Prague, when he wasn't going into lecture,

06:57.640 --> 07:04.760
I would go out to where he lived and we would discuss,

07:04.760 --> 07:08.600
because I was reading his logical syntax of language

07:08.600 --> 07:11.080
in the German edition.

07:11.080 --> 07:13.760
As it came out of the typewriter, it hadn't yet appeared.

07:13.760 --> 07:15.080
It wasn't to appear for another year.

07:18.560 --> 07:22.600
Karnath entered in this log that I had expressed questions

07:22.600 --> 07:27.720
about the analyticity, some doubt about it.

07:27.720 --> 07:30.040
And his reflection was that perhaps I

07:30.040 --> 07:34.400
was right in thinking, I'm not sure how accurately I

07:34.400 --> 07:36.760
remember this three or four line passage,

07:36.760 --> 07:39.000
but perhaps I was right in thinking

07:39.000 --> 07:50.200
that it was a matter of degree, until this recent archaeological

07:50.240 --> 07:52.560
discovery.

07:52.560 --> 07:58.400
I thought of 1935, when I was writing Truth by Convention,

07:58.400 --> 08:04.000
that came out in 36 for a festrift for Whitehead,

08:04.000 --> 08:08.120
as being my first manifestation, certainly, of that doubt.

08:08.120 --> 08:24.440
And certainly by 39, 40, it had become really quite a firm doubt

08:24.440 --> 08:27.040
and not just a tentative misgivings.

08:32.160 --> 08:37.440
I'd like to ask you about your attitude towards the positivist

08:37.440 --> 08:43.520
doctrine that metaphysics is meaningless in discussing

08:43.520 --> 08:48.000
the so-called inverted spectrum hypothesis,

08:48.000 --> 08:50.960
a hypothesis that, for all I know,

08:50.960 --> 08:53.000
other people are seeing red things the way

08:53.000 --> 08:55.840
I see green things in vice versa.

08:55.840 --> 08:59.000
In reaction to that, you said you thought

08:59.000 --> 09:03.240
this hypothesis would be unverifiable and therefore

09:03.240 --> 09:04.720
meaningless.

09:04.720 --> 09:07.680
And this sounds exactly the sort of thing

09:07.680 --> 09:12.600
that the hard-line positivist would have said.

09:12.600 --> 09:14.800
Does this show that you are, in fact,

09:14.800 --> 09:17.600
a hard-line positivist in this respect?

09:17.600 --> 09:18.280
No, I can agree.

09:18.280 --> 09:21.400
This is exactly what the hard-line positivist would have said.

09:21.400 --> 09:25.520
I wouldn't say it or I wouldn't mean that anyway.

09:25.520 --> 09:28.880
What I perhaps said, perhaps I started

09:28.880 --> 09:32.920
out saying that for one thing, it's unverifiable.

09:32.920 --> 09:37.160
And then I should have gone on to say, whether I did or not,

09:37.160 --> 09:42.440
that I can't even see how, by connecting it up

09:42.440 --> 09:47.000
with other hypotheses, getting it into the network

09:47.000 --> 09:52.680
of the web of belief, that it would link up indirectly

09:52.680 --> 09:59.200
with verification, that it seemed to be simply inaccessible

09:59.200 --> 10:05.040
to scientific developments that we can project,

10:05.040 --> 10:07.240
that we can imagine and foresee.

10:07.240 --> 10:10.000
And that, it seems to me, should qualify something

10:10.000 --> 10:15.600
that purports to be a statement or a question of fact

10:15.600 --> 10:21.920
as meaningless in the positivist way.

10:21.960 --> 10:24.800
So you do countenance, then, a class

10:24.800 --> 10:34.400
of meaningless, unverifiable, metaphysical sentences.

10:34.400 --> 10:35.880
Yes, yes.

10:35.880 --> 10:43.200
But it's way out, as I think it feels this is,

10:43.200 --> 10:51.880
because I don't even consider it necessary for meaningfulness.

10:51.880 --> 10:56.160
That a sentence be indirectly connectable

10:56.160 --> 11:03.960
with observation, that it be part of a network.

11:03.960 --> 11:07.440
I wouldn't require that the sentence be indirectly

11:07.440 --> 11:09.120
verifiable in this sense.

11:09.120 --> 11:16.120
That there be a set of sentences which together have

11:16.120 --> 11:17.680
what I've called critical mass.

11:17.680 --> 11:25.720
And that they together will imply an observationally

11:25.720 --> 11:32.600
testable situation and would include the sentence

11:32.600 --> 11:36.560
in question and would lose its critical mass

11:36.560 --> 11:38.760
if, when that was removed from the class,

11:38.760 --> 11:44.040
that would be a way of explaining what it would mean,

11:44.040 --> 11:48.160
perhaps for a sentence to have empirical content at all

11:48.160 --> 11:53.640
that would share empirical content in this essential way.

11:53.640 --> 11:55.400
I wouldn't insist on that by any means.

11:55.400 --> 12:00.440
And I don't think that the bulk of sentences in history

12:00.440 --> 12:03.480
or perhaps in various social sciences,

12:03.480 --> 12:09.920
nor perhaps all of them even in serious rigorous physics

12:09.920 --> 12:12.320
meet even that test.

12:12.320 --> 12:15.400
And I don't think that for that reason,

12:15.400 --> 12:17.680
they should be rejected as meaningless.

12:17.680 --> 12:27.360
Because they are sentences that we have postulated or accepted.

12:27.360 --> 12:32.240
That is, we've conjectured them, accepted them,

12:32.240 --> 12:34.800
because they seem to fit in so nicely

12:34.800 --> 12:36.800
with the theory that is working.

12:36.800 --> 12:38.600
Perhaps considerations of symmetry,

12:38.600 --> 12:43.320
perhaps it seems to fill a nice little conceptual gap.

12:43.320 --> 12:44.560
And I think that furthermore, they

12:44.560 --> 12:49.200
can be vital to the progress of science,

12:49.200 --> 12:55.720
because they are, I imagine, a very important, maybe

12:55.720 --> 13:01.640
overwhelmingly large part of the heuristics

13:01.640 --> 13:07.480
of the fashioning of worthwhile scientific hypotheses.

13:07.480 --> 13:11.400
That is to say, hypotheses that are worth testing,

13:11.400 --> 13:13.080
rather than desperately erring away one's time

13:13.080 --> 13:17.760
on hypotheses that we ought to have thought

13:17.760 --> 13:22.000
were very unlikely to come out right when tested.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.760
So I think that's a vital part of science.

13:24.760 --> 13:28.400
And in fact, it's because of, including all these,

13:28.400 --> 13:36.800
that I can't envision any sharp demarcation.

13:36.800 --> 13:43.280
I'm with Carl Popper in this, between science and metaphysics

13:43.280 --> 13:48.280
in the in the primitive sense.

13:48.280 --> 13:50.480
That does raise a question, though.

13:50.480 --> 13:53.800
The positivists were very fond of demarcation criteria,

13:53.800 --> 13:58.640
not just to separate science from metaphysics,

13:58.640 --> 14:02.120
but also to separate science from pseudoscience.

14:02.120 --> 14:04.520
So the question is, how would you handle a question in which

14:04.520 --> 14:07.480
someone might want to bring into question something,

14:07.480 --> 14:10.560
for example, like psychoanalytic theory,

14:10.560 --> 14:14.000
as to whether that really had scientific status or not.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.720
The positivists would handle such a question

14:15.720 --> 14:17.840
by their general criteria.

14:17.840 --> 14:20.160
How would you handle such a question?

14:20.160 --> 14:25.480
Yes, well, I think the effect that that consideration has on me

14:25.480 --> 14:32.480
is rather that I'm very suspicious of it and dubious of it.

14:32.520 --> 14:35.960
I can conceive that it might be helpful in some of the suggestions,

14:35.960 --> 14:38.200
some of the things, perhaps some of the things that are said

14:38.200 --> 14:43.000
about dreams or some of the things that are said about inhibitions

14:43.000 --> 14:44.920
from earlier experiences, this way,

14:44.920 --> 14:53.320
that can inspire somebody with a more scientific temper

14:53.320 --> 14:57.400
to some constructive ideas that will go on.

14:57.400 --> 14:58.920
Maybe it's already happened.

14:59.920 --> 15:02.880
But the sort of culture is developed

15:02.880 --> 15:09.640
and the trust that's been put into it as something therapeutic

15:09.640 --> 15:15.200
and worth spending an awful lot of time and money treating oneself

15:15.200 --> 15:18.840
to, that makes the thing certainly a great evil.

15:18.840 --> 15:21.600
And I'm not sympathetic with it at all.

15:21.600 --> 15:29.520
But I think to this extent, it's more nearly continuous

15:29.520 --> 15:36.040
with science than it should be for me to be single-mindedly

15:36.040 --> 15:38.440
inclined to brand it as meaningless.

15:41.320 --> 15:46.080
The critics of verificationism used to devise sentences

15:46.080 --> 15:49.960
which were apparently meaningful but which were cooked up in such a way

15:50.000 --> 15:53.080
as not to be susceptible of empirical confirmation

15:53.080 --> 15:55.240
or falsification either.

15:55.240 --> 15:57.200
I seem to recall some sentence along the lines

15:57.200 --> 15:59.640
of there's a planet for whose existence

15:59.640 --> 16:02.080
we shall never have any evidence.

16:02.080 --> 16:05.000
Would you want to say the same about those sentences

16:05.000 --> 16:09.280
as you say about sentences in the outer reaches of mathematics,

16:09.280 --> 16:15.160
which is that overall simplicity can be our only guide?

16:15.160 --> 16:19.600
No, I think the situation isn't as clear with those sentences

16:19.600 --> 16:25.760
because those sentences might be related in the way

16:25.760 --> 16:33.560
that I was sketching through these various systematic kinships

16:33.560 --> 16:37.760
to such sentences so as to be valuable in the theory

16:37.760 --> 16:43.080
that they're fitting into the web of belief in such a way

16:43.080 --> 16:49.440
as to seem very likely to belong.

16:50.440 --> 16:56.160
Well, in a way, those sentences of higher mathematics

16:56.160 --> 17:00.520
have that too in one direction, namely they are results

17:00.520 --> 17:05.040
of simply continuing to apply and extrapolate the grammar

17:05.040 --> 17:09.480
and lexicon that we've been needing for scientific purposes.

17:09.480 --> 17:17.440
And that's a very clear and unconjectural link that they have.

17:17.440 --> 17:20.640
And it's the only reason, my only reason,

17:20.640 --> 17:23.760
for taking them seriously as a part of science.

17:28.360 --> 17:32.360
So I think a detailed structural connection is different.

17:32.360 --> 17:36.040
What about the idea of taking the inverted spectrum

17:36.040 --> 17:39.240
hypothesis or its negation as just being a sentence

17:39.240 --> 17:42.760
in the outer reaches of phenomenology, where once again

17:42.760 --> 17:45.040
we'd say, well, we are allowed to be meaningful

17:45.040 --> 17:47.520
because it's just using over again vocabulary

17:47.520 --> 17:51.040
that we use in more workaday circumstances.

17:51.040 --> 17:54.480
And we'll once again just let the truth value fall where it may

17:54.480 --> 17:56.560
in light of overall simplicity, I guess,

17:56.560 --> 17:58.160
in which case you'd go for the denial

17:58.160 --> 18:00.440
of the inverted spectrum hypothesis.

18:00.440 --> 18:03.960
Yes, well, that's an interesting suggestion

18:03.960 --> 18:08.800
because I was about to wonder, all right,

18:08.800 --> 18:12.560
if we admit it, which way is our decision going to go on?

18:12.560 --> 18:13.320
That's truth value.

18:17.920 --> 18:21.960
People wonder about the outer reaches of mathematics as well.

18:21.960 --> 18:23.840
Well, there we can settle for simplicity.

18:23.840 --> 18:29.240
I can't see simplicity coming into the act, in this case,

18:29.240 --> 18:32.440
which is a commentary also on how independent it

18:32.440 --> 18:36.120
seems to be from anything scientific.

18:36.120 --> 18:38.440
I wonder if you recognize a class of sentences

18:38.440 --> 18:41.480
that are meaningless in a more definitive way

18:41.520 --> 18:46.400
than simply not seeming to have any empirical consequences

18:46.400 --> 18:50.080
or the possibility of any fitting into the web of belief.

18:50.080 --> 18:54.880
I have in mind Wittgenstein's example.

18:54.880 --> 18:57.760
It is five o'clock on the sun.

18:57.760 --> 18:58.240
Oh, good.

18:58.240 --> 19:04.920
Where it looks as though, although grammatically OK,

19:04.920 --> 19:08.160
how one feels like saying, well, five o'clock

19:08.160 --> 19:09.640
hasn't been defined for the sun.

19:09.640 --> 19:11.160
It doesn't make any sense to us,

19:11.160 --> 19:13.600
whether it's five o'clock on the sun.

19:13.600 --> 19:16.240
What's your reaction to kind of set?

19:21.240 --> 19:23.640
Well, a characteristic of this kind of example, I suppose,

19:23.640 --> 19:32.680
is that we can prove on the basis of principles

19:32.680 --> 19:37.000
that we all, unhesitatingly, accept anyway, I should think,

19:37.000 --> 19:46.880
that there couldn't be any criterion or any criterion

19:46.880 --> 19:52.200
that would fit in usefully with the rest of science

19:52.200 --> 19:53.880
in which those same terms are used.

19:57.120 --> 19:59.720
Maybe it's just the virtue of this.

19:59.720 --> 20:01.680
If it is a virtue, it's a clear case.

20:01.680 --> 20:02.160
I see.

20:03.160 --> 20:08.760
We've been talking about some of the historical influences

20:08.760 --> 20:13.920
on you, just about Karnap, who does seem to have been predominant.

20:13.920 --> 20:17.600
But there was one very centrally influential book

20:17.600 --> 20:21.440
on all of the philosophers of the inner circle, not just Karnap.

20:21.440 --> 20:23.360
And that was Wittgenstein's Tractatus.

20:23.360 --> 20:26.240
They all read it quite numerous times,

20:26.240 --> 20:28.880
and it clearly impacted all of their work.

20:28.920 --> 20:33.200
Did it have any direct effects on you and in your work?

20:33.200 --> 20:35.840
I'm not aware of us having had any positive effect.

20:35.840 --> 20:37.920
I didn't like it.

20:37.920 --> 20:39.640
I read it early.

20:39.640 --> 20:40.560
I can't think how early.

20:45.480 --> 20:49.200
Very likely, already, when I was a graduate student there in 31,

20:49.200 --> 20:57.600
32, although not in the course, no, I didn't like it.

20:57.640 --> 21:00.920
I didn't like the absoluteness of his atomism.

21:03.600 --> 21:10.240
Also, of course, I was put off somewhat

21:10.240 --> 21:17.600
by his being so blithe about construing quantification

21:17.600 --> 21:21.320
as just the infinite case of truth functions.

21:21.320 --> 21:25.200
The analogy is important, but I guess I

21:25.240 --> 21:30.080
may have felt at the time any way that he wasn't taking

21:30.080 --> 21:35.040
the difficulties of actually acting on this

21:35.040 --> 21:36.080
into consideration.

21:36.080 --> 21:39.200
Wasn't appreciating.

21:39.200 --> 21:42.200
Also, it seemed to me that his treatment of number

21:42.200 --> 21:49.640
in terms of relations was untidy.

21:49.640 --> 21:53.800
And I couldn't see why it wasn't clearly so inferior

21:53.800 --> 21:56.960
to the much simpler definition of number

21:56.960 --> 22:03.280
that Russell had already given, which followed Frege.

22:03.280 --> 22:06.880
So it was a bit much later work that I found more sympathetic.

22:14.120 --> 22:18.200
The two dogmas that you reject in your article,

22:18.200 --> 22:25.600
two dogmas of empiricism, are the analytic, synthetic

22:25.600 --> 22:29.360
distinction, the distinction between matters of statements

22:29.360 --> 22:31.600
that are true in virtue of their meanings alone,

22:31.600 --> 22:35.280
statements that are true in virtue of the facts,

22:35.280 --> 22:39.000
and the other dogma is reductionism,

22:39.000 --> 22:41.400
the idea that every meaningful sentence

22:41.400 --> 22:44.760
has its own empirical content can

22:44.760 --> 22:49.920
be reduced to observational facts in one way or another.

22:49.920 --> 22:53.600
I wanted to ask you about the relationship

22:53.600 --> 22:59.600
between your criticisms of these two doctrines.

22:59.600 --> 23:07.680
In particular, does your critique, your rejection

23:07.680 --> 23:10.480
of the analytic, synthetic distinction

23:10.480 --> 23:13.320
play any role in the line of thought

23:13.320 --> 23:17.640
that takes you from the denial of reductionism

23:17.640 --> 23:21.560
to the web of belief, to your renunciation

23:21.560 --> 23:22.880
of a priori knowledge?

23:32.720 --> 23:38.840
My wholism was already present in two dogmas.

23:38.880 --> 23:47.400
In fact, in the two dogmas where everybody reads it,

23:47.400 --> 23:50.280
there's a footnote to duem.

23:53.200 --> 23:58.520
Actually, that footnote is misleading in that I didn't

23:58.520 --> 24:02.440
know anything about duem when I presented two dogmas

24:02.440 --> 24:07.360
as a lecture or when it first appeared as an article in January

24:07.360 --> 24:09.880
1951.

24:09.880 --> 24:15.080
And it was Peter Hemphill, that is, Carl G. Hemphill,

24:15.080 --> 24:20.560
and also independently, Philip Franck,

24:20.560 --> 24:29.520
who, having read that article, said how yes, that's like duem.

24:29.520 --> 24:32.480
And so I added that footnote when the thing was reprinted

24:32.480 --> 24:36.640
in from a logical point of view by way of giving duem credit.

24:37.320 --> 24:40.480
It seemed to be claiming this as something, some novel

24:40.480 --> 24:43.640
contributions, just a matter of presenting it

24:43.640 --> 24:47.120
as being the way things are.

24:47.120 --> 24:52.760
Anyway, so I had come to that somehow.

24:52.760 --> 24:59.280
And it's hard to say, it's not a very clean cut idea,

24:59.280 --> 25:02.640
somewhere along the line from Truth by Convention

25:02.640 --> 25:05.080
to Two Dogmas.

25:05.080 --> 25:08.920
And then, the Web of Belief, well,

25:08.920 --> 25:13.240
that was a very, I think, an admirable and catchy title

25:13.240 --> 25:16.880
due to my collaborator, Joe Ullian.

25:16.880 --> 25:18.360
But that's just more of the same.

25:24.920 --> 25:29.160
When I was writing Two Dogmas, I brought that in.

25:30.160 --> 25:34.480
And structurally, its position in that article

25:34.480 --> 25:38.920
is, as one possible consideration to help account

25:38.920 --> 25:43.920
for the rather strange fact that people take analyticity,

25:43.920 --> 25:47.320
even analyticity across the board the way they do,

25:47.320 --> 25:53.760
so uncritically, that there may be a failure to appreciate

25:53.760 --> 25:58.040
that reductionism won't do.

25:58.040 --> 25:59.680
Fail to appreciate wholism.

26:03.800 --> 26:09.440
As for whether it was this wholistic view that

26:09.440 --> 26:15.200
made me skeptical of analyticity in the first place,

26:15.200 --> 26:20.320
I just can't judge, because something

26:20.320 --> 26:23.840
like an appreciation of that can be

26:23.840 --> 26:28.840
vague and inarticulate enough so that it

26:28.840 --> 26:30.440
doesn't come out explicitly.

26:30.440 --> 26:32.760
And I had thought of it as such.

26:32.760 --> 26:38.960
It's the same, the two attitudes, the wholism,

26:38.960 --> 26:42.360
therefore, anti-reductionism in that particular instance

26:42.360 --> 26:44.240
of reduction.

26:44.240 --> 26:48.000
And the skepticism about meaning and analyticity

26:48.000 --> 26:51.600
are so much of a piece.

26:51.640 --> 26:55.440
Incidentally, that anti-reductionism

26:55.440 --> 26:57.640
has certainly caused misunderstandings,

26:57.640 --> 27:01.920
because I am not against reductionism as such,

27:01.920 --> 27:03.840
for heaven's sake.

27:03.840 --> 27:06.680
I'm very fond of it.

27:06.680 --> 27:09.720
More reduction, the better.

27:09.720 --> 27:14.560
And it's just this particular case of it.

27:14.560 --> 27:23.640
Could your line of thought, which involves rejecting

27:23.640 --> 27:28.600
the reductionism in this epistemological form,

27:28.600 --> 27:31.120
the reduction of any theoretical statement

27:31.120 --> 27:35.240
to observation statements, which goes from there

27:35.240 --> 27:39.520
to wholism and the web of belief and the rejection

27:39.520 --> 27:42.520
of a priori knowledge, could that

27:42.520 --> 27:49.280
proceed independently of any critique of analyticity?

27:49.280 --> 27:51.680
They're so closely mentioned, it's hard to say.

27:51.680 --> 27:59.960
But I think just because of the developing situation,

27:59.960 --> 28:07.640
the circumstances when these questions arose,

28:07.640 --> 28:16.040
it was certainly what I became clearly aware of was

28:16.040 --> 28:18.520
misgivings specifically over analyticity.

28:18.520 --> 28:22.480
That was because of the way Carnot was using it.

28:22.480 --> 28:26.480
But I thought of it, then, as an objection that,

28:26.480 --> 28:29.960
and still in two dogmas, I thought of it,

28:29.960 --> 28:35.480
as a matter of not having given a satisfactory definition

28:35.480 --> 28:38.400
of his terms, of his term analyticity.

28:42.640 --> 28:44.120
But the difficulty of doing so, then,

28:44.120 --> 28:50.320
is of a piece with the wholism.

28:50.320 --> 28:52.800
If he had managed to, or if someone

28:52.800 --> 28:56.600
had managed to give it a characterization of analyticity

28:56.600 --> 29:01.360
from which it would not follow that an analytic truth could

29:01.360 --> 29:05.440
be known a priori, then would that

29:05.880 --> 29:07.840
conception of analyticity have been

29:07.840 --> 29:13.240
able to play the philosophical role that it

29:13.240 --> 29:18.640
was being asked to play prior to two dogmas?

29:18.640 --> 29:22.080
I think it's something like the definition of analyticity

29:22.080 --> 29:24.800
that I propose in roots of reference.

29:24.800 --> 29:26.560
For example, yes.

29:26.560 --> 29:31.880
No, that's certainly unscathed.

29:31.920 --> 29:35.880
Just going back to two dogmas for a moment,

29:35.880 --> 29:38.200
Freddie Ayer cited you as being responsible,

29:38.200 --> 29:40.440
or partly responsible, for the dismantling

29:40.440 --> 29:44.080
of logical positivism because of your attack,

29:44.080 --> 29:47.920
your twin attacks on the analytic synthetic distinction

29:47.920 --> 29:50.360
and reductionism in that paper.

29:50.360 --> 29:54.640
And we've spoken privately a bit about Freddie Ayer

29:54.640 --> 29:57.400
and his position at that time when you met him,

29:57.400 --> 29:59.680
and subsequently, as you observed

29:59.720 --> 30:03.680
his philosophical connection to logical positivism

30:03.680 --> 30:05.560
and how it differed from your own.

30:05.560 --> 30:06.880
And you've expressed a willingness

30:06.880 --> 30:09.600
to say something about this.

30:09.600 --> 30:12.320
So would you tell us about that?

30:12.320 --> 30:18.600
Well, it seemed to me in his influential first book,

30:18.600 --> 30:26.240
Language, Truth, and Logic, he came out, interestingly,

30:26.280 --> 30:28.880
in between the two phases of Carnop

30:28.880 --> 30:34.920
that it seemed to me so abruptly different.

30:34.920 --> 30:37.880
The Carnop of the logisher Aufbau,

30:37.880 --> 30:41.520
where he was very much the phenomenalist,

30:41.520 --> 30:48.080
and the later Carnop, where he's a, well,

30:48.920 --> 30:59.000
I'd say he's taken on naturalism along more specifically

30:59.000 --> 31:01.760
with his physicalism.

31:01.760 --> 31:07.520
In fact, it eases the transition from the earlier

31:07.520 --> 31:10.840
Carnop to the later one and makes it more intelligible.

31:10.840 --> 31:17.240
I can't see quite how to pin it down

31:17.600 --> 31:18.720
in the way of specific points.

31:22.800 --> 31:25.400
The book was impressive to me.

31:25.400 --> 31:33.080
The way so much in philosophy came under his criticism.

31:33.080 --> 31:36.800
The book, from beginning to end, focuses primarily

31:36.800 --> 31:39.720
on meaninglessness of metaphysics,

31:39.720 --> 31:42.360
and one metaphysical, one philosophical,

31:42.360 --> 31:43.880
traditional philosophical question,

31:43.880 --> 31:45.480
or issue after another is taken up,

31:45.480 --> 31:53.880
and then he argues, shows how it is hopelessly

31:53.880 --> 31:56.160
unempirical and how it goes.

31:56.160 --> 32:00.480
And this is leading up, directs it well,

32:00.480 --> 32:09.600
and so this makes for a close continuity, again,

32:09.600 --> 32:13.920
between the Vienna circle of the later Carnop

32:13.920 --> 32:18.480
and the Wittgenstein of his days in England,

32:18.480 --> 32:21.360
where philosophy becomes, under Wittgenstein,

32:21.360 --> 32:27.640
a straight therapeutic undertaking,

32:27.640 --> 32:32.120
and philosophical problems are results

32:32.120 --> 32:33.880
of misuse of language that can be cured.

32:33.880 --> 32:42.520
And the point pointing out of just the way

32:42.520 --> 32:49.120
that air felt that language had gone wrong in these cases,

32:49.120 --> 32:51.960
sometimes is the way he handles the questions

32:51.960 --> 32:55.720
and showing them, showing that they're meaningless.

32:55.720 --> 32:57.960
And he certainly produced something

32:57.960 --> 33:02.760
that gives the spirit of the Vienna circle

33:02.760 --> 33:06.440
for the reader who runs.

33:06.440 --> 33:12.280
It's not intellectually exacting.

33:12.280 --> 33:20.200
It can be read and depreciated by wide circle and was.

33:23.200 --> 33:29.760
Very important point of view of the history

33:29.760 --> 33:34.280
and geography of philosophy.

33:34.280 --> 33:37.160
You've said that naturalism is one

33:37.160 --> 33:39.840
of the main components of your philosophy.

33:39.840 --> 33:42.080
That's the view, roughly speaking,

33:42.080 --> 33:48.280
that science is the only road to genuine knowledge.

33:48.280 --> 33:50.800
I'd like to ask you about this.

33:50.800 --> 33:54.360
Do you think that this naturalist doctrine

33:54.360 --> 33:57.400
can be established or in any way justified,

33:57.400 --> 33:59.600
or does it have to be a basic axiom?

34:05.000 --> 34:11.800
Well, no.

34:11.800 --> 34:14.640
I think perhaps the avenue has to be something like this,

34:14.640 --> 34:20.000
that you're engaged in science and have recognized

34:20.000 --> 34:27.080
what implicitly or explicitly that the checkpoints

34:27.080 --> 34:29.320
of science, insofar as they exist,

34:29.320 --> 34:33.920
are checkpoints in observation through that channel

34:33.920 --> 34:37.880
of applying the observational setup.

34:42.640 --> 34:48.120
And you appreciate that without considering

34:48.120 --> 34:51.040
that what doesn't submit to that test is meaningless.

34:51.040 --> 34:53.520
Of course, I've just been arguing against that point of view.

34:53.520 --> 34:57.880
But insofar as there is a check, that's what it is.

34:57.880 --> 35:03.120
And so this would make one critical of the transcendental

35:03.120 --> 35:08.480
intrusions, as if there were other sources,

35:08.480 --> 35:18.080
either in a priori knowledge of the human or divine revelation

35:18.120 --> 35:24.120
as a support underpinning for science and its method.

35:24.120 --> 35:32.960
But I feel that naturalism is and was very widespread.

35:32.960 --> 35:34.000
Nothing new about this.

35:34.000 --> 35:41.560
I adopted the term, introduced, I don't know which,

35:41.560 --> 35:46.200
naturalistic epistemology or epistemology naturalized

35:46.200 --> 35:49.880
for a specific application, namely,

35:49.880 --> 35:54.520
getting away from the notion of a phenomenalistic reduction

35:54.520 --> 36:01.320
of scientific concepts in order to endow them with meaning

36:01.320 --> 36:06.440
in favor of going at those questions from within,

36:06.440 --> 36:08.200
from within science itself.

36:08.200 --> 36:13.520
And this is certainly quite a clear and undistakeable

36:13.520 --> 36:19.440
contrast between my way of doing things and Carnop's

36:19.440 --> 36:23.520
Aufbau to take extreme case.

36:23.520 --> 36:27.080
But on the other hand, naturalistic philosophy,

36:27.080 --> 36:30.240
generally, it seems to me, Hume was completely a naturalist.

36:30.240 --> 36:34.320
It says that Hume didn't carry out reductions.

36:34.320 --> 36:42.000
And if he did carry them out, well,

36:42.000 --> 36:44.400
maybe he would have tried the same kind of thing that Carnop

36:44.400 --> 36:49.320
would have tried if he had had the same apparatus

36:49.320 --> 36:52.560
in the way of logic.

36:52.560 --> 36:58.000
And it seems to me most, as far as I know them,

36:58.000 --> 37:02.440
traditional philosophers were.

37:02.440 --> 37:04.320
But then there are these intrusions

37:04.320 --> 37:07.680
of in one philosopher after another, of course,

37:07.680 --> 37:15.080
partly with his divine intervention.

37:15.080 --> 37:18.120
But if one philosopher such as himself

37:18.120 --> 37:22.840
say that science is the only road to genuine knowledge,

37:22.840 --> 37:26.360
naturalism is correct, another philosopher says,

37:26.360 --> 37:27.200
I disagree.

37:27.200 --> 37:30.800
I don't think that naturalism is correct.

37:30.800 --> 37:33.920
Is there any way to settle the dispute?

37:33.960 --> 37:36.160
Well, perhaps there's not.

37:36.160 --> 37:46.840
Because it would seem that the other philosopher in this case

37:46.840 --> 37:59.040
was not satisfied with empirical evidence

37:59.920 --> 38:04.480
or was prepared rather to, I suppose

38:04.480 --> 38:05.920
I should put the other way around,

38:05.920 --> 38:13.640
that he was prepared to welcome the kind of evidence

38:13.640 --> 38:19.840
that I couldn't admit because it doesn't persuade me,

38:19.840 --> 38:21.960
because the kind of thing that would persuade me

38:21.960 --> 38:26.960
would be at least the illusion of empirical evidence

38:26.960 --> 38:29.040
in observation.

38:29.040 --> 38:31.120
So that he's got something which I suspect

38:31.120 --> 38:34.840
is just wrong turning and nonsense.

38:34.840 --> 38:36.840
But in any event, of course, that's

38:36.840 --> 38:43.440
taking a partisan position in this particular confrontation.

38:43.440 --> 38:52.760
But to take a symmetrical approach here,

38:52.840 --> 38:58.600
it would just be that inability on my part

38:58.600 --> 39:04.520
to appreciate what he's counting as evidence is wrong.

39:04.520 --> 39:07.080
You've distinguished between your naturalism

39:07.080 --> 39:09.200
and your empiricism.

39:09.200 --> 39:10.800
No.

39:10.800 --> 39:11.800
No.

39:11.800 --> 39:13.680
I thought that your empiricism, you

39:13.680 --> 39:18.800
have taken to be itself an empirical doctrine which

39:18.800 --> 39:20.680
flows out of your naturalism.

39:20.720 --> 39:23.200
It's your naturalism which leads you to empiricism,

39:23.200 --> 39:26.960
which leads you to the view that the checkpoints should

39:26.960 --> 39:30.680
be observable data, but you could imagine it's

39:30.680 --> 39:36.800
turning out that other sorts of data

39:36.800 --> 39:38.320
should be taken into account.

39:38.320 --> 39:39.520
Well, I don't think I can.

39:39.520 --> 39:43.600
But I'm not getting the distinction between naturalism

39:43.600 --> 39:45.040
and empiricism.

39:45.760 --> 39:52.320
When, as I was explaining, my reason

39:52.320 --> 39:56.760
for introducing that phrase, epistemology naturalized,

39:56.760 --> 39:59.240
that was specifically for contrast

39:59.240 --> 40:07.360
with Carnop's building up and the traditional epistemologist

40:07.360 --> 40:07.960
before Carnop.

40:07.960 --> 40:10.600
But Carnop was the one who came closest to actually building

40:10.600 --> 40:11.520
it up.

40:11.520 --> 40:17.160
Building up a phenomenal language in which science

40:17.160 --> 40:20.440
was not expressed, and then getting a language

40:20.440 --> 40:25.240
about the natural world, the physical world from that.

40:25.240 --> 40:30.080
And I'm taking the other specifically, the other approach

40:30.080 --> 40:35.600
and going into it from the standpoint

40:35.600 --> 40:38.400
of the physical world.

40:38.400 --> 40:42.440
They already accepted ontology itself.

40:51.400 --> 40:54.200
As far as I can see, the alternative that you're

40:54.200 --> 40:59.400
picturing would just be the sort of thing

40:59.400 --> 41:04.920
that I'm picturing, someone who is claiming

41:04.920 --> 41:10.200
a kind of mystical, or to me anyway,

41:10.200 --> 41:16.640
mysterious, source of evidence or kind of evidence

41:16.640 --> 41:19.920
that I can't appreciate and that doesn't move me.

41:19.920 --> 41:23.840
And it might be a mystical, in some extreme case,

41:23.840 --> 41:29.440
a mystical insight on the part of some guru in the Himalayas.

41:29.440 --> 41:32.440
I think it's in pursuit of truth.

41:32.440 --> 41:36.640
You say that empiricism is itself an empirical doctrine

41:36.640 --> 41:40.360
as part of the web of belief, and might have to be abandoned.

41:40.360 --> 41:43.920
If it turned out, for example, that there was much more

41:43.920 --> 41:50.160
to clairvoyance or telepathy than we presently think,

41:50.160 --> 41:52.240
we would be led away from the view

41:52.240 --> 41:55.480
that the only reasonable checkpoints for scientific theory

41:55.480 --> 41:58.520
are observable data, and we have to accept

41:58.520 --> 41:59.840
some other checkpoints.

41:59.840 --> 42:00.320
Oh, good.

42:00.320 --> 42:03.920
Maybe we'd even have to accept divine revelation.

42:03.920 --> 42:04.720
Good.

42:04.720 --> 42:07.360
Yeah.

42:07.360 --> 42:09.040
So let's see where this leaves us.

42:12.080 --> 42:14.440
I do think it's an empirical doctrine,

42:14.440 --> 42:17.320
I mean a scientific doctrine coming out of science,

42:17.320 --> 42:19.680
in that science tells us there are only

42:19.680 --> 42:23.720
avenue of evidences through our senses

42:23.720 --> 42:29.200
by the impact of physical objects and forces.

42:32.120 --> 42:37.960
And furthermore, that we might get evidence to the contrary,

42:37.960 --> 42:41.600
and it would be still evidence of the kind that does count for me,

42:41.600 --> 42:44.160
because it would be observable evidence.

42:44.160 --> 42:50.160
And I can well imagine evidence for clairvoyance

42:50.160 --> 42:56.480
just in the prediction of observable events, where

42:56.480 --> 43:01.240
I couldn't see what empirical basis, in terms of known

43:01.240 --> 43:05.920
scientific forces, could have brought this about.

43:05.920 --> 43:11.480
And that would entail a revision not only of empiricism.

43:15.120 --> 43:16.680
Well, would it?

43:16.720 --> 43:21.600
Maybe we're getting a bifurcation here.

43:26.040 --> 43:26.760
What about that?

43:30.280 --> 43:33.800
It makes me wonder whether perhaps there's

43:33.800 --> 43:44.840
some difficulty in empiricism on the, yes,

43:44.840 --> 43:46.080
I think this is the trouble.

43:49.520 --> 43:55.920
Perhaps we should say that empiricism goes on,

43:55.920 --> 44:00.840
because I'm still settling only for corroboration

44:00.840 --> 44:03.840
in the observations.

44:03.840 --> 44:07.680
Yes, good, good.

44:07.680 --> 44:12.280
But what goes by the board is the doctrine

44:12.280 --> 44:17.640
that the input is just through the senses, at least

44:17.640 --> 44:20.920
through the senses that we've so thus far enumerated.

44:20.920 --> 44:23.680
And good.

44:27.840 --> 44:30.880
Well, I think the moral of this, this

44:30.880 --> 44:38.760
may be to have second thoughts about the statement

44:38.760 --> 44:43.440
that empiricism is a scientific result.

44:46.200 --> 44:47.720
Yes, that's good.

44:47.720 --> 44:48.440
That's interesting.

44:55.240 --> 44:58.120
Perhaps you've already answered this question

44:58.120 --> 44:59.320
and what you just said.

44:59.320 --> 45:04.160
But I wanted to ask you about which prominent philosophers

45:04.160 --> 45:10.120
in the 20th century you would say are clearly not

45:10.120 --> 45:11.560
sympathetic to naturalism.

45:11.560 --> 45:15.320
Don't endorse naturalism, as you see it.

45:18.400 --> 45:20.280
Well, I wonder.

45:20.280 --> 45:23.040
Certainly the ordinary language philosophers of England

45:23.040 --> 45:26.320
are naturalistic, as one could wish.

45:26.320 --> 45:29.720
It's the other extreme, whatever philosophers

45:29.760 --> 45:36.080
there are who are religious apologists,

45:36.080 --> 45:45.320
trying still to support notions of revelation

45:45.320 --> 45:47.000
would be an example to the contrary.

45:47.000 --> 45:51.440
Those are clear cases, both ends, I'd say.

45:51.440 --> 45:54.240
And then in between, what I would think of

45:54.240 --> 46:01.960
is just the philosophers who are still

46:01.960 --> 46:04.000
reluctant, even though not coming through

46:04.000 --> 46:08.840
with epistemological reductions of the kind that

46:08.840 --> 46:12.280
current up in the off-bau is undertaking.

46:12.280 --> 46:15.720
Something that's never been taken up so far as I know

46:15.720 --> 46:19.080
and pursued any further or could be.

46:19.120 --> 46:26.520
But still are dissatisfied with the naturalization

46:26.520 --> 46:29.400
of epistemology, in that they apparently still

46:29.400 --> 46:31.560
feel that there's a problem there.

46:31.560 --> 46:37.240
And this would be a negative kind still of non-naturalism.

46:37.240 --> 46:43.200
There's a question about where naturalism leaves one

46:43.200 --> 46:45.960
with respect to the issue of what is philosophy.

46:50.080 --> 46:53.760
One possibility that you have endorsed

46:53.760 --> 46:58.160
is that we think of philosophy as part of natural science.

47:01.040 --> 47:02.480
There are other possibilities.

47:02.480 --> 47:05.880
One might think that philosophy is simply

47:05.880 --> 47:09.400
discredited as a possible enterprise.

47:09.400 --> 47:14.280
Or one might think that philosophy, perhaps

47:14.280 --> 47:15.680
with Wittgenstein, the philosophy

47:15.680 --> 47:18.200
doesn't really aim at knowledge,

47:18.240 --> 47:21.600
but as a therapeutic endeavor.

47:21.600 --> 47:24.480
Is there any particular reason for picking

47:24.480 --> 47:26.800
your characterization of philosophy?

47:26.800 --> 47:32.040
No, that's not the characterization I intend.

47:32.040 --> 47:34.040
I may occasionally say things that

47:34.040 --> 47:38.160
sound very much like that, or even exactly like that.

47:38.160 --> 47:42.920
But what I mean is philosophy is continuous with science.

47:42.920 --> 47:45.560
My philosophy is continuous with science.

47:45.560 --> 47:47.560
I can say that because that follows

47:47.560 --> 47:49.120
from the fact that my philosophy, at least,

47:49.120 --> 47:51.760
is continuous with science and it's part of philosophy.

47:54.520 --> 47:56.960
And it may still be that, and I think it is,

47:56.960 --> 47:59.120
that my philosophy is more continuous with science

47:59.120 --> 48:02.720
than it is with some other parts of philosophy.

48:02.720 --> 48:07.000
And I don't think of this sort of thing,

48:07.000 --> 48:08.320
the scientific sort of philosophy,

48:08.320 --> 48:10.320
as being the whole of philosophy.

48:10.320 --> 48:12.840
There are other parts of philosophy, even, that I respect.

48:12.840 --> 48:14.080
Ethics.

48:14.640 --> 48:17.840
And of course, my position is that

48:17.840 --> 48:22.840
judgments of moral value, and likewise aesthetic value,

48:24.520 --> 48:29.520
are not part of science, except the anthropology

48:29.960 --> 48:30.880
behind them is.

48:37.640 --> 48:39.400
So I think a philosophy is quite a

48:39.680 --> 48:44.680
quite a scattered, quite an aggregate whole.

48:47.480 --> 48:51.040
And I should add, I think of furthermore,

48:51.040 --> 48:55.720
even rather sympathetically, of English ordinary

48:55.720 --> 48:59.040
language philosophy as being philosophy.

48:59.040 --> 49:01.160
It's just that it's not enough of it.

49:05.080 --> 49:09.040
I wanted to ask a question about Peter Strossen's paper,

49:09.080 --> 49:12.520
two conceptions of philosophy and the contrast

49:12.520 --> 49:15.480
between his naturalism and your naturalism.

49:17.080 --> 49:19.920
In that paper, Strossen says,

49:19.920 --> 49:21.680
what's this alternative conception?

49:21.680 --> 49:23.560
In other words, what's his conception of philosophy?

49:23.560 --> 49:26.200
Well, he says, the common as distinct

49:26.200 --> 49:29.440
from the scientific understanding is a complicated affair,

49:29.440 --> 49:33.800
embracing an indefinitely large range of ideas or concepts.

49:33.800 --> 49:38.120
He gives a long list of concepts and then says,

49:38.120 --> 49:40.080
the philosophical aim of those who adhere

49:40.080 --> 49:42.040
to my alternative conception of philosophy,

49:42.040 --> 49:45.360
I take to be that of elucidating the character

49:45.360 --> 49:49.200
of such concepts as these and their interconnections.

49:50.520 --> 49:52.760
What do you make of this alternative conception

49:52.760 --> 49:55.480
of philosophy and how does it differ from yours?

49:55.480 --> 49:57.560
It's narrower.

49:57.560 --> 50:00.880
Yes, I would count this as decidedly as philosophy.

50:00.880 --> 50:04.360
And in fact, it seems to me it's the,

50:05.280 --> 50:07.440
well, it's of a piece

50:07.440 --> 50:10.880
with the English Ordinary Language Philosophy.

50:10.880 --> 50:13.000
These concepts, you list,

50:13.000 --> 50:15.440
aren't very ordinary language, of course,

50:15.440 --> 50:19.000
but on the other hand, they're also not symbolic logic.

50:20.040 --> 50:21.560
And it's of a piece with that.

50:21.560 --> 50:23.280
And I think it's all philosophy.

50:23.280 --> 50:28.280
And it's even a lot, I think it's useful.

50:28.280 --> 50:33.280
I think it probably turns out to be very largely true even.

50:38.240 --> 50:39.560
But I wouldn't limit it to that

50:39.560 --> 50:42.280
because I think there are,

50:43.640 --> 50:47.080
well, a lot more that goes on that interests me

50:47.080 --> 50:49.640
in my part of philosophy that doesn't come under that head,

50:49.640 --> 50:51.720
not analysis of concepts.

50:53.400 --> 50:58.000
But, well, naturalized epistemology

50:58.040 --> 50:58.880
is one thing.

51:01.000 --> 51:06.000
And then all such ventures are fruitful or not as

51:16.000 --> 51:20.840
trying to get a more economical ontology

51:22.800 --> 51:27.800
such contortions as getting a better understanding

51:28.480 --> 51:32.120
of bodies identified with portions of space-time

51:32.120 --> 51:33.680
and then portions of space-time in turn

51:33.680 --> 51:38.680
with the classes of quadruples of numbers.

51:40.680 --> 51:42.560
That's, I think, inside the philosophy.

51:42.560 --> 51:47.560
And it's not analysis of concepts.

51:47.800 --> 51:50.240
Doesn't seem in quite the same sense, anyway.

51:50.240 --> 51:51.560
It's the kind of thing that would be regarded

51:51.560 --> 51:56.000
as further extension in an unaccustomed direction

51:56.000 --> 51:58.280
of natural science.

52:00.440 --> 52:02.240
One of the things that Strossen stresses

52:02.240 --> 52:04.880
is the interconnections between concepts.

52:04.880 --> 52:07.800
And sometimes he speaks of this in terms of

52:07.800 --> 52:10.280
plotting the contours of a conceptual scheme.

52:11.280 --> 52:14.440
Part of what this involves is not just listing

52:14.440 --> 52:16.120
a whole lot of things that we do,

52:16.120 --> 52:18.440
but trying to identify, in some sense,

52:18.440 --> 52:21.440
though not, I think, a scientific sense, particularly,

52:21.440 --> 52:22.840
what's basic about what we do.

52:22.840 --> 52:24.560
And so, for example, Strossen says

52:24.560 --> 52:27.040
that material bodies are basic particulars,

52:27.040 --> 52:28.800
not in the sense that they're basic for science,

52:28.800 --> 52:31.680
but in the sense that identification

52:31.680 --> 52:34.400
of material bodies, he says, is basic.

52:34.400 --> 52:36.800
Identification of other kinds of objects

52:36.800 --> 52:39.680
depends upon identification of material bodies

52:39.680 --> 52:40.840
and not conversely.

52:40.840 --> 52:42.240
So he argues.

52:42.240 --> 52:44.080
Do you think there's any good prospect

52:44.080 --> 52:47.240
for theoretical results of this kind in philosophy?

52:47.240 --> 52:50.080
Yes, this does sound good to me.

52:51.080 --> 52:56.080
And it's interesting, in particular,

52:57.440 --> 53:02.360
perhaps as an extension,

53:02.360 --> 53:05.360
and what seems to be an increasingly serious extension

53:05.360 --> 53:07.680
of ordinary language philosophy,

53:07.680 --> 53:10.480
where what is really coming into consideration

53:10.480 --> 53:14.040
is the structure of ordinary language,

53:14.040 --> 53:19.040
and not the structure in the linguist sense,

53:19.040 --> 53:24.040
but the conceptual structure of our whole ordinary

53:25.160 --> 53:27.360
and even extra ordinary, even scientific,

53:28.520 --> 53:29.720
conception of the world.

53:30.800 --> 53:35.800
And again, very much a part of what I regard

53:38.880 --> 53:41.040
as philosophy and useful,

53:41.040 --> 53:45.720
and as conspicuously continuous with science.

53:46.680 --> 53:47.960
Paul asked earlier about

53:47.960 --> 53:50.600
whether naturalism could be justified,

53:50.600 --> 53:53.400
perhaps within the naturalist camp.

53:53.400 --> 53:54.920
There are these different projects.

53:54.920 --> 53:56.920
I wonder how one or other of those

53:56.920 --> 53:58.760
might be chosen ahead of the other.

53:58.760 --> 54:01.480
Strossen himself says of the two conceptions,

54:01.480 --> 54:04.440
each has its own worth, he says, and its own appeal.

54:04.440 --> 54:05.960
The choice between them is ultimately,

54:05.960 --> 54:08.920
perhaps, a matter of individual temperament.

54:08.920 --> 54:10.120
Do you think that's right?

54:10.120 --> 54:15.120
The choice of them for what?

54:19.400 --> 54:21.760
One can very well choose music instead of,

54:23.760 --> 54:28.760
without casting aspersions on philosophy,

54:30.560 --> 54:32.560
you can choose music instead,

54:32.560 --> 54:36.340
and one can do fiction instead of science.

54:37.340 --> 54:42.340
I think of the insistence on observation

54:44.500 --> 54:48.700
as the checkpoint, insofar as any checkpoint can be,

54:52.900 --> 54:57.900
can exist for what deserves the name of science.

55:00.900 --> 55:03.060
And although a great deal of what deserves

55:03.100 --> 55:06.980
the name of science can't be checked,

55:08.300 --> 55:09.980
directly or indirectly, I claim,

55:10.940 --> 55:14.060
still, when it is checked, it's going to be checked that way.

55:16.020 --> 55:20.060
And I think of this not as something to establish,

55:21.300 --> 55:25.820
but what distinguishes that scientific endeavor.

55:25.820 --> 55:27.780
Now, how would anybody want to do that?

55:28.660 --> 55:33.660
There, of course, there are two frequent reasons.

55:35.020 --> 55:40.020
One is technology, and the other is

55:41.260 --> 55:43.620
just intellectual curiosity.

55:45.060 --> 55:46.460
I suppose the question, partly,

55:46.460 --> 55:50.260
is how large a role science is going to play

55:50.260 --> 55:52.380
in one's intellectual life.

55:54.220 --> 55:56.300
Strawson, in effect, takes up the question

55:56.340 --> 56:00.260
that you've just asked, the question, for what?

56:00.260 --> 56:02.860
And he says, for one content to lead his life,

56:02.860 --> 56:04.580
at least his intellectual life,

56:04.580 --> 56:06.620
in the rarefied atmosphere of science,

56:06.620 --> 56:09.500
the choice on this test will go one way.

56:09.500 --> 56:12.660
For one content to lead his intellectual life

56:12.660 --> 56:16.140
in the muddier atmosphere of the more mundane,

56:16.140 --> 56:17.380
it will go the other way.

56:18.900 --> 56:20.700
Does that seem to you to be the key,

56:20.700 --> 56:22.740
whether one has a taste for the rarefied

56:22.740 --> 56:24.940
or a taste for the muddier?

56:24.940 --> 56:27.140
Well, I'm wondering just what the other way is,

56:27.140 --> 56:28.700
in this case, what he has in mind.

56:28.700 --> 56:31.260
He just had in mind what he calls

56:31.260 --> 56:35.660
the more liberal or Catholic conception of philosophy.

56:35.660 --> 56:38.820
Well, I think maybe he's a shift

56:38.820 --> 56:41.260
to a more liberal or Catholic conception of science,

56:41.260 --> 56:44.420
and he wouldn't find the discrepancy.

56:45.340 --> 56:48.900
Made it sound as if naturalism consisted

56:48.900 --> 56:53.780
in your being prepared to call science

56:53.780 --> 56:57.460
the only things that were subject

56:57.460 --> 57:00.020
to the checkpoint of observation.

57:00.020 --> 57:04.260
And that makes the doctrine sound somewhat terminological.

57:04.260 --> 57:07.180
So it makes the doctrine sound as if it's just about

57:07.180 --> 57:08.820
what you are going to call science,

57:08.820 --> 57:10.420
and what you are not going to call science,

57:10.420 --> 57:13.580
and who cares about terminology.

57:15.060 --> 57:18.060
No, I don't think that is a naturalistic position.

57:18.380 --> 57:19.220
I see.

57:22.780 --> 57:27.780
I just think of that as the distinguishing trait

57:30.740 --> 57:34.460
of anything that any of us would think of as science

57:34.460 --> 57:37.100
in the broadest sense, including history,

57:38.660 --> 57:43.260
that if there is a checkpoint, it's there.

57:43.260 --> 57:47.820
And on the other hand, I wouldn't expect one

57:47.860 --> 57:52.060
to call something science if the checkpoints

57:52.060 --> 57:57.060
were supernatural, the alleged checkpoints.

58:00.340 --> 58:05.340
Do you think, is this closer to what your naturalism

58:05.900 --> 58:10.900
consists in, that one simply ought to believe things

58:12.340 --> 58:17.340
that haven't been subject to these things

58:18.820 --> 58:23.820
that aren't subject to those observational checkpoints?

58:25.900 --> 58:30.900
No, no, on the contrary, I hold that a great deal

58:33.100 --> 58:38.100
of what's in science, the broad sense of this broad sense

58:39.740 --> 58:42.140
has no checkpoint, direct or indirect,

58:42.140 --> 58:47.140
and is still valuable, and valuable for science itself

58:47.220 --> 58:49.660
and indirectly for prediction, but very indirectly,

58:49.660 --> 58:53.500
namely as suggesting for further filling out

58:54.380 --> 58:57.620
some more hypotheses, which, unlike those first ones,

58:57.620 --> 59:00.580
do link up indirectly, systematically,

59:00.580 --> 59:05.580
with critical masses that can as whole apply observations.

59:08.380 --> 59:13.140
And I think that science would be very severely impoverished

59:13.820 --> 59:18.820
if the evenly, most liberal sort of positivism

59:23.100 --> 59:24.180
were put into effect.

59:25.220 --> 59:27.620
But all these things fit into the web of belief

59:27.620 --> 59:30.540
in one way or another, all the things that you think

59:30.540 --> 59:32.300
should be, could be believed.

59:33.580 --> 59:35.580
So I don't insist on checkpoints.

59:35.580 --> 59:38.860
All I am assisting on here is negative,

59:38.860 --> 59:43.300
namely, no checkpoints except observation.

59:46.740 --> 59:48.460
Where do that leave ethics?

59:50.080 --> 59:55.080
Out of science, but in philosophy,

59:56.660 --> 59:59.020
and in respectable philosophy.

59:59.020 --> 01:00:02.300
And in what we might legitimately believe,

01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:03.540
doctrines.

01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:06.540
Well, in another sense of believe, yes.

01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:11.340
It has been noted by many philosophers yourself included

01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:13.780
that there are points of contact between your thinking

01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:16.420
and that of American pragmatism.

01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:19.540
explicitly mentioned, for example, in the Dewey lecture,

01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:21.860
some agreements you have with Dewey.

01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:25.660
To what extent was pragmatism an actual influence on you?

01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:32.260
I think, well, it's hard to think of any.

01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:33.340
It's hard to think of any.

01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:35.740
And I haven't been clear of my own mind

01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:38.300
on what constitutes pragmatism

01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:43.300
and what separates it from epistemology, from empiricism.

01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:48.980
I've thought about various tenets

01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:52.500
held by various card-carrying pragmatists,

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:57.500
James, Dewey, Perce.

01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:05.340
And they seem to be far enough from each other.

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:11.340
At least as far from one another

01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:16.340
as any of them from some non-pragmatists,

01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:21.340
as far as they're usually classified.

01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:28.820
So I've never considered myself a pragmatist.

01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:32.780
And that's where that misleading paragraph

01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:36.340
at the end of Two Dogs was makes all the difference.

01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:38.780
Where I'm picking up Carnop's phrase

01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:41.620
that he applied to his frameworks

01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:43.340
as being purely pragmatic,

01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:48.340
unlike the rest of science, which is empirical.

01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:53.540
And where I say, well, yes, I agree with Carnop

01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:58.540
about the character of what he's calling the framework.

01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:00.940
Of what he's calling the framework,

01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:04.380
but of course I'm questioning the difference

01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:06.460
between the framework and the rest of science.

01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:08.980
And I'm saying that it's just that my pragmatism

01:02:08.980 --> 01:02:12.340
is more through or going, I would apply it across the board.

01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:17.260
But that's, as it turned out, was an unfortunate way

01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:21.420
of putting it, I was just using his word.

01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:24.900
I have a post of pragmatism, it's just that I've wondered

01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:27.060
just what is distinctive about it.

01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:31.300
And so I've never considered myself a pragmatist.

01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:35.620
You mentioned Carnop's notion of framework.

01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:37.500
One difference between you and Carnop

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:41.100
that come over and over again in various guises in the years

01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:43.260
is your attitude toward natural language

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:45.100
as opposed to constructed language.

01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:47.860
Carnop almost never wants to deal with natural language.

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:52.260
He always wants to define his notions

01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:54.460
only for constructed languages,

01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:57.140
where you always seem to want to pull him back

01:02:57.140 --> 01:03:00.420
into consideration of what languages people actually speak.

01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:03.620
Yes, yes, because I think of those constructions

01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:08.620
as superstructures for one or another particular,

01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:11.780
generally local, temporary purpose.

01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:18.540
And I think of axiom or postulate as a,

01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:23.820
in effect an indexical indicator word,

01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:28.420
namely something relative to the particular project

01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:31.580
of pedagogy that one's engaged in.

01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:34.020
Here's the way he's organizing this law

01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:37.780
that he wants the reader to master.

01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:39.900
He's putting it in this order

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:42.020
and deducing these from those.

01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:43.780
Somebody might find an even more efficient way

01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:45.820
of doing it the other end too,

01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:49.240
and that there's nothing intrinsic about those things.

01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:52.140
The artificial language,

01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:57.100
of course, if one thinks primarily

01:03:57.100 --> 01:03:58.340
in terms of artificial languages,

01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:01.540
then there's no problem about analyticity,

01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:05.240
that what's analytic is the axioms and their consequences.

01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:10.340
So what is the point of artificial language?

01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:13.460
Well, it depends, of course, on what it's used for,

01:04:13.460 --> 01:04:18.460
but at one point I presented this artificial example,

01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:30.380
a positivist, a logical positivist named Ixman.

01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:35.340
I thought of that now.

01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:41.340
Ixman is making some point about the meaning

01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:43.860
of some metaphysics in which he,

01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:51.540
some metaphysical, these things are meaningless,

01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:56.140
and his argument is that you could have all of science

01:04:57.140 --> 01:04:59.180
and all of our predictions and everything

01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:02.140
without any of these metaphysical questions even coming in.

01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:06.300
And to show this, at least with some examples,

01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:09.980
he says, imagine a tribe,

01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:16.980
a tribe of Martians who speak a language

01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:18.380
of the following sort,

01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:21.980
and then he sets up an artificial language.

01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:26.980
He has to tell us a good deal about the syntax

01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:30.420
and vocabulary, but just certain parts,

01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:32.260
just the parts that are gonna make his point

01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:34.380
at the point of this particular metaphysical sentence

01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:38.660
that he's taking the props out from under.

01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:44.860
So he lays down these particular traits of the language,

01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:45.780
whenever these things,

01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:47.580
there are these sentences when these are true,

01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:52.580
these are true, and that's all he needs to make his point.

01:05:54.140 --> 01:05:56.100
All right, there's an artificial language,

01:05:56.100 --> 01:05:57.900
and there's a perfectly clear sense

01:05:57.900 --> 01:05:59.740
in which we can say what's analytic and what isn't,

01:05:59.740 --> 01:06:01.100
what's in the framework,

01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:03.900
and what is empirical outside the framework,

01:06:03.900 --> 01:06:06.020
namely what Ixman has laid down.

01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:10.380
But what was the significance of his laying it down?

01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:11.220
Well, in this example,

01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:12.980
we know exactly what the significance was,

01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:14.940
and it doesn't throw any light

01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:17.860
on a more general notion of analytic.

01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:20.140
And it's this sort of consideration

01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:23.780
that has made me

01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:31.900
empirical in my approach

01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:36.900
or my criticism of these semantical notions.

01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:44.660
Besides your naturalism or empiricism,

01:06:44.660 --> 01:06:46.460
perhaps they're the same thing,

01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:50.740
you've singled out as central doctrines of your philosophy,

01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:55.180
what you call your extensionalism,

01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:58.700
and also your skepticism about meaning.

01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:01.060
Could you tell us something about what these doctrines are

01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:03.300
and how they relate to one another?

01:07:03.300 --> 01:07:08.300
Well, essentialism is what's involved in saying that

01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:15.580
classes that have the same members,

01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:19.900
everything that's true of a class

01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:24.900
is true of a class that has the same members as that class.

01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:27.460
In that sense, therefore,

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:29.140
they are just one class, not two.

01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:35.940
And that's extensionalism,

01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:40.660
the core of it, that's the law of extensionality.

01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:46.540
In an extensional language,

01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:52.900
any two predicates are interchangeable

01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:56.260
without, if they are true of the same objects,

01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:58.380
interchangeable without disturbing the truth value

01:07:58.380 --> 01:08:00.180
of the sentence in which they occur.

01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:06.180
So that for an extensional language,

01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:10.220
therefore, there's no difference

01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:12.260
between a property and a class.

01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:17.260
Properties are identical for such a theory,

01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:20.580
such a language, if and only if they have the same,

01:08:20.580 --> 01:08:23.180
if and only if they're true of the same things.

01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:26.220
Therefore, you might as well call them classes, and I do.

01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:28.980
And thus, I don't recognize properties.

01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:36.180
Well, that's really the whole of essentialism.

01:08:39.860 --> 01:08:44.420
But when, good Lord, I mean of extensionalism,

01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:50.620
but an important consequence of it is

01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:55.620
that there's no difficulty in an extensionalist language

01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:58.220
or an extensional language,

01:08:59.140 --> 01:09:03.780
we can say, no problem about the

01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:06.300
substitutivity of identity.

01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:11.300
That is to say that if two terms are names of the same thing,

01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:16.700
two singular terms are names of the same thing

01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:21.460
and nothing else, you can put one for the other

01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:22.580
in any context anywhere,

01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:26.060
and again, the truth will be undisturbed.

01:09:28.780 --> 01:09:33.780
It's hard to make sense really of that law failing

01:09:34.820 --> 01:09:37.180
if the things really are identical.

01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:42.180
But when you get away from extensional context,

01:09:42.860 --> 01:09:46.980
that does seem continuously to be threatened.

01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:51.780
And that's one of the practical virtues

01:09:52.940 --> 01:09:57.740
of trying to maintain a completely extensional theory.

01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:04.220
Could you explain how this extensionalist position,

01:10:06.740 --> 01:10:11.220
denial are any properties over and above classes?

01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:14.380
How that relates to your skepticism about meaning?

01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:17.980
It relates in this way.

01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:21.780
It's not enough to warrant the skepticism,

01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:23.700
not in itself altogether,

01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:25.060
but it does relate in this way

01:10:25.060 --> 01:10:27.980
that pretty good that are two of the same things,

01:10:27.980 --> 01:10:30.220
still may or may not have the same meaning.

01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:38.300
So it's a, so sameness of meaning

01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:40.900
is a distinction that goes beyond

01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:46.500
sameness of extension,

01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:49.180
sameness of objects denoted.

01:10:50.020 --> 01:10:54.300
I wanted to ask about properties in the fully

01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:58.460
austere ontology where we just have classes

01:10:58.460 --> 01:11:01.180
of four tuples of real numbers.

01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:04.580
Well, there properties as traditionally conceived

01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:08.060
aren't recognized, but then nor are I suppose

01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:11.860
tables and mountains fuzzy blurred objects

01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:14.380
as normally conceived recognized.

01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:16.980
But still I sense that you're more sympathetic

01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:20.460
to tables and mountains than you are to properties.

01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:21.380
One of you would say why?

01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:27.220
Yes, one has to settle for their fuzziness

01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:33.700
since all empirically learned terms are vague

01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:35.700
that way on their edges at least.

01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:39.620
And we can't do without them.

01:11:39.620 --> 01:11:42.940
And the way I'm inclined to accommodate them,

01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:47.940
however, is by taking as my theoretical ontology

01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:53.460
objects that are not fuzzy.

01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:58.460
And it would mean that any of indefinitely many

01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:06.580
distinct from one another,

01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:11.580
mutually distinct bodies, real bodies could be

01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:21.820
identified with that table.

01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:27.580
It would make no difference in all applications

01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:29.100
of our scientific theory.

01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:31.460
But from the theoretical point of view,

01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:33.420
we would consider ourselves to be talking about

01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:36.260
one of that multitude and not all of them.

01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:40.740
Well, as for properties, I can understand

01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:44.100
the antipathy to properties particularly

01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:47.700
if properties are seen as related to extensions

01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:52.220
as sense to reference using Frager's terminology

01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:55.260
because properties would come under the scope

01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:57.660
of skepticism about meaning in that case.

01:12:57.660 --> 01:12:59.580
What about the alternative conception of properties

01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:01.060
where properties are thought of as lying

01:13:01.060 --> 01:13:05.220
in between a fragrance sense and extension?

01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:10.860
How do you feel about admitting those to your ontology?

01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:12.020
No, I'm against it.

01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:15.180
My objection is again,

01:13:15.220 --> 01:13:19.660
I'm just over the principle of individuation,

01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:24.660
of what I would want would be an explanation of clear one,

01:13:27.260 --> 01:13:32.260
of just when to say of property A and property B

01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:35.380
in that sense that they're the same property.

01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:39.060
And you're skeptical about that.

01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:40.300
I don't know any way to do it.

01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:45.620
I'm supposing the scientists were more certain

01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:49.500
that they needed properties than they were of any account

01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:51.220
they could offer you just now

01:13:51.220 --> 01:13:53.980
of the individuation conditions for properties.

01:13:53.980 --> 01:13:56.020
And so they just set that as a research project.

01:13:56.020 --> 01:13:57.900
Would that be an okay way to proceed?

01:13:59.140 --> 01:14:02.500
Yes, it would, it would.

01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:05.780
And it seems to be the way people do proceed.

01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:11.100
Well, it would, yes, in order to proceed that way,

01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:13.380
of course, they would have to be thinking

01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:17.860
in terms of the particular, to me very mysterious,

01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:21.180
situations where they felt they couldn't do without them.

01:14:21.180 --> 01:14:23.820
And then that's what they'd be doing

01:14:23.820 --> 01:14:26.220
in their continuing investigation.

01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:30.300
That would be to try to sharpen,

01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:35.300
define some concept that would serve

01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:38.660
that purpose and that could be appropriately

01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:40.060
then be called properties.

01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:44.460
The situation could be worse still.

01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:51.140
The familiar situation in, of course,

01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:54.020
in theoretical physics, notably,

01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:57.980
is to introduce a new term for a technical purpose

01:14:57.980 --> 01:15:01.780
without giving any definition at all, any clear definition.

01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:06.220
The names for the elementary particles

01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:08.220
without exception are in that status.

01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:09.740
They're not defined.

01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:13.580
We're told a lot of things about them enough

01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:15.340
so that one can get on.

01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:20.340
And conceivably, if there was something

01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:23.420
that might appropriately be called properties

01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:25.700
that seem to be needed in science,

01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:27.660
they might even be brought in that way.

01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:29.300
And we would learn to put up with them

01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:31.420
by mastering all the things

01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:34.260
that can usefully be said about them,

01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:37.180
even though everyone was at a loss to define them.

01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:41.220
That I'd, I'd face it, that would be, of course,

01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:45.020
what one always wishes for something clearer

01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:46.460
and more elegant, but you,

01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:51.460
but nature gets in there sometimes and prevents it.

01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:53.100
I wonder whether there'd be another point

01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:55.180
at which properties might need to come in.

01:15:55.180 --> 01:16:00.180
Those who see events as the terms in causal relations

01:16:00.340 --> 01:16:03.020
are often driven to say something a little bit more,

01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:05.780
which is that some of the properties of an event

01:16:05.780 --> 01:16:08.380
are causally efficacious, as it's said,

01:16:08.380 --> 01:16:10.100
other properties of the event not.

01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:11.700
And just to be able to say that,

01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:13.620
on the face of it seems to be a matter

01:16:13.620 --> 01:16:15.220
of quantifying over properties.

01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:17.980
Yes, well, the way I handle that one

01:16:17.980 --> 01:16:22.620
is that I take the events as extensional.

01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:27.660
And in fact, I do, in general,

01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:33.140
think of a physical object as the,

01:16:33.140 --> 01:16:37.780
in the most general sense, as the content

01:16:37.780 --> 01:16:40.340
of some portion of space-time.

01:16:40.340 --> 01:16:42.060
It needn't be a continuous portion at all.

01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:43.740
It could be scattered.

01:16:43.740 --> 01:16:46.980
It could be sugar, for instance,

01:16:46.980 --> 01:16:50.900
of, as an object for me,

01:16:50.900 --> 01:16:53.700
is a single physical object.

01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:57.580
It's all the sugar in the world, past, present, future.

01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:01.740
Or, of course, one could equally just identify it

01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:04.820
with the portion of space-time that it takes up.

01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:08.140
That's purely a verbal difference at this point,

01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:08.980
it seems to me.

01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:14.860
And I think of events as physical objects,

01:17:14.860 --> 01:17:17.940
in that sense, and as extensional.

01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:21.500
And then the question arises that the question is you raised.

01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:24.740
Here you have an event of,

01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:33.740
well, let's see, I remember Davidson had an example

01:17:33.740 --> 01:17:36.700
that brought this out.

01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:40.540
If I could, here's some sort of a contrivance

01:17:40.540 --> 01:17:41.380
that's

01:17:42.380 --> 01:17:43.380
of

01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:50.540
rotating, that's right, a heating up.

01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:58.540
And the heating up causes a bit of ice to melt

01:17:58.540 --> 01:18:04.780
and the immediate environment, as we say,

01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:06.300
the heating up caused that.

01:18:06.300 --> 01:18:08.900
There's the property in a broad sense.

01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:17.500
But the heating up, in this case, and the rotating,

01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:21.140
are inseparable.

01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:32.260
And so what I would say is, yes, so far as this,

01:18:32.260 --> 01:18:38.300
that although it's strange, strange usage,

01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:41.900
and after all, I'm not doing philosophy of ordinary language,

01:18:41.900 --> 01:18:47.300
but rather I prefer to be doing these things

01:18:47.300 --> 01:18:50.500
in the spirit of mathematicians who will bring in new symbols

01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:55.900
and new terms just in order to clarify what they're doing

01:18:55.900 --> 01:18:58.700
or make it simpler and easier to follow.

01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:05.700
And as far as I can see, it would fit all the purposes

01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:10.780
of science to make the following unidiomatic departure

01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:17.300
and say that, yes, that time, the spinning melted the ice.

01:19:19.620 --> 01:19:25.220
The spinning of the event, the spinning of that wheel

01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:29.620
melted the ice because the heating of the wheel

01:19:29.620 --> 01:19:35.060
and the spinning of the wheel were both what the wheel was

01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:37.700
doing, was the state of the wheel.

01:19:37.700 --> 01:19:43.620
No harm because the fact remains that our general law,

01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:51.460
that nearby heating melts ice, stands,

01:19:51.460 --> 01:19:56.780
and there's no suggestion of a law that some nearby spinning

01:19:56.780 --> 01:19:59.340
melts ice.

01:19:59.340 --> 01:20:02.220
I suppose you'd be unlucky if all the spinnings were

01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:04.500
heating and all the heatings were spinning.

01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:11.100
Yes, well, that would pose a problem which scientists

01:20:11.100 --> 01:20:16.860
would be eager to get into, just why is that, but quite.

01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:19.220
So you're not inclined to go down the path of saying

01:20:19.220 --> 01:20:23.380
that the heating which is a spinning, on this occasion,

01:20:23.380 --> 01:20:27.700
causes the ice to melt, causes quay heating the ice to melt,

01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:30.300
although it doesn't cause quay spinning the ice to melt.

01:20:30.300 --> 01:20:32.060
That's the point we should appeal to some, I think.

01:20:32.060 --> 01:20:35.780
Yes, well, that was all to some, I can imagine.

01:20:35.780 --> 01:20:43.180
Oh, yes, so that would be a good day-to-day vernacular way

01:20:43.180 --> 01:20:45.980
of doing it, despite of the non-vernacular status of quay.

01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:56.380
But I wouldn't, because that brings in concepts

01:20:56.380 --> 01:20:59.500
that I don't think we need and that I find

01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:00.780
it clear to avoid.

01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:07.340
I'm going to quit while I'm at it, I think.

01:21:07.340 --> 01:21:11.660
About ontology, you share with Carnap

01:21:11.660 --> 01:21:15.300
certain basic predilection for wanting

01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:17.420
to rob certain questions of their force.

01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:22.140
For example, the question, what is an ordered pair really?

01:21:22.140 --> 01:21:25.620
Now, Carnap, one of, I think, his main motivation

01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:28.860
is to make sure that those sorts of questions don't make sense.

01:21:28.900 --> 01:21:31.260
And he has this elaborate notion of framework

01:21:31.260 --> 01:21:33.460
and what's in a framework, what's outside a framework that

01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:35.420
does that work for him.

01:21:35.420 --> 01:21:37.420
So how do you rob that kind of question?

01:21:37.420 --> 01:21:40.020
Well, I think I'd agree with Carnap, not framework.

01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:43.420
No, but that's right, but I would agree with his conclusion.

01:21:48.100 --> 01:21:54.180
I think the trouble with this is that we're using a term that

01:21:54.180 --> 01:21:58.060
hasn't been sufficiently, it hasn't been either defined

01:21:58.060 --> 01:22:02.140
or sufficiently described, to cover the particular circumstance

01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:06.540
that we're questioning, so that in that sense,

01:22:06.540 --> 01:22:10.220
it's a meaningless question.

01:22:10.220 --> 01:22:13.820
But as you've said, there is no entity without identity,

01:22:13.820 --> 01:22:17.180
so you have to do something.

01:22:17.180 --> 01:22:20.060
Yes, but which entity is it?

01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:28.740
Of course, that begs the question again,

01:22:28.740 --> 01:22:33.100
but I don't see how there's any dodging that one.

01:22:33.100 --> 01:22:38.500
The ordered pair can be defined serviceably

01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:41.580
in any number of ways.

01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:47.020
And there are several ways that have come into the literature,

01:22:47.020 --> 01:22:49.380
and it doesn't matter which ones you use,

01:22:49.420 --> 01:22:55.180
just so you can prove the basic law of the ordered pair.

01:22:55.180 --> 01:22:59.660
That x, y is identical with z, w if and only if x

01:22:59.660 --> 01:23:03.100
is identical with z and y with w.

01:23:03.100 --> 01:23:09.740
And so for practical purposes, the meaning of ordered pair

01:23:09.740 --> 01:23:12.060
is just that.

01:23:12.060 --> 01:23:18.420
And then in order for the sake of it,

01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:22.140
and commonly, we can leave it at that in practice and do.

01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:24.220
And there's a corresponding situation,

01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:27.140
well-known in the case of saying what numbers are,

01:23:27.140 --> 01:23:32.540
what the positive integers are, of different ways of doing it,

01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:35.540
all of which are perfectly good, and it doesn't matter which.

01:23:41.340 --> 01:23:45.540
And then there are two ways of looking at that situation,

01:23:45.540 --> 01:23:49.380
in both the case of the pair and the numbers.

01:23:49.380 --> 01:23:52.500
Namely, one way is, yes, here we've

01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:55.700
got this ambiguous term ordered pair,

01:23:55.700 --> 01:23:58.780
or the many kinds of ordered pair.

01:23:58.780 --> 01:24:02.020
But I think that philosophically, the more straightforward way

01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:06.180
is, in this case, elimination.

01:24:06.180 --> 01:24:10.700
And say, now we've shown, here we've defined ordered pair.

01:24:10.700 --> 01:24:11.940
We're shown we're not going to need

01:24:11.940 --> 01:24:14.140
to assume, as an irreducible notion,

01:24:14.140 --> 01:24:16.380
the notion of ordered pair, because we've

01:24:16.380 --> 01:24:20.660
got other notions here, which, if we put them together

01:24:20.660 --> 01:24:23.180
in the right combination, we'll do the same trick.

01:24:23.180 --> 01:24:24.140
So let's do that.

01:24:24.140 --> 01:24:25.620
And there are no such things as pairs.

01:24:25.620 --> 01:24:26.780
Do the same thing about numbers.

01:24:26.780 --> 01:24:30.780
There are no such things as the positive integers.

01:24:30.780 --> 01:24:32.740
We're just talking about these sets.

01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:37.860
But then it's awkward to keep, we need a name, a short name,

01:24:37.860 --> 01:24:44.100
for these little constructions that we are serving as stand-ins.

01:24:44.820 --> 01:24:46.540
For the pair.

01:24:46.540 --> 01:24:50.740
And so what better name, since we've already

01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:52.300
freed the term ordered pair.

01:24:52.300 --> 01:24:53.660
It doesn't refer to anything anymore.

01:24:53.660 --> 01:24:54.980
Those are gone.

01:24:54.980 --> 01:24:55.980
Let's reuse it.

01:24:55.980 --> 01:24:57.340
It's another kind of economy.

01:25:00.860 --> 01:25:05.020
So that's the way I suggest looking at these situations.

01:25:10.020 --> 01:25:12.020
Is there, do you see any relationship

01:25:12.020 --> 01:25:14.060
between the particular situation one

01:25:14.060 --> 01:25:17.340
is in here, and thinking about what numbers are

01:25:17.340 --> 01:25:20.860
or what an ordered pair is, and your general doctrine

01:25:20.860 --> 01:25:24.100
of ontological relativity?

01:25:24.100 --> 01:25:28.060
That's, yeah, interesting thought.

01:25:28.060 --> 01:25:28.560
I hadn't.

01:25:34.220 --> 01:25:35.780
Well, yes, yes.

01:25:35.780 --> 01:25:40.020
Yes, there certainly is in very broad terms.

01:25:40.020 --> 01:25:42.780
The point about ontological relativity

01:25:42.780 --> 01:25:51.780
was that there are certain functions,

01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:57.140
tagging functions, you might say, which

01:25:57.140 --> 01:26:01.860
are various so-called objects we're performing.

01:26:01.860 --> 01:26:05.620
But serving, really, as far as the logical structure

01:26:05.620 --> 01:26:09.980
or even the empirical support and checkpoints

01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:16.860
of our theory is concerned, mirror nodes

01:26:16.860 --> 01:26:18.100
in the logical structure.

01:26:26.380 --> 01:26:31.060
We can reshuffle these objects, put in any others that

01:26:31.060 --> 01:26:32.660
are in one one correlation with them.

01:26:32.660 --> 01:26:34.380
They deserve that purpose just as well.

01:26:36.620 --> 01:26:46.580
And so if we had some systematic way of naming these nodes,

01:26:46.580 --> 01:26:49.580
neutral names, we could just put those in

01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:52.460
and just get rid of all these other names for objects.

01:26:52.460 --> 01:26:57.900
However, we have no systematic way of naming those nodes.

01:26:57.900 --> 01:27:01.460
The only thing we do is name them in our unsystematic way.

01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:04.780
And so we have these various terms for these various objects.

01:27:04.780 --> 01:27:08.300
And we talk about rabbits and this and that.

01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:11.900
But in talking about rabbits, cats, et cetera,

01:27:11.900 --> 01:27:22.540
we might just as well be talking about cat compliments

01:27:22.540 --> 01:27:24.620
and rabbit compliments and the like.

01:27:24.620 --> 01:27:27.900
So there's good parallel.

01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:31.660
Would the following, though, be something of a difference?

01:27:31.700 --> 01:27:35.940
In my own language, of course, using my own language,

01:27:35.940 --> 01:27:37.900
I can't use any other one.

01:27:37.900 --> 01:27:40.580
And I can think to myself, well, I

01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:46.580
wonder whether the number one is such and such a set

01:27:46.580 --> 01:27:50.540
or whether it is such and such a different set.

01:27:50.540 --> 01:27:54.340
Which of these identity statements should I believe?

01:27:54.340 --> 01:27:57.420
And it seems to me to be a genuine question.

01:27:58.420 --> 01:28:05.620
But if I contrast that with the question,

01:28:05.620 --> 01:28:13.140
I wonder whether my word or my linguistic expression,

01:28:13.140 --> 01:28:20.140
the number one, really does refer to the number one.

01:28:20.140 --> 01:28:23.500
That doesn't seem in the same way as if it could be

01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:27.020
a genuine question for me.

01:28:27.020 --> 01:28:35.940
It seems a trivial matter of what the word refers to means

01:28:35.940 --> 01:28:42.740
that my expression, the number one, does, for me,

01:28:42.740 --> 01:28:44.660
pick out the number one.

01:28:44.660 --> 01:28:47.420
Well, but then that raises the question

01:28:47.420 --> 01:28:51.060
in that refers to the number one and what sense of number one.

01:28:57.060 --> 01:28:59.740
In the case of abstract objects like the number one,

01:28:59.740 --> 01:29:04.780
that seems to me that ontological relativity doesn't even

01:29:04.780 --> 01:29:08.020
it doesn't even need to seem counterintuitive.

01:29:08.020 --> 01:29:16.300
Frege, I seem to remember, raised the question or mentioned

01:29:16.300 --> 01:29:20.820
the question, or the possibility, what is the number one?

01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:22.740
It could be Julius Caesar.

01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:24.380
Doesn't matter.

01:29:25.380 --> 01:29:30.100
He went at least that far into ontological relativity.

01:29:30.100 --> 01:29:33.980
And oh, and then Ramsey with his,

01:29:33.980 --> 01:29:38.300
what have come since his day to be called Ramsey sentences,

01:29:38.300 --> 01:29:40.500
rather brings out that point, again, for abstract objects.

01:29:46.140 --> 01:29:49.180
It seems fairly intuitive that even

01:29:49.180 --> 01:29:53.380
that abstract objects are brought in there just

01:29:53.380 --> 01:29:59.540
as stopping points or to bring things together.

01:30:03.620 --> 01:30:05.180
It wouldn't matter.

01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:06.420
Well, of course, we know it.

01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:09.100
It doesn't matter how we go on and artificially

01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:15.500
define these numbers as long as we get the behavior out of them,

01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:23.740
the properties that make them useful in application.

01:30:23.740 --> 01:30:26.060
And formerly, those properties are just

01:30:26.060 --> 01:30:30.420
the properties of a regression, a sequence

01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:32.060
of the kind called a progression.

01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:45.460
But there's an example that we use of two physicists

01:30:45.460 --> 01:30:51.580
who at a time out, did I have to do this before?

01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:54.980
I know I mentioned it, but I'm not sure I did it,

01:30:54.980 --> 01:30:56.980
about the neutrino and the physicists.

01:30:56.980 --> 01:30:57.780
I know you didn't.

01:30:57.780 --> 01:30:58.980
Good.

01:30:58.980 --> 01:31:04.740
Well, yes, this, I think, brings out some of the spirit of it.

01:31:04.740 --> 01:31:09.620
There's a crisis in physics, and something

01:31:09.620 --> 01:31:12.820
has to be done in revising the theory or supplementing it.

01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:17.140
And one physicist suggested maybe we

01:31:17.140 --> 01:31:18.220
needed a new particle.

01:31:18.220 --> 01:31:22.180
In fact, two physicists arrived at that idea

01:31:22.180 --> 01:31:25.620
of introducing a new particle with certain properties

01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:31.820
that will help clear up the paradox.

01:31:31.820 --> 01:31:39.020
And one of them brings in a particle that has some rest mass,

01:31:39.020 --> 01:31:42.300
and the other one brings in a particle that has no rest mass.

01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:46.180
But they both apply the same word, neutrino.

01:31:46.180 --> 01:31:48.620
And it seems to me it presents no problem

01:31:48.620 --> 01:31:52.820
to say that there's clearly no meaning to the question

01:31:52.820 --> 01:31:56.660
whether, A, they are talking about the same particle,

01:31:56.660 --> 01:32:01.860
but disagree in its properties, or B,

01:32:01.860 --> 01:32:03.500
they're talking about different particles.

01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:05.540
One has a rest mass, the other hasn't,

01:32:05.540 --> 01:32:08.700
but they happen to have given it the same name.

01:32:08.700 --> 01:32:10.060
No difference.

01:32:10.060 --> 01:32:14.700
And well, I think that applies, again,

01:32:14.700 --> 01:32:19.180
to the example of the numbers, yes, the numbers,

01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:23.020
and to the example of the ordered pairs,

01:32:23.020 --> 01:32:29.020
that one has certain services that,

01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:32.660
in case the ordered pair is, I think, particularly

01:32:32.660 --> 01:32:35.620
conspicuous this way, because ordered pair isn't even

01:32:35.620 --> 01:32:39.420
a common sense notion to the extent that 1, 2, 3 are.

01:32:39.460 --> 01:32:44.580
And all that's wanted is something

01:32:44.580 --> 01:32:52.020
that is going to carry the individuality of both x and y,

01:32:52.020 --> 01:32:54.740
and not vice versa.

01:32:54.740 --> 01:32:57.540
And some further entity, then, in addition

01:32:57.540 --> 01:33:00.740
to the x and the y, anything will do.

01:33:00.740 --> 01:33:02.900
And then they cast it out and find, yeah,

01:33:02.900 --> 01:33:06.980
here's something it'll do.

01:33:06.980 --> 01:33:08.380
There's a little class of two members

01:33:08.420 --> 01:33:11.180
that's easy to describe.

01:33:11.180 --> 01:33:12.900
Not just the class of the members x and y,

01:33:12.900 --> 01:33:15.700
but a little more complicated.

01:33:15.700 --> 01:33:17.660
Someone else comes up with an equally simple one,

01:33:17.660 --> 01:33:20.420
but a different one, and that's a situation

01:33:20.420 --> 01:33:22.020
where it doesn't matter.

01:33:22.020 --> 01:33:24.340
You have this function, that function

01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:27.860
in the sense of service, not in the mathematical sense,

01:33:27.860 --> 01:33:33.660
to be performed, and anything will do in the pinch.

01:33:33.660 --> 01:33:36.860
And then the sweeping theory, finally,

01:33:37.420 --> 01:33:40.180
of ontological relativity is that that's

01:33:40.180 --> 01:33:41.180
the way with all reference.

01:33:44.380 --> 01:33:51.540
But what makes it, I'd say, counter-intuitive to all of us

01:33:51.540 --> 01:33:53.780
is when it's not a question of abstract objects anymore,

01:33:53.780 --> 01:34:02.220
like ordered pairs and numbers, but sensible objects.

01:34:03.100 --> 01:34:14.140
So this is where one has to consider, and keep in mind,

01:34:14.140 --> 01:34:18.180
that the sensory associations are undisturbed

01:34:18.180 --> 01:34:20.780
in all this reshuffling of objects

01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:25.740
in the course of ontological relativity,

01:34:25.740 --> 01:34:31.100
one-to-one reinterpretations.

01:34:31.540 --> 01:34:33.900
The sensory connotations remain.

01:34:33.900 --> 01:34:42.420
And when a body ends up being identified or supplanted,

01:34:42.420 --> 01:34:50.660
as you prefer, either way, by a class of quadruples of numbers,

01:34:50.660 --> 01:34:53.580
the sensory qualities of that body,

01:34:53.580 --> 01:34:56.220
the qualities by which you learned it

01:34:56.220 --> 01:34:58.860
through ostention or whatever, carry over

01:34:58.860 --> 01:35:04.460
to that class of quadruples of numbers.

01:35:10.180 --> 01:35:14.100
So it's a matter of shifting one's emphasis

01:35:14.100 --> 01:35:19.260
from the object to the sentence, ultimately

01:35:19.260 --> 01:35:21.980
to the observation sentences, as far as their objects

01:35:21.980 --> 01:35:25.340
that we've learned by ostention, objects whose names we've

01:35:25.340 --> 01:35:27.900
learned by ostention.

01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:30.260
And those go along unaffected.

01:35:30.260 --> 01:35:36.140
And what the theory of ontological relativity

01:35:36.140 --> 01:35:45.780
brings out is just that really the entity, the object hood,

01:35:45.780 --> 01:35:53.580
the object hood is not really what matters here.

01:35:53.820 --> 01:35:58.140
Two things that do matter are, one,

01:35:58.140 --> 01:36:02.900
all this bundle of sensory qualities

01:36:02.900 --> 01:36:06.140
to put the thing in mentalistic terms,

01:36:06.140 --> 01:36:09.580
all the association when it comes to a neural league

01:36:09.580 --> 01:36:13.660
with the sensory input.

01:36:13.660 --> 01:36:16.540
That's one of the two things that matter.

01:36:16.540 --> 01:36:20.620
And the other thing that matters is the role it plays,

01:36:20.620 --> 01:36:27.580
the service it performs as a node in the theoretical structure,

01:36:27.580 --> 01:36:30.260
the logical structure of the scientific theory.

01:36:30.260 --> 01:36:32.980
And then what the thesis of ontological relativity

01:36:32.980 --> 01:36:36.500
brings out is these are two separate purposes

01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:42.900
and can be separated, even be separated ontologically,

01:36:42.900 --> 01:36:46.100
in that the ontology can be reshuffled at will

01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:49.060
to within one to one for the one.

01:36:49.060 --> 01:36:56.660
And on the other hand, the sensory input stays put.

01:36:56.660 --> 01:37:01.340
In your long career as a teacher and professor,

01:37:01.340 --> 01:37:05.620
you must have encountered a great number of students

01:37:05.620 --> 01:37:09.100
who have gone on some within philosophy

01:37:09.100 --> 01:37:13.220
and some outside of philosophy to pursue careers.

01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:15.940
Does anyone in particular, or do any of them in particular,

01:37:15.940 --> 01:37:18.340
stand out in your mind as?

01:37:18.340 --> 01:37:19.260
Oh, yes, indeed.

01:37:19.260 --> 01:37:29.700
Of course, of the earlier ones, Donald Davidson,

01:37:29.700 --> 01:37:45.020
then in logic, there have been a few, certainly not so much

01:37:45.020 --> 01:37:48.100
of my students who have gone successfully

01:37:48.100 --> 01:37:50.380
into computer theory and the like.

01:37:50.380 --> 01:38:00.340
But philosophers, later generations,

01:38:00.340 --> 01:38:05.460
of course, I think of Doug Finfield Estelle and Roger

01:38:05.460 --> 01:38:13.260
Gibson, I'm mentioning ones that have gone on,

01:38:13.260 --> 01:38:17.340
carrying on more or less my point of view.
