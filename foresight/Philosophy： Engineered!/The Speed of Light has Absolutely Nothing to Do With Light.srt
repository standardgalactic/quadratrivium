1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
How many times has this happened to you?

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,940
You're watching one of those popular science programs when suddenly you're bombarded

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:11,880
with the outlandish claim that nothing travels faster than the speed of light.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,880
It's a common expression to be sure, and physicists love to remind us of this fact

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:20,840
at every opportunity, but how many times have those same science educators ever stop to

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,960
explain why this must be the case?

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,480
It's an insanely counter-intuitive thing to say, yet most educational resources seem

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,820
to just treat it as a brute fact of life, as if the universe itself is just really

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,160
quirky that way, so quit your whining and get used to it.

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,880
Even Einstein himself seems to just postulate it outright in his original work, and all

11
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,640
the laws of special relativity just happen to fall out of the mathematics once you do.

12
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,840
But what if I told you that it didn't have to be that way?

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,880
The universality of the speed of light is not some quirky foible we all have to live with.

14
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,720
Rather, it's a fundamental statement about the nature of space and time.

15
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,840
There's even a surprisingly simple proof of this fact, and it's been well-documented

16
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,240
in the literature for many decades.

17
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:09,120
Yet for some very strange reason, it never quite made its way into our textbooks.

18
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,080
Most popular science educators are therefore blissfully unaware of it, and they can't

19
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,720
help but spread confusing misinformation as a result.

20
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,120
It's a real shame, too, because the proof itself is surprisingly simple and elegant.

21
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,280
Anyone with a basic comprehension of calculus can replicate it for themselves, which means

22
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,560
you don't need an advanced degree to understand the argument.

23
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,280
Here's how it works.

24
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,200
I'd like to introduce you to the intrepid space explorer, Annie the Astronaut.

25
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,000
At this particular moment, Annie just so happens to be soaring through the furthest

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,840
reaches of outer space, far away from any massive objects like stars or planets.

27
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:50,400
As part of her mission mandate, Annie must catalog her encounters with any passing objects,

28
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,880
and she naturally accomplishes her task through the use of a very large and very sophisticated

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
meter stick.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,880
Furthermore, any time she measures the location of a passing object, she uses her on-board

31
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,600
clock to record the time at which it occurred.

32
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:10,200
The result is thus an ordered pair of numbers, x, t, which physicists refer to as an event.

33
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,920
Now let us imagine what would happen if a second space explorer, whom we'll call Jim,

34
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,120
just so happens to cruise on by.

35
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,160
Just like Annie, Jim is also charged with taking his own measurements, which means he

36
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,400
also has his own space age meter stick and on-board clock.

37
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,480
Jim, however, is moving with some velocity v relative to Annie.

38
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:34,160
Using the language of physics, we would therefore say that Jim travels in his own inertial frame

39
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,400
of reference.

40
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,000
Unsurprisingly, Jim therefore measures his events a little bit differently, and we can

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,400
represent his perspective through the coordinates x' and t'.

42
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,040
Finally, for the sake of personal convenience, we may further assume that Jim and Annie both

43
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,000
agree to synchronize their instruments at the moment their origins intersect, which

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,360
means they both agree to label that event as 00.

45
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,040
Now suppose that Annie and Jim both observe an event during their encounter.

46
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,000
Say a piece of nearby space rock happens to collide with another.

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,880
Naturally, Annie performs her measurement, which she records as the numbers x, t.

48
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:17,000
Likewise, Jim does the same thing from his perspective, resulting in x', t'.

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,500
So far so good, right?

50
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,980
But this raises an interesting question.

51
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:26,420
Given Annie's measurement of some event, x, t, plus her velocity v relative to Jim,

52
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:33,100
is it possible to calculate Jim's measurement, x', t', of the same event?

53
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:38,340
This kind of calculation has a name in physics, and it is called a transformation.

54
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:43,300
And at first glance, it almost comes across as a boringly trivial thing to ask, doesn't

55
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,300
it?

56
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,980
Yet that's exactly what makes this thought experiment so beautiful.

57
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,980
It just feels like the result ought to be intuitively dull.

58
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:56,460
But let's suppose, just for the sake of argument, that we know nothing whatsoever about the

59
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,100
underlying nature of space, time, or motion.

60
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,980
What minimal set of assumptions do we require in order to generate a unique solution that

61
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,100
also jives with our everyday experience?

62
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:12,420
Not many people realize it, but this simple question is the foundation of Einstein's

63
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,500
theory of special relativity.

64
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,620
It's such a deceptively boring question, too, that most people would never even think

65
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,620
to ask it.

66
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,980
At the moment we take the time to walk through it, we are immediately forced to abandon every

67
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:28,140
naive intuition we ever had about the nature of space and time.

68
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:32,100
So by all means, get out a pen and a piece of paper and follow along.

69
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:37,100
All you need is a basic understanding of high school mathematics, and you too can see for

70
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:43,820
yourself why the speed of light must be a universal constant that no one can exceed.

71
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,340
The transformation is a function of space and time.

72
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,100
That's not so bad, right?

73
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,060
After all, the whole point of this thought experiment is to transform from Annie's coordinates

74
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,140
into Jim's.

75
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:59,580
It also tells us that we can ignore such factors as the temperature of the meter stick and

76
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,820
the metallic composition of the clocks.

77
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:05,780
Presumably, these sorts of things can be controlled for, so they should not have any effect on

78
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,140
the transformation anyway.

79
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:12,460
It is also conceivable that space itself exhibits some kind of weird hysteresis effect, such

80
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:16,420
that there are multiple possible outcomes for any given transformation.

81
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:21,060
In practice, however, none of this stuff has ever been observed, so we may reasonably assume

82
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,020
that it won't be an issue here.

83
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,220
Assumption number two.

84
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:29,820
The laws of physics are identical in all inertial frames of reference.

85
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:34,940
This is known as the principle of relativity, and it is a cornerstone of our entire understanding

86
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,860
of motion through space and time.

87
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:41,540
Basically, it tells us that there is no reason to think Annie's frame of reference is fundamentally

88
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,020
different from Jim's.

89
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:47,860
Presumably, the universe does not care that Annie is 4 feet to the left of Jim or 100

90
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,140
miles to the right.

91
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:55,060
It does not care if an event occurs at 3.32 pm versus 11.54 am, nor does it distinguish

92
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:59,260
between Jim's motion to the right versus Annie's motion to the left.

93
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:03,940
Both observers feel as if they're the ones at rest, while the other is the one moving.

94
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:08,520
One important consequence of this assumption is that any experiment performed in one frame

95
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,120
of reference must yield the same result when performed in the other.

96
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,760
For example, suppose Annie holds up two magnets and measures the force between them.

97
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,580
Then for whatever reason, Jim happens to replicate that exact same experiment in his own cockpit

98
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,920
an hour later.

99
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:28,640
All other things being equal, it seems natural to expect that Jim's result should perfectly

100
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,160
replicate Annie's.

101
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,160
It simply shouldn't matter that Jim is 9,000 meters away or that he's moving to Annie's

102
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,800
left at 50 meters per second or that he's doing his experiment on a Tuesday morning.

103
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,160
The universe does not care where you are, what time it is, or what direction you happen

104
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,160
to be moving.

105
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,720
The magnets should behave exactly the same in all instances.

106
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,400
Assumption number three, the law of inertia.

107
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,720
An object in motion shall remain in motion, and it shall travel along a straight line

108
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,160
trajectory unless acted upon by an external force.

109
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,320
Easy, right?

110
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,440
Now let's see what we can deduce from these basic assumptions.

111
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:10,300
To begin, imagine a piece of floating space rock that happens to move past Annie's spaceship.

112
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,920
From her point of view, she observes the rock casually floating on by with some constant

113
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,980
velocity in accordance with the law of inertia.

114
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:22,800
For convenience, let's call this velocity u sub zero just to avoid any confusion with

115
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,480
Jim's relative velocity v.

116
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,920
Thus, using the language of calculus, we would say that the derivative of the rock's position

117
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,920
x with respect to time t is equal to u sub zero.

118
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,600
Now let's consider the same encounter from Jim's perspective.

119
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,760
According to the law of inertia, Jim also observes the same rock moving along with some

120
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,200
constant velocity.

121
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:49,400
Jim, however, is also moving with some constant velocity v relative to Annie, which means

122
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,160
his measurement of the rock's velocity yields a different value.

123
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,840
Thus, we have a slightly different expression for Jim, which is written as the derivative

124
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,400
of x prime with respect to t prime is equal to u sub zero prime.

125
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,920
Now watch what happens when we take the derivative with respect to Annie's position.

126
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:13,160
According to the law of inertia, the rock's velocity u sub zero prime is a constant throughout

127
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,320
space and time, and so the derivative naturally evaluates to zero.

128
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:21,960
If we then swap the denominators and calculate the antiderivative, we quickly find that

129
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:28,040
the derivative of x prime with respect to x is some unknown constant a.

130
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,360
This result should feel perfectly intuitive.

131
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,640
All it says is that, given some tiny change in the rock's position from Jim's perspective,

132
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,560
Annie observes some proportional change in position from her perspective.

133
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:44,040
If we then take the ratio of these two changes, we get a constant value that does not depend

134
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,560
on space or time.

135
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:50,440
If we then repeat this argument three more times, we get three more ratios for a total

136
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,480
of four unknown constants.

137
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,120
Now let's take the antiderivative of the first two expressions.

138
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,920
The first case tells us that x prime is equal to a times x plus t of t, where big t of t

139
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,520
is just some arbitrary function of Annie's time coordinate.

140
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:12,400
The second case then tells us that x prime is equal to big x of x plus b times t, where

141
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,920
big x of x is just some other arbitrary function of Annie's spatial coordinate.

142
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,320
If we then compare these expressions side by side, it is easy to see that there is only

143
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,400
one possible solution.

144
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,160
X prime is equal to a times x plus b times t.

145
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,880
Finally, we repeat the same argument with Jim's time coordinate, t prime, and we find

146
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,640
that t prime is equal to c times x plus d times t.

147
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,680
Looking at these two expressions side by side, we should immediately see that the transformation

148
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,360
from Annie's frame of reference into Jim's takes on a linear structure.

149
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,760
That is to say, it is a linear transformation expressed by a system of linear equations.

150
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,120
And that just feels intuitive, doesn't it?

151
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,880
Lots of things in nature are linear, so of course it should come as no surprise that

152
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,240
our result should take on this simple structure.

153
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,640
And since the structure is linear, we should immediately feel inclined to express this

154
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,160
relationship using standard matrix vector notation.

155
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,040
That is, after all, what matrix vector algebra was specifically designed to handle.

156
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,360
By the way, if you're not familiar with matrix vector notation, then feel free to pause now

157
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,360
and look it up.

158
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,840
It's important to be comfortable with this stuff as we move forward.

159
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:24,040
One major advantage to this formulation is that it allows us to easily calculate the

160
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,720
inverse transformation from Jim's frame of reference back into Annie's.

161
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:34,040
This is accomplished by calculating the matrix inverse, which leads to the following expression.

162
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,520
Note that the little delta here simply represents the determinant of the matrix, which is defined

163
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,440
as AD minus BC for a 2 by 2 matrix.

164
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:48,200
All that remains for us now is to derive the four mystery coefficients within the matrix.

165
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,440
To that end, consider what would happen if Annie measures Jim's location.

166
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:58,400
Again, by the law of inertia, she has to observe a straight line trajectory satisfying x equals

167
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,920
v times t.

168
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:05,760
By definition, however, this same location also corresponds to Jim's origin at x prime

169
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,000
equals zero.

170
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,080
Let us therefore substitute this information directly into the transformation for x prime,

171
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:17,360
such that x prime equals zero, which is equal to AVT plus BT.

172
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,840
A little bit of algebra later, and we now find that the constant b must satisfy b equals

173
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,400
negative a times v.

174
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,160
Let us further imagine the exact same situation in reverse.

175
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:34,280
That is to say, Jim measures Annie's position from his perspective, which he naturally observes

176
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,840
as x prime equals negative vt prime.

177
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:42,640
In other words, he sees the exact same thing that Annie did, but in the opposite direction.

178
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:48,440
Again, by definition, this corresponds to Annie's origin at x equals zero, and so the

179
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:53,120
transformation from Jim's frame of reference follows a similar argument.

180
00:11:53,120 --> 00:12:00,040
Zero is equal to 1 over delta times the quantity of negative dvt prime minus BT prime.

181
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:06,320
A little bit more algebra, and we soon find that d is equal to negative b over v, which

182
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,200
is equal to a.

183
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,960
In other words, the two elements along the main diagonal must be the same.

184
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:17,080
The transformation from Annie's frame of reference into Jim's can therefore be written

185
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,680
as follows.

186
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:24,760
Next, suppose that Annie decides to measure some arbitrary time interval with her clock.

187
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:29,720
Say the time t in seconds that it takes for her heart to beat 10 times.

188
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:35,120
From Jim's perspective, this event must transform to the location x equals zero, and so it

189
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,160
appears to last a time interval of t prime equals a times t seconds.

190
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,560
But what exactly should we expect to happen if we perform the same experiment in reverse?

191
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:50,320
That is to say, Jim measures the time it takes for his heart to beat 10 times, and he also

192
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,320
finds that it takes exactly t seconds.

193
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:58,960
Meanwhile, Annie cruises on by in her spaceship, and she observes a time interval of t equals

194
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,800
a t over delta.

195
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,200
According to the principle of relativity, there is no reason for Annie's frame of reference

196
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,840
to behave any differently from Jim's.

197
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:12,760
That means Annie must observe the same time interval as Jim did when the situation was

198
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,960
reversed.

199
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:18,480
In other words, Annie's measurement t is necessarily the same as Jim's measurement

200
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,720
t prime.

201
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:25,360
This forces us to conclude a t equals a t over delta, from which it immediately follows

202
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,480
that the determinant delta equals one.

203
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,920
The inverse transformation from Jim's frame of reference back into Annie's can therefore

204
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,440
be written like this.

205
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,800
At this point, it helps to do a little bit of rearrangement on the transformation.

206
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,000
Note that this is not imposing any assumptions, but simply cleaning up the expression so

207
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,040
that it better matches our modern conventions.

208
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,240
To begin, let's factor out the coefficient a, and then rename it to the Greek letter

209
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,520
gamma.

210
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:57,640
This little guy is called the Lorentz factor, and it is easily the most important parameter

211
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,320
in all of relativity.

212
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:04,800
In doing so, however, we also encounter another little factor of c divided by a.

213
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,560
And since this is just some constant number divided by yet another constant number, it

214
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,040
is likewise nothing more than some arbitrary constant number.

215
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,040
Thus, for lack of anything better to call it, let us simply replace it with the letter

216
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,040
f.

217
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,920
Our updated transformation now looks like this.

218
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,920
We are now ready to introduce a fourth assumption into our hypothetical universe.

219
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,560
All coordinate transformations must form a mathematical group.

220
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,760
For those of you unfamiliar with group theory, this may sound a little strange, but I promise

221
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,280
it's actually perfectly sensible.

222
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:44,840
In this case, all it says is that a transformation acting upon another transformation must likewise

223
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,280
be a transformation.

224
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,000
Here is how it works.

225
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,160
Suppose a third observer, whom we'll call Carl, happens to pass on by.

226
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:59,160
Annie therefore observes Jim, moving to the right with velocity v1, and Carl, moving along

227
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,400
with velocity v2.

228
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,880
If however, we were to transform to Jim's perspective, then he naturally observes things

229
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,400
slightly differently.

230
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:13,240
As expected, he sees Annie moving along with some velocity v1' and Carl moving along with

231
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,400
some different velocity, which we'll call v2'.

232
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:21,880
Finally, if we transform into Carl's perspective, then he naturally sees things differently

233
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,920
yet again, which we can indicate using the double-primed coordinates.

234
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:32,760
Carl therefore sees Annie moving along with some velocity v1' and he sees Jim moving along

235
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:38,000
with some other velocity, which we'll call v2'

236
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,200
Now let us impose the condition of a mathematical group.

237
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:46,960
A transformation from Annie to Jim, followed by yet another transformation from Jim to

238
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:52,440
Carl, should naturally be the same as a direct transformation from Annie to Carl.

239
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:57,000
We now multiply the two matrices together, yielding a new transformation which looks

240
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,720
like this.

241
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,040
This thing may look complicated at first glance, but it really isn't that bad.

242
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,400
Remember that all we care about is the simple fact that this new expression needs to obey

243
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,600
the rules of a transformation.

244
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:15,120
That includes all properties of transformations which we have already discovered thus far,

245
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,560
which includes the condition that the two main diagonal elements must be the same.

246
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:27,760
In other words, 1-f1v2' is equal to 1-f2'v1.

247
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:33,280
Again we do a little bit of algebra and we quickly find that v1 over f1 is equal to

248
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,880
v2' over f2'

249
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,400
This may not look like much, but it's actually a very peculiar result.

250
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:46,760
Remember, the relative velocities between Annie, Jim, and Carl are completely arbitrary.

251
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,240
We're the ones in charge of this thought experiment, which means we can easily set

252
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,480
them to any values we like.

253
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,200
For example, I could hypothetically double the value of v1 while simultaneously leaving

254
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:02,360
v2' untouched and this equality still has to hold.

255
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:07,680
Yet if you look closely, the right side of this equation does not depend on v1 at all,

256
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,760
which means it cannot possibly change no matter what values I pick.

257
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,360
How can this be the case?

258
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:18,440
The only way to reconcile this contradiction is for both ratios to evaluate to some universal

259
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:22,120
constant that does not depend on either velocity.

260
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:26,560
And since we have no idea what that constant is, I'm just going to assign it another random

261
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,600
letter like, I don't know, a.

262
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:37,560
We therefore have v1 over f1 is equal to v2' over f2' which is equal to a.

263
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:43,800
Remember, this relationship must be true for any arbitrary coordinate transformation.

264
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:51,080
Therefore, our original transformation from Annie to Jim must likewise obey the same rule.

265
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:58,360
That little constant f must therefore evaluate to v over a for all coordinate transformations.

266
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:02,840
That leaves us with a new transformation which looks like this.

267
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:07,240
Now let's take a moment to remind ourselves of another useful fact that was already derived

268
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,240
earlier.

269
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,600
Namely, that the determinant of any transformation matrix must equal one no matter whose frame

270
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,800
of reference it happens to represent.

271
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:20,840
A little bit more algebra later, and we find that our mysterious Lorentz factor must evaluate

272
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,760
to the following.

273
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:27,280
We are therefore left with a coordinate transformation that finally looks like this.

274
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:32,120
Clearly, the only parameter we have left to make sense out of is that little mysterious

275
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,120
constant a.

276
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,080
So let's take a moment to think about what exactly that thing represents.

277
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,560
For starters, the astute observer might notice that a just so happens to have units of velocity

278
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,560
squared.

279
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:48,960
That's a little odd, but it does motivate us to rewrite a in terms of a new velocity

280
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:55,200
constant which we'll call c such that a is equal to plus or minus c squared.

281
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:01,000
Not exactly this magical velocity represents, we cannot yet say, but clearly there are only

282
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,480
three possible scenarios to consider.

283
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:09,160
Either a is equal to zero, thus implying c equals zero, a is positive implying that

284
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:15,440
a is equal to positive c squared, or a is negative implying that a is equal to negative

285
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,840
c squared.

286
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,880
So let's consider each of these cases one by one.

287
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:24,920
Well, clearly we can immediately reject the first option outright because all it would

288
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,880
do is introduce a bunch of divisions by zero.

289
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:33,280
The second option is likewise not physically viable, but the reason is not quite as obvious.

290
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,800
It begins by asking what would happen if Annie observes Jim traveling to the right with some

291
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,760
modest velocity like v is equal to c over 10.

292
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,800
Meanwhile, Jim observes Carl, who is likewise traveling to the right with the same relative

293
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,920
velocity of c over 10.

294
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:54,600
Carl, in turn, observes yet another traveler with velocity c over 10 who observes another

295
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,400
who observes another and so on.

296
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:02,960
Now suppose that Annie measures her heartbeat and observes a delay of exactly t equals one

297
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,160
second.

298
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:08,440
From Jim's perspective, he likewise observes Annie's heartbeat, and he naturally measures

299
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,080
some duration t prime from his frame of reference.

300
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:17,120
Carl then measures a value of t double prime and so on for every other observer down the

301
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,120
train.

302
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:22,400
But what exactly should we expect to happen if we simply repeated this transformation

303
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,960
a hundred times over?

304
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,200
The answer, it turns out, is a little strange.

305
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,000
Given enough transformations, Annie's heartbeat will actually appear to flow in the negative

306
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,400
direction, as in literally, the observers will eventually perceive Annie's flow of time

307
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,720
as moving backwards.

308
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,840
Well obviously, that cannot possibly be the case, so let's introduce a fifth assumption

309
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,640
into our universe.

310
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:56,960
For any two events, x1, t1, and x2, t2, if x2 equals x1 and t2 is greater than t1, then

311
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:03,560
all transformations must likewise result in t2 prime greater than t1 prime.

312
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:09,680
In other words, all observers must agree that time tends to move forwards for certain durations.

313
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:14,160
This condition immediately removes the second option from our list, leaving behind only

314
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,360
one logical possibility.

315
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:21,320
Our final transformation therefore must take on the following structure.

316
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:27,040
Finally, let us remove the matrix vector notation and write the transformation in its standard

317
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,280
form.

318
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:33,120
This expression has a name in physics, and it is called the Lorentz transformation.

319
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,520
It is also an incredible result when you think about it.

320
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:41,080
Remember that we started this thought experiment by asking a seemingly trivial question and

321
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,840
expecting a trivial result.

322
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:48,040
Yet of all the different mathematical possibilities we could have imagined for transforming between

323
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:53,280
inertial frames of reference, this is the only one that is consistent with our assumptions.

324
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,240
Besides, it's not like we demanded anything extraordinary either.

325
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:02,840
We're talking about stupidly basic assumptions like the law of inertia and the tendency for

326
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,880
time to move forward.

327
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,800
It simply cannot be any other way without the universe suddenly exploding into a bunch

328
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,680
of really bizarre manifestations.

329
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:18,360
Notice also how the word light was never mentioned a single time throughout this entire derivation.

330
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:24,520
If anything, the very phrase itself, the speed of light, is nothing but a blundering misnomer.

331
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:30,880
That little mystery constant C has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with photons or electromagnetic

332
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,880
radiation.

333
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:37,480
It's a fundamental statement about the interplay between space, time, and motion.

334
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,560
That's why many physicists prefer not to use the phrase speed of light.

335
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:46,040
If anything, a far more appropriate name is something like the speed of causality in

336
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:50,520
that it represents the fastest possible speed at which any single event can ever appear

337
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,920
to causally influence another.

338
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,520
But wait, I hear you asking.

339
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,320
Who says I can't travel faster than light?

340
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,720
Surely, all I have to do is hop into a spaceship and gun the engines.

341
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,920
Sooner or later, I have to exceed the speed of light, don't I?

342
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,680
But will you?

343
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:13,440
After again, that little piece of space rock floating by from Annie's perspective.

344
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:19,720
According to the law of inertia, Annie necessarily observes a velocity of dx dt equals u sub

345
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,720
zero.

346
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:27,600
Now ask yourself, what velocity, u sub zero prime, Jim should expect to see from his perspective?

347
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,760
The answer is actually perfectly straightforward.

348
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,840
First, we use implicit differentiation to derive the following expressions.

349
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:39,600
Next, we simply divide the one by the other to find this.

350
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,960
Remember that by definition, this quantity has to represent the transformed velocity

351
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,320
u sub zero prime from Jim's perspective.

352
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:54,240
Likewise, the quantity dx dt represents the relative velocity u sub zero between Annie

353
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:00,080
and the rock, which means we finally arrive at this expression here.

354
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,360
This is the famous velocity addition formula of special relativity, and you can clearly

355
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,960
see for yourself that velocities do not add linearly.

356
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:15,760
It seems strange and counterintuitive, but it is also the only way to preserve a well-behaved

357
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,840
universe that obeys our assumptions.

358
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,520
Consider again that long train of observers all moving past each other with some relative

359
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,560
velocity of c over 10.

360
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:31,400
You would think that eventually some observer will see that little piece of space rock zooming

361
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,760
off faster than the speed of light, but do they really?

362
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,920
Just try it for yourself and graph the result.

363
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,640
This is what you'll see.

364
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,040
Isn't that weird?

365
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:46,360
No matter how many times we repeat the transformation, the velocity of that little piece of space

366
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,400
rock will never exceed the mystery constant c.

367
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,960
In fact, if we let the velocity equal c itself, then all observers in all inertial frames of

368
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:00,560
reference will likewise agree that it is moving exactly that fast.

369
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:06,600
That is to say, if any observer measures an object moving with speed c, then all observers

370
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,200
must likewise measure a speed of c.

371
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,800
Again, this has to be the case because it is the only logical outcome that is consistent

372
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,200
with the assumptions we've made.

373
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,440
This is exactly why physicists are so confident in the idea of a universal speed limit.

374
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,560
It's not just a matter of, oh well, the evidence seems to indicate it.

375
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:30,200
It logically cannot be any other way.

376
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:35,200
Any universe that allows for objects to move beyond some universal speed limit would completely

377
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,400
violate our most basic presumptions about space, time, and motion.

378
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:43,760
It is therefore not a matter of hopping into a spaceship and firing the engines.

379
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,280
The very geometry of the universe itself doesn't allow it.

380
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:52,280
So what exactly is the value of that universal speed limit anyway?

381
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,960
To answer that question, you just have to start doing some basic experiments.

382
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:05,120
In our particular universe, it just so happens to be 299,792,458 meters per second.

383
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,000
A very large number.

384
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,760
So large, in fact, that we can usually approximate it as infinite and still get reliably good

385
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,080
results.

386
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:18,040
Letting c approach infinity thus leads us to the following transformation.

387
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:22,880
These equations are known as the Galilean transformation, and they finally represent

388
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,960
the simple, intuitive answer that we were originally expecting to find when we first

389
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,800
began this exercise.

390
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:35,120
But isn't it interesting that we practically had to trip over the correct Lorentzian transformation

391
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,400
just to get here?

392
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:42,480
Not to mention impose the highly dubious assumption of infinite value for that mystery constant.

393
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,640
It all just goes to show that you never know what you might discover if only you take the

394
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:52,720
time to enumerate a few basic assumptions and then follow the argument wherever it leads.

395
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,600
Thank you for watching.
