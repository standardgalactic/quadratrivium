0	3040	How many times has this happened to you?
3040	6940	You're watching one of those popular science programs when suddenly you're bombarded
6940	11880	with the outlandish claim that nothing travels faster than the speed of light.
11880	15880	It's a common expression to be sure, and physicists love to remind us of this fact
15880	20840	at every opportunity, but how many times have those same science educators ever stop to
20840	23960	explain why this must be the case?
23960	28480	It's an insanely counter-intuitive thing to say, yet most educational resources seem
28480	32820	to just treat it as a brute fact of life, as if the universe itself is just really
32820	36160	quirky that way, so quit your whining and get used to it.
36160	40880	Even Einstein himself seems to just postulate it outright in his original work, and all
40880	45640	the laws of special relativity just happen to fall out of the mathematics once you do.
45640	48840	But what if I told you that it didn't have to be that way?
48840	53880	The universality of the speed of light is not some quirky foible we all have to live with.
53880	57720	Rather, it's a fundamental statement about the nature of space and time.
57920	61840	There's even a surprisingly simple proof of this fact, and it's been well-documented
61840	64240	in the literature for many decades.
64240	69120	Yet for some very strange reason, it never quite made its way into our textbooks.
69120	73080	Most popular science educators are therefore blissfully unaware of it, and they can't
73080	75720	help but spread confusing misinformation as a result.
75720	81120	It's a real shame, too, because the proof itself is surprisingly simple and elegant.
81120	85280	Anyone with a basic comprehension of calculus can replicate it for themselves, which means
85360	89560	you don't need an advanced degree to understand the argument.
89560	91280	Here's how it works.
91280	96200	I'd like to introduce you to the intrepid space explorer, Annie the Astronaut.
96200	100000	At this particular moment, Annie just so happens to be soaring through the furthest
100000	104840	reaches of outer space, far away from any massive objects like stars or planets.
104840	110400	As part of her mission mandate, Annie must catalog her encounters with any passing objects,
110400	114880	and she naturally accomplishes her task through the use of a very large and very sophisticated
115000	116000	meter stick.
116000	120880	Furthermore, any time she measures the location of a passing object, she uses her on-board
120880	123600	clock to record the time at which it occurred.
123600	130200	The result is thus an ordered pair of numbers, x, t, which physicists refer to as an event.
130200	134920	Now let us imagine what would happen if a second space explorer, whom we'll call Jim,
134920	137120	just so happens to cruise on by.
137120	141160	Just like Annie, Jim is also charged with taking his own measurements, which means he
141160	145400	also has his own space age meter stick and on-board clock.
145400	149480	Jim, however, is moving with some velocity v relative to Annie.
149480	154160	Using the language of physics, we would therefore say that Jim travels in his own inertial frame
154160	155400	of reference.
155400	160000	Unsurprisingly, Jim therefore measures his events a little bit differently, and we can
160000	164400	represent his perspective through the coordinates x' and t'.
164400	169040	Finally, for the sake of personal convenience, we may further assume that Jim and Annie both
169040	173000	agree to synchronize their instruments at the moment their origins intersect, which
173000	177360	means they both agree to label that event as 00.
177360	182040	Now suppose that Annie and Jim both observe an event during their encounter.
182040	186000	Say a piece of nearby space rock happens to collide with another.
186000	190880	Naturally, Annie performs her measurement, which she records as the numbers x, t.
190880	197000	Likewise, Jim does the same thing from his perspective, resulting in x', t'.
197000	198500	So far so good, right?
198500	200980	But this raises an interesting question.
200980	206420	Given Annie's measurement of some event, x, t, plus her velocity v relative to Jim,
206420	213100	is it possible to calculate Jim's measurement, x', t', of the same event?
213100	218340	This kind of calculation has a name in physics, and it is called a transformation.
218340	223300	And at first glance, it almost comes across as a boringly trivial thing to ask, doesn't
223300	224300	it?
224300	227980	Yet that's exactly what makes this thought experiment so beautiful.
227980	231980	It just feels like the result ought to be intuitively dull.
231980	236460	But let's suppose, just for the sake of argument, that we know nothing whatsoever about the
236460	240100	underlying nature of space, time, or motion.
240100	244980	What minimal set of assumptions do we require in order to generate a unique solution that
244980	248100	also jives with our everyday experience?
248100	252420	Not many people realize it, but this simple question is the foundation of Einstein's
252420	254500	theory of special relativity.
254620	258620	It's such a deceptively boring question, too, that most people would never even think
258620	259620	to ask it.
259620	263980	At the moment we take the time to walk through it, we are immediately forced to abandon every
263980	268140	naive intuition we ever had about the nature of space and time.
268140	272100	So by all means, get out a pen and a piece of paper and follow along.
272100	277100	All you need is a basic understanding of high school mathematics, and you too can see for
277100	283820	yourself why the speed of light must be a universal constant that no one can exceed.
284820	288340	The transformation is a function of space and time.
288340	290100	That's not so bad, right?
290100	294060	After all, the whole point of this thought experiment is to transform from Annie's coordinates
294060	295140	into Jim's.
295140	299580	It also tells us that we can ignore such factors as the temperature of the meter stick and
299580	301820	the metallic composition of the clocks.
301820	305780	Presumably, these sorts of things can be controlled for, so they should not have any effect on
305780	307140	the transformation anyway.
307140	312460	It is also conceivable that space itself exhibits some kind of weird hysteresis effect, such
312460	316420	that there are multiple possible outcomes for any given transformation.
316420	321060	In practice, however, none of this stuff has ever been observed, so we may reasonably assume
321060	324020	that it won't be an issue here.
324020	325220	Assumption number two.
325220	329820	The laws of physics are identical in all inertial frames of reference.
329820	334940	This is known as the principle of relativity, and it is a cornerstone of our entire understanding
334940	336860	of motion through space and time.
336860	341540	Basically, it tells us that there is no reason to think Annie's frame of reference is fundamentally
341540	343020	different from Jim's.
343020	347860	Presumably, the universe does not care that Annie is 4 feet to the left of Jim or 100
347860	349140	miles to the right.
349140	355060	It does not care if an event occurs at 3.32 pm versus 11.54 am, nor does it distinguish
355060	359260	between Jim's motion to the right versus Annie's motion to the left.
359260	363940	Both observers feel as if they're the ones at rest, while the other is the one moving.
363940	368520	One important consequence of this assumption is that any experiment performed in one frame
368520	373120	of reference must yield the same result when performed in the other.
373120	377760	For example, suppose Annie holds up two magnets and measures the force between them.
377760	382580	Then for whatever reason, Jim happens to replicate that exact same experiment in his own cockpit
382580	383920	an hour later.
383920	388640	All other things being equal, it seems natural to expect that Jim's result should perfectly
388640	390160	replicate Annie's.
390160	394160	It simply shouldn't matter that Jim is 9,000 meters away or that he's moving to Annie's
394160	398800	left at 50 meters per second or that he's doing his experiment on a Tuesday morning.
398800	403160	The universe does not care where you are, what time it is, or what direction you happen
403160	404160	to be moving.
404160	408720	The magnets should behave exactly the same in all instances.
408720	411400	Assumption number three, the law of inertia.
411400	415720	An object in motion shall remain in motion, and it shall travel along a straight line
415720	419160	trajectory unless acted upon by an external force.
419160	420320	Easy, right?
420320	424440	Now let's see what we can deduce from these basic assumptions.
424440	430300	To begin, imagine a piece of floating space rock that happens to move past Annie's spaceship.
430300	434920	From her point of view, she observes the rock casually floating on by with some constant
434920	437980	velocity in accordance with the law of inertia.
437980	442800	For convenience, let's call this velocity u sub zero just to avoid any confusion with
442800	445480	Jim's relative velocity v.
445600	449920	Thus, using the language of calculus, we would say that the derivative of the rock's position
449920	454920	x with respect to time t is equal to u sub zero.
454920	458600	Now let's consider the same encounter from Jim's perspective.
458600	462760	According to the law of inertia, Jim also observes the same rock moving along with some
462760	464200	constant velocity.
464200	469400	Jim, however, is also moving with some constant velocity v relative to Annie, which means
469400	473160	his measurement of the rock's velocity yields a different value.
473160	477840	Thus, we have a slightly different expression for Jim, which is written as the derivative
477840	483400	of x prime with respect to t prime is equal to u sub zero prime.
483400	487920	Now watch what happens when we take the derivative with respect to Annie's position.
487920	493160	According to the law of inertia, the rock's velocity u sub zero prime is a constant throughout
493160	497320	space and time, and so the derivative naturally evaluates to zero.
497320	501960	If we then swap the denominators and calculate the antiderivative, we quickly find that
501960	508040	the derivative of x prime with respect to x is some unknown constant a.
508040	510360	This result should feel perfectly intuitive.
510360	515640	All it says is that, given some tiny change in the rock's position from Jim's perspective,
515640	519560	Annie observes some proportional change in position from her perspective.
519560	524040	If we then take the ratio of these two changes, we get a constant value that does not depend
524040	525560	on space or time.
525560	530440	If we then repeat this argument three more times, we get three more ratios for a total
530440	533480	of four unknown constants.
533480	537120	Now let's take the antiderivative of the first two expressions.
537120	542920	The first case tells us that x prime is equal to a times x plus t of t, where big t of t
542920	546520	is just some arbitrary function of Annie's time coordinate.
546520	552400	The second case then tells us that x prime is equal to big x of x plus b times t, where
552400	556920	big x of x is just some other arbitrary function of Annie's spatial coordinate.
557080	561320	If we then compare these expressions side by side, it is easy to see that there is only
561320	563400	one possible solution.
563400	567160	X prime is equal to a times x plus b times t.
567160	571880	Finally, we repeat the same argument with Jim's time coordinate, t prime, and we find
571880	576640	that t prime is equal to c times x plus d times t.
576640	580680	Looking at these two expressions side by side, we should immediately see that the transformation
580680	585360	from Annie's frame of reference into Jim's takes on a linear structure.
585360	590760	That is to say, it is a linear transformation expressed by a system of linear equations.
590760	593120	And that just feels intuitive, doesn't it?
593120	596880	Lots of things in nature are linear, so of course it should come as no surprise that
596880	599240	our result should take on this simple structure.
599240	602640	And since the structure is linear, we should immediately feel inclined to express this
602640	606160	relationship using standard matrix vector notation.
606160	611040	That is, after all, what matrix vector algebra was specifically designed to handle.
611040	615360	By the way, if you're not familiar with matrix vector notation, then feel free to pause now
615360	616360	and look it up.
616360	619840	It's important to be comfortable with this stuff as we move forward.
619840	624040	One major advantage to this formulation is that it allows us to easily calculate the
624040	628720	inverse transformation from Jim's frame of reference back into Annie's.
628720	634040	This is accomplished by calculating the matrix inverse, which leads to the following expression.
634040	638520	Note that the little delta here simply represents the determinant of the matrix, which is defined
638520	642440	as AD minus BC for a 2 by 2 matrix.
642440	648200	All that remains for us now is to derive the four mystery coefficients within the matrix.
648200	652440	To that end, consider what would happen if Annie measures Jim's location.
652440	658400	Again, by the law of inertia, she has to observe a straight line trajectory satisfying x equals
658400	659920	v times t.
659920	665760	By definition, however, this same location also corresponds to Jim's origin at x prime
665760	667000	equals zero.
667000	672080	Let us therefore substitute this information directly into the transformation for x prime,
672080	677360	such that x prime equals zero, which is equal to AVT plus BT.
677360	682840	A little bit of algebra later, and we now find that the constant b must satisfy b equals
682840	685400	negative a times v.
685400	689160	Let us further imagine the exact same situation in reverse.
689160	694280	That is to say, Jim measures Annie's position from his perspective, which he naturally observes
694280	697840	as x prime equals negative vt prime.
697840	702640	In other words, he sees the exact same thing that Annie did, but in the opposite direction.
702640	708440	Again, by definition, this corresponds to Annie's origin at x equals zero, and so the
708440	713120	transformation from Jim's frame of reference follows a similar argument.
713120	720040	Zero is equal to 1 over delta times the quantity of negative dvt prime minus BT prime.
720040	726320	A little bit more algebra, and we soon find that d is equal to negative b over v, which
726320	728200	is equal to a.
728200	732960	In other words, the two elements along the main diagonal must be the same.
732960	737080	The transformation from Annie's frame of reference into Jim's can therefore be written
737080	738680	as follows.
738680	744760	Next, suppose that Annie decides to measure some arbitrary time interval with her clock.
744760	749720	Say the time t in seconds that it takes for her heart to beat 10 times.
749720	755120	From Jim's perspective, this event must transform to the location x equals zero, and so it
755120	760160	appears to last a time interval of t prime equals a times t seconds.
760160	765560	But what exactly should we expect to happen if we perform the same experiment in reverse?
765560	770320	That is to say, Jim measures the time it takes for his heart to beat 10 times, and he also
770320	773320	finds that it takes exactly t seconds.
773320	778960	Meanwhile, Annie cruises on by in her spaceship, and she observes a time interval of t equals
778960	780800	a t over delta.
780800	785200	According to the principle of relativity, there is no reason for Annie's frame of reference
785200	787840	to behave any differently from Jim's.
787840	792760	That means Annie must observe the same time interval as Jim did when the situation was
792760	793960	reversed.
793960	798480	In other words, Annie's measurement t is necessarily the same as Jim's measurement
798480	799720	t prime.
799720	805360	This forces us to conclude a t equals a t over delta, from which it immediately follows
805360	808480	that the determinant delta equals one.
808480	812920	The inverse transformation from Jim's frame of reference back into Annie's can therefore
812920	815440	be written like this.
815440	819800	At this point, it helps to do a little bit of rearrangement on the transformation.
819800	824000	Note that this is not imposing any assumptions, but simply cleaning up the expression so
824000	827040	that it better matches our modern conventions.
827040	831240	To begin, let's factor out the coefficient a, and then rename it to the Greek letter
831240	832520	gamma.
832520	837640	This little guy is called the Lorentz factor, and it is easily the most important parameter
837640	839320	in all of relativity.
839320	844800	In doing so, however, we also encounter another little factor of c divided by a.
844800	849560	And since this is just some constant number divided by yet another constant number, it
849560	853040	is likewise nothing more than some arbitrary constant number.
853040	857040	Thus, for lack of anything better to call it, let us simply replace it with the letter
857040	858040	f.
858040	861920	Our updated transformation now looks like this.
861920	866920	We are now ready to introduce a fourth assumption into our hypothetical universe.
866920	871560	All coordinate transformations must form a mathematical group.
871560	875760	For those of you unfamiliar with group theory, this may sound a little strange, but I promise
875760	878280	it's actually perfectly sensible.
878280	884840	In this case, all it says is that a transformation acting upon another transformation must likewise
884840	887280	be a transformation.
887280	889000	Here is how it works.
889000	893160	Suppose a third observer, whom we'll call Carl, happens to pass on by.
893160	899160	Annie therefore observes Jim, moving to the right with velocity v1, and Carl, moving along
899160	901400	with velocity v2.
901400	905880	If however, we were to transform to Jim's perspective, then he naturally observes things
905880	907400	slightly differently.
907400	913240	As expected, he sees Annie moving along with some velocity v1' and Carl moving along with
913240	916400	some different velocity, which we'll call v2'.
916400	921880	Finally, if we transform into Carl's perspective, then he naturally sees things differently
921880	925920	yet again, which we can indicate using the double-primed coordinates.
925920	932760	Carl therefore sees Annie moving along with some velocity v1' and he sees Jim moving along
932760	938000	with some other velocity, which we'll call v2'
938000	941200	Now let us impose the condition of a mathematical group.
941200	946960	A transformation from Annie to Jim, followed by yet another transformation from Jim to
946960	952440	Carl, should naturally be the same as a direct transformation from Annie to Carl.
952440	957000	We now multiply the two matrices together, yielding a new transformation which looks
957000	958720	like this.
958720	963040	This thing may look complicated at first glance, but it really isn't that bad.
963040	968400	Remember that all we care about is the simple fact that this new expression needs to obey
968400	970600	the rules of a transformation.
970600	975120	That includes all properties of transformations which we have already discovered thus far,
975120	980560	which includes the condition that the two main diagonal elements must be the same.
980560	987760	In other words, 1-f1v2' is equal to 1-f2'v1.
987760	993280	Again we do a little bit of algebra and we quickly find that v1 over f1 is equal to
993280	996880	v2' over f2'
996880	1001400	This may not look like much, but it's actually a very peculiar result.
1001560	1006760	Remember, the relative velocities between Annie, Jim, and Carl are completely arbitrary.
1006760	1010240	We're the ones in charge of this thought experiment, which means we can easily set
1010240	1012480	them to any values we like.
1012480	1017200	For example, I could hypothetically double the value of v1 while simultaneously leaving
1017200	1022360	v2' untouched and this equality still has to hold.
1022360	1027680	Yet if you look closely, the right side of this equation does not depend on v1 at all,
1027680	1031760	which means it cannot possibly change no matter what values I pick.
1031760	1033360	How can this be the case?
1033360	1038440	The only way to reconcile this contradiction is for both ratios to evaluate to some universal
1038440	1042120	constant that does not depend on either velocity.
1042120	1046560	And since we have no idea what that constant is, I'm just going to assign it another random
1046560	1049600	letter like, I don't know, a.
1049600	1057560	We therefore have v1 over f1 is equal to v2' over f2' which is equal to a.
1057560	1063800	Remember, this relationship must be true for any arbitrary coordinate transformation.
1063800	1071080	Therefore, our original transformation from Annie to Jim must likewise obey the same rule.
1071080	1078360	That little constant f must therefore evaluate to v over a for all coordinate transformations.
1078360	1082840	That leaves us with a new transformation which looks like this.
1082840	1087240	Now let's take a moment to remind ourselves of another useful fact that was already derived
1087240	1088240	earlier.
1088240	1093600	Namely, that the determinant of any transformation matrix must equal one no matter whose frame
1093600	1095800	of reference it happens to represent.
1095800	1100840	A little bit more algebra later, and we find that our mysterious Lorentz factor must evaluate
1100840	1102760	to the following.
1102760	1107280	We are therefore left with a coordinate transformation that finally looks like this.
1108040	1112120	Clearly, the only parameter we have left to make sense out of is that little mysterious
1112120	1113120	constant a.
1113120	1118080	So let's take a moment to think about what exactly that thing represents.
1118080	1123560	For starters, the astute observer might notice that a just so happens to have units of velocity
1123560	1124560	squared.
1124560	1128960	That's a little odd, but it does motivate us to rewrite a in terms of a new velocity
1128960	1135200	constant which we'll call c such that a is equal to plus or minus c squared.
1135200	1141000	Not exactly this magical velocity represents, we cannot yet say, but clearly there are only
1141000	1143480	three possible scenarios to consider.
1143480	1149160	Either a is equal to zero, thus implying c equals zero, a is positive implying that
1149160	1155440	a is equal to positive c squared, or a is negative implying that a is equal to negative
1155440	1156840	c squared.
1156840	1159880	So let's consider each of these cases one by one.
1159880	1164920	Well, clearly we can immediately reject the first option outright because all it would
1164920	1167880	do is introduce a bunch of divisions by zero.
1167880	1173280	The second option is likewise not physically viable, but the reason is not quite as obvious.
1173280	1177800	It begins by asking what would happen if Annie observes Jim traveling to the right with some
1177800	1181760	modest velocity like v is equal to c over 10.
1181760	1186800	Meanwhile, Jim observes Carl, who is likewise traveling to the right with the same relative
1186800	1188920	velocity of c over 10.
1188920	1194600	Carl, in turn, observes yet another traveler with velocity c over 10 who observes another
1194600	1197400	who observes another and so on.
1197400	1202960	Now suppose that Annie measures her heartbeat and observes a delay of exactly t equals one
1202960	1204160	second.
1204160	1208440	From Jim's perspective, he likewise observes Annie's heartbeat, and he naturally measures
1208440	1212080	some duration t prime from his frame of reference.
1212080	1217120	Carl then measures a value of t double prime and so on for every other observer down the
1217120	1218120	train.
1218120	1222400	But what exactly should we expect to happen if we simply repeated this transformation
1222400	1223960	a hundred times over?
1223960	1227200	The answer, it turns out, is a little strange.
1227200	1232000	Given enough transformations, Annie's heartbeat will actually appear to flow in the negative
1232000	1237400	direction, as in literally, the observers will eventually perceive Annie's flow of time
1237400	1239720	as moving backwards.
1239720	1244840	Well obviously, that cannot possibly be the case, so let's introduce a fifth assumption
1244840	1246640	into our universe.
1247640	1256960	For any two events, x1, t1, and x2, t2, if x2 equals x1 and t2 is greater than t1, then
1256960	1263560	all transformations must likewise result in t2 prime greater than t1 prime.
1263560	1269680	In other words, all observers must agree that time tends to move forwards for certain durations.
1269680	1274160	This condition immediately removes the second option from our list, leaving behind only
1274160	1276360	one logical possibility.
1276360	1281320	Our final transformation therefore must take on the following structure.
1281320	1287040	Finally, let us remove the matrix vector notation and write the transformation in its standard
1287040	1288280	form.
1288280	1293120	This expression has a name in physics, and it is called the Lorentz transformation.
1293120	1296520	It is also an incredible result when you think about it.
1296520	1301080	Remember that we started this thought experiment by asking a seemingly trivial question and
1301080	1302840	expecting a trivial result.
1303160	1308040	Yet of all the different mathematical possibilities we could have imagined for transforming between
1308040	1313280	inertial frames of reference, this is the only one that is consistent with our assumptions.
1313280	1317240	Besides, it's not like we demanded anything extraordinary either.
1317240	1322840	We're talking about stupidly basic assumptions like the law of inertia and the tendency for
1322840	1324880	time to move forward.
1324880	1329800	It simply cannot be any other way without the universe suddenly exploding into a bunch
1329800	1332680	of really bizarre manifestations.
1332680	1338360	Notice also how the word light was never mentioned a single time throughout this entire derivation.
1338360	1344520	If anything, the very phrase itself, the speed of light, is nothing but a blundering misnomer.
1344520	1350880	That little mystery constant C has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with photons or electromagnetic
1350880	1351880	radiation.
1351880	1357480	It's a fundamental statement about the interplay between space, time, and motion.
1357480	1361560	That's why many physicists prefer not to use the phrase speed of light.
1361560	1366040	If anything, a far more appropriate name is something like the speed of causality in
1366040	1370520	that it represents the fastest possible speed at which any single event can ever appear
1370520	1372920	to causally influence another.
1372920	1375520	But wait, I hear you asking.
1375520	1378320	Who says I can't travel faster than light?
1378320	1382720	Surely, all I have to do is hop into a spaceship and gun the engines.
1382720	1386920	Sooner or later, I have to exceed the speed of light, don't I?
1386920	1388680	But will you?
1388680	1393440	After again, that little piece of space rock floating by from Annie's perspective.
1393440	1399720	According to the law of inertia, Annie necessarily observes a velocity of dx dt equals u sub
1399720	1400720	zero.
1400720	1407600	Now ask yourself, what velocity, u sub zero prime, Jim should expect to see from his perspective?
1407600	1409760	The answer is actually perfectly straightforward.
1409760	1414840	First, we use implicit differentiation to derive the following expressions.
1415040	1419600	Next, we simply divide the one by the other to find this.
1419600	1424960	Remember that by definition, this quantity has to represent the transformed velocity
1424960	1428320	u sub zero prime from Jim's perspective.
1428320	1434240	Likewise, the quantity dx dt represents the relative velocity u sub zero between Annie
1434240	1440080	and the rock, which means we finally arrive at this expression here.
1440080	1445360	This is the famous velocity addition formula of special relativity, and you can clearly
1445360	1449960	see for yourself that velocities do not add linearly.
1449960	1455760	It seems strange and counterintuitive, but it is also the only way to preserve a well-behaved
1455760	1459840	universe that obeys our assumptions.
1459840	1464520	Consider again that long train of observers all moving past each other with some relative
1464520	1466560	velocity of c over 10.
1466560	1471400	You would think that eventually some observer will see that little piece of space rock zooming
1471400	1474760	off faster than the speed of light, but do they really?
1474760	1477920	Just try it for yourself and graph the result.
1477920	1479640	This is what you'll see.
1479640	1481040	Isn't that weird?
1481040	1486360	No matter how many times we repeat the transformation, the velocity of that little piece of space
1486360	1490400	rock will never exceed the mystery constant c.
1490400	1495960	In fact, if we let the velocity equal c itself, then all observers in all inertial frames of
1495960	1500560	reference will likewise agree that it is moving exactly that fast.
1500560	1506600	That is to say, if any observer measures an object moving with speed c, then all observers
1506600	1509200	must likewise measure a speed of c.
1509200	1514800	Again, this has to be the case because it is the only logical outcome that is consistent
1514800	1517200	with the assumptions we've made.
1517200	1522440	This is exactly why physicists are so confident in the idea of a universal speed limit.
1522800	1526560	It's not just a matter of, oh well, the evidence seems to indicate it.
1526560	1530200	It logically cannot be any other way.
1530200	1535200	Any universe that allows for objects to move beyond some universal speed limit would completely
1535200	1539400	violate our most basic presumptions about space, time, and motion.
1539400	1543760	It is therefore not a matter of hopping into a spaceship and firing the engines.
1543760	1548280	The very geometry of the universe itself doesn't allow it.
1548280	1552280	So what exactly is the value of that universal speed limit anyway?
1552280	1555960	To answer that question, you just have to start doing some basic experiments.
1555960	1565120	In our particular universe, it just so happens to be 299,792,458 meters per second.
1565120	1567000	A very large number.
1567000	1571760	So large, in fact, that we can usually approximate it as infinite and still get reliably good
1571760	1573080	results.
1573080	1578040	Letting c approach infinity thus leads us to the following transformation.
1578040	1582880	These equations are known as the Galilean transformation, and they finally represent
1582880	1587960	the simple, intuitive answer that we were originally expecting to find when we first
1587960	1589800	began this exercise.
1589800	1595120	But isn't it interesting that we practically had to trip over the correct Lorentzian transformation
1595120	1596400	just to get here?
1596400	1602480	Not to mention impose the highly dubious assumption of infinite value for that mystery constant.
1602480	1606640	It all just goes to show that you never know what you might discover if only you take the
1606640	1612720	time to enumerate a few basic assumptions and then follow the argument wherever it leads.
1612720	1613600	Thank you for watching.
