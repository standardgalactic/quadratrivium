Checking Philosophy： Engineered!/The Speed of Light has Absolutely Nothing to Do With Light.txt
1. The phrase "speed of light" is often misunderstood as referring to the speed at which light travels, but in the context of special relativity, it represents the universal upper limit on the speed at which all objects with mass can move.
   
2. According to Einstein's theory of special relativity, velocities do not add linearly. The velocity addition formula demonstrates this nonlinearity and ensures that no object can travel faster than light in any inertial frame of reference.

3. The velocity addition formula can be derived from the assumptions of Galilean relativity and the postulates of special relativity. When applying this formula, one can see that as objects approach the speed of light, their relative velocities appear to decrease when observed from another frame of reference.

4. The idea of a universal speed limit is not just based on empirical evidence but is a logical necessity of a universe consistent with the principles of special relativity. If such a thing as superluminal (faster-than-light) travel were possible, it would lead to logical inconsistencies and violate the fundamental postulates of special relativity.

5. The exact value of the speed of light in our universe is approximately 299,792,458 meters per second, which is so large that it can often be approximated as infinity for practical calculations.

6. The journey to understanding the true meaning of "speed of light" and the implications of special relativity involves carefully considering basic assumptions and following the logical implications of these principles. It illustrates how a seemingly simple concept can lead to profound insights into the nature of space, time, and motion.
