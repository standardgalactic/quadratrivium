00:00.000 --> 00:03.040
How many times has this happened to you?

00:03.040 --> 00:06.940
You're watching one of those popular science programs when suddenly you're bombarded

00:06.940 --> 00:11.880
with the outlandish claim that nothing travels faster than the speed of light.

00:11.880 --> 00:15.880
It's a common expression to be sure, and physicists love to remind us of this fact

00:15.880 --> 00:20.840
at every opportunity, but how many times have those same science educators ever stop to

00:20.840 --> 00:23.960
explain why this must be the case?

00:23.960 --> 00:28.480
It's an insanely counter-intuitive thing to say, yet most educational resources seem

00:28.480 --> 00:32.820
to just treat it as a brute fact of life, as if the universe itself is just really

00:32.820 --> 00:36.160
quirky that way, so quit your whining and get used to it.

00:36.160 --> 00:40.880
Even Einstein himself seems to just postulate it outright in his original work, and all

00:40.880 --> 00:45.640
the laws of special relativity just happen to fall out of the mathematics once you do.

00:45.640 --> 00:48.840
But what if I told you that it didn't have to be that way?

00:48.840 --> 00:53.880
The universality of the speed of light is not some quirky foible we all have to live with.

00:53.880 --> 00:57.720
Rather, it's a fundamental statement about the nature of space and time.

00:57.920 --> 01:01.840
There's even a surprisingly simple proof of this fact, and it's been well-documented

01:01.840 --> 01:04.240
in the literature for many decades.

01:04.240 --> 01:09.120
Yet for some very strange reason, it never quite made its way into our textbooks.

01:09.120 --> 01:13.080
Most popular science educators are therefore blissfully unaware of it, and they can't

01:13.080 --> 01:15.720
help but spread confusing misinformation as a result.

01:15.720 --> 01:21.120
It's a real shame, too, because the proof itself is surprisingly simple and elegant.

01:21.120 --> 01:25.280
Anyone with a basic comprehension of calculus can replicate it for themselves, which means

01:25.360 --> 01:29.560
you don't need an advanced degree to understand the argument.

01:29.560 --> 01:31.280
Here's how it works.

01:31.280 --> 01:36.200
I'd like to introduce you to the intrepid space explorer, Annie the Astronaut.

01:36.200 --> 01:40.000
At this particular moment, Annie just so happens to be soaring through the furthest

01:40.000 --> 01:44.840
reaches of outer space, far away from any massive objects like stars or planets.

01:44.840 --> 01:50.400
As part of her mission mandate, Annie must catalog her encounters with any passing objects,

01:50.400 --> 01:54.880
and she naturally accomplishes her task through the use of a very large and very sophisticated

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
meter stick.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.880
Furthermore, any time she measures the location of a passing object, she uses her on-board

02:00.880 --> 02:03.600
clock to record the time at which it occurred.

02:03.600 --> 02:10.200
The result is thus an ordered pair of numbers, x, t, which physicists refer to as an event.

02:10.200 --> 02:14.920
Now let us imagine what would happen if a second space explorer, whom we'll call Jim,

02:14.920 --> 02:17.120
just so happens to cruise on by.

02:17.120 --> 02:21.160
Just like Annie, Jim is also charged with taking his own measurements, which means he

02:21.160 --> 02:25.400
also has his own space age meter stick and on-board clock.

02:25.400 --> 02:29.480
Jim, however, is moving with some velocity v relative to Annie.

02:29.480 --> 02:34.160
Using the language of physics, we would therefore say that Jim travels in his own inertial frame

02:34.160 --> 02:35.400
of reference.

02:35.400 --> 02:40.000
Unsurprisingly, Jim therefore measures his events a little bit differently, and we can

02:40.000 --> 02:44.400
represent his perspective through the coordinates x' and t'.

02:44.400 --> 02:49.040
Finally, for the sake of personal convenience, we may further assume that Jim and Annie both

02:49.040 --> 02:53.000
agree to synchronize their instruments at the moment their origins intersect, which

02:53.000 --> 02:57.360
means they both agree to label that event as 00.

02:57.360 --> 03:02.040
Now suppose that Annie and Jim both observe an event during their encounter.

03:02.040 --> 03:06.000
Say a piece of nearby space rock happens to collide with another.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.880
Naturally, Annie performs her measurement, which she records as the numbers x, t.

03:10.880 --> 03:17.000
Likewise, Jim does the same thing from his perspective, resulting in x', t'.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.500
So far so good, right?

03:18.500 --> 03:20.980
But this raises an interesting question.

03:20.980 --> 03:26.420
Given Annie's measurement of some event, x, t, plus her velocity v relative to Jim,

03:26.420 --> 03:33.100
is it possible to calculate Jim's measurement, x', t', of the same event?

03:33.100 --> 03:38.340
This kind of calculation has a name in physics, and it is called a transformation.

03:38.340 --> 03:43.300
And at first glance, it almost comes across as a boringly trivial thing to ask, doesn't

03:43.300 --> 03:44.300
it?

03:44.300 --> 03:47.980
Yet that's exactly what makes this thought experiment so beautiful.

03:47.980 --> 03:51.980
It just feels like the result ought to be intuitively dull.

03:51.980 --> 03:56.460
But let's suppose, just for the sake of argument, that we know nothing whatsoever about the

03:56.460 --> 04:00.100
underlying nature of space, time, or motion.

04:00.100 --> 04:04.980
What minimal set of assumptions do we require in order to generate a unique solution that

04:04.980 --> 04:08.100
also jives with our everyday experience?

04:08.100 --> 04:12.420
Not many people realize it, but this simple question is the foundation of Einstein's

04:12.420 --> 04:14.500
theory of special relativity.

04:14.620 --> 04:18.620
It's such a deceptively boring question, too, that most people would never even think

04:18.620 --> 04:19.620
to ask it.

04:19.620 --> 04:23.980
At the moment we take the time to walk through it, we are immediately forced to abandon every

04:23.980 --> 04:28.140
naive intuition we ever had about the nature of space and time.

04:28.140 --> 04:32.100
So by all means, get out a pen and a piece of paper and follow along.

04:32.100 --> 04:37.100
All you need is a basic understanding of high school mathematics, and you too can see for

04:37.100 --> 04:43.820
yourself why the speed of light must be a universal constant that no one can exceed.

04:44.820 --> 04:48.340
The transformation is a function of space and time.

04:48.340 --> 04:50.100
That's not so bad, right?

04:50.100 --> 04:54.060
After all, the whole point of this thought experiment is to transform from Annie's coordinates

04:54.060 --> 04:55.140
into Jim's.

04:55.140 --> 04:59.580
It also tells us that we can ignore such factors as the temperature of the meter stick and

04:59.580 --> 05:01.820
the metallic composition of the clocks.

05:01.820 --> 05:05.780
Presumably, these sorts of things can be controlled for, so they should not have any effect on

05:05.780 --> 05:07.140
the transformation anyway.

05:07.140 --> 05:12.460
It is also conceivable that space itself exhibits some kind of weird hysteresis effect, such

05:12.460 --> 05:16.420
that there are multiple possible outcomes for any given transformation.

05:16.420 --> 05:21.060
In practice, however, none of this stuff has ever been observed, so we may reasonably assume

05:21.060 --> 05:24.020
that it won't be an issue here.

05:24.020 --> 05:25.220
Assumption number two.

05:25.220 --> 05:29.820
The laws of physics are identical in all inertial frames of reference.

05:29.820 --> 05:34.940
This is known as the principle of relativity, and it is a cornerstone of our entire understanding

05:34.940 --> 05:36.860
of motion through space and time.

05:36.860 --> 05:41.540
Basically, it tells us that there is no reason to think Annie's frame of reference is fundamentally

05:41.540 --> 05:43.020
different from Jim's.

05:43.020 --> 05:47.860
Presumably, the universe does not care that Annie is 4 feet to the left of Jim or 100

05:47.860 --> 05:49.140
miles to the right.

05:49.140 --> 05:55.060
It does not care if an event occurs at 3.32 pm versus 11.54 am, nor does it distinguish

05:55.060 --> 05:59.260
between Jim's motion to the right versus Annie's motion to the left.

05:59.260 --> 06:03.940
Both observers feel as if they're the ones at rest, while the other is the one moving.

06:03.940 --> 06:08.520
One important consequence of this assumption is that any experiment performed in one frame

06:08.520 --> 06:13.120
of reference must yield the same result when performed in the other.

06:13.120 --> 06:17.760
For example, suppose Annie holds up two magnets and measures the force between them.

06:17.760 --> 06:22.580
Then for whatever reason, Jim happens to replicate that exact same experiment in his own cockpit

06:22.580 --> 06:23.920
an hour later.

06:23.920 --> 06:28.640
All other things being equal, it seems natural to expect that Jim's result should perfectly

06:28.640 --> 06:30.160
replicate Annie's.

06:30.160 --> 06:34.160
It simply shouldn't matter that Jim is 9,000 meters away or that he's moving to Annie's

06:34.160 --> 06:38.800
left at 50 meters per second or that he's doing his experiment on a Tuesday morning.

06:38.800 --> 06:43.160
The universe does not care where you are, what time it is, or what direction you happen

06:43.160 --> 06:44.160
to be moving.

06:44.160 --> 06:48.720
The magnets should behave exactly the same in all instances.

06:48.720 --> 06:51.400
Assumption number three, the law of inertia.

06:51.400 --> 06:55.720
An object in motion shall remain in motion, and it shall travel along a straight line

06:55.720 --> 06:59.160
trajectory unless acted upon by an external force.

06:59.160 --> 07:00.320
Easy, right?

07:00.320 --> 07:04.440
Now let's see what we can deduce from these basic assumptions.

07:04.440 --> 07:10.300
To begin, imagine a piece of floating space rock that happens to move past Annie's spaceship.

07:10.300 --> 07:14.920
From her point of view, she observes the rock casually floating on by with some constant

07:14.920 --> 07:17.980
velocity in accordance with the law of inertia.

07:17.980 --> 07:22.800
For convenience, let's call this velocity u sub zero just to avoid any confusion with

07:22.800 --> 07:25.480
Jim's relative velocity v.

07:25.600 --> 07:29.920
Thus, using the language of calculus, we would say that the derivative of the rock's position

07:29.920 --> 07:34.920
x with respect to time t is equal to u sub zero.

07:34.920 --> 07:38.600
Now let's consider the same encounter from Jim's perspective.

07:38.600 --> 07:42.760
According to the law of inertia, Jim also observes the same rock moving along with some

07:42.760 --> 07:44.200
constant velocity.

07:44.200 --> 07:49.400
Jim, however, is also moving with some constant velocity v relative to Annie, which means

07:49.400 --> 07:53.160
his measurement of the rock's velocity yields a different value.

07:53.160 --> 07:57.840
Thus, we have a slightly different expression for Jim, which is written as the derivative

07:57.840 --> 08:03.400
of x prime with respect to t prime is equal to u sub zero prime.

08:03.400 --> 08:07.920
Now watch what happens when we take the derivative with respect to Annie's position.

08:07.920 --> 08:13.160
According to the law of inertia, the rock's velocity u sub zero prime is a constant throughout

08:13.160 --> 08:17.320
space and time, and so the derivative naturally evaluates to zero.

08:17.320 --> 08:21.960
If we then swap the denominators and calculate the antiderivative, we quickly find that

08:21.960 --> 08:28.040
the derivative of x prime with respect to x is some unknown constant a.

08:28.040 --> 08:30.360
This result should feel perfectly intuitive.

08:30.360 --> 08:35.640
All it says is that, given some tiny change in the rock's position from Jim's perspective,

08:35.640 --> 08:39.560
Annie observes some proportional change in position from her perspective.

08:39.560 --> 08:44.040
If we then take the ratio of these two changes, we get a constant value that does not depend

08:44.040 --> 08:45.560
on space or time.

08:45.560 --> 08:50.440
If we then repeat this argument three more times, we get three more ratios for a total

08:50.440 --> 08:53.480
of four unknown constants.

08:53.480 --> 08:57.120
Now let's take the antiderivative of the first two expressions.

08:57.120 --> 09:02.920
The first case tells us that x prime is equal to a times x plus t of t, where big t of t

09:02.920 --> 09:06.520
is just some arbitrary function of Annie's time coordinate.

09:06.520 --> 09:12.400
The second case then tells us that x prime is equal to big x of x plus b times t, where

09:12.400 --> 09:16.920
big x of x is just some other arbitrary function of Annie's spatial coordinate.

09:17.080 --> 09:21.320
If we then compare these expressions side by side, it is easy to see that there is only

09:21.320 --> 09:23.400
one possible solution.

09:23.400 --> 09:27.160
X prime is equal to a times x plus b times t.

09:27.160 --> 09:31.880
Finally, we repeat the same argument with Jim's time coordinate, t prime, and we find

09:31.880 --> 09:36.640
that t prime is equal to c times x plus d times t.

09:36.640 --> 09:40.680
Looking at these two expressions side by side, we should immediately see that the transformation

09:40.680 --> 09:45.360
from Annie's frame of reference into Jim's takes on a linear structure.

09:45.360 --> 09:50.760
That is to say, it is a linear transformation expressed by a system of linear equations.

09:50.760 --> 09:53.120
And that just feels intuitive, doesn't it?

09:53.120 --> 09:56.880
Lots of things in nature are linear, so of course it should come as no surprise that

09:56.880 --> 09:59.240
our result should take on this simple structure.

09:59.240 --> 10:02.640
And since the structure is linear, we should immediately feel inclined to express this

10:02.640 --> 10:06.160
relationship using standard matrix vector notation.

10:06.160 --> 10:11.040
That is, after all, what matrix vector algebra was specifically designed to handle.

10:11.040 --> 10:15.360
By the way, if you're not familiar with matrix vector notation, then feel free to pause now

10:15.360 --> 10:16.360
and look it up.

10:16.360 --> 10:19.840
It's important to be comfortable with this stuff as we move forward.

10:19.840 --> 10:24.040
One major advantage to this formulation is that it allows us to easily calculate the

10:24.040 --> 10:28.720
inverse transformation from Jim's frame of reference back into Annie's.

10:28.720 --> 10:34.040
This is accomplished by calculating the matrix inverse, which leads to the following expression.

10:34.040 --> 10:38.520
Note that the little delta here simply represents the determinant of the matrix, which is defined

10:38.520 --> 10:42.440
as AD minus BC for a 2 by 2 matrix.

10:42.440 --> 10:48.200
All that remains for us now is to derive the four mystery coefficients within the matrix.

10:48.200 --> 10:52.440
To that end, consider what would happen if Annie measures Jim's location.

10:52.440 --> 10:58.400
Again, by the law of inertia, she has to observe a straight line trajectory satisfying x equals

10:58.400 --> 10:59.920
v times t.

10:59.920 --> 11:05.760
By definition, however, this same location also corresponds to Jim's origin at x prime

11:05.760 --> 11:07.000
equals zero.

11:07.000 --> 11:12.080
Let us therefore substitute this information directly into the transformation for x prime,

11:12.080 --> 11:17.360
such that x prime equals zero, which is equal to AVT plus BT.

11:17.360 --> 11:22.840
A little bit of algebra later, and we now find that the constant b must satisfy b equals

11:22.840 --> 11:25.400
negative a times v.

11:25.400 --> 11:29.160
Let us further imagine the exact same situation in reverse.

11:29.160 --> 11:34.280
That is to say, Jim measures Annie's position from his perspective, which he naturally observes

11:34.280 --> 11:37.840
as x prime equals negative vt prime.

11:37.840 --> 11:42.640
In other words, he sees the exact same thing that Annie did, but in the opposite direction.

11:42.640 --> 11:48.440
Again, by definition, this corresponds to Annie's origin at x equals zero, and so the

11:48.440 --> 11:53.120
transformation from Jim's frame of reference follows a similar argument.

11:53.120 --> 12:00.040
Zero is equal to 1 over delta times the quantity of negative dvt prime minus BT prime.

12:00.040 --> 12:06.320
A little bit more algebra, and we soon find that d is equal to negative b over v, which

12:06.320 --> 12:08.200
is equal to a.

12:08.200 --> 12:12.960
In other words, the two elements along the main diagonal must be the same.

12:12.960 --> 12:17.080
The transformation from Annie's frame of reference into Jim's can therefore be written

12:17.080 --> 12:18.680
as follows.

12:18.680 --> 12:24.760
Next, suppose that Annie decides to measure some arbitrary time interval with her clock.

12:24.760 --> 12:29.720
Say the time t in seconds that it takes for her heart to beat 10 times.

12:29.720 --> 12:35.120
From Jim's perspective, this event must transform to the location x equals zero, and so it

12:35.120 --> 12:40.160
appears to last a time interval of t prime equals a times t seconds.

12:40.160 --> 12:45.560
But what exactly should we expect to happen if we perform the same experiment in reverse?

12:45.560 --> 12:50.320
That is to say, Jim measures the time it takes for his heart to beat 10 times, and he also

12:50.320 --> 12:53.320
finds that it takes exactly t seconds.

12:53.320 --> 12:58.960
Meanwhile, Annie cruises on by in her spaceship, and she observes a time interval of t equals

12:58.960 --> 13:00.800
a t over delta.

13:00.800 --> 13:05.200
According to the principle of relativity, there is no reason for Annie's frame of reference

13:05.200 --> 13:07.840
to behave any differently from Jim's.

13:07.840 --> 13:12.760
That means Annie must observe the same time interval as Jim did when the situation was

13:12.760 --> 13:13.960
reversed.

13:13.960 --> 13:18.480
In other words, Annie's measurement t is necessarily the same as Jim's measurement

13:18.480 --> 13:19.720
t prime.

13:19.720 --> 13:25.360
This forces us to conclude a t equals a t over delta, from which it immediately follows

13:25.360 --> 13:28.480
that the determinant delta equals one.

13:28.480 --> 13:32.920
The inverse transformation from Jim's frame of reference back into Annie's can therefore

13:32.920 --> 13:35.440
be written like this.

13:35.440 --> 13:39.800
At this point, it helps to do a little bit of rearrangement on the transformation.

13:39.800 --> 13:44.000
Note that this is not imposing any assumptions, but simply cleaning up the expression so

13:44.000 --> 13:47.040
that it better matches our modern conventions.

13:47.040 --> 13:51.240
To begin, let's factor out the coefficient a, and then rename it to the Greek letter

13:51.240 --> 13:52.520
gamma.

13:52.520 --> 13:57.640
This little guy is called the Lorentz factor, and it is easily the most important parameter

13:57.640 --> 13:59.320
in all of relativity.

13:59.320 --> 14:04.800
In doing so, however, we also encounter another little factor of c divided by a.

14:04.800 --> 14:09.560
And since this is just some constant number divided by yet another constant number, it

14:09.560 --> 14:13.040
is likewise nothing more than some arbitrary constant number.

14:13.040 --> 14:17.040
Thus, for lack of anything better to call it, let us simply replace it with the letter

14:17.040 --> 14:18.040
f.

14:18.040 --> 14:21.920
Our updated transformation now looks like this.

14:21.920 --> 14:26.920
We are now ready to introduce a fourth assumption into our hypothetical universe.

14:26.920 --> 14:31.560
All coordinate transformations must form a mathematical group.

14:31.560 --> 14:35.760
For those of you unfamiliar with group theory, this may sound a little strange, but I promise

14:35.760 --> 14:38.280
it's actually perfectly sensible.

14:38.280 --> 14:44.840
In this case, all it says is that a transformation acting upon another transformation must likewise

14:44.840 --> 14:47.280
be a transformation.

14:47.280 --> 14:49.000
Here is how it works.

14:49.000 --> 14:53.160
Suppose a third observer, whom we'll call Carl, happens to pass on by.

14:53.160 --> 14:59.160
Annie therefore observes Jim, moving to the right with velocity v1, and Carl, moving along

14:59.160 --> 15:01.400
with velocity v2.

15:01.400 --> 15:05.880
If however, we were to transform to Jim's perspective, then he naturally observes things

15:05.880 --> 15:07.400
slightly differently.

15:07.400 --> 15:13.240
As expected, he sees Annie moving along with some velocity v1' and Carl moving along with

15:13.240 --> 15:16.400
some different velocity, which we'll call v2'.

15:16.400 --> 15:21.880
Finally, if we transform into Carl's perspective, then he naturally sees things differently

15:21.880 --> 15:25.920
yet again, which we can indicate using the double-primed coordinates.

15:25.920 --> 15:32.760
Carl therefore sees Annie moving along with some velocity v1' and he sees Jim moving along

15:32.760 --> 15:38.000
with some other velocity, which we'll call v2'

15:38.000 --> 15:41.200
Now let us impose the condition of a mathematical group.

15:41.200 --> 15:46.960
A transformation from Annie to Jim, followed by yet another transformation from Jim to

15:46.960 --> 15:52.440
Carl, should naturally be the same as a direct transformation from Annie to Carl.

15:52.440 --> 15:57.000
We now multiply the two matrices together, yielding a new transformation which looks

15:57.000 --> 15:58.720
like this.

15:58.720 --> 16:03.040
This thing may look complicated at first glance, but it really isn't that bad.

16:03.040 --> 16:08.400
Remember that all we care about is the simple fact that this new expression needs to obey

16:08.400 --> 16:10.600
the rules of a transformation.

16:10.600 --> 16:15.120
That includes all properties of transformations which we have already discovered thus far,

16:15.120 --> 16:20.560
which includes the condition that the two main diagonal elements must be the same.

16:20.560 --> 16:27.760
In other words, 1-f1v2' is equal to 1-f2'v1.

16:27.760 --> 16:33.280
Again we do a little bit of algebra and we quickly find that v1 over f1 is equal to

16:33.280 --> 16:36.880
v2' over f2'

16:36.880 --> 16:41.400
This may not look like much, but it's actually a very peculiar result.

16:41.560 --> 16:46.760
Remember, the relative velocities between Annie, Jim, and Carl are completely arbitrary.

16:46.760 --> 16:50.240
We're the ones in charge of this thought experiment, which means we can easily set

16:50.240 --> 16:52.480
them to any values we like.

16:52.480 --> 16:57.200
For example, I could hypothetically double the value of v1 while simultaneously leaving

16:57.200 --> 17:02.360
v2' untouched and this equality still has to hold.

17:02.360 --> 17:07.680
Yet if you look closely, the right side of this equation does not depend on v1 at all,

17:07.680 --> 17:11.760
which means it cannot possibly change no matter what values I pick.

17:11.760 --> 17:13.360
How can this be the case?

17:13.360 --> 17:18.440
The only way to reconcile this contradiction is for both ratios to evaluate to some universal

17:18.440 --> 17:22.120
constant that does not depend on either velocity.

17:22.120 --> 17:26.560
And since we have no idea what that constant is, I'm just going to assign it another random

17:26.560 --> 17:29.600
letter like, I don't know, a.

17:29.600 --> 17:37.560
We therefore have v1 over f1 is equal to v2' over f2' which is equal to a.

17:37.560 --> 17:43.800
Remember, this relationship must be true for any arbitrary coordinate transformation.

17:43.800 --> 17:51.080
Therefore, our original transformation from Annie to Jim must likewise obey the same rule.

17:51.080 --> 17:58.360
That little constant f must therefore evaluate to v over a for all coordinate transformations.

17:58.360 --> 18:02.840
That leaves us with a new transformation which looks like this.

18:02.840 --> 18:07.240
Now let's take a moment to remind ourselves of another useful fact that was already derived

18:07.240 --> 18:08.240
earlier.

18:08.240 --> 18:13.600
Namely, that the determinant of any transformation matrix must equal one no matter whose frame

18:13.600 --> 18:15.800
of reference it happens to represent.

18:15.800 --> 18:20.840
A little bit more algebra later, and we find that our mysterious Lorentz factor must evaluate

18:20.840 --> 18:22.760
to the following.

18:22.760 --> 18:27.280
We are therefore left with a coordinate transformation that finally looks like this.

18:28.040 --> 18:32.120
Clearly, the only parameter we have left to make sense out of is that little mysterious

18:32.120 --> 18:33.120
constant a.

18:33.120 --> 18:38.080
So let's take a moment to think about what exactly that thing represents.

18:38.080 --> 18:43.560
For starters, the astute observer might notice that a just so happens to have units of velocity

18:43.560 --> 18:44.560
squared.

18:44.560 --> 18:48.960
That's a little odd, but it does motivate us to rewrite a in terms of a new velocity

18:48.960 --> 18:55.200
constant which we'll call c such that a is equal to plus or minus c squared.

18:55.200 --> 19:01.000
Not exactly this magical velocity represents, we cannot yet say, but clearly there are only

19:01.000 --> 19:03.480
three possible scenarios to consider.

19:03.480 --> 19:09.160
Either a is equal to zero, thus implying c equals zero, a is positive implying that

19:09.160 --> 19:15.440
a is equal to positive c squared, or a is negative implying that a is equal to negative

19:15.440 --> 19:16.840
c squared.

19:16.840 --> 19:19.880
So let's consider each of these cases one by one.

19:19.880 --> 19:24.920
Well, clearly we can immediately reject the first option outright because all it would

19:24.920 --> 19:27.880
do is introduce a bunch of divisions by zero.

19:27.880 --> 19:33.280
The second option is likewise not physically viable, but the reason is not quite as obvious.

19:33.280 --> 19:37.800
It begins by asking what would happen if Annie observes Jim traveling to the right with some

19:37.800 --> 19:41.760
modest velocity like v is equal to c over 10.

19:41.760 --> 19:46.800
Meanwhile, Jim observes Carl, who is likewise traveling to the right with the same relative

19:46.800 --> 19:48.920
velocity of c over 10.

19:48.920 --> 19:54.600
Carl, in turn, observes yet another traveler with velocity c over 10 who observes another

19:54.600 --> 19:57.400
who observes another and so on.

19:57.400 --> 20:02.960
Now suppose that Annie measures her heartbeat and observes a delay of exactly t equals one

20:02.960 --> 20:04.160
second.

20:04.160 --> 20:08.440
From Jim's perspective, he likewise observes Annie's heartbeat, and he naturally measures

20:08.440 --> 20:12.080
some duration t prime from his frame of reference.

20:12.080 --> 20:17.120
Carl then measures a value of t double prime and so on for every other observer down the

20:17.120 --> 20:18.120
train.

20:18.120 --> 20:22.400
But what exactly should we expect to happen if we simply repeated this transformation

20:22.400 --> 20:23.960
a hundred times over?

20:23.960 --> 20:27.200
The answer, it turns out, is a little strange.

20:27.200 --> 20:32.000
Given enough transformations, Annie's heartbeat will actually appear to flow in the negative

20:32.000 --> 20:37.400
direction, as in literally, the observers will eventually perceive Annie's flow of time

20:37.400 --> 20:39.720
as moving backwards.

20:39.720 --> 20:44.840
Well obviously, that cannot possibly be the case, so let's introduce a fifth assumption

20:44.840 --> 20:46.640
into our universe.

20:47.640 --> 20:56.960
For any two events, x1, t1, and x2, t2, if x2 equals x1 and t2 is greater than t1, then

20:56.960 --> 21:03.560
all transformations must likewise result in t2 prime greater than t1 prime.

21:03.560 --> 21:09.680
In other words, all observers must agree that time tends to move forwards for certain durations.

21:09.680 --> 21:14.160
This condition immediately removes the second option from our list, leaving behind only

21:14.160 --> 21:16.360
one logical possibility.

21:16.360 --> 21:21.320
Our final transformation therefore must take on the following structure.

21:21.320 --> 21:27.040
Finally, let us remove the matrix vector notation and write the transformation in its standard

21:27.040 --> 21:28.280
form.

21:28.280 --> 21:33.120
This expression has a name in physics, and it is called the Lorentz transformation.

21:33.120 --> 21:36.520
It is also an incredible result when you think about it.

21:36.520 --> 21:41.080
Remember that we started this thought experiment by asking a seemingly trivial question and

21:41.080 --> 21:42.840
expecting a trivial result.

21:43.160 --> 21:48.040
Yet of all the different mathematical possibilities we could have imagined for transforming between

21:48.040 --> 21:53.280
inertial frames of reference, this is the only one that is consistent with our assumptions.

21:53.280 --> 21:57.240
Besides, it's not like we demanded anything extraordinary either.

21:57.240 --> 22:02.840
We're talking about stupidly basic assumptions like the law of inertia and the tendency for

22:02.840 --> 22:04.880
time to move forward.

22:04.880 --> 22:09.800
It simply cannot be any other way without the universe suddenly exploding into a bunch

22:09.800 --> 22:12.680
of really bizarre manifestations.

22:12.680 --> 22:18.360
Notice also how the word light was never mentioned a single time throughout this entire derivation.

22:18.360 --> 22:24.520
If anything, the very phrase itself, the speed of light, is nothing but a blundering misnomer.

22:24.520 --> 22:30.880
That little mystery constant C has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with photons or electromagnetic

22:30.880 --> 22:31.880
radiation.

22:31.880 --> 22:37.480
It's a fundamental statement about the interplay between space, time, and motion.

22:37.480 --> 22:41.560
That's why many physicists prefer not to use the phrase speed of light.

22:41.560 --> 22:46.040
If anything, a far more appropriate name is something like the speed of causality in

22:46.040 --> 22:50.520
that it represents the fastest possible speed at which any single event can ever appear

22:50.520 --> 22:52.920
to causally influence another.

22:52.920 --> 22:55.520
But wait, I hear you asking.

22:55.520 --> 22:58.320
Who says I can't travel faster than light?

22:58.320 --> 23:02.720
Surely, all I have to do is hop into a spaceship and gun the engines.

23:02.720 --> 23:06.920
Sooner or later, I have to exceed the speed of light, don't I?

23:06.920 --> 23:08.680
But will you?

23:08.680 --> 23:13.440
After again, that little piece of space rock floating by from Annie's perspective.

23:13.440 --> 23:19.720
According to the law of inertia, Annie necessarily observes a velocity of dx dt equals u sub

23:19.720 --> 23:20.720
zero.

23:20.720 --> 23:27.600
Now ask yourself, what velocity, u sub zero prime, Jim should expect to see from his perspective?

23:27.600 --> 23:29.760
The answer is actually perfectly straightforward.

23:29.760 --> 23:34.840
First, we use implicit differentiation to derive the following expressions.

23:35.040 --> 23:39.600
Next, we simply divide the one by the other to find this.

23:39.600 --> 23:44.960
Remember that by definition, this quantity has to represent the transformed velocity

23:44.960 --> 23:48.320
u sub zero prime from Jim's perspective.

23:48.320 --> 23:54.240
Likewise, the quantity dx dt represents the relative velocity u sub zero between Annie

23:54.240 --> 24:00.080
and the rock, which means we finally arrive at this expression here.

24:00.080 --> 24:05.360
This is the famous velocity addition formula of special relativity, and you can clearly

24:05.360 --> 24:09.960
see for yourself that velocities do not add linearly.

24:09.960 --> 24:15.760
It seems strange and counterintuitive, but it is also the only way to preserve a well-behaved

24:15.760 --> 24:19.840
universe that obeys our assumptions.

24:19.840 --> 24:24.520
Consider again that long train of observers all moving past each other with some relative

24:24.520 --> 24:26.560
velocity of c over 10.

24:26.560 --> 24:31.400
You would think that eventually some observer will see that little piece of space rock zooming

24:31.400 --> 24:34.760
off faster than the speed of light, but do they really?

24:34.760 --> 24:37.920
Just try it for yourself and graph the result.

24:37.920 --> 24:39.640
This is what you'll see.

24:39.640 --> 24:41.040
Isn't that weird?

24:41.040 --> 24:46.360
No matter how many times we repeat the transformation, the velocity of that little piece of space

24:46.360 --> 24:50.400
rock will never exceed the mystery constant c.

24:50.400 --> 24:55.960
In fact, if we let the velocity equal c itself, then all observers in all inertial frames of

24:55.960 --> 25:00.560
reference will likewise agree that it is moving exactly that fast.

25:00.560 --> 25:06.600
That is to say, if any observer measures an object moving with speed c, then all observers

25:06.600 --> 25:09.200
must likewise measure a speed of c.

25:09.200 --> 25:14.800
Again, this has to be the case because it is the only logical outcome that is consistent

25:14.800 --> 25:17.200
with the assumptions we've made.

25:17.200 --> 25:22.440
This is exactly why physicists are so confident in the idea of a universal speed limit.

25:22.800 --> 25:26.560
It's not just a matter of, oh well, the evidence seems to indicate it.

25:26.560 --> 25:30.200
It logically cannot be any other way.

25:30.200 --> 25:35.200
Any universe that allows for objects to move beyond some universal speed limit would completely

25:35.200 --> 25:39.400
violate our most basic presumptions about space, time, and motion.

25:39.400 --> 25:43.760
It is therefore not a matter of hopping into a spaceship and firing the engines.

25:43.760 --> 25:48.280
The very geometry of the universe itself doesn't allow it.

25:48.280 --> 25:52.280
So what exactly is the value of that universal speed limit anyway?

25:52.280 --> 25:55.960
To answer that question, you just have to start doing some basic experiments.

25:55.960 --> 26:05.120
In our particular universe, it just so happens to be 299,792,458 meters per second.

26:05.120 --> 26:07.000
A very large number.

26:07.000 --> 26:11.760
So large, in fact, that we can usually approximate it as infinite and still get reliably good

26:11.760 --> 26:13.080
results.

26:13.080 --> 26:18.040
Letting c approach infinity thus leads us to the following transformation.

26:18.040 --> 26:22.880
These equations are known as the Galilean transformation, and they finally represent

26:22.880 --> 26:27.960
the simple, intuitive answer that we were originally expecting to find when we first

26:27.960 --> 26:29.800
began this exercise.

26:29.800 --> 26:35.120
But isn't it interesting that we practically had to trip over the correct Lorentzian transformation

26:35.120 --> 26:36.400
just to get here?

26:36.400 --> 26:42.480
Not to mention impose the highly dubious assumption of infinite value for that mystery constant.

26:42.480 --> 26:46.640
It all just goes to show that you never know what you might discover if only you take the

26:46.640 --> 26:52.720
time to enumerate a few basic assumptions and then follow the argument wherever it leads.

26:52.720 --> 26:53.600
Thank you for watching.
