00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
What does the word meaning denote in the expression meaning of life?

00:11.000 --> 00:17.000
Is it a directive, a feeling, or something else entirely?

00:17.000 --> 00:24.000
Well, I think it's not a straightforward manner to discuss the meaning of life, right?

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
Because it's pretty clear that there are multiple meanings,

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
and those meanings are associated with different events and situations.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
I think you can still intelligently address the issue of the meaning of life,

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
because meanings tend to arrange themselves into a hierarchy of value and relevance,

00:41.000 --> 00:48.000
and they have to do that because otherwise there's nothing but, as William James suggested,

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
sort of a blooming and buzzing confusion.

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
So the issue is multiple meanings in a unified, integrated framework.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
Meaning is partly an impetus for action.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
It's very important to remember that human beings are active and living creatures,

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
and that one of our primary problems, in fact, perhaps our primary problem,

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
is how to act in the world.

01:12.000 --> 01:18.000
But that also involves other questions like how to perceive, how to prepare for action,

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
how to plan for action in the future.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
And so all of those questions are associated with meaning.

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000
For me, meaning is the abstract impetus towards action, fundamentally.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
And it's an important thing to give some consideration to,

01:33.000 --> 01:40.000
because part of the Western intellectual tradition tends to abstract rationality

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
or consciousness from embodiment, and it's very much the case that we are embodied creatures.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
The idea that our brain is in our head and that our mind is in our brain,

01:49.000 --> 01:57.000
it's a useful idea for certain purposes, but it obscures much while shedding light on other things.

01:57.000 --> 02:03.000
So meaning is tightly associated with action, with the abstraction of action,

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
but then also with the construction of the perceptual frameworks and emotional responses

02:07.000 --> 02:14.000
that are necessary to conceive of the world in a manner that allows you to act in it.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
So one of the things we know, for example, is that when you walk into a room like this

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
and you see the furniture of the landscape arrayed in front of you,

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
that one of the things that you directly perceive is actually the meaning of that furniture.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
And you might think that you see the object and infer the meaning,

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
and that's what you would think if you were a traditional Western rationalist or even a materialist,

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
but it actually seems to be the case that when you walk into a room like this,

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
the room tells you what to do at a level that's below conscious realization,

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
and it's partly because, well, you know exactly what chairs are for.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
You might ask yourself, for example, what is a chair?

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
It's a complicated question because it could be a beanbag and it could be a stump,

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
but fundamentally a chair is something to sit in,

02:58.000 --> 03:04.000
and when you see a chair, the chair tells you directly as a perceptual consequence that you sit in it,

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
and that's the meaning of the chair.

03:06.000 --> 03:13.000
And so you can't understand meaning in that manner without considering meaning in relationship to embodiment.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
And so meaning is really how we propel ourselves through the world

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
and how we organize ourselves and arrange to propel ourselves through the world

03:21.000 --> 03:28.000
in a manner that's productive, relatively free of suffering, even though that's a meaning,

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
and sustainable across many situations and contexts.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
So that's a rough framework for the initiation of the discussion.

03:39.000 --> 03:44.000
For me, I think the first thing I would say is that word meaning is being used as a metaphor.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.000
We're taking basically a term from language, a sentence is meaningful,

03:50.000 --> 03:57.000
and we're using it metaphorically to try to denote something that is probably pre-linguistic,

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
although it shows up in our language.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
A sentence is meaningful in that it does something to information

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
in such a way that we get a fundamental connection between ourselves and the world.

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
And I think that's, for me, what is fundamentally going on when we talk about meaning.

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
We're talking about the fact that there's a fundamental process of selection

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
that the brain, the embodied brain, which I agree with you is a very important thing

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
to constantly remind ourselves of, has to face.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
There's way too much information available at all times,

04:29.000 --> 04:36.000
and of all of that information, only some of it is going to be useful or helpful to an organism.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
And somehow that information has to be found.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
It has to be found in a very reliable manner.

04:42.000 --> 04:49.000
It has to be transformed into a form that is relevant to this body in this world,

04:49.000 --> 04:57.000
such that I can frame problems, solve problems, achieve my goals.

04:57.000 --> 05:03.000
And that process of zeroing in on relevant information, what I call relevance realization,

05:03.000 --> 05:11.000
means that we are fundamentally thrown into a atmospheric kind of relationship to the world.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
There's a salience landscape constantly being projected at all times of how things stand out to you,

05:16.000 --> 05:22.000
what gathers your attention, what arouses your metabolic resources or dampens them,

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
what creates certain motivational and affective states.

05:26.000 --> 05:32.000
Because this relevance realization process is not a cold calculation, like a computer.

05:32.000 --> 05:37.000
It's instead a deep involvement between the organism and its world.

05:37.000 --> 05:44.000
And that involvement has, as Jordan says, it's often and most prominently going on below consciousness,

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
and it's an ongoing, evolving process.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
I mean, one minute something is salient.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
Look, that became salient to you, now it's not salient anymore.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
So that process is constantly evolving.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
And so we shouldn't think of meaning as a static thing,

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
but this ongoing process by which the organism is constantly fitting itself to the world

06:02.000 --> 06:08.000
and having the world fitted to it so that its actions can be undertaken in a fluent manner.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
Now the thing that I think is very important about this,

06:12.000 --> 06:17.000
meaning making process, or as I prefer to call it, relevance realization,

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
because I think meaning is standing in as a metaphor for that,

06:20.000 --> 06:27.000
is that this process is, it's below our consciousness, it's below our rationality,

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
it's below our language use, it's below our deliberative reasoning,

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
precisely because it's constitutive or presupposed by all those processes.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
Until you do relevance realization, you can't use a language.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
Until you do relevance realization, you can't form representations.

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
Until you do relevance realization, you can't even form your own autobiographical identity.

06:46.000 --> 06:53.000
The world as a place that has categories and you as a cognitive agent with a sense of identity in it,

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
both co-spring from this relevance realization.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
It is a deep binding of you and the world at a fundamental level.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
And that's why when it's threatened in any fashion,

07:03.000 --> 07:09.000
human beings will experience a deep kind of trauma, absurdity, horror, a deep kind of anxiety.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
And so when I think people are talking about meaning in life,

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
what they're trying to gesture towards is they have structures in place

07:15.000 --> 07:21.000
that maintain and enhance that relevance realization such that two things are possible.

07:21.000 --> 07:26.000
They can reliably keep at bay absurdity and horror,

07:26.000 --> 07:32.000
and they can reliably afford the ongoing evolution, the growth of that relevance realization

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
so that they can find some kind of fulfillment in that identity

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
that they are cultivating for themselves as a cognitive agent

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
and the world into which they are fitted.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
And so I think the degree to which people are talking about meaning in life

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
is the degree to which they're talking about those kinds of structures

07:49.000 --> 07:55.000
that affect that co-creation out of relevance realization of cognitive agency

07:55.000 --> 08:00.000
and a world in which cognitive agents can solve problems in an intelligible manner.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
We should also maybe decide if we agree on something.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
We're going to agree on many things, I suppose.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
And a lot of a discussion like this is often terminological

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
and it's partly going to be the case between John and I

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
because his intellectual background is different than mine,

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
although it overlaps in some important ways.

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
And so partly what I'm hoping to do with the discussion tonight

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
is to make sure that we actually understand each other.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
This is definitely not a debate in which one of us is going to win.

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
What we're hoping to do is to have the kind of conversation

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
that allows for the scaffolding and the further development of ideas,

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
which is really what an intellectual conversation is.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
So I want to offer you a couple of propositions

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
and tell me what you think about them.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
The first thing is that I don't believe that the question

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
does life have meaning is actually a reasonable question.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
I don't think it's properly formulated.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
And the reason I believe that is because

08:54.000 --> 08:59.000
that isn't really what people want to know when they ask that question.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Life has lots of meanings.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
The Buddhists would say that life is suffering.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
And you know, we might not think about suffering as meaning,

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
but fundamentally it's anxiety and pain

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
and with some disgust thrown in there maybe for good measure.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
And those are meanings.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
And even if you're nihilistic and you're not oriented towards

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
a belief in some sort of ultimate meaning structure,

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
that doesn't mean you can escape from the meaning of life.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
What it does mean is that the meaning of your life is misery,

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
suffering, anxiety, and a real decrement and quality.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
So we're trapped inside the question of the meaning of life.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
There's no getting outside of it.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
You can say there's no ultimate meaning,

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
but then you have to define ultimate.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
And then the other thing that I thought...

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
So let me just make sure I got the first proposition.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
The first proposition is the question,

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
I want to make sure I got your wording right,

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
does life have a meaning as opposed?

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
I just want to store that.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
I can either respond or wait until you put your second question out.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
Yeah, yeah.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
I just don't want to lose the first question.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
The other thing that might be useful, clarifying,

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
I understand what you mean by relevance realization.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
I have a formulation of it in my own language,

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
so I'm going to make a couple of comments on that as well,

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
and you can tell me if you agree or disagree on that.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
So one of the things that's quite...

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
One of the ways that you can approach the idea of meaning

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
is by making a separate assumption

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
about what the fundamental structures in the world are.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
I mean, materialists and empiricists

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
tend to believe that the fundamental structures are,

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
we'll say, atomic particles,

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
even though we know we can go higher resolution than that.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
There's atomic particles and there's this space

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
in which they're distributed,

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
and what that means is that the combination of quantum particles,

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
quantized particles plus space,

10:44.000 --> 10:49.000
allows for the array of physical entities in patterns.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Like music is a pattern,

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
and there seems to me that there's something profoundly similar

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
about patterns and information,

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
and it seems to me that what we experience as meaning

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
is something like our interaction with information.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
Now, I just want to say one more thing about that.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
The problem with information in some sense

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
is that there's too much of it.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
So one of the things you could say about life's meaning

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
is that there's absolutely way too much of it.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
You can certainly experience that

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
if you ever have an experience of awe,

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
or even of overwhelming absurdity.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
Those are both quasi-religious experiences.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
So relevance realization is actually, as far as I can tell,

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
it's the limitation of what's essentially

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
an close to infinite field of information

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
that's so rich that it can't be exhausted

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
into a narrower form that's focal and useful

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
for this particular time and this particular place

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
for this particular set of activities.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
So it's a narrowing process.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
Yeah, okay, so I'll respond to the second thing first

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
because that will actually help me to respond

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
to your first question about the posing of the question.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Yeah, I think that's a good way of putting it.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Although I would want to emphasize

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
that I don't think that process is just a selection process,

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
it's an important transformation process

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
because we do something to the information,

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
and you made reference to this in the embodiment.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
It's not just that we have sort of passively taken in the information

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
or selected it from the environment.

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
We make the pieces, like you said, we find patterns.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
It's how the pieces are relevant to each other,

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
how they're relevant to us.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Again, and I'm trying to emphasize this,

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
not just as some sort of cold calculation

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
about that information, but a way in which...

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
I mean, we say it like we make sense.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
It's constitutive of our cognitive agency.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
Just like our bodies take in matter,

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
but they don't just select the matter,

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
they transform it and restructure it,

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
so we have the ability to operate in the world.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Our minds don't just select the information,

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
they take in it, they transform it and structure it,

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
so analogous to our bodies,

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
we gain skills and abilities to interact with that world

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
from which that information was selected.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
That's why I think people love to watch bands improvise,

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
because really what they're doing,

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
especially if they're doing it collectively,

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
is they're engaging in a collective process

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
of the spontaneous transmutation of patterns.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
And I think the reason that people find that so deeply meaningful

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
is because it is representation,

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
like an ongoing abstract artistic representation.

13:20.000 --> 13:24.000
I think it's an exemplification of what we do in the world.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
That's right. I think one of the reasons why we like art

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
is we play with the variance...

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
We're playing in the Piagetian sense of playing,

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
in the sense of developing our skills.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
We play with the relevance realization machinery for its own sake.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
But that allows me to go back to your...

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
I think asking for the meaning of life,

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
it carries with it sort of...

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
even saying the meaning in life,

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
it carries with it the presupposition that meaning is sort of there to be found,

13:50.000 --> 13:55.000
and it immediately steers us away from this ongoing process

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
in which we're taking in information,

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
transforming it, structuring it,

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
altering ourselves, fitting to a world

14:02.000 --> 14:06.000
that is then also itself, restructuring itself, changing itself.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
And so there's this ongoing, evolving relationship.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
So one of the reasons why I don't like the question,

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
the meaning of life, is it proposes a ready-made answer to be found.

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
It presupposes a static thing to be discovered,

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
or even a static relation to be realized.

14:22.000 --> 14:27.000
And it also carries with it the idea that...

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
It's like, like you said,

14:30.000 --> 14:35.000
it's like there is an answer to a question that has been posed,

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
when I don't think the issue facing us is a riddle

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
or a question in that sense that some proposition will satisfy.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
I don't think there's anything that...

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
I'm sorry, this will sound incredibly pretentious,

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
but I'm being asked about, I think.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
I don't think there's anything...

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
I'm trying to make him sound pretentious.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
I don't think there's a proposition that anybody can say to you

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
that will render your life meaningful.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
I mean, you might do things with that proposition

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
that might fit you better to the world

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
so that horror becomes less prevalent

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
and flourishing becomes more prominent.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
But to think that the answer is in the proposition

15:11.000 --> 15:16.000
is to misunderstand the role of propositions in our cognition.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
The propositional level is very high up

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
and sits on many recursive levels of relevance realization

15:22.000 --> 15:27.000
that only at their very tip produce this kind of propositional processing.

15:27.000 --> 15:32.000
The meaning is much more our knowing how to interact with the world,

15:32.000 --> 15:37.000
knowing how to fit my hand to this glass is part of that process.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
And that's not based on sort of just...

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
It's not primarily based on my beliefs about the glass.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
It's based on a much more complex dynamical system

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
by which my body, my perception, the glass, the atmosphere

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
are fitting together so that I can grasp the glass.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
So one of the things that I found interesting,

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
I learned this, I think, mostly from Gibson,

15:59.000 --> 16:04.000
who wrote a book called...

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
One of the things Gibson presupposes,

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
he has a very interesting way of looking at the world

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
and it's tied deeply into our fundamental presuppositions

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
about the structure of reality

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
because one of the big issues about meaning in some sense

16:20.000 --> 16:25.000
is whether it's fundamentally constitutive of reality

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
or if it's what would you call an emergent property

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
of something more fundamental.

16:29.000 --> 16:34.000
Now the answer to that question in part is exactly what do you mean by reality

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
and also the question is also what do you mean by truth

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
and this isn't Pontius Pilate's question,

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
it's a whole different kind of question.

16:42.000 --> 16:47.000
Now the modern neuroscientists in some sense following Gibson

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
make the claim that when you look at a glass like that

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
that what happens in your brain is that the pattern of the glass

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
maps itself onto the pattern of your gripping hand

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
and that maps itself onto the pattern of pouring and drinking

17:00.000 --> 17:05.000
and that a lot of that happens potentially before or alongside

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
your conscious perception of the glass as an object.

17:09.000 --> 17:13.000
So we know for example that there are people who claim to be blind

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
who can still map objects onto their body.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
So that's called blind sight.

17:18.000 --> 17:23.000
So developing that idea, it's appeared to me

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
that there's good evidence that what we see when we look at the world is meaning.

17:27.000 --> 17:32.000
We don't see objects and infer meaning, we see meaning and we infer objects

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
and so then the question is well is the meaning real

17:35.000 --> 17:39.000
and then that answer to that is well what do you mean by real

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
and it'll only take me a minute to lay this out.

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
This starts to depend on whether you're a Darwinian or a Newtonian.

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
If you're a Newtonian then the real thing is the material object

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
and we also know that Newton in some important ways was wrong

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
but if you're a Darwinian and you almost have to be a Darwinian

17:58.000 --> 18:03.000
I really don't see any escape from it unless you don't know what you're talking about fundamentally.

18:03.000 --> 18:12.000
There's reasons for that is that the thing that determines whether or not

18:12.000 --> 18:18.000
you're going to survive and propagate which is by the way the best solution

18:18.000 --> 18:22.000
you can possibly answer to the problem of life if you're a biological organism

18:22.000 --> 18:27.000
and you have a Darwinian philosophy, the question you're trying to answer is

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
what is the appropriate meaning to perceive in each environment

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
because that determines your action and your action

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
the consequences of your action determines whether you survive and propagate

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
and so if you take the question of meaning from a Darwinian perspective

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
you can actually say as far as I can tell that the fundamental constituent elements

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
at least of experience and perhaps of reality itself

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
are the meanings that you perceive before you infer the object.

18:52.000 --> 18:57.000
Now that's a pretty radical ontological claim and I've never heard anyone else actually make it

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
except for maybe the pragmatists.

18:59.000 --> 19:04.000
It's a variant of pragmatic philosophy but I've tried to wrap my head around that argument

19:04.000 --> 19:09.000
and see if I can destroy it but I can't so I'm just wondering what you think about that.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
I have a lot to think about that and I have a lot to say about it.

19:12.000 --> 19:18.000
First of all, before I get into the Darwinian Newtonian thing

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
which I've seen you do a couple of times before and I've always found it very interesting.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
It's one of my little tricks.

19:23.000 --> 19:27.000
You belittle it, it's one of your good tricks. I mean it's a very good one.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
It's a very good point.

19:29.000 --> 19:34.000
First of all the question, I do think that fittedness to the world does create

19:34.000 --> 19:41.000
I think Plato had a fantastic insight that above and beyond any particular desire we have

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
we have a desire for what we desire to be real in some sense.

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
One of the ways to rob meaning from your life is to suddenly realize

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
that a bunch of things, a bunch of the things you've desired

19:51.000 --> 19:55.000
or the bunch of the things that you thought made you happy are illusory in some sense.

19:55.000 --> 19:59.000
In fact people will do a bizarre thing and I do this every time in a class.

19:59.000 --> 20:05.000
I'll ask how many of you are in really satisfying, deeply satisfying personal relationships

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
and surprisingly many people put up their hands.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
Those are the self-deceptive ones.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
And then I do the following.

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
I say how many of you would want to know if your partner was cheating on you

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
such that it would destroy the relationship

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
and almost all of them put their hands back up again.

20:29.000 --> 20:36.000
They would rather have the truth than have all of that other stuff that they find so good be illusory.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
And I think that was one of Plato's profound insights.

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
This connectedness to reality is a fundamental drive in us.

20:43.000 --> 20:47.000
You know John, when you're asking that you're basically asking people whether or not

20:47.000 --> 20:51.000
if they were in a perfect garden they'd be willing to check out the snake.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
Yes, right.

20:52.000 --> 20:56.000
And the answer of course we all know is that well of course people will check out the snake

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
because that's just what we're like.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
But I do think there's something important to that.

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
I think ultimately the platonic orientation towards truth

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
is grounded in that notion of a deeper drive towards real.

21:07.000 --> 21:12.000
I think asking the question about whether or not meaning is real

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
part of it I want to challenge the presupposition behind the question first

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
because the presupposition behind that is that only things are real

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
and that relationships, relations between things aren't real.

21:23.000 --> 21:28.000
And I think it is very, so it might strike people as odd for me to say

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
yes of course I think relevance is real

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
I don't think it's part, and this is where I might differ with you

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
but I think we'll have to negotiate it.

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
I don't think it's part of the physical fabric of the universe

21:39.000 --> 21:43.000
nor do I think it is just a subjective illusion on our head.

21:43.000 --> 21:47.000
It is a real relation between us and the environment.

21:47.000 --> 21:53.000
Just like evolution is a real relation between an organism and its environment.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
It's not a property of the environment.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
It's not a property of the organism.

21:57.000 --> 22:02.000
It's a real relation between them that explains both the history of the organism

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
and the history of the environment.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
So that would be a lovely thing to see if we can get clear

22:06.000 --> 22:11.000
because that's a very profound argument, like a profound debate.

22:11.000 --> 22:15.000
There are Heideggerians who took opposite positions on that.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
Yes, I'm aware of that.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
And some of them were psychologists, right?

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
And so I'm just going to outline it for the audience

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
and to make sure we're thinking about it the same way.

22:23.000 --> 22:27.000
One stance is that meaning, so to speak,

22:27.000 --> 22:32.000
is a consequence of the operation of these elaborate patterns of construction

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
in your mind and that you're imposing that on the world.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
So it's like a structure issue.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Yeah, that's a romantic issue with meaning.

22:38.000 --> 22:42.000
And then the other one is that meaning is in the world, so to speak,

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
and that what you do with the structures in your head is limited and narrow it.

22:45.000 --> 22:49.000
And I think in some weird way both of those things are true.

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
But here's something that I've been thinking about for a long time

22:53.000 --> 22:57.000
and I want you to maybe help me figure out a bit more.

22:57.000 --> 23:02.000
So I'm going to go at this from two perspectives.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
So back in the late 1800s,

23:05.000 --> 23:09.000
Nietzsche basically formalized a set of observations

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
about what he thought was happening in Western society

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
and then the world at large, right?

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
And the basic argument was something like this,

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
was that the metaphysical presuppositions of religious systems

23:18.000 --> 23:22.000
and the metaphysical presuppositions of scientific systems were not in sync.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
They weren't of the same paradigm.

23:24.000 --> 23:28.000
And that as Western scientific investigation had preceded,

23:28.000 --> 23:34.000
it became obvious that either the truths of religion weren't true

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
or at least that they weren't of the type that science recognized as truth.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
And Nietzsche basically described that as the death of God.

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
And so he said that three things would happen in the aftermath of that.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
He was a prophet. He was like an Old Testament prophet.

23:49.000 --> 23:55.000
He said that totalitarianism would become unbelievably attractive to people,

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
especially in its hyper-socialist variants like communism,

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
and that millions of people would die in the 20th century as a consequence of that

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
and that it would be a necessary battle.

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
And he said that like 40 years before the Russian Revolution

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
and so like, yeah, go Nietzsche.

24:10.000 --> 24:14.000
You try to predict the future like five years ahead, see how far you get.

24:14.000 --> 24:21.000
And then the other thing he said would be that nihilism would rise to pathological proportions

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
because it's basically the polar opposite of totalitarianism, right?

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
You wipe out the religious structures.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
People move towards ideology to reattain that certainty,

24:29.000 --> 24:34.000
but it's rigid and deadly, or they fall off into chaos itself.

24:34.000 --> 24:38.000
Okay, then Nietzsche made one more proposition which was that

24:39.000 --> 24:44.000
the only solution to that would be for human beings to transform themselves

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
into meaning-creating creatures.

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
And so what Nietzsche basically did, and I think this was a mistake in his metaphysics,

24:51.000 --> 24:55.000
was that he assumed that the objective description of reality was correct,

24:55.000 --> 24:59.000
that reality in and of itself was dead and meaningless,

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
but that human beings could interact with that in such a way

25:02.000 --> 25:06.000
as a consequence of their individual choices to make that richly meaningful.

25:06.000 --> 25:11.000
And that we needed to do that because the alternatives would be nihilism or totalitarianism.

25:11.000 --> 25:15.000
One more comment on that.

25:15.000 --> 25:19.000
So, you know, Jung was a student of Nietzsche, a profound student,

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
and he was actually trying to solve the problem that Nietzsche put forward,

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
which was, oh, wow, we got nihilism on the one hand

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
and we got totalitarianism on the other hand,

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
and, you know, those don't really seem to be very good solutions

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
since millions of people die because of one

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
and millions of people commit suicide because of the other.

25:35.000 --> 25:39.000
It's like those are suboptimal solutions in all likelihood.

25:39.000 --> 25:45.000
So, but Jung in some sense took issue with Nietzsche's fundamental proposition,

25:45.000 --> 25:49.000
which was that human beings were meaning creating creatures.

25:49.000 --> 25:53.000
And I actually think it's the most profound critique of Nietzsche

25:53.000 --> 25:58.000
because what Jung pointed out, this is something that just blew me away when I first understood it,

25:58.000 --> 26:03.000
and it has to do with your relevance realization issue in a deadly way.

26:03.000 --> 26:08.000
It's like, imagine the things that attract your attention and your interest.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Well, okay, so then you might think,

26:10.000 --> 26:15.000
well, is that a voluntary process or an involuntary process?

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
And to answer that, you can think about it.

26:17.000 --> 26:21.000
It's like you're working on some dismally wretched, boring,

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
and stultifying thing at work or as a student,

26:24.000 --> 26:28.000
and your attention is like fragmented everywhere.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
You think about the dust bunnies under your bed

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
and that maybe the dishes need to be done

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
or maybe the rug needs to be walked

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
and the rug needs to be vacuumed

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
and it's like bloody well anything other than that boring task.

26:39.000 --> 26:43.000
Even though you know you have to do it in order to say pass a course

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
or pass an exam or get the assignment done,

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
you can't control your damn brain.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
It's wandering everywhere.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
And then, so the weird thing about that

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
is that you cannot voluntarily control your relevance realization.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
And then you have the contrary problem,

26:57.000 --> 27:02.000
which is that there's a YouTube video about kittens

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
and it's like bang man, you're focused on that.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
And so one of the things you might ask

27:08.000 --> 27:12.000
is just who the hell is in control of this relevance realization?

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
And that was Jung's question.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
It was like, well where Nietzsche fell apart,

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
Nietzsche fell apart was that he assumed that human beings

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
were primarily meaning making creatures.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
But then if you try it, it's like,

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
hey, I'm going to find it really meaningful to go to the gym

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
three times a week next week for half an hour

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
and I'm going to push myself right to my limits.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
It's like I have every reason for doing it.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
I know why I should do it,

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
but I'd rather sit on the couch in my underwear and eat cheetes.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Cheetos.

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
So you've got to ask yourself, man, who's in charge.

27:49.000 --> 27:53.000
And one of the things that the psychodynamic theorists were so damn good at

27:53.000 --> 27:58.000
was pointing out that, well, you think it's you, but it's not.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
And so then that begs the question.

28:00.000 --> 28:04.000
It's like, where's the meaning coming from and who is in charge?

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
And so I know that's questions that you're trying to answer,

28:07.000 --> 28:11.000
but it doesn't exactly seem to me that we're overlaying that on the world

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
or that if we are, we don't have much voluntary control over that.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
Okay, well, I don't think we're overlaying it on the world

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
and that's what I meant by a real relation

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
and I was comparing it to evolution.

28:21.000 --> 28:26.000
I think to talk about us being meaning makers in the Nietzschean sense

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
is to fall prey to the romantic illusion

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
that the world is a blank slate.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
I mean, you have the blank slate of the enlightenment

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
in which reason the world writes on us

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
and then you have the blank slate of the romantics

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
in which the world is a blank slate,

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
like the unpainted canvas that we...

28:45.000 --> 28:49.000
And Nietzsche constantly used the artistic metaphor

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
and even created the idea of a lifestyle

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
as if our lives are works of art

28:54.000 --> 28:58.000
because the world is just an empty canvas upon which we project our meaning.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
Well, and there's totalitarian presuppositions in there too

29:01.000 --> 29:05.000
because one of the presuppositions of totalitarian ideologues

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
is that there is no such thing as human nature

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
and that people can be constructed in any way possible.

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
Exactly, and that's why existentialism comes out of Nietzsche

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
because existentialism posits that our essence and our nature

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
is completely the property of our own self-definition.

29:18.000 --> 29:23.000
So what I'm actually doing is I'm rejecting both of those blank slates.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
I'm saying the world is neither a blank slate

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
that we romantically project upon

29:27.000 --> 29:32.000
nor is the mind a blank slate that experience just empirically draws upon.

29:32.000 --> 29:37.000
What I'm proposing instead is a dynamic interaction between the two

29:37.000 --> 29:43.000
and to say that who's in charge is kind of an odd question

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
but before I answer that,

29:45.000 --> 29:49.000
I want to take a little bit of exception on your interpretation of Nietzsche

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
because I think it might help

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
and it also might get us back to the Newton-Darwin thing

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
which I promise to get back to too.

29:57.000 --> 30:03.000
I mean, Nietzsche lays, and again, Heidegger followed up on this,

30:03.000 --> 30:07.000
he actually lays the history of nihilism much further back.

30:07.000 --> 30:10.000
He says that the history of nihilism starts with Plato

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
and that Christianity is just Plato for the masses

30:13.000 --> 30:17.000
because my interpretation of Nietzsche is that the main cause of nihilism

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
goes back to the Acts of Revolution.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
It's the creation of the two-world model

30:22.000 --> 30:27.000
and the idea is that this world gets its meaning, its value,

30:27.000 --> 30:31.000
it has an instrumental value in getting us to some other world,

30:31.000 --> 30:35.000
to some world in which we will finally find the fulfillment

30:35.000 --> 30:39.000
and the protection from horror that we don't find in this world,

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
a heaven, right?

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
And then what happens, right?

30:43.000 --> 30:47.000
It wasn't just the clash between the scientific and the religious worldview.

30:47.000 --> 30:52.000
What happens is that the scientific worldview calls the second world,

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
the heavenly world, into question.

30:54.000 --> 31:00.000
But what happened is we have millennia of Christianity and Platonism

31:00.000 --> 31:05.000
tutoring us to believe that this world is not meaningful in itself

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
because it's only valuable insofar as we get to this heaven.

31:08.000 --> 31:12.000
And when science says, I imagine that there is no heaven,

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
or John Lennon, right?

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Then we're left.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
My favorite beatle.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
We're left, right?

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
That really dates me, doesn't it?

31:21.000 --> 31:25.000
Then we're left with this world that we've been tutored for millennia,

31:25.000 --> 31:28.000
has no value in it.

31:28.000 --> 31:32.000
And so I think what Nietzsche was trying to do,

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
I agree with you, there's a romantic streak in Nietzsche

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
and like I said, I reject that romantic streak

31:36.000 --> 31:40.000
that the world is a blank slate upon which we paint our lifestyles.

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
That is ridiculously hubristic in nature.

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
But there was another thing Nietzsche was trying to do,

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
and so I think there's, I mean Nietzsche has multiple voices,

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
it has anything.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
So in addition to the romantic project,

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
which I often find really bombastic,

31:54.000 --> 31:58.000
there is another project that he called trying to revalue the earth,

31:58.000 --> 32:03.000
which was to try to see the earth as a place in which we could be at home.

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
On its own terms, for its own sake.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
So that was more Heidegger, I think.

32:09.000 --> 32:14.000
No, no, Heidegger talks about learning how to revalue the earth

32:14.000 --> 32:18.000
and loving the earth as a repeated theme throughout Nietzsche's work,

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
and loving the body is a repeated theme in Nietzsche's work.

32:21.000 --> 32:25.000
Because he thought that just like we had the two worlds,

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
we had the two parts of us, we had the body,

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
but the body only existed in service of the soul,

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
and the body therefore has no inherent value,

32:33.000 --> 32:37.000
because its only job is to get the soul to the only place where it has real meaning,

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
which is heaven.

32:38.000 --> 32:42.000
And then his point was, if we lose the heaven and if we lose the idea of the soul,

32:42.000 --> 32:46.000
we have to get back to revaluing the body, revaluing the earth.

32:46.000 --> 32:50.000
And what I'm proposing in this sort of evolutionary model of relevance realisation

32:50.000 --> 32:55.000
is exactly that the body and the earth co-create this real relation

32:55.000 --> 32:59.000
that fundamentally homes us and fits us into the world.

32:59.000 --> 33:03.000
And that the meaning crisis and therefore, it's not just...

33:03.000 --> 33:07.000
I mean, yes, I agree, there are definitely historical forces for it

33:07.000 --> 33:12.000
and the rise of science and the demise of the wisdom traditions and the religious traditions.

33:12.000 --> 33:15.000
But I think the meaning crisis is in some sense also a perennial problem.

33:15.000 --> 33:18.000
You see it cross-culturally, you see it cross-historically,

33:18.000 --> 33:22.000
because people can always get trapped between these two kinds of perspectives

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
they can have on themselves.

33:23.000 --> 33:26.000
They can always fall prey to these kinds of two world models.

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
And so I think the thing I want to say is

33:33.000 --> 33:38.000
part of what's going on right now in the meaning crisis in the West

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
is we're trying to...

33:39.000 --> 33:42.000
And this is the way Nietzsche, I think, was prescient, as you said.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
He was a prophet.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
By the way, he predicted four things.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
He predicted that he would be famous eventually.

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
Although that he would basically starve to death in the meantime.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
Right, but why I am so great was one of his...

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
Timing is everything.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
Yeah, exactly.

33:59.000 --> 34:04.000
And so what he was prescient about is the fact that...

34:04.000 --> 34:08.000
I mean, basically since the actual age in 800 BCE and onward,

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
we've had this two-world model.

34:10.000 --> 34:13.000
And now we're going through a radical re-embedding.

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
And for a lot of people, that's caused a kind of nihilism.

34:16.000 --> 34:19.000
But one of the things I would throw out to you is that

34:19.000 --> 34:23.000
there's a possibility in an emerging cognitive science,

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
and a cognitive science in which embodiment and embeddiment

34:25.000 --> 34:30.000
are becoming central for appropriating that re-embedding process

34:30.000 --> 34:35.000
as a way of discovering, rediscovering how we can be at home,

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
fundamentally at home in the world,

34:37.000 --> 34:40.000
and how the earth and our bodies co-create that home

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
in a way that, again, protects us from horror

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
and allows us to flourish as cognitive agents.

34:45.000 --> 34:49.000
So you did something I think is lovely,

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
and I don't think that it's people who aren't quite deeply educated can do,

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
is you pushed the problem quite a bit farther back in time.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
So I want to one-up you on that.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
Okay.

34:59.000 --> 35:04.000
So I do think it's a deeper problem than Nietzsche pointed out.

35:04.000 --> 35:08.000
He pointed out the more articulated modern end of it.

35:08.000 --> 35:11.000
And we see that as the conflict, say, between science and religion.

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
But if you can push these sorts of things back,

35:14.000 --> 35:17.000
I think to the dawn of self-consciousness itself.

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
And one of the reasons that I've been so obsessed with the book of Genesis

35:20.000 --> 35:26.000
is because I read Genesis as a dramatic representation

35:26.000 --> 35:29.000
of the coming to self-consciousness of mankind.

35:29.000 --> 35:32.000
Because what happens with Adam and Eve when they eat the fruit

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
that the snake delivers to them,

35:34.000 --> 35:38.000
which is very interesting sort of phenomena from an evolutionary perspective,

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
which I can talk about later,

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
what happens to Adam and Eve is very, very specific.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
I mean, the first thing that happens...

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
I'm sorry, I might get the order wrong.

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
But the first thing that happens is that they realize

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
their eyes are opened and they're like gods

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
knowing the difference between good and evil.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
And that's very interesting,

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
because it associates the development of self-consciousness

35:58.000 --> 36:02.000
and the rise of articulated and complicated morality.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
And so I've thought about that for a long time.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
It's like, okay, you realize you're naked.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
What does that mean?

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Well, you don't want to be naked up here on the stage,

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
if you're speaking properly to the audience you are.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
But maybe you don't want that.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
Okay, well, why?

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
Why don't you want to be up here naked on the stage?

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
It's everyone's nightmare, right?

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
Well, you know, you're kind of flawed and saggy,

36:22.000 --> 36:25.000
and there's parts of you that are not that beautiful,

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
even if you happen to be a supermodel.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
And you're not as bright as you could be,

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
and your hair might be going a little bit,

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
and your teeth aren't that great,

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
and you're not as smart as you could be,

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
and you've got a lot of flaws,

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
plus you're going to get sick, and then you're going to die.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
It's like, right, right.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
So that's all nakedness.

36:43.000 --> 36:46.000
If you think about nakedness as vulnerability.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
And so we had to come to terms with her vulnerability

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
when we became self-conscious.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
So then you might think,

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
well, what the hell does that have to do with morality?

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
And I did figure that out.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
It took me like 15 years of thinking to figure that out.

36:57.000 --> 37:01.000
It's like, if I know I'm naked and vulnerable,

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
and I know you are the same,

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
then I know what will hurt me.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
And once I know what will hurt me,

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
I know what will hurt you.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
And so animals prey on each other.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
Lions eat gazelles,

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
and worms eat lions, and all of that.

37:17.000 --> 37:20.000
But there's nothing like a human being

37:20.000 --> 37:23.000
for sheer outright atrocious torture.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
And you don't get that without self-consciousness.

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
So that's where I think the knowledge of good and evil comes.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
It's like it's no longer prey and predator.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
It's like torture and victim.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
So that's one thing.

37:35.000 --> 37:39.000
And part of that sets up this dichotomy in human beings

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
between whatever it is that our consciousness seems to be

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
and our self-consciousness,

37:44.000 --> 37:47.000
and this terrible, limited burden that we carry around

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
as a body that we're conscious of.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
So there's that dichotomy.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
That dichotomy emerges back at the beginning

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
of the dichotomy of self-consciousness.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
It's a problem we're trying to solve all the time.

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
And I mean, Nietzsche's criticism of Christianity

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
was that he believed that Christianity

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
failed to solve that problem

38:06.000 --> 38:09.000
because instead of dealing with the reality of the catastrophe,

38:09.000 --> 38:12.000
which is, say, the degenerate form of our material body,

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
the church basically damned that to perdition,

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
describing it as a work of the devils, so to speak,

38:18.000 --> 38:21.000
and then concentrated on spiritual salvation.

38:21.000 --> 38:28.000
Now, you knew this element of Christian religious thought

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
and the Nietzschean transformations of that,

38:30.000 --> 38:33.000
and that's part of the reason why he went back to alchemy,

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
because one of the things Jung was interested in was

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
why did science develop?

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
It only developed in Europe as far as we know,

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
and the Greeks didn't have it, and the Romans didn't have it,

38:43.000 --> 38:46.000
and the Chinese didn't have it, and the Indians didn't have it,

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
and it's like, well, they weren't stupid.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
What was up with them and why Europe?

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
What exactly happened there?

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
It's not like we precisely know the answer to that,

38:54.000 --> 38:57.000
but one of the things that Jung suggested,

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
and it's brilliant as far as I'm concerned,

39:00.000 --> 39:06.000
the cognitive apparatuses that we're blessed with are compensatory,

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
so that if we formulate a theory about one domain

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
and take it to a real extreme,

39:11.000 --> 39:17.000
the unconscious mind will start to formulate a counter proposition,

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
which is formulated of all the things we notice

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
that don't fit in with that theory,

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
and then they start to flap around

39:24.000 --> 39:28.000
and associate with each other as a consequence of emotional contagion,

39:28.000 --> 39:31.000
and they start to manifest themselves in patterns,

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
and that once that counter position emerges

39:34.000 --> 39:38.000
as a sufficiently complex and dynamic living system,

39:38.000 --> 39:41.000
it has the opportunity to fight with the other system,

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
and sometimes you'll have a revelation,

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
and the revelation is basically the overthrow

39:45.000 --> 39:48.000
of the current perspective by the new emergent perspective.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.000
Jung viewed alchemy in that light.

39:52.000 --> 39:56.000
He said that the Christian concentration on hyper-spiritualization

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
was extremely useful, this is something Nietzsche agreed with,

39:58.000 --> 40:01.000
was unbelievably useful for the discipline of the mind,

40:01.000 --> 40:04.000
so Nietzsche, of course, is an anti-Christian,

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
at least that's what he said,

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
but he also said that Catholicism tempered the European spirit

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
like nothing else could have,

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
and he really meant the whole Judeo-Christian tradition,

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
which was the attempt to force everything

40:16.000 --> 40:20.000
into a unified and hierarchically arranged interpretation.

40:20.000 --> 40:23.000
Nietzsche's idea was once you did that once, man,

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
you could go do that all sorts of different places,

40:25.000 --> 40:30.000
so alchemy as a precursor to science

40:30.000 --> 40:33.000
was based initially on a fantasy,

40:33.000 --> 40:37.000
and the fantasy was if we paid enough attention

40:37.000 --> 40:41.000
to the transformations of matter rather than of spirit,

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
that we could redeem what Christianity,

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
with its emphasis on the spirit, had failed to redeem.

40:47.000 --> 40:50.000
So it was sort of like all the 14th century Europeans woke up

40:50.000 --> 40:53.000
and said, hmm, Christ died for our sins,

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
and we're supposed to be redeemed,

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
but a lot of guys are down there with leprosy in the ditch,

40:57.000 --> 41:01.000
so it doesn't seem to have exactly fulfilled its promise,

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
and so he felt that the European imagination

41:03.000 --> 41:07.000
started to drift into the transformations of the material world,

41:07.000 --> 41:13.000
but that was also part of what was fundamentally a redemptive process.

41:13.000 --> 41:16.000
It was just a more comprehensive redemptive process.

41:16.000 --> 41:19.000
It was, all right, well, we kind of got the spirit organized,

41:19.000 --> 41:22.000
now it's time to do something about the dreadful body

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
that we're dragging around with us

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
instead of merely damning it to perdition.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
And one of the things that you might think about,

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
because we're also thinking about practical issues here,

41:31.000 --> 41:35.000
is, well, we talked about multiple meanings,

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
kind of multiple low-level meanings.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
There's the meaning of food and the meaning of water

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
and the meaning of sex and, you know,

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
the meaning of being too hot and too cold,

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
and there's all biological subsystems

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
that take care of those sorts of things.

41:47.000 --> 41:50.000
It's like those are organized hierarchically in principle,

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
so there's something lurking at the top.

41:52.000 --> 41:55.000
And I think part of what religious mythologies do over years,

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
centuries, thousands of years,

41:57.000 --> 42:01.000
is try to get a picture of what should be at the top.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
That's like the monotheistic impulse.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
What's the highest value?

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
And here's something to consider.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
You know, you can wonder about this in your own lives

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
when people think about the meaning of their life.

42:11.000 --> 42:16.000
What they mean is, are all the subsidiary meanings

42:16.000 --> 42:20.000
meaningful given that there's an ultimate reality

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
of suffering and limitation.

42:22.000 --> 42:25.000
And so one of the things that might be asked,

42:25.000 --> 42:28.000
and I think that scientists do ask this in part,

42:28.000 --> 42:31.000
is maybe we shouldn't deal with that question

42:31.000 --> 42:35.000
before we fix everything we can possibly fix.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
And so one of the things that I would also suggest

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
is that when you're motivated by meanings

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
that are other than subsidiary,

42:42.000 --> 42:46.000
say the same meanings that animate mammals and reptiles

42:46.000 --> 42:49.000
and even bloody lobsters, for that matter,

42:49.000 --> 42:52.000
when you're working at higher-order levels of meaning,

42:52.000 --> 42:55.000
partly what you're attempting to do

42:55.000 --> 42:59.000
is to generate solutions to the micro-problems

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
of negative meaning that always beset you.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
You know, it's like, well,

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
is there something wrong in your family?

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
Well, that's meaningful.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
The meaning is negative.

43:09.000 --> 43:12.000
So does that make your family worthwhile or worthless?

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
Well, the question is,

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
depends on what you do with your family.

43:16.000 --> 43:19.000
And you know, so the problem with nihilism,

43:19.000 --> 43:22.000
as far as I can tell, is that the nihilist presumes

43:22.000 --> 43:25.000
that the finitude that we perceive

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
invalidates the utility of being.

43:27.000 --> 43:31.000
It's like, well, that's pretty arrogant, you might say.

43:31.000 --> 43:34.000
You might say that judging the whole world in that light,

43:34.000 --> 43:37.000
which is what that comedian just did on that TV show

43:37.000 --> 43:40.000
that he laid into God, I can't remember his name,

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
blaming him for bone cancer and children, for example,

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
which really does suck, you know.

43:44.000 --> 43:47.000
So the point is, is that one of the things

43:47.000 --> 43:50.000
that we find meaningful and we could find meaningful

43:50.000 --> 43:53.000
and that's reliable is,

43:53.000 --> 43:56.000
let's leave the damn question aside about the ultimate meaning

43:56.000 --> 43:59.000
of reality in its corrupt form, which is now,

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
and try to fix the damn thing.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
Really try to fix it.

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
And then see what happens,

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
it's clear that we can make things better

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
and it's bloody clear that we can make things worse,

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
so you might ask, okay, well, if you organized

44:11.000 --> 44:14.000
your little value hierarchy underneath the proposition

44:14.000 --> 44:17.000
that it's up to you to work to bring the kingdom of God

44:17.000 --> 44:21.000
to life instead of hell, then maybe the whole problem

44:21.000 --> 44:24.000
of the negative meaning of life would go away.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
It's like you never know, beats the alternative,

44:26.000 --> 44:29.000
which is to damn the whole thing to perdition,

44:29.000 --> 44:32.000
which we really tried hard to do in the 20th century

44:32.000 --> 44:35.000
with a fair bit of success, or just to think,

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
oh, well, this is meaningless and useless

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
and I don't have any responsibility

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
and there's no such thing as meaning,

44:41.000 --> 44:44.000
and it's like, sure, walk down that road, man,

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
see where you go.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
Okay.

44:49.000 --> 44:53.000
It seems the both of you agree that there's this

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
lower level meaning system that we have,

44:55.000 --> 44:58.000
which is almost like a moment to moment perceptual system

44:58.000 --> 45:01.000
where we know how to interact with things.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
And both of you disagree, both of you agree

45:03.000 --> 45:07.000
that there's no higher level, the meaning of life.

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
But in alluding to the meaning crisis

45:09.000 --> 45:12.000
and just general morality, you seem to assume

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
that we can somehow cobble this ability

45:14.000 --> 45:17.000
to know how to interact with the glass,

45:17.000 --> 45:20.000
to somehow interact with societies.

45:20.000 --> 45:24.000
So how do you think we're able to do this?

45:24.000 --> 45:27.000
First of all, to be careful,

45:28.000 --> 45:31.000
and I said there's no ultimate meaning,

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
and like I said, I was also not saying

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
that that means that there's no ultimate meaning

45:35.000 --> 45:38.000
because if you say a problem is poorly formed,

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
you're rejecting both the positive

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
and the negative answer to that question.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
It doesn't imply that, therefore,

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
the ultimate meaning is that there's no meaning.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
It's like saying what's north of the North Pole.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
The answer is not anything.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
It's to reject the question.

45:52.000 --> 45:55.000
So I first want to challenge that move you made.

45:55.000 --> 45:58.000
Secondly, I do think that...

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
I want to reply...

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
I do think that what I'm trying to argue for,

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
and I think Jordan is, but I'm not clear

46:04.000 --> 46:07.000
because he said about 17,000 things in his last thing.

46:07.000 --> 46:10.000
I want to try and reply to them.

46:12.000 --> 46:15.000
I'll spin them out, you sort of.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
I'm arguing for a deep continuity

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
between those lower level processes

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
and the highest levels.

46:23.000 --> 46:26.000
And I think Nietzsche tried to foreshadow that,

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
and this is again what I mean about the...

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
Nietzsche said, the height of my spirituality

46:30.000 --> 46:33.000
reaches into the depth of my sexuality.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
To try and find...

46:35.000 --> 46:38.000
He was using both of those in a metaphorical extension.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
I'm not only arguing for the lower level...

46:40.000 --> 46:43.000
It's a pretty good statement for a virgin, too.

46:48.000 --> 46:51.000
He was referring to Nietzsche, by the way, not me.

46:54.000 --> 46:57.000
So I'm arguing for what I think is a very important thesis,

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
which is a deep continuity between the lower level

47:00.000 --> 47:03.000
and, just speaking of it metaphorically, the higher level.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
I do think there is an important issue

47:05.000 --> 47:08.000
in which we can talk about that higher level

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
as distinct from the lower level

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
of just trying to solve our daily problems,

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
which I think is important.

47:14.000 --> 47:17.000
Namely, and that's something that I think is important,

47:17.000 --> 47:20.000
is that we can talk about that higher level

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
of problems, which I think is important.

47:22.000 --> 47:25.000
Namely, and that's something that you referenced, Jordan.

47:25.000 --> 47:28.000
We face a perennial problem of our self-consciousness,

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
and the problem with our self-consciousness

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
is it means we have this enormous capacity

47:32.000 --> 47:35.000
to take a perspective on our own ability to take perspectives.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
I mean, one of the things about being a conscious being,

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
and this is what I mean about a salient's landscape,

47:39.000 --> 47:42.000
is we not only know facts, like propositions,

47:42.000 --> 47:45.000
and we know how to do things,

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
we also have perspectival knowing.

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
This is the work I did with Leo Ferraro.

47:49.000 --> 47:52.000
We know what it is like to be a certain thing,

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
to take a certain perspective,

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
to take a certain stance on the world.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
I know what it's like to be a father.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
I know what it's like to be a teacher.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
And that perspectival knowing,

48:02.000 --> 48:05.000
of knowing what it's like to be something,

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
is, again, this atmospheric meaning.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
But the thing we can do

48:09.000 --> 48:12.000
is we can take a perspective on that lower-order perspective.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
We can stand back and say,

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
what does that perspective look like?

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Let me give you an example.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
I'm thirsty.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
And so I have a thirsting perspective on the world.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
Things that are watery are salient to me.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
Things that might contain water.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
You're getting thirsty right now, too, right?

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
It becomes salient to me.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
But I can step back,

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
and this was something also discovered in India,

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
by the Buddhists,

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
I can step back

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
and take a look at my thirsting perspective.

48:40.000 --> 48:43.000
I can say, what's it like to be a thirsty person?

48:43.000 --> 48:46.000
And now I'm no longer thirsting,

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
because I'm now motivated

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
by something different than my thirst.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
I'm motivated by my curiosity

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
about my lower-order thirst.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
And then I can step back

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
and say, gee,

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
what's it like to be curious?

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
And then I can step back and wonder,

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
what's it like to be somebody asking

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
what's it like to be curious?

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
And then you can step back and say,

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
what's it like watching someone

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
listen to someone talk about being curious about it?

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
Exactly.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
That's what I'm trying to make.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
The point I'm trying to make

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
is what happens is

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
we have the capacity

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
to very quickly

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
move ourselves to what Nagel calls the view from nowhere.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
To this bird's eye

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
or God's eye perspective

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
on all of reality,

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
in which we, by these recursive

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
asking of questions,

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
we have become deeply disengaged

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
from our involvement with the world.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
We have an enormous capacity

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
for self-transcendence.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
And I think this was also one of Nietzsche's insights,

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
although I think Nishitani called him

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
excellently to question on it.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
Our capacity for self-transcendence,

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
our ability to rise above ourselves,

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
is also the very same thing

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
that can cause us to fall into despair

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
and absurdity.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
Because we can empty the world

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
of all that involved meaning

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
by our capacity to transcend ourselves

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
to such a degree

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
that we are overlooking it all

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
for like five seconds here.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
Okay, so I have a proposition

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
that goes along with this. You guys can think about this.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
And I think

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
it's one of the advantages

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
of contemplating the notion

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
that meaning might be an actual phenomena

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
in and of itself. So I would say

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
you might say, well, when should you stop

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
recursing? Which is

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
what's the right level of analysis? Because I could say

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
who cares about this damn talk? The Sun

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
is going to envelop the Earth in four billion years.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
It's like, you know, because that's

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
the ultimate meaninglessness of everything.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
And my answer to that is

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
that's a stupid place to stand.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
And the evidence for that

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
is, think about it this way, is that

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
if your capacity to experience

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
the kind of meaning that imbues your

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
life with

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
forward motion and with faith

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
and with joy and with gratitude,

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
imagine that that's actually a function

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
that you have psychologically.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
And then imagine that that function

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
kicks in when you're looking at

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
things from the right perspective.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
And so you might say, well

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
is this talk important? It's like

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
what's important to me right now? It seems to be

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
important to you guys. It has some potential

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
importance tomorrow and next week.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
There's all meaning there. Is it

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
important from the perspective

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
of the age of the cosmos?

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
Well,

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
probably, but probably

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
perhaps not.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
And so then I would say, well what does that do to

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
my sense of engagement with the issues at hand?

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
It undermines them and I fall into

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
a pit of meaninglessness and so then

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
I would say, well, hey let's not fall into that pit.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
Let's pick a level of analysis

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
for the problem at hand

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
that most richly imbues it

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
with a sense of meaning and then

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
let's assume that that's part of the mechanism

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
that calibrates our soul, so to speak

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
and pay attention to that.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
And so because I tell my students this all the time.

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
Wander around

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
and notice what's

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
meaningful to you. Just notice it.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
It happens. You

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
can participate and you're absolutely right about that.

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
But it happens. Okay.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
Try to stay where meaning

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
is optimized. And then I also

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
mention to them briefly

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
that that's kind of what the Taoist symbol is about

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
because the Taoist symbol is predicated

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
on the idea in a sense

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
that the world is made out of disorder,

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
chaos and order and

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
that there's a balance between those two things

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
and that if you stand on

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
the border between order and chaos

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
so that things are structured properly

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
but you're still a little uncertain and curious

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
then that's a richly meaningful

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
place from a phenomenological perspective

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
and it's like that's the right place

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
to stand. How do you know?

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
Because you want to be alive despite

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
the fact that you're suffering. It's like

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
hey, there's some evidence. You can't get

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
there though without, you know, the initial

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
presupposition that there's something deeply

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
real about meaning and

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
I think real is life sustaining

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
that's part of what real is. That's a

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
Nietzschean idea too. Okay, well

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
let me respond to that.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
I want to push back on you on that a bit

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
because I think that's not being fair to

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
Nagle's argument because the point Nagle was trying

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
to make is, you know, you said

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
that's a stupid place to stand. It depends on what you're trying

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
to achieve. Right, if you're trying to do

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
science and you're trying to reduce

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
the way we self-deceptively

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
project bias onto the world

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
then you progressively move to

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
these higher views because

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
every time you, I mean

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
that is what we do. That is how we try to reduce

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
bias. I mean, when I can take a

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
the reason I, it's good for me to take

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
a perspective on my lower-order perspective

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
is it helps me to determine bias

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
and distortion in this perspective.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
So if I want to remove bias and distortion

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
if I want to get at reality and truth

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
and let's assume we have that platonic drive

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
then that feeds into

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
this drive to go higher and higher

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
and higher and higher

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
because as I go higher and higher and higher

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
I am removing distortion. I am

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
removing illusion.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
That seems to me to be, that's

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
partly why I'm a pragmatist, fundamentally

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
and it's because you're right

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
about that. Yeah, but pragmatism

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
is parasitic on an independent notion of truth.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
You have to be able to know

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
independent of its usefulness that

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
something is useful.

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
You have to have some way of saying

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
I know that it's true that this

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
is useful, that my perception

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
of its usefulness is not itself distorted.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Okay, I'm not disagreeing with that at all.

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
I think that what

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
correct me if I'm wrong.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
You basically

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
you seem to be making an argument that goes

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
something like this, is that

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
there are different lenses and different

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
levels of resolution for different tasks.

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
That's right. I agree with that.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
Absolutely. But I'm also making the argument

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
that

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
the drive towards the view from nowhere

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
has just as deep

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
a purchase on us. That platonic quest

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
to get at the

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
the undistorted. We shouldn't

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
be assuming that nowhere is the ultimate

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
stance. It's like it has

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
its zone of relevance and you've laid

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
that out quite nicely. That's exactly what

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
I'm saying. But what I'm trying to say is

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
just to say to someone

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
don't go as far

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
as you can because you might

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
fall into absurdity

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
to me sounds like

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
well, give into

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
self deception because

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
that will be comforting.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
I guess this is partly

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
my experience as

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
a clinician speaking as well.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
Because sometimes people get overwhelmed

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
by absurdity. They don't go there.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
You know what I mean? It's not the right place

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
for them to be. But I would also say

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
that you shouldn't pick problems that are bigger

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
than the ones that you can solve.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
I disagree with you.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
We've got to clarify that because I don't think that you

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
I mean we're doing that right now.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
I know.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
I know. But we're also

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
not claiming to have the answer.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
But that value as I said from the beginning

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
isn't in the answer. But in the

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
self-transcendent transformation of the question.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
And what I

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
was trying to say

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
is that

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
yes, I agree that

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
right

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
I don't think

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
absurdity is caused by

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
the fact that you're

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
the highest level. I mean again

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
that's not Navel's point. Absurdity is caused

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
by the fact that we can

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
find a clash between any

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
two levels we pick. He gives this example.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
Okay. Okay. So

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
he gives this example and

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
please understand this because we're

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
older than you. There was a time

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
there was a time when people's

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
phones were in specific

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
locations.

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
And if somebody called

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
you you were often not with your phone

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
and so you had to have a recording device

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
to pick up the messages.

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
I know we had just discovered

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
fire but that's what it was like.

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
So he gives the example from

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
that time because he wrote the article in the early 80s

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
and so there's this individual

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
he calls up and they're like

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
and he picks up the here's the pickup

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
and he says he's been all prepared. He says

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
Susan, just don't talk. I got to

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
tell you this. I got to get it out. I

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
love you. I've loved you for a long time. It's really

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
interesting. And then he hears

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
Susan's not here right now.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
Please leave a message.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
And you're laughing because

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
humor is also about this juxtaposition

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
of perspectives.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
And what's happened is that

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
act that seems so meaningful from

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
one's perspective is completely

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
inconsistent with the machine's

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
perspective, the recording

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
machine. It's the clash between

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
perspectives, not a particular

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
perspective per se

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
that I think is what the experience of

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
absurdity is. It could be and

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
but it might be or.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Well, I think no because

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
here's why I would challenge you. Okay, okay.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Because I would put Spinoza against

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
Nietzsche. Spinoza advocating

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
advocated going to that highest

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
view and then found a way to reconcile

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
it with the lowest perspective

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
the engaged perspective and he said that was

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
the blessed life. Okay, okay. So he argued

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
that the, I mean I think

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
that's why The Ethics is a great book that deserves

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
to be read in contrast to Nietzsche, right?

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
Is he argued that there

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
is a way to reconcile

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
those two perspectives. He called it

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
Scantia Intuitiva. And it's the

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
reconciliation of those two perspectives

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
that alleviates absurdity.

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
Not the preclusion of going to one

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
or the remaining in fixed in the other.

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
And I think that that's very

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
in a very, that's very similar

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
in some profoundly important ways.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
There's important historical differences to what Buddhism

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
is trying to advocate.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
Buddhism is about

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
you know, in meditative practice

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
we practice sort of going deeply immersive

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
and in contemplative practice we go

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
deeply out and then the point in Buddhism

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
is that those are supposed to become

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
eventually completely interpenetrating

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
so that the absurdity that's caused by the clash

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
between perspectives is removed.

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
I think the fault, as you said earlier

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
is not in any perspective but in the

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
self-consciousness that pits perspectives

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
against each other. Good, that's very nice.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
That's very nice. I mean I think that's a very

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
good one. And I

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
take no issue with it.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
I want to take that line of reasoning

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
in a different direction. We'll

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
play that same line of

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
logic in another way.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
So Victor was

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
asking earlier, and it's a level

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
of resolution perspective again. It's like

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
okay, well this is really great, it's the meaning

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
of the glass. It's like well yeah, what does

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
that have to do with the meaning of life?

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
I think the person who answered

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
that best actually was Piaget.

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
Let me tell you a little bit about Piaget

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
because the first thing about

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
he was a famous child developmental psychologist

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
by the way, the most famous of the 20th

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
century. He was actually

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
trying to solve the

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
conflict between religion and science.

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
You never hear that about Piaget but he had

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
messianic experiences when he was a young

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
man and he wrote a novel about it and he wanted

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
to reconcile religion and science.

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
He actually did a pretty damn

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
good job.

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
So here's the issue

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
and you can think about it this way. So this is how

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
a baby builds himself or herself

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
up.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
So learn to move

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
finger.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Learn to move hand.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Learn to move hand and arms.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Learn to move body, hand, arms,

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
legs and feet. Learn to orient

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
head.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Learn to use integrated body

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
to

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
undertake independent tasks.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Then

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
learn to use integrated body that can

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
undertake independent tasks in

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
concert with another integrated

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
body that can undertake

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
specific tasks. You do that when

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
you play a game. The game is

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
we'll say the game is

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
we're two little girls having

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
tea. So what's the goal?

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
The goal is that we learn how

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
to be mutually

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
respectful while we're sharing

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
nourishment, which is a big deal by the way.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
It's something humans are unbelievably good

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
at. It's extremely sophisticated.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
We're very social eaters, so if we're

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
not eating socially, we're fat

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
or anorexic. We

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
have to eat socially to regulate our

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
own behavior because we're social eaters.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
And so we're learning how to play

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
the game of sharing food.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
But the game has other rules than that.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
It's like we're learning how to play the game of sharing food

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
in a way so that we're playing the game

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
so that we want the game to continue.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
So that's an important

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
point. And then if we get more

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
educated, then we say we're learning to play

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
the game so that it's enjoyable

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
for a larger number of people

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
in a larger number of situations

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
across larger spans of time.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
And so that's a hierarchical

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
organization of fundamental abilities

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
into

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
solutions that have generalizability

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
across more and more contexts.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Now Piaget built that way

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
up. And he said

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
this is associated with this idea of

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
levels too.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Piaget believed, and this is

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
his scientific justification for

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
emergent morality in some sense,

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
is that

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
it's within a Darwinian framework, again,

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
not within a Newtonian framework. So Piaget

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
had a proposition, and the proposition

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
was this.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
You're the bully at the moment.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Victor and I are having tea.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
And you want us to play a different game.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
You want us to play, I don't know

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
what do you want us to play? Pull the cat's tail.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
You're a bully after all.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
And so

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
we don't want to play pull the cat's tail.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
And so what do you

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
have to do? Well, you have to

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
expend a lot of time and energy

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
enforcing the game. And the reason you have to do

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
that is because we don't want to play the damn game,

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
so we're going to do everything we can

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
to stop you, to subvert it.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
And so what that means is that you're going to

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
and we're going to expend a tremendous

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
amount of energy in a pursuit

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
where we could have picked a pursuit

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
where there was virtually no energy spent

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
or resources. So Piaget's idea

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
was that an

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
equilibrated game,

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
which is a game that everyone will play voluntarily,

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
if you pit that

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
in an open competition, you could say a Darwinian

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
competition, against

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
a disequilibrated game that requires

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
force to maintain your basic

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
totalitarian state, if you pit

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
those in a one-to-one competition or your

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
totalitarian personality, if you

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
pit them in a one-to-one competition

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
in relationship to the attainment

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
of virtually any goal across

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
multiple contexts, the equilibrated

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
game will win.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
And that's why it's better.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
And there's other reasons too. It's better because

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
it isn't only a solution

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
to a problem that's posed in one place.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
It's a meta-solution

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
to a meta-problem that's posed in many places.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
I'll just give one example.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Okay, so

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
you all tell your kids

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
be a good sport.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
And your kids, being intelligent kids, think

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
well, don't we want to win this game?

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
It's like, of course

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
you want to win the game. Okay, so why can't

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
I bash the guy next to me over the head with

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
my hockey stick, as long as I don't get caught?

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
That's a Canadian example, right?

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
So I'll tell you a story.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
I went to this hockey game once, and my son

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
was playing, and that was really fun.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
And he was in a, like, the final

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
game, and

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
there was a kid on his team who was

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
he was a great hockey player, very, very good

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
hockey player. But

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
it was all him, man.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
He had the puck he wouldn't pass, and he was

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
pretty good at scoring and so on, but he wasn't

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
playing with the team, and he was

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
playing to win. It was fine, fine, fine.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
So my son's

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
team lost. It was a great game. I think it

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
was, like, four to three at the end, and the

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
other team scored in the last 30 seconds or whatever.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
And then all the kids came off the

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
ice, and the parent of this

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
one kid, who's like the little hero

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
hockey player, comes up to him, and

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
the kid had, like, smashed his stick against

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
the cement, and he was all

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
running around and cursing the referees,

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
and the father

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
came running up to him and said,

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
you were robbed. You know, you absolutely should

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
have won that. And I thought,

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
you're such an idiot.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
And he was, he was truly

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
an idiot, and a pathological

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
one at that. And he was

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
really destroying his child's soul.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
And here's, this is

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
not funny. It's true. That is what

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
he was doing. I saw it happen over a long

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
time. That was just a microcosm

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
of their relationship and his attitude towards

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
the world. Now, why was that

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
wrong? It's like, the kid

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
wanted to win. It's like, yay, go

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
man, went to win. He was a

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
really good hockey player.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
So what was wrong with what the father

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
did? Okay. So then we step

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
back and we say, it's

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
not important whether you win or lose. It's how

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
you play the game. So what does that

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
mean? Well, it doesn't actually

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
mean what it says, because it actually is important

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
whether you win or lose. You should be trying

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
to win. But then

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
the question is,

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
what are you trying to win?

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Now, then that

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
gets complicated. It's like

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
while you're trying to win

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
being the best hockey player on your team,

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
are you trying to win that hockey game?

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Or are you

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
trying to win the opportunity to be

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
invited to play as many games as

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
you can possibly play with as many people

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
in as many contexts as you possibly

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
can across the entire course

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
of your life? Okay.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
That's what winning means.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
And so the rule is

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
don't win the

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
local and proximal event

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
at the price of being a

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
player in the multitude of

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
iterable games. That's the moral principle.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
You know? Don't put

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
the cart before the horse, so to speak.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
And the reason for that is that

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
a game is a microcosm of life.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
That's a Piagetian idea, which is why,

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
by the way, we like games and we'll watch

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
them and we're thrilled about them and we engage

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
in them all the time. But the game

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
isn't the issue.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
The issue in some sense is the set

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
of all possible games.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
And the most moral action is

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
the action that will enable you to have

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
the highest probability of winning

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
the set of all possible games.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
And it's even a little more complicated than that,

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
which is you have to be

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
a player in the set of all possible

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
games in a manner that supports the

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
existence of as many games as possible.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
And that's, and so

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
you see what I mean, and human beings can do that

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
because we can go up that damn chain

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
of abstraction, right? We don't have to

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
just concentrate on this

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
or a game of let's make

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
tea, you know? We can play these metagames

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
and pose these metag questions.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
And one of Piaget's claims was

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
don't kid yourself

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
about this. There are rules.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
There are rules. There are rules for games.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
There's lots that aren't playable.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
The rule for a sustainable game is

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
everybody wants to play.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Now, another rule is that some people get

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
to try to win, you know?

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
So, but obviously

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
that's not where the abstraction level

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
tops out. And so I love that.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
It's like, oh, that's so cool.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
There's a hierarchy of moral value

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
because that's action orientation.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
And it's an emergent property of the way

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
that complex systems organize themselves.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
They're basically dominance hierarchies, by the way.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
And not only that, that

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
system of organization has been around

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
for so long, and I think it's

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
about 400 million years,

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
that we're actually biologically

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
adapted to that structure.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Because we know that there are dominance hierarchies

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
that can sustain themselves quite nicely across time.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
And those usually value

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
the individual and the relationship between

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
the individual and society.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
And there's those that don't. And we're really

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
adapted to the ones that do because those are

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
the ones in which we live when we live.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
And so this is deeply biological

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
and it's also emergent at the same time.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
So it's a testament to your notion

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
that it is

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
necessary to be able to reconcile

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
the local view with the ultimate view.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
And the more you can ensure that those

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
levels aren't in conflict with one another,

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
that's exactly what a Piagetian

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
equilibrating state is. Is that the union

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
has been attained across the multiple levels

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
of hierarchical organization.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
That's...

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Take that.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
I will take it. You know

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
that I've always liked

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
this argument of yours. I think it's one of your best.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
And

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
which is not a left handed insult of your other argument.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
I really like this

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
argument. I think it's a good work.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
And I've thought about it and I want to share

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
some thoughts I have about it with you.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
I thought, I think that

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
and this is to allude back to

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Spinoza again in contrast to Nietzsche,

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
I think

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
then again this is the platonic insight.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
I mean because Plato of course had

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
a metaphor also for

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
this moving up the levels. It's the metaphor

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
of coming out of the cave into the real world.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
And I think what I

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
want to say is the highest level

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
of the metagame is the game

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
because games are again things that exist

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
between us and the world, right?

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
I think the highest

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
level of the metagame is the game

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
of intelligibility.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
I mean I think

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
what we have to have

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
ultimately, and this is what Habermas was

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
on about, right? You have to have

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
shareable intelligibility

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
to do. That's the highest

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
thing. We have to constantly

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
be committed to that.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
That the grounding

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
normativity of all of our moral

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
normativities is actually

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
this normative demand make things

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
intelligible. And I think

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
So do you think about that as a

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
precondition for the emergence

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
of cooperative games? Yes. So it's like

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
getting the rules straight.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Getting the language by which you can

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
formulate the rules straight

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
and using language in a very extended

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
metaphor. And so

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
I think

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
part of the issue for us, though as human

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
beings, is

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
that we do have this drive to

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
get at what is, try to

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
to get the

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
maximal intelligibility project. And I think

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
science tries to do that in some ways.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
But

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
the problem is that we then

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
and let me talk for a couple

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
minutes on this. We hit

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
a kind of perennial problem. We have

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
these two different notions

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
vis-a-vis intelligibility about what

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
realness is. And I thought, I wanted

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
to ask you about this because I want to know if this lines up

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
with your chaos order thing.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
We have one notion of

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
realness that what to say

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
that something is real is to say

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
that it is coherent,

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
it is confirmed,

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
it is coherent. Things have

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
come together, right?

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
And there's this mutual

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
fittedness. And then we also

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
have a notion that no, what's real

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
is what catches us by surprise.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
What was outside of our system

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
and that what we didn't know

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
right? And that's when we get at reality.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
So we have these two notions of realness

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
and I think we have two for very

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
good reason by the way. I think we

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
actually have three.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Those are two of them for sure.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
So I think what we have is we do have

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
this confirmation notion

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
and then we have this

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
surprise notion. And science

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
tries to pit the two against each other.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
So what you try to do is you try

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
and do the theory part which is all the

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
confirming coherence part. And then you run

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
experiments in which the world can

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
basically make you go, oh shit.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
And then you've got to, oh, right?

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
At the level you wanted to.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Yes, of course. You don't want to burn down

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
your lab. Or you don't want to horrify yourself

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
oh my god flowers can talk or something like that.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Yeah, too much chemistry there.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Right.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
And so

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
part of the problem though

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
is that although science in one sense

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
tended to try to

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
science is largely

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
to some degree a psychotechnology of trying to

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
integrate those two together so that they work coherently

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
for us but also surprisingly

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
for us. Part of the problem

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
though is when Descartes, and I guess I'll put

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Descartes before the horse here, is

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
what? Is that Nietzsche's horse?

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Yeah.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
We were talking about putting the cart before the horse.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
I was like, Nietzsche,

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Descartes did something

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
he really exacerbated those two

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
and he put a chasm between them.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
He said, look, what's real

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
is sort of what's

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
externally measurable

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
by mathematics. So the mathematical

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
properties are the real properties

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
and all the subjective ones are just in my head.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
But then he said this opposite thing.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
You know what's most real? My mind.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
And how it touches itself.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
And this is completely

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
inexplicable. It's just this direct contact

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
thing. So, and then what he said is

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
right?

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
He didn't ever try to reconcile them

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
and so what we've done in the West

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
is we careen between these two different senses

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
of realness. We careen between

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
real is the mathematical out there-ness.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
No, no, real is the subjective

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
inhere-ness. And you can always

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
pit one against the opposite because

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
this could all be a dream.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Right? Oh, no, no.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
If it was a dream, you'd be naked.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
So I'm a naked bully.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Okay, so

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
but of course

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
then we do the opposite and say,

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
oh, no, that's just an illusion. You're just

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
dreaming and we do the opposite thing.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
And so what I'm suggesting

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
has happened is

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
our attempts to

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
our attempts to

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
ground or get a clear purchase

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
on the metagame

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
are exacerbated

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
by the perennial problem

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
that we have these two conflicting notions of

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
realness. Right? Yeah.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
And then the historical problem that

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Descartes basically

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
put this chasm between these

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
two different notions. He created

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Cartesian dualism. There's

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
these two worlds. This is subjective world

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
and the objective world, they share no properties.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
There's no way to reconcile. And what we do

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
is we constantly there. We constantly

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
undermine. Our notion of

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
realness is rendered permanently

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
unstable. And so

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
I'm not at all challenging you

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
to understand that. I feel like you've just

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
like, tossed me a pumpkin in slow motion

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
so I can bat it out of the park.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Okay, well let me just

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
finish and then I'll let you hit the pumpkin.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Um,

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
so once again

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
what I'm trying to indicate is

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
I think you're right. I think

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
I think it deeply

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
matters to us to reconcile

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
the meta

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
game and the highest meta game I think is

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
the realness game against the lower game

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
and and and I think

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
that is the grounding of our our

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
moral drive. I think that is deeply right.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Now what I'm suggesting to you

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
is there's a perennial problem given

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
our sort of fundamental epistemic

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
machinery that undermines

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
our sense of realness

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
and that is interacting with a historical

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
factor

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Descartes separation of the two worlds

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
and those are now reinforcing each other in a vicious

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
way in our time so that

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
we can't get a stable enough

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
notion of realness so that

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
we can bring about the very reconciliation

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
that you say we long for

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
and we need and that's part and parcel of

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
what I mean when I say we're in a meaning crisis.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
It's great. It's great.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
That's the other one I think. So, okay,

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
so

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
you know

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
there's this there's this brand of psychological

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
thinking that's basically based in

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Freud via a guy named Ernest Becker

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
who wrote a book called The Denial of Death

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
in the 1970s and it won a Pulitzer Prize

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
it's a pretty good book and it takes

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Freud's idea that

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
religion is a

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
defense against death anxiety

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
and it develops that

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
in a very intelligent and comprehensive manner

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
so Becker was trying to update Freudian

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
psychoanalytic theory and kind of had the last

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
word on it and I really think he did that. It's a brilliant

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
book but it's really wrong.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
But it's wrong in a great way which is something

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
to say about a book.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
I'd like to be wrong like that.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Yeah, it'd be great to be wrong like that in some important

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
way. Yeah, absolutely.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
So, first of all, religion

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
one of religion's diverse and

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
multitudinous functions

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
is that it provides some

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
security

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
against the anxiety of death. It's not the reason

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
for it. It's like you got to beware of people

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
who ever say that one thing

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
is the reason for, you know, that's an

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
ideologue, right? It's like, well, it's all

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
economics. It's all sex. It's all

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
fear. It's like, no, it's not.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
That's not right and it's simple-minded

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
and it's wrong.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
So, you know, that's a flaw

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
to some degree in Freudian thinking although he was

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
very smart. He knew about aggression and all sorts

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
of other things. Anyway, it's back to Becker. So there's

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
this idea that

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
our meaning systems

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
that's the internal structure we use to organize

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
the chaos of the world

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
protect us from the anxiety of death.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
And then, so that's one

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
form of meaning for Becker.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
And modern mortality salience.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Yeah, it's the same thing. That's Becker's.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
It's an elaboration of Becker. It doesn't

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
really have much to add to Becker, actually.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
So

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
there's something

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
that's right about that because we do use

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
our belief systems to defend ourselves

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
but we should be very clear about this. Okay,

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
first of all

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
culture is not

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
a belief system.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
I agree. The representation of culture is a belief

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
system. That is not the same thing.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
Culture is what's keeping the electricity

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
on. Okay, and that's not

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
defending us against death anxiety,

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
although it is. It's actually defending us

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
against death, which is much better,

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
right, because we're not sitting outside freezing

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
to death. Right, and that's nothing psychological

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
about that. It's like, there are

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
the lights. It's warm. The floor

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
isn't moving. John isn't attacking me.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
And, you know,

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
seriously, it's like...

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Right.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
That's not belief, man. That is that he's not

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
attacking me. And so

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
we represent that belief and that also

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
makes it somewhat

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
pliable and manipulable and fragile

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
because we can also undermine it, but

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
culture protects us from death

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
and the representation of culture

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
protects us sometimes from death anxiety.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Okay, so now

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Becker also pointed out

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
that there was something else that seemed to give life meaning

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
and that was associated with the Cartesian

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
notion of consciousness. So he thought that

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
people were...

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
apart from being protected from

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
terror, which we needed to be,

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
we also needed to convince ourselves

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
that our lives were worthwhile.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
And we basically did that by deluding

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
ourselves that we were engaged in some

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
sort of heroic project and

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
somehow we could deceive ourselves well

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
enough about the importance of that, through self-deception

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
mostly, that that also added

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
another layer of meaning to our life.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
Okay, the problem with Becker

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
fundamentally was that he didn't read Jung

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
and he said right in the introduction to his book

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
I've never had any patience for Jung

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
and I never thought he said anything to say about

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
in his books on alchemy and that was

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
really too bad because if he would have read them

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
he would have got the book right instead of wrong.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
So, so imagine

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
this way instead. So I wrote a paper

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
a while back called Three Kinds of Meaning.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Okay, so the one

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
meaning is the meaning that announces

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
itself when something that you don't

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
want to have happen happens.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
It's not exactly what you don't

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
predict because we don't predict

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
we want.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Now, part of wanting

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
is predicting. But if you think

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
about it as predicting, you don't take into account

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
motivation. It's a huge mistake.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
We're not like cold, cognitive

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
expectations. No, I agree with that.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Okay, so sometimes things don't turn out

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
the way we want.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
That's meaningful. Sometimes

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
the meaning is kind of cool. It's like

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
you make a joke and I didn't expect it. It's like

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
ha ha! And I laugh because I can

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
transcend the unexpected and that's

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
delight in my own capacity for

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
conscious creation, you know. So that feels

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
really good. And I like the joke because

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
of that. So, and that's not an illusion

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
by the way. It's not self-deception.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
I did transcend the conceptual

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
structure momentarily with you and it's like

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
good for us, you know.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
So, it's not an illusion.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Okay, but now and then something goes

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
unexpected in a way, undesired in a way

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
that we don't like. So, for example

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
you find out that your wife

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
has had like six affairs in the last three

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
months and that she's never been faithful

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
to you at all in the last 20 years.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
It's like

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
that's rough, man.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Especially if you liked her, you know.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Ha ha ha!

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Yeah, well, you know, if you didn't

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
like her, it might be good news.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
But, and I'm actually

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
serious about that too. But okay, so you think

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
well, how upsetting should

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
that be?

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
It's hard for your nervous system to calibrate that,

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
but here's a rough mode

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
of understanding the calibration.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
The existence

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
of your faithfulness

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
in your spouse is an axiomatic

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
precondition for a set of models

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
that you erect about how the world

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
will lay itself out in

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
a way that you want to. Which is to say

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
you've modeled a future

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
with this person. It's a future you want

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
and then if she's not there

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
or if her faithfulness is absent,

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
that collapses.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
But what does it collapse into?

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
It collapses into the unstructured void

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
fundamentally. And that's really hard

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
on you. If you're

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
betrayed like that, this is why betrayers

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
occupy the lowest circle of hell, right?

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
If you're betrayed like that, it's even worse.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Your future's gone

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
and that sucks because you put a lot of work

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
into it probably and you need to stabilize

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
the bad thing because it's rife with uncertainty.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
But then your present is gone

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
too because who the hell

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
is this person you're living with

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
and more to the point, what kind of moron

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
are you? And so that means

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
your model of the most

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
important person in your life

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
is gone, collapses

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
into the void and you have

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
no idea what the hell's up with you

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
either. How could you be so blind? How could you be

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
so naive? How could you be so foolish? How could

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
you be so gullible?

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
How evil is this person? How evil

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
are you? How did you

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
did you instigate

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
this in some unconscious manner? Were you

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
looking for punishment all along?

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
And then there's the whole problem of your past.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
It's like whatever you thought it was

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
it isn't. It's something completely different.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
You didn't know who you were with when you were

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
doing all the things that you thought you were doing.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
So that's a collapse

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
if you think about this game hierarchy

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
we talked about a

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
the stable marriage part of a game

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
hierarchy is way the hell up the abstraction

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
level. And so

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
it decomposes

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
into a very large subset of operations

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
and perceptions. And when you blow

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
that you basically blow out a huge

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
chunk of the personality.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
And then what shines through that is the

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
void essentially. It's terror.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
It's depression.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
And it's not just psychological

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
because you actually don't know where you are

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
who you're with anymore and so the way your body

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
responds to that is by assuming that you've been

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
drop naked into a pit of lions.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
And really your cortisol levels go way up

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
your heart rate goes it's like you're in a

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
state of chronic chronic

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
horrible stress physiological stress

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
and that will kill you it's not just psychological

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
it hurts your brain it hurts your immune

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
system makes you diabetic

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
it makes you obese it's you name

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
it it's like cortisol is bad news.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
So your body is

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
estimating the proportion of the territory

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
that you inhabit that has now become

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
uninhabitable right. And so

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
there's a that's the meaning of chaos

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
that's the meaning of chaos and it's an

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
a prior meaning and a lot of it is

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
you should be frozen in terror

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
like you're looking at the Gorgon's face

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
and the other part of it is

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
how wait a minute there's there's a

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
little treasure there too it's like the

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
dragon with the treasure maybe you can stop

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
living a false life right you can put

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
yourself back together you can start living

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
in truth you can find a relationship that's

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
actually genuine and so that's like the

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
that is precisely that the treasure

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
that the dragon guards that's why we have

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
that story by the way and that's also why

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
it's the oldest human story that

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
we know so

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
I suspected it traces itself

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
all the way back to the time 60 million

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
years ago when we were throwing branches at

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
snakes so it's all that

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
story wasn't a story then right it was

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
a pattern of behavior so

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
there's the meaning of chaos

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
and then there's the meaning of order

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
and the meaning of order is the

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
regulation of chaos just so

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
that the meaning that's useful shines

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
through and it's sort of the kind of

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
idea that Huxley had about consciousness

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
as a reducing valve I think that was Berkeley too

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
right was it Berkeley no Berkeley has a different

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
idea okay okay problem had the same idea

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
okay okay so so that's

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
two meanings meaning of order

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
stable security it can tilt

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
towards tyranny if it gets too much

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
and then there's the meaning of chaos which

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
can be horrifying at high levels of

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
abstraction and interesting at lower levels

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
and then there's one other meaning

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
which is the third class and the third

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
class is the meaning that you experience when you're

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
mediating between order and chaos

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
and that's the that's the heroic

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
meaning it's like you're you've got

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
one foot in order so maybe you've got your

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
scientific theory and you know you're out

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
on the edge of that you're on the frontier

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
the scientific frontier and you're

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
poking your beak out into the unknown

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
and as you're doing that you're seeing new

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
patterns and you're you're incorporating

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
them and you're dissolving

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
and reconstituting the whole structure

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
of the known that that is

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
order and that's that's

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
meaningful delight that's when you're doing

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
that you know you're in the right place and

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
you say well what's the meaning of life it's

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
that's we have three there's the meaning

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
of chaos look out

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
it's promise and catastrophe

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
we have the meaning of order

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
that's security and tyranny

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
and then we have the meaning of exploration

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
and that's the hero

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
myth and it's not a false

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
thing it's not self-deception it's like

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
you're out there transforming

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
chaos into order and that's

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
habitable territory for you and everyone

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
else it's like otherwise

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
it's bloody freezing to death and chewing

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
on bones with the dogs you know it's like

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
we don't want to do that

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
so it's not it's not

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
non real and we also don't know

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
how far we can push it like if all of you

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
stayed properly on the

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
border between it order and chaos

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
and we're attempting to

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
rectify in your environment everything

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
you could in a meaningful way it's like

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
God only knows how much better you could

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
make the world and like I would say

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
that's it that there's an ultimatness

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
about that and the

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
ancient Egyptians had figured this out a very

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
long time ago and it was partly for that

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
reason that they worship the God called Horus

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
who is the eye everybody knows

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
the Egyptian eye and both the Egyptians

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
and the Mesopotamians had figured out that

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
the fundamental attribute

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
of the heroic spirit

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
isn't rationality it's the

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
capacity to pay attention

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
and what's so cool about that that's the

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Cartesian issue right

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
consciousness is the capacity to pay attention

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
and attention looks beyond

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
the pyramid of the known it's the little

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
eye at the top it's looking

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
beyond and it's extending the pyramid

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
and it's transforming the pyramid when it

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
needs to be transformed and everybody

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
can stay safely and nicely it's

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
going inside of that and it stays

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
dynamic so

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
that's really the redemptive meaning

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
I think because

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
you can't be secure

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
you can't

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
you're too fragile and things are too complicated

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
so you can't put your faith in ultimate security

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
that's what totalitarians do

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
and that doesn't work it just turns

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
genocidal so what can you

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
put your faith in

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
well

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
you can put your faith and it's not even

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
faith it's an observable phenomena

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
concentrate

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
on doing things that are meaningful

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
that you can do

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
they'll announce themselves to you it's like

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
you have something's bugging you it's like fix it

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
you'll find that that's quite meaningful

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
so and that meaning redeems you

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
right in that moment because

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
if it's meaningful enough

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
you're not self-conscious

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
and anxious and hurt and suffering and

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
devastated you're like on top

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
of the game and so then you might say

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
well what if you just stayed there all the time

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
well then problem solved

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
so and you might say

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
well no that's fine say it

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
but you could try it

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
that's the thing that's so cool about this it's actually

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
this is kind of an existential argument

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
in some sense it's like

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
you can run the experiment

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
I tell my students all the time

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
watch your life

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
see what you're doing that's really

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
low quality and meaningless

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
that you could just stop doing

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
so you don't have to answer ultimate

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
questions to do that it's like

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
it's not what is truth

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
it's what is falsehood

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
and it's way easier to figure out what falsehood

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
is than truth so if you're doing

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
stupid moronic things that hurt you and your family

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
and you know it and you could stop

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
and you think you might stop

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
which is quite a set of constraints right

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
then stop

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
and then see what happens

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
and the first thing that'll happen is that things will tilt a bit

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
little less chaos

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
little more order little more freedom from you

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
for you

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
so sometimes it's the opposite

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
it's like you've got your family around the neck

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
it's like don't do anything I don't want you to do

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
it's like tyrant you know

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
so then the trick is to loosen up

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
the old tyrant a bit and get a little more chaos

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
in there and that'll optimize the meaning again

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
and so

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
you said right at the beginning of the discussion

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
that meaning wasn't a proposition

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
that's right and I would say well one form

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
of meaning is propositional that's the orderly

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
meaning

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
but the transcendent form of meaning

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
upon which even order depends

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
is the dynamic

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
meaning making

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
but that's what I meant

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
yeah I know I understand that

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
that's what I was trying to convey with this notion

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
that I think is completely

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
accessible to current cognitive science

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
of this evolving relation

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
I mean because

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
one of the key ideas in the Darwinian model

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
is you integrate

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
you have the chaos

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
you have the opening up of the variations

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
that are often due to mutation

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
and random events

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
and then you have natural selection

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
that is the ordering that's the selection process

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
and then what evolution means

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
is exactly this constant interplay

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
between them and that's what I meant

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
when I think cognition is not

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
a set of beliefs in our head

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
it's the brain's ongoing

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
evolved fittedness to the world

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
and I do think

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
I agree with you that

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
learning to

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
learn what it is to be a wise person

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
is to learn to situate yourself

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
in such a way that that relationship

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
becomes very attuned

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
it becomes very self-propellant

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
it's

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
I think

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
you went to Egyptian

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
but I think it's what Socrates meant when he said

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
wisdom begins in wonder

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
at the point about

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
when we're in a state of wonder

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
and Descartes actually

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
contrary to what a lot of people thought about Descartes

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
we're different from the other animals because we're not

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
motivated just by fear and desire

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
we're motivated also by wonder and that's what makes us unique

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
because wonder is about

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
being on that horizon of intelligibility

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
that moving horizon

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
which behind us

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
is what has been confirmed

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
but in front of us is what has not been explored

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
yes

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
so I do think that

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
that's the Taoist symbol

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
as you know I am a Taoist

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
I practice Tai Chi

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
I do challenge the idea

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
well maybe you used the term a little bit different

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
I do challenge the idea that that is

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
not a rational state

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
I think we have reduced the notion of

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
rationality too much to logical

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
argumentation so for example

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
I would say that the Buddhist notion of mindfulness

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
of reflecting

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
on how we pay attention

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
so that we make it more reliably capable

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
of putting us on that

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
so that we more reliably

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
flourish and achieve our goals

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
is as much a form

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
a cognitive style of rationality

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
as good logical argumentation is

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
precisely because by

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
being on learning how to

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
structure your attention so reliably

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
keeps you on the horizon

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
of wonder is precisely to place yourself

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
in the optimal place for

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
flourishing as a human being that constitutes

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
I think for me a fundamental kind of rationality

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
and we're again giving into the

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
romantic notion that there's this deep

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
dichotomy between you know

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
attention and experience and logic and rationality

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
we should abandon that dichotomy

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
and we should see

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
that there is as much rationality

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
right going on

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
in you know the training of mindfulness

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
as there is in the rationality

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
of training logical argumentation

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
so let look I

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
appreciate what you're saying but I want to point out

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
well let me say because

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
rationality ultimately comes from

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
ratio from rationing it's fundamentally

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
about the logistical distribution

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
of your resources for success

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
right as a human being it's not

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
primarily about

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
the logical ordering of your inferences

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
that's just one way in which we ration

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
one type of our cognitive resource

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
but it is not our most fundamental resource

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
look our behavior is

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
not ultimately and primarily

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
driven by our beliefs beliefs

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
matter they affect our behavior but there's all this

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
stuff outside or below our beliefs

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
that is driving our behavior and what

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
gets most access to that

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
is not our beliefs but what we find salient

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
what we find relevant to bring it back

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
to what I was saying before

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
yes but

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
this is why I want to make this

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
this and like

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
we're circulating around the same set of ideas

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
but there's an important point of clarification

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
here I think

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
so one of the things that you

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
probably all know is that the Catholic

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
church was very skeptical about

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
rationality right and modern

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
people are not very happy about that

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
because they think of that as anti-science

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
in a sense and the sign of

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
like a what a degenerate institution

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
and yeah yeah you can understand that

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
but they had a reason

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
and I figured out this reason when I was studying

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
um

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Paradise Lost right and the reason was this

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
so the book Paradise Lost

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
came out when

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
it's the great home by John Milton came out

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
roughly speaking when the nation states

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
in Europe were really starting to get going

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
and political ideologies were really

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
trying to starting to structure themselves

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
so they were like secular belief systems

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
and the way I read Milton is that

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
so Lucifer, Satan

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
and Milton's Paradise Lost is

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
he's Lucifer so he's the highest

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
spirit in God's heavenly hierarchy

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
so to speak and he's the bringer of light

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
right and Satan

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
like satanic arrogance is a rational

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
arrogance

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
so what does that mean exactly

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
well let's look at the Soviet Union

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
what happened in the Soviet Union with the communists

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
was that they set up a system

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
of axioms such as from each

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
according to his ability to each according

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
to his need which sound lovely

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
axiomatically true right so

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
their fundamental beliefs

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
and then they erected a rational system

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
on the basis of those axiomatic beliefs

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
that was completely coherent and

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
closed and then they worshiped

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
the ability to make that absolutely coherent

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
and not

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
to have any necessity of stepping

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
outside of it in fact if you stepped outside

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
of it with your own suffering

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
instead of taking into account the fact

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
that your suffering meant that the totalitarian

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
viewpoint was incomplete they just

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
killed you that I was a lot easier

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
than fixing the damn thing and so

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
what Milton intuited was that

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
the rational spirit which is the intelligence

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
of human beings the rational

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
and propositional based intelligence that

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
wants coherence and rigor

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
could be stretched to

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
such a degree that it became a replacement

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
for appreciation of the transcendent

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
which would be the thing outside

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
the known it just replaces that and that's

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
the satanic appropriation

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
of the highest heaven

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
in God's heavenly kingdom

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
you know and Milton's prediction

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
about that was that that turned

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
the rational mind into something that would

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
inevitably rule over hell

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
well that's what happened

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
in the 20th century now

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
I think I don't think

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
rationality is the right term exactly

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
and maybe attention isn't the right

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
term either although I think it's closer

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
I think the right term is logos

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
and logos of course

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
is the root of logic but it's also

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
the root of the idea it's a Christian

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
idea fundamentally although it's expressed

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
in many other religious beliefs

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
of the creative capacity

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
of the investigative

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
creative spirit right so

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
it's investigation and it's the

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
transformation of the consequence of the

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
investigation into fully articulated

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
representation and then it's the sharing

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
of that and so what we're doing

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
right now this is a logos conversation

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
because you're not trying

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
to impose your propositions on me

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
and I'm not trying to impose my propositions

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
on you what we're trying to do

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
is to use the structures that we both have

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
the propositional structures to dance

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
with them and out of the dance

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
to produce something that's

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
emergent and that's dynamic and that's

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
living it's the living spirit

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
actually that's living that's appropriate

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
it's it's historically

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
grounded and precisely appropriate

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
to this time and place

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
and that's the logos and so

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
that's why in complex

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
especially in complex western systems although not

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
only in them the logos

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
is the thing that's not only at the top

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
of the hierarchy of value but it's also

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
the thing that brings order out

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
of chaos at the beginning of time

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
okay I would agree with that you'd be

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
pleased to know that when I talk about this level

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
of the brain

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
and mind in my courses I use the term logos

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
to label it so

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
my students can vouch for me on that

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
and I do agree

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
but I would also point out

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
that logos is also the basis

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
of the word logistical which again is about

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
the distribution of resources

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
right right right absolutely

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
and so what I was proposing to you

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
is that

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
that a Socratic

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
I mean whatever else Socrates

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
was I mean he was open to the transcendent

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
in a very important way

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
but he was also

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
that's why he knew that

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
his not knowing was the most important thing he knew

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
but he did know but see people forget

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
that although Socrates said he didn't

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
know in that sense he said he knew

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
that he did not knew that doesn't mean that he was just ignorant

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
he meant he had what Nicholas of Cusa

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
called learned ignorance he had an inside

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
knowledge of the way in which

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
an inside awareness of the way in which

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
he was limited and

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
and faulted but

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Socrates did claim to know some things

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
he claimed to know Ta Erotica

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
which didn't mean he was some sort of

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
sexual master

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
he meant he knew what to care about

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
he knew what to find significant

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
he knew that the

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
unexamined life was not worth living

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
and he knew that to such a degree that he was willing to

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
die for that so there

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
was a kind of knowing that he talked about

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
but again it's this

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
knowing about again what to care about

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
what to find relevant what

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
you should what you should direct

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
towards and he saw argumentation

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
not as something antithetical

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
to that process

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
but as something that could deeply support it

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
the Socratic process of

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
Alancas and argumentation was not

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
antithetical to that

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
logos the Deo logos but exactly

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
meant to be constitutive

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
and enhancement enhancing

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
of that very transformation of what

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
we fundamentally care about and what we find

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
most significant and I think it's been a mistake

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
again due to the romantics

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
because most of our mistakes are due to them

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
don't forget the

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
postmodernists

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
fine

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
but what I

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
this putting on

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
one side of argumentation

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
and then putting on the other

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
the other side caring and emotion

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
I mean what's going on in cognitive science

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
right now is exactly I mean

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
neuroscientists like Demasio

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
or Montague were saying

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
this is a false dichotomy that we have

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
saddled ourselves with too long

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
you cannot be a rational being if you're not

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
also a deeply emotional being

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
and you can't be an emotional being

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
if you're not a being that is

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
in some sense doing relevance realisation

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
and rationing its resources

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
they are interdependent

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
and equally interdefining

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
and I think that again ultimately goes to the

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
fact that relevance realisation is not

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
cold calculation it is ultimately

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
also deeply right

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
effective arousing

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
it's salient and again

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
this is what we're trying to do

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
when we talk about the meaning in life

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
we're trying to find

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
those ways

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
of behaving and seeing

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
and paying attention that are rational

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
in the socratic sense

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
of affording that interrelationship

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
between argumentation

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
and caring that again

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
puts us on the horizon

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
of intelligibility puts us in that place

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
where wonder and

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
a flow of insight becomes a primary way

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
into which we try to adaptively respond

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
to a world that will always

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
be beyond our

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
complete cognitive grasp

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
put her there

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
that's good

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
so that seems

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
to be a good end to the

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
debate I think we can

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
we've got about 10 minutes so

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
it might be a good idea to

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
incorporate some of the ideas from the audience

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
I'd like to say one thing first

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
I gave

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
credit to work the idea with Leo Ferraro

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
I also want to point out that a lot of these

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
ideas have not worked out in

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
isolation

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
my good friend Chris master

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
right there is a co-author of a book

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
on a lot of these issues and he's been

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
a co-author in a true sense

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
and so I want to give him credit for some

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
of the arguments and ideas we've often worked

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
these out together

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
it seems like both of you

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
have arrived at the conclusion that

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
a sort of self-reflective

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
disposition that

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
adapts meeting structures

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
dynamically while you live

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
is how you generate proper

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
meeting structures

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
I would like to offer you something to think about

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
this is like a leap way the hell up

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
the abstraction chain

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
you've all seen Pinocchio I presume yes

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
how many have seen Pinocchio

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
you know you're watching like animated

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
drawings of some puppet

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
rescuing his father from a whale right

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
it's like what the hell are you up to by the way

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
so you might think about that for a minute

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
you go into the theater and you watch that

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
and you think oh yeah it's like there's a puppet

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
and you know he goes to an island and then he dives into the ocean

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
with a cricket and then he finds his father in a whale

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
and then a fairy changes him into a boy

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
that all makes sense

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
it's like well no actually

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
it doesn't make any sense at all and what's even

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
more interesting is that you actually don't care

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
whether it makes any sense and that you'd be annoyed

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
at anyone who would point it out

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
so one of the things I would like to point out is that

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
the fundamental theme of Pinocchio is that

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
if you don't rescue

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
your father which is order

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
by the way from the bottom of the sea

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
which is chaos then you can't

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
become a genuine human being

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
and you know we show that to

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
our kids because we know it's true but we're not

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
smart enough to understand it

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
so truly we act out

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
and represent symbolically many things

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
that we cannot articulate and that's in fact

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
what art is for but you know

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
you might walk away from this thinking

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
well you don't believe this sort of thing

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
it's like no you might think that you don't believe it

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
but if you

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
watch how you act you believe it

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
and the only thing you should ever do

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
when you're trying to figure out what someone believes

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
is watch how they act because what they say

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
about themselves is a very

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
pale reflection generally speaking

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
of the actuality that

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
they themselves are

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
you do not comprehend yourself obviously

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
because we wouldn't even need this discussion

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
but

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
well I'll leave it at that

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
I wanted to point that out because the sorts of things

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
that we're talking about are being broadcast

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
at you in many ways all the time

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
and you know the themes

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
what 20th and 21st century philosophy

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
and cognitive science are trying to do

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
when they're doing the deepest thing they can do

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
is to raise these

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
these forms

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
of knowledge that we've acquired

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
over God only knows

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
what length of time up from the depths

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
and to make them articulate

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
and to help us become real and to realize

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
ourselves and like that is the solution

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
to the problem of life in so far

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
as there is a solution

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
and it may well be a sufficient solution

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
socrates thought it was a sufficient solution

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
I agree

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
he felt that his identification

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
with the logos process

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
roughly speaking had given his life so much meaning

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
in depth that when the gods

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
offered him the chance to shuffle off the mortal coil

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
he went and had a little colloquy

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
with his conscience his daemon

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
which was basically logos

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
and it said good job old man

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
maybe it's

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
luck for you you can drink the hemlock

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
you say goodbye to all your friends

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
and all Alzheimer's and the degeneration

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
of your being

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
sayonara and that's why socrates

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
went through the trial and you know

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
we know that story and we know it for a bloody

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
reason it's like he's at the base

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
of our thought structures along with other people

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
so

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
socrates means a great deal to me

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
socrates means a great deal to me

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
socrates means a great deal to me

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
socrates means a great deal to me

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
so there seems to be

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
at least one solution to try to pursue

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
life dan dolderman poses an interesting question

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
which is how can people

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
overcome their resistance to the crushing

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
responsibility that comes with confronting

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
the meeting crisis? Well that's easy

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
try to comprehend the alternative

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
you know you're either aiming for heaven or you're

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
going to end up in hell and it'll happen while

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
you're alive I don't have any idea what'll

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
happen afterwards but like you can see

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
people in hell all the time you just have to

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
look around and so you're either on

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
the path and moving forward and upward and

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
aiming at the right thing or

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
backsliding backwards into a place

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
that is properly conceptualized as

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
eternal and punishing it's like

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
that's no problem so the way

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
you motivate yourself partly is by thinking

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
well do you really want more suffering and misery

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
in the world or do you want less

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
you know and that's basically the decision

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
that we made at the Nuremberg trials right

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
way back at the end of World War II

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
is it wrong to inflict pointless

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
pain and suffering on people for aesthetic

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
purposes

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
and the answer was well

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
yeah okay good we got hell specified

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
that's good

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
so you think well the opposite of that

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
whatever is the opposite of that well we don't know

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
that's what you're pursuing unless you were

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
like pretty fond of what happened with the Nazis

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
you know so

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
you motivate yourself by

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
running away from the most awful thing

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
there is towards the thing that's the best

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
that could possibly be

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
and it's up to you to decide what those things

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
are I mean you're an independent

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
being with all sorts of ability it's like

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
solve the problems you can solve

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
like more power to you

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
I've got my problems I'm going to solve

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
them and hopefully jointly

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
all of us we can make this

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
place that's fragmented and flawed

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
and decrepit and trouble and beauty

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
and all of that into a place that's

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
as good as we can imagine

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
anyways and we should adopt

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
the responsibility to do that because the alternative

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
you think that

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
responsibility is miserable

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
is you try your responsibility

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
just see what happens

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
so that's

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
that's my answer to that problem

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
can I have the question I'd get please

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
because I don't I think I have a

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
I'm not going to challenge what Jordan says

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
but I think I want to answer a different aspect

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
of Dan's question

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
how can people overcome the resistance to the

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
crushing responsibility that comes with confronting

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
the means

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
so I think you can make a moral argument like Jordan has

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
and I think that's valuable but

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
part of what he was

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
part of what's being implied there

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
is that

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
the question is more about

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
how to enable people

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
and what I would answer

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
I hope that's a fair thing to say

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
Dan's nodding so that's a good sign

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
I

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
would say there that and this is again

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
to fall back on to Socrates and Plato

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
and give me

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
a moment here because I'm going to say something that might be

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
a little bit at first

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
Plato talked about the fact that people

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
have to be seduced into transcendence

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
and

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
that word kind of strikes us off because we don't like

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
the notion of seduction but what he meant by that

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
is you it's like you can't it's like

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
you have to sometimes tell your kids just do

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
this and then once you've done

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
it you will know why it was

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
important to do it you have to go through

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
the transformation in order to understand

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
why the transformation is valuable to you

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
now typically people just

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
know right and so what you want to do

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
is you want you want to

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
give some form of behavior to people

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
from where

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
that's inside the box they're in

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
that they like to do inside the box

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
but has this little time bomb

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
in it and Jesus of Nazareth was

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
a master at these kinds of time bombs

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
and they were called parables you tell this story like

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
oh I know what this story is

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
but it has this little explosive thing in the center

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
of it that's a snake

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
okay well whatever

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
and the point I'm trying to make is

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
you give people

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
certain psychotechnologies certain techniques

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
and you say you know this will

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
help do this this will help

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
you do this this will help you know solve

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
you know some of your own more practical problems

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
this will make you more insightful

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
this will make you a little bit more cognitively flexible

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
but then what you've also

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
what you've actually done is you've also

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
prepared them

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
in two ways you've

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
prepared them to actually extend that

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
machinery because it has a momentum in it

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
and start to ask the question for themselves

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
and you've also enabled them

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
to act to respond to the question

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
in a more challenging form

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
and then if you can keep doing that

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
with them in a kind of Socratic dance

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
you can you can draw

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
and this is what was meant by the seduction metaphor

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
you can draw people into

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
a very deep kind of responsibility

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
without having them at any point

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
confront a kind of crushing

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
clash and I mean in that sense

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
and I don't mean this in a patronizing sense

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
it is very much like good parenting

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
right yourself

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
yes of yourself whoever you're trying to help

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
confront

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
the meaning crisis

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
without as Dan is saying

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
sort of just dropping this nightmare on them

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
so that's how I would try

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
I want to elaborate on that a little bit

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
because you know John brought up

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
this other idea about parables

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
and so I want to tell you about a meta parable

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
because the parables that Christ

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
laid out were embedded

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
in a meta parable

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
and the meta parable

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
what expanded itself

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
over 2000 years into Christianity

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
essentially and so although it has its roots

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
far before Christianity emerged

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
so John said

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
you know you throw someone a little box

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
and you say transform within it

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
it's like okay fine so I would say the way you do that

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
is like we said this earlier

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
pick a problem that bugs you

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
that's why Jiminy Cricket is an insect by the way

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
pick a problem that bugs you

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
that you could solve

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
and solve it

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
now what Piaget would say

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
that in order to do that

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
you're going to have to take some of the presuppositions

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
that you're using locally in that box

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
let them die

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
that's a kind of sacrifice

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
and then

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
generate a little local chaos

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
and then pop up a new solution

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
and so that's a small death and rebirth

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
and so the reason that the parables

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
are tested inside the story of death and rebirth

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
is because the idea

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
is that the way that you get to the kingdom of heaven

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
so to speak

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
is to allow yourself to die

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
and be reborn and so you should have faith

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
in the part of yourself that can undergo

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
a disilutive process

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
in preparation

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
for a rebirth and that can happen

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
at multiple levels of analysis

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
micro levels which is where you should start

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
man start at the micro levels

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
fix what's at hand

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
and then if you get good at that

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
you can start moving up the abstraction chain

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
and you know if you get all the way to the top

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
which you won't because you can't

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
then the deaths and rebirths are very very

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
profound and significant

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
well that's a metaphor in many ways

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
and I don't know how far it extends

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
I mean it extends in long ways

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
but that is part of what

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
that drama and it is a drama

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
is trying to teach us about ourselves

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
we formulated the drama

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
to tell us who we are

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
you know and so

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
I like that

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
I really like that

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
you just said about the meta parable

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
and Christ exemplifying a parable

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
as a background thing

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
to ground his spoken parables

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
that's quite brilliant well done

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
thank you it only took me like 35 years

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
to think of it

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
well better you than me because I benefit from that

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
I mean that's great

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
I mean that's really good that's very good

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
I think

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
and I think

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
you're noticing about disillusion

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
affording you know this is

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
you know this is dynamical systems theory

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
it's also what the shaman do

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
yes of course

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
and I was also saying

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
that I think it's prevalent also

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
in the platonic metaphor

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
of people who are attracted

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
in the cave and they've been trapped

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
so that they're always looking at the shadows

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
and hearing the echoes and they have to make their way out

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
and they make their way a little bit

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
they make their eyes accommodate

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
and then that allows them to go a little bit farther

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
and then that blinds them

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
and then their eyes accommodate

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
and then that affords them to go a little bit farther

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
and you do the ascension

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
you do the anagogy out towards

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
where you're in the real world

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
looking at the sun

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
and I think that's the way you do it with people

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
well and then once you've looked at the sun

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
you take the light home and you distribute it

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
to people who are in the dark

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
well the problem as Plato said is when you go back down

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
day two if you go back

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
I mean Plato said it first way before man for man

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
you're blinded by the light

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
but if you go back too soon

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
they're going to kill you

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
like they kill Socrates

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
so then there's just as much

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
problem

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
of responsibility

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
on the teacher

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
as there is on the people being taught

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
they can suffer also a kind of catastrophic

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
event

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
if they come back down from the sun

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
I'm not putting myself in that place of enlightenment

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
but you know what I'm trying to say

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
I'm pretty much done

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
that's our time

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
good work

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
congratulations
