1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
What does the word meaning denote in the expression meaning of life?

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Is it a directive, a feeling, or something else entirely?

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Well, I think it's not a straightforward manner to discuss the meaning of life, right?

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Because it's pretty clear that there are multiple meanings,

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and those meanings are associated with different events and situations.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I think you can still intelligently address the issue of the meaning of life,

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
because meanings tend to arrange themselves into a hierarchy of value and relevance,

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and they have to do that because otherwise there's nothing but, as William James suggested,

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
sort of a blooming and buzzing confusion.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So the issue is multiple meanings in a unified, integrated framework.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Meaning is partly an impetus for action.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's very important to remember that human beings are active and living creatures,

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and that one of our primary problems, in fact, perhaps our primary problem,

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
is how to act in the world.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
But that also involves other questions like how to perceive, how to prepare for action,

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
how to plan for action in the future.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And so all of those questions are associated with meaning.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
For me, meaning is the abstract impetus towards action, fundamentally.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And it's an important thing to give some consideration to,

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
because part of the Western intellectual tradition tends to abstract rationality

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
or consciousness from embodiment, and it's very much the case that we are embodied creatures.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The idea that our brain is in our head and that our mind is in our brain,

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:57,000
it's a useful idea for certain purposes, but it obscures much while shedding light on other things.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So meaning is tightly associated with action, with the abstraction of action,

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
but then also with the construction of the perceptual frameworks and emotional responses

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
that are necessary to conceive of the world in a manner that allows you to act in it.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So one of the things we know, for example, is that when you walk into a room like this

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
and you see the furniture of the landscape arrayed in front of you,

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
that one of the things that you directly perceive is actually the meaning of that furniture.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And you might think that you see the object and infer the meaning,

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
and that's what you would think if you were a traditional Western rationalist or even a materialist,

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
but it actually seems to be the case that when you walk into a room like this,

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
the room tells you what to do at a level that's below conscious realization,

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and it's partly because, well, you know exactly what chairs are for.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You might ask yourself, for example, what is a chair?

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's a complicated question because it could be a beanbag and it could be a stump,

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
but fundamentally a chair is something to sit in,

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
and when you see a chair, the chair tells you directly as a perceptual consequence that you sit in it,

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
and that's the meaning of the chair.

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And so you can't understand meaning in that manner without considering meaning in relationship to embodiment.

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And so meaning is really how we propel ourselves through the world

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
and how we organize ourselves and arrange to propel ourselves through the world

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,000
in a manner that's productive, relatively free of suffering, even though that's a meaning,

44
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and sustainable across many situations and contexts.

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So that's a rough framework for the initiation of the discussion.

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
For me, I think the first thing I would say is that word meaning is being used as a metaphor.

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
We're taking basically a term from language, a sentence is meaningful,

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
and we're using it metaphorically to try to denote something that is probably pre-linguistic,

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
although it shows up in our language.

50
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
A sentence is meaningful in that it does something to information

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
in such a way that we get a fundamental connection between ourselves and the world.

52
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And I think that's, for me, what is fundamentally going on when we talk about meaning.

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
We're talking about the fact that there's a fundamental process of selection

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
that the brain, the embodied brain, which I agree with you is a very important thing

55
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
to constantly remind ourselves of, has to face.

56
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
There's way too much information available at all times,

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,000
and of all of that information, only some of it is going to be useful or helpful to an organism.

58
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And somehow that information has to be found.

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It has to be found in a very reliable manner.

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It has to be transformed into a form that is relevant to this body in this world,

61
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:57,000
such that I can frame problems, solve problems, achieve my goals.

62
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And that process of zeroing in on relevant information, what I call relevance realization,

63
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:11,000
means that we are fundamentally thrown into a atmospheric kind of relationship to the world.

64
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
There's a salience landscape constantly being projected at all times of how things stand out to you,

65
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
what gathers your attention, what arouses your metabolic resources or dampens them,

66
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
what creates certain motivational and affective states.

67
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Because this relevance realization process is not a cold calculation, like a computer.

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's instead a deep involvement between the organism and its world.

69
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And that involvement has, as Jordan says, it's often and most prominently going on below consciousness,

70
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
and it's an ongoing, evolving process.

71
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I mean, one minute something is salient.

72
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Look, that became salient to you, now it's not salient anymore.

73
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So that process is constantly evolving.

74
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And so we shouldn't think of meaning as a static thing,

75
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
but this ongoing process by which the organism is constantly fitting itself to the world

76
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
and having the world fitted to it so that its actions can be undertaken in a fluent manner.

77
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Now the thing that I think is very important about this,

78
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
meaning making process, or as I prefer to call it, relevance realization,

79
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
because I think meaning is standing in as a metaphor for that,

80
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,000
is that this process is, it's below our consciousness, it's below our rationality,

81
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
it's below our language use, it's below our deliberative reasoning,

82
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
precisely because it's constitutive or presupposed by all those processes.

83
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Until you do relevance realization, you can't use a language.

84
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Until you do relevance realization, you can't form representations.

85
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Until you do relevance realization, you can't even form your own autobiographical identity.

86
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The world as a place that has categories and you as a cognitive agent with a sense of identity in it,

87
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
both co-spring from this relevance realization.

88
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It is a deep binding of you and the world at a fundamental level.

89
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And that's why when it's threatened in any fashion,

90
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
human beings will experience a deep kind of trauma, absurdity, horror, a deep kind of anxiety.

91
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And so when I think people are talking about meaning in life,

92
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
what they're trying to gesture towards is they have structures in place

93
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
that maintain and enhance that relevance realization such that two things are possible.

94
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
They can reliably keep at bay absurdity and horror,

95
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
and they can reliably afford the ongoing evolution, the growth of that relevance realization

96
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
so that they can find some kind of fulfillment in that identity

97
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
that they are cultivating for themselves as a cognitive agent

98
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
and the world into which they are fitted.

99
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And so I think the degree to which people are talking about meaning in life

100
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
is the degree to which they're talking about those kinds of structures

101
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
that affect that co-creation out of relevance realization of cognitive agency

102
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
and a world in which cognitive agents can solve problems in an intelligible manner.

103
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
We should also maybe decide if we agree on something.

104
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
We're going to agree on many things, I suppose.

105
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And a lot of a discussion like this is often terminological

106
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
and it's partly going to be the case between John and I

107
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
because his intellectual background is different than mine,

108
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
although it overlaps in some important ways.

109
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And so partly what I'm hoping to do with the discussion tonight

110
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
is to make sure that we actually understand each other.

111
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
This is definitely not a debate in which one of us is going to win.

112
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
What we're hoping to do is to have the kind of conversation

113
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
that allows for the scaffolding and the further development of ideas,

114
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
which is really what an intellectual conversation is.

115
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So I want to offer you a couple of propositions

116
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
and tell me what you think about them.

117
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
The first thing is that I don't believe that the question

118
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
does life have meaning is actually a reasonable question.

119
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I don't think it's properly formulated.

120
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And the reason I believe that is because

121
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
that isn't really what people want to know when they ask that question.

122
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Life has lots of meanings.

123
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
The Buddhists would say that life is suffering.

124
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And you know, we might not think about suffering as meaning,

125
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
but fundamentally it's anxiety and pain

126
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
and with some disgust thrown in there maybe for good measure.

127
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And those are meanings.

128
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And even if you're nihilistic and you're not oriented towards

129
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
a belief in some sort of ultimate meaning structure,

130
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
that doesn't mean you can escape from the meaning of life.

131
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
What it does mean is that the meaning of your life is misery,

132
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
suffering, anxiety, and a real decrement and quality.

133
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So we're trapped inside the question of the meaning of life.

134
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
There's no getting outside of it.

135
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You can say there's no ultimate meaning,

136
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
but then you have to define ultimate.

137
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And then the other thing that I thought...

138
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So let me just make sure I got the first proposition.

139
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
The first proposition is the question,

140
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I want to make sure I got your wording right,

141
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
does life have a meaning as opposed?

142
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I just want to store that.

143
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I can either respond or wait until you put your second question out.

144
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yeah, yeah.

145
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I just don't want to lose the first question.

146
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The other thing that might be useful, clarifying,

147
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I understand what you mean by relevance realization.

148
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I have a formulation of it in my own language,

149
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
so I'm going to make a couple of comments on that as well,

150
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
and you can tell me if you agree or disagree on that.

151
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So one of the things that's quite...

152
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
One of the ways that you can approach the idea of meaning

153
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
is by making a separate assumption

154
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
about what the fundamental structures in the world are.

155
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I mean, materialists and empiricists

156
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
tend to believe that the fundamental structures are,

157
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
we'll say, atomic particles,

158
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
even though we know we can go higher resolution than that.

159
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
There's atomic particles and there's this space

160
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
in which they're distributed,

161
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
and what that means is that the combination of quantum particles,

162
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
quantized particles plus space,

163
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
allows for the array of physical entities in patterns.

164
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Like music is a pattern,

165
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
and there seems to me that there's something profoundly similar

166
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
about patterns and information,

167
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
and it seems to me that what we experience as meaning

168
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
is something like our interaction with information.

169
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Now, I just want to say one more thing about that.

170
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
The problem with information in some sense

171
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
is that there's too much of it.

172
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So one of the things you could say about life's meaning

173
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
is that there's absolutely way too much of it.

174
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You can certainly experience that

175
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
if you ever have an experience of awe,

176
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
or even of overwhelming absurdity.

177
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Those are both quasi-religious experiences.

178
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So relevance realization is actually, as far as I can tell,

179
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
it's the limitation of what's essentially

180
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
an close to infinite field of information

181
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
that's so rich that it can't be exhausted

182
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
into a narrower form that's focal and useful

183
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
for this particular time and this particular place

184
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
for this particular set of activities.

185
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
So it's a narrowing process.

186
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Yeah, okay, so I'll respond to the second thing first

187
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
because that will actually help me to respond

188
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
to your first question about the posing of the question.

189
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Yeah, I think that's a good way of putting it.

190
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Although I would want to emphasize

191
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
that I don't think that process is just a selection process,

192
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
it's an important transformation process

193
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
because we do something to the information,

194
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
and you made reference to this in the embodiment.

195
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It's not just that we have sort of passively taken in the information

196
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
or selected it from the environment.

197
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
We make the pieces, like you said, we find patterns.

198
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It's how the pieces are relevant to each other,

199
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
how they're relevant to us.

200
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Again, and I'm trying to emphasize this,

201
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
not just as some sort of cold calculation

202
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
about that information, but a way in which...

203
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I mean, we say it like we make sense.

204
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's constitutive of our cognitive agency.

205
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Just like our bodies take in matter,

206
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
but they don't just select the matter,

207
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
they transform it and restructure it,

208
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
so we have the ability to operate in the world.

209
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Our minds don't just select the information,

210
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
they take in it, they transform it and structure it,

211
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
so analogous to our bodies,

212
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
we gain skills and abilities to interact with that world

213
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
from which that information was selected.

214
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
That's why I think people love to watch bands improvise,

215
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
because really what they're doing,

216
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
especially if they're doing it collectively,

217
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
is they're engaging in a collective process

218
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
of the spontaneous transmutation of patterns.

219
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And I think the reason that people find that so deeply meaningful

220
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
is because it is representation,

221
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
like an ongoing abstract artistic representation.

222
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I think it's an exemplification of what we do in the world.

223
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
That's right. I think one of the reasons why we like art

224
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
is we play with the variance...

225
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
We're playing in the Piagetian sense of playing,

226
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
in the sense of developing our skills.

227
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
We play with the relevance realization machinery for its own sake.

228
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
But that allows me to go back to your...

229
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I think asking for the meaning of life,

230
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
it carries with it sort of...

231
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
even saying the meaning in life,

232
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
it carries with it the presupposition that meaning is sort of there to be found,

233
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
and it immediately steers us away from this ongoing process

234
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
in which we're taking in information,

235
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
transforming it, structuring it,

236
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
altering ourselves, fitting to a world

237
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
that is then also itself, restructuring itself, changing itself.

238
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
And so there's this ongoing, evolving relationship.

239
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
So one of the reasons why I don't like the question,

240
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
the meaning of life, is it proposes a ready-made answer to be found.

241
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It presupposes a static thing to be discovered,

242
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
or even a static relation to be realized.

243
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And it also carries with it the idea that...

244
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's like, like you said,

245
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
it's like there is an answer to a question that has been posed,

246
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
when I don't think the issue facing us is a riddle

247
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
or a question in that sense that some proposition will satisfy.

248
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I don't think there's anything that...

249
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm sorry, this will sound incredibly pretentious,

250
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
but I'm being asked about, I think.

251
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I don't think there's anything...

252
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm trying to make him sound pretentious.

253
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I don't think there's a proposition that anybody can say to you

254
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
that will render your life meaningful.

255
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I mean, you might do things with that proposition

256
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
that might fit you better to the world

257
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
so that horror becomes less prevalent

258
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
and flourishing becomes more prominent.

259
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
But to think that the answer is in the proposition

260
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
is to misunderstand the role of propositions in our cognition.

261
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
The propositional level is very high up

262
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
and sits on many recursive levels of relevance realization

263
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
that only at their very tip produce this kind of propositional processing.

264
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
The meaning is much more our knowing how to interact with the world,

265
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
knowing how to fit my hand to this glass is part of that process.

266
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
And that's not based on sort of just...

267
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's not primarily based on my beliefs about the glass.

268
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It's based on a much more complex dynamical system

269
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
by which my body, my perception, the glass, the atmosphere

270
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
are fitting together so that I can grasp the glass.

271
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
So one of the things that I found interesting,

272
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I learned this, I think, mostly from Gibson,

273
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
who wrote a book called...

274
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
One of the things Gibson presupposes,

275
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
he has a very interesting way of looking at the world

276
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
and it's tied deeply into our fundamental presuppositions

277
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
about the structure of reality

278
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
because one of the big issues about meaning in some sense

279
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
is whether it's fundamentally constitutive of reality

280
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
or if it's what would you call an emergent property

281
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
of something more fundamental.

282
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Now the answer to that question in part is exactly what do you mean by reality

283
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
and also the question is also what do you mean by truth

284
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
and this isn't Pontius Pilate's question,

285
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
it's a whole different kind of question.

286
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Now the modern neuroscientists in some sense following Gibson

287
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
make the claim that when you look at a glass like that

288
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
that what happens in your brain is that the pattern of the glass

289
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
maps itself onto the pattern of your gripping hand

290
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
and that maps itself onto the pattern of pouring and drinking

291
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
and that a lot of that happens potentially before or alongside

292
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
your conscious perception of the glass as an object.

293
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
So we know for example that there are people who claim to be blind

294
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
who can still map objects onto their body.

295
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
So that's called blind sight.

296
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
So developing that idea, it's appeared to me

297
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
that there's good evidence that what we see when we look at the world is meaning.

298
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
We don't see objects and infer meaning, we see meaning and we infer objects

299
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
and so then the question is well is the meaning real

300
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
and then that answer to that is well what do you mean by real

301
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
and it'll only take me a minute to lay this out.

302
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
This starts to depend on whether you're a Darwinian or a Newtonian.

303
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
If you're a Newtonian then the real thing is the material object

304
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
and we also know that Newton in some important ways was wrong

305
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
but if you're a Darwinian and you almost have to be a Darwinian

306
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I really don't see any escape from it unless you don't know what you're talking about fundamentally.

307
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:12,000
There's reasons for that is that the thing that determines whether or not

308
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,000
you're going to survive and propagate which is by the way the best solution

309
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
you can possibly answer to the problem of life if you're a biological organism

310
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
and you have a Darwinian philosophy, the question you're trying to answer is

311
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
what is the appropriate meaning to perceive in each environment

312
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
because that determines your action and your action

313
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
the consequences of your action determines whether you survive and propagate

314
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
and so if you take the question of meaning from a Darwinian perspective

315
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
you can actually say as far as I can tell that the fundamental constituent elements

316
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
at least of experience and perhaps of reality itself

317
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
are the meanings that you perceive before you infer the object.

318
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Now that's a pretty radical ontological claim and I've never heard anyone else actually make it

319
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
except for maybe the pragmatists.

320
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's a variant of pragmatic philosophy but I've tried to wrap my head around that argument

321
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
and see if I can destroy it but I can't so I'm just wondering what you think about that.

322
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I have a lot to think about that and I have a lot to say about it.

323
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,000
First of all, before I get into the Darwinian Newtonian thing

324
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
which I've seen you do a couple of times before and I've always found it very interesting.

325
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
It's one of my little tricks.

326
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
You belittle it, it's one of your good tricks. I mean it's a very good one.

327
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
It's a very good point.

328
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
First of all the question, I do think that fittedness to the world does create

329
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I think Plato had a fantastic insight that above and beyond any particular desire we have

330
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
we have a desire for what we desire to be real in some sense.

331
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
One of the ways to rob meaning from your life is to suddenly realize

332
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
that a bunch of things, a bunch of the things you've desired

333
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
or the bunch of the things that you thought made you happy are illusory in some sense.

334
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
In fact people will do a bizarre thing and I do this every time in a class.

335
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I'll ask how many of you are in really satisfying, deeply satisfying personal relationships

336
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
and surprisingly many people put up their hands.

337
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Those are the self-deceptive ones.

338
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And then I do the following.

339
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I say how many of you would want to know if your partner was cheating on you

340
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
such that it would destroy the relationship

341
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
and almost all of them put their hands back up again.

342
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:36,000
They would rather have the truth than have all of that other stuff that they find so good be illusory.

343
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
And I think that was one of Plato's profound insights.

344
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
This connectedness to reality is a fundamental drive in us.

345
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
You know John, when you're asking that you're basically asking people whether or not

346
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
if they were in a perfect garden they'd be willing to check out the snake.

347
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Yes, right.

348
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
And the answer of course we all know is that well of course people will check out the snake

349
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
because that's just what we're like.

350
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
But I do think there's something important to that.

351
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I think ultimately the platonic orientation towards truth

352
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
is grounded in that notion of a deeper drive towards real.

353
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I think asking the question about whether or not meaning is real

354
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
part of it I want to challenge the presupposition behind the question first

355
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
because the presupposition behind that is that only things are real

356
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
and that relationships, relations between things aren't real.

357
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
And I think it is very, so it might strike people as odd for me to say

358
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
yes of course I think relevance is real

359
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I don't think it's part, and this is where I might differ with you

360
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
but I think we'll have to negotiate it.

361
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I don't think it's part of the physical fabric of the universe

362
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
nor do I think it is just a subjective illusion on our head.

363
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
It is a real relation between us and the environment.

364
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Just like evolution is a real relation between an organism and its environment.

365
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It's not a property of the environment.

366
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It's not a property of the organism.

367
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It's a real relation between them that explains both the history of the organism

368
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
and the history of the environment.

369
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
So that would be a lovely thing to see if we can get clear

370
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
because that's a very profound argument, like a profound debate.

371
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
There are Heideggerians who took opposite positions on that.

372
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Yes, I'm aware of that.

373
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
And some of them were psychologists, right?

374
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
And so I'm just going to outline it for the audience

375
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
and to make sure we're thinking about it the same way.

376
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
One stance is that meaning, so to speak,

377
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
is a consequence of the operation of these elaborate patterns of construction

378
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
in your mind and that you're imposing that on the world.

379
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
So it's like a structure issue.

380
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Yeah, that's a romantic issue with meaning.

381
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
And then the other one is that meaning is in the world, so to speak,

382
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
and that what you do with the structures in your head is limited and narrow it.

383
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
And I think in some weird way both of those things are true.

384
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
But here's something that I've been thinking about for a long time

385
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
and I want you to maybe help me figure out a bit more.

386
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
So I'm going to go at this from two perspectives.

387
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
So back in the late 1800s,

388
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Nietzsche basically formalized a set of observations

389
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
about what he thought was happening in Western society

390
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
and then the world at large, right?

391
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
And the basic argument was something like this,

392
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
was that the metaphysical presuppositions of religious systems

393
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
and the metaphysical presuppositions of scientific systems were not in sync.

394
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
They weren't of the same paradigm.

395
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
And that as Western scientific investigation had preceded,

396
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,000
it became obvious that either the truths of religion weren't true

397
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
or at least that they weren't of the type that science recognized as truth.

398
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
And Nietzsche basically described that as the death of God.

399
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
And so he said that three things would happen in the aftermath of that.

400
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
He was a prophet. He was like an Old Testament prophet.

401
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:55,000
He said that totalitarianism would become unbelievably attractive to people,

402
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
especially in its hyper-socialist variants like communism,

403
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
and that millions of people would die in the 20th century as a consequence of that

404
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
and that it would be a necessary battle.

405
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
And he said that like 40 years before the Russian Revolution

406
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
and so like, yeah, go Nietzsche.

407
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
You try to predict the future like five years ahead, see how far you get.

408
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:21,000
And then the other thing he said would be that nihilism would rise to pathological proportions

409
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
because it's basically the polar opposite of totalitarianism, right?

410
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
You wipe out the religious structures.

411
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
People move towards ideology to reattain that certainty,

412
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
but it's rigid and deadly, or they fall off into chaos itself.

413
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Okay, then Nietzsche made one more proposition which was that

414
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
the only solution to that would be for human beings to transform themselves

415
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
into meaning-creating creatures.

416
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
And so what Nietzsche basically did, and I think this was a mistake in his metaphysics,

417
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
was that he assumed that the objective description of reality was correct,

418
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
that reality in and of itself was dead and meaningless,

419
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
but that human beings could interact with that in such a way

420
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
as a consequence of their individual choices to make that richly meaningful.

421
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
And that we needed to do that because the alternatives would be nihilism or totalitarianism.

422
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
One more comment on that.

423
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
So, you know, Jung was a student of Nietzsche, a profound student,

424
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
and he was actually trying to solve the problem that Nietzsche put forward,

425
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
which was, oh, wow, we got nihilism on the one hand

426
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
and we got totalitarianism on the other hand,

427
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
and, you know, those don't really seem to be very good solutions

428
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
since millions of people die because of one

429
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
and millions of people commit suicide because of the other.

430
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
It's like those are suboptimal solutions in all likelihood.

431
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:45,000
So, but Jung in some sense took issue with Nietzsche's fundamental proposition,

432
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
which was that human beings were meaning creating creatures.

433
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
And I actually think it's the most profound critique of Nietzsche

434
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
because what Jung pointed out, this is something that just blew me away when I first understood it,

435
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
and it has to do with your relevance realization issue in a deadly way.

436
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
It's like, imagine the things that attract your attention and your interest.

437
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Well, okay, so then you might think,

438
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
well, is that a voluntary process or an involuntary process?

439
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
And to answer that, you can think about it.

440
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
It's like you're working on some dismally wretched, boring,

441
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
and stultifying thing at work or as a student,

442
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
and your attention is like fragmented everywhere.

443
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
You think about the dust bunnies under your bed

444
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
and that maybe the dishes need to be done

445
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
or maybe the rug needs to be walked

446
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
and the rug needs to be vacuumed

447
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
and it's like bloody well anything other than that boring task.

448
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Even though you know you have to do it in order to say pass a course

449
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
or pass an exam or get the assignment done,

450
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
you can't control your damn brain.

451
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
It's wandering everywhere.

452
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And then, so the weird thing about that

453
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
is that you cannot voluntarily control your relevance realization.

454
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
And then you have the contrary problem,

455
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,000
which is that there's a YouTube video about kittens

456
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
and it's like bang man, you're focused on that.

457
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
And so one of the things you might ask

458
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
is just who the hell is in control of this relevance realization?

459
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
And that was Jung's question.

460
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
It was like, well where Nietzsche fell apart,

461
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Nietzsche fell apart was that he assumed that human beings

462
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
were primarily meaning making creatures.

463
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
But then if you try it, it's like,

464
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
hey, I'm going to find it really meaningful to go to the gym

465
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
three times a week next week for half an hour

466
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
and I'm going to push myself right to my limits.

467
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
It's like I have every reason for doing it.

468
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I know why I should do it,

469
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
but I'd rather sit on the couch in my underwear and eat cheetes.

470
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Cheetos.

471
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
So you've got to ask yourself, man, who's in charge.

472
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
And one of the things that the psychodynamic theorists were so damn good at

473
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
was pointing out that, well, you think it's you, but it's not.

474
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
And so then that begs the question.

475
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
It's like, where's the meaning coming from and who is in charge?

476
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
And so I know that's questions that you're trying to answer,

477
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
but it doesn't exactly seem to me that we're overlaying that on the world

478
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
or that if we are, we don't have much voluntary control over that.

479
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Okay, well, I don't think we're overlaying it on the world

480
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
and that's what I meant by a real relation

481
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
and I was comparing it to evolution.

482
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I think to talk about us being meaning makers in the Nietzschean sense

483
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
is to fall prey to the romantic illusion

484
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
that the world is a blank slate.

485
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I mean, you have the blank slate of the enlightenment

486
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
in which reason the world writes on us

487
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
and then you have the blank slate of the romantics

488
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
in which the world is a blank slate,

489
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
like the unpainted canvas that we...

490
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
And Nietzsche constantly used the artistic metaphor

491
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
and even created the idea of a lifestyle

492
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
as if our lives are works of art

493
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
because the world is just an empty canvas upon which we project our meaning.

494
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Well, and there's totalitarian presuppositions in there too

495
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
because one of the presuppositions of totalitarian ideologues

496
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
is that there is no such thing as human nature

497
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
and that people can be constructed in any way possible.

498
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Exactly, and that's why existentialism comes out of Nietzsche

499
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
because existentialism posits that our essence and our nature

500
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
is completely the property of our own self-definition.

501
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
So what I'm actually doing is I'm rejecting both of those blank slates.

502
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I'm saying the world is neither a blank slate

503
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
that we romantically project upon

504
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
nor is the mind a blank slate that experience just empirically draws upon.

505
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
What I'm proposing instead is a dynamic interaction between the two

506
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:43,000
and to say that who's in charge is kind of an odd question

507
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
but before I answer that,

508
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I want to take a little bit of exception on your interpretation of Nietzsche

509
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
because I think it might help

510
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
and it also might get us back to the Newton-Darwin thing

511
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
which I promise to get back to too.

512
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I mean, Nietzsche lays, and again, Heidegger followed up on this,

513
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
he actually lays the history of nihilism much further back.

514
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
He says that the history of nihilism starts with Plato

515
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
and that Christianity is just Plato for the masses

516
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
because my interpretation of Nietzsche is that the main cause of nihilism

517
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
goes back to the Acts of Revolution.

518
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
It's the creation of the two-world model

519
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
and the idea is that this world gets its meaning, its value,

520
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
it has an instrumental value in getting us to some other world,

521
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
to some world in which we will finally find the fulfillment

522
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
and the protection from horror that we don't find in this world,

523
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
a heaven, right?

524
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
And then what happens, right?

525
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
It wasn't just the clash between the scientific and the religious worldview.

526
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,000
What happens is that the scientific worldview calls the second world,

527
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
the heavenly world, into question.

528
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,000
But what happened is we have millennia of Christianity and Platonism

529
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,000
tutoring us to believe that this world is not meaningful in itself

530
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
because it's only valuable insofar as we get to this heaven.

531
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
And when science says, I imagine that there is no heaven,

532
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
or John Lennon, right?

533
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Then we're left.

534
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
My favorite beatle.

535
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
We're left, right?

536
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
That really dates me, doesn't it?

537
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Then we're left with this world that we've been tutored for millennia,

538
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
has no value in it.

539
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
And so I think what Nietzsche was trying to do,

540
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I agree with you, there's a romantic streak in Nietzsche

541
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
and like I said, I reject that romantic streak

542
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
that the world is a blank slate upon which we paint our lifestyles.

543
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
That is ridiculously hubristic in nature.

544
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
But there was another thing Nietzsche was trying to do,

545
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
and so I think there's, I mean Nietzsche has multiple voices,

546
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
it has anything.

547
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
So in addition to the romantic project,

548
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
which I often find really bombastic,

549
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
there is another project that he called trying to revalue the earth,

550
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,000
which was to try to see the earth as a place in which we could be at home.

551
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
On its own terms, for its own sake.

552
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
So that was more Heidegger, I think.

553
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,000
No, no, Heidegger talks about learning how to revalue the earth

554
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
and loving the earth as a repeated theme throughout Nietzsche's work,

555
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
and loving the body is a repeated theme in Nietzsche's work.

556
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Because he thought that just like we had the two worlds,

557
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
we had the two parts of us, we had the body,

558
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
but the body only existed in service of the soul,

559
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
and the body therefore has no inherent value,

560
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
because its only job is to get the soul to the only place where it has real meaning,

561
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
which is heaven.

562
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
And then his point was, if we lose the heaven and if we lose the idea of the soul,

563
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
we have to get back to revaluing the body, revaluing the earth.

564
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
And what I'm proposing in this sort of evolutionary model of relevance realisation

565
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
is exactly that the body and the earth co-create this real relation

566
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
that fundamentally homes us and fits us into the world.

567
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
And that the meaning crisis and therefore, it's not just...

568
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I mean, yes, I agree, there are definitely historical forces for it

569
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,000
and the rise of science and the demise of the wisdom traditions and the religious traditions.

570
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
But I think the meaning crisis is in some sense also a perennial problem.

571
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
You see it cross-culturally, you see it cross-historically,

572
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
because people can always get trapped between these two kinds of perspectives

573
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
they can have on themselves.

574
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
They can always fall prey to these kinds of two world models.

575
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And so I think the thing I want to say is

576
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
part of what's going on right now in the meaning crisis in the West

577
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
is we're trying to...

578
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
And this is the way Nietzsche, I think, was prescient, as you said.

579
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
He was a prophet.

580
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
By the way, he predicted four things.

581
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
He predicted that he would be famous eventually.

582
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Although that he would basically starve to death in the meantime.

583
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Right, but why I am so great was one of his...

584
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Timing is everything.

585
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Yeah, exactly.

586
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,000
And so what he was prescient about is the fact that...

587
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I mean, basically since the actual age in 800 BCE and onward,

588
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
we've had this two-world model.

589
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
And now we're going through a radical re-embedding.

590
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
And for a lot of people, that's caused a kind of nihilism.

591
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
But one of the things I would throw out to you is that

592
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
there's a possibility in an emerging cognitive science,

593
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
and a cognitive science in which embodiment and embeddiment

594
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
are becoming central for appropriating that re-embedding process

595
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,000
as a way of discovering, rediscovering how we can be at home,

596
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
fundamentally at home in the world,

597
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
and how the earth and our bodies co-create that home

598
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
in a way that, again, protects us from horror

599
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
and allows us to flourish as cognitive agents.

600
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
So you did something I think is lovely,

601
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
and I don't think that it's people who aren't quite deeply educated can do,

602
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
is you pushed the problem quite a bit farther back in time.

603
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
So I want to one-up you on that.

604
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Okay.

605
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
So I do think it's a deeper problem than Nietzsche pointed out.

606
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
He pointed out the more articulated modern end of it.

607
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
And we see that as the conflict, say, between science and religion.

608
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
But if you can push these sorts of things back,

609
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I think to the dawn of self-consciousness itself.

610
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
And one of the reasons that I've been so obsessed with the book of Genesis

611
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:26,000
is because I read Genesis as a dramatic representation

612
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
of the coming to self-consciousness of mankind.

613
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Because what happens with Adam and Eve when they eat the fruit

614
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
that the snake delivers to them,

615
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
which is very interesting sort of phenomena from an evolutionary perspective,

616
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
which I can talk about later,

617
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
what happens to Adam and Eve is very, very specific.

618
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I mean, the first thing that happens...

619
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I'm sorry, I might get the order wrong.

620
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
But the first thing that happens is that they realize

621
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
their eyes are opened and they're like gods

622
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
knowing the difference between good and evil.

623
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
And that's very interesting,

624
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
because it associates the development of self-consciousness

625
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
and the rise of articulated and complicated morality.

626
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
And so I've thought about that for a long time.

627
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
It's like, okay, you realize you're naked.

628
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
What does that mean?

629
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Well, you don't want to be naked up here on the stage,

630
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
if you're speaking properly to the audience you are.

631
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
But maybe you don't want that.

632
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Okay, well, why?

633
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Why don't you want to be up here naked on the stage?

634
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
It's everyone's nightmare, right?

635
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Well, you know, you're kind of flawed and saggy,

636
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
and there's parts of you that are not that beautiful,

637
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
even if you happen to be a supermodel.

638
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
And you're not as bright as you could be,

639
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
and your hair might be going a little bit,

640
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
and your teeth aren't that great,

641
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
and you're not as smart as you could be,

642
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
and you've got a lot of flaws,

643
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
plus you're going to get sick, and then you're going to die.

644
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
It's like, right, right.

645
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
So that's all nakedness.

646
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
If you think about nakedness as vulnerability.

647
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
And so we had to come to terms with her vulnerability

648
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
when we became self-conscious.

649
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
So then you might think,

650
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
well, what the hell does that have to do with morality?

651
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
And I did figure that out.

652
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
It took me like 15 years of thinking to figure that out.

653
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
It's like, if I know I'm naked and vulnerable,

654
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
and I know you are the same,

655
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
then I know what will hurt me.

656
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
And once I know what will hurt me,

657
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I know what will hurt you.

658
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
And so animals prey on each other.

659
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Lions eat gazelles,

660
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
and worms eat lions, and all of that.

661
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
But there's nothing like a human being

662
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
for sheer outright atrocious torture.

663
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
And you don't get that without self-consciousness.

664
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
So that's where I think the knowledge of good and evil comes.

665
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
It's like it's no longer prey and predator.

666
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
It's like torture and victim.

667
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
So that's one thing.

668
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
And part of that sets up this dichotomy in human beings

669
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
between whatever it is that our consciousness seems to be

670
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
and our self-consciousness,

671
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
and this terrible, limited burden that we carry around

672
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
as a body that we're conscious of.

673
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
So there's that dichotomy.

674
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
That dichotomy emerges back at the beginning

675
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
of the dichotomy of self-consciousness.

676
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
It's a problem we're trying to solve all the time.

677
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
And I mean, Nietzsche's criticism of Christianity

678
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
was that he believed that Christianity

679
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
failed to solve that problem

680
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
because instead of dealing with the reality of the catastrophe,

681
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
which is, say, the degenerate form of our material body,

682
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
the church basically damned that to perdition,

683
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
describing it as a work of the devils, so to speak,

684
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
and then concentrated on spiritual salvation.

685
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Now, you knew this element of Christian religious thought

686
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
and the Nietzschean transformations of that,

687
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
and that's part of the reason why he went back to alchemy,

688
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
because one of the things Jung was interested in was

689
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
why did science develop?

690
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
It only developed in Europe as far as we know,

691
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
and the Greeks didn't have it, and the Romans didn't have it,

692
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
and the Chinese didn't have it, and the Indians didn't have it,

693
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
and it's like, well, they weren't stupid.

694
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
What was up with them and why Europe?

695
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
What exactly happened there?

696
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
It's not like we precisely know the answer to that,

697
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
but one of the things that Jung suggested,

698
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
and it's brilliant as far as I'm concerned,

699
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:06,000
the cognitive apparatuses that we're blessed with are compensatory,

700
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
so that if we formulate a theory about one domain

701
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
and take it to a real extreme,

702
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:17,000
the unconscious mind will start to formulate a counter proposition,

703
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
which is formulated of all the things we notice

704
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
that don't fit in with that theory,

705
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
and then they start to flap around

706
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
and associate with each other as a consequence of emotional contagion,

707
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
and they start to manifest themselves in patterns,

708
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
and that once that counter position emerges

709
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
as a sufficiently complex and dynamic living system,

710
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
it has the opportunity to fight with the other system,

711
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
and sometimes you'll have a revelation,

712
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
and the revelation is basically the overthrow

713
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
of the current perspective by the new emergent perspective.

714
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Jung viewed alchemy in that light.

715
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
He said that the Christian concentration on hyper-spiritualization

716
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
was extremely useful, this is something Nietzsche agreed with,

717
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
was unbelievably useful for the discipline of the mind,

718
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
so Nietzsche, of course, is an anti-Christian,

719
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
at least that's what he said,

720
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
but he also said that Catholicism tempered the European spirit

721
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
like nothing else could have,

722
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
and he really meant the whole Judeo-Christian tradition,

723
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
which was the attempt to force everything

724
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
into a unified and hierarchically arranged interpretation.

725
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Nietzsche's idea was once you did that once, man,

726
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
you could go do that all sorts of different places,

727
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,000
so alchemy as a precursor to science

728
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
was based initially on a fantasy,

729
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
and the fantasy was if we paid enough attention

730
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
to the transformations of matter rather than of spirit,

731
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
that we could redeem what Christianity,

732
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
with its emphasis on the spirit, had failed to redeem.

733
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
So it was sort of like all the 14th century Europeans woke up

734
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
and said, hmm, Christ died for our sins,

735
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
and we're supposed to be redeemed,

736
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
but a lot of guys are down there with leprosy in the ditch,

737
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,000
so it doesn't seem to have exactly fulfilled its promise,

738
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
and so he felt that the European imagination

739
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
started to drift into the transformations of the material world,

740
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:13,000
but that was also part of what was fundamentally a redemptive process.

741
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
It was just a more comprehensive redemptive process.

742
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
It was, all right, well, we kind of got the spirit organized,

743
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
now it's time to do something about the dreadful body

744
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
that we're dragging around with us

745
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
instead of merely damning it to perdition.

746
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
And one of the things that you might think about,

747
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
because we're also thinking about practical issues here,

748
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
is, well, we talked about multiple meanings,

749
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
kind of multiple low-level meanings.

750
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
There's the meaning of food and the meaning of water

751
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
and the meaning of sex and, you know,

752
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
the meaning of being too hot and too cold,

753
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
and there's all biological subsystems

754
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
that take care of those sorts of things.

755
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
It's like those are organized hierarchically in principle,

756
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
so there's something lurking at the top.

757
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
And I think part of what religious mythologies do over years,

758
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
centuries, thousands of years,

759
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,000
is try to get a picture of what should be at the top.

760
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
That's like the monotheistic impulse.

761
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
What's the highest value?

762
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
And here's something to consider.

763
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
You know, you can wonder about this in your own lives

764
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
when people think about the meaning of their life.

765
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,000
What they mean is, are all the subsidiary meanings

766
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
meaningful given that there's an ultimate reality

767
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
of suffering and limitation.

768
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
And so one of the things that might be asked,

769
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
and I think that scientists do ask this in part,

770
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
is maybe we shouldn't deal with that question

771
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
before we fix everything we can possibly fix.

772
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
And so one of the things that I would also suggest

773
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
is that when you're motivated by meanings

774
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
that are other than subsidiary,

775
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
say the same meanings that animate mammals and reptiles

776
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
and even bloody lobsters, for that matter,

777
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
when you're working at higher-order levels of meaning,

778
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
partly what you're attempting to do

779
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
is to generate solutions to the micro-problems

780
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
of negative meaning that always beset you.

781
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
You know, it's like, well,

782
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
is there something wrong in your family?

783
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Well, that's meaningful.

784
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
The meaning is negative.

785
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
So does that make your family worthwhile or worthless?

786
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Well, the question is,

787
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
depends on what you do with your family.

788
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
And you know, so the problem with nihilism,

789
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
as far as I can tell, is that the nihilist presumes

790
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
that the finitude that we perceive

791
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
invalidates the utility of being.

792
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
It's like, well, that's pretty arrogant, you might say.

793
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
You might say that judging the whole world in that light,

794
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
which is what that comedian just did on that TV show

795
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
that he laid into God, I can't remember his name,

796
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
blaming him for bone cancer and children, for example,

797
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
which really does suck, you know.

798
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
So the point is, is that one of the things

799
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
that we find meaningful and we could find meaningful

800
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
and that's reliable is,

801
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
let's leave the damn question aside about the ultimate meaning

802
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
of reality in its corrupt form, which is now,

803
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
and try to fix the damn thing.

804
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Really try to fix it.

805
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
And then see what happens,

806
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
it's clear that we can make things better

807
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
and it's bloody clear that we can make things worse,

808
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
so you might ask, okay, well, if you organized

809
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
your little value hierarchy underneath the proposition

810
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
that it's up to you to work to bring the kingdom of God

811
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
to life instead of hell, then maybe the whole problem

812
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
of the negative meaning of life would go away.

813
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
It's like you never know, beats the alternative,

814
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
which is to damn the whole thing to perdition,

815
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
which we really tried hard to do in the 20th century

816
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
with a fair bit of success, or just to think,

817
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
oh, well, this is meaningless and useless

818
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
and I don't have any responsibility

819
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
and there's no such thing as meaning,

820
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
and it's like, sure, walk down that road, man,

821
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
see where you go.

822
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Okay.

823
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
It seems the both of you agree that there's this

824
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
lower level meaning system that we have,

825
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
which is almost like a moment to moment perceptual system

826
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
where we know how to interact with things.

827
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
And both of you disagree, both of you agree

828
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
that there's no higher level, the meaning of life.

829
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
But in alluding to the meaning crisis

830
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
and just general morality, you seem to assume

831
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
that we can somehow cobble this ability

832
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
to know how to interact with the glass,

833
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
to somehow interact with societies.

834
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,000
So how do you think we're able to do this?

835
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
First of all, to be careful,

836
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
and I said there's no ultimate meaning,

837
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
and like I said, I was also not saying

838
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
that that means that there's no ultimate meaning

839
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
because if you say a problem is poorly formed,

840
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
you're rejecting both the positive

841
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
and the negative answer to that question.

842
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
It doesn't imply that, therefore,

843
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
the ultimate meaning is that there's no meaning.

844
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
It's like saying what's north of the North Pole.

845
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
The answer is not anything.

846
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
It's to reject the question.

847
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
So I first want to challenge that move you made.

848
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Secondly, I do think that...

849
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I want to reply...

850
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I do think that what I'm trying to argue for,

851
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
and I think Jordan is, but I'm not clear

852
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
because he said about 17,000 things in his last thing.

853
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I want to try and reply to them.

854
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
I'll spin them out, you sort of.

855
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I'm arguing for a deep continuity

856
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
between those lower level processes

857
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
and the highest levels.

858
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
And I think Nietzsche tried to foreshadow that,

859
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
and this is again what I mean about the...

860
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Nietzsche said, the height of my spirituality

861
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
reaches into the depth of my sexuality.

862
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
To try and find...

863
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
He was using both of those in a metaphorical extension.

864
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
I'm not only arguing for the lower level...

865
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
It's a pretty good statement for a virgin, too.

866
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
He was referring to Nietzsche, by the way, not me.

867
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
So I'm arguing for what I think is a very important thesis,

868
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
which is a deep continuity between the lower level

869
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
and, just speaking of it metaphorically, the higher level.

870
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I do think there is an important issue

871
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
in which we can talk about that higher level

872
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
as distinct from the lower level

873
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
of just trying to solve our daily problems,

874
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
which I think is important.

875
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Namely, and that's something that I think is important,

876
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
is that we can talk about that higher level

877
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
of problems, which I think is important.

878
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Namely, and that's something that you referenced, Jordan.

879
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
We face a perennial problem of our self-consciousness,

880
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
and the problem with our self-consciousness

881
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
is it means we have this enormous capacity

882
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
to take a perspective on our own ability to take perspectives.

883
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
I mean, one of the things about being a conscious being,

884
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
and this is what I mean about a salient's landscape,

885
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
is we not only know facts, like propositions,

886
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
and we know how to do things,

887
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
we also have perspectival knowing.

888
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
This is the work I did with Leo Ferraro.

889
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
We know what it is like to be a certain thing,

890
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
to take a certain perspective,

891
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
to take a certain stance on the world.

892
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
I know what it's like to be a father.

893
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
I know what it's like to be a teacher.

894
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
And that perspectival knowing,

895
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
of knowing what it's like to be something,

896
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
is, again, this atmospheric meaning.

897
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
But the thing we can do

898
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
is we can take a perspective on that lower-order perspective.

899
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
We can stand back and say,

900
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
what does that perspective look like?

901
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Let me give you an example.

902
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
I'm thirsty.

903
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
And so I have a thirsting perspective on the world.

904
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Things that are watery are salient to me.

905
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Things that might contain water.

906
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
You're getting thirsty right now, too, right?

907
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
It becomes salient to me.

908
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
But I can step back,

909
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
and this was something also discovered in India,

910
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
by the Buddhists,

911
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
I can step back

912
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
and take a look at my thirsting perspective.

913
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I can say, what's it like to be a thirsty person?

914
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
And now I'm no longer thirsting,

915
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
because I'm now motivated

916
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
by something different than my thirst.

917
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
I'm motivated by my curiosity

918
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
about my lower-order thirst.

919
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
And then I can step back

920
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
and say, gee,

921
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
what's it like to be curious?

922
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
And then I can step back and wonder,

923
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
what's it like to be somebody asking

924
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
what's it like to be curious?

925
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
And then you can step back and say,

926
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
what's it like watching someone

927
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
listen to someone talk about being curious about it?

928
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Exactly.

929
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
That's what I'm trying to make.

930
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
The point I'm trying to make

931
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
is what happens is

932
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
we have the capacity

933
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
to very quickly

934
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
move ourselves to what Nagel calls the view from nowhere.

935
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
To this bird's eye

936
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
or God's eye perspective

937
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
on all of reality,

938
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
in which we, by these recursive

939
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
asking of questions,

940
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
we have become deeply disengaged

941
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
from our involvement with the world.

942
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
We have an enormous capacity

943
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
for self-transcendence.

944
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
And I think this was also one of Nietzsche's insights,

945
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
although I think Nishitani called him

946
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
excellently to question on it.

947
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Our capacity for self-transcendence,

948
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
our ability to rise above ourselves,

949
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
is also the very same thing

950
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
that can cause us to fall into despair

951
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
and absurdity.

952
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Because we can empty the world

953
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
of all that involved meaning

954
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
by our capacity to transcend ourselves

955
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
to such a degree

956
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
that we are overlooking it all

957
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
for like five seconds here.

958
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Okay, so I have a proposition

959
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
that goes along with this. You guys can think about this.

960
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
And I think

961
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
it's one of the advantages

962
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
of contemplating the notion

963
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
that meaning might be an actual phenomena

964
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
in and of itself. So I would say

965
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
you might say, well, when should you stop

966
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
recursing? Which is

967
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
what's the right level of analysis? Because I could say

968
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
who cares about this damn talk? The Sun

969
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
is going to envelop the Earth in four billion years.

970
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
It's like, you know, because that's

971
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
the ultimate meaninglessness of everything.

972
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
And my answer to that is

973
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
that's a stupid place to stand.

974
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
And the evidence for that

975
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
is, think about it this way, is that

976
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
if your capacity to experience

977
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
the kind of meaning that imbues your

978
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
life with

979
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
forward motion and with faith

980
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
and with joy and with gratitude,

981
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
imagine that that's actually a function

982
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
that you have psychologically.

983
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
And then imagine that that function

984
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
kicks in when you're looking at

985
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
things from the right perspective.

986
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
And so you might say, well

987
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
is this talk important? It's like

988
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
what's important to me right now? It seems to be

989
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
important to you guys. It has some potential

990
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
importance tomorrow and next week.

991
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
There's all meaning there. Is it

992
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
important from the perspective

993
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
of the age of the cosmos?

994
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Well,

995
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
probably, but probably

996
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
perhaps not.

997
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
And so then I would say, well what does that do to

998
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
my sense of engagement with the issues at hand?

999
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
It undermines them and I fall into

1000
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
a pit of meaninglessness and so then

1001
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
I would say, well, hey let's not fall into that pit.

1002
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Let's pick a level of analysis

1003
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
for the problem at hand

1004
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
that most richly imbues it

1005
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
with a sense of meaning and then

1006
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
let's assume that that's part of the mechanism

1007
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
that calibrates our soul, so to speak

1008
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
and pay attention to that.

1009
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
And so because I tell my students this all the time.

1010
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Wander around

1011
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
and notice what's

1012
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
meaningful to you. Just notice it.

1013
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
It happens. You

1014
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
can participate and you're absolutely right about that.

1015
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
But it happens. Okay.

1016
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Try to stay where meaning

1017
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
is optimized. And then I also

1018
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
mention to them briefly

1019
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
that that's kind of what the Taoist symbol is about

1020
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
because the Taoist symbol is predicated

1021
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
on the idea in a sense

1022
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
that the world is made out of disorder,

1023
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
chaos and order and

1024
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
that there's a balance between those two things

1025
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
and that if you stand on

1026
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
the border between order and chaos

1027
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
so that things are structured properly

1028
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
but you're still a little uncertain and curious

1029
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
then that's a richly meaningful

1030
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
place from a phenomenological perspective

1031
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
and it's like that's the right place

1032
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
to stand. How do you know?

1033
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Because you want to be alive despite

1034
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
the fact that you're suffering. It's like

1035
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
hey, there's some evidence. You can't get

1036
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
there though without, you know, the initial

1037
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
presupposition that there's something deeply

1038
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
real about meaning and

1039
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
I think real is life sustaining

1040
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
that's part of what real is. That's a

1041
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Nietzschean idea too. Okay, well

1042
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
let me respond to that.

1043
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
I want to push back on you on that a bit

1044
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
because I think that's not being fair to

1045
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Nagle's argument because the point Nagle was trying

1046
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
to make is, you know, you said

1047
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
that's a stupid place to stand. It depends on what you're trying

1048
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
to achieve. Right, if you're trying to do

1049
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
science and you're trying to reduce

1050
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
the way we self-deceptively

1051
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
project bias onto the world

1052
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
then you progressively move to

1053
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
these higher views because

1054
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
every time you, I mean

1055
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
that is what we do. That is how we try to reduce

1056
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
bias. I mean, when I can take a

1057
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
the reason I, it's good for me to take

1058
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
a perspective on my lower-order perspective

1059
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
is it helps me to determine bias

1060
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
and distortion in this perspective.

1061
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
So if I want to remove bias and distortion

1062
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
if I want to get at reality and truth

1063
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
and let's assume we have that platonic drive

1064
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
then that feeds into

1065
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
this drive to go higher and higher

1066
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
and higher and higher

1067
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
because as I go higher and higher and higher

1068
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
I am removing distortion. I am

1069
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
removing illusion.

1070
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
That seems to me to be, that's

1071
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
partly why I'm a pragmatist, fundamentally

1072
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
and it's because you're right

1073
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
about that. Yeah, but pragmatism

1074
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
is parasitic on an independent notion of truth.

1075
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
You have to be able to know

1076
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
independent of its usefulness that

1077
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
something is useful.

1078
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
You have to have some way of saying

1079
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
I know that it's true that this

1080
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
is useful, that my perception

1081
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
of its usefulness is not itself distorted.

1082
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Okay, I'm not disagreeing with that at all.

1083
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I think that what

1084
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
correct me if I'm wrong.

1085
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
You basically

1086
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
you seem to be making an argument that goes

1087
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
something like this, is that

1088
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
there are different lenses and different

1089
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
levels of resolution for different tasks.

1090
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
That's right. I agree with that.

1091
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Absolutely. But I'm also making the argument

1092
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
that

1093
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
the drive towards the view from nowhere

1094
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
has just as deep

1095
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
a purchase on us. That platonic quest

1096
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
to get at the

1097
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
the undistorted. We shouldn't

1098
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
be assuming that nowhere is the ultimate

1099
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
stance. It's like it has

1100
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
its zone of relevance and you've laid

1101
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
that out quite nicely. That's exactly what

1102
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
I'm saying. But what I'm trying to say is

1103
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
just to say to someone

1104
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
don't go as far

1105
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
as you can because you might

1106
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
fall into absurdity

1107
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
to me sounds like

1108
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
well, give into

1109
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
self deception because

1110
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
that will be comforting.

1111
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
I guess this is partly

1112
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
my experience as

1113
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
a clinician speaking as well.

1114
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Because sometimes people get overwhelmed

1115
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
by absurdity. They don't go there.

1116
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
You know what I mean? It's not the right place

1117
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
for them to be. But I would also say

1118
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
that you shouldn't pick problems that are bigger

1119
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
than the ones that you can solve.

1120
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I disagree with you.

1121
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
We've got to clarify that because I don't think that you

1122
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
I mean we're doing that right now.

1123
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
I know.

1124
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
I know. But we're also

1125
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
not claiming to have the answer.

1126
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
But that value as I said from the beginning

1127
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
isn't in the answer. But in the

1128
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
self-transcendent transformation of the question.

1129
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
And what I

1130
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
was trying to say

1131
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
is that

1132
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
yes, I agree that

1133
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
right

1134
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
I don't think

1135
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
absurdity is caused by

1136
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
the fact that you're

1137
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
the highest level. I mean again

1138
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
that's not Navel's point. Absurdity is caused

1139
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
by the fact that we can

1140
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
find a clash between any

1141
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
two levels we pick. He gives this example.

1142
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Okay. Okay. So

1143
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
he gives this example and

1144
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
please understand this because we're

1145
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
older than you. There was a time

1146
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
there was a time when people's

1147
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
phones were in specific

1148
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
locations.

1149
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
And if somebody called

1150
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
you you were often not with your phone

1151
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
and so you had to have a recording device

1152
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
to pick up the messages.

1153
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
I know we had just discovered

1154
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
fire but that's what it was like.

1155
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
So he gives the example from

1156
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
that time because he wrote the article in the early 80s

1157
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
and so there's this individual

1158
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
he calls up and they're like

1159
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
and he picks up the here's the pickup

1160
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
and he says he's been all prepared. He says

1161
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Susan, just don't talk. I got to

1162
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
tell you this. I got to get it out. I

1163
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
love you. I've loved you for a long time. It's really

1164
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
interesting. And then he hears

1165
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Susan's not here right now.

1166
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Please leave a message.

1167
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
And you're laughing because

1168
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
humor is also about this juxtaposition

1169
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
of perspectives.

1170
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
And what's happened is that

1171
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
act that seems so meaningful from

1172
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
one's perspective is completely

1173
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
inconsistent with the machine's

1174
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
perspective, the recording

1175
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
machine. It's the clash between

1176
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
perspectives, not a particular

1177
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
perspective per se

1178
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
that I think is what the experience of

1179
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
absurdity is. It could be and

1180
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
but it might be or.

1181
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Well, I think no because

1182
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
here's why I would challenge you. Okay, okay.

1183
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Because I would put Spinoza against

1184
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Nietzsche. Spinoza advocating

1185
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
advocated going to that highest

1186
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
view and then found a way to reconcile

1187
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
it with the lowest perspective

1188
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
the engaged perspective and he said that was

1189
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
the blessed life. Okay, okay. So he argued

1190
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
that the, I mean I think

1191
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
that's why The Ethics is a great book that deserves

1192
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
to be read in contrast to Nietzsche, right?

1193
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Is he argued that there

1194
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
is a way to reconcile

1195
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
those two perspectives. He called it

1196
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Scantia Intuitiva. And it's the

1197
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
reconciliation of those two perspectives

1198
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
that alleviates absurdity.

1199
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Not the preclusion of going to one

1200
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
or the remaining in fixed in the other.

1201
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
And I think that that's very

1202
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
in a very, that's very similar

1203
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
in some profoundly important ways.

1204
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
There's important historical differences to what Buddhism

1205
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
is trying to advocate.

1206
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Buddhism is about

1207
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
you know, in meditative practice

1208
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
we practice sort of going deeply immersive

1209
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
and in contemplative practice we go

1210
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
deeply out and then the point in Buddhism

1211
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
is that those are supposed to become

1212
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
eventually completely interpenetrating

1213
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
so that the absurdity that's caused by the clash

1214
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
between perspectives is removed.

1215
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
I think the fault, as you said earlier

1216
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
is not in any perspective but in the

1217
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
self-consciousness that pits perspectives

1218
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
against each other. Good, that's very nice.

1219
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
That's very nice. I mean I think that's a very

1220
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
good one. And I

1221
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
take no issue with it.

1222
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
I want to take that line of reasoning

1223
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
in a different direction. We'll

1224
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
play that same line of

1225
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
logic in another way.

1226
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
So Victor was

1227
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
asking earlier, and it's a level

1228
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
of resolution perspective again. It's like

1229
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
okay, well this is really great, it's the meaning

1230
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
of the glass. It's like well yeah, what does

1231
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
that have to do with the meaning of life?

1232
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
I think the person who answered

1233
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
that best actually was Piaget.

1234
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Let me tell you a little bit about Piaget

1235
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
because the first thing about

1236
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
he was a famous child developmental psychologist

1237
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
by the way, the most famous of the 20th

1238
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
century. He was actually

1239
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
trying to solve the

1240
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
conflict between religion and science.

1241
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
You never hear that about Piaget but he had

1242
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
messianic experiences when he was a young

1243
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
man and he wrote a novel about it and he wanted

1244
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
to reconcile religion and science.

1245
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
He actually did a pretty damn

1246
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
good job.

1247
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
So here's the issue

1248
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
and you can think about it this way. So this is how

1249
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
a baby builds himself or herself

1250
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
up.

1251
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
So learn to move

1252
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
finger.

1253
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Learn to move hand.

1254
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Learn to move hand and arms.

1255
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Learn to move body, hand, arms,

1256
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
legs and feet. Learn to orient

1257
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
head.

1258
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Learn to use integrated body

1259
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
to

1260
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
undertake independent tasks.

1261
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Then

1262
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
learn to use integrated body that can

1263
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
undertake independent tasks in

1264
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
concert with another integrated

1265
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
body that can undertake

1266
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
specific tasks. You do that when

1267
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
you play a game. The game is

1268
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
we'll say the game is

1269
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
we're two little girls having

1270
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
tea. So what's the goal?

1271
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
The goal is that we learn how

1272
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
to be mutually

1273
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
respectful while we're sharing

1274
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
nourishment, which is a big deal by the way.

1275
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
It's something humans are unbelievably good

1276
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
at. It's extremely sophisticated.

1277
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
We're very social eaters, so if we're

1278
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
not eating socially, we're fat

1279
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
or anorexic. We

1280
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
have to eat socially to regulate our

1281
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
own behavior because we're social eaters.

1282
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
And so we're learning how to play

1283
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
the game of sharing food.

1284
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
But the game has other rules than that.

1285
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
It's like we're learning how to play the game of sharing food

1286
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
in a way so that we're playing the game

1287
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
so that we want the game to continue.

1288
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
So that's an important

1289
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
point. And then if we get more

1290
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
educated, then we say we're learning to play

1291
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
the game so that it's enjoyable

1292
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
for a larger number of people

1293
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
in a larger number of situations

1294
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
across larger spans of time.

1295
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
And so that's a hierarchical

1296
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
organization of fundamental abilities

1297
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
into

1298
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
solutions that have generalizability

1299
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
across more and more contexts.

1300
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Now Piaget built that way

1301
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
up. And he said

1302
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
this is associated with this idea of

1303
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
levels too.

1304
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Piaget believed, and this is

1305
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
his scientific justification for

1306
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
emergent morality in some sense,

1307
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
is that

1308
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
it's within a Darwinian framework, again,

1309
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
not within a Newtonian framework. So Piaget

1310
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
had a proposition, and the proposition

1311
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
was this.

1312
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
You're the bully at the moment.

1313
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Victor and I are having tea.

1314
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
And you want us to play a different game.

1315
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
You want us to play, I don't know

1316
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
what do you want us to play? Pull the cat's tail.

1317
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
You're a bully after all.

1318
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
And so

1319
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
we don't want to play pull the cat's tail.

1320
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
And so what do you

1321
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
have to do? Well, you have to

1322
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
expend a lot of time and energy

1323
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
enforcing the game. And the reason you have to do

1324
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
that is because we don't want to play the damn game,

1325
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
so we're going to do everything we can

1326
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
to stop you, to subvert it.

1327
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
And so what that means is that you're going to

1328
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
and we're going to expend a tremendous

1329
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
amount of energy in a pursuit

1330
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
where we could have picked a pursuit

1331
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
where there was virtually no energy spent

1332
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
or resources. So Piaget's idea

1333
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
was that an

1334
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
equilibrated game,

1335
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
which is a game that everyone will play voluntarily,

1336
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
if you pit that

1337
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
in an open competition, you could say a Darwinian

1338
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
competition, against

1339
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
a disequilibrated game that requires

1340
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
force to maintain your basic

1341
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
totalitarian state, if you pit

1342
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
those in a one-to-one competition or your

1343
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
totalitarian personality, if you

1344
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
pit them in a one-to-one competition

1345
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
in relationship to the attainment

1346
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
of virtually any goal across

1347
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
multiple contexts, the equilibrated

1348
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
game will win.

1349
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
And that's why it's better.

1350
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
And there's other reasons too. It's better because

1351
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
it isn't only a solution

1352
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
to a problem that's posed in one place.

1353
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
It's a meta-solution

1354
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
to a meta-problem that's posed in many places.

1355
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
I'll just give one example.

1356
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Okay, so

1357
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
you all tell your kids

1358
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
be a good sport.

1359
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
And your kids, being intelligent kids, think

1360
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
well, don't we want to win this game?

1361
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
It's like, of course

1362
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
you want to win the game. Okay, so why can't

1363
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
I bash the guy next to me over the head with

1364
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
my hockey stick, as long as I don't get caught?

1365
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
That's a Canadian example, right?

1366
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
So I'll tell you a story.

1367
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
I went to this hockey game once, and my son

1368
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
was playing, and that was really fun.

1369
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
And he was in a, like, the final

1370
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
game, and

1371
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
there was a kid on his team who was

1372
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
he was a great hockey player, very, very good

1373
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
hockey player. But

1374
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
it was all him, man.

1375
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
He had the puck he wouldn't pass, and he was

1376
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
pretty good at scoring and so on, but he wasn't

1377
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
playing with the team, and he was

1378
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
playing to win. It was fine, fine, fine.

1379
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
So my son's

1380
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
team lost. It was a great game. I think it

1381
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
was, like, four to three at the end, and the

1382
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
other team scored in the last 30 seconds or whatever.

1383
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
And then all the kids came off the

1384
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
ice, and the parent of this

1385
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
one kid, who's like the little hero

1386
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
hockey player, comes up to him, and

1387
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
the kid had, like, smashed his stick against

1388
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
the cement, and he was all

1389
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
running around and cursing the referees,

1390
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
and the father

1391
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
came running up to him and said,

1392
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
you were robbed. You know, you absolutely should

1393
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
have won that. And I thought,

1394
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
you're such an idiot.

1395
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
And he was, he was truly

1396
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
an idiot, and a pathological

1397
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
one at that. And he was

1398
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
really destroying his child's soul.

1399
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
And here's, this is

1400
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
not funny. It's true. That is what

1401
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
he was doing. I saw it happen over a long

1402
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
time. That was just a microcosm

1403
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
of their relationship and his attitude towards

1404
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
the world. Now, why was that

1405
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
wrong? It's like, the kid

1406
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
wanted to win. It's like, yay, go

1407
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
man, went to win. He was a

1408
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
really good hockey player.

1409
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
So what was wrong with what the father

1410
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
did? Okay. So then we step

1411
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
back and we say, it's

1412
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
not important whether you win or lose. It's how

1413
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
you play the game. So what does that

1414
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
mean? Well, it doesn't actually

1415
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
mean what it says, because it actually is important

1416
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
whether you win or lose. You should be trying

1417
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
to win. But then

1418
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
the question is,

1419
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
what are you trying to win?

1420
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Now, then that

1421
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
gets complicated. It's like

1422
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
while you're trying to win

1423
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
being the best hockey player on your team,

1424
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
are you trying to win that hockey game?

1425
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Or are you

1426
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
trying to win the opportunity to be

1427
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
invited to play as many games as

1428
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
you can possibly play with as many people

1429
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
in as many contexts as you possibly

1430
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
can across the entire course

1431
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
of your life? Okay.

1432
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
That's what winning means.

1433
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
And so the rule is

1434
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
don't win the

1435
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
local and proximal event

1436
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
at the price of being a

1437
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
player in the multitude of

1438
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
iterable games. That's the moral principle.

1439
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
You know? Don't put

1440
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
the cart before the horse, so to speak.

1441
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
And the reason for that is that

1442
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
a game is a microcosm of life.

1443
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
That's a Piagetian idea, which is why,

1444
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
by the way, we like games and we'll watch

1445
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
them and we're thrilled about them and we engage

1446
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
in them all the time. But the game

1447
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
isn't the issue.

1448
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
The issue in some sense is the set

1449
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
of all possible games.

1450
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
And the most moral action is

1451
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
the action that will enable you to have

1452
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
the highest probability of winning

1453
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
the set of all possible games.

1454
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
And it's even a little more complicated than that,

1455
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
which is you have to be

1456
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
a player in the set of all possible

1457
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
games in a manner that supports the

1458
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
existence of as many games as possible.

1459
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
And that's, and so

1460
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
you see what I mean, and human beings can do that

1461
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
because we can go up that damn chain

1462
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
of abstraction, right? We don't have to

1463
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
just concentrate on this

1464
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
or a game of let's make

1465
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
tea, you know? We can play these metagames

1466
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
and pose these metag questions.

1467
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
And one of Piaget's claims was

1468
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
don't kid yourself

1469
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
about this. There are rules.

1470
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
There are rules. There are rules for games.

1471
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
There's lots that aren't playable.

1472
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
The rule for a sustainable game is

1473
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
everybody wants to play.

1474
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Now, another rule is that some people get

1475
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
to try to win, you know?

1476
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
So, but obviously

1477
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
that's not where the abstraction level

1478
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
tops out. And so I love that.

1479
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
It's like, oh, that's so cool.

1480
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
There's a hierarchy of moral value

1481
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
because that's action orientation.

1482
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
And it's an emergent property of the way

1483
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
that complex systems organize themselves.

1484
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
They're basically dominance hierarchies, by the way.

1485
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
And not only that, that

1486
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
system of organization has been around

1487
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
for so long, and I think it's

1488
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
about 400 million years,

1489
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
that we're actually biologically

1490
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
adapted to that structure.

1491
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Because we know that there are dominance hierarchies

1492
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
that can sustain themselves quite nicely across time.

1493
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
And those usually value

1494
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
the individual and the relationship between

1495
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
the individual and society.

1496
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
And there's those that don't. And we're really

1497
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
adapted to the ones that do because those are

1498
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
the ones in which we live when we live.

1499
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
And so this is deeply biological

1500
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
and it's also emergent at the same time.

1501
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
So it's a testament to your notion

1502
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
that it is

1503
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
necessary to be able to reconcile

1504
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
the local view with the ultimate view.

1505
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
And the more you can ensure that those

1506
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
levels aren't in conflict with one another,

1507
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
that's exactly what a Piagetian

1508
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
equilibrating state is. Is that the union

1509
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
has been attained across the multiple levels

1510
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
of hierarchical organization.

1511
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
That's...

1512
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Take that.

1513
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
I will take it. You know

1514
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
that I've always liked

1515
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
this argument of yours. I think it's one of your best.

1516
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
And

1517
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
which is not a left handed insult of your other argument.

1518
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
I really like this

1519
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
argument. I think it's a good work.

1520
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
And I've thought about it and I want to share

1521
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
some thoughts I have about it with you.

1522
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
I thought, I think that

1523
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
and this is to allude back to

1524
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Spinoza again in contrast to Nietzsche,

1525
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
I think

1526
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
then again this is the platonic insight.

1527
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
I mean because Plato of course had

1528
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
a metaphor also for

1529
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
this moving up the levels. It's the metaphor

1530
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
of coming out of the cave into the real world.

1531
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
And I think what I

1532
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
want to say is the highest level

1533
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
of the metagame is the game

1534
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
because games are again things that exist

1535
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
between us and the world, right?

1536
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
I think the highest

1537
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
level of the metagame is the game

1538
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
of intelligibility.

1539
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
I mean I think

1540
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
what we have to have

1541
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
ultimately, and this is what Habermas was

1542
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
on about, right? You have to have

1543
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
shareable intelligibility

1544
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
to do. That's the highest

1545
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
thing. We have to constantly

1546
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
be committed to that.

1547
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
That the grounding

1548
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
normativity of all of our moral

1549
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
normativities is actually

1550
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
this normative demand make things

1551
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
intelligible. And I think

1552
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
So do you think about that as a

1553
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
precondition for the emergence

1554
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
of cooperative games? Yes. So it's like

1555
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
getting the rules straight.

1556
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Getting the language by which you can

1557
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
formulate the rules straight

1558
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
and using language in a very extended

1559
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
metaphor. And so

1560
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
I think

1561
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
part of the issue for us, though as human

1562
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
beings, is

1563
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
that we do have this drive to

1564
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
get at what is, try to

1565
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
to get the

1566
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
maximal intelligibility project. And I think

1567
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
science tries to do that in some ways.

1568
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
But

1569
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
the problem is that we then

1570
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
and let me talk for a couple

1571
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
minutes on this. We hit

1572
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
a kind of perennial problem. We have

1573
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
these two different notions

1574
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
vis-a-vis intelligibility about what

1575
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
realness is. And I thought, I wanted

1576
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
to ask you about this because I want to know if this lines up

1577
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
with your chaos order thing.

1578
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
We have one notion of

1579
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
realness that what to say

1580
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
that something is real is to say

1581
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
that it is coherent,

1582
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
it is confirmed,

1583
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
it is coherent. Things have

1584
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
come together, right?

1585
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
And there's this mutual

1586
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
fittedness. And then we also

1587
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
have a notion that no, what's real

1588
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
is what catches us by surprise.

1589
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
What was outside of our system

1590
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
and that what we didn't know

1591
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
right? And that's when we get at reality.

1592
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
So we have these two notions of realness

1593
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
and I think we have two for very

1594
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
good reason by the way. I think we

1595
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
actually have three.

1596
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Those are two of them for sure.

1597
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
So I think what we have is we do have

1598
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
this confirmation notion

1599
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
and then we have this

1600
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
surprise notion. And science

1601
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
tries to pit the two against each other.

1602
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
So what you try to do is you try

1603
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
and do the theory part which is all the

1604
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
confirming coherence part. And then you run

1605
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
experiments in which the world can

1606
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
basically make you go, oh shit.

1607
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
And then you've got to, oh, right?

1608
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
At the level you wanted to.

1609
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Yes, of course. You don't want to burn down

1610
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
your lab. Or you don't want to horrify yourself

1611
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
oh my god flowers can talk or something like that.

1612
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Yeah, too much chemistry there.

1613
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Right.

1614
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
And so

1615
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
part of the problem though

1616
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
is that although science in one sense

1617
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
tended to try to

1618
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
science is largely

1619
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
to some degree a psychotechnology of trying to

1620
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
integrate those two together so that they work coherently

1621
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
for us but also surprisingly

1622
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
for us. Part of the problem

1623
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
though is when Descartes, and I guess I'll put

1624
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Descartes before the horse here, is

1625
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
what? Is that Nietzsche's horse?

1626
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Yeah.

1627
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
We were talking about putting the cart before the horse.

1628
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
I was like, Nietzsche,

1629
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Descartes did something

1630
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
he really exacerbated those two

1631
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
and he put a chasm between them.

1632
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
He said, look, what's real

1633
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
is sort of what's

1634
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
externally measurable

1635
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
by mathematics. So the mathematical

1636
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
properties are the real properties

1637
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
and all the subjective ones are just in my head.

1638
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
But then he said this opposite thing.

1639
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
You know what's most real? My mind.

1640
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
And how it touches itself.

1641
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
And this is completely

1642
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
inexplicable. It's just this direct contact

1643
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
thing. So, and then what he said is

1644
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
right?

1645
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
He didn't ever try to reconcile them

1646
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
and so what we've done in the West

1647
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
is we careen between these two different senses

1648
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
of realness. We careen between

1649
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
real is the mathematical out there-ness.

1650
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
No, no, real is the subjective

1651
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
inhere-ness. And you can always

1652
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
pit one against the opposite because

1653
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
this could all be a dream.

1654
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Right? Oh, no, no.

1655
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
If it was a dream, you'd be naked.

1656
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
So I'm a naked bully.

1657
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Okay, so

1658
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
but of course

1659
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
then we do the opposite and say,

1660
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
oh, no, that's just an illusion. You're just

1661
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
dreaming and we do the opposite thing.

1662
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
And so what I'm suggesting

1663
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
has happened is

1664
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
our attempts to

1665
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
our attempts to

1666
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
ground or get a clear purchase

1667
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
on the metagame

1668
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
are exacerbated

1669
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
by the perennial problem

1670
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
that we have these two conflicting notions of

1671
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
realness. Right? Yeah.

1672
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
And then the historical problem that

1673
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Descartes basically

1674
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
put this chasm between these

1675
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
two different notions. He created

1676
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Cartesian dualism. There's

1677
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
these two worlds. This is subjective world

1678
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
and the objective world, they share no properties.

1679
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
There's no way to reconcile. And what we do

1680
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
is we constantly there. We constantly

1681
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
undermine. Our notion of

1682
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
realness is rendered permanently

1683
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
unstable. And so

1684
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
I'm not at all challenging you

1685
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
to understand that. I feel like you've just

1686
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
like, tossed me a pumpkin in slow motion

1687
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
so I can bat it out of the park.

1688
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Okay, well let me just

1689
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
finish and then I'll let you hit the pumpkin.

1690
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Um,

1691
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
so once again

1692
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
what I'm trying to indicate is

1693
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
I think you're right. I think

1694
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
I think it deeply

1695
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
matters to us to reconcile

1696
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
the meta

1697
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
game and the highest meta game I think is

1698
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
the realness game against the lower game

1699
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
and and and I think

1700
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
that is the grounding of our our

1701
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
moral drive. I think that is deeply right.

1702
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Now what I'm suggesting to you

1703
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
is there's a perennial problem given

1704
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
our sort of fundamental epistemic

1705
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
machinery that undermines

1706
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
our sense of realness

1707
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
and that is interacting with a historical

1708
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
factor

1709
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Descartes separation of the two worlds

1710
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
and those are now reinforcing each other in a vicious

1711
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
way in our time so that

1712
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
we can't get a stable enough

1713
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
notion of realness so that

1714
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
we can bring about the very reconciliation

1715
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
that you say we long for

1716
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
and we need and that's part and parcel of

1717
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
what I mean when I say we're in a meaning crisis.

1718
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
It's great. It's great.

1719
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
That's the other one I think. So, okay,

1720
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
so

1721
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
you know

1722
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
there's this there's this brand of psychological

1723
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
thinking that's basically based in

1724
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Freud via a guy named Ernest Becker

1725
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
who wrote a book called The Denial of Death

1726
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
in the 1970s and it won a Pulitzer Prize

1727
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
it's a pretty good book and it takes

1728
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Freud's idea that

1729
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
religion is a

1730
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
defense against death anxiety

1731
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
and it develops that

1732
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
in a very intelligent and comprehensive manner

1733
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
so Becker was trying to update Freudian

1734
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
psychoanalytic theory and kind of had the last

1735
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
word on it and I really think he did that. It's a brilliant

1736
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
book but it's really wrong.

1737
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
But it's wrong in a great way which is something

1738
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
to say about a book.

1739
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
I'd like to be wrong like that.

1740
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Yeah, it'd be great to be wrong like that in some important

1741
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
way. Yeah, absolutely.

1742
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
So, first of all, religion

1743
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
one of religion's diverse and

1744
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
multitudinous functions

1745
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
is that it provides some

1746
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
security

1747
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
against the anxiety of death. It's not the reason

1748
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
for it. It's like you got to beware of people

1749
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
who ever say that one thing

1750
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
is the reason for, you know, that's an

1751
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
ideologue, right? It's like, well, it's all

1752
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
economics. It's all sex. It's all

1753
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
fear. It's like, no, it's not.

1754
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
That's not right and it's simple-minded

1755
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
and it's wrong.

1756
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
So, you know, that's a flaw

1757
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
to some degree in Freudian thinking although he was

1758
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
very smart. He knew about aggression and all sorts

1759
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
of other things. Anyway, it's back to Becker. So there's

1760
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
this idea that

1761
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
our meaning systems

1762
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
that's the internal structure we use to organize

1763
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
the chaos of the world

1764
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
protect us from the anxiety of death.

1765
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
And then, so that's one

1766
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
form of meaning for Becker.

1767
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
And modern mortality salience.

1768
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Yeah, it's the same thing. That's Becker's.

1769
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
It's an elaboration of Becker. It doesn't

1770
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
really have much to add to Becker, actually.

1771
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
So

1772
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
there's something

1773
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
that's right about that because we do use

1774
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
our belief systems to defend ourselves

1775
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
but we should be very clear about this. Okay,

1776
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
first of all

1777
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
culture is not

1778
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
a belief system.

1779
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
I agree. The representation of culture is a belief

1780
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
system. That is not the same thing.

1781
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Culture is what's keeping the electricity

1782
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
on. Okay, and that's not

1783
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
defending us against death anxiety,

1784
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
although it is. It's actually defending us

1785
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
against death, which is much better,

1786
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
right, because we're not sitting outside freezing

1787
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
to death. Right, and that's nothing psychological

1788
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
about that. It's like, there are

1789
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
the lights. It's warm. The floor

1790
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
isn't moving. John isn't attacking me.

1791
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
And, you know,

1792
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
seriously, it's like...

1793
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Right.

1794
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
That's not belief, man. That is that he's not

1795
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
attacking me. And so

1796
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
we represent that belief and that also

1797
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
makes it somewhat

1798
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
pliable and manipulable and fragile

1799
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
because we can also undermine it, but

1800
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
culture protects us from death

1801
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
and the representation of culture

1802
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
protects us sometimes from death anxiety.

1803
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Okay, so now

1804
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Becker also pointed out

1805
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
that there was something else that seemed to give life meaning

1806
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
and that was associated with the Cartesian

1807
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
notion of consciousness. So he thought that

1808
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
people were...

1809
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
apart from being protected from

1810
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
terror, which we needed to be,

1811
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
we also needed to convince ourselves

1812
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
that our lives were worthwhile.

1813
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
And we basically did that by deluding

1814
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
ourselves that we were engaged in some

1815
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
sort of heroic project and

1816
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
somehow we could deceive ourselves well

1817
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
enough about the importance of that, through self-deception

1818
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
mostly, that that also added

1819
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
another layer of meaning to our life.

1820
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Okay, the problem with Becker

1821
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
fundamentally was that he didn't read Jung

1822
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
and he said right in the introduction to his book

1823
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
I've never had any patience for Jung

1824
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
and I never thought he said anything to say about

1825
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
in his books on alchemy and that was

1826
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
really too bad because if he would have read them

1827
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
he would have got the book right instead of wrong.

1828
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
So, so imagine

1829
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
this way instead. So I wrote a paper

1830
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
a while back called Three Kinds of Meaning.

1831
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Okay, so the one

1832
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
meaning is the meaning that announces

1833
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
itself when something that you don't

1834
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
want to have happen happens.

1835
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
It's not exactly what you don't

1836
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
predict because we don't predict

1837
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
we want.

1838
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Now, part of wanting

1839
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
is predicting. But if you think

1840
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
about it as predicting, you don't take into account

1841
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
motivation. It's a huge mistake.

1842
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
We're not like cold, cognitive

1843
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
expectations. No, I agree with that.

1844
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Okay, so sometimes things don't turn out

1845
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
the way we want.

1846
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
That's meaningful. Sometimes

1847
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
the meaning is kind of cool. It's like

1848
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
you make a joke and I didn't expect it. It's like

1849
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
ha ha! And I laugh because I can

1850
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
transcend the unexpected and that's

1851
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
delight in my own capacity for

1852
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
conscious creation, you know. So that feels

1853
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
really good. And I like the joke because

1854
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
of that. So, and that's not an illusion

1855
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
by the way. It's not self-deception.

1856
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
I did transcend the conceptual

1857
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
structure momentarily with you and it's like

1858
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
good for us, you know.

1859
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
So, it's not an illusion.

1860
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Okay, but now and then something goes

1861
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
unexpected in a way, undesired in a way

1862
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
that we don't like. So, for example

1863
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
you find out that your wife

1864
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
has had like six affairs in the last three

1865
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
months and that she's never been faithful

1866
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
to you at all in the last 20 years.

1867
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
It's like

1868
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
that's rough, man.

1869
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Especially if you liked her, you know.

1870
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Ha ha ha!

1871
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Yeah, well, you know, if you didn't

1872
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
like her, it might be good news.

1873
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
But, and I'm actually

1874
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
serious about that too. But okay, so you think

1875
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
well, how upsetting should

1876
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
that be?

1877
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
It's hard for your nervous system to calibrate that,

1878
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
but here's a rough mode

1879
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
of understanding the calibration.

1880
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
The existence

1881
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
of your faithfulness

1882
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
in your spouse is an axiomatic

1883
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
precondition for a set of models

1884
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
that you erect about how the world

1885
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
will lay itself out in

1886
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
a way that you want to. Which is to say

1887
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
you've modeled a future

1888
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
with this person. It's a future you want

1889
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
and then if she's not there

1890
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
or if her faithfulness is absent,

1891
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
that collapses.

1892
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
But what does it collapse into?

1893
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
It collapses into the unstructured void

1894
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
fundamentally. And that's really hard

1895
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
on you. If you're

1896
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
betrayed like that, this is why betrayers

1897
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
occupy the lowest circle of hell, right?

1898
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
If you're betrayed like that, it's even worse.

1899
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Your future's gone

1900
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
and that sucks because you put a lot of work

1901
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
into it probably and you need to stabilize

1902
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
the bad thing because it's rife with uncertainty.

1903
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
But then your present is gone

1904
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
too because who the hell

1905
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
is this person you're living with

1906
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
and more to the point, what kind of moron

1907
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
are you? And so that means

1908
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
your model of the most

1909
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
important person in your life

1910
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
is gone, collapses

1911
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
into the void and you have

1912
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
no idea what the hell's up with you

1913
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
either. How could you be so blind? How could you be

1914
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
so naive? How could you be so foolish? How could

1915
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
you be so gullible?

1916
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
How evil is this person? How evil

1917
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
are you? How did you

1918
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
did you instigate

1919
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
this in some unconscious manner? Were you

1920
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
looking for punishment all along?

1921
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
And then there's the whole problem of your past.

1922
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
It's like whatever you thought it was

1923
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
it isn't. It's something completely different.

1924
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
You didn't know who you were with when you were

1925
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
doing all the things that you thought you were doing.

1926
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
So that's a collapse

1927
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
if you think about this game hierarchy

1928
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
we talked about a

1929
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
the stable marriage part of a game

1930
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
hierarchy is way the hell up the abstraction

1931
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
level. And so

1932
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
it decomposes

1933
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
into a very large subset of operations

1934
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
and perceptions. And when you blow

1935
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
that you basically blow out a huge

1936
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
chunk of the personality.

1937
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
And then what shines through that is the

1938
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
void essentially. It's terror.

1939
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
It's depression.

1940
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
And it's not just psychological

1941
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
because you actually don't know where you are

1942
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
who you're with anymore and so the way your body

1943
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
responds to that is by assuming that you've been

1944
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
drop naked into a pit of lions.

1945
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
And really your cortisol levels go way up

1946
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
your heart rate goes it's like you're in a

1947
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
state of chronic chronic

1948
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
horrible stress physiological stress

1949
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
and that will kill you it's not just psychological

1950
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
it hurts your brain it hurts your immune

1951
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
system makes you diabetic

1952
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
it makes you obese it's you name

1953
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
it it's like cortisol is bad news.

1954
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
So your body is

1955
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
estimating the proportion of the territory

1956
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
that you inhabit that has now become

1957
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
uninhabitable right. And so

1958
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
there's a that's the meaning of chaos

1959
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
that's the meaning of chaos and it's an

1960
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
a prior meaning and a lot of it is

1961
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
you should be frozen in terror

1962
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
like you're looking at the Gorgon's face

1963
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
and the other part of it is

1964
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
how wait a minute there's there's a

1965
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
little treasure there too it's like the

1966
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
dragon with the treasure maybe you can stop

1967
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
living a false life right you can put

1968
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
yourself back together you can start living

1969
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
in truth you can find a relationship that's

1970
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
actually genuine and so that's like the

1971
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
that is precisely that the treasure

1972
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
that the dragon guards that's why we have

1973
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
that story by the way and that's also why

1974
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
it's the oldest human story that

1975
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
we know so

1976
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
I suspected it traces itself

1977
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
all the way back to the time 60 million

1978
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
years ago when we were throwing branches at

1979
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
snakes so it's all that

1980
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
story wasn't a story then right it was

1981
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
a pattern of behavior so

1982
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
there's the meaning of chaos

1983
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
and then there's the meaning of order

1984
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
and the meaning of order is the

1985
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
regulation of chaos just so

1986
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
that the meaning that's useful shines

1987
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
through and it's sort of the kind of

1988
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
idea that Huxley had about consciousness

1989
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
as a reducing valve I think that was Berkeley too

1990
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
right was it Berkeley no Berkeley has a different

1991
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
idea okay okay problem had the same idea

1992
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
okay okay so so that's

1993
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
two meanings meaning of order

1994
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
stable security it can tilt

1995
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
towards tyranny if it gets too much

1996
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
and then there's the meaning of chaos which

1997
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
can be horrifying at high levels of

1998
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
abstraction and interesting at lower levels

1999
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
and then there's one other meaning

2000
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
which is the third class and the third

2001
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
class is the meaning that you experience when you're

2002
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
mediating between order and chaos

2003
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
and that's the that's the heroic

2004
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
meaning it's like you're you've got

2005
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
one foot in order so maybe you've got your

2006
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
scientific theory and you know you're out

2007
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
on the edge of that you're on the frontier

2008
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
the scientific frontier and you're

2009
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
poking your beak out into the unknown

2010
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
and as you're doing that you're seeing new

2011
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
patterns and you're you're incorporating

2012
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
them and you're dissolving

2013
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
and reconstituting the whole structure

2014
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
of the known that that is

2015
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
order and that's that's

2016
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
meaningful delight that's when you're doing

2017
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
that you know you're in the right place and

2018
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
you say well what's the meaning of life it's

2019
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
that's we have three there's the meaning

2020
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
of chaos look out

2021
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
it's promise and catastrophe

2022
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
we have the meaning of order

2023
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
that's security and tyranny

2024
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
and then we have the meaning of exploration

2025
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
and that's the hero

2026
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
myth and it's not a false

2027
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
thing it's not self-deception it's like

2028
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
you're out there transforming

2029
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
chaos into order and that's

2030
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
habitable territory for you and everyone

2031
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
else it's like otherwise

2032
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
it's bloody freezing to death and chewing

2033
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
on bones with the dogs you know it's like

2034
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
we don't want to do that

2035
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
so it's not it's not

2036
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
non real and we also don't know

2037
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
how far we can push it like if all of you

2038
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
stayed properly on the

2039
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
border between it order and chaos

2040
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
and we're attempting to

2041
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
rectify in your environment everything

2042
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
you could in a meaningful way it's like

2043
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
God only knows how much better you could

2044
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
make the world and like I would say

2045
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
that's it that there's an ultimatness

2046
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
about that and the

2047
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
ancient Egyptians had figured this out a very

2048
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
long time ago and it was partly for that

2049
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
reason that they worship the God called Horus

2050
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
who is the eye everybody knows

2051
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
the Egyptian eye and both the Egyptians

2052
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
and the Mesopotamians had figured out that

2053
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
the fundamental attribute

2054
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
of the heroic spirit

2055
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
isn't rationality it's the

2056
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
capacity to pay attention

2057
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
and what's so cool about that that's the

2058
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Cartesian issue right

2059
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
consciousness is the capacity to pay attention

2060
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
and attention looks beyond

2061
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
the pyramid of the known it's the little

2062
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
eye at the top it's looking

2063
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
beyond and it's extending the pyramid

2064
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
and it's transforming the pyramid when it

2065
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
needs to be transformed and everybody

2066
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
can stay safely and nicely it's

2067
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
going inside of that and it stays

2068
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
dynamic so

2069
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
that's really the redemptive meaning

2070
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
I think because

2071
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
you can't be secure

2072
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
you can't

2073
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
you're too fragile and things are too complicated

2074
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
so you can't put your faith in ultimate security

2075
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
that's what totalitarians do

2076
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
and that doesn't work it just turns

2077
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
genocidal so what can you

2078
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
put your faith in

2079
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
well

2080
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
you can put your faith and it's not even

2081
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
faith it's an observable phenomena

2082
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
concentrate

2083
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
on doing things that are meaningful

2084
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
that you can do

2085
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
they'll announce themselves to you it's like

2086
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
you have something's bugging you it's like fix it

2087
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
you'll find that that's quite meaningful

2088
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
so and that meaning redeems you

2089
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
right in that moment because

2090
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
if it's meaningful enough

2091
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
you're not self-conscious

2092
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
and anxious and hurt and suffering and

2093
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
devastated you're like on top

2094
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
of the game and so then you might say

2095
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
well what if you just stayed there all the time

2096
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
well then problem solved

2097
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
so and you might say

2098
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
well no that's fine say it

2099
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
but you could try it

2100
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
that's the thing that's so cool about this it's actually

2101
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
this is kind of an existential argument

2102
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
in some sense it's like

2103
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
you can run the experiment

2104
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
I tell my students all the time

2105
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
watch your life

2106
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
see what you're doing that's really

2107
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
low quality and meaningless

2108
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
that you could just stop doing

2109
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
so you don't have to answer ultimate

2110
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
questions to do that it's like

2111
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
it's not what is truth

2112
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
it's what is falsehood

2113
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
and it's way easier to figure out what falsehood

2114
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
is than truth so if you're doing

2115
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
stupid moronic things that hurt you and your family

2116
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
and you know it and you could stop

2117
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
and you think you might stop

2118
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
which is quite a set of constraints right

2119
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
then stop

2120
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
and then see what happens

2121
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
and the first thing that'll happen is that things will tilt a bit

2122
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
little less chaos

2123
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
little more order little more freedom from you

2124
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
for you

2125
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
so sometimes it's the opposite

2126
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
it's like you've got your family around the neck

2127
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
it's like don't do anything I don't want you to do

2128
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
it's like tyrant you know

2129
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
so then the trick is to loosen up

2130
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
the old tyrant a bit and get a little more chaos

2131
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
in there and that'll optimize the meaning again

2132
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
and so

2133
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
you said right at the beginning of the discussion

2134
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
that meaning wasn't a proposition

2135
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
that's right and I would say well one form

2136
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
of meaning is propositional that's the orderly

2137
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
meaning

2138
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
but the transcendent form of meaning

2139
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
upon which even order depends

2140
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
is the dynamic

2141
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
meaning making

2142
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
but that's what I meant

2143
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
yeah I know I understand that

2144
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
that's what I was trying to convey with this notion

2145
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
that I think is completely

2146
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
accessible to current cognitive science

2147
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
of this evolving relation

2148
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
I mean because

2149
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
one of the key ideas in the Darwinian model

2150
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
is you integrate

2151
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
you have the chaos

2152
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
you have the opening up of the variations

2153
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
that are often due to mutation

2154
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
and random events

2155
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
and then you have natural selection

2156
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
that is the ordering that's the selection process

2157
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
and then what evolution means

2158
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
is exactly this constant interplay

2159
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
between them and that's what I meant

2160
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
when I think cognition is not

2161
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
a set of beliefs in our head

2162
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
it's the brain's ongoing

2163
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
evolved fittedness to the world

2164
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
and I do think

2165
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
I agree with you that

2166
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
learning to

2167
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
learn what it is to be a wise person

2168
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
is to learn to situate yourself

2169
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
in such a way that that relationship

2170
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
becomes very attuned

2171
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
it becomes very self-propellant

2172
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
it's

2173
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
I think

2174
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
you went to Egyptian

2175
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
but I think it's what Socrates meant when he said

2176
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
wisdom begins in wonder

2177
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
at the point about

2178
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
when we're in a state of wonder

2179
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
and Descartes actually

2180
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
contrary to what a lot of people thought about Descartes

2181
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
we're different from the other animals because we're not

2182
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
motivated just by fear and desire

2183
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
we're motivated also by wonder and that's what makes us unique

2184
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
because wonder is about

2185
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
being on that horizon of intelligibility

2186
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
that moving horizon

2187
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
which behind us

2188
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
is what has been confirmed

2189
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
but in front of us is what has not been explored

2190
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
yes

2191
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
so I do think that

2192
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
that's the Taoist symbol

2193
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
as you know I am a Taoist

2194
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
I practice Tai Chi

2195
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
I do challenge the idea

2196
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
well maybe you used the term a little bit different

2197
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
I do challenge the idea that that is

2198
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
not a rational state

2199
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
I think we have reduced the notion of

2200
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
rationality too much to logical

2201
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
argumentation so for example

2202
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
I would say that the Buddhist notion of mindfulness

2203
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
of reflecting

2204
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
on how we pay attention

2205
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
so that we make it more reliably capable

2206
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
of putting us on that

2207
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
so that we more reliably

2208
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
flourish and achieve our goals

2209
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
is as much a form

2210
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
a cognitive style of rationality

2211
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
as good logical argumentation is

2212
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
precisely because by

2213
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
being on learning how to

2214
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
structure your attention so reliably

2215
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
keeps you on the horizon

2216
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
of wonder is precisely to place yourself

2217
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
in the optimal place for

2218
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
flourishing as a human being that constitutes

2219
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
I think for me a fundamental kind of rationality

2220
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
and we're again giving into the

2221
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
romantic notion that there's this deep

2222
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
dichotomy between you know

2223
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
attention and experience and logic and rationality

2224
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
we should abandon that dichotomy

2225
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
and we should see

2226
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
that there is as much rationality

2227
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
right going on

2228
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
in you know the training of mindfulness

2229
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
as there is in the rationality

2230
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
of training logical argumentation

2231
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
so let look I

2232
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
appreciate what you're saying but I want to point out

2233
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
well let me say because

2234
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
rationality ultimately comes from

2235
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
ratio from rationing it's fundamentally

2236
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
about the logistical distribution

2237
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
of your resources for success

2238
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
right as a human being it's not

2239
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
primarily about

2240
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
the logical ordering of your inferences

2241
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
that's just one way in which we ration

2242
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
one type of our cognitive resource

2243
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
but it is not our most fundamental resource

2244
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
look our behavior is

2245
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
not ultimately and primarily

2246
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
driven by our beliefs beliefs

2247
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
matter they affect our behavior but there's all this

2248
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
stuff outside or below our beliefs

2249
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
that is driving our behavior and what

2250
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
gets most access to that

2251
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
is not our beliefs but what we find salient

2252
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
what we find relevant to bring it back

2253
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
to what I was saying before

2254
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
yes but

2255
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
this is why I want to make this

2256
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
this and like

2257
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
we're circulating around the same set of ideas

2258
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
but there's an important point of clarification

2259
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
here I think

2260
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
so one of the things that you

2261
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
probably all know is that the Catholic

2262
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
church was very skeptical about

2263
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
rationality right and modern

2264
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
people are not very happy about that

2265
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
because they think of that as anti-science

2266
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
in a sense and the sign of

2267
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
like a what a degenerate institution

2268
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
and yeah yeah you can understand that

2269
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
but they had a reason

2270
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
and I figured out this reason when I was studying

2271
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
um

2272
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Paradise Lost right and the reason was this

2273
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
so the book Paradise Lost

2274
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
came out when

2275
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
it's the great home by John Milton came out

2276
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
roughly speaking when the nation states

2277
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
in Europe were really starting to get going

2278
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
and political ideologies were really

2279
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
trying to starting to structure themselves

2280
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
so they were like secular belief systems

2281
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
and the way I read Milton is that

2282
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
so Lucifer, Satan

2283
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
and Milton's Paradise Lost is

2284
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
he's Lucifer so he's the highest

2285
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
spirit in God's heavenly hierarchy

2286
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
so to speak and he's the bringer of light

2287
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
right and Satan

2288
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
like satanic arrogance is a rational

2289
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
arrogance

2290
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
so what does that mean exactly

2291
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
well let's look at the Soviet Union

2292
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
what happened in the Soviet Union with the communists

2293
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
was that they set up a system

2294
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
of axioms such as from each

2295
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
according to his ability to each according

2296
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
to his need which sound lovely

2297
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
axiomatically true right so

2298
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
their fundamental beliefs

2299
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
and then they erected a rational system

2300
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
on the basis of those axiomatic beliefs

2301
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
that was completely coherent and

2302
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
closed and then they worshiped

2303
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
the ability to make that absolutely coherent

2304
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
and not

2305
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
to have any necessity of stepping

2306
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
outside of it in fact if you stepped outside

2307
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
of it with your own suffering

2308
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
instead of taking into account the fact

2309
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
that your suffering meant that the totalitarian

2310
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
viewpoint was incomplete they just

2311
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
killed you that I was a lot easier

2312
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
than fixing the damn thing and so

2313
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
what Milton intuited was that

2314
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
the rational spirit which is the intelligence

2315
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
of human beings the rational

2316
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
and propositional based intelligence that

2317
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
wants coherence and rigor

2318
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
could be stretched to

2319
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
such a degree that it became a replacement

2320
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
for appreciation of the transcendent

2321
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
which would be the thing outside

2322
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
the known it just replaces that and that's

2323
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
the satanic appropriation

2324
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
of the highest heaven

2325
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
in God's heavenly kingdom

2326
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
you know and Milton's prediction

2327
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
about that was that that turned

2328
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
the rational mind into something that would

2329
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
inevitably rule over hell

2330
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
well that's what happened

2331
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
in the 20th century now

2332
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
I think I don't think

2333
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
rationality is the right term exactly

2334
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
and maybe attention isn't the right

2335
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
term either although I think it's closer

2336
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
I think the right term is logos

2337
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
and logos of course

2338
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
is the root of logic but it's also

2339
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
the root of the idea it's a Christian

2340
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
idea fundamentally although it's expressed

2341
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
in many other religious beliefs

2342
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
of the creative capacity

2343
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
of the investigative

2344
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
creative spirit right so

2345
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
it's investigation and it's the

2346
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
transformation of the consequence of the

2347
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
investigation into fully articulated

2348
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
representation and then it's the sharing

2349
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
of that and so what we're doing

2350
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
right now this is a logos conversation

2351
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
because you're not trying

2352
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
to impose your propositions on me

2353
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
and I'm not trying to impose my propositions

2354
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
on you what we're trying to do

2355
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
is to use the structures that we both have

2356
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
the propositional structures to dance

2357
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
with them and out of the dance

2358
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
to produce something that's

2359
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
emergent and that's dynamic and that's

2360
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
living it's the living spirit

2361
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
actually that's living that's appropriate

2362
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
it's it's historically

2363
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
grounded and precisely appropriate

2364
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
to this time and place

2365
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
and that's the logos and so

2366
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
that's why in complex

2367
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
especially in complex western systems although not

2368
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
only in them the logos

2369
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
is the thing that's not only at the top

2370
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
of the hierarchy of value but it's also

2371
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
the thing that brings order out

2372
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
of chaos at the beginning of time

2373
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
okay I would agree with that you'd be

2374
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
pleased to know that when I talk about this level

2375
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
of the brain

2376
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
and mind in my courses I use the term logos

2377
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
to label it so

2378
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
my students can vouch for me on that

2379
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
and I do agree

2380
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
but I would also point out

2381
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
that logos is also the basis

2382
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
of the word logistical which again is about

2383
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
the distribution of resources

2384
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
right right right absolutely

2385
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
and so what I was proposing to you

2386
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
is that

2387
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
that a Socratic

2388
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
I mean whatever else Socrates

2389
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
was I mean he was open to the transcendent

2390
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
in a very important way

2391
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
but he was also

2392
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
that's why he knew that

2393
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
his not knowing was the most important thing he knew

2394
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
but he did know but see people forget

2395
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
that although Socrates said he didn't

2396
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
know in that sense he said he knew

2397
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
that he did not knew that doesn't mean that he was just ignorant

2398
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
he meant he had what Nicholas of Cusa

2399
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
called learned ignorance he had an inside

2400
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
knowledge of the way in which

2401
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
an inside awareness of the way in which

2402
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
he was limited and

2403
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
and faulted but

2404
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Socrates did claim to know some things

2405
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
he claimed to know Ta Erotica

2406
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
which didn't mean he was some sort of

2407
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
sexual master

2408
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
he meant he knew what to care about

2409
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
he knew what to find significant

2410
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
he knew that the

2411
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
unexamined life was not worth living

2412
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
and he knew that to such a degree that he was willing to

2413
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
die for that so there

2414
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
was a kind of knowing that he talked about

2415
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
but again it's this

2416
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
knowing about again what to care about

2417
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
what to find relevant what

2418
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
you should what you should direct

2419
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
towards and he saw argumentation

2420
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
not as something antithetical

2421
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
to that process

2422
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
but as something that could deeply support it

2423
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
the Socratic process of

2424
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Alancas and argumentation was not

2425
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
antithetical to that

2426
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
logos the Deo logos but exactly

2427
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
meant to be constitutive

2428
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
and enhancement enhancing

2429
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
of that very transformation of what

2430
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
we fundamentally care about and what we find

2431
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
most significant and I think it's been a mistake

2432
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
again due to the romantics

2433
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
because most of our mistakes are due to them

2434
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
don't forget the

2435
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
postmodernists

2436
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
fine

2437
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
but what I

2438
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
this putting on

2439
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
one side of argumentation

2440
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
and then putting on the other

2441
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
the other side caring and emotion

2442
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
I mean what's going on in cognitive science

2443
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
right now is exactly I mean

2444
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
neuroscientists like Demasio

2445
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
or Montague were saying

2446
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
this is a false dichotomy that we have

2447
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
saddled ourselves with too long

2448
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
you cannot be a rational being if you're not

2449
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
also a deeply emotional being

2450
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
and you can't be an emotional being

2451
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
if you're not a being that is

2452
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
in some sense doing relevance realisation

2453
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
and rationing its resources

2454
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
they are interdependent

2455
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
and equally interdefining

2456
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
and I think that again ultimately goes to the

2457
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
fact that relevance realisation is not

2458
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
cold calculation it is ultimately

2459
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
also deeply right

2460
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
effective arousing

2461
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
it's salient and again

2462
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
this is what we're trying to do

2463
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
when we talk about the meaning in life

2464
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
we're trying to find

2465
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
those ways

2466
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
of behaving and seeing

2467
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
and paying attention that are rational

2468
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
in the socratic sense

2469
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
of affording that interrelationship

2470
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
between argumentation

2471
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
and caring that again

2472
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
puts us on the horizon

2473
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
of intelligibility puts us in that place

2474
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
where wonder and

2475
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
a flow of insight becomes a primary way

2476
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
into which we try to adaptively respond

2477
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
to a world that will always

2478
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
be beyond our

2479
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
complete cognitive grasp

2480
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
put her there

2481
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
that's good

2482
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
so that seems

2483
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
to be a good end to the

2484
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
debate I think we can

2485
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
we've got about 10 minutes so

2486
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
it might be a good idea to

2487
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
incorporate some of the ideas from the audience

2488
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
I'd like to say one thing first

2489
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
I gave

2490
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
credit to work the idea with Leo Ferraro

2491
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
I also want to point out that a lot of these

2492
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
ideas have not worked out in

2493
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
isolation

2494
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
my good friend Chris master

2495
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
right there is a co-author of a book

2496
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
on a lot of these issues and he's been

2497
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
a co-author in a true sense

2498
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
and so I want to give him credit for some

2499
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
of the arguments and ideas we've often worked

2500
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
these out together

2501
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
it seems like both of you

2502
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
have arrived at the conclusion that

2503
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
a sort of self-reflective

2504
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
disposition that

2505
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
adapts meeting structures

2506
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
dynamically while you live

2507
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
is how you generate proper

2508
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
meeting structures

2509
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
I would like to offer you something to think about

2510
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
this is like a leap way the hell up

2511
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
the abstraction chain

2512
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
you've all seen Pinocchio I presume yes

2513
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
how many have seen Pinocchio

2514
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
you know you're watching like animated

2515
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
drawings of some puppet

2516
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
rescuing his father from a whale right

2517
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
it's like what the hell are you up to by the way

2518
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
so you might think about that for a minute

2519
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
you go into the theater and you watch that

2520
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
and you think oh yeah it's like there's a puppet

2521
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
and you know he goes to an island and then he dives into the ocean

2522
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
with a cricket and then he finds his father in a whale

2523
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
and then a fairy changes him into a boy

2524
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
that all makes sense

2525
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
it's like well no actually

2526
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
it doesn't make any sense at all and what's even

2527
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
more interesting is that you actually don't care

2528
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
whether it makes any sense and that you'd be annoyed

2529
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
at anyone who would point it out

2530
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
so one of the things I would like to point out is that

2531
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
the fundamental theme of Pinocchio is that

2532
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
if you don't rescue

2533
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
your father which is order

2534
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
by the way from the bottom of the sea

2535
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
which is chaos then you can't

2536
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
become a genuine human being

2537
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
and you know we show that to

2538
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
our kids because we know it's true but we're not

2539
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
smart enough to understand it

2540
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
so truly we act out

2541
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
and represent symbolically many things

2542
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
that we cannot articulate and that's in fact

2543
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
what art is for but you know

2544
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
you might walk away from this thinking

2545
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
well you don't believe this sort of thing

2546
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
it's like no you might think that you don't believe it

2547
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
but if you

2548
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
watch how you act you believe it

2549
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
and the only thing you should ever do

2550
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
when you're trying to figure out what someone believes

2551
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
is watch how they act because what they say

2552
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
about themselves is a very

2553
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
pale reflection generally speaking

2554
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
of the actuality that

2555
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
they themselves are

2556
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
you do not comprehend yourself obviously

2557
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
because we wouldn't even need this discussion

2558
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
but

2559
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
well I'll leave it at that

2560
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
I wanted to point that out because the sorts of things

2561
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
that we're talking about are being broadcast

2562
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
at you in many ways all the time

2563
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
and you know the themes

2564
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
what 20th and 21st century philosophy

2565
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
and cognitive science are trying to do

2566
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
when they're doing the deepest thing they can do

2567
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
is to raise these

2568
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
these forms

2569
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
of knowledge that we've acquired

2570
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
over God only knows

2571
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
what length of time up from the depths

2572
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
and to make them articulate

2573
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
and to help us become real and to realize

2574
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
ourselves and like that is the solution

2575
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
to the problem of life in so far

2576
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
as there is a solution

2577
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
and it may well be a sufficient solution

2578
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
socrates thought it was a sufficient solution

2579
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
I agree

2580
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
he felt that his identification

2581
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
with the logos process

2582
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
roughly speaking had given his life so much meaning

2583
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
in depth that when the gods

2584
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
offered him the chance to shuffle off the mortal coil

2585
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
he went and had a little colloquy

2586
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
with his conscience his daemon

2587
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
which was basically logos

2588
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
and it said good job old man

2589
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
maybe it's

2590
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
luck for you you can drink the hemlock

2591
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
you say goodbye to all your friends

2592
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
and all Alzheimer's and the degeneration

2593
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
of your being

2594
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
sayonara and that's why socrates

2595
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
went through the trial and you know

2596
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
we know that story and we know it for a bloody

2597
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
reason it's like he's at the base

2598
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
of our thought structures along with other people

2599
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
so

2600
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
socrates means a great deal to me

2601
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
socrates means a great deal to me

2602
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
socrates means a great deal to me

2603
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
socrates means a great deal to me

2604
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
so there seems to be

2605
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
at least one solution to try to pursue

2606
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
life dan dolderman poses an interesting question

2607
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
which is how can people

2608
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
overcome their resistance to the crushing

2609
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
responsibility that comes with confronting

2610
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
the meeting crisis? Well that's easy

2611
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
try to comprehend the alternative

2612
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
you know you're either aiming for heaven or you're

2613
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
going to end up in hell and it'll happen while

2614
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
you're alive I don't have any idea what'll

2615
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
happen afterwards but like you can see

2616
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
people in hell all the time you just have to

2617
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
look around and so you're either on

2618
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
the path and moving forward and upward and

2619
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
aiming at the right thing or

2620
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
backsliding backwards into a place

2621
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
that is properly conceptualized as

2622
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
eternal and punishing it's like

2623
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
that's no problem so the way

2624
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
you motivate yourself partly is by thinking

2625
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
well do you really want more suffering and misery

2626
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
in the world or do you want less

2627
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
you know and that's basically the decision

2628
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
that we made at the Nuremberg trials right

2629
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
way back at the end of World War II

2630
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
is it wrong to inflict pointless

2631
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
pain and suffering on people for aesthetic

2632
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
purposes

2633
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
and the answer was well

2634
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
yeah okay good we got hell specified

2635
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
that's good

2636
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
so you think well the opposite of that

2637
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
whatever is the opposite of that well we don't know

2638
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
that's what you're pursuing unless you were

2639
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
like pretty fond of what happened with the Nazis

2640
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
you know so

2641
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
you motivate yourself by

2642
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
running away from the most awful thing

2643
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
there is towards the thing that's the best

2644
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
that could possibly be

2645
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
and it's up to you to decide what those things

2646
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
are I mean you're an independent

2647
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
being with all sorts of ability it's like

2648
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
solve the problems you can solve

2649
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
like more power to you

2650
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
I've got my problems I'm going to solve

2651
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
them and hopefully jointly

2652
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
all of us we can make this

2653
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
place that's fragmented and flawed

2654
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
and decrepit and trouble and beauty

2655
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
and all of that into a place that's

2656
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
as good as we can imagine

2657
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
anyways and we should adopt

2658
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
the responsibility to do that because the alternative

2659
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
you think that

2660
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
responsibility is miserable

2661
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
is you try your responsibility

2662
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
just see what happens

2663
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
so that's

2664
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
that's my answer to that problem

2665
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
can I have the question I'd get please

2666
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
because I don't I think I have a

2667
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
I'm not going to challenge what Jordan says

2668
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
but I think I want to answer a different aspect

2669
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
of Dan's question

2670
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
how can people overcome the resistance to the

2671
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
crushing responsibility that comes with confronting

2672
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
the means

2673
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
so I think you can make a moral argument like Jordan has

2674
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
and I think that's valuable but

2675
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
part of what he was

2676
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
part of what's being implied there

2677
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
is that

2678
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
the question is more about

2679
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
how to enable people

2680
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
and what I would answer

2681
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
I hope that's a fair thing to say

2682
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
Dan's nodding so that's a good sign

2683
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
I

2684
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
would say there that and this is again

2685
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
to fall back on to Socrates and Plato

2686
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
and give me

2687
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
a moment here because I'm going to say something that might be

2688
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
a little bit at first

2689
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
Plato talked about the fact that people

2690
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
have to be seduced into transcendence

2691
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
and

2692
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
that word kind of strikes us off because we don't like

2693
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
the notion of seduction but what he meant by that

2694
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
is you it's like you can't it's like

2695
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
you have to sometimes tell your kids just do

2696
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
this and then once you've done

2697
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
it you will know why it was

2698
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
important to do it you have to go through

2699
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
the transformation in order to understand

2700
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
why the transformation is valuable to you

2701
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
now typically people just

2702
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
know right and so what you want to do

2703
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
is you want you want to

2704
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
give some form of behavior to people

2705
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
from where

2706
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
that's inside the box they're in

2707
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
that they like to do inside the box

2708
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
but has this little time bomb

2709
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
in it and Jesus of Nazareth was

2710
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
a master at these kinds of time bombs

2711
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
and they were called parables you tell this story like

2712
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
oh I know what this story is

2713
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
but it has this little explosive thing in the center

2714
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
of it that's a snake

2715
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
okay well whatever

2716
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
and the point I'm trying to make is

2717
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
you give people

2718
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
certain psychotechnologies certain techniques

2719
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
and you say you know this will

2720
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
help do this this will help

2721
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
you do this this will help you know solve

2722
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
you know some of your own more practical problems

2723
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
this will make you more insightful

2724
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
this will make you a little bit more cognitively flexible

2725
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
but then what you've also

2726
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
what you've actually done is you've also

2727
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
prepared them

2728
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
in two ways you've

2729
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
prepared them to actually extend that

2730
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
machinery because it has a momentum in it

2731
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
and start to ask the question for themselves

2732
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
and you've also enabled them

2733
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
to act to respond to the question

2734
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
in a more challenging form

2735
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
and then if you can keep doing that

2736
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
with them in a kind of Socratic dance

2737
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
you can you can draw

2738
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
and this is what was meant by the seduction metaphor

2739
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
you can draw people into

2740
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
a very deep kind of responsibility

2741
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
without having them at any point

2742
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
confront a kind of crushing

2743
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
clash and I mean in that sense

2744
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
and I don't mean this in a patronizing sense

2745
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
it is very much like good parenting

2746
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
right yourself

2747
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
yes of yourself whoever you're trying to help

2748
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
confront

2749
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
the meaning crisis

2750
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
without as Dan is saying

2751
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
sort of just dropping this nightmare on them

2752
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
so that's how I would try

2753
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
I want to elaborate on that a little bit

2754
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
because you know John brought up

2755
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
this other idea about parables

2756
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
and so I want to tell you about a meta parable

2757
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
because the parables that Christ

2758
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
laid out were embedded

2759
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
in a meta parable

2760
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
and the meta parable

2761
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
what expanded itself

2762
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
over 2000 years into Christianity

2763
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
essentially and so although it has its roots

2764
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
far before Christianity emerged

2765
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
so John said

2766
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
you know you throw someone a little box

2767
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
and you say transform within it

2768
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
it's like okay fine so I would say the way you do that

2769
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
is like we said this earlier

2770
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
pick a problem that bugs you

2771
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
that's why Jiminy Cricket is an insect by the way

2772
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
pick a problem that bugs you

2773
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
that you could solve

2774
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
and solve it

2775
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
now what Piaget would say

2776
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
that in order to do that

2777
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
you're going to have to take some of the presuppositions

2778
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
that you're using locally in that box

2779
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
let them die

2780
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
that's a kind of sacrifice

2781
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
and then

2782
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
generate a little local chaos

2783
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
and then pop up a new solution

2784
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
and so that's a small death and rebirth

2785
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
and so the reason that the parables

2786
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
are tested inside the story of death and rebirth

2787
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
is because the idea

2788
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
is that the way that you get to the kingdom of heaven

2789
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
so to speak

2790
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
is to allow yourself to die

2791
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
and be reborn and so you should have faith

2792
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
in the part of yourself that can undergo

2793
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
a disilutive process

2794
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
in preparation

2795
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
for a rebirth and that can happen

2796
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
at multiple levels of analysis

2797
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
micro levels which is where you should start

2798
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
man start at the micro levels

2799
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
fix what's at hand

2800
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
and then if you get good at that

2801
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
you can start moving up the abstraction chain

2802
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
and you know if you get all the way to the top

2803
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
which you won't because you can't

2804
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
then the deaths and rebirths are very very

2805
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
profound and significant

2806
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
well that's a metaphor in many ways

2807
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
and I don't know how far it extends

2808
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
I mean it extends in long ways

2809
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
but that is part of what

2810
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
that drama and it is a drama

2811
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
is trying to teach us about ourselves

2812
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
we formulated the drama

2813
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
to tell us who we are

2814
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
you know and so

2815
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
I like that

2816
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
I really like that

2817
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
you just said about the meta parable

2818
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
and Christ exemplifying a parable

2819
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
as a background thing

2820
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
to ground his spoken parables

2821
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
that's quite brilliant well done

2822
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
thank you it only took me like 35 years

2823
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
to think of it

2824
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
well better you than me because I benefit from that

2825
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
I mean that's great

2826
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
I mean that's really good that's very good

2827
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
I think

2828
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
and I think

2829
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
you're noticing about disillusion

2830
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
affording you know this is

2831
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
you know this is dynamical systems theory

2832
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
it's also what the shaman do

2833
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
yes of course

2834
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
and I was also saying

2835
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
that I think it's prevalent also

2836
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
in the platonic metaphor

2837
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
of people who are attracted

2838
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
in the cave and they've been trapped

2839
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
so that they're always looking at the shadows

2840
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
and hearing the echoes and they have to make their way out

2841
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
and they make their way a little bit

2842
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
they make their eyes accommodate

2843
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
and then that allows them to go a little bit farther

2844
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
and then that blinds them

2845
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
and then their eyes accommodate

2846
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
and then that affords them to go a little bit farther

2847
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
and you do the ascension

2848
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
you do the anagogy out towards

2849
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
where you're in the real world

2850
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
looking at the sun

2851
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
and I think that's the way you do it with people

2852
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
well and then once you've looked at the sun

2853
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
you take the light home and you distribute it

2854
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
to people who are in the dark

2855
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
well the problem as Plato said is when you go back down

2856
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
day two if you go back

2857
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
I mean Plato said it first way before man for man

2858
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
you're blinded by the light

2859
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
but if you go back too soon

2860
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
they're going to kill you

2861
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
like they kill Socrates

2862
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
so then there's just as much

2863
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
problem

2864
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
of responsibility

2865
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
on the teacher

2866
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
as there is on the people being taught

2867
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
they can suffer also a kind of catastrophic

2868
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
event

2869
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
if they come back down from the sun

2870
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
I'm not putting myself in that place of enlightenment

2871
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
but you know what I'm trying to say

2872
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
I'm pretty much done

2873
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
that's our time

2874
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
good work

2875
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
congratulations
