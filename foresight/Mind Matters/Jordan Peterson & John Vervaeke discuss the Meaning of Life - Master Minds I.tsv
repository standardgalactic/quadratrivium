0	11000	What does the word meaning denote in the expression meaning of life?
11000	17000	Is it a directive, a feeling, or something else entirely?
17000	24000	Well, I think it's not a straightforward manner to discuss the meaning of life, right?
24000	27000	Because it's pretty clear that there are multiple meanings,
27000	31000	and those meanings are associated with different events and situations.
31000	36000	I think you can still intelligently address the issue of the meaning of life,
36000	41000	because meanings tend to arrange themselves into a hierarchy of value and relevance,
41000	48000	and they have to do that because otherwise there's nothing but, as William James suggested,
48000	51000	sort of a blooming and buzzing confusion.
51000	56000	So the issue is multiple meanings in a unified, integrated framework.
56000	61000	Meaning is partly an impetus for action.
61000	66000	It's very important to remember that human beings are active and living creatures,
66000	70000	and that one of our primary problems, in fact, perhaps our primary problem,
70000	72000	is how to act in the world.
72000	78000	But that also involves other questions like how to perceive, how to prepare for action,
78000	81000	how to plan for action in the future.
81000	85000	And so all of those questions are associated with meaning.
85000	90000	For me, meaning is the abstract impetus towards action, fundamentally.
90000	93000	And it's an important thing to give some consideration to,
93000	100000	because part of the Western intellectual tradition tends to abstract rationality
100000	105000	or consciousness from embodiment, and it's very much the case that we are embodied creatures.
105000	109000	The idea that our brain is in our head and that our mind is in our brain,
109000	117000	it's a useful idea for certain purposes, but it obscures much while shedding light on other things.
117000	123000	So meaning is tightly associated with action, with the abstraction of action,
123000	127000	but then also with the construction of the perceptual frameworks and emotional responses
127000	134000	that are necessary to conceive of the world in a manner that allows you to act in it.
134000	138000	So one of the things we know, for example, is that when you walk into a room like this
138000	143000	and you see the furniture of the landscape arrayed in front of you,
143000	148000	that one of the things that you directly perceive is actually the meaning of that furniture.
148000	151000	And you might think that you see the object and infer the meaning,
151000	156000	and that's what you would think if you were a traditional Western rationalist or even a materialist,
156000	160000	but it actually seems to be the case that when you walk into a room like this,
160000	165000	the room tells you what to do at a level that's below conscious realization,
165000	168000	and it's partly because, well, you know exactly what chairs are for.
168000	171000	You might ask yourself, for example, what is a chair?
171000	175000	It's a complicated question because it could be a beanbag and it could be a stump,
175000	178000	but fundamentally a chair is something to sit in,
178000	184000	and when you see a chair, the chair tells you directly as a perceptual consequence that you sit in it,
184000	186000	and that's the meaning of the chair.
186000	193000	And so you can't understand meaning in that manner without considering meaning in relationship to embodiment.
193000	197000	And so meaning is really how we propel ourselves through the world
197000	201000	and how we organize ourselves and arrange to propel ourselves through the world
201000	208000	in a manner that's productive, relatively free of suffering, even though that's a meaning,
208000	212000	and sustainable across many situations and contexts.
212000	216000	So that's a rough framework for the initiation of the discussion.
219000	224000	For me, I think the first thing I would say is that word meaning is being used as a metaphor.
224000	230000	We're taking basically a term from language, a sentence is meaningful,
230000	237000	and we're using it metaphorically to try to denote something that is probably pre-linguistic,
237000	239000	although it shows up in our language.
239000	243000	A sentence is meaningful in that it does something to information
243000	248000	in such a way that we get a fundamental connection between ourselves and the world.
248000	253000	And I think that's, for me, what is fundamentally going on when we talk about meaning.
253000	258000	We're talking about the fact that there's a fundamental process of selection
258000	263000	that the brain, the embodied brain, which I agree with you is a very important thing
263000	266000	to constantly remind ourselves of, has to face.
266000	269000	There's way too much information available at all times,
269000	276000	and of all of that information, only some of it is going to be useful or helpful to an organism.
276000	279000	And somehow that information has to be found.
279000	282000	It has to be found in a very reliable manner.
282000	289000	It has to be transformed into a form that is relevant to this body in this world,
289000	297000	such that I can frame problems, solve problems, achieve my goals.
297000	303000	And that process of zeroing in on relevant information, what I call relevance realization,
303000	311000	means that we are fundamentally thrown into a atmospheric kind of relationship to the world.
311000	316000	There's a salience landscape constantly being projected at all times of how things stand out to you,
316000	322000	what gathers your attention, what arouses your metabolic resources or dampens them,
322000	326000	what creates certain motivational and affective states.
326000	332000	Because this relevance realization process is not a cold calculation, like a computer.
332000	337000	It's instead a deep involvement between the organism and its world.
337000	344000	And that involvement has, as Jordan says, it's often and most prominently going on below consciousness,
344000	347000	and it's an ongoing, evolving process.
347000	349000	I mean, one minute something is salient.
349000	352000	Look, that became salient to you, now it's not salient anymore.
352000	354000	So that process is constantly evolving.
354000	357000	And so we shouldn't think of meaning as a static thing,
357000	362000	but this ongoing process by which the organism is constantly fitting itself to the world
362000	368000	and having the world fitted to it so that its actions can be undertaken in a fluent manner.
368000	372000	Now the thing that I think is very important about this,
372000	377000	meaning making process, or as I prefer to call it, relevance realization,
377000	380000	because I think meaning is standing in as a metaphor for that,
380000	387000	is that this process is, it's below our consciousness, it's below our rationality,
387000	391000	it's below our language use, it's below our deliberative reasoning,
391000	395000	precisely because it's constitutive or presupposed by all those processes.
395000	398000	Until you do relevance realization, you can't use a language.
398000	401000	Until you do relevance realization, you can't form representations.
401000	406000	Until you do relevance realization, you can't even form your own autobiographical identity.
406000	413000	The world as a place that has categories and you as a cognitive agent with a sense of identity in it,
413000	416000	both co-spring from this relevance realization.
416000	420000	It is a deep binding of you and the world at a fundamental level.
420000	423000	And that's why when it's threatened in any fashion,
423000	429000	human beings will experience a deep kind of trauma, absurdity, horror, a deep kind of anxiety.
429000	432000	And so when I think people are talking about meaning in life,
432000	435000	what they're trying to gesture towards is they have structures in place
435000	441000	that maintain and enhance that relevance realization such that two things are possible.
441000	446000	They can reliably keep at bay absurdity and horror,
446000	452000	and they can reliably afford the ongoing evolution, the growth of that relevance realization
452000	456000	so that they can find some kind of fulfillment in that identity
456000	459000	that they are cultivating for themselves as a cognitive agent
459000	463000	and the world into which they are fitted.
463000	466000	And so I think the degree to which people are talking about meaning in life
466000	469000	is the degree to which they're talking about those kinds of structures
469000	475000	that affect that co-creation out of relevance realization of cognitive agency
475000	480000	and a world in which cognitive agents can solve problems in an intelligible manner.
480000	485000	We should also maybe decide if we agree on something.
485000	488000	We're going to agree on many things, I suppose.
488000	492000	And a lot of a discussion like this is often terminological
492000	494000	and it's partly going to be the case between John and I
494000	497000	because his intellectual background is different than mine,
497000	499000	although it overlaps in some important ways.
499000	503000	And so partly what I'm hoping to do with the discussion tonight
503000	506000	is to make sure that we actually understand each other.
506000	509000	This is definitely not a debate in which one of us is going to win.
509000	513000	What we're hoping to do is to have the kind of conversation
513000	516000	that allows for the scaffolding and the further development of ideas,
516000	519000	which is really what an intellectual conversation is.
519000	522000	So I want to offer you a couple of propositions
522000	524000	and tell me what you think about them.
524000	527000	The first thing is that I don't believe that the question
527000	530000	does life have meaning is actually a reasonable question.
530000	532000	I don't think it's properly formulated.
532000	534000	And the reason I believe that is because
534000	539000	that isn't really what people want to know when they ask that question.
539000	541000	Life has lots of meanings.
541000	543000	The Buddhists would say that life is suffering.
543000	546000	And you know, we might not think about suffering as meaning,
546000	548000	but fundamentally it's anxiety and pain
548000	551000	and with some disgust thrown in there maybe for good measure.
551000	553000	And those are meanings.
553000	556000	And even if you're nihilistic and you're not oriented towards
556000	559000	a belief in some sort of ultimate meaning structure,
559000	561000	that doesn't mean you can escape from the meaning of life.
561000	564000	What it does mean is that the meaning of your life is misery,
564000	567000	suffering, anxiety, and a real decrement and quality.
567000	571000	So we're trapped inside the question of the meaning of life.
571000	573000	There's no getting outside of it.
573000	575000	You can say there's no ultimate meaning,
575000	577000	but then you have to define ultimate.
577000	579000	And then the other thing that I thought...
579000	581000	So let me just make sure I got the first proposition.
581000	583000	The first proposition is the question,
583000	585000	I want to make sure I got your wording right,
585000	587000	does life have a meaning as opposed?
587000	589000	I just want to store that.
589000	592000	I can either respond or wait until you put your second question out.
593000	595000	Yeah, yeah.
595000	597000	I just don't want to lose the first question.
597000	600000	The other thing that might be useful, clarifying,
600000	603000	I understand what you mean by relevance realization.
603000	607000	I have a formulation of it in my own language,
607000	610000	so I'm going to make a couple of comments on that as well,
610000	613000	and you can tell me if you agree or disagree on that.
613000	616000	So one of the things that's quite...
616000	620000	One of the ways that you can approach the idea of meaning
620000	622000	is by making a separate assumption
622000	625000	about what the fundamental structures in the world are.
625000	627000	I mean, materialists and empiricists
627000	629000	tend to believe that the fundamental structures are,
629000	631000	we'll say, atomic particles,
631000	634000	even though we know we can go higher resolution than that.
634000	636000	There's atomic particles and there's this space
636000	638000	in which they're distributed,
638000	642000	and what that means is that the combination of quantum particles,
642000	644000	quantized particles plus space,
644000	649000	allows for the array of physical entities in patterns.
649000	651000	Like music is a pattern,
651000	655000	and there seems to me that there's something profoundly similar
655000	658000	about patterns and information,
658000	661000	and it seems to me that what we experience as meaning
661000	665000	is something like our interaction with information.
665000	667000	Now, I just want to say one more thing about that.
667000	669000	The problem with information in some sense
669000	671000	is that there's too much of it.
671000	673000	So one of the things you could say about life's meaning
673000	676000	is that there's absolutely way too much of it.
676000	678000	You can certainly experience that
678000	680000	if you ever have an experience of awe,
680000	683000	or even of overwhelming absurdity.
683000	686000	Those are both quasi-religious experiences.
686000	690000	So relevance realization is actually, as far as I can tell,
690000	692000	it's the limitation of what's essentially
692000	695000	an close to infinite field of information
695000	697000	that's so rich that it can't be exhausted
697000	700000	into a narrower form that's focal and useful
700000	703000	for this particular time and this particular place
703000	705000	for this particular set of activities.
705000	707000	So it's a narrowing process.
707000	710000	Yeah, okay, so I'll respond to the second thing first
710000	712000	because that will actually help me to respond
712000	715000	to your first question about the posing of the question.
715000	717000	Yeah, I think that's a good way of putting it.
717000	719000	Although I would want to emphasize
719000	722000	that I don't think that process is just a selection process,
722000	724000	it's an important transformation process
724000	728000	because we do something to the information,
728000	731000	and you made reference to this in the embodiment.
731000	734000	It's not just that we have sort of passively taken in the information
734000	736000	or selected it from the environment.
736000	740000	We make the pieces, like you said, we find patterns.
740000	742000	It's how the pieces are relevant to each other,
742000	744000	how they're relevant to us.
744000	746000	Again, and I'm trying to emphasize this,
746000	749000	not just as some sort of cold calculation
749000	752000	about that information, but a way in which...
752000	755000	I mean, we say it like we make sense.
755000	758000	It's constitutive of our cognitive agency.
758000	761000	Just like our bodies take in matter,
761000	763000	but they don't just select the matter,
763000	765000	they transform it and restructure it,
765000	767000	so we have the ability to operate in the world.
767000	769000	Our minds don't just select the information,
769000	772000	they take in it, they transform it and structure it,
772000	774000	so analogous to our bodies,
774000	777000	we gain skills and abilities to interact with that world
777000	779000	from which that information was selected.
779000	783000	That's why I think people love to watch bands improvise,
783000	785000	because really what they're doing,
785000	787000	especially if they're doing it collectively,
787000	789000	is they're engaging in a collective process
789000	791000	of the spontaneous transmutation of patterns.
791000	794000	And I think the reason that people find that so deeply meaningful
794000	797000	is because it is representation,
797000	800000	like an ongoing abstract artistic representation.
800000	804000	I think it's an exemplification of what we do in the world.
804000	806000	That's right. I think one of the reasons why we like art
806000	808000	is we play with the variance...
808000	811000	We're playing in the Piagetian sense of playing,
811000	813000	in the sense of developing our skills.
813000	816000	We play with the relevance realization machinery for its own sake.
816000	818000	But that allows me to go back to your...
818000	822000	I think asking for the meaning of life,
822000	824000	it carries with it sort of...
824000	826000	even saying the meaning in life,
826000	830000	it carries with it the presupposition that meaning is sort of there to be found,
830000	835000	and it immediately steers us away from this ongoing process
835000	837000	in which we're taking in information,
837000	840000	transforming it, structuring it,
840000	842000	altering ourselves, fitting to a world
842000	846000	that is then also itself, restructuring itself, changing itself.
846000	849000	And so there's this ongoing, evolving relationship.
849000	852000	So one of the reasons why I don't like the question,
852000	856000	the meaning of life, is it proposes a ready-made answer to be found.
856000	860000	It presupposes a static thing to be discovered,
860000	862000	or even a static relation to be realized.
862000	867000	And it also carries with it the idea that...
867000	870000	It's like, like you said,
870000	875000	it's like there is an answer to a question that has been posed,
875000	879000	when I don't think the issue facing us is a riddle
879000	883000	or a question in that sense that some proposition will satisfy.
883000	885000	I don't think there's anything that...
885000	887000	I'm sorry, this will sound incredibly pretentious,
887000	889000	but I'm being asked about, I think.
889000	890000	I don't think there's anything...
890000	892000	I'm trying to make him sound pretentious.
892000	895000	I don't think there's a proposition that anybody can say to you
895000	897000	that will render your life meaningful.
897000	900000	I mean, you might do things with that proposition
900000	903000	that might fit you better to the world
903000	906000	so that horror becomes less prevalent
906000	908000	and flourishing becomes more prominent.
908000	911000	But to think that the answer is in the proposition
911000	916000	is to misunderstand the role of propositions in our cognition.
916000	918000	The propositional level is very high up
918000	922000	and sits on many recursive levels of relevance realization
922000	927000	that only at their very tip produce this kind of propositional processing.
927000	932000	The meaning is much more our knowing how to interact with the world,
932000	937000	knowing how to fit my hand to this glass is part of that process.
937000	940000	And that's not based on sort of just...
940000	944000	It's not primarily based on my beliefs about the glass.
944000	947000	It's based on a much more complex dynamical system
947000	951000	by which my body, my perception, the glass, the atmosphere
951000	953000	are fitting together so that I can grasp the glass.
953000	956000	So one of the things that I found interesting,
956000	959000	I learned this, I think, mostly from Gibson,
959000	964000	who wrote a book called...
964000	967000	One of the things Gibson presupposes,
967000	971000	he has a very interesting way of looking at the world
971000	975000	and it's tied deeply into our fundamental presuppositions
975000	977000	about the structure of reality
977000	980000	because one of the big issues about meaning in some sense
980000	985000	is whether it's fundamentally constitutive of reality
985000	988000	or if it's what would you call an emergent property
988000	989000	of something more fundamental.
989000	994000	Now the answer to that question in part is exactly what do you mean by reality
994000	997000	and also the question is also what do you mean by truth
997000	1000000	and this isn't Pontius Pilate's question,
1000000	1002000	it's a whole different kind of question.
1002000	1007000	Now the modern neuroscientists in some sense following Gibson
1007000	1010000	make the claim that when you look at a glass like that
1010000	1014000	that what happens in your brain is that the pattern of the glass
1014000	1017000	maps itself onto the pattern of your gripping hand
1017000	1020000	and that maps itself onto the pattern of pouring and drinking
1020000	1025000	and that a lot of that happens potentially before or alongside
1025000	1029000	your conscious perception of the glass as an object.
1029000	1033000	So we know for example that there are people who claim to be blind
1033000	1036000	who can still map objects onto their body.
1036000	1038000	So that's called blind sight.
1038000	1043000	So developing that idea, it's appeared to me
1043000	1047000	that there's good evidence that what we see when we look at the world is meaning.
1047000	1052000	We don't see objects and infer meaning, we see meaning and we infer objects
1052000	1055000	and so then the question is well is the meaning real
1055000	1059000	and then that answer to that is well what do you mean by real
1059000	1062000	and it'll only take me a minute to lay this out.
1062000	1066000	This starts to depend on whether you're a Darwinian or a Newtonian.
1066000	1070000	If you're a Newtonian then the real thing is the material object
1070000	1074000	and we also know that Newton in some important ways was wrong
1074000	1078000	but if you're a Darwinian and you almost have to be a Darwinian
1078000	1083000	I really don't see any escape from it unless you don't know what you're talking about fundamentally.
1083000	1092000	There's reasons for that is that the thing that determines whether or not
1092000	1098000	you're going to survive and propagate which is by the way the best solution
1098000	1102000	you can possibly answer to the problem of life if you're a biological organism
1102000	1107000	and you have a Darwinian philosophy, the question you're trying to answer is
1107000	1110000	what is the appropriate meaning to perceive in each environment
1110000	1113000	because that determines your action and your action
1113000	1117000	the consequences of your action determines whether you survive and propagate
1117000	1121000	and so if you take the question of meaning from a Darwinian perspective
1121000	1125000	you can actually say as far as I can tell that the fundamental constituent elements
1125000	1128000	at least of experience and perhaps of reality itself
1128000	1132000	are the meanings that you perceive before you infer the object.
1132000	1137000	Now that's a pretty radical ontological claim and I've never heard anyone else actually make it
1137000	1139000	except for maybe the pragmatists.
1139000	1144000	It's a variant of pragmatic philosophy but I've tried to wrap my head around that argument
1144000	1149000	and see if I can destroy it but I can't so I'm just wondering what you think about that.
1149000	1152000	I have a lot to think about that and I have a lot to say about it.
1152000	1158000	First of all, before I get into the Darwinian Newtonian thing
1158000	1161000	which I've seen you do a couple of times before and I've always found it very interesting.
1161000	1163000	It's one of my little tricks.
1163000	1167000	You belittle it, it's one of your good tricks. I mean it's a very good one.
1167000	1169000	It's a very good point.
1169000	1174000	First of all the question, I do think that fittedness to the world does create
1174000	1181000	I think Plato had a fantastic insight that above and beyond any particular desire we have
1181000	1184000	we have a desire for what we desire to be real in some sense.
1184000	1188000	One of the ways to rob meaning from your life is to suddenly realize
1188000	1191000	that a bunch of things, a bunch of the things you've desired
1191000	1195000	or the bunch of the things that you thought made you happy are illusory in some sense.
1195000	1199000	In fact people will do a bizarre thing and I do this every time in a class.
1199000	1205000	I'll ask how many of you are in really satisfying, deeply satisfying personal relationships
1205000	1209000	and surprisingly many people put up their hands.
1210000	1213000	Those are the self-deceptive ones.
1216000	1218000	And then I do the following.
1218000	1222000	I say how many of you would want to know if your partner was cheating on you
1222000	1224000	such that it would destroy the relationship
1224000	1227000	and almost all of them put their hands back up again.
1229000	1236000	They would rather have the truth than have all of that other stuff that they find so good be illusory.
1236000	1239000	And I think that was one of Plato's profound insights.
1239000	1243000	This connectedness to reality is a fundamental drive in us.
1243000	1247000	You know John, when you're asking that you're basically asking people whether or not
1247000	1251000	if they were in a perfect garden they'd be willing to check out the snake.
1251000	1252000	Yes, right.
1252000	1256000	And the answer of course we all know is that well of course people will check out the snake
1256000	1258000	because that's just what we're like.
1258000	1260000	But I do think there's something important to that.
1260000	1264000	I think ultimately the platonic orientation towards truth
1264000	1267000	is grounded in that notion of a deeper drive towards real.
1267000	1272000	I think asking the question about whether or not meaning is real
1272000	1276000	part of it I want to challenge the presupposition behind the question first
1276000	1280000	because the presupposition behind that is that only things are real
1280000	1283000	and that relationships, relations between things aren't real.
1283000	1288000	And I think it is very, so it might strike people as odd for me to say
1288000	1291000	yes of course I think relevance is real
1291000	1294000	I don't think it's part, and this is where I might differ with you
1294000	1295000	but I think we'll have to negotiate it.
1295000	1299000	I don't think it's part of the physical fabric of the universe
1299000	1303000	nor do I think it is just a subjective illusion on our head.
1303000	1307000	It is a real relation between us and the environment.
1307000	1313000	Just like evolution is a real relation between an organism and its environment.
1313000	1315000	It's not a property of the environment.
1315000	1317000	It's not a property of the organism.
1317000	1322000	It's a real relation between them that explains both the history of the organism
1322000	1324000	and the history of the environment.
1324000	1326000	So that would be a lovely thing to see if we can get clear
1326000	1331000	because that's a very profound argument, like a profound debate.
1331000	1335000	There are Heideggerians who took opposite positions on that.
1335000	1336000	Yes, I'm aware of that.
1336000	1338000	And some of them were psychologists, right?
1338000	1341000	And so I'm just going to outline it for the audience
1341000	1343000	and to make sure we're thinking about it the same way.
1343000	1347000	One stance is that meaning, so to speak,
1347000	1352000	is a consequence of the operation of these elaborate patterns of construction
1352000	1355000	in your mind and that you're imposing that on the world.
1355000	1356000	So it's like a structure issue.
1356000	1358000	Yeah, that's a romantic issue with meaning.
1358000	1362000	And then the other one is that meaning is in the world, so to speak,
1362000	1365000	and that what you do with the structures in your head is limited and narrow it.
1365000	1369000	And I think in some weird way both of those things are true.
1369000	1373000	But here's something that I've been thinking about for a long time
1373000	1377000	and I want you to maybe help me figure out a bit more.
1377000	1382000	So I'm going to go at this from two perspectives.
1382000	1385000	So back in the late 1800s,
1385000	1389000	Nietzsche basically formalized a set of observations
1389000	1391000	about what he thought was happening in Western society
1391000	1393000	and then the world at large, right?
1393000	1395000	And the basic argument was something like this,
1395000	1398000	was that the metaphysical presuppositions of religious systems
1398000	1402000	and the metaphysical presuppositions of scientific systems were not in sync.
1402000	1404000	They weren't of the same paradigm.
1404000	1408000	And that as Western scientific investigation had preceded,
1408000	1414000	it became obvious that either the truths of religion weren't true
1414000	1418000	or at least that they weren't of the type that science recognized as truth.
1418000	1421000	And Nietzsche basically described that as the death of God.
1421000	1425000	And so he said that three things would happen in the aftermath of that.
1426000	1429000	He was a prophet. He was like an Old Testament prophet.
1429000	1435000	He said that totalitarianism would become unbelievably attractive to people,
1435000	1439000	especially in its hyper-socialist variants like communism,
1439000	1443000	and that millions of people would die in the 20th century as a consequence of that
1443000	1445000	and that it would be a necessary battle.
1445000	1448000	And he said that like 40 years before the Russian Revolution
1448000	1450000	and so like, yeah, go Nietzsche.
1450000	1454000	You try to predict the future like five years ahead, see how far you get.
1454000	1461000	And then the other thing he said would be that nihilism would rise to pathological proportions
1461000	1464000	because it's basically the polar opposite of totalitarianism, right?
1464000	1466000	You wipe out the religious structures.
1466000	1469000	People move towards ideology to reattain that certainty,
1469000	1474000	but it's rigid and deadly, or they fall off into chaos itself.
1474000	1478000	Okay, then Nietzsche made one more proposition which was that
1479000	1484000	the only solution to that would be for human beings to transform themselves
1484000	1487000	into meaning-creating creatures.
1487000	1491000	And so what Nietzsche basically did, and I think this was a mistake in his metaphysics,
1491000	1495000	was that he assumed that the objective description of reality was correct,
1495000	1499000	that reality in and of itself was dead and meaningless,
1499000	1502000	but that human beings could interact with that in such a way
1502000	1506000	as a consequence of their individual choices to make that richly meaningful.
1506000	1511000	And that we needed to do that because the alternatives would be nihilism or totalitarianism.
1511000	1515000	One more comment on that.
1515000	1519000	So, you know, Jung was a student of Nietzsche, a profound student,
1519000	1522000	and he was actually trying to solve the problem that Nietzsche put forward,
1522000	1525000	which was, oh, wow, we got nihilism on the one hand
1525000	1527000	and we got totalitarianism on the other hand,
1527000	1530000	and, you know, those don't really seem to be very good solutions
1530000	1532000	since millions of people die because of one
1532000	1535000	and millions of people commit suicide because of the other.
1535000	1539000	It's like those are suboptimal solutions in all likelihood.
1539000	1545000	So, but Jung in some sense took issue with Nietzsche's fundamental proposition,
1545000	1549000	which was that human beings were meaning creating creatures.
1549000	1553000	And I actually think it's the most profound critique of Nietzsche
1553000	1558000	because what Jung pointed out, this is something that just blew me away when I first understood it,
1558000	1563000	and it has to do with your relevance realization issue in a deadly way.
1563000	1568000	It's like, imagine the things that attract your attention and your interest.
1568000	1570000	Well, okay, so then you might think,
1570000	1575000	well, is that a voluntary process or an involuntary process?
1575000	1577000	And to answer that, you can think about it.
1577000	1581000	It's like you're working on some dismally wretched, boring,
1581000	1584000	and stultifying thing at work or as a student,
1584000	1588000	and your attention is like fragmented everywhere.
1588000	1590000	You think about the dust bunnies under your bed
1590000	1592000	and that maybe the dishes need to be done
1592000	1594000	or maybe the rug needs to be walked
1594000	1596000	and the rug needs to be vacuumed
1596000	1599000	and it's like bloody well anything other than that boring task.
1599000	1603000	Even though you know you have to do it in order to say pass a course
1603000	1605000	or pass an exam or get the assignment done,
1605000	1607000	you can't control your damn brain.
1607000	1609000	It's wandering everywhere.
1609000	1612000	And then, so the weird thing about that
1612000	1615000	is that you cannot voluntarily control your relevance realization.
1615000	1617000	And then you have the contrary problem,
1617000	1622000	which is that there's a YouTube video about kittens
1622000	1625000	and it's like bang man, you're focused on that.
1625000	1628000	And so one of the things you might ask
1628000	1632000	is just who the hell is in control of this relevance realization?
1632000	1634000	And that was Jung's question.
1634000	1636000	It was like, well where Nietzsche fell apart,
1636000	1639000	Nietzsche fell apart was that he assumed that human beings
1639000	1642000	were primarily meaning making creatures.
1642000	1644000	But then if you try it, it's like,
1644000	1647000	hey, I'm going to find it really meaningful to go to the gym
1647000	1649000	three times a week next week for half an hour
1649000	1651000	and I'm going to push myself right to my limits.
1651000	1653000	It's like I have every reason for doing it.
1653000	1655000	I know why I should do it,
1655000	1658000	but I'd rather sit on the couch in my underwear and eat cheetes.
1658000	1660000	Cheetos.
1666000	1669000	So you've got to ask yourself, man, who's in charge.
1669000	1673000	And one of the things that the psychodynamic theorists were so damn good at
1673000	1678000	was pointing out that, well, you think it's you, but it's not.
1678000	1680000	And so then that begs the question.
1680000	1684000	It's like, where's the meaning coming from and who is in charge?
1684000	1687000	And so I know that's questions that you're trying to answer,
1687000	1691000	but it doesn't exactly seem to me that we're overlaying that on the world
1691000	1694000	or that if we are, we don't have much voluntary control over that.
1694000	1697000	Okay, well, I don't think we're overlaying it on the world
1697000	1699000	and that's what I meant by a real relation
1699000	1701000	and I was comparing it to evolution.
1701000	1706000	I think to talk about us being meaning makers in the Nietzschean sense
1706000	1710000	is to fall prey to the romantic illusion
1710000	1712000	that the world is a blank slate.
1712000	1715000	I mean, you have the blank slate of the enlightenment
1715000	1718000	in which reason the world writes on us
1718000	1720000	and then you have the blank slate of the romantics
1720000	1722000	in which the world is a blank slate,
1722000	1725000	like the unpainted canvas that we...
1725000	1729000	And Nietzsche constantly used the artistic metaphor
1729000	1731000	and even created the idea of a lifestyle
1731000	1734000	as if our lives are works of art
1734000	1738000	because the world is just an empty canvas upon which we project our meaning.
1738000	1741000	Well, and there's totalitarian presuppositions in there too
1741000	1745000	because one of the presuppositions of totalitarian ideologues
1745000	1747000	is that there is no such thing as human nature
1747000	1750000	and that people can be constructed in any way possible.
1750000	1753000	Exactly, and that's why existentialism comes out of Nietzsche
1753000	1756000	because existentialism posits that our essence and our nature
1756000	1758000	is completely the property of our own self-definition.
1758000	1763000	So what I'm actually doing is I'm rejecting both of those blank slates.
1763000	1765000	I'm saying the world is neither a blank slate
1765000	1767000	that we romantically project upon
1767000	1772000	nor is the mind a blank slate that experience just empirically draws upon.
1772000	1777000	What I'm proposing instead is a dynamic interaction between the two
1777000	1783000	and to say that who's in charge is kind of an odd question
1783000	1785000	but before I answer that,
1785000	1789000	I want to take a little bit of exception on your interpretation of Nietzsche
1789000	1792000	because I think it might help
1792000	1795000	and it also might get us back to the Newton-Darwin thing
1795000	1797000	which I promise to get back to too.
1797000	1803000	I mean, Nietzsche lays, and again, Heidegger followed up on this,
1803000	1807000	he actually lays the history of nihilism much further back.
1807000	1810000	He says that the history of nihilism starts with Plato
1810000	1813000	and that Christianity is just Plato for the masses
1813000	1817000	because my interpretation of Nietzsche is that the main cause of nihilism
1817000	1820000	goes back to the Acts of Revolution.
1820000	1822000	It's the creation of the two-world model
1822000	1827000	and the idea is that this world gets its meaning, its value,
1827000	1831000	it has an instrumental value in getting us to some other world,
1831000	1835000	to some world in which we will finally find the fulfillment
1835000	1839000	and the protection from horror that we don't find in this world,
1839000	1841000	a heaven, right?
1841000	1843000	And then what happens, right?
1843000	1847000	It wasn't just the clash between the scientific and the religious worldview.
1847000	1852000	What happens is that the scientific worldview calls the second world,
1852000	1854000	the heavenly world, into question.
1854000	1860000	But what happened is we have millennia of Christianity and Platonism
1860000	1865000	tutoring us to believe that this world is not meaningful in itself
1865000	1868000	because it's only valuable insofar as we get to this heaven.
1868000	1872000	And when science says, I imagine that there is no heaven,
1872000	1874000	or John Lennon, right?
1874000	1876000	Then we're left.
1876000	1877000	My favorite beatle.
1877000	1879000	We're left, right?
1879000	1881000	That really dates me, doesn't it?
1881000	1885000	Then we're left with this world that we've been tutored for millennia,
1885000	1888000	has no value in it.
1888000	1892000	And so I think what Nietzsche was trying to do,
1892000	1894000	I agree with you, there's a romantic streak in Nietzsche
1894000	1896000	and like I said, I reject that romantic streak
1896000	1900000	that the world is a blank slate upon which we paint our lifestyles.
1900000	1903000	That is ridiculously hubristic in nature.
1903000	1906000	But there was another thing Nietzsche was trying to do,
1906000	1909000	and so I think there's, I mean Nietzsche has multiple voices,
1909000	1910000	it has anything.
1910000	1912000	So in addition to the romantic project,
1912000	1914000	which I often find really bombastic,
1914000	1918000	there is another project that he called trying to revalue the earth,
1918000	1923000	which was to try to see the earth as a place in which we could be at home.
1924000	1927000	On its own terms, for its own sake.
1927000	1929000	So that was more Heidegger, I think.
1929000	1934000	No, no, Heidegger talks about learning how to revalue the earth
1934000	1938000	and loving the earth as a repeated theme throughout Nietzsche's work,
1938000	1941000	and loving the body is a repeated theme in Nietzsche's work.
1941000	1945000	Because he thought that just like we had the two worlds,
1945000	1947000	we had the two parts of us, we had the body,
1947000	1950000	but the body only existed in service of the soul,
1950000	1953000	and the body therefore has no inherent value,
1953000	1957000	because its only job is to get the soul to the only place where it has real meaning,
1957000	1958000	which is heaven.
1958000	1962000	And then his point was, if we lose the heaven and if we lose the idea of the soul,
1962000	1966000	we have to get back to revaluing the body, revaluing the earth.
1966000	1970000	And what I'm proposing in this sort of evolutionary model of relevance realisation
1970000	1975000	is exactly that the body and the earth co-create this real relation
1975000	1979000	that fundamentally homes us and fits us into the world.
1979000	1983000	And that the meaning crisis and therefore, it's not just...
1983000	1987000	I mean, yes, I agree, there are definitely historical forces for it
1987000	1992000	and the rise of science and the demise of the wisdom traditions and the religious traditions.
1992000	1995000	But I think the meaning crisis is in some sense also a perennial problem.
1995000	1998000	You see it cross-culturally, you see it cross-historically,
1998000	2002000	because people can always get trapped between these two kinds of perspectives
2002000	2003000	they can have on themselves.
2003000	2006000	They can always fall prey to these kinds of two world models.
2007000	2010000	And so I think the thing I want to say is
2013000	2018000	part of what's going on right now in the meaning crisis in the West
2018000	2019000	is we're trying to...
2019000	2022000	And this is the way Nietzsche, I think, was prescient, as you said.
2022000	2024000	He was a prophet.
2024000	2026000	By the way, he predicted four things.
2026000	2028000	He predicted that he would be famous eventually.
2030000	2033000	Although that he would basically starve to death in the meantime.
2033000	2035000	Right, but why I am so great was one of his...
2035000	2037000	Timing is everything.
2037000	2039000	Yeah, exactly.
2039000	2044000	And so what he was prescient about is the fact that...
2044000	2048000	I mean, basically since the actual age in 800 BCE and onward,
2048000	2050000	we've had this two-world model.
2050000	2053000	And now we're going through a radical re-embedding.
2053000	2056000	And for a lot of people, that's caused a kind of nihilism.
2056000	2059000	But one of the things I would throw out to you is that
2059000	2063000	there's a possibility in an emerging cognitive science,
2063000	2065000	and a cognitive science in which embodiment and embeddiment
2065000	2070000	are becoming central for appropriating that re-embedding process
2070000	2075000	as a way of discovering, rediscovering how we can be at home,
2075000	2077000	fundamentally at home in the world,
2077000	2080000	and how the earth and our bodies co-create that home
2080000	2082000	in a way that, again, protects us from horror
2082000	2085000	and allows us to flourish as cognitive agents.
2085000	2089000	So you did something I think is lovely,
2089000	2092000	and I don't think that it's people who aren't quite deeply educated can do,
2092000	2095000	is you pushed the problem quite a bit farther back in time.
2095000	2097000	So I want to one-up you on that.
2097000	2099000	Okay.
2099000	2104000	So I do think it's a deeper problem than Nietzsche pointed out.
2104000	2108000	He pointed out the more articulated modern end of it.
2108000	2111000	And we see that as the conflict, say, between science and religion.
2111000	2114000	But if you can push these sorts of things back,
2114000	2117000	I think to the dawn of self-consciousness itself.
2117000	2120000	And one of the reasons that I've been so obsessed with the book of Genesis
2120000	2126000	is because I read Genesis as a dramatic representation
2126000	2129000	of the coming to self-consciousness of mankind.
2129000	2132000	Because what happens with Adam and Eve when they eat the fruit
2132000	2134000	that the snake delivers to them,
2134000	2138000	which is very interesting sort of phenomena from an evolutionary perspective,
2138000	2139000	which I can talk about later,
2139000	2142000	what happens to Adam and Eve is very, very specific.
2142000	2144000	I mean, the first thing that happens...
2144000	2146000	I'm sorry, I might get the order wrong.
2146000	2149000	But the first thing that happens is that they realize
2149000	2151000	their eyes are opened and they're like gods
2151000	2153000	knowing the difference between good and evil.
2153000	2155000	And that's very interesting,
2155000	2158000	because it associates the development of self-consciousness
2158000	2162000	and the rise of articulated and complicated morality.
2162000	2164000	And so I've thought about that for a long time.
2164000	2166000	It's like, okay, you realize you're naked.
2166000	2168000	What does that mean?
2168000	2170000	Well, you don't want to be naked up here on the stage,
2170000	2172000	if you're speaking properly to the audience you are.
2172000	2174000	But maybe you don't want that.
2174000	2175000	Okay, well, why?
2175000	2177000	Why don't you want to be up here naked on the stage?
2177000	2179000	It's everyone's nightmare, right?
2179000	2182000	Well, you know, you're kind of flawed and saggy,
2182000	2185000	and there's parts of you that are not that beautiful,
2185000	2188000	even if you happen to be a supermodel.
2188000	2190000	And you're not as bright as you could be,
2190000	2192000	and your hair might be going a little bit,
2192000	2194000	and your teeth aren't that great,
2194000	2196000	and you're not as smart as you could be,
2196000	2197000	and you've got a lot of flaws,
2197000	2199000	plus you're going to get sick, and then you're going to die.
2199000	2201000	It's like, right, right.
2201000	2203000	So that's all nakedness.
2203000	2206000	If you think about nakedness as vulnerability.
2206000	2208000	And so we had to come to terms with her vulnerability
2208000	2210000	when we became self-conscious.
2210000	2211000	So then you might think,
2211000	2213000	well, what the hell does that have to do with morality?
2213000	2214000	And I did figure that out.
2214000	2217000	It took me like 15 years of thinking to figure that out.
2217000	2221000	It's like, if I know I'm naked and vulnerable,
2221000	2224000	and I know you are the same,
2224000	2226000	then I know what will hurt me.
2226000	2228000	And once I know what will hurt me,
2228000	2230000	I know what will hurt you.
2230000	2232000	And so animals prey on each other.
2232000	2234000	Lions eat gazelles,
2234000	2237000	and worms eat lions, and all of that.
2237000	2240000	But there's nothing like a human being
2240000	2243000	for sheer outright atrocious torture.
2243000	2245000	And you don't get that without self-consciousness.
2245000	2248000	So that's where I think the knowledge of good and evil comes.
2248000	2250000	It's like it's no longer prey and predator.
2250000	2252000	It's like torture and victim.
2252000	2254000	So that's one thing.
2255000	2259000	And part of that sets up this dichotomy in human beings
2259000	2262000	between whatever it is that our consciousness seems to be
2262000	2264000	and our self-consciousness,
2264000	2267000	and this terrible, limited burden that we carry around
2267000	2269000	as a body that we're conscious of.
2269000	2271000	So there's that dichotomy.
2271000	2274000	That dichotomy emerges back at the beginning
2274000	2276000	of the dichotomy of self-consciousness.
2276000	2278000	It's a problem we're trying to solve all the time.
2278000	2281000	And I mean, Nietzsche's criticism of Christianity
2281000	2284000	was that he believed that Christianity
2284000	2286000	failed to solve that problem
2286000	2289000	because instead of dealing with the reality of the catastrophe,
2289000	2292000	which is, say, the degenerate form of our material body,
2292000	2295000	the church basically damned that to perdition,
2295000	2298000	describing it as a work of the devils, so to speak,
2298000	2301000	and then concentrated on spiritual salvation.
2301000	2308000	Now, you knew this element of Christian religious thought
2308000	2310000	and the Nietzschean transformations of that,
2310000	2313000	and that's part of the reason why he went back to alchemy,
2313000	2316000	because one of the things Jung was interested in was
2316000	2318000	why did science develop?
2318000	2321000	It only developed in Europe as far as we know,
2321000	2323000	and the Greeks didn't have it, and the Romans didn't have it,
2323000	2326000	and the Chinese didn't have it, and the Indians didn't have it,
2326000	2328000	and it's like, well, they weren't stupid.
2328000	2330000	What was up with them and why Europe?
2330000	2332000	What exactly happened there?
2332000	2334000	It's not like we precisely know the answer to that,
2334000	2337000	but one of the things that Jung suggested,
2337000	2339000	and it's brilliant as far as I'm concerned,
2340000	2346000	the cognitive apparatuses that we're blessed with are compensatory,
2346000	2349000	so that if we formulate a theory about one domain
2349000	2351000	and take it to a real extreme,
2351000	2357000	the unconscious mind will start to formulate a counter proposition,
2357000	2360000	which is formulated of all the things we notice
2360000	2362000	that don't fit in with that theory,
2362000	2364000	and then they start to flap around
2364000	2368000	and associate with each other as a consequence of emotional contagion,
2368000	2371000	and they start to manifest themselves in patterns,
2371000	2374000	and that once that counter position emerges
2374000	2378000	as a sufficiently complex and dynamic living system,
2378000	2381000	it has the opportunity to fight with the other system,
2381000	2383000	and sometimes you'll have a revelation,
2383000	2385000	and the revelation is basically the overthrow
2385000	2388000	of the current perspective by the new emergent perspective.
2389000	2392000	Jung viewed alchemy in that light.
2392000	2396000	He said that the Christian concentration on hyper-spiritualization
2396000	2398000	was extremely useful, this is something Nietzsche agreed with,
2398000	2401000	was unbelievably useful for the discipline of the mind,
2401000	2404000	so Nietzsche, of course, is an anti-Christian,
2404000	2406000	at least that's what he said,
2406000	2409000	but he also said that Catholicism tempered the European spirit
2409000	2411000	like nothing else could have,
2411000	2413000	and he really meant the whole Judeo-Christian tradition,
2413000	2416000	which was the attempt to force everything
2416000	2420000	into a unified and hierarchically arranged interpretation.
2420000	2423000	Nietzsche's idea was once you did that once, man,
2423000	2425000	you could go do that all sorts of different places,
2425000	2430000	so alchemy as a precursor to science
2430000	2433000	was based initially on a fantasy,
2433000	2437000	and the fantasy was if we paid enough attention
2437000	2441000	to the transformations of matter rather than of spirit,
2441000	2444000	that we could redeem what Christianity,
2444000	2447000	with its emphasis on the spirit, had failed to redeem.
2447000	2450000	So it was sort of like all the 14th century Europeans woke up
2450000	2453000	and said, hmm, Christ died for our sins,
2453000	2455000	and we're supposed to be redeemed,
2455000	2457000	but a lot of guys are down there with leprosy in the ditch,
2457000	2461000	so it doesn't seem to have exactly fulfilled its promise,
2461000	2463000	and so he felt that the European imagination
2463000	2467000	started to drift into the transformations of the material world,
2467000	2473000	but that was also part of what was fundamentally a redemptive process.
2473000	2476000	It was just a more comprehensive redemptive process.
2476000	2479000	It was, all right, well, we kind of got the spirit organized,
2479000	2482000	now it's time to do something about the dreadful body
2482000	2484000	that we're dragging around with us
2484000	2486000	instead of merely damning it to perdition.
2486000	2488000	And one of the things that you might think about,
2488000	2491000	because we're also thinking about practical issues here,
2491000	2495000	is, well, we talked about multiple meanings,
2495000	2497000	kind of multiple low-level meanings.
2497000	2499000	There's the meaning of food and the meaning of water
2499000	2501000	and the meaning of sex and, you know,
2501000	2503000	the meaning of being too hot and too cold,
2503000	2505000	and there's all biological subsystems
2505000	2507000	that take care of those sorts of things.
2507000	2510000	It's like those are organized hierarchically in principle,
2510000	2512000	so there's something lurking at the top.
2512000	2515000	And I think part of what religious mythologies do over years,
2515000	2517000	centuries, thousands of years,
2517000	2521000	is try to get a picture of what should be at the top.
2521000	2523000	That's like the monotheistic impulse.
2523000	2525000	What's the highest value?
2525000	2527000	And here's something to consider.
2527000	2529000	You know, you can wonder about this in your own lives
2529000	2531000	when people think about the meaning of their life.
2531000	2536000	What they mean is, are all the subsidiary meanings
2536000	2540000	meaningful given that there's an ultimate reality
2540000	2542000	of suffering and limitation.
2542000	2545000	And so one of the things that might be asked,
2545000	2548000	and I think that scientists do ask this in part,
2548000	2551000	is maybe we shouldn't deal with that question
2551000	2555000	before we fix everything we can possibly fix.
2555000	2557000	And so one of the things that I would also suggest
2557000	2560000	is that when you're motivated by meanings
2560000	2562000	that are other than subsidiary,
2562000	2566000	say the same meanings that animate mammals and reptiles
2566000	2569000	and even bloody lobsters, for that matter,
2569000	2572000	when you're working at higher-order levels of meaning,
2572000	2575000	partly what you're attempting to do
2575000	2579000	is to generate solutions to the micro-problems
2579000	2581000	of negative meaning that always beset you.
2581000	2583000	You know, it's like, well,
2583000	2585000	is there something wrong in your family?
2585000	2587000	Well, that's meaningful.
2587000	2589000	The meaning is negative.
2589000	2592000	So does that make your family worthwhile or worthless?
2592000	2594000	Well, the question is,
2594000	2596000	depends on what you do with your family.
2596000	2599000	And you know, so the problem with nihilism,
2599000	2602000	as far as I can tell, is that the nihilist presumes
2602000	2605000	that the finitude that we perceive
2605000	2607000	invalidates the utility of being.
2607000	2611000	It's like, well, that's pretty arrogant, you might say.
2611000	2614000	You might say that judging the whole world in that light,
2614000	2617000	which is what that comedian just did on that TV show
2617000	2620000	that he laid into God, I can't remember his name,
2620000	2622000	blaming him for bone cancer and children, for example,
2622000	2624000	which really does suck, you know.
2624000	2627000	So the point is, is that one of the things
2627000	2630000	that we find meaningful and we could find meaningful
2630000	2633000	and that's reliable is,
2633000	2636000	let's leave the damn question aside about the ultimate meaning
2636000	2639000	of reality in its corrupt form, which is now,
2639000	2641000	and try to fix the damn thing.
2641000	2643000	Really try to fix it.
2643000	2645000	And then see what happens,
2645000	2647000	it's clear that we can make things better
2647000	2649000	and it's bloody clear that we can make things worse,
2649000	2651000	so you might ask, okay, well, if you organized
2651000	2654000	your little value hierarchy underneath the proposition
2654000	2657000	that it's up to you to work to bring the kingdom of God
2657000	2661000	to life instead of hell, then maybe the whole problem
2661000	2664000	of the negative meaning of life would go away.
2664000	2666000	It's like you never know, beats the alternative,
2666000	2669000	which is to damn the whole thing to perdition,
2669000	2672000	which we really tried hard to do in the 20th century
2672000	2675000	with a fair bit of success, or just to think,
2675000	2677000	oh, well, this is meaningless and useless
2677000	2679000	and I don't have any responsibility
2679000	2681000	and there's no such thing as meaning,
2681000	2684000	and it's like, sure, walk down that road, man,
2684000	2686000	see where you go.
2688000	2689000	Okay.
2689000	2693000	It seems the both of you agree that there's this
2693000	2695000	lower level meaning system that we have,
2695000	2698000	which is almost like a moment to moment perceptual system
2698000	2701000	where we know how to interact with things.
2701000	2703000	And both of you disagree, both of you agree
2703000	2707000	that there's no higher level, the meaning of life.
2707000	2709000	But in alluding to the meaning crisis
2709000	2712000	and just general morality, you seem to assume
2712000	2714000	that we can somehow cobble this ability
2714000	2717000	to know how to interact with the glass,
2717000	2720000	to somehow interact with societies.
2720000	2724000	So how do you think we're able to do this?
2724000	2727000	First of all, to be careful,
2728000	2731000	and I said there's no ultimate meaning,
2731000	2733000	and like I said, I was also not saying
2733000	2735000	that that means that there's no ultimate meaning
2735000	2738000	because if you say a problem is poorly formed,
2738000	2740000	you're rejecting both the positive
2740000	2742000	and the negative answer to that question.
2742000	2744000	It doesn't imply that, therefore,
2744000	2746000	the ultimate meaning is that there's no meaning.
2746000	2748000	It's like saying what's north of the North Pole.
2748000	2750000	The answer is not anything.
2750000	2752000	It's to reject the question.
2752000	2755000	So I first want to challenge that move you made.
2755000	2758000	Secondly, I do think that...
2758000	2760000	I want to reply...
2760000	2762000	I do think that what I'm trying to argue for,
2762000	2764000	and I think Jordan is, but I'm not clear
2764000	2767000	because he said about 17,000 things in his last thing.
2767000	2770000	I want to try and reply to them.
2772000	2775000	I'll spin them out, you sort of.
2777000	2779000	I'm arguing for a deep continuity
2779000	2781000	between those lower level processes
2781000	2783000	and the highest levels.
2783000	2786000	And I think Nietzsche tried to foreshadow that,
2786000	2788000	and this is again what I mean about the...
2788000	2790000	Nietzsche said, the height of my spirituality
2790000	2793000	reaches into the depth of my sexuality.
2793000	2795000	To try and find...
2795000	2798000	He was using both of those in a metaphorical extension.
2798000	2800000	I'm not only arguing for the lower level...
2800000	2803000	It's a pretty good statement for a virgin, too.
2808000	2811000	He was referring to Nietzsche, by the way, not me.
2814000	2817000	So I'm arguing for what I think is a very important thesis,
2817000	2820000	which is a deep continuity between the lower level
2820000	2823000	and, just speaking of it metaphorically, the higher level.
2823000	2825000	I do think there is an important issue
2825000	2828000	in which we can talk about that higher level
2828000	2830000	as distinct from the lower level
2830000	2832000	of just trying to solve our daily problems,
2832000	2834000	which I think is important.
2834000	2837000	Namely, and that's something that I think is important,
2837000	2840000	is that we can talk about that higher level
2840000	2842000	of problems, which I think is important.
2842000	2845000	Namely, and that's something that you referenced, Jordan.
2845000	2848000	We face a perennial problem of our self-consciousness,
2848000	2850000	and the problem with our self-consciousness
2850000	2852000	is it means we have this enormous capacity
2852000	2855000	to take a perspective on our own ability to take perspectives.
2855000	2857000	I mean, one of the things about being a conscious being,
2857000	2859000	and this is what I mean about a salient's landscape,
2859000	2862000	is we not only know facts, like propositions,
2862000	2865000	and we know how to do things,
2865000	2867000	we also have perspectival knowing.
2867000	2869000	This is the work I did with Leo Ferraro.
2869000	2872000	We know what it is like to be a certain thing,
2872000	2874000	to take a certain perspective,
2874000	2876000	to take a certain stance on the world.
2876000	2878000	I know what it's like to be a father.
2878000	2880000	I know what it's like to be a teacher.
2880000	2882000	And that perspectival knowing,
2882000	2885000	of knowing what it's like to be something,
2885000	2887000	is, again, this atmospheric meaning.
2887000	2889000	But the thing we can do
2889000	2892000	is we can take a perspective on that lower-order perspective.
2892000	2894000	We can stand back and say,
2894000	2896000	what does that perspective look like?
2896000	2898000	Let me give you an example.
2898000	2900000	I'm thirsty.
2900000	2902000	And so I have a thirsting perspective on the world.
2902000	2904000	Things that are watery are salient to me.
2904000	2906000	Things that might contain water.
2906000	2908000	You're getting thirsty right now, too, right?
2908000	2910000	It becomes salient to me.
2910000	2912000	But I can step back,
2912000	2914000	and this was something also discovered in India,
2914000	2916000	by the Buddhists,
2916000	2918000	I can step back
2918000	2920000	and take a look at my thirsting perspective.
2920000	2923000	I can say, what's it like to be a thirsty person?
2923000	2926000	And now I'm no longer thirsting,
2926000	2928000	because I'm now motivated
2928000	2930000	by something different than my thirst.
2930000	2932000	I'm motivated by my curiosity
2932000	2934000	about my lower-order thirst.
2934000	2936000	And then I can step back
2936000	2938000	and say, gee,
2938000	2940000	what's it like to be curious?
2940000	2942000	And then I can step back and wonder,
2942000	2944000	what's it like to be somebody asking
2944000	2946000	what's it like to be curious?
2946000	2948000	And then you can step back and say,
2948000	2950000	what's it like watching someone
2950000	2952000	listen to someone talk about being curious about it?
2952000	2954000	Exactly.
2954000	2956000	That's what I'm trying to make.
2956000	2958000	The point I'm trying to make
2958000	2960000	is what happens is
2960000	2962000	we have the capacity
2962000	2964000	to very quickly
2964000	2966000	move ourselves to what Nagel calls the view from nowhere.
2966000	2968000	To this bird's eye
2968000	2970000	or God's eye perspective
2970000	2972000	on all of reality,
2972000	2974000	in which we, by these recursive
2974000	2976000	asking of questions,
2976000	2978000	we have become deeply disengaged
2978000	2980000	from our involvement with the world.
2980000	2982000	We have an enormous capacity
2982000	2984000	for self-transcendence.
2984000	2986000	And I think this was also one of Nietzsche's insights,
2986000	2988000	although I think Nishitani called him
2988000	2990000	excellently to question on it.
2990000	2992000	Our capacity for self-transcendence,
2992000	2994000	our ability to rise above ourselves,
2994000	2996000	is also the very same thing
2996000	2998000	that can cause us to fall into despair
2998000	3000000	and absurdity.
3000000	3002000	Because we can empty the world
3002000	3004000	of all that involved meaning
3004000	3006000	by our capacity to transcend ourselves
3006000	3008000	to such a degree
3008000	3010000	that we are overlooking it all
3010000	3012000	for like five seconds here.
3012000	3014000	Okay, so I have a proposition
3014000	3016000	that goes along with this. You guys can think about this.
3016000	3018000	And I think
3018000	3020000	it's one of the advantages
3020000	3022000	of contemplating the notion
3022000	3024000	that meaning might be an actual phenomena
3024000	3026000	in and of itself. So I would say
3026000	3028000	you might say, well, when should you stop
3028000	3030000	recursing? Which is
3030000	3032000	what's the right level of analysis? Because I could say
3032000	3034000	who cares about this damn talk? The Sun
3034000	3036000	is going to envelop the Earth in four billion years.
3036000	3038000	It's like, you know, because that's
3038000	3040000	the ultimate meaninglessness of everything.
3040000	3042000	And my answer to that is
3042000	3044000	that's a stupid place to stand.
3044000	3046000	And the evidence for that
3046000	3048000	is, think about it this way, is that
3048000	3050000	if your capacity to experience
3050000	3052000	the kind of meaning that imbues your
3052000	3054000	life with
3054000	3056000	forward motion and with faith
3056000	3058000	and with joy and with gratitude,
3058000	3060000	imagine that that's actually a function
3060000	3062000	that you have psychologically.
3062000	3064000	And then imagine that that function
3064000	3066000	kicks in when you're looking at
3066000	3068000	things from the right perspective.
3068000	3070000	And so you might say, well
3070000	3072000	is this talk important? It's like
3072000	3074000	what's important to me right now? It seems to be
3074000	3076000	important to you guys. It has some potential
3076000	3078000	importance tomorrow and next week.
3078000	3080000	There's all meaning there. Is it
3080000	3082000	important from the perspective
3082000	3084000	of the age of the cosmos?
3084000	3086000	Well,
3086000	3088000	probably, but probably
3090000	3092000	perhaps not.
3092000	3094000	And so then I would say, well what does that do to
3094000	3096000	my sense of engagement with the issues at hand?
3096000	3098000	It undermines them and I fall into
3098000	3100000	a pit of meaninglessness and so then
3100000	3102000	I would say, well, hey let's not fall into that pit.
3102000	3104000	Let's pick a level of analysis
3104000	3106000	for the problem at hand
3106000	3108000	that most richly imbues it
3108000	3110000	with a sense of meaning and then
3110000	3112000	let's assume that that's part of the mechanism
3112000	3114000	that calibrates our soul, so to speak
3114000	3116000	and pay attention to that.
3116000	3118000	And so because I tell my students this all the time.
3118000	3120000	Wander around
3120000	3122000	and notice what's
3122000	3124000	meaningful to you. Just notice it.
3124000	3126000	It happens. You
3126000	3128000	can participate and you're absolutely right about that.
3128000	3130000	But it happens. Okay.
3130000	3132000	Try to stay where meaning
3132000	3134000	is optimized. And then I also
3134000	3136000	mention to them briefly
3136000	3138000	that that's kind of what the Taoist symbol is about
3138000	3140000	because the Taoist symbol is predicated
3140000	3142000	on the idea in a sense
3142000	3144000	that the world is made out of disorder,
3144000	3146000	chaos and order and
3146000	3148000	that there's a balance between those two things
3148000	3150000	and that if you stand on
3150000	3152000	the border between order and chaos
3152000	3154000	so that things are structured properly
3154000	3156000	but you're still a little uncertain and curious
3156000	3158000	then that's a richly meaningful
3158000	3160000	place from a phenomenological perspective
3160000	3162000	and it's like that's the right place
3162000	3164000	to stand. How do you know?
3164000	3166000	Because you want to be alive despite
3166000	3168000	the fact that you're suffering. It's like
3168000	3170000	hey, there's some evidence. You can't get
3170000	3172000	there though without, you know, the initial
3172000	3174000	presupposition that there's something deeply
3174000	3176000	real about meaning and
3176000	3178000	I think real is life sustaining
3178000	3180000	that's part of what real is. That's a
3180000	3182000	Nietzschean idea too. Okay, well
3182000	3184000	let me respond to that.
3184000	3186000	I want to push back on you on that a bit
3186000	3188000	because I think that's not being fair to
3188000	3190000	Nagle's argument because the point Nagle was trying
3190000	3192000	to make is, you know, you said
3192000	3194000	that's a stupid place to stand. It depends on what you're trying
3194000	3196000	to achieve. Right, if you're trying to do
3196000	3198000	science and you're trying to reduce
3198000	3200000	the way we self-deceptively
3200000	3202000	project bias onto the world
3202000	3204000	then you progressively move to
3204000	3206000	these higher views because
3206000	3208000	every time you, I mean
3208000	3210000	that is what we do. That is how we try to reduce
3210000	3212000	bias. I mean, when I can take a
3212000	3214000	the reason I, it's good for me to take
3214000	3216000	a perspective on my lower-order perspective
3216000	3218000	is it helps me to determine bias
3218000	3220000	and distortion in this perspective.
3220000	3222000	So if I want to remove bias and distortion
3222000	3224000	if I want to get at reality and truth
3224000	3226000	and let's assume we have that platonic drive
3226000	3228000	then that feeds into
3228000	3230000	this drive to go higher and higher
3230000	3232000	and higher and higher
3232000	3234000	because as I go higher and higher and higher
3234000	3236000	I am removing distortion. I am
3236000	3238000	removing illusion.
3238000	3240000	That seems to me to be, that's
3240000	3242000	partly why I'm a pragmatist, fundamentally
3242000	3244000	and it's because you're right
3244000	3246000	about that. Yeah, but pragmatism
3246000	3248000	is parasitic on an independent notion of truth.
3248000	3250000	You have to be able to know
3250000	3252000	independent of its usefulness that
3252000	3254000	something is useful.
3254000	3256000	You have to have some way of saying
3256000	3258000	I know that it's true that this
3258000	3260000	is useful, that my perception
3260000	3262000	of its usefulness is not itself distorted.
3262000	3264000	Okay, I'm not disagreeing with that at all.
3264000	3266000	I think that what
3266000	3268000	correct me if I'm wrong.
3268000	3270000	You basically
3270000	3272000	you seem to be making an argument that goes
3272000	3274000	something like this, is that
3274000	3276000	there are different lenses and different
3276000	3278000	levels of resolution for different tasks.
3278000	3280000	That's right. I agree with that.
3280000	3282000	Absolutely. But I'm also making the argument
3282000	3284000	that
3284000	3286000	the drive towards the view from nowhere
3286000	3288000	has just as deep
3288000	3290000	a purchase on us. That platonic quest
3290000	3292000	to get at the
3292000	3294000	the undistorted. We shouldn't
3294000	3296000	be assuming that nowhere is the ultimate
3296000	3298000	stance. It's like it has
3298000	3300000	its zone of relevance and you've laid
3300000	3302000	that out quite nicely. That's exactly what
3302000	3304000	I'm saying. But what I'm trying to say is
3304000	3306000	just to say to someone
3306000	3308000	don't go as far
3308000	3310000	as you can because you might
3310000	3312000	fall into absurdity
3314000	3316000	to me sounds like
3316000	3318000	well, give into
3318000	3320000	self deception because
3320000	3322000	that will be comforting.
3322000	3324000	I guess this is partly
3324000	3326000	my experience as
3326000	3328000	a clinician speaking as well.
3328000	3330000	Because sometimes people get overwhelmed
3330000	3332000	by absurdity. They don't go there.
3332000	3334000	You know what I mean? It's not the right place
3334000	3336000	for them to be. But I would also say
3336000	3338000	that you shouldn't pick problems that are bigger
3338000	3340000	than the ones that you can solve.
3340000	3342000	I disagree with you.
3342000	3344000	We've got to clarify that because I don't think that you
3344000	3346000	I mean we're doing that right now.
3346000	3348000	I know.
3348000	3350000	I know. But we're also
3350000	3352000	not claiming to have the answer.
3352000	3354000	But that value as I said from the beginning
3354000	3356000	isn't in the answer. But in the
3356000	3358000	self-transcendent transformation of the question.
3358000	3360000	And what I
3360000	3362000	was trying to say
3362000	3364000	is that
3366000	3368000	yes, I agree that
3368000	3370000	right
3370000	3372000	I don't think
3372000	3374000	absurdity is caused by
3374000	3376000	the fact that you're
3376000	3378000	the highest level. I mean again
3378000	3380000	that's not Navel's point. Absurdity is caused
3380000	3382000	by the fact that we can
3382000	3384000	find a clash between any
3384000	3386000	two levels we pick. He gives this example.
3386000	3388000	Okay. Okay. So
3388000	3390000	he gives this example and
3390000	3392000	please understand this because we're
3392000	3394000	older than you. There was a time
3394000	3396000	there was a time when people's
3396000	3398000	phones were in specific
3398000	3400000	locations.
3400000	3402000	And if somebody called
3402000	3404000	you you were often not with your phone
3404000	3406000	and so you had to have a recording device
3406000	3408000	to pick up the messages.
3408000	3410000	I know we had just discovered
3410000	3412000	fire but that's what it was like.
3412000	3414000	So he gives the example from
3414000	3416000	that time because he wrote the article in the early 80s
3416000	3418000	and so there's this individual
3418000	3420000	he calls up and they're like
3420000	3422000	and he picks up the here's the pickup
3422000	3424000	and he says he's been all prepared. He says
3424000	3426000	Susan, just don't talk. I got to
3426000	3428000	tell you this. I got to get it out. I
3428000	3430000	love you. I've loved you for a long time. It's really
3430000	3432000	interesting. And then he hears
3432000	3434000	Susan's not here right now.
3434000	3436000	Please leave a message.
3436000	3438000	And you're laughing because
3438000	3440000	humor is also about this juxtaposition
3440000	3442000	of perspectives.
3442000	3444000	And what's happened is that
3444000	3446000	act that seems so meaningful from
3446000	3448000	one's perspective is completely
3448000	3450000	inconsistent with the machine's
3450000	3452000	perspective, the recording
3452000	3454000	machine. It's the clash between
3454000	3456000	perspectives, not a particular
3456000	3458000	perspective per se
3458000	3460000	that I think is what the experience of
3460000	3462000	absurdity is. It could be and
3462000	3464000	but it might be or.
3464000	3466000	Well, I think no because
3466000	3468000	here's why I would challenge you. Okay, okay.
3468000	3470000	Because I would put Spinoza against
3470000	3472000	Nietzsche. Spinoza advocating
3472000	3474000	advocated going to that highest
3474000	3476000	view and then found a way to reconcile
3476000	3478000	it with the lowest perspective
3478000	3480000	the engaged perspective and he said that was
3480000	3482000	the blessed life. Okay, okay. So he argued
3482000	3484000	that the, I mean I think
3484000	3486000	that's why The Ethics is a great book that deserves
3486000	3488000	to be read in contrast to Nietzsche, right?
3488000	3490000	Is he argued that there
3490000	3492000	is a way to reconcile
3492000	3494000	those two perspectives. He called it
3494000	3496000	Scantia Intuitiva. And it's the
3496000	3498000	reconciliation of those two perspectives
3498000	3500000	that alleviates absurdity.
3500000	3502000	Not the preclusion of going to one
3502000	3504000	or the remaining in fixed in the other.
3504000	3506000	And I think that that's very
3506000	3508000	in a very, that's very similar
3508000	3510000	in some profoundly important ways.
3510000	3512000	There's important historical differences to what Buddhism
3512000	3514000	is trying to advocate.
3514000	3516000	Buddhism is about
3516000	3518000	you know, in meditative practice
3518000	3520000	we practice sort of going deeply immersive
3520000	3522000	and in contemplative practice we go
3522000	3524000	deeply out and then the point in Buddhism
3524000	3526000	is that those are supposed to become
3526000	3528000	eventually completely interpenetrating
3528000	3530000	so that the absurdity that's caused by the clash
3530000	3532000	between perspectives is removed.
3532000	3534000	I think the fault, as you said earlier
3534000	3536000	is not in any perspective but in the
3536000	3538000	self-consciousness that pits perspectives
3538000	3540000	against each other. Good, that's very nice.
3540000	3542000	That's very nice. I mean I think that's a very
3542000	3544000	good one. And I
3544000	3546000	take no issue with it.
3546000	3548000	I want to take that line of reasoning
3548000	3550000	in a different direction. We'll
3550000	3552000	play that same line of
3552000	3554000	logic in another way.
3554000	3556000	So Victor was
3556000	3558000	asking earlier, and it's a level
3558000	3560000	of resolution perspective again. It's like
3560000	3562000	okay, well this is really great, it's the meaning
3562000	3564000	of the glass. It's like well yeah, what does
3564000	3566000	that have to do with the meaning of life?
3566000	3568000	I think the person who answered
3568000	3570000	that best actually was Piaget.
3570000	3572000	Let me tell you a little bit about Piaget
3572000	3574000	because the first thing about
3574000	3576000	he was a famous child developmental psychologist
3576000	3578000	by the way, the most famous of the 20th
3578000	3580000	century. He was actually
3580000	3582000	trying to solve the
3582000	3584000	conflict between religion and science.
3584000	3586000	You never hear that about Piaget but he had
3586000	3588000	messianic experiences when he was a young
3588000	3590000	man and he wrote a novel about it and he wanted
3590000	3592000	to reconcile religion and science.
3592000	3594000	He actually did a pretty damn
3594000	3596000	good job.
3596000	3598000	So here's the issue
3598000	3600000	and you can think about it this way. So this is how
3600000	3602000	a baby builds himself or herself
3602000	3604000	up.
3604000	3606000	So learn to move
3606000	3608000	finger.
3608000	3610000	Learn to move hand.
3610000	3612000	Learn to move hand and arms.
3612000	3614000	Learn to move body, hand, arms,
3614000	3616000	legs and feet. Learn to orient
3616000	3618000	head.
3618000	3620000	Learn to use integrated body
3620000	3622000	to
3622000	3624000	undertake independent tasks.
3624000	3626000	Then
3626000	3628000	learn to use integrated body that can
3628000	3630000	undertake independent tasks in
3630000	3632000	concert with another integrated
3632000	3634000	body that can undertake
3634000	3636000	specific tasks. You do that when
3636000	3638000	you play a game. The game is
3638000	3640000	we'll say the game is
3640000	3642000	we're two little girls having
3642000	3644000	tea. So what's the goal?
3644000	3646000	The goal is that we learn how
3646000	3648000	to be mutually
3648000	3650000	respectful while we're sharing
3650000	3652000	nourishment, which is a big deal by the way.
3652000	3654000	It's something humans are unbelievably good
3654000	3656000	at. It's extremely sophisticated.
3656000	3658000	We're very social eaters, so if we're
3658000	3660000	not eating socially, we're fat
3660000	3662000	or anorexic. We
3662000	3664000	have to eat socially to regulate our
3664000	3666000	own behavior because we're social eaters.
3666000	3668000	And so we're learning how to play
3668000	3670000	the game of sharing food.
3670000	3672000	But the game has other rules than that.
3672000	3674000	It's like we're learning how to play the game of sharing food
3674000	3676000	in a way so that we're playing the game
3676000	3678000	so that we want the game to continue.
3678000	3680000	So that's an important
3680000	3682000	point. And then if we get more
3682000	3684000	educated, then we say we're learning to play
3684000	3686000	the game so that it's enjoyable
3686000	3688000	for a larger number of people
3688000	3690000	in a larger number of situations
3690000	3692000	across larger spans of time.
3692000	3694000	And so that's a hierarchical
3694000	3696000	organization of fundamental abilities
3696000	3698000	into
3698000	3700000	solutions that have generalizability
3700000	3702000	across more and more contexts.
3702000	3704000	Now Piaget built that way
3704000	3706000	up. And he said
3706000	3708000	this is associated with this idea of
3708000	3710000	levels too.
3710000	3712000	Piaget believed, and this is
3712000	3714000	his scientific justification for
3714000	3716000	emergent morality in some sense,
3716000	3718000	is that
3718000	3720000	it's within a Darwinian framework, again,
3720000	3722000	not within a Newtonian framework. So Piaget
3722000	3724000	had a proposition, and the proposition
3724000	3726000	was this.
3726000	3728000	You're the bully at the moment.
3728000	3730000	Victor and I are having tea.
3730000	3732000	And you want us to play a different game.
3732000	3734000	You want us to play, I don't know
3734000	3736000	what do you want us to play? Pull the cat's tail.
3736000	3738000	You're a bully after all.
3738000	3740000	And so
3740000	3742000	we don't want to play pull the cat's tail.
3742000	3744000	And so what do you
3744000	3746000	have to do? Well, you have to
3746000	3748000	expend a lot of time and energy
3748000	3750000	enforcing the game. And the reason you have to do
3750000	3752000	that is because we don't want to play the damn game,
3752000	3754000	so we're going to do everything we can
3754000	3756000	to stop you, to subvert it.
3756000	3758000	And so what that means is that you're going to
3758000	3760000	and we're going to expend a tremendous
3760000	3762000	amount of energy in a pursuit
3762000	3764000	where we could have picked a pursuit
3764000	3766000	where there was virtually no energy spent
3766000	3768000	or resources. So Piaget's idea
3768000	3770000	was that an
3770000	3772000	equilibrated game,
3772000	3774000	which is a game that everyone will play voluntarily,
3774000	3776000	if you pit that
3776000	3778000	in an open competition, you could say a Darwinian
3778000	3780000	competition, against
3780000	3782000	a disequilibrated game that requires
3782000	3784000	force to maintain your basic
3784000	3786000	totalitarian state, if you pit
3786000	3788000	those in a one-to-one competition or your
3788000	3790000	totalitarian personality, if you
3790000	3792000	pit them in a one-to-one competition
3792000	3794000	in relationship to the attainment
3794000	3796000	of virtually any goal across
3796000	3798000	multiple contexts, the equilibrated
3798000	3800000	game will win.
3800000	3802000	And that's why it's better.
3802000	3804000	And there's other reasons too. It's better because
3804000	3806000	it isn't only a solution
3806000	3808000	to a problem that's posed in one place.
3808000	3810000	It's a meta-solution
3810000	3812000	to a meta-problem that's posed in many places.
3812000	3814000	I'll just give one example.
3814000	3816000	Okay, so
3816000	3818000	you all tell your kids
3818000	3820000	be a good sport.
3820000	3822000	And your kids, being intelligent kids, think
3822000	3824000	well, don't we want to win this game?
3824000	3826000	It's like, of course
3826000	3828000	you want to win the game. Okay, so why can't
3828000	3830000	I bash the guy next to me over the head with
3830000	3832000	my hockey stick, as long as I don't get caught?
3832000	3834000	That's a Canadian example, right?
3834000	3836000	So I'll tell you a story.
3836000	3838000	I went to this hockey game once, and my son
3838000	3840000	was playing, and that was really fun.
3840000	3842000	And he was in a, like, the final
3842000	3844000	game, and
3844000	3846000	there was a kid on his team who was
3846000	3848000	he was a great hockey player, very, very good
3848000	3850000	hockey player. But
3850000	3852000	it was all him, man.
3852000	3854000	He had the puck he wouldn't pass, and he was
3854000	3856000	pretty good at scoring and so on, but he wasn't
3856000	3858000	playing with the team, and he was
3858000	3860000	playing to win. It was fine, fine, fine.
3860000	3862000	So my son's
3862000	3864000	team lost. It was a great game. I think it
3864000	3866000	was, like, four to three at the end, and the
3866000	3868000	other team scored in the last 30 seconds or whatever.
3868000	3870000	And then all the kids came off the
3870000	3872000	ice, and the parent of this
3872000	3874000	one kid, who's like the little hero
3874000	3876000	hockey player, comes up to him, and
3876000	3878000	the kid had, like, smashed his stick against
3878000	3880000	the cement, and he was all
3880000	3882000	running around and cursing the referees,
3882000	3884000	and the father
3884000	3886000	came running up to him and said,
3886000	3888000	you were robbed. You know, you absolutely should
3888000	3890000	have won that. And I thought,
3890000	3892000	you're such an idiot.
3892000	3894000	And he was, he was truly
3894000	3896000	an idiot, and a pathological
3896000	3898000	one at that. And he was
3898000	3900000	really destroying his child's soul.
3900000	3902000	And here's, this is
3902000	3904000	not funny. It's true. That is what
3904000	3906000	he was doing. I saw it happen over a long
3906000	3908000	time. That was just a microcosm
3908000	3910000	of their relationship and his attitude towards
3910000	3912000	the world. Now, why was that
3912000	3914000	wrong? It's like, the kid
3914000	3916000	wanted to win. It's like, yay, go
3916000	3918000	man, went to win. He was a
3918000	3920000	really good hockey player.
3920000	3922000	So what was wrong with what the father
3922000	3924000	did? Okay. So then we step
3924000	3926000	back and we say, it's
3926000	3928000	not important whether you win or lose. It's how
3928000	3930000	you play the game. So what does that
3930000	3932000	mean? Well, it doesn't actually
3932000	3934000	mean what it says, because it actually is important
3934000	3936000	whether you win or lose. You should be trying
3936000	3938000	to win. But then
3938000	3940000	the question is,
3940000	3942000	what are you trying to win?
3942000	3944000	Now, then that
3944000	3946000	gets complicated. It's like
3946000	3948000	while you're trying to win
3948000	3950000	being the best hockey player on your team,
3950000	3952000	are you trying to win that hockey game?
3952000	3954000	Or are you
3954000	3956000	trying to win the opportunity to be
3956000	3958000	invited to play as many games as
3958000	3960000	you can possibly play with as many people
3960000	3962000	in as many contexts as you possibly
3962000	3964000	can across the entire course
3964000	3966000	of your life? Okay.
3966000	3968000	That's what winning means.
3968000	3970000	And so the rule is
3970000	3972000	don't win the
3972000	3974000	local and proximal event
3974000	3976000	at the price of being a
3976000	3978000	player in the multitude of
3978000	3980000	iterable games. That's the moral principle.
3980000	3982000	You know? Don't put
3982000	3984000	the cart before the horse, so to speak.
3984000	3986000	And the reason for that is that
3986000	3988000	a game is a microcosm of life.
3988000	3990000	That's a Piagetian idea, which is why,
3990000	3992000	by the way, we like games and we'll watch
3992000	3994000	them and we're thrilled about them and we engage
3994000	3996000	in them all the time. But the game
3996000	3998000	isn't the issue.
3998000	4000000	The issue in some sense is the set
4000000	4002000	of all possible games.
4002000	4004000	And the most moral action is
4004000	4006000	the action that will enable you to have
4006000	4008000	the highest probability of winning
4008000	4010000	the set of all possible games.
4010000	4012000	And it's even a little more complicated than that,
4012000	4014000	which is you have to be
4014000	4016000	a player in the set of all possible
4016000	4018000	games in a manner that supports the
4018000	4020000	existence of as many games as possible.
4020000	4022000	And that's, and so
4022000	4024000	you see what I mean, and human beings can do that
4024000	4026000	because we can go up that damn chain
4026000	4028000	of abstraction, right? We don't have to
4028000	4030000	just concentrate on this
4030000	4032000	or a game of let's make
4032000	4034000	tea, you know? We can play these metagames
4034000	4036000	and pose these metag questions.
4036000	4038000	And one of Piaget's claims was
4038000	4040000	don't kid yourself
4040000	4042000	about this. There are rules.
4042000	4044000	There are rules. There are rules for games.
4044000	4046000	There's lots that aren't playable.
4046000	4048000	The rule for a sustainable game is
4048000	4050000	everybody wants to play.
4050000	4052000	Now, another rule is that some people get
4052000	4054000	to try to win, you know?
4054000	4056000	So, but obviously
4056000	4058000	that's not where the abstraction level
4058000	4060000	tops out. And so I love that.
4060000	4062000	It's like, oh, that's so cool.
4062000	4064000	There's a hierarchy of moral value
4064000	4066000	because that's action orientation.
4066000	4068000	And it's an emergent property of the way
4068000	4070000	that complex systems organize themselves.
4070000	4072000	They're basically dominance hierarchies, by the way.
4072000	4074000	And not only that, that
4074000	4076000	system of organization has been around
4076000	4078000	for so long, and I think it's
4078000	4080000	about 400 million years,
4080000	4082000	that we're actually biologically
4082000	4084000	adapted to that structure.
4084000	4086000	Because we know that there are dominance hierarchies
4086000	4088000	that can sustain themselves quite nicely across time.
4088000	4090000	And those usually value
4090000	4092000	the individual and the relationship between
4092000	4094000	the individual and society.
4094000	4096000	And there's those that don't. And we're really
4096000	4098000	adapted to the ones that do because those are
4098000	4100000	the ones in which we live when we live.
4100000	4102000	And so this is deeply biological
4102000	4104000	and it's also emergent at the same time.
4104000	4106000	So it's a testament to your notion
4106000	4108000	that it is
4108000	4110000	necessary to be able to reconcile
4110000	4112000	the local view with the ultimate view.
4112000	4114000	And the more you can ensure that those
4114000	4116000	levels aren't in conflict with one another,
4116000	4118000	that's exactly what a Piagetian
4118000	4120000	equilibrating state is. Is that the union
4120000	4122000	has been attained across the multiple levels
4122000	4124000	of hierarchical organization.
4124000	4126000	That's...
4128000	4130000	Take that.
4130000	4132000	I will take it. You know
4132000	4134000	that I've always liked
4134000	4136000	this argument of yours. I think it's one of your best.
4136000	4138000	And
4138000	4140000	which is not a left handed insult of your other argument.
4140000	4142000	I really like this
4142000	4144000	argument. I think it's a good work.
4144000	4146000	And I've thought about it and I want to share
4146000	4148000	some thoughts I have about it with you.
4148000	4150000	I thought, I think that
4150000	4152000	and this is to allude back to
4152000	4154000	Spinoza again in contrast to Nietzsche,
4154000	4156000	I think
4156000	4158000	then again this is the platonic insight.
4158000	4160000	I mean because Plato of course had
4160000	4162000	a metaphor also for
4162000	4164000	this moving up the levels. It's the metaphor
4164000	4166000	of coming out of the cave into the real world.
4166000	4168000	And I think what I
4168000	4170000	want to say is the highest level
4170000	4172000	of the metagame is the game
4172000	4174000	because games are again things that exist
4174000	4176000	between us and the world, right?
4176000	4178000	I think the highest
4178000	4180000	level of the metagame is the game
4180000	4182000	of intelligibility.
4182000	4184000	I mean I think
4184000	4186000	what we have to have
4186000	4188000	ultimately, and this is what Habermas was
4188000	4190000	on about, right? You have to have
4190000	4192000	shareable intelligibility
4192000	4194000	to do. That's the highest
4194000	4196000	thing. We have to constantly
4196000	4198000	be committed to that.
4198000	4200000	That the grounding
4200000	4202000	normativity of all of our moral
4202000	4204000	normativities is actually
4204000	4206000	this normative demand make things
4206000	4208000	intelligible. And I think
4208000	4210000	So do you think about that as a
4210000	4212000	precondition for the emergence
4212000	4214000	of cooperative games? Yes. So it's like
4214000	4216000	getting the rules straight.
4216000	4218000	Getting the language by which you can
4218000	4220000	formulate the rules straight
4220000	4222000	and using language in a very extended
4222000	4224000	metaphor. And so
4224000	4226000	I think
4226000	4228000	part of the issue for us, though as human
4228000	4230000	beings, is
4230000	4232000	that we do have this drive to
4232000	4234000	get at what is, try to
4234000	4236000	to get the
4236000	4238000	maximal intelligibility project. And I think
4238000	4240000	science tries to do that in some ways.
4240000	4242000	But
4242000	4244000	the problem is that we then
4244000	4246000	and let me talk for a couple
4246000	4248000	minutes on this. We hit
4248000	4250000	a kind of perennial problem. We have
4250000	4252000	these two different notions
4252000	4254000	vis-a-vis intelligibility about what
4254000	4256000	realness is. And I thought, I wanted
4256000	4258000	to ask you about this because I want to know if this lines up
4258000	4260000	with your chaos order thing.
4260000	4262000	We have one notion of
4262000	4264000	realness that what to say
4264000	4266000	that something is real is to say
4266000	4268000	that it is coherent,
4268000	4270000	it is confirmed,
4270000	4272000	it is coherent. Things have
4272000	4274000	come together, right?
4274000	4276000	And there's this mutual
4276000	4278000	fittedness. And then we also
4278000	4280000	have a notion that no, what's real
4280000	4282000	is what catches us by surprise.
4282000	4284000	What was outside of our system
4284000	4286000	and that what we didn't know
4286000	4288000	right? And that's when we get at reality.
4288000	4290000	So we have these two notions of realness
4290000	4292000	and I think we have two for very
4292000	4294000	good reason by the way. I think we
4294000	4296000	actually have three.
4296000	4298000	Those are two of them for sure.
4298000	4300000	So I think what we have is we do have
4300000	4302000	this confirmation notion
4302000	4304000	and then we have this
4304000	4306000	surprise notion. And science
4306000	4308000	tries to pit the two against each other.
4308000	4310000	So what you try to do is you try
4310000	4312000	and do the theory part which is all the
4312000	4314000	confirming coherence part. And then you run
4314000	4316000	experiments in which the world can
4316000	4318000	basically make you go, oh shit.
4318000	4320000	And then you've got to, oh, right?
4320000	4322000	At the level you wanted to.
4322000	4324000	Yes, of course. You don't want to burn down
4324000	4326000	your lab. Or you don't want to horrify yourself
4326000	4328000	oh my god flowers can talk or something like that.
4328000	4330000	Yeah, too much chemistry there.
4330000	4332000	Right.
4332000	4334000	And so
4334000	4336000	part of the problem though
4336000	4338000	is that although science in one sense
4338000	4340000	tended to try to
4340000	4342000	science is largely
4342000	4344000	to some degree a psychotechnology of trying to
4344000	4346000	integrate those two together so that they work coherently
4346000	4348000	for us but also surprisingly
4348000	4350000	for us. Part of the problem
4350000	4352000	though is when Descartes, and I guess I'll put
4352000	4354000	Descartes before the horse here, is
4354000	4356000	what? Is that Nietzsche's horse?
4356000	4358000	Yeah.
4358000	4360000	We were talking about putting the cart before the horse.
4360000	4362000	I was like, Nietzsche,
4362000	4364000	Descartes did something
4364000	4366000	he really exacerbated those two
4366000	4368000	and he put a chasm between them.
4368000	4370000	He said, look, what's real
4370000	4372000	is sort of what's
4372000	4374000	externally measurable
4374000	4376000	by mathematics. So the mathematical
4376000	4378000	properties are the real properties
4378000	4380000	and all the subjective ones are just in my head.
4380000	4382000	But then he said this opposite thing.
4382000	4384000	You know what's most real? My mind.
4384000	4386000	And how it touches itself.
4386000	4388000	And this is completely
4388000	4390000	inexplicable. It's just this direct contact
4390000	4392000	thing. So, and then what he said is
4392000	4394000	right?
4394000	4396000	He didn't ever try to reconcile them
4396000	4398000	and so what we've done in the West
4398000	4400000	is we careen between these two different senses
4400000	4402000	of realness. We careen between
4402000	4404000	real is the mathematical out there-ness.
4404000	4406000	No, no, real is the subjective
4406000	4408000	inhere-ness. And you can always
4408000	4410000	pit one against the opposite because
4410000	4412000	this could all be a dream.
4412000	4414000	Right? Oh, no, no.
4414000	4416000	If it was a dream, you'd be naked.
4418000	4420000	So I'm a naked bully.
4420000	4422000	Okay, so
4422000	4424000	but of course
4424000	4426000	then we do the opposite and say,
4426000	4428000	oh, no, that's just an illusion. You're just
4428000	4430000	dreaming and we do the opposite thing.
4430000	4432000	And so what I'm suggesting
4432000	4434000	has happened is
4434000	4436000	our attempts to
4436000	4438000	our attempts to
4438000	4440000	ground or get a clear purchase
4440000	4442000	on the metagame
4442000	4444000	are exacerbated
4444000	4446000	by the perennial problem
4446000	4448000	that we have these two conflicting notions of
4448000	4450000	realness. Right? Yeah.
4450000	4452000	And then the historical problem that
4452000	4454000	Descartes basically
4454000	4456000	put this chasm between these
4456000	4458000	two different notions. He created
4458000	4460000	Cartesian dualism. There's
4460000	4462000	these two worlds. This is subjective world
4462000	4464000	and the objective world, they share no properties.
4464000	4466000	There's no way to reconcile. And what we do
4466000	4468000	is we constantly there. We constantly
4468000	4470000	undermine. Our notion of
4470000	4472000	realness is rendered permanently
4472000	4474000	unstable. And so
4474000	4476000	I'm not at all challenging you
4476000	4478000	to understand that. I feel like you've just
4478000	4480000	like, tossed me a pumpkin in slow motion
4480000	4482000	so I can bat it out of the park.
4482000	4484000	Okay, well let me just
4484000	4486000	finish and then I'll let you hit the pumpkin.
4486000	4488000	Um,
4488000	4490000	so once again
4490000	4492000	what I'm trying to indicate is
4492000	4494000	I think you're right. I think
4494000	4496000	I think it deeply
4496000	4498000	matters to us to reconcile
4498000	4500000	the meta
4500000	4502000	game and the highest meta game I think is
4502000	4504000	the realness game against the lower game
4504000	4506000	and and and I think
4506000	4508000	that is the grounding of our our
4508000	4510000	moral drive. I think that is deeply right.
4510000	4512000	Now what I'm suggesting to you
4512000	4514000	is there's a perennial problem given
4514000	4516000	our sort of fundamental epistemic
4516000	4518000	machinery that undermines
4518000	4520000	our sense of realness
4520000	4522000	and that is interacting with a historical
4522000	4524000	factor
4524000	4526000	Descartes separation of the two worlds
4526000	4528000	and those are now reinforcing each other in a vicious
4528000	4530000	way in our time so that
4530000	4532000	we can't get a stable enough
4532000	4534000	notion of realness so that
4534000	4536000	we can bring about the very reconciliation
4536000	4538000	that you say we long for
4538000	4540000	and we need and that's part and parcel of
4540000	4542000	what I mean when I say we're in a meaning crisis.
4542000	4544000	It's great. It's great.
4544000	4546000	That's the other one I think. So, okay,
4546000	4548000	so
4548000	4550000	you know
4550000	4552000	there's this there's this brand of psychological
4552000	4554000	thinking that's basically based in
4554000	4556000	Freud via a guy named Ernest Becker
4556000	4558000	who wrote a book called The Denial of Death
4558000	4560000	in the 1970s and it won a Pulitzer Prize
4560000	4562000	it's a pretty good book and it takes
4562000	4564000	Freud's idea that
4564000	4566000	religion is a
4566000	4568000	defense against death anxiety
4568000	4570000	and it develops that
4570000	4572000	in a very intelligent and comprehensive manner
4572000	4574000	so Becker was trying to update Freudian
4574000	4576000	psychoanalytic theory and kind of had the last
4576000	4578000	word on it and I really think he did that. It's a brilliant
4578000	4580000	book but it's really wrong.
4580000	4582000	But it's wrong in a great way which is something
4582000	4584000	to say about a book.
4584000	4586000	I'd like to be wrong like that.
4586000	4588000	Yeah, it'd be great to be wrong like that in some important
4588000	4590000	way. Yeah, absolutely.
4590000	4592000	So, first of all, religion
4592000	4594000	one of religion's diverse and
4594000	4596000	multitudinous functions
4596000	4598000	is that it provides some
4598000	4600000	security
4600000	4602000	against the anxiety of death. It's not the reason
4602000	4604000	for it. It's like you got to beware of people
4604000	4606000	who ever say that one thing
4606000	4608000	is the reason for, you know, that's an
4608000	4610000	ideologue, right? It's like, well, it's all
4610000	4612000	economics. It's all sex. It's all
4612000	4614000	fear. It's like, no, it's not.
4614000	4616000	That's not right and it's simple-minded
4616000	4618000	and it's wrong.
4618000	4620000	So, you know, that's a flaw
4620000	4622000	to some degree in Freudian thinking although he was
4622000	4624000	very smart. He knew about aggression and all sorts
4624000	4626000	of other things. Anyway, it's back to Becker. So there's
4626000	4628000	this idea that
4628000	4630000	our meaning systems
4630000	4632000	that's the internal structure we use to organize
4632000	4634000	the chaos of the world
4634000	4636000	protect us from the anxiety of death.
4636000	4638000	And then, so that's one
4638000	4640000	form of meaning for Becker.
4640000	4642000	And modern mortality salience.
4642000	4644000	Yeah, it's the same thing. That's Becker's.
4644000	4646000	It's an elaboration of Becker. It doesn't
4646000	4648000	really have much to add to Becker, actually.
4648000	4650000	So
4650000	4652000	there's something
4652000	4654000	that's right about that because we do use
4654000	4656000	our belief systems to defend ourselves
4656000	4658000	but we should be very clear about this. Okay,
4658000	4660000	first of all
4660000	4662000	culture is not
4662000	4664000	a belief system.
4664000	4666000	I agree. The representation of culture is a belief
4666000	4668000	system. That is not the same thing.
4668000	4670000	Culture is what's keeping the electricity
4670000	4672000	on. Okay, and that's not
4672000	4674000	defending us against death anxiety,
4674000	4676000	although it is. It's actually defending us
4676000	4678000	against death, which is much better,
4678000	4680000	right, because we're not sitting outside freezing
4680000	4682000	to death. Right, and that's nothing psychological
4682000	4684000	about that. It's like, there are
4684000	4686000	the lights. It's warm. The floor
4686000	4688000	isn't moving. John isn't attacking me.
4688000	4690000	And, you know,
4690000	4692000	seriously, it's like...
4692000	4694000	Right.
4694000	4696000	That's not belief, man. That is that he's not
4696000	4698000	attacking me. And so
4698000	4700000	we represent that belief and that also
4700000	4702000	makes it somewhat
4702000	4704000	pliable and manipulable and fragile
4704000	4706000	because we can also undermine it, but
4706000	4708000	culture protects us from death
4708000	4710000	and the representation of culture
4710000	4712000	protects us sometimes from death anxiety.
4712000	4714000	Okay, so now
4714000	4716000	Becker also pointed out
4716000	4718000	that there was something else that seemed to give life meaning
4718000	4720000	and that was associated with the Cartesian
4720000	4722000	notion of consciousness. So he thought that
4722000	4724000	people were...
4724000	4726000	apart from being protected from
4726000	4728000	terror, which we needed to be,
4728000	4730000	we also needed to convince ourselves
4730000	4732000	that our lives were worthwhile.
4732000	4734000	And we basically did that by deluding
4734000	4736000	ourselves that we were engaged in some
4736000	4738000	sort of heroic project and
4738000	4740000	somehow we could deceive ourselves well
4740000	4742000	enough about the importance of that, through self-deception
4742000	4744000	mostly, that that also added
4744000	4746000	another layer of meaning to our life.
4746000	4748000	Okay, the problem with Becker
4748000	4750000	fundamentally was that he didn't read Jung
4750000	4752000	and he said right in the introduction to his book
4752000	4754000	I've never had any patience for Jung
4754000	4756000	and I never thought he said anything to say about
4756000	4758000	in his books on alchemy and that was
4758000	4760000	really too bad because if he would have read them
4760000	4762000	he would have got the book right instead of wrong.
4762000	4764000	So, so imagine
4764000	4766000	this way instead. So I wrote a paper
4766000	4768000	a while back called Three Kinds of Meaning.
4768000	4770000	Okay, so the one
4770000	4772000	meaning is the meaning that announces
4772000	4774000	itself when something that you don't
4774000	4776000	want to have happen happens.
4776000	4778000	It's not exactly what you don't
4778000	4780000	predict because we don't predict
4780000	4782000	we want.
4782000	4784000	Now, part of wanting
4784000	4786000	is predicting. But if you think
4786000	4788000	about it as predicting, you don't take into account
4788000	4790000	motivation. It's a huge mistake.
4790000	4792000	We're not like cold, cognitive
4792000	4794000	expectations. No, I agree with that.
4794000	4796000	Okay, so sometimes things don't turn out
4796000	4798000	the way we want.
4798000	4800000	That's meaningful. Sometimes
4800000	4802000	the meaning is kind of cool. It's like
4802000	4804000	you make a joke and I didn't expect it. It's like
4804000	4806000	ha ha! And I laugh because I can
4806000	4808000	transcend the unexpected and that's
4808000	4810000	delight in my own capacity for
4810000	4812000	conscious creation, you know. So that feels
4812000	4814000	really good. And I like the joke because
4814000	4816000	of that. So, and that's not an illusion
4816000	4818000	by the way. It's not self-deception.
4818000	4820000	I did transcend the conceptual
4820000	4822000	structure momentarily with you and it's like
4822000	4824000	good for us, you know.
4824000	4826000	So, it's not an illusion.
4826000	4828000	Okay, but now and then something goes
4828000	4830000	unexpected in a way, undesired in a way
4830000	4832000	that we don't like. So, for example
4832000	4834000	you find out that your wife
4834000	4836000	has had like six affairs in the last three
4836000	4838000	months and that she's never been faithful
4838000	4840000	to you at all in the last 20 years.
4840000	4842000	It's like
4842000	4844000	that's rough, man.
4844000	4846000	Especially if you liked her, you know.
4846000	4848000	Ha ha ha!
4848000	4850000	Yeah, well, you know, if you didn't
4850000	4852000	like her, it might be good news.
4852000	4854000	But, and I'm actually
4854000	4856000	serious about that too. But okay, so you think
4856000	4858000	well, how upsetting should
4858000	4860000	that be?
4860000	4862000	It's hard for your nervous system to calibrate that,
4862000	4864000	but here's a rough mode
4864000	4866000	of understanding the calibration.
4866000	4868000	The existence
4868000	4870000	of your faithfulness
4870000	4872000	in your spouse is an axiomatic
4872000	4874000	precondition for a set of models
4874000	4876000	that you erect about how the world
4876000	4878000	will lay itself out in
4878000	4880000	a way that you want to. Which is to say
4880000	4882000	you've modeled a future
4882000	4884000	with this person. It's a future you want
4884000	4886000	and then if she's not there
4886000	4888000	or if her faithfulness is absent,
4888000	4890000	that collapses.
4890000	4892000	But what does it collapse into?
4892000	4894000	It collapses into the unstructured void
4894000	4896000	fundamentally. And that's really hard
4896000	4898000	on you. If you're
4898000	4900000	betrayed like that, this is why betrayers
4900000	4902000	occupy the lowest circle of hell, right?
4902000	4904000	If you're betrayed like that, it's even worse.
4904000	4906000	Your future's gone
4906000	4908000	and that sucks because you put a lot of work
4908000	4910000	into it probably and you need to stabilize
4910000	4912000	the bad thing because it's rife with uncertainty.
4912000	4914000	But then your present is gone
4914000	4916000	too because who the hell
4916000	4918000	is this person you're living with
4918000	4920000	and more to the point, what kind of moron
4920000	4922000	are you? And so that means
4922000	4924000	your model of the most
4924000	4926000	important person in your life
4928000	4930000	is gone, collapses
4930000	4932000	into the void and you have
4932000	4934000	no idea what the hell's up with you
4934000	4936000	either. How could you be so blind? How could you be
4936000	4938000	so naive? How could you be so foolish? How could
4938000	4940000	you be so gullible?
4940000	4942000	How evil is this person? How evil
4942000	4944000	are you? How did you
4944000	4946000	did you instigate
4946000	4948000	this in some unconscious manner? Were you
4948000	4950000	looking for punishment all along?
4950000	4952000	And then there's the whole problem of your past.
4952000	4954000	It's like whatever you thought it was
4954000	4956000	it isn't. It's something completely different.
4956000	4958000	You didn't know who you were with when you were
4958000	4960000	doing all the things that you thought you were doing.
4960000	4962000	So that's a collapse
4962000	4964000	if you think about this game hierarchy
4964000	4966000	we talked about a
4966000	4968000	the stable marriage part of a game
4968000	4970000	hierarchy is way the hell up the abstraction
4970000	4972000	level. And so
4972000	4974000	it decomposes
4974000	4976000	into a very large subset of operations
4976000	4978000	and perceptions. And when you blow
4978000	4980000	that you basically blow out a huge
4980000	4982000	chunk of the personality.
4982000	4984000	And then what shines through that is the
4984000	4986000	void essentially. It's terror.
4986000	4988000	It's depression.
4988000	4990000	And it's not just psychological
4990000	4992000	because you actually don't know where you are
4992000	4994000	who you're with anymore and so the way your body
4994000	4996000	responds to that is by assuming that you've been
4996000	4998000	drop naked into a pit of lions.
4998000	5000000	And really your cortisol levels go way up
5000000	5002000	your heart rate goes it's like you're in a
5002000	5004000	state of chronic chronic
5004000	5006000	horrible stress physiological stress
5006000	5008000	and that will kill you it's not just psychological
5008000	5010000	it hurts your brain it hurts your immune
5010000	5012000	system makes you diabetic
5012000	5014000	it makes you obese it's you name
5014000	5016000	it it's like cortisol is bad news.
5016000	5018000	So your body is
5018000	5020000	estimating the proportion of the territory
5020000	5022000	that you inhabit that has now become
5022000	5024000	uninhabitable right. And so
5024000	5026000	there's a that's the meaning of chaos
5026000	5028000	that's the meaning of chaos and it's an
5028000	5030000	a prior meaning and a lot of it is
5030000	5032000	you should be frozen in terror
5032000	5034000	like you're looking at the Gorgon's face
5034000	5036000	and the other part of it is
5036000	5038000	how wait a minute there's there's a
5038000	5040000	little treasure there too it's like the
5040000	5042000	dragon with the treasure maybe you can stop
5042000	5044000	living a false life right you can put
5044000	5046000	yourself back together you can start living
5046000	5048000	in truth you can find a relationship that's
5048000	5050000	actually genuine and so that's like the
5050000	5052000	that is precisely that the treasure
5052000	5054000	that the dragon guards that's why we have
5054000	5056000	that story by the way and that's also why
5056000	5058000	it's the oldest human story that
5058000	5060000	we know so
5060000	5062000	I suspected it traces itself
5062000	5064000	all the way back to the time 60 million
5064000	5066000	years ago when we were throwing branches at
5066000	5068000	snakes so it's all that
5068000	5070000	story wasn't a story then right it was
5070000	5072000	a pattern of behavior so
5072000	5074000	there's the meaning of chaos
5074000	5076000	and then there's the meaning of order
5076000	5078000	and the meaning of order is the
5078000	5080000	regulation of chaos just so
5080000	5082000	that the meaning that's useful shines
5082000	5084000	through and it's sort of the kind of
5084000	5086000	idea that Huxley had about consciousness
5086000	5088000	as a reducing valve I think that was Berkeley too
5088000	5090000	right was it Berkeley no Berkeley has a different
5090000	5092000	idea okay okay problem had the same idea
5092000	5094000	okay okay so so that's
5094000	5096000	two meanings meaning of order
5096000	5098000	stable security it can tilt
5098000	5100000	towards tyranny if it gets too much
5100000	5102000	and then there's the meaning of chaos which
5102000	5104000	can be horrifying at high levels of
5104000	5106000	abstraction and interesting at lower levels
5106000	5108000	and then there's one other meaning
5108000	5110000	which is the third class and the third
5110000	5112000	class is the meaning that you experience when you're
5112000	5114000	mediating between order and chaos
5114000	5116000	and that's the that's the heroic
5116000	5118000	meaning it's like you're you've got
5118000	5120000	one foot in order so maybe you've got your
5120000	5122000	scientific theory and you know you're out
5122000	5124000	on the edge of that you're on the frontier
5124000	5126000	the scientific frontier and you're
5126000	5128000	poking your beak out into the unknown
5128000	5130000	and as you're doing that you're seeing new
5130000	5132000	patterns and you're you're incorporating
5132000	5134000	them and you're dissolving
5134000	5136000	and reconstituting the whole structure
5136000	5138000	of the known that that is
5138000	5140000	order and that's that's
5140000	5142000	meaningful delight that's when you're doing
5142000	5144000	that you know you're in the right place and
5144000	5146000	you say well what's the meaning of life it's
5146000	5148000	that's we have three there's the meaning
5148000	5150000	of chaos look out
5150000	5152000	it's promise and catastrophe
5152000	5154000	we have the meaning of order
5154000	5156000	that's security and tyranny
5156000	5158000	and then we have the meaning of exploration
5158000	5160000	and that's the hero
5160000	5162000	myth and it's not a false
5162000	5164000	thing it's not self-deception it's like
5164000	5166000	you're out there transforming
5166000	5168000	chaos into order and that's
5168000	5170000	habitable territory for you and everyone
5170000	5172000	else it's like otherwise
5172000	5174000	it's bloody freezing to death and chewing
5174000	5176000	on bones with the dogs you know it's like
5176000	5178000	we don't want to do that
5178000	5180000	so it's not it's not
5180000	5182000	non real and we also don't know
5182000	5184000	how far we can push it like if all of you
5184000	5186000	stayed properly on the
5186000	5188000	border between it order and chaos
5188000	5190000	and we're attempting to
5190000	5192000	rectify in your environment everything
5192000	5194000	you could in a meaningful way it's like
5194000	5196000	God only knows how much better you could
5196000	5198000	make the world and like I would say
5198000	5200000	that's it that there's an ultimatness
5200000	5202000	about that and the
5202000	5204000	ancient Egyptians had figured this out a very
5204000	5206000	long time ago and it was partly for that
5206000	5208000	reason that they worship the God called Horus
5208000	5210000	who is the eye everybody knows
5210000	5212000	the Egyptian eye and both the Egyptians
5212000	5214000	and the Mesopotamians had figured out that
5214000	5216000	the fundamental attribute
5216000	5218000	of the heroic spirit
5218000	5220000	isn't rationality it's the
5220000	5222000	capacity to pay attention
5222000	5224000	and what's so cool about that that's the
5224000	5226000	Cartesian issue right
5226000	5228000	consciousness is the capacity to pay attention
5228000	5230000	and attention looks beyond
5230000	5232000	the pyramid of the known it's the little
5232000	5234000	eye at the top it's looking
5234000	5236000	beyond and it's extending the pyramid
5236000	5238000	and it's transforming the pyramid when it
5238000	5240000	needs to be transformed and everybody
5240000	5242000	can stay safely and nicely it's
5242000	5244000	going inside of that and it stays
5244000	5246000	dynamic so
5246000	5248000	that's really the redemptive meaning
5248000	5250000	I think because
5250000	5252000	you can't be secure
5252000	5254000	you can't
5254000	5256000	you're too fragile and things are too complicated
5256000	5258000	so you can't put your faith in ultimate security
5258000	5260000	that's what totalitarians do
5260000	5262000	and that doesn't work it just turns
5262000	5264000	genocidal so what can you
5264000	5266000	put your faith in
5266000	5268000	well
5268000	5270000	you can put your faith and it's not even
5270000	5272000	faith it's an observable phenomena
5274000	5276000	concentrate
5276000	5278000	on doing things that are meaningful
5278000	5280000	that you can do
5280000	5282000	they'll announce themselves to you it's like
5282000	5284000	you have something's bugging you it's like fix it
5284000	5286000	you'll find that that's quite meaningful
5286000	5288000	so and that meaning redeems you
5288000	5290000	right in that moment because
5290000	5292000	if it's meaningful enough
5292000	5294000	you're not self-conscious
5294000	5296000	and anxious and hurt and suffering and
5296000	5298000	devastated you're like on top
5298000	5300000	of the game and so then you might say
5300000	5302000	well what if you just stayed there all the time
5302000	5304000	well then problem solved
5304000	5306000	so and you might say
5306000	5308000	well no that's fine say it
5308000	5310000	but you could try it
5310000	5312000	that's the thing that's so cool about this it's actually
5312000	5314000	this is kind of an existential argument
5314000	5316000	in some sense it's like
5316000	5318000	you can run the experiment
5318000	5320000	I tell my students all the time
5322000	5324000	watch your life
5324000	5326000	see what you're doing that's really
5326000	5328000	low quality and meaningless
5328000	5330000	that you could just stop doing
5330000	5332000	so you don't have to answer ultimate
5332000	5334000	questions to do that it's like
5334000	5336000	it's not what is truth
5336000	5338000	it's what is falsehood
5338000	5340000	and it's way easier to figure out what falsehood
5340000	5342000	is than truth so if you're doing
5342000	5344000	stupid moronic things that hurt you and your family
5344000	5346000	and you know it and you could stop
5346000	5348000	and you think you might stop
5348000	5350000	which is quite a set of constraints right
5350000	5352000	then stop
5352000	5354000	and then see what happens
5354000	5356000	and the first thing that'll happen is that things will tilt a bit
5356000	5358000	little less chaos
5358000	5360000	little more order little more freedom from you
5360000	5362000	for you
5362000	5364000	so sometimes it's the opposite
5364000	5366000	it's like you've got your family around the neck
5366000	5368000	it's like don't do anything I don't want you to do
5368000	5370000	it's like tyrant you know
5370000	5372000	so then the trick is to loosen up
5372000	5374000	the old tyrant a bit and get a little more chaos
5374000	5376000	in there and that'll optimize the meaning again
5376000	5378000	and so
5378000	5380000	you said right at the beginning of the discussion
5380000	5382000	that meaning wasn't a proposition
5382000	5384000	that's right and I would say well one form
5384000	5386000	of meaning is propositional that's the orderly
5386000	5388000	meaning
5388000	5390000	but the transcendent form of meaning
5390000	5392000	upon which even order depends
5392000	5394000	is the dynamic
5394000	5396000	meaning making
5396000	5398000	but that's what I meant
5398000	5400000	yeah I know I understand that
5400000	5402000	that's what I was trying to convey with this notion
5402000	5404000	that I think is completely
5404000	5406000	accessible to current cognitive science
5406000	5408000	of this evolving relation
5408000	5410000	I mean because
5410000	5412000	one of the key ideas in the Darwinian model
5412000	5414000	is you integrate
5414000	5416000	you have the chaos
5416000	5418000	you have the opening up of the variations
5418000	5420000	that are often due to mutation
5420000	5422000	and random events
5422000	5424000	and then you have natural selection
5424000	5426000	that is the ordering that's the selection process
5426000	5428000	and then what evolution means
5428000	5430000	is exactly this constant interplay
5430000	5432000	between them and that's what I meant
5432000	5434000	when I think cognition is not
5434000	5436000	a set of beliefs in our head
5436000	5438000	it's the brain's ongoing
5438000	5440000	evolved fittedness to the world
5440000	5442000	and I do think
5442000	5444000	I agree with you that
5444000	5446000	learning to
5446000	5448000	learn what it is to be a wise person
5448000	5450000	is to learn to situate yourself
5450000	5452000	in such a way that that relationship
5452000	5454000	becomes very attuned
5454000	5456000	it becomes very self-propellant
5456000	5458000	it's
5458000	5460000	I think
5460000	5462000	you went to Egyptian
5462000	5464000	but I think it's what Socrates meant when he said
5464000	5466000	wisdom begins in wonder
5466000	5468000	at the point about
5468000	5470000	when we're in a state of wonder
5470000	5472000	and Descartes actually
5472000	5474000	contrary to what a lot of people thought about Descartes
5474000	5476000	we're different from the other animals because we're not
5476000	5478000	motivated just by fear and desire
5478000	5480000	we're motivated also by wonder and that's what makes us unique
5480000	5482000	because wonder is about
5482000	5484000	being on that horizon of intelligibility
5484000	5486000	that moving horizon
5486000	5488000	which behind us
5488000	5490000	is what has been confirmed
5490000	5492000	but in front of us is what has not been explored
5492000	5494000	yes
5494000	5496000	so I do think that
5496000	5498000	that's the Taoist symbol
5498000	5500000	as you know I am a Taoist
5500000	5502000	I practice Tai Chi
5502000	5504000	I do challenge the idea
5504000	5506000	well maybe you used the term a little bit different
5506000	5508000	I do challenge the idea that that is
5508000	5510000	not a rational state
5510000	5512000	I think we have reduced the notion of
5512000	5514000	rationality too much to logical
5514000	5516000	argumentation so for example
5516000	5518000	I would say that the Buddhist notion of mindfulness
5518000	5520000	of reflecting
5520000	5522000	on how we pay attention
5522000	5524000	so that we make it more reliably capable
5524000	5526000	of putting us on that
5526000	5528000	so that we more reliably
5528000	5530000	flourish and achieve our goals
5530000	5532000	is as much a form
5532000	5534000	a cognitive style of rationality
5534000	5536000	as good logical argumentation is
5536000	5538000	precisely because by
5538000	5540000	being on learning how to
5540000	5542000	structure your attention so reliably
5542000	5544000	keeps you on the horizon
5544000	5546000	of wonder is precisely to place yourself
5546000	5548000	in the optimal place for
5548000	5550000	flourishing as a human being that constitutes
5550000	5552000	I think for me a fundamental kind of rationality
5552000	5554000	and we're again giving into the
5554000	5556000	romantic notion that there's this deep
5556000	5558000	dichotomy between you know
5558000	5560000	attention and experience and logic and rationality
5560000	5562000	we should abandon that dichotomy
5562000	5564000	and we should see
5564000	5566000	that there is as much rationality
5566000	5568000	right going on
5568000	5570000	in you know the training of mindfulness
5570000	5572000	as there is in the rationality
5572000	5574000	of training logical argumentation
5574000	5576000	so let look I
5576000	5578000	appreciate what you're saying but I want to point out
5578000	5580000	well let me say because
5580000	5582000	rationality ultimately comes from
5582000	5584000	ratio from rationing it's fundamentally
5584000	5586000	about the logistical distribution
5586000	5588000	of your resources for success
5588000	5590000	right as a human being it's not
5590000	5592000	primarily about
5592000	5594000	the logical ordering of your inferences
5594000	5596000	that's just one way in which we ration
5596000	5598000	one type of our cognitive resource
5598000	5600000	but it is not our most fundamental resource
5600000	5602000	look our behavior is
5602000	5604000	not ultimately and primarily
5604000	5606000	driven by our beliefs beliefs
5606000	5608000	matter they affect our behavior but there's all this
5608000	5610000	stuff outside or below our beliefs
5610000	5612000	that is driving our behavior and what
5612000	5614000	gets most access to that
5614000	5616000	is not our beliefs but what we find salient
5616000	5618000	what we find relevant to bring it back
5618000	5620000	to what I was saying before
5622000	5624000	yes but
5624000	5626000	this is why I want to make this
5626000	5628000	this and like
5628000	5630000	we're circulating around the same set of ideas
5630000	5632000	but there's an important point of clarification
5632000	5634000	here I think
5634000	5636000	so one of the things that you
5636000	5638000	probably all know is that the Catholic
5638000	5640000	church was very skeptical about
5640000	5642000	rationality right and modern
5642000	5644000	people are not very happy about that
5644000	5646000	because they think of that as anti-science
5646000	5648000	in a sense and the sign of
5648000	5650000	like a what a degenerate institution
5650000	5652000	and yeah yeah you can understand that
5652000	5654000	but they had a reason
5654000	5656000	and I figured out this reason when I was studying
5656000	5658000	um
5658000	5660000	Paradise Lost right and the reason was this
5660000	5662000	so the book Paradise Lost
5662000	5664000	came out when
5664000	5666000	it's the great home by John Milton came out
5666000	5668000	roughly speaking when the nation states
5668000	5670000	in Europe were really starting to get going
5670000	5672000	and political ideologies were really
5672000	5674000	trying to starting to structure themselves
5674000	5676000	so they were like secular belief systems
5676000	5678000	and the way I read Milton is that
5678000	5680000	so Lucifer, Satan
5680000	5682000	and Milton's Paradise Lost is
5682000	5684000	he's Lucifer so he's the highest
5684000	5686000	spirit in God's heavenly hierarchy
5686000	5688000	so to speak and he's the bringer of light
5688000	5690000	right and Satan
5690000	5692000	like satanic arrogance is a rational
5692000	5694000	arrogance
5694000	5696000	so what does that mean exactly
5696000	5698000	well let's look at the Soviet Union
5698000	5700000	what happened in the Soviet Union with the communists
5700000	5702000	was that they set up a system
5702000	5704000	of axioms such as from each
5704000	5706000	according to his ability to each according
5706000	5708000	to his need which sound lovely
5708000	5710000	axiomatically true right so
5710000	5712000	their fundamental beliefs
5712000	5714000	and then they erected a rational system
5714000	5716000	on the basis of those axiomatic beliefs
5716000	5718000	that was completely coherent and
5718000	5720000	closed and then they worshiped
5720000	5722000	the ability to make that absolutely coherent
5722000	5724000	and not
5724000	5726000	to have any necessity of stepping
5726000	5728000	outside of it in fact if you stepped outside
5728000	5730000	of it with your own suffering
5730000	5732000	instead of taking into account the fact
5732000	5734000	that your suffering meant that the totalitarian
5734000	5736000	viewpoint was incomplete they just
5736000	5738000	killed you that I was a lot easier
5738000	5740000	than fixing the damn thing and so
5740000	5742000	what Milton intuited was that
5742000	5744000	the rational spirit which is the intelligence
5744000	5746000	of human beings the rational
5746000	5748000	and propositional based intelligence that
5748000	5750000	wants coherence and rigor
5750000	5752000	could be stretched to
5752000	5754000	such a degree that it became a replacement
5754000	5756000	for appreciation of the transcendent
5756000	5758000	which would be the thing outside
5758000	5760000	the known it just replaces that and that's
5760000	5762000	the satanic appropriation
5762000	5764000	of the highest heaven
5764000	5766000	in God's heavenly kingdom
5766000	5768000	you know and Milton's prediction
5768000	5770000	about that was that that turned
5770000	5772000	the rational mind into something that would
5772000	5774000	inevitably rule over hell
5774000	5776000	well that's what happened
5776000	5778000	in the 20th century now
5778000	5780000	I think I don't think
5780000	5782000	rationality is the right term exactly
5782000	5784000	and maybe attention isn't the right
5784000	5786000	term either although I think it's closer
5786000	5788000	I think the right term is logos
5788000	5790000	and logos of course
5790000	5792000	is the root of logic but it's also
5792000	5794000	the root of the idea it's a Christian
5794000	5796000	idea fundamentally although it's expressed
5796000	5798000	in many other religious beliefs
5798000	5800000	of the creative capacity
5800000	5802000	of the investigative
5802000	5804000	creative spirit right so
5804000	5806000	it's investigation and it's the
5806000	5808000	transformation of the consequence of the
5808000	5810000	investigation into fully articulated
5810000	5812000	representation and then it's the sharing
5812000	5814000	of that and so what we're doing
5814000	5816000	right now this is a logos conversation
5816000	5818000	because you're not trying
5818000	5820000	to impose your propositions on me
5820000	5822000	and I'm not trying to impose my propositions
5822000	5824000	on you what we're trying to do
5824000	5826000	is to use the structures that we both have
5826000	5828000	the propositional structures to dance
5828000	5830000	with them and out of the dance
5830000	5832000	to produce something that's
5832000	5834000	emergent and that's dynamic and that's
5834000	5836000	living it's the living spirit
5836000	5838000	actually that's living that's appropriate
5838000	5840000	it's it's historically
5840000	5842000	grounded and precisely appropriate
5842000	5844000	to this time and place
5844000	5846000	and that's the logos and so
5846000	5848000	that's why in complex
5848000	5850000	especially in complex western systems although not
5850000	5852000	only in them the logos
5852000	5854000	is the thing that's not only at the top
5854000	5856000	of the hierarchy of value but it's also
5856000	5858000	the thing that brings order out
5858000	5860000	of chaos at the beginning of time
5860000	5862000	okay I would agree with that you'd be
5862000	5864000	pleased to know that when I talk about this level
5864000	5866000	of the brain
5866000	5868000	and mind in my courses I use the term logos
5868000	5870000	to label it so
5870000	5872000	my students can vouch for me on that
5872000	5874000	and I do agree
5874000	5876000	but I would also point out
5876000	5878000	that logos is also the basis
5878000	5880000	of the word logistical which again is about
5880000	5882000	the distribution of resources
5882000	5884000	right right right absolutely
5884000	5886000	and so what I was proposing to you
5886000	5888000	is that
5888000	5890000	that a Socratic
5890000	5892000	I mean whatever else Socrates
5892000	5894000	was I mean he was open to the transcendent
5894000	5896000	in a very important way
5896000	5898000	but he was also
5898000	5900000	that's why he knew that
5900000	5902000	his not knowing was the most important thing he knew
5902000	5904000	but he did know but see people forget
5904000	5906000	that although Socrates said he didn't
5906000	5908000	know in that sense he said he knew
5908000	5910000	that he did not knew that doesn't mean that he was just ignorant
5910000	5912000	he meant he had what Nicholas of Cusa
5912000	5914000	called learned ignorance he had an inside
5914000	5916000	knowledge of the way in which
5916000	5918000	an inside awareness of the way in which
5918000	5920000	he was limited and
5920000	5922000	and faulted but
5922000	5924000	Socrates did claim to know some things
5924000	5926000	he claimed to know Ta Erotica
5926000	5928000	which didn't mean he was some sort of
5928000	5930000	sexual master
5930000	5932000	he meant he knew what to care about
5932000	5934000	he knew what to find significant
5934000	5936000	he knew that the
5936000	5938000	unexamined life was not worth living
5938000	5940000	and he knew that to such a degree that he was willing to
5940000	5942000	die for that so there
5942000	5944000	was a kind of knowing that he talked about
5944000	5946000	but again it's this
5946000	5948000	knowing about again what to care about
5948000	5950000	what to find relevant what
5950000	5952000	you should what you should direct
5952000	5954000	towards and he saw argumentation
5954000	5956000	not as something antithetical
5956000	5958000	to that process
5958000	5960000	but as something that could deeply support it
5960000	5962000	the Socratic process of
5962000	5964000	Alancas and argumentation was not
5964000	5966000	antithetical to that
5966000	5968000	logos the Deo logos but exactly
5968000	5970000	meant to be constitutive
5970000	5972000	and enhancement enhancing
5972000	5974000	of that very transformation of what
5974000	5976000	we fundamentally care about and what we find
5976000	5978000	most significant and I think it's been a mistake
5978000	5980000	again due to the romantics
5980000	5982000	because most of our mistakes are due to them
5982000	5984000	don't forget the
5984000	5986000	postmodernists
5986000	5988000	fine
5988000	5990000	but what I
5990000	5992000	this putting on
5992000	5994000	one side of argumentation
5994000	5996000	and then putting on the other
5996000	5998000	the other side caring and emotion
5998000	6000000	I mean what's going on in cognitive science
6000000	6002000	right now is exactly I mean
6002000	6004000	neuroscientists like Demasio
6004000	6006000	or Montague were saying
6006000	6008000	this is a false dichotomy that we have
6008000	6010000	saddled ourselves with too long
6010000	6012000	you cannot be a rational being if you're not
6012000	6014000	also a deeply emotional being
6014000	6016000	and you can't be an emotional being
6016000	6018000	if you're not a being that is
6018000	6020000	in some sense doing relevance realisation
6020000	6022000	and rationing its resources
6022000	6024000	they are interdependent
6024000	6026000	and equally interdefining
6026000	6028000	and I think that again ultimately goes to the
6028000	6030000	fact that relevance realisation is not
6030000	6032000	cold calculation it is ultimately
6032000	6034000	also deeply right
6034000	6036000	effective arousing
6036000	6038000	it's salient and again
6038000	6040000	this is what we're trying to do
6040000	6042000	when we talk about the meaning in life
6042000	6044000	we're trying to find
6044000	6046000	those ways
6046000	6048000	of behaving and seeing
6048000	6050000	and paying attention that are rational
6050000	6052000	in the socratic sense
6052000	6054000	of affording that interrelationship
6054000	6056000	between argumentation
6056000	6058000	and caring that again
6058000	6060000	puts us on the horizon
6060000	6062000	of intelligibility puts us in that place
6062000	6064000	where wonder and
6064000	6066000	a flow of insight becomes a primary way
6066000	6068000	into which we try to adaptively respond
6068000	6070000	to a world that will always
6070000	6072000	be beyond our
6072000	6074000	complete cognitive grasp
6074000	6076000	put her there
6076000	6078000	that's good
6086000	6088000	so that seems
6088000	6090000	to be a good end to the
6090000	6092000	debate I think we can
6092000	6094000	we've got about 10 minutes so
6094000	6096000	it might be a good idea to
6096000	6098000	incorporate some of the ideas from the audience
6098000	6100000	I'd like to say one thing first
6100000	6102000	I gave
6102000	6104000	credit to work the idea with Leo Ferraro
6104000	6106000	I also want to point out that a lot of these
6106000	6108000	ideas have not worked out in
6108000	6110000	isolation
6110000	6112000	my good friend Chris master
6112000	6114000	right there is a co-author of a book
6114000	6116000	on a lot of these issues and he's been
6116000	6118000	a co-author in a true sense
6118000	6120000	and so I want to give him credit for some
6120000	6122000	of the arguments and ideas we've often worked
6122000	6124000	these out together
6132000	6134000	it seems like both of you
6134000	6136000	have arrived at the conclusion that
6136000	6138000	a sort of self-reflective
6138000	6140000	disposition that
6140000	6142000	adapts meeting structures
6142000	6144000	dynamically while you live
6144000	6146000	is how you generate proper
6146000	6148000	meeting structures
6148000	6150000	I would like to offer you something to think about
6150000	6152000	this is like a leap way the hell up
6152000	6154000	the abstraction chain
6154000	6156000	you've all seen Pinocchio I presume yes
6156000	6158000	how many have seen Pinocchio
6158000	6160000	you know you're watching like animated
6160000	6162000	drawings of some puppet
6162000	6164000	rescuing his father from a whale right
6164000	6166000	it's like what the hell are you up to by the way
6166000	6168000	so you might think about that for a minute
6168000	6170000	you go into the theater and you watch that
6170000	6172000	and you think oh yeah it's like there's a puppet
6172000	6174000	and you know he goes to an island and then he dives into the ocean
6174000	6176000	with a cricket and then he finds his father in a whale
6176000	6178000	and then a fairy changes him into a boy
6178000	6180000	that all makes sense
6180000	6182000	it's like well no actually
6182000	6184000	it doesn't make any sense at all and what's even
6184000	6186000	more interesting is that you actually don't care
6186000	6188000	whether it makes any sense and that you'd be annoyed
6188000	6190000	at anyone who would point it out
6190000	6192000	so one of the things I would like to point out is that
6192000	6194000	the fundamental theme of Pinocchio is that
6194000	6196000	if you don't rescue
6196000	6198000	your father which is order
6198000	6200000	by the way from the bottom of the sea
6200000	6202000	which is chaos then you can't
6202000	6204000	become a genuine human being
6204000	6206000	and you know we show that to
6206000	6208000	our kids because we know it's true but we're not
6208000	6210000	smart enough to understand it
6210000	6212000	so truly we act out
6212000	6214000	and represent symbolically many things
6214000	6216000	that we cannot articulate and that's in fact
6216000	6218000	what art is for but you know
6218000	6220000	you might walk away from this thinking
6220000	6222000	well you don't believe this sort of thing
6222000	6224000	it's like no you might think that you don't believe it
6224000	6226000	but if you
6226000	6228000	watch how you act you believe it
6228000	6230000	and the only thing you should ever do
6230000	6232000	when you're trying to figure out what someone believes
6232000	6234000	is watch how they act because what they say
6234000	6236000	about themselves is a very
6236000	6238000	pale reflection generally speaking
6238000	6240000	of the actuality that
6240000	6242000	they themselves are
6242000	6244000	you do not comprehend yourself obviously
6244000	6246000	because we wouldn't even need this discussion
6246000	6248000	but
6248000	6250000	well I'll leave it at that
6250000	6252000	I wanted to point that out because the sorts of things
6252000	6254000	that we're talking about are being broadcast
6254000	6256000	at you in many ways all the time
6256000	6258000	and you know the themes
6258000	6260000	what 20th and 21st century philosophy
6260000	6262000	and cognitive science are trying to do
6262000	6264000	when they're doing the deepest thing they can do
6264000	6266000	is to raise these
6266000	6268000	these forms
6268000	6270000	of knowledge that we've acquired
6270000	6272000	over God only knows
6272000	6274000	what length of time up from the depths
6274000	6276000	and to make them articulate
6276000	6278000	and to help us become real and to realize
6278000	6280000	ourselves and like that is the solution
6280000	6282000	to the problem of life in so far
6282000	6284000	as there is a solution
6284000	6286000	and it may well be a sufficient solution
6286000	6288000	socrates thought it was a sufficient solution
6288000	6290000	I agree
6290000	6292000	he felt that his identification
6292000	6294000	with the logos process
6294000	6296000	roughly speaking had given his life so much meaning
6296000	6298000	in depth that when the gods
6298000	6300000	offered him the chance to shuffle off the mortal coil
6300000	6302000	he went and had a little colloquy
6302000	6304000	with his conscience his daemon
6304000	6306000	which was basically logos
6306000	6308000	and it said good job old man
6308000	6310000	maybe it's
6310000	6312000	luck for you you can drink the hemlock
6312000	6314000	you say goodbye to all your friends
6314000	6316000	and all Alzheimer's and the degeneration
6316000	6318000	of your being
6318000	6320000	sayonara and that's why socrates
6320000	6322000	went through the trial and you know
6322000	6324000	we know that story and we know it for a bloody
6324000	6326000	reason it's like he's at the base
6326000	6328000	of our thought structures along with other people
6328000	6330000	so
6330000	6332000	socrates means a great deal to me
6332000	6334000	socrates means a great deal to me
6334000	6336000	socrates means a great deal to me
6336000	6338000	socrates means a great deal to me
6338000	6340000	so there seems to be
6340000	6342000	at least one solution to try to pursue
6342000	6344000	life dan dolderman poses an interesting question
6344000	6346000	which is how can people
6346000	6348000	overcome their resistance to the crushing
6348000	6350000	responsibility that comes with confronting
6350000	6352000	the meeting crisis? Well that's easy
6352000	6354000	try to comprehend the alternative
6354000	6356000	you know you're either aiming for heaven or you're
6356000	6358000	going to end up in hell and it'll happen while
6358000	6360000	you're alive I don't have any idea what'll
6360000	6362000	happen afterwards but like you can see
6362000	6364000	people in hell all the time you just have to
6364000	6366000	look around and so you're either on
6366000	6368000	the path and moving forward and upward and
6368000	6370000	aiming at the right thing or
6370000	6372000	backsliding backwards into a place
6372000	6374000	that is properly conceptualized as
6374000	6376000	eternal and punishing it's like
6376000	6378000	that's no problem so the way
6378000	6380000	you motivate yourself partly is by thinking
6380000	6382000	well do you really want more suffering and misery
6382000	6384000	in the world or do you want less
6384000	6386000	you know and that's basically the decision
6386000	6388000	that we made at the Nuremberg trials right
6388000	6390000	way back at the end of World War II
6390000	6392000	is it wrong to inflict pointless
6392000	6394000	pain and suffering on people for aesthetic
6394000	6396000	purposes
6396000	6398000	and the answer was well
6398000	6400000	yeah okay good we got hell specified
6400000	6402000	that's good
6402000	6404000	so you think well the opposite of that
6404000	6406000	whatever is the opposite of that well we don't know
6406000	6408000	that's what you're pursuing unless you were
6408000	6410000	like pretty fond of what happened with the Nazis
6410000	6412000	you know so
6412000	6414000	you motivate yourself by
6414000	6416000	running away from the most awful thing
6416000	6418000	there is towards the thing that's the best
6418000	6420000	that could possibly be
6420000	6422000	and it's up to you to decide what those things
6422000	6424000	are I mean you're an independent
6424000	6426000	being with all sorts of ability it's like
6426000	6428000	solve the problems you can solve
6428000	6430000	like more power to you
6430000	6432000	I've got my problems I'm going to solve
6432000	6434000	them and hopefully jointly
6434000	6436000	all of us we can make this
6436000	6438000	place that's fragmented and flawed
6438000	6440000	and decrepit and trouble and beauty
6440000	6442000	and all of that into a place that's
6442000	6444000	as good as we can imagine
6444000	6446000	anyways and we should adopt
6446000	6448000	the responsibility to do that because the alternative
6450000	6452000	you think that
6452000	6454000	responsibility is miserable
6454000	6456000	is you try your responsibility
6456000	6458000	just see what happens
6458000	6460000	so that's
6460000	6462000	that's my answer to that problem
6462000	6464000	can I have the question I'd get please
6464000	6466000	because I don't I think I have a
6466000	6468000	I'm not going to challenge what Jordan says
6468000	6470000	but I think I want to answer a different aspect
6470000	6472000	of Dan's question
6472000	6474000	how can people overcome the resistance to the
6474000	6476000	crushing responsibility that comes with confronting
6476000	6478000	the means
6478000	6480000	so I think you can make a moral argument like Jordan has
6480000	6482000	and I think that's valuable but
6482000	6484000	part of what he was
6484000	6486000	part of what's being implied there
6486000	6488000	is that
6488000	6490000	the question is more about
6490000	6492000	how to enable people
6492000	6494000	and what I would answer
6494000	6496000	I hope that's a fair thing to say
6496000	6498000	Dan's nodding so that's a good sign
6498000	6500000	I
6500000	6502000	would say there that and this is again
6502000	6504000	to fall back on to Socrates and Plato
6504000	6506000	and give me
6506000	6508000	a moment here because I'm going to say something that might be
6508000	6510000	a little bit at first
6510000	6512000	Plato talked about the fact that people
6512000	6514000	have to be seduced into transcendence
6514000	6516000	and
6516000	6518000	that word kind of strikes us off because we don't like
6518000	6520000	the notion of seduction but what he meant by that
6520000	6522000	is you it's like you can't it's like
6522000	6524000	you have to sometimes tell your kids just do
6524000	6526000	this and then once you've done
6526000	6528000	it you will know why it was
6528000	6530000	important to do it you have to go through
6530000	6532000	the transformation in order to understand
6532000	6534000	why the transformation is valuable to you
6534000	6536000	now typically people just
6536000	6538000	know right and so what you want to do
6538000	6540000	is you want you want to
6540000	6542000	give some form of behavior to people
6542000	6544000	from where
6544000	6546000	that's inside the box they're in
6546000	6548000	that they like to do inside the box
6548000	6550000	but has this little time bomb
6550000	6552000	in it and Jesus of Nazareth was
6552000	6554000	a master at these kinds of time bombs
6554000	6556000	and they were called parables you tell this story like
6556000	6558000	oh I know what this story is
6558000	6560000	but it has this little explosive thing in the center
6560000	6562000	of it that's a snake
6562000	6564000	okay well whatever
6564000	6566000	and the point I'm trying to make is
6566000	6568000	you give people
6568000	6570000	certain psychotechnologies certain techniques
6570000	6572000	and you say you know this will
6572000	6574000	help do this this will help
6574000	6576000	you do this this will help you know solve
6576000	6578000	you know some of your own more practical problems
6578000	6580000	this will make you more insightful
6580000	6582000	this will make you a little bit more cognitively flexible
6582000	6584000	but then what you've also
6584000	6586000	what you've actually done is you've also
6586000	6588000	prepared them
6588000	6590000	in two ways you've
6590000	6592000	prepared them to actually extend that
6592000	6594000	machinery because it has a momentum in it
6594000	6596000	and start to ask the question for themselves
6596000	6598000	and you've also enabled them
6598000	6600000	to act to respond to the question
6600000	6602000	in a more challenging form
6602000	6604000	and then if you can keep doing that
6604000	6606000	with them in a kind of Socratic dance
6606000	6608000	you can you can draw
6608000	6610000	and this is what was meant by the seduction metaphor
6610000	6612000	you can draw people into
6612000	6614000	a very deep kind of responsibility
6614000	6616000	without having them at any point
6616000	6618000	confront a kind of crushing
6618000	6620000	clash and I mean in that sense
6620000	6622000	and I don't mean this in a patronizing sense
6622000	6624000	it is very much like good parenting
6624000	6626000	right yourself
6626000	6628000	yes of yourself whoever you're trying to help
6628000	6630000	confront
6630000	6632000	the meaning crisis
6632000	6634000	without as Dan is saying
6634000	6636000	sort of just dropping this nightmare on them
6636000	6638000	so that's how I would try
6638000	6640000	I want to elaborate on that a little bit
6640000	6642000	because you know John brought up
6642000	6644000	this other idea about parables
6644000	6646000	and so I want to tell you about a meta parable
6646000	6648000	because the parables that Christ
6648000	6650000	laid out were embedded
6650000	6652000	in a meta parable
6652000	6654000	and the meta parable
6656000	6658000	what expanded itself
6658000	6660000	over 2000 years into Christianity
6660000	6662000	essentially and so although it has its roots
6662000	6664000	far before Christianity emerged
6664000	6666000	so John said
6666000	6668000	you know you throw someone a little box
6668000	6670000	and you say transform within it
6670000	6672000	it's like okay fine so I would say the way you do that
6672000	6674000	is like we said this earlier
6674000	6676000	pick a problem that bugs you
6676000	6678000	that's why Jiminy Cricket is an insect by the way
6678000	6680000	pick a problem that bugs you
6680000	6682000	that you could solve
6682000	6684000	and solve it
6684000	6686000	now what Piaget would say
6686000	6688000	that in order to do that
6688000	6690000	you're going to have to take some of the presuppositions
6690000	6692000	that you're using locally in that box
6692000	6694000	let them die
6694000	6696000	that's a kind of sacrifice
6696000	6698000	and then
6698000	6700000	generate a little local chaos
6700000	6702000	and then pop up a new solution
6702000	6704000	and so that's a small death and rebirth
6704000	6706000	and so the reason that the parables
6706000	6708000	are tested inside the story of death and rebirth
6708000	6710000	is because the idea
6710000	6712000	is that the way that you get to the kingdom of heaven
6712000	6714000	so to speak
6714000	6716000	is to allow yourself to die
6716000	6718000	and be reborn and so you should have faith
6718000	6720000	in the part of yourself that can undergo
6720000	6722000	a disilutive process
6722000	6724000	in preparation
6724000	6726000	for a rebirth and that can happen
6726000	6728000	at multiple levels of analysis
6728000	6730000	micro levels which is where you should start
6730000	6732000	man start at the micro levels
6732000	6734000	fix what's at hand
6734000	6736000	and then if you get good at that
6736000	6738000	you can start moving up the abstraction chain
6738000	6740000	and you know if you get all the way to the top
6740000	6742000	which you won't because you can't
6742000	6744000	then the deaths and rebirths are very very
6744000	6746000	profound and significant
6746000	6748000	well that's a metaphor in many ways
6748000	6750000	and I don't know how far it extends
6750000	6752000	I mean it extends in long ways
6752000	6754000	but that is part of what
6754000	6756000	that drama and it is a drama
6756000	6758000	is trying to teach us about ourselves
6758000	6760000	we formulated the drama
6760000	6762000	to tell us who we are
6762000	6764000	you know and so
6764000	6766000	I like that
6766000	6768000	I really like that
6768000	6770000	you just said about the meta parable
6770000	6772000	and Christ exemplifying a parable
6772000	6774000	as a background thing
6774000	6776000	to ground his spoken parables
6776000	6778000	that's quite brilliant well done
6778000	6780000	thank you it only took me like 35 years
6780000	6782000	to think of it
6782000	6784000	well better you than me because I benefit from that
6784000	6786000	I mean that's great
6786000	6788000	I mean that's really good that's very good
6788000	6790000	I think
6790000	6792000	and I think
6792000	6794000	you're noticing about disillusion
6794000	6796000	affording you know this is
6796000	6798000	you know this is dynamical systems theory
6798000	6800000	it's also what the shaman do
6800000	6802000	yes of course
6802000	6804000	and I was also saying
6804000	6806000	that I think it's prevalent also
6806000	6808000	in the platonic metaphor
6808000	6810000	of people who are attracted
6810000	6812000	in the cave and they've been trapped
6812000	6814000	so that they're always looking at the shadows
6814000	6816000	and hearing the echoes and they have to make their way out
6816000	6818000	and they make their way a little bit
6818000	6820000	they make their eyes accommodate
6820000	6822000	and then that allows them to go a little bit farther
6822000	6824000	and then that blinds them
6824000	6826000	and then their eyes accommodate
6826000	6828000	and then that affords them to go a little bit farther
6828000	6830000	and you do the ascension
6830000	6832000	you do the anagogy out towards
6832000	6834000	where you're in the real world
6834000	6836000	looking at the sun
6836000	6838000	and I think that's the way you do it with people
6838000	6840000	well and then once you've looked at the sun
6840000	6842000	you take the light home and you distribute it
6842000	6844000	to people who are in the dark
6844000	6846000	well the problem as Plato said is when you go back down
6846000	6848000	day two if you go back
6848000	6850000	I mean Plato said it first way before man for man
6850000	6852000	you're blinded by the light
6852000	6854000	but if you go back too soon
6854000	6856000	they're going to kill you
6856000	6858000	like they kill Socrates
6858000	6860000	so then there's just as much
6860000	6862000	problem
6862000	6864000	of responsibility
6864000	6866000	on the teacher
6866000	6868000	as there is on the people being taught
6868000	6870000	they can suffer also a kind of catastrophic
6870000	6872000	event
6872000	6874000	if they come back down from the sun
6874000	6876000	I'm not putting myself in that place of enlightenment
6876000	6878000	but you know what I'm trying to say
6880000	6882000	I'm pretty much done
6882000	6884000	that's our time
6884000	6886000	good work
6886000	6888000	congratulations
