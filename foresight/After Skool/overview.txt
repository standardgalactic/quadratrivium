Checking After Skool/DIVIDE & RULE - The Plan of The 1% to Make You DISPOSABLE - Vandana Shiva.txt
在这段文字中，作者首先提到了移民（migrant）的概念，并引用了VHP（Vishwa Hindu Parishad），这是一个印度的宗教和社会团体，以及“God playing hide and seek”这句诗。接着，作者强调了在当前全球经济政策中的“分而治之”（divide and rule）策略，这种策略是为了维持1%少数阶级的统治所必需的。作者提到了南非早期的种族法律和 apartheid系统的起源，以及马丁路德·金（Martin Luther King Jr.）被迫处理经济正义和经济平等问题时遭遇的致命伤害。

作者指出，经济的本质是多重暴力，因为它不仅涉及对地球的暴力，还涉及对他人生活方式的破坏。随着技术的发展，尤其是人工智能在许多领域（如医学成像、法律等）中取代人类劳动，99%人口可能会被视为可抛弃的。作者呼吁我们要共同推动“地球民主”（earth democracy），即一种强调全人类和单一地球统一的政治项目，以防止这种可抛弃现象的发展。

最后，作者呼吁记得我们是一个人类，是在一个地球上存在的，我们要保持对彼此和地球的联结，并共同应对挑战，以确保尊重和可持续性。作者强调了“C'est la vie, c'est la vie”这句话，意味着他们不带来和平，只带来战争，分化然后征服的现代形式，即在名义上称之为民主的同时实施控制和压迫。

Checking After Skool/Exposing Scientific Dogmas - Banned TED Talk - Rupert Sheldrake.txt
1. The value of the gravitational constant (G) has traditionally been determined by various laboratories around the world, which then average their results to come up with a standard value. However, there is evidence that G may not be completely constant but could fluctuate throughout the day and year due to environmental factors like dark matter patches in the galaxy.

2. The speaker has been advocating for metrologists to analyze the raw data from these labs to check for fluctuations over time. This data should ideally be made publicly available online, with dates and measurements, to determine if G and other fundamental physical constants are indeed changing together.

3. The speaker argues that such a shift in thinking could lead to new scientific discoveries and a reinvigoration of science as a field by breaking down dogmatic assumptions that currently inhibit inquiry.

4. Another area where the speaker believes dogma is hindering progress is in the study of consciousness, particularly the nature of perception and the extension of the mind beyond the brain. The speaker suggests that our minds interact with the external world more directly than current scientific theories allow, with evidence including the sense of being stared at and the ability of distant stars to be perceived as part of one's mental landscape.

5. The speaker emphasizes the importance of science in understanding the universe and our place within it but urges the scientific community to question established dogmas to foster a new era of scientific discovery that is both interesting and life-affirming.
