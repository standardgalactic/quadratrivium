00:00.000 --> 00:13.040
The way you design the world in your mind

00:13.040 --> 00:16.080
is the way you relate to it in the real world.

00:16.080 --> 00:20.880
And when you design it as dead matter just to be exploited,

00:20.880 --> 00:23.160
you will exploit it.

00:23.160 --> 00:27.240
When you design it without any understanding of limits,

00:27.240 --> 00:30.920
you will violate the planetary limits.

00:30.920 --> 00:33.240
When you design it with deep recognition

00:33.240 --> 00:38.520
of interconnectedness, you will nurture those relationships.

00:38.520 --> 00:42.880
And this basic recognition is what

00:42.880 --> 00:48.920
I drew from my learnings in quantum theory,

00:48.920 --> 00:53.280
that non-locality, non-separation, interconnectedness,

00:53.280 --> 00:56.600
that is the nature of reality.

00:56.600 --> 01:00.720
But we have a design in the paradigm

01:00.720 --> 01:07.200
of mechanistic thought which didn't evolve.

01:07.200 --> 01:09.360
It was imposed.

01:09.360 --> 01:11.600
That mechanistic thought is based first

01:11.600 --> 01:16.360
on the assumption that we are separate from nature.

01:16.360 --> 01:19.960
And nature is constituted of discrete particles

01:19.960 --> 01:24.000
separate from each other who can only relate through violence,

01:24.000 --> 01:27.800
through force, through action by contact.

01:27.800 --> 01:30.440
In the quantum world, there is no separability.

01:30.440 --> 01:34.200
My thesis was on non-locality in quantum theory.

01:34.200 --> 01:37.440
Everything is interconnected.

01:37.440 --> 01:41.280
There are no fixed, essentialized qualities

01:41.280 --> 01:45.040
that have been built into the way.

01:45.040 --> 01:46.640
People are looked at.

01:46.640 --> 01:48.720
Nature is looked at.

01:48.720 --> 01:54.440
Potential is the defining quality in the quantum world.

01:54.440 --> 01:56.880
And because it's about potential,

01:56.880 --> 01:59.960
it's also about uncertainty.

01:59.960 --> 02:04.520
The mechanical world is based on a false illusion

02:04.520 --> 02:07.880
of determinateness, certainty.

02:07.880 --> 02:12.000
And in the quantum world, we know

02:12.000 --> 02:15.280
we cannot get rid of uncertainty, the uncertainty

02:15.280 --> 02:18.960
principle of Eisenberg.

02:18.960 --> 02:22.160
To this is linked to the fourth principle,

02:22.160 --> 02:27.920
no excluded middle, no duality, no either or.

02:27.920 --> 02:32.480
In the quantum world, it's and.

02:32.480 --> 02:35.240
In the mechanistic world, you can either

02:35.240 --> 02:38.160
be a wave or a particle.

02:38.160 --> 02:39.760
In the quantum world, you have potential

02:39.760 --> 02:42.400
to be both and they're complementary.

02:42.400 --> 02:47.720
When you realize that the world is one interconnected whole,

02:47.720 --> 02:54.680
you also realize that what appears different

02:54.680 --> 02:57.200
is actually different expressions

02:57.200 --> 02:58.520
of an interconnected reality.

03:03.120 --> 03:06.240
For the first time in human history,

03:06.240 --> 03:09.160
technology in the hands of the billionaires

03:09.160 --> 03:12.920
becomes the new civilizing mission for humanity.

03:12.920 --> 03:18.680
The illusions about the big technology firms

03:18.680 --> 03:26.560
is they create, they extract, they don't create anything.

03:26.560 --> 03:34.640
Software programmers create the platforms that they use.

03:34.640 --> 03:37.720
Even Bill Gates didn't really write his basic program,

03:37.720 --> 03:42.080
it was two math professors in Dartmouth College

03:42.080 --> 03:45.160
who did the basic program.

03:45.160 --> 03:48.880
They have posited themselves as inventors.

03:48.880 --> 03:53.320
When basically we've done a new report,

03:53.320 --> 03:56.920
because Bill Gates announced a new project called Ag 1.

03:56.920 --> 03:59.520
All agriculture will be one agriculture control by him.

03:59.520 --> 04:02.280
Where does he set up the office of Ag 1?

04:02.280 --> 04:06.160
In Missouri, Women's Center's headquarters.

04:06.160 --> 04:08.320
But we watch what's going on in India

04:08.320 --> 04:09.800
and we piece it together.

04:09.800 --> 04:13.720
So basically he's financing a lot of data mining

04:13.720 --> 04:17.480
from farmers, which will then be packaged back

04:17.480 --> 04:19.800
as big data and sold back to the farmers.

04:19.800 --> 04:23.880
But this is exactly what happened in your 2016 elections.

04:23.880 --> 04:29.000
Facebook sold data to Cambridge Analytica.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.320
So when you think of why are the kind of leaders

04:32.320 --> 04:34.480
that we have getting created, it's

04:34.480 --> 04:37.840
very important to remember that in these 25 years

04:37.840 --> 04:41.000
of corporate deregulation of commerce,

04:41.000 --> 04:44.480
you basically have a lot of money

04:44.480 --> 04:47.040
in the hands of very few people.

04:47.040 --> 04:50.960
And they then are the ones investing in all the companies.

04:50.960 --> 04:53.240
The companies are not independent companies anymore.

04:53.240 --> 04:55.760
They're basically billionaire money managed

04:55.760 --> 05:01.920
by the investment funds like BlackRock and Vanguard, et cetera.

05:01.920 --> 05:06.360
They also know that everywhere people are on the streets.

05:06.360 --> 05:08.880
Just look at this here.

05:08.880 --> 05:12.920
Show me a country where there weren't protests.

05:12.920 --> 05:19.400
Chile, Beirut, Hong Kong, everywhere.

05:19.400 --> 05:28.200
So how do you deal with the rising demand for a change?

05:28.200 --> 05:32.640
We threw out the East India Company in 1857.

05:32.640 --> 05:34.880
The crown took over.

05:34.880 --> 05:40.040
They established a policy called divide and rule.

05:40.040 --> 05:44.400
And then they started to divide Hindus and Muslims

05:44.400 --> 05:46.600
because Hindus and Muslims had stood together

05:46.600 --> 05:50.400
to defend their land, their livelihoods, their freedom.

05:50.400 --> 05:58.400
It took from 1857 to about 1920 for all kinds of means,

05:58.400 --> 06:04.200
censors, fake identity, because people in India

06:04.200 --> 06:05.600
would say, I'm a Hindu and a Muslim.

06:05.600 --> 06:08.800
Because they'd go to mosques and they'd go to temples.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.880
And when they'd be asked, who are you,

06:10.880 --> 06:12.640
they'd say, I'm a gardener.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.240
I'm a blacksmith.

06:14.240 --> 06:18.800
For them, the religious part was very, very secondary.

06:18.800 --> 06:21.320
Their occupation was their main identity, the place

06:21.320 --> 06:23.720
where they came from, the community they came from.

06:23.720 --> 06:30.280
And this took so long, this is what led to our partition.

06:30.280 --> 06:32.160
And that partition is still being played out.

06:32.160 --> 06:34.640
It's an incomplete project.

06:34.640 --> 06:40.960
So divide and rule becomes a necessity for the 1%

06:40.960 --> 06:43.760
to continue to hold on to power.

06:43.760 --> 06:47.640
What are the economic policies being pushed

06:47.640 --> 06:51.800
while people are divided?

06:51.800 --> 06:53.040
Because that's really the agenda.

06:56.800 --> 07:01.440
In 1906, when this divide and rule and apartheid

07:01.440 --> 07:03.240
was being put in place, apartheid hadn't

07:03.240 --> 07:05.200
been named apartheid then.

07:05.200 --> 07:08.240
It was only named as a system in 1948.

07:08.240 --> 07:14.240
But in 1906, the British wanted to turn Indians

07:14.240 --> 07:16.720
in South Africa into second-class citizens.

07:16.720 --> 07:19.080
So they wrote an Indian Act.

07:19.080 --> 07:24.160
And Indians had to carry, had to register on race.

07:24.160 --> 07:26.600
And they had to carry their identities all the time.

07:26.600 --> 07:28.640
And a lot of what's happening right now in India

07:28.640 --> 07:30.960
around this identity issue is related

07:30.960 --> 07:33.720
to that history of the Satyagre.

07:33.720 --> 07:36.520
But most importantly, any police officer

07:36.520 --> 07:41.360
could enter your house at any time and demand your papers.

07:41.360 --> 07:43.080
You couldn't trade locally.

07:43.080 --> 07:45.200
You couldn't practice professions.

07:45.200 --> 07:52.120
And so the people said, we would rather die.

07:52.120 --> 07:56.880
This refusal to cooperate with unjust law

07:56.880 --> 08:00.800
is what Gandhi calls Satyagre, as a duty, as a duty of truth.

08:00.800 --> 08:04.080
He was inspired by Thoreau, who refused

08:04.080 --> 08:08.360
to pay the poll tax here against the slave system.

08:08.360 --> 08:11.880
He inspired Martin Luther King.

08:11.880 --> 08:16.520
And the civil rights movement is very much inspired by Gandhi.

08:16.520 --> 08:19.160
But it is when King started to take up

08:19.160 --> 08:22.360
the economic justice and economic equality issues,

08:22.360 --> 08:24.160
that's when he was assassinated.

08:24.160 --> 08:28.320
Because the part is you can talk in very sweet ways

08:28.320 --> 08:33.240
about civil liberties, but you don't touch economic justice.

08:33.240 --> 08:37.760
And the economy is, for me, it's a double violence

08:37.760 --> 08:41.840
because the origin of the word, the meaning of the word economy,

08:41.840 --> 08:45.040
comes from Oikosa home.

08:45.040 --> 08:52.000
The Aristotelian name is Oikonomia, the art of living.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.760
And when you turn the art of living

08:53.760 --> 08:56.200
into the art of money making, which Aristotle

08:56.200 --> 08:59.720
called chromatistics, then you have

08:59.720 --> 09:01.640
to practice violence against the earth

09:01.640 --> 09:05.680
and violence against others, destroy their livelihoods,

09:05.680 --> 09:08.720
destroy their freedoms, take away their resources.

09:08.720 --> 09:10.400
So the violence is multiple.

09:10.400 --> 09:13.000
And I look into the future.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.400
I say, why are we building detention centers everywhere

09:16.400 --> 09:19.520
in India along the border of Mexico?

09:19.520 --> 09:24.320
Because I feel that if we don't activate

09:24.320 --> 09:29.960
our sense of interconnectedness with all life, with all people,

09:29.960 --> 09:32.200
if we don't start sowing the seeds of what

09:32.200 --> 09:34.920
I have called earth democracy, we

09:34.920 --> 09:39.600
are going to see 99% people as disposable,

09:39.600 --> 09:44.440
especially with the tech working on artificial intelligence,

09:44.440 --> 09:48.480
to make sure all the mechanical work is made redundant.

09:48.480 --> 09:52.280
Whether it be in radiography or law or whatever,

09:52.280 --> 09:56.480
mechanical work will be substituted.

09:56.480 --> 10:01.480
And if that's the case, 99% people are disposable.

10:01.480 --> 10:04.440
So you can either share this beautiful planet

10:04.440 --> 10:07.680
with love and abundance and sustainability,

10:07.680 --> 10:12.600
or say it's all mine, every bit of land, every seed,

10:12.600 --> 10:17.760
every mind, because what's being mined is our mind now.

10:17.760 --> 10:21.960
And if we don't defend the freedoms of all species

10:21.960 --> 10:23.800
and the freedoms of all human beings,

10:23.800 --> 10:27.280
we could see within 20, 30 years,

10:27.280 --> 10:31.600
a level of disposability built into the structures

10:31.600 --> 10:34.240
that humanity will not be able to respond to.

10:34.240 --> 10:38.640
So this is the time to make oneness and interconnectedness

10:38.640 --> 10:41.800
as one humanity on one planet, the political project

10:41.800 --> 10:42.480
of our times.

10:46.440 --> 10:49.960
We have to remember we are one humanity.

10:49.960 --> 10:52.240
We are part of one earth.

10:52.240 --> 10:55.640
And whatever we do, we will not let

10:55.640 --> 11:03.200
this basic recognition divide us, either from the earth

11:03.200 --> 11:04.920
or from each other.

11:04.920 --> 11:06.080
And together, we are strong.

11:06.620 --> 11:07.240
Thank you.

11:08.600 --> 11:09.560
Thank you.

11:09.560 --> 11:10.620
Thank you.

11:10.620 --> 11:12.500
Thank you very much.

11:12.500 --> 11:14.220
Thank you.

11:14.220 --> 11:14.980
Thank you.

11:15.380 --> 11:15.500
移民.

11:15.500 --> 11:16.380
Thank you.

11:16.380 --> 11:16.600
And take care.

11:16.600 --> 11:22.600
Thank you very much.

11:30.260 --> 11:33.680
Isn't there a VHP for those of you

11:33.680 --> 11:49.680
Quick reminder, God playing hide and seek, my mission is to find, step by step, as I walk through the valley in the shadow of death, I feel no threat, the earth is the block I rep, no fear when I step, God steady clearing the debt, I earn the respect.

11:49.680 --> 12:01.680
C'est la vie, c'est la vie, they only bring war, but they try to call it peace, divide, then conquer the mark of the beast, oppression and control in the name of democracy.
