00:00.000 --> 00:25.960
The

00:25.960 --> 00:29.560
science delusion is the belief that science already understands the nature

00:29.560 --> 00:34.160
of reality in principle, leaving any of the details to be filled in.

00:34.160 --> 00:37.440
This is a very widespread belief in our society.

00:37.440 --> 00:39.920
It's the kind of belief system of people who say,

00:39.920 --> 00:42.720
I don't believe in God, I believe in science.

00:42.720 --> 00:48.880
It's a belief system which has now been spread to the entire world.

00:48.880 --> 00:51.800
But there's a conflict in the heart of science between science

00:51.800 --> 00:56.520
as a method of inquiry based on reason, evidence, hypothesis,

00:56.560 --> 01:02.240
and collective investigation, and science as a belief system or a world view.

01:02.240 --> 01:06.720
And unfortunately, the world view aspect of science has come to inhibit and

01:06.720 --> 01:11.040
constrict the free inquiry, which is the very lifeblood of the scientific endeavor.

01:12.960 --> 01:18.800
Since the late 19th century, science has been conducted under the aspect of a belief

01:18.800 --> 01:22.800
system or world view, which is essentially that of materialism,

01:22.800 --> 01:25.120
philosophical materialism.

01:25.120 --> 01:29.760
And these sciences are now wholly owned subsidiaries of the materialist world view.

01:31.800 --> 01:36.080
I think that as we break out of it, the sciences will be regenerated.

01:37.640 --> 01:39.600
What I do in my book, The Science Delusion,

01:39.600 --> 01:42.520
which is called Science Set Free in the United States,

01:43.920 --> 01:50.520
is take the ten dogmas or assumptions of science and turn them into questions.

01:50.520 --> 01:54.680
Seeing how well they stand up if you look at them scientifically.

01:56.120 --> 01:57.680
None of them stand up very well.

01:58.920 --> 02:02.880
What I'm going to do is first run through what these ten dogmas are,

02:02.880 --> 02:07.560
and then I'll only have time to discuss one or two of them in a bit more detail.

02:07.560 --> 02:12.320
But essentially the ten dogmas, which are the default world view of most educated

02:12.320 --> 02:17.600
people all over the world, are first the nature's mechanical or machine-like.

02:17.600 --> 02:19.480
The universe is like a machine.

02:19.480 --> 02:21.520
Animals and plants are like machines.

02:21.520 --> 02:22.680
We're like machines.

02:22.840 --> 02:24.360
In fact, we are machines.

02:24.360 --> 02:28.440
We're lumbering robots in Richard Dawkins' vivid phrase,

02:28.440 --> 02:31.320
with brains that are genetically programmed computers.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.760
Second, matter is unconscious.

02:34.760 --> 02:37.320
The whole universe is made up of unconscious matter.

02:38.720 --> 02:44.160
There's no consciousness in stars, in galaxies, in planets, in animals, in plants.

02:44.160 --> 02:47.800
And there ought not to be any in us either, if this theory is true.

02:47.800 --> 02:51.920
So a lot of the philosophy of mind over the last hundred years is being trying

02:51.920 --> 02:53.880
to prove that we're not really conscious at all.

02:55.720 --> 03:01.000
So the matter's unconscious, then the laws of nature are fixed.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.560
This is dogma three.

03:02.560 --> 03:06.320
The laws of nature are the same now as they were at the time of the Big Bang,

03:06.320 --> 03:08.120
and they'll be the same forever.

03:08.120 --> 03:10.560
Not just the laws, but the constants of nature are fixed,

03:10.560 --> 03:12.120
which is why they're called constants.

03:13.960 --> 03:17.480
Dogma four, the total amount of matter and energy is always the same.

03:18.480 --> 03:22.400
It never changes in total quantity, except at the moment of the Big Bang,

03:22.400 --> 03:25.560
when it all sprang into existence from nowhere in a single instant.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.800
The fifth dogma is that nature's purposeless.

03:29.800 --> 03:36.600
There are no purposers in all nature, and the evolutionary process has no purpose or direction.

03:37.800 --> 03:43.400
Dogma six, the biological heredity is material.

03:44.000 --> 03:49.080
Everything you inherit is in your genes or in epigenetic modifications of the genes

03:49.080 --> 03:51.440
or in cytoplasmic inheritance.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.360
It's material.

03:53.360 --> 03:58.360
Dogma seven, memories are stored inside your brain as material traces.

03:58.360 --> 04:02.080
Somehow everything you remember is in your brain in modified nerve endings,

04:02.080 --> 04:03.600
phosphorylated proteins.

04:03.600 --> 04:06.360
No one knows how it works, but nevertheless,

04:06.360 --> 04:09.520
almost everyone in the scientific world believes it must be in the brain.

04:10.520 --> 04:13.800
Dogma eight, your mind is inside your head.

04:13.800 --> 04:18.600
All your consciousness is the activity of your brain and nothing more.

04:18.600 --> 04:21.080
Dogma nine, which follows from dogma eight,

04:21.080 --> 04:24.240
psychic phenomena like telepathy are impossible.

04:24.240 --> 04:27.520
Your thoughts and intentions cannot have any effect at a distance

04:27.520 --> 04:29.760
because your mind is inside your head.

04:29.760 --> 04:35.080
Therefore, all the apparent evidence for telepathy and other psychic phenomena is illusory.

04:35.960 --> 04:37.480
People believe these things happen,

04:37.640 --> 04:40.440
but it's just because they don't know enough about statistics

04:40.440 --> 04:44.760
or they're deceived by coincidences or it's wishful thinking.

04:45.760 --> 04:50.080
And dogma ten, mechanistic medicine is the only kind that really works.

04:50.080 --> 04:54.520
That's why governments only fund research into mechanistic medicine

04:54.520 --> 04:57.840
and ignore complementary and alternative therapies.

04:57.840 --> 05:01.320
Those can't possibly really work because they're not mechanistic.

05:01.320 --> 05:04.760
They may appear to work because people would have got better anyway

05:04.760 --> 05:06.960
or because of the placebo effect.

05:07.680 --> 05:11.040
But the only kind that really works is mechanistic medicine.

05:12.120 --> 05:13.920
Well, this is the default world view,

05:13.920 --> 05:17.760
which is held by almost all educated people all over the world.

05:17.760 --> 05:22.360
It's the basis of the educational system, the National Health Service,

05:22.360 --> 05:26.120
the Medical Research Council, governments,

05:26.120 --> 05:30.160
and it's just the default world view of educated people.

05:31.400 --> 05:35.720
But I think every one of these dogmas is very, very questionable.

05:35.760 --> 05:39.440
And when you look at it, they fall apart.

05:40.760 --> 05:44.840
I'm going to take first the idea that the laws of nature are fixed.

05:44.840 --> 05:47.000
This is a hangover from an older world view

05:47.000 --> 05:50.480
before the 1960s when the Big Bang Theory came in.

05:50.480 --> 05:53.640
People thought that the whole universe was eternal,

05:53.640 --> 05:55.760
governed by eternal mathematical laws.

05:56.920 --> 06:00.320
When the Big Bang came in, then that assumption continued,

06:00.320 --> 06:04.840
even though the Big Bang revealed a universe that's radically evolutionary,

06:04.840 --> 06:06.840
about 14 billion years old,

06:06.840 --> 06:11.120
growing and developing and evolving for 14 billion years,

06:11.120 --> 06:15.120
growing and cooling and more structures and patterns appear within it.

06:15.120 --> 06:18.360
But the idea is all the laws of nature were completely fixed

06:18.360 --> 06:21.360
at the moment of the Big Bang, like a cosmic Napoleonic code.

06:22.440 --> 06:24.840
As my friend Terence McKenna used to say,

06:24.840 --> 06:26.800
modern science is based on the principle,

06:26.800 --> 06:29.960
give us one free miracle and we'll explain the rest.

06:29.960 --> 06:32.840
And the one free miracle is the appearance of all the matter and energy

06:32.840 --> 06:34.840
in the universe and all the laws that govern it

06:34.840 --> 06:36.840
from nothing in a single instant.

06:38.840 --> 06:41.320
Well, in an evolutionary universe,

06:41.320 --> 06:43.320
why shouldn't the laws themselves evolve?

06:44.280 --> 06:45.720
After all, human laws do,

06:45.720 --> 06:49.800
and the idea of laws of nature is based on a metaphor with human laws.

06:49.800 --> 06:51.880
It's a very anthropocentric metaphor.

06:51.880 --> 06:55.520
Only humans have laws, in fact, only civilized societies have laws.

06:56.520 --> 06:58.080
As C.S. Lewis once said,

06:58.080 --> 07:01.000
to say that a stone falls to earth because it's obeying a law

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
and makes it a man and even a citizen.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
It's a metaphor that we got so used to, we forget it's a metaphor.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
In an evolving universe, I think a much better idea is the idea of habits.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
I think the habits of nature evolve,

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
the regularities of nature are essentially habitual.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
This was an idea put forward at the beginning of the 20th century

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
by the American philosopher C.S. Perse.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
And it's an idea which various other philosophers have entertained,

07:28.000 --> 07:33.000
and it's one which I myself have developed into a scientific hypothesis,

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
the hypothesis of morphic resonance,

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
which is the basis of these evolving habits.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
According to this hypothesis,

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
everything in nature has a kind of collective memory.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
Resonance occurs on the basis of similarity.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
As a young giraffe, embryo grows in its mother's womb.

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
It tunes in to the morphic resonance of previous giraffes.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
It draws on that collective memory.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
It grows like a giraffe and it behaves like a giraffe

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
because it's drawing on this collective memory.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
It has to have the right genes to make the right proteins,

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
but genes in my view are grossly overrated.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
They only account for the proteins that the organism can make,

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
not the shape or the form or the behavior.

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
Every species has a kind of collective memory, even crystals do.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
This theory predicts that if you make a new kind of crystal for the first time,

08:23.000 --> 08:28.000
the very first time you make it, it won't have an existing habit.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
But once it crystallizes, then the next time you make it,

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
there'll be an influence from the first crystals to the second ones all over the world.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
By morphic resonance, it'll crystallize a bit easier.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
The third time, there'll be an influence from the first and second crystals.

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
There is in fact good evidence that new compounds get easier to crystallize all around the world,

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
just as this theory would predict.

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
It also predicts that if you train animals to learn a new trick,

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
for example, rats learn a new trick in London,

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
then all around the world rats of the same breed should learn the same trick quicker

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
just because the rats have landed here.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
And surprisingly, there's already evidence that this actually happens.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
Anyway, that's my own hypothesis in a nutshell of morphic resonance.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
Everything depends on evolving habits, not on fixed laws.

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
But I want to spend a few moments on the constants of nature, too,

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
because these, again, are assumed to be constant.

09:22.000 --> 09:27.000
Things like the gravitational constant, the speed of light, are called the fundamental constants.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
Are they really constant?

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
Well, when I got interested in this question, I tried to find out.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
They're given in physics handbooks.

09:36.000 --> 09:41.000
Handbooks of physics list the existing fundamental constants and tell you their value.

09:41.000 --> 09:46.000
But I wanted to see if they'd change, so I got the old volumes of physical handbooks.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
I went to the Patent Office Library here in London,

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
and they're the only place I could find that kept the old volumes.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
Normally, people throw them away when the new values come out.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
They throw away the old ones.

09:57.000 --> 10:02.000
When I did this, I found that the speed of light dropped between 1928 and 1945

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
by about 20 kilometers per second.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
It's a huge drop because they're given with errors of any fractions,

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
decimals points of error.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
And yet, all over the world, it dropped,

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
and they were all getting values very similar to each other with tiny errors.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
Then in 1945, it went up at 48. It went up again.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
And then people started getting very similar values again.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
I was very intrigued by this, and I couldn't make sense of it,

10:29.000 --> 10:34.000
so I went to see the head of metrology at the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington.

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
Metrology is the science in which people measure constants.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
And I asked him about this.

10:40.000 --> 10:45.000
I said, what do you make of this drop in the speed of light between 1928 and 1945?

10:45.000 --> 10:51.000
And he said, oh dear, you've uncovered the most embarrassing episode in the history of our science.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
So I said, well, could the speed of light have actually dropped?

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
And that would have amazing implications if so.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
He said, no, no, of course it couldn't have actually dropped. It's a constant.

11:02.000 --> 11:08.000
So, oh, well then, how do you explain the fact everyone was finding it going much slower during that period?

11:08.000 --> 11:13.000
Is it because they were fudging their results to get what they thought other people should be getting,

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
and the whole thing was just produced by, in the minds of physicists?

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
He said, we don't like to use the word fudge.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
I said, well, what do you prefer?

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
He said, well, we prefer to call it intellectual phase locking.

11:26.000 --> 11:36.000
So I said, well, if it was going on then, how can we be so sure it's not going on today?

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
And that the present values are produced by intellectual phase locking.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
And he said, oh, we know that's not the case.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
I said, how do we know?

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
He said, well, we've solved the problem.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
And I said, well, how?

11:47.000 --> 11:52.000
He said, well, we fixed the speed of light by definition in 1972.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
So I said, but it might still change.

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
He said, yes, but we'd never know it because we've defined the meter in terms of the speed of light.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
So the units had changed with it.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
So he looked very pleased about that.

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
They'd fixed that problem.

12:06.000 --> 12:13.000
But I said, well, then what about big G, the gravitational constant known in the trade as big G is written with a capital G,

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
Newton's universal gravitational constant.

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
That's varied by more than 1.3% in recent years.

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
And it seems to vary from place to place and from time to time.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
And he said, oh, well, those are just errors.

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
And unfortunately, there are quite big errors with big G.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
So I said, well, what if it's really changing?

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
I mean, perhaps it is really changing.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
And then I looked at how they do it.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
What happens is they measure it in different labs.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
They get different values on different days.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
And then they average them.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
And then other labs around the world do the same.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
And they come out usually with a rather different average.

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
And then the International Committee on Metrology meets every 10 years or so

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
and average the ones from labs around the world to come up with the value of big G.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
But what if G were actually fluctuating?

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
What if it changed?

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
There's already evidence, actually, that it changes throughout the day and throughout the year.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
What if the Earth, as it moves through the galactic environment,

13:07.000 --> 13:12.000
went through patches of dark matter or other environmental factors that could alter it?

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Maybe they all change together.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
What if these errors are going up together and down together?

13:17.000 --> 13:22.000
For more than 10 years, I've been trying to persuade metrologists to look at the raw data.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
In fact, I'm now trying to persuade them to put it online, on the internet,

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
with the dates and the actual measurements, and see if they're correlated,

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
to see if they're all up at one time, all down at another.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
If so, they might be fluctuating together.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
And that would tell us something very, very interesting.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
But no one has done this.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
They haven't done it because G is a constant.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
There's no point looking for changes.

13:42.000 --> 13:48.000
You see, here's a very simple example of where a dogmatic assumption actually inhibits inquiry.

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
I, myself, think that the constants may vary quite considerably,

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
well, within narrow limits, but they may all be varying.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
And I think the day will come when scientific journals, like Nature,

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
have a weekly report on the constants, like stock market reports and newspapers.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
This week, Big G was slightly up.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
The charge on the electron was down.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
The speed of light held steady and so on.

14:11.000 --> 14:19.000
That's one area, just one area where I think thinking less dogmatically could open things up.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
One of the biggest areas is the nature of the mind.

14:22.000 --> 14:28.000
This is the most unsolved problem that science simply can't deal with the fact we're conscious.

14:28.000 --> 14:34.000
And it can't deal with the fact that our thoughts don't seem to be inside our brains.

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
Our experiences don't all seem to be inside our brain.

14:38.000 --> 14:42.000
Your image of me now doesn't seem to be inside your brain,

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
yet the official view is there's a little rupert somewhere inside your head.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
And everything else in this room is inside your head.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Your experience is inside your brain.

14:50.000 --> 14:55.000
I'm suggesting, actually, that vision involves an outward projection of images.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
What you're seeing is in your mind, but not inside your head.

14:57.000 --> 15:02.000
Our minds are extended beyond our brains in the simplest act of perception.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
I think that we project out the images we're seeing.

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
And these images touch what we're looking at.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
If I look at you from behind, you don't know I'm there.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Could I affect you?

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Could you feel my gaze?

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
There's a great deal of evidence that people can.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
The sense of being stared at is an extremely common experience.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
And recent experimental research suggests it's real.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Animals seem to have it too.

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
I think it probably evolved in the context of predator-prey relationships.

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
Prey animals that could feel the gaze of a predator would survive better than those that couldn't.

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
This would lead to a whole new way of thinking about ecological relationships

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
between predators and prey, also about the extent of our minds.

15:42.000 --> 15:47.000
If we look at distant stars, I think our minds reach out in a sense to touch those stars

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
and literally extend out over astronomical distances.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
They're not just inside our heads.

15:54.000 --> 15:58.000
Now, it may seem astonishing that this is a topic of debate in the 21st century.

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
We know so little about our own minds that where our images are

16:02.000 --> 16:07.000
is a hot topic of debate within consciousness studies right now.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
I don't have time to deal with any more of these dogmas,

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
but every single one of them is questionable.

16:12.000 --> 16:17.000
If one questions it, new forms of research, new possibilities open up.

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
And I think as we question these dogmas that have held back science so long,

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
science will undergo a reflaring, a renaissance.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
I'm a total believer in the importance of science.

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
I've spent my whole life as a research scientist, my whole career.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
But I think by moving beyond these dogmas, it can be regenerated.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
Once again, it can become interesting and I hope life affirming.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Thank you.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Thank you.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Thank you.
