0	13040	The way you design the world in your mind
13040	16080	is the way you relate to it in the real world.
16080	20880	And when you design it as dead matter just to be exploited,
20880	23160	you will exploit it.
23160	27240	When you design it without any understanding of limits,
27240	30920	you will violate the planetary limits.
30920	33240	When you design it with deep recognition
33240	38520	of interconnectedness, you will nurture those relationships.
38520	42880	And this basic recognition is what
42880	48920	I drew from my learnings in quantum theory,
48920	53280	that non-locality, non-separation, interconnectedness,
53280	56600	that is the nature of reality.
56600	60720	But we have a design in the paradigm
60720	67200	of mechanistic thought which didn't evolve.
67200	69360	It was imposed.
69360	71600	That mechanistic thought is based first
71600	76360	on the assumption that we are separate from nature.
76360	79960	And nature is constituted of discrete particles
79960	84000	separate from each other who can only relate through violence,
84000	87800	through force, through action by contact.
87800	90440	In the quantum world, there is no separability.
90440	94200	My thesis was on non-locality in quantum theory.
94200	97440	Everything is interconnected.
97440	101280	There are no fixed, essentialized qualities
101280	105040	that have been built into the way.
105040	106640	People are looked at.
106640	108720	Nature is looked at.
108720	114440	Potential is the defining quality in the quantum world.
114440	116880	And because it's about potential,
116880	119960	it's also about uncertainty.
119960	124520	The mechanical world is based on a false illusion
124520	127880	of determinateness, certainty.
127880	132000	And in the quantum world, we know
132000	135280	we cannot get rid of uncertainty, the uncertainty
135280	138960	principle of Eisenberg.
138960	142160	To this is linked to the fourth principle,
142160	147920	no excluded middle, no duality, no either or.
147920	152480	In the quantum world, it's and.
152480	155240	In the mechanistic world, you can either
155240	158160	be a wave or a particle.
158160	159760	In the quantum world, you have potential
159760	162400	to be both and they're complementary.
162400	167720	When you realize that the world is one interconnected whole,
167720	174680	you also realize that what appears different
174680	177200	is actually different expressions
177200	178520	of an interconnected reality.
183120	186240	For the first time in human history,
186240	189160	technology in the hands of the billionaires
189160	192920	becomes the new civilizing mission for humanity.
192920	198680	The illusions about the big technology firms
198680	206560	is they create, they extract, they don't create anything.
206560	214640	Software programmers create the platforms that they use.
214640	217720	Even Bill Gates didn't really write his basic program,
217720	222080	it was two math professors in Dartmouth College
222080	225160	who did the basic program.
225160	228880	They have posited themselves as inventors.
228880	233320	When basically we've done a new report,
233320	236920	because Bill Gates announced a new project called Ag 1.
236920	239520	All agriculture will be one agriculture control by him.
239520	242280	Where does he set up the office of Ag 1?
242280	246160	In Missouri, Women's Center's headquarters.
246160	248320	But we watch what's going on in India
248320	249800	and we piece it together.
249800	253720	So basically he's financing a lot of data mining
253720	257480	from farmers, which will then be packaged back
257480	259800	as big data and sold back to the farmers.
259800	263880	But this is exactly what happened in your 2016 elections.
263880	269000	Facebook sold data to Cambridge Analytica.
269000	272320	So when you think of why are the kind of leaders
272320	274480	that we have getting created, it's
274480	277840	very important to remember that in these 25 years
277840	281000	of corporate deregulation of commerce,
281000	284480	you basically have a lot of money
284480	287040	in the hands of very few people.
287040	290960	And they then are the ones investing in all the companies.
290960	293240	The companies are not independent companies anymore.
293240	295760	They're basically billionaire money managed
295760	301920	by the investment funds like BlackRock and Vanguard, et cetera.
301920	306360	They also know that everywhere people are on the streets.
306360	308880	Just look at this here.
308880	312920	Show me a country where there weren't protests.
312920	319400	Chile, Beirut, Hong Kong, everywhere.
319400	328200	So how do you deal with the rising demand for a change?
328200	332640	We threw out the East India Company in 1857.
332640	334880	The crown took over.
334880	340040	They established a policy called divide and rule.
340040	344400	And then they started to divide Hindus and Muslims
344400	346600	because Hindus and Muslims had stood together
346600	350400	to defend their land, their livelihoods, their freedom.
350400	358400	It took from 1857 to about 1920 for all kinds of means,
358400	364200	censors, fake identity, because people in India
364200	365600	would say, I'm a Hindu and a Muslim.
365600	368800	Because they'd go to mosques and they'd go to temples.
368800	370880	And when they'd be asked, who are you,
370880	372640	they'd say, I'm a gardener.
372640	374240	I'm a blacksmith.
374240	378800	For them, the religious part was very, very secondary.
378800	381320	Their occupation was their main identity, the place
381320	383720	where they came from, the community they came from.
383720	390280	And this took so long, this is what led to our partition.
390280	392160	And that partition is still being played out.
392160	394640	It's an incomplete project.
394640	400960	So divide and rule becomes a necessity for the 1%
400960	403760	to continue to hold on to power.
403760	407640	What are the economic policies being pushed
407640	411800	while people are divided?
411800	413040	Because that's really the agenda.
416800	421440	In 1906, when this divide and rule and apartheid
421440	423240	was being put in place, apartheid hadn't
423240	425200	been named apartheid then.
425200	428240	It was only named as a system in 1948.
428240	434240	But in 1906, the British wanted to turn Indians
434240	436720	in South Africa into second-class citizens.
436720	439080	So they wrote an Indian Act.
439080	444160	And Indians had to carry, had to register on race.
444160	446600	And they had to carry their identities all the time.
446600	448640	And a lot of what's happening right now in India
448640	450960	around this identity issue is related
450960	453720	to that history of the Satyagre.
453720	456520	But most importantly, any police officer
456520	461360	could enter your house at any time and demand your papers.
461360	463080	You couldn't trade locally.
463080	465200	You couldn't practice professions.
465200	472120	And so the people said, we would rather die.
472120	476880	This refusal to cooperate with unjust law
476880	480800	is what Gandhi calls Satyagre, as a duty, as a duty of truth.
480800	484080	He was inspired by Thoreau, who refused
484080	488360	to pay the poll tax here against the slave system.
488360	491880	He inspired Martin Luther King.
491880	496520	And the civil rights movement is very much inspired by Gandhi.
496520	499160	But it is when King started to take up
499160	502360	the economic justice and economic equality issues,
502360	504160	that's when he was assassinated.
504160	508320	Because the part is you can talk in very sweet ways
508320	513240	about civil liberties, but you don't touch economic justice.
513240	517760	And the economy is, for me, it's a double violence
517760	521840	because the origin of the word, the meaning of the word economy,
521840	525040	comes from Oikosa home.
525040	532000	The Aristotelian name is Oikonomia, the art of living.
532000	533760	And when you turn the art of living
533760	536200	into the art of money making, which Aristotle
536200	539720	called chromatistics, then you have
539720	541640	to practice violence against the earth
541640	545680	and violence against others, destroy their livelihoods,
545680	548720	destroy their freedoms, take away their resources.
548720	550400	So the violence is multiple.
550400	553000	And I look into the future.
553000	556400	I say, why are we building detention centers everywhere
556400	559520	in India along the border of Mexico?
559520	564320	Because I feel that if we don't activate
564320	569960	our sense of interconnectedness with all life, with all people,
569960	572200	if we don't start sowing the seeds of what
572200	574920	I have called earth democracy, we
574920	579600	are going to see 99% people as disposable,
579600	584440	especially with the tech working on artificial intelligence,
584440	588480	to make sure all the mechanical work is made redundant.
588480	592280	Whether it be in radiography or law or whatever,
592280	596480	mechanical work will be substituted.
596480	601480	And if that's the case, 99% people are disposable.
601480	604440	So you can either share this beautiful planet
604440	607680	with love and abundance and sustainability,
607680	612600	or say it's all mine, every bit of land, every seed,
612600	617760	every mind, because what's being mined is our mind now.
617760	621960	And if we don't defend the freedoms of all species
621960	623800	and the freedoms of all human beings,
623800	627280	we could see within 20, 30 years,
627280	631600	a level of disposability built into the structures
631600	634240	that humanity will not be able to respond to.
634240	638640	So this is the time to make oneness and interconnectedness
638640	641800	as one humanity on one planet, the political project
641800	642480	of our times.
646440	649960	We have to remember we are one humanity.
649960	652240	We are part of one earth.
652240	655640	And whatever we do, we will not let
655640	663200	this basic recognition divide us, either from the earth
663200	664920	or from each other.
664920	666080	And together, we are strong.
666620	667240	Thank you.
668600	669560	Thank you.
669560	670620	Thank you.
670620	672500	Thank you very much.
672500	674220	Thank you.
674220	674980	Thank you.
675380	675500	移民.
675500	676380	Thank you.
676380	676600	And take care.
676600	682600	Thank you very much.
690260	693680	Isn't there a VHP for those of you
693680	709680	Quick reminder, God playing hide and seek, my mission is to find, step by step, as I walk through the valley in the shadow of death, I feel no threat, the earth is the block I rep, no fear when I step, God steady clearing the debt, I earn the respect.
709680	721680	C'est la vie, c'est la vie, they only bring war, but they try to call it peace, divide, then conquer the mark of the beast, oppression and control in the name of democracy.
