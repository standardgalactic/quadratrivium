1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,040
The way you design the world in your mind

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,080
is the way you relate to it in the real world.

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,880
And when you design it as dead matter just to be exploited,

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,160
you will exploit it.

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,240
When you design it without any understanding of limits,

6
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,920
you will violate the planetary limits.

7
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,240
When you design it with deep recognition

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:38,520
of interconnectedness, you will nurture those relationships.

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,880
And this basic recognition is what

10
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:48,920
I drew from my learnings in quantum theory,

11
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,280
that non-locality, non-separation, interconnectedness,

12
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,600
that is the nature of reality.

13
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,720
But we have a design in the paradigm

14
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:07,200
of mechanistic thought which didn't evolve.

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,360
It was imposed.

16
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,600
That mechanistic thought is based first

17
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,360
on the assumption that we are separate from nature.

18
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,960
And nature is constituted of discrete particles

19
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,000
separate from each other who can only relate through violence,

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,800
through force, through action by contact.

21
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,440
In the quantum world, there is no separability.

22
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,200
My thesis was on non-locality in quantum theory.

23
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,440
Everything is interconnected.

24
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,280
There are no fixed, essentialized qualities

25
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,040
that have been built into the way.

26
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,640
People are looked at.

27
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,720
Nature is looked at.

28
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,440
Potential is the defining quality in the quantum world.

29
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,880
And because it's about potential,

30
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,960
it's also about uncertainty.

31
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:04,520
The mechanical world is based on a false illusion

32
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,880
of determinateness, certainty.

33
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,000
And in the quantum world, we know

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,280
we cannot get rid of uncertainty, the uncertainty

35
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,960
principle of Eisenberg.

36
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,160
To this is linked to the fourth principle,

37
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,920
no excluded middle, no duality, no either or.

38
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,480
In the quantum world, it's and.

39
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,240
In the mechanistic world, you can either

40
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,160
be a wave or a particle.

41
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,760
In the quantum world, you have potential

42
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,400
to be both and they're complementary.

43
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,720
When you realize that the world is one interconnected whole,

44
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:54,680
you also realize that what appears different

45
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,200
is actually different expressions

46
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,520
of an interconnected reality.

47
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,240
For the first time in human history,

48
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,160
technology in the hands of the billionaires

49
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,920
becomes the new civilizing mission for humanity.

50
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:18,680
The illusions about the big technology firms

51
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:26,560
is they create, they extract, they don't create anything.

52
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:34,640
Software programmers create the platforms that they use.

53
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,720
Even Bill Gates didn't really write his basic program,

54
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,080
it was two math professors in Dartmouth College

55
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,160
who did the basic program.

56
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,880
They have posited themselves as inventors.

57
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,320
When basically we've done a new report,

58
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,920
because Bill Gates announced a new project called Ag 1.

59
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,520
All agriculture will be one agriculture control by him.

60
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,280
Where does he set up the office of Ag 1?

61
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,160
In Missouri, Women's Center's headquarters.

62
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,320
But we watch what's going on in India

63
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,800
and we piece it together.

64
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,720
So basically he's financing a lot of data mining

65
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,480
from farmers, which will then be packaged back

66
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,800
as big data and sold back to the farmers.

67
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,880
But this is exactly what happened in your 2016 elections.

68
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:29,000
Facebook sold data to Cambridge Analytica.

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,320
So when you think of why are the kind of leaders

70
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,480
that we have getting created, it's

71
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,840
very important to remember that in these 25 years

72
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,000
of corporate deregulation of commerce,

73
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,480
you basically have a lot of money

74
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,040
in the hands of very few people.

75
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,960
And they then are the ones investing in all the companies.

76
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,240
The companies are not independent companies anymore.

77
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,760
They're basically billionaire money managed

78
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:01,920
by the investment funds like BlackRock and Vanguard, et cetera.

79
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:06,360
They also know that everywhere people are on the streets.

80
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,880
Just look at this here.

81
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,920
Show me a country where there weren't protests.

82
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:19,400
Chile, Beirut, Hong Kong, everywhere.

83
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:28,200
So how do you deal with the rising demand for a change?

84
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,640
We threw out the East India Company in 1857.

85
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,880
The crown took over.

86
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,040
They established a policy called divide and rule.

87
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:44,400
And then they started to divide Hindus and Muslims

88
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,600
because Hindus and Muslims had stood together

89
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,400
to defend their land, their livelihoods, their freedom.

90
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:58,400
It took from 1857 to about 1920 for all kinds of means,

91
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:04,200
censors, fake identity, because people in India

92
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,600
would say, I'm a Hindu and a Muslim.

93
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,800
Because they'd go to mosques and they'd go to temples.

94
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,880
And when they'd be asked, who are you,

95
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,640
they'd say, I'm a gardener.

96
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,240
I'm a blacksmith.

97
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,800
For them, the religious part was very, very secondary.

98
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,320
Their occupation was their main identity, the place

99
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,720
where they came from, the community they came from.

100
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:30,280
And this took so long, this is what led to our partition.

101
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,160
And that partition is still being played out.

102
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,640
It's an incomplete project.

103
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:40,960
So divide and rule becomes a necessity for the 1%

104
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,760
to continue to hold on to power.

105
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,640
What are the economic policies being pushed

106
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,800
while people are divided?

107
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,040
Because that's really the agenda.

108
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,440
In 1906, when this divide and rule and apartheid

109
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,240
was being put in place, apartheid hadn't

110
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,200
been named apartheid then.

111
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,240
It was only named as a system in 1948.

112
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:14,240
But in 1906, the British wanted to turn Indians

113
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,720
in South Africa into second-class citizens.

114
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,080
So they wrote an Indian Act.

115
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:24,160
And Indians had to carry, had to register on race.

116
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,600
And they had to carry their identities all the time.

117
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,640
And a lot of what's happening right now in India

118
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,960
around this identity issue is related

119
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,720
to that history of the Satyagre.

120
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,520
But most importantly, any police officer

121
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:41,360
could enter your house at any time and demand your papers.

122
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,080
You couldn't trade locally.

123
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,200
You couldn't practice professions.

124
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:52,120
And so the people said, we would rather die.

125
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,880
This refusal to cooperate with unjust law

126
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,800
is what Gandhi calls Satyagre, as a duty, as a duty of truth.

127
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,080
He was inspired by Thoreau, who refused

128
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,360
to pay the poll tax here against the slave system.

129
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,880
He inspired Martin Luther King.

130
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:16,520
And the civil rights movement is very much inspired by Gandhi.

131
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,160
But it is when King started to take up

132
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,360
the economic justice and economic equality issues,

133
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,160
that's when he was assassinated.

134
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,320
Because the part is you can talk in very sweet ways

135
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:33,240
about civil liberties, but you don't touch economic justice.

136
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,760
And the economy is, for me, it's a double violence

137
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,840
because the origin of the word, the meaning of the word economy,

138
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,040
comes from Oikosa home.

139
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:52,000
The Aristotelian name is Oikonomia, the art of living.

140
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,760
And when you turn the art of living

141
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,200
into the art of money making, which Aristotle

142
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,720
called chromatistics, then you have

143
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,640
to practice violence against the earth

144
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,680
and violence against others, destroy their livelihoods,

145
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,720
destroy their freedoms, take away their resources.

146
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,400
So the violence is multiple.

147
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,000
And I look into the future.

148
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,400
I say, why are we building detention centers everywhere

149
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,520
in India along the border of Mexico?

150
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:24,320
Because I feel that if we don't activate

151
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,960
our sense of interconnectedness with all life, with all people,

152
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,200
if we don't start sowing the seeds of what

153
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,920
I have called earth democracy, we

154
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:39,600
are going to see 99% people as disposable,

155
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,440
especially with the tech working on artificial intelligence,

156
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,480
to make sure all the mechanical work is made redundant.

157
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,280
Whether it be in radiography or law or whatever,

158
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:56,480
mechanical work will be substituted.

159
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,480
And if that's the case, 99% people are disposable.

160
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,440
So you can either share this beautiful planet

161
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,680
with love and abundance and sustainability,

162
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,600
or say it's all mine, every bit of land, every seed,

163
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,760
every mind, because what's being mined is our mind now.

164
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,960
And if we don't defend the freedoms of all species

165
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,800
and the freedoms of all human beings,

166
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,280
we could see within 20, 30 years,

167
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,600
a level of disposability built into the structures

168
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,240
that humanity will not be able to respond to.

169
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,640
So this is the time to make oneness and interconnectedness

170
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,800
as one humanity on one planet, the political project

171
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,480
of our times.

172
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,960
We have to remember we are one humanity.

173
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,240
We are part of one earth.

174
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,640
And whatever we do, we will not let

175
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:03,200
this basic recognition divide us, either from the earth

176
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,920
or from each other.

177
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,080
And together, we are strong.

178
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,240
Thank you.

179
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,560
