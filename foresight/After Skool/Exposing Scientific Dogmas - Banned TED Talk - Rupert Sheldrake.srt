1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,960
The

2
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,560
science delusion is the belief that science already understands the nature

3
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:34,160
of reality in principle, leaving any of the details to be filled in.

4
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,440
This is a very widespread belief in our society.

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,920
It's the kind of belief system of people who say,

6
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,720
I don't believe in God, I believe in science.

7
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:48,880
It's a belief system which has now been spread to the entire world.

8
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,800
But there's a conflict in the heart of science between science

9
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,520
as a method of inquiry based on reason, evidence, hypothesis,

10
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:02,240
and collective investigation, and science as a belief system or a world view.

11
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,720
And unfortunately, the world view aspect of science has come to inhibit and

12
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,040
constrict the free inquiry, which is the very lifeblood of the scientific endeavor.

13
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,800
Since the late 19th century, science has been conducted under the aspect of a belief

14
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,800
system or world view, which is essentially that of materialism,

15
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,120
philosophical materialism.

16
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,760
And these sciences are now wholly owned subsidiaries of the materialist world view.

17
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,080
I think that as we break out of it, the sciences will be regenerated.

18
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,600
What I do in my book, The Science Delusion,

19
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,520
which is called Science Set Free in the United States,

20
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,520
is take the ten dogmas or assumptions of science and turn them into questions.

21
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,680
Seeing how well they stand up if you look at them scientifically.

22
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,680
None of them stand up very well.

23
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,880
What I'm going to do is first run through what these ten dogmas are,

24
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,560
and then I'll only have time to discuss one or two of them in a bit more detail.

25
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,320
But essentially the ten dogmas, which are the default world view of most educated

26
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,600
people all over the world, are first the nature's mechanical or machine-like.

27
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,480
The universe is like a machine.

28
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,520
Animals and plants are like machines.

29
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,680
We're like machines.

30
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,360
In fact, we are machines.

31
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,440
We're lumbering robots in Richard Dawkins' vivid phrase,

32
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,320
with brains that are genetically programmed computers.

33
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,760
Second, matter is unconscious.

34
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,320
The whole universe is made up of unconscious matter.

35
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,160
There's no consciousness in stars, in galaxies, in planets, in animals, in plants.

36
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,800
And there ought not to be any in us either, if this theory is true.

37
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,920
So a lot of the philosophy of mind over the last hundred years is being trying

38
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,880
to prove that we're not really conscious at all.

39
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:01,000
So the matter's unconscious, then the laws of nature are fixed.

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,560
This is dogma three.

41
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,320
The laws of nature are the same now as they were at the time of the Big Bang,

42
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,120
and they'll be the same forever.

43
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,560
Not just the laws, but the constants of nature are fixed,

44
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,120
which is why they're called constants.

45
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,480
Dogma four, the total amount of matter and energy is always the same.

46
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,400
It never changes in total quantity, except at the moment of the Big Bang,

47
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,560
when it all sprang into existence from nowhere in a single instant.

48
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,800
The fifth dogma is that nature's purposeless.

49
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:36,600
There are no purposers in all nature, and the evolutionary process has no purpose or direction.

50
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:43,400
Dogma six, the biological heredity is material.

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,080
Everything you inherit is in your genes or in epigenetic modifications of the genes

52
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,440
or in cytoplasmic inheritance.

53
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,360
It's material.

54
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,360
Dogma seven, memories are stored inside your brain as material traces.

55
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,080
Somehow everything you remember is in your brain in modified nerve endings,

56
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,600
phosphorylated proteins.

57
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,360
No one knows how it works, but nevertheless,

58
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,520
almost everyone in the scientific world believes it must be in the brain.

59
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,800
Dogma eight, your mind is inside your head.

60
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,600
All your consciousness is the activity of your brain and nothing more.

61
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,080
Dogma nine, which follows from dogma eight,

62
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,240
psychic phenomena like telepathy are impossible.

63
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,520
Your thoughts and intentions cannot have any effect at a distance

64
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,760
because your mind is inside your head.

65
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:35,080
Therefore, all the apparent evidence for telepathy and other psychic phenomena is illusory.

66
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,480
People believe these things happen,

67
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,440
but it's just because they don't know enough about statistics

68
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,760
or they're deceived by coincidences or it's wishful thinking.

69
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,080
And dogma ten, mechanistic medicine is the only kind that really works.

70
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,520
That's why governments only fund research into mechanistic medicine

71
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,840
and ignore complementary and alternative therapies.

72
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,320
Those can't possibly really work because they're not mechanistic.

73
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,760
They may appear to work because people would have got better anyway

74
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,960
or because of the placebo effect.

75
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,040
But the only kind that really works is mechanistic medicine.

76
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,920
Well, this is the default world view,

77
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,760
which is held by almost all educated people all over the world.

78
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,360
It's the basis of the educational system, the National Health Service,

79
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,120
the Medical Research Council, governments,

80
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,160
and it's just the default world view of educated people.

81
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,720
But I think every one of these dogmas is very, very questionable.

82
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,440
And when you look at it, they fall apart.

83
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,840
I'm going to take first the idea that the laws of nature are fixed.

84
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,000
This is a hangover from an older world view

85
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,480
before the 1960s when the Big Bang Theory came in.

86
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,640
People thought that the whole universe was eternal,

87
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,760
governed by eternal mathematical laws.

88
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,320
When the Big Bang came in, then that assumption continued,

89
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,840
even though the Big Bang revealed a universe that's radically evolutionary,

90
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,840
about 14 billion years old,

91
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,120
growing and developing and evolving for 14 billion years,

92
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,120
growing and cooling and more structures and patterns appear within it.

93
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,360
But the idea is all the laws of nature were completely fixed

94
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,360
at the moment of the Big Bang, like a cosmic Napoleonic code.

95
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,840
As my friend Terence McKenna used to say,

96
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,800
modern science is based on the principle,

97
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,960
give us one free miracle and we'll explain the rest.

98
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,840
And the one free miracle is the appearance of all the matter and energy

99
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,840
in the universe and all the laws that govern it

100
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,840
from nothing in a single instant.

101
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,320
Well, in an evolutionary universe,

102
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,320
why shouldn't the laws themselves evolve?

103
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,720
After all, human laws do,

104
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,800
and the idea of laws of nature is based on a metaphor with human laws.

105
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,880
It's a very anthropocentric metaphor.

106
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,520
Only humans have laws, in fact, only civilized societies have laws.

107
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,080
As C.S. Lewis once said,

108
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,000
to say that a stone falls to earth because it's obeying a law

109
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
and makes it a man and even a citizen.

110
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's a metaphor that we got so used to, we forget it's a metaphor.

111
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
In an evolving universe, I think a much better idea is the idea of habits.

112
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I think the habits of nature evolve,

113
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
the regularities of nature are essentially habitual.

114
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
This was an idea put forward at the beginning of the 20th century

115
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
by the American philosopher C.S. Perse.

116
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And it's an idea which various other philosophers have entertained,

117
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
and it's one which I myself have developed into a scientific hypothesis,

118
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
the hypothesis of morphic resonance,

119
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
which is the basis of these evolving habits.

120
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
According to this hypothesis,

121
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
everything in nature has a kind of collective memory.

122
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Resonance occurs on the basis of similarity.

123
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
As a young giraffe, embryo grows in its mother's womb.

124
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It tunes in to the morphic resonance of previous giraffes.

125
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It draws on that collective memory.

126
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It grows like a giraffe and it behaves like a giraffe

127
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
because it's drawing on this collective memory.

128
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It has to have the right genes to make the right proteins,

129
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
but genes in my view are grossly overrated.

130
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
They only account for the proteins that the organism can make,

131
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
not the shape or the form or the behavior.

132
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Every species has a kind of collective memory, even crystals do.

133
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
This theory predicts that if you make a new kind of crystal for the first time,

134
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
the very first time you make it, it won't have an existing habit.

135
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
But once it crystallizes, then the next time you make it,

136
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
there'll be an influence from the first crystals to the second ones all over the world.

137
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
By morphic resonance, it'll crystallize a bit easier.

138
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
The third time, there'll be an influence from the first and second crystals.

139
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
There is in fact good evidence that new compounds get easier to crystallize all around the world,

140
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
just as this theory would predict.

141
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It also predicts that if you train animals to learn a new trick,

142
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
for example, rats learn a new trick in London,

143
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
then all around the world rats of the same breed should learn the same trick quicker

144
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
just because the rats have landed here.

145
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And surprisingly, there's already evidence that this actually happens.

146
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Anyway, that's my own hypothesis in a nutshell of morphic resonance.

147
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Everything depends on evolving habits, not on fixed laws.

148
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
But I want to spend a few moments on the constants of nature, too,

149
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
because these, again, are assumed to be constant.

150
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Things like the gravitational constant, the speed of light, are called the fundamental constants.

151
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Are they really constant?

152
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Well, when I got interested in this question, I tried to find out.

153
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
They're given in physics handbooks.

154
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Handbooks of physics list the existing fundamental constants and tell you their value.

155
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
But I wanted to see if they'd change, so I got the old volumes of physical handbooks.

156
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I went to the Patent Office Library here in London,

157
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
and they're the only place I could find that kept the old volumes.

158
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Normally, people throw them away when the new values come out.

159
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
They throw away the old ones.

160
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
When I did this, I found that the speed of light dropped between 1928 and 1945

161
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
by about 20 kilometers per second.

162
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's a huge drop because they're given with errors of any fractions,

163
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
decimals points of error.

164
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And yet, all over the world, it dropped,

165
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
and they were all getting values very similar to each other with tiny errors.

166
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Then in 1945, it went up at 48. It went up again.

167
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And then people started getting very similar values again.

168
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I was very intrigued by this, and I couldn't make sense of it,

169
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
so I went to see the head of metrology at the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington.

170
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Metrology is the science in which people measure constants.

171
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And I asked him about this.

172
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I said, what do you make of this drop in the speed of light between 1928 and 1945?

173
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And he said, oh dear, you've uncovered the most embarrassing episode in the history of our science.

174
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So I said, well, could the speed of light have actually dropped?

175
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And that would have amazing implications if so.

176
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
He said, no, no, of course it couldn't have actually dropped. It's a constant.

177
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
So, oh, well then, how do you explain the fact everyone was finding it going much slower during that period?

178
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Is it because they were fudging their results to get what they thought other people should be getting,

179
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
and the whole thing was just produced by, in the minds of physicists?

180
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
He said, we don't like to use the word fudge.

181
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I said, well, what do you prefer?

182
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
He said, well, we prefer to call it intellectual phase locking.

183
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So I said, well, if it was going on then, how can we be so sure it's not going on today?

184
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And that the present values are produced by intellectual phase locking.

185
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And he said, oh, we know that's not the case.

186
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I said, how do we know?

187
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
He said, well, we've solved the problem.

188
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And I said, well, how?

189
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
He said, well, we fixed the speed of light by definition in 1972.

190
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So I said, but it might still change.

191
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
He said, yes, but we'd never know it because we've defined the meter in terms of the speed of light.

192
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So the units had changed with it.

193
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So he looked very pleased about that.

194
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
They'd fixed that problem.

195
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:13,000
But I said, well, then what about big G, the gravitational constant known in the trade as big G is written with a capital G,

196
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Newton's universal gravitational constant.

197
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
That's varied by more than 1.3% in recent years.

198
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
And it seems to vary from place to place and from time to time.

199
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And he said, oh, well, those are just errors.

200
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And unfortunately, there are quite big errors with big G.

201
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
So I said, well, what if it's really changing?

202
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I mean, perhaps it is really changing.

203
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And then I looked at how they do it.

204
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
What happens is they measure it in different labs.

205
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
They get different values on different days.

206
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And then they average them.

207
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And then other labs around the world do the same.

208
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
And they come out usually with a rather different average.

209
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And then the International Committee on Metrology meets every 10 years or so

210
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
and average the ones from labs around the world to come up with the value of big G.

211
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
But what if G were actually fluctuating?

212
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
What if it changed?

213
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
There's already evidence, actually, that it changes throughout the day and throughout the year.

214
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
What if the Earth, as it moves through the galactic environment,

215
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
went through patches of dark matter or other environmental factors that could alter it?

216
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Maybe they all change together.

217
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
What if these errors are going up together and down together?

218
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
For more than 10 years, I've been trying to persuade metrologists to look at the raw data.

219
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
In fact, I'm now trying to persuade them to put it online, on the internet,

220
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
with the dates and the actual measurements, and see if they're correlated,

221
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
to see if they're all up at one time, all down at another.

222
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
If so, they might be fluctuating together.

223
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And that would tell us something very, very interesting.

224
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
But no one has done this.

225
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
They haven't done it because G is a constant.

226
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
There's no point looking for changes.

227
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You see, here's a very simple example of where a dogmatic assumption actually inhibits inquiry.

228
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I, myself, think that the constants may vary quite considerably,

229
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
well, within narrow limits, but they may all be varying.

230
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And I think the day will come when scientific journals, like Nature,

231
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
have a weekly report on the constants, like stock market reports and newspapers.

232
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
This week, Big G was slightly up.

233
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
The charge on the electron was down.

234
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
The speed of light held steady and so on.

235
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:19,000
That's one area, just one area where I think thinking less dogmatically could open things up.

236
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
One of the biggest areas is the nature of the mind.

237
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
This is the most unsolved problem that science simply can't deal with the fact we're conscious.

238
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And it can't deal with the fact that our thoughts don't seem to be inside our brains.

239
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Our experiences don't all seem to be inside our brain.

240
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Your image of me now doesn't seem to be inside your brain,

241
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
yet the official view is there's a little rupert somewhere inside your head.

242
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
And everything else in this room is inside your head.

243
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Your experience is inside your brain.

244
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm suggesting, actually, that vision involves an outward projection of images.

245
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
What you're seeing is in your mind, but not inside your head.

246
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Our minds are extended beyond our brains in the simplest act of perception.

247
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I think that we project out the images we're seeing.

248
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And these images touch what we're looking at.

249
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
If I look at you from behind, you don't know I'm there.

250
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Could I affect you?

251
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Could you feel my gaze?

252
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
There's a great deal of evidence that people can.

253
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
The sense of being stared at is an extremely common experience.

254
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And recent experimental research suggests it's real.

255
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Animals seem to have it too.

256
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I think it probably evolved in the context of predator-prey relationships.

257
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Prey animals that could feel the gaze of a predator would survive better than those that couldn't.

258
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
This would lead to a whole new way of thinking about ecological relationships

259
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
between predators and prey, also about the extent of our minds.

260
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
If we look at distant stars, I think our minds reach out in a sense to touch those stars

261
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
and literally extend out over astronomical distances.

262
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
They're not just inside our heads.

263
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Now, it may seem astonishing that this is a topic of debate in the 21st century.

264
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
We know so little about our own minds that where our images are

265
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
is a hot topic of debate within consciousness studies right now.

266
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I don't have time to deal with any more of these dogmas,

267
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
but every single one of them is questionable.

268
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
If one questions it, new forms of research, new possibilities open up.

269
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
And I think as we question these dogmas that have held back science so long,

270
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
science will undergo a reflaring, a renaissance.

271
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm a total believer in the importance of science.

272
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I've spent my whole life as a research scientist, my whole career.

273
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
But I think by moving beyond these dogmas, it can be regenerated.

274
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Once again, it can become interesting and I hope life affirming.

275
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Thank you.

276
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Thank you.

277
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Thank you.
