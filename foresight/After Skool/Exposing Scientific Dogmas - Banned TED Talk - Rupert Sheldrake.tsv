0	25960	The
25960	29560	science delusion is the belief that science already understands the nature
29560	34160	of reality in principle, leaving any of the details to be filled in.
34160	37440	This is a very widespread belief in our society.
37440	39920	It's the kind of belief system of people who say,
39920	42720	I don't believe in God, I believe in science.
42720	48880	It's a belief system which has now been spread to the entire world.
48880	51800	But there's a conflict in the heart of science between science
51800	56520	as a method of inquiry based on reason, evidence, hypothesis,
56560	62240	and collective investigation, and science as a belief system or a world view.
62240	66720	And unfortunately, the world view aspect of science has come to inhibit and
66720	71040	constrict the free inquiry, which is the very lifeblood of the scientific endeavor.
72960	78800	Since the late 19th century, science has been conducted under the aspect of a belief
78800	82800	system or world view, which is essentially that of materialism,
82800	85120	philosophical materialism.
85120	89760	And these sciences are now wholly owned subsidiaries of the materialist world view.
91800	96080	I think that as we break out of it, the sciences will be regenerated.
97640	99600	What I do in my book, The Science Delusion,
99600	102520	which is called Science Set Free in the United States,
103920	110520	is take the ten dogmas or assumptions of science and turn them into questions.
110520	114680	Seeing how well they stand up if you look at them scientifically.
116120	117680	None of them stand up very well.
118920	122880	What I'm going to do is first run through what these ten dogmas are,
122880	127560	and then I'll only have time to discuss one or two of them in a bit more detail.
127560	132320	But essentially the ten dogmas, which are the default world view of most educated
132320	137600	people all over the world, are first the nature's mechanical or machine-like.
137600	139480	The universe is like a machine.
139480	141520	Animals and plants are like machines.
141520	142680	We're like machines.
142840	144360	In fact, we are machines.
144360	148440	We're lumbering robots in Richard Dawkins' vivid phrase,
148440	151320	with brains that are genetically programmed computers.
152720	154760	Second, matter is unconscious.
154760	157320	The whole universe is made up of unconscious matter.
158720	164160	There's no consciousness in stars, in galaxies, in planets, in animals, in plants.
164160	167800	And there ought not to be any in us either, if this theory is true.
167800	171920	So a lot of the philosophy of mind over the last hundred years is being trying
171920	173880	to prove that we're not really conscious at all.
175720	181000	So the matter's unconscious, then the laws of nature are fixed.
181000	182560	This is dogma three.
182560	186320	The laws of nature are the same now as they were at the time of the Big Bang,
186320	188120	and they'll be the same forever.
188120	190560	Not just the laws, but the constants of nature are fixed,
190560	192120	which is why they're called constants.
193960	197480	Dogma four, the total amount of matter and energy is always the same.
198480	202400	It never changes in total quantity, except at the moment of the Big Bang,
202400	205560	when it all sprang into existence from nowhere in a single instant.
207040	209800	The fifth dogma is that nature's purposeless.
209800	216600	There are no purposers in all nature, and the evolutionary process has no purpose or direction.
217800	223400	Dogma six, the biological heredity is material.
224000	229080	Everything you inherit is in your genes or in epigenetic modifications of the genes
229080	231440	or in cytoplasmic inheritance.
231440	233360	It's material.
233360	238360	Dogma seven, memories are stored inside your brain as material traces.
238360	242080	Somehow everything you remember is in your brain in modified nerve endings,
242080	243600	phosphorylated proteins.
243600	246360	No one knows how it works, but nevertheless,
246360	249520	almost everyone in the scientific world believes it must be in the brain.
250520	253800	Dogma eight, your mind is inside your head.
253800	258600	All your consciousness is the activity of your brain and nothing more.
258600	261080	Dogma nine, which follows from dogma eight,
261080	264240	psychic phenomena like telepathy are impossible.
264240	267520	Your thoughts and intentions cannot have any effect at a distance
267520	269760	because your mind is inside your head.
269760	275080	Therefore, all the apparent evidence for telepathy and other psychic phenomena is illusory.
275960	277480	People believe these things happen,
277640	280440	but it's just because they don't know enough about statistics
280440	284760	or they're deceived by coincidences or it's wishful thinking.
285760	290080	And dogma ten, mechanistic medicine is the only kind that really works.
290080	294520	That's why governments only fund research into mechanistic medicine
294520	297840	and ignore complementary and alternative therapies.
297840	301320	Those can't possibly really work because they're not mechanistic.
301320	304760	They may appear to work because people would have got better anyway
304760	306960	or because of the placebo effect.
307680	311040	But the only kind that really works is mechanistic medicine.
312120	313920	Well, this is the default world view,
313920	317760	which is held by almost all educated people all over the world.
317760	322360	It's the basis of the educational system, the National Health Service,
322360	326120	the Medical Research Council, governments,
326120	330160	and it's just the default world view of educated people.
331400	335720	But I think every one of these dogmas is very, very questionable.
335760	339440	And when you look at it, they fall apart.
340760	344840	I'm going to take first the idea that the laws of nature are fixed.
344840	347000	This is a hangover from an older world view
347000	350480	before the 1960s when the Big Bang Theory came in.
350480	353640	People thought that the whole universe was eternal,
353640	355760	governed by eternal mathematical laws.
356920	360320	When the Big Bang came in, then that assumption continued,
360320	364840	even though the Big Bang revealed a universe that's radically evolutionary,
364840	366840	about 14 billion years old,
366840	371120	growing and developing and evolving for 14 billion years,
371120	375120	growing and cooling and more structures and patterns appear within it.
375120	378360	But the idea is all the laws of nature were completely fixed
378360	381360	at the moment of the Big Bang, like a cosmic Napoleonic code.
382440	384840	As my friend Terence McKenna used to say,
384840	386800	modern science is based on the principle,
386800	389960	give us one free miracle and we'll explain the rest.
389960	392840	And the one free miracle is the appearance of all the matter and energy
392840	394840	in the universe and all the laws that govern it
394840	396840	from nothing in a single instant.
398840	401320	Well, in an evolutionary universe,
401320	403320	why shouldn't the laws themselves evolve?
404280	405720	After all, human laws do,
405720	409800	and the idea of laws of nature is based on a metaphor with human laws.
409800	411880	It's a very anthropocentric metaphor.
411880	415520	Only humans have laws, in fact, only civilized societies have laws.
416520	418080	As C.S. Lewis once said,
418080	421000	to say that a stone falls to earth because it's obeying a law
421000	423000	and makes it a man and even a citizen.
424000	428000	It's a metaphor that we got so used to, we forget it's a metaphor.
428000	432000	In an evolving universe, I think a much better idea is the idea of habits.
432000	434000	I think the habits of nature evolve,
434000	437000	the regularities of nature are essentially habitual.
438000	442000	This was an idea put forward at the beginning of the 20th century
442000	444000	by the American philosopher C.S. Perse.
445000	448000	And it's an idea which various other philosophers have entertained,
448000	453000	and it's one which I myself have developed into a scientific hypothesis,
453000	455000	the hypothesis of morphic resonance,
455000	458000	which is the basis of these evolving habits.
458000	460000	According to this hypothesis,
460000	463000	everything in nature has a kind of collective memory.
463000	466000	Resonance occurs on the basis of similarity.
466000	470000	As a young giraffe, embryo grows in its mother's womb.
470000	474000	It tunes in to the morphic resonance of previous giraffes.
474000	476000	It draws on that collective memory.
476000	479000	It grows like a giraffe and it behaves like a giraffe
479000	481000	because it's drawing on this collective memory.
481000	484000	It has to have the right genes to make the right proteins,
484000	487000	but genes in my view are grossly overrated.
487000	490000	They only account for the proteins that the organism can make,
490000	493000	not the shape or the form or the behavior.
494000	498000	Every species has a kind of collective memory, even crystals do.
498000	502000	This theory predicts that if you make a new kind of crystal for the first time,
503000	508000	the very first time you make it, it won't have an existing habit.
508000	511000	But once it crystallizes, then the next time you make it,
511000	515000	there'll be an influence from the first crystals to the second ones all over the world.
515000	518000	By morphic resonance, it'll crystallize a bit easier.
518000	522000	The third time, there'll be an influence from the first and second crystals.
522000	527000	There is in fact good evidence that new compounds get easier to crystallize all around the world,
527000	529000	just as this theory would predict.
529000	533000	It also predicts that if you train animals to learn a new trick,
533000	536000	for example, rats learn a new trick in London,
536000	540000	then all around the world rats of the same breed should learn the same trick quicker
540000	542000	just because the rats have landed here.
542000	546000	And surprisingly, there's already evidence that this actually happens.
548000	551000	Anyway, that's my own hypothesis in a nutshell of morphic resonance.
551000	555000	Everything depends on evolving habits, not on fixed laws.
555000	559000	But I want to spend a few moments on the constants of nature, too,
559000	562000	because these, again, are assumed to be constant.
562000	567000	Things like the gravitational constant, the speed of light, are called the fundamental constants.
567000	570000	Are they really constant?
570000	573000	Well, when I got interested in this question, I tried to find out.
573000	576000	They're given in physics handbooks.
576000	581000	Handbooks of physics list the existing fundamental constants and tell you their value.
581000	586000	But I wanted to see if they'd change, so I got the old volumes of physical handbooks.
586000	589000	I went to the Patent Office Library here in London,
589000	592000	and they're the only place I could find that kept the old volumes.
592000	595000	Normally, people throw them away when the new values come out.
595000	597000	They throw away the old ones.
597000	602000	When I did this, I found that the speed of light dropped between 1928 and 1945
602000	605000	by about 20 kilometers per second.
605000	608000	It's a huge drop because they're given with errors of any fractions,
609000	611000	decimals points of error.
611000	614000	And yet, all over the world, it dropped,
614000	618000	and they were all getting values very similar to each other with tiny errors.
618000	622000	Then in 1945, it went up at 48. It went up again.
622000	626000	And then people started getting very similar values again.
626000	629000	I was very intrigued by this, and I couldn't make sense of it,
629000	634000	so I went to see the head of metrology at the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington.
634000	638000	Metrology is the science in which people measure constants.
638000	640000	And I asked him about this.
640000	645000	I said, what do you make of this drop in the speed of light between 1928 and 1945?
645000	651000	And he said, oh dear, you've uncovered the most embarrassing episode in the history of our science.
651000	655000	So I said, well, could the speed of light have actually dropped?
655000	658000	And that would have amazing implications if so.
658000	662000	He said, no, no, of course it couldn't have actually dropped. It's a constant.
662000	668000	So, oh, well then, how do you explain the fact everyone was finding it going much slower during that period?
668000	673000	Is it because they were fudging their results to get what they thought other people should be getting,
673000	677000	and the whole thing was just produced by, in the minds of physicists?
677000	680000	He said, we don't like to use the word fudge.
680000	682000	I said, well, what do you prefer?
682000	686000	He said, well, we prefer to call it intellectual phase locking.
686000	696000	So I said, well, if it was going on then, how can we be so sure it's not going on today?
696000	700000	And that the present values are produced by intellectual phase locking.
700000	702000	And he said, oh, we know that's not the case.
702000	703000	I said, how do we know?
703000	706000	He said, well, we've solved the problem.
706000	707000	And I said, well, how?
707000	712000	He said, well, we fixed the speed of light by definition in 1972.
712000	714000	So I said, but it might still change.
714000	718000	He said, yes, but we'd never know it because we've defined the meter in terms of the speed of light.
718000	720000	So the units had changed with it.
720000	722000	So he looked very pleased about that.
722000	726000	They'd fixed that problem.
726000	733000	But I said, well, then what about big G, the gravitational constant known in the trade as big G is written with a capital G,
733000	736000	Newton's universal gravitational constant.
736000	740000	That's varied by more than 1.3% in recent years.
740000	744000	And it seems to vary from place to place and from time to time.
744000	746000	And he said, oh, well, those are just errors.
746000	750000	And unfortunately, there are quite big errors with big G.
750000	752000	So I said, well, what if it's really changing?
752000	754000	I mean, perhaps it is really changing.
754000	756000	And then I looked at how they do it.
756000	758000	What happens is they measure it in different labs.
758000	760000	They get different values on different days.
760000	762000	And then they average them.
762000	764000	And then other labs around the world do the same.
764000	766000	And they come out usually with a rather different average.
766000	770000	And then the International Committee on Metrology meets every 10 years or so
770000	774000	and average the ones from labs around the world to come up with the value of big G.
774000	778000	But what if G were actually fluctuating?
778000	780000	What if it changed?
780000	784000	There's already evidence, actually, that it changes throughout the day and throughout the year.
784000	787000	What if the Earth, as it moves through the galactic environment,
787000	792000	went through patches of dark matter or other environmental factors that could alter it?
792000	794000	Maybe they all change together.
794000	797000	What if these errors are going up together and down together?
797000	802000	For more than 10 years, I've been trying to persuade metrologists to look at the raw data.
802000	805000	In fact, I'm now trying to persuade them to put it online, on the internet,
805000	809000	with the dates and the actual measurements, and see if they're correlated,
809000	812000	to see if they're all up at one time, all down at another.
812000	814000	If so, they might be fluctuating together.
814000	816000	And that would tell us something very, very interesting.
816000	818000	But no one has done this.
818000	820000	They haven't done it because G is a constant.
820000	822000	There's no point looking for changes.
822000	828000	You see, here's a very simple example of where a dogmatic assumption actually inhibits inquiry.
828000	832000	I, myself, think that the constants may vary quite considerably,
832000	835000	well, within narrow limits, but they may all be varying.
835000	838000	And I think the day will come when scientific journals, like Nature,
838000	842000	have a weekly report on the constants, like stock market reports and newspapers.
842000	845000	This week, Big G was slightly up.
845000	847000	The charge on the electron was down.
847000	850000	The speed of light held steady and so on.
851000	859000	That's one area, just one area where I think thinking less dogmatically could open things up.
859000	862000	One of the biggest areas is the nature of the mind.
862000	868000	This is the most unsolved problem that science simply can't deal with the fact we're conscious.
868000	874000	And it can't deal with the fact that our thoughts don't seem to be inside our brains.
874000	878000	Our experiences don't all seem to be inside our brain.
878000	882000	Your image of me now doesn't seem to be inside your brain,
882000	885000	yet the official view is there's a little rupert somewhere inside your head.
885000	888000	And everything else in this room is inside your head.
888000	890000	Your experience is inside your brain.
890000	895000	I'm suggesting, actually, that vision involves an outward projection of images.
895000	897000	What you're seeing is in your mind, but not inside your head.
897000	902000	Our minds are extended beyond our brains in the simplest act of perception.
902000	905000	I think that we project out the images we're seeing.
905000	909000	And these images touch what we're looking at.
909000	911000	If I look at you from behind, you don't know I'm there.
911000	913000	Could I affect you?
913000	915000	Could you feel my gaze?
915000	917000	There's a great deal of evidence that people can.
917000	920000	The sense of being stared at is an extremely common experience.
920000	924000	And recent experimental research suggests it's real.
924000	926000	Animals seem to have it too.
926000	930000	I think it probably evolved in the context of predator-prey relationships.
930000	934000	Prey animals that could feel the gaze of a predator would survive better than those that couldn't.
934000	938000	This would lead to a whole new way of thinking about ecological relationships
938000	942000	between predators and prey, also about the extent of our minds.
942000	947000	If we look at distant stars, I think our minds reach out in a sense to touch those stars
947000	951000	and literally extend out over astronomical distances.
951000	954000	They're not just inside our heads.
954000	958000	Now, it may seem astonishing that this is a topic of debate in the 21st century.
958000	962000	We know so little about our own minds that where our images are
962000	967000	is a hot topic of debate within consciousness studies right now.
967000	970000	I don't have time to deal with any more of these dogmas,
970000	972000	but every single one of them is questionable.
972000	977000	If one questions it, new forms of research, new possibilities open up.
977000	981000	And I think as we question these dogmas that have held back science so long,
981000	985000	science will undergo a reflaring, a renaissance.
985000	987000	I'm a total believer in the importance of science.
987000	991000	I've spent my whole life as a research scientist, my whole career.
991000	995000	But I think by moving beyond these dogmas, it can be regenerated.
995000	999000	Once again, it can become interesting and I hope life affirming.
999000	1001000	Thank you.
1021000	1023000	Thank you.
1051000	1053000	Thank you.
