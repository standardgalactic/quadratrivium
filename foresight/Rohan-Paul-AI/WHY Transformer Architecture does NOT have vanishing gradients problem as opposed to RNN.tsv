0	5680	Why transformer architecture does not have vanishing gradients problem as opposed to
5680	8920	recurrent neural network or RNN?
8920	13880	The simple answer is that in the transformer architecture at every layer, you still have
13880	20800	access to all the input tokens, which is in stark contrast to any RNN where each token
20800	22880	is processed one by one.
22880	25280	Let's look at few more points.
25280	29680	In the transformer, due to the self-attention mechanism, every token in a sequence has
29680	35880	the potential to directly attend to every other token irrespective of their relative
35880	36880	position.
36880	43800	This means that the information flow between distant tokens is not constrained by the sequential
43800	47000	processing nature seen in RNN.
47000	53360	So RNNNs, that is recurrent neural network, inherently process sequences in a step-by-step
53360	54360	manner.
54360	61400	This means that to relay information from an early token to a later position, the information
61400	65080	must be propagated through every intermediate step.
65080	70120	This can potentially lead to vanishing or even exploding gradients, especially for long
70120	77440	sequences, as a gradient signal might diminish or explode as it's back propagated through
77440	78440	the time.
78440	84240	Now, the direct connection between all tokens in the transformer ensured that there is
84240	91680	no need to go through potentially many intermediate steps as with RNN for the gradient to flow
91680	94520	from one token's position to another.
94520	101320	This architecture design allows for more direct gradient pathways during back propagation.
101320	107600	Additionally, residual connections in transformers further alleviate the vanishing gradient problem.
107600	113560	These connections ensure that the gradient can flow unimpeded through the network by
113560	115880	passing certain layers if necessary.
115880	121680	It's also important to note that the normalization techniques like layer normalization employed
121680	126120	in transformer models further stabilizes the training process.
126120	132720	Stable activations reduce the risk of gradients becoming too small or too large.
132720	137360	The sliding window attention in transformer networks have vanishing gradient problems.
137360	142040	To answer simply, sliding window attention in transformers is designed to mitigate the
142040	148920	vanishing gradient problem by constraining the scope of attention within each window.
148920	154320	This approach limits the paths through which gradients must propagate, reducing the likelihood
154320	158400	of vanishing gradients compared to full sequence attention mechanism.
158400	164400	Now, sliding window attention is a mechanism designed to improve the efficiency of transformer
164400	170240	models, particularly when dealing with long sequences, by restricting attention to a fixed
170240	173480	size window around each position.
173480	179880	It reduces the quadratic computational complexity associated with standard self-attention.
179880	185920	The vanishing gradient problem is difficulty that arises during training of deep neural
185920	186920	networks.
186920	193440	It refers to gradients becoming too small for earlier layers during propagation, that
193440	197280	is, back propagation, leading to insufficient learning.
197280	203760	The consequence is that weights in the early layers of the network barely change, making
203760	211420	it difficult or impossible for model to learn from its input data and thereby the weights
211420	215000	update mechanism breaks down.
215000	219760	Now let's quickly think about if sliding window attention has the vanishing gradient
219760	220760	problem.
220760	227240	Though the use of sliding window attention by itself does not inherently introduce the
227240	233000	vanishing gradient problem, the primary purpose of SWA, that is, sliding window attention,
233000	235000	is to reduce computational complexity.
235000	241160	However, the depth of the network and the activation functions used are the primary
241160	245200	factors influencing the vanishing gradient problem.
245200	249840	Transformers, due to their architecture, are generally less prone to vanishing gradient
249840	256480	problem compared to traditional deep RNN, that is, recurrent neural networks, or LSTM,
256480	259920	that is, long and short term network.
259920	264800	And this is mainly because transformers use multi-head attention and skip connections,
264800	266680	that is, residual connections.
266680	271160	And these connections allow gradients to flow more freely through the network.
