1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,680
We're live. Oh, okay. Good. That's fine. All right, everybody. Welcome to another episode of the Break the Rules live stream

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,780
I'm your host, Lev Polyakov, and we are here today

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,400
again with Dr.

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,520
Jason Reza Giorgiani

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,000
PhD it is a great honor as always to have you here my friend

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:26,780
We are going to be talking about your latest book Philosophy of the Future as well as talking about what's currently going on within the

7
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,260
political realm and I'm sure that there is a way that we can

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,320
Bring those two things together because I personally think that they are very much

9
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,220
Interrelated and of course if you guys have not read the Dr.

10
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,980
Giorgiani's books yet first of all I highly recommend you go into the description right now and

11
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:49,460
Get yourself a copy of the latest book as well as look at Prometheus and Atlas lovers of Sophia

12
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:54,460
So so many different books Iranian Leviathan the list goes up Prometheism

13
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,460
So you are going to be

14
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:03,940
Extremely pleased if this is your first time ever discovering Dr. Giorgiani and his wonderful work and

15
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,420
With that I first want to ask

16
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,340
Dr. Giorgiani about the Prometheus

17
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,700
Titan project however things go in with that

18
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:18,100
So please let us know and once again like comment subscribe

19
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:23,940
Super chat ten dollars minimum today and let's go for it. Dr. Giorgiani. You've got the floor

20
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,460
It's a pleasure to be on your show again Lev as always

21
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,100
So last time I think it was the last time that I was on BTR

22
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:39,300
I introduced the American Colossus project to build a monument to Prometheus on Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay and

23
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,820
We talked about the sculpture in general terms and we also went into

24
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:50,900
What I described as an NFT project at that point really it's not an NFT project

25
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:59,380
It's more like a digital raffle that will use NFT technology and that's going to involve a nationwide treasure hunt with clues embedded in these in these

26
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,700
Raffles and with very compelling

27
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,380
Aesthetic imagery and so on and so forth

28
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:11,740
So we discussed that a bit last time. I wanted to give viewers some updates regarding the Colossus project

29
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,580
Some rather significant updates

30
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:20,460
We are really moving we're working hard and moving at breakneck speed here on this project

31
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:25,180
It's definitely moving forward. We have found a sculptor

32
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,020
Fantastic sculptor who is an uber Nietzschean

33
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:37,220
Promethean in the spirit of his work and I think I had mentioned last time I was on that the kind of

34
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:45,020
Fash wave Greco-Roman type sculptures that you see as 3d renderings that are on the website of americancolossus.org

35
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:52,100
Right now that they're really placeholders and that the sculpture itself will be more sophisticated in terms of its aesthetics

36
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,300
I think I did touch on that well

37
00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:01,180
You can get a much clearer sense of that now because our sculptor will be a gentleman by the name of fen de Villiers

38
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,140
And you can go to his website a fen de Villiers

39
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,940
and

40
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,780
he

41
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,100
has a fascinating idea of

42
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:17,300
Retracing the history of Western aesthetics within the context of an overarching style of modernism

43
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:22,580
So in a lot of the works that he has up on his website right now and his current sculpture portfolio

44
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:26,800
You can see projects that have a kind of archaic aesthetic

45
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,580
reiterated within the context of modernism

46
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:35,740
But as I understand it fen is interested in moving now more toward exploring classicism

47
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,740
But again within the context of modernism

48
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:46,540
So probably the sculpture that winds up being erected on Alcatraz will have somewhat of an art deco feel to it a kind of

49
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,780
classical modernist

50
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,780
Archeo-futuristic hybrid

51
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,700
that you know

52
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,940
One saw some examples of during the zenith of the art deco era

53
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,740
And I think that's very

54
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,540
Consonant with the spirit of Prometheus

55
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,220
Because there's a kind of you know renaissance

56
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,260
fusion of

57
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:15,180
Art qua craft with craft qua technology in that aesthetic in particular

58
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,780
It's also a very American aesthetic if you ask me

59
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:21,020
I mean some of the greatest American cities New York included of course

60
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,700
were predominantly built in the art deco style and you know

61
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:30,900
That was the historical moment when America wound up becoming the leading nation on the planet

62
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,060
So

63
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,060
I think that's a very positive development

64
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,300
And if you're going to listen to some of fen's interviews with various podcasters

65
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,620
You can see that

66
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,620
In terms of his worldview

67
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:48,820
He is the perfect man for the job. He actually has his own manifesto his own aesthetic manifesto

68
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,500
And I think in a lot of ways it dovetails with

69
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,500
With our own vision with the vision of Prometheus. I'm certainly

70
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,100
It's that's one. Yeah, it's a very interesting that

71
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,260
Fen is being a part of this

72
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,620
I remember first reading about him in men's world magazine

73
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,780
And I do see there being a convergence as well as a divergence

74
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:16,900
Apart as far as what you're doing and what let's say, you know bronze age pervert and people like that have been up to

75
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:24,260
Yes, well, look, there is a certain atmosphere which we will we will come around to discussing today, right?

76
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:29,700
A certain atmosphere that's been created by the left, which has gone full retard

77
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,340
and

78
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:37,940
that's going to necessitate a reaction to a certain extent and you know, what

79
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,140
What is necessary in order to?

80
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,580
Regain our footing and

81
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,900
Prevent a civilizational collapse

82
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:51,780
Maybe somewhat different from what I would believe to be ideal

83
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,420
But we're never going to get to any kind of an ideal

84
00:05:54,820 --> 00:06:01,780
Promethean society as I might envision it if our civilization is is taken under by these leftists and social justice warriors

85
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:05,940
so there is a kind of a degree of reaction that's necessary and

86
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:13,300
You know for many reasons I think you know fend is certainly the right man for the job and and it's a positive thing that you know his

87
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,740
That he has connections with those circles

88
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:22,420
Because we are going to need to solicit their support and we need as broad a coalition as possible

89
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,140
to stand a chance in

90
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,340
you know, basically not just saving but but

91
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,500
but

92
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,500
resuscitating our civilization and

93
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:39,940
Kindling a second renaissance of the west. So that's a very positive development for the classes project, but there's another

94
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:45,140
Development that in some ways I see as equally positive and that's that

95
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,060
We are going to make a tv series

96
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,180
That traces the making of the colossus

97
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,620
And it's going to involve stunning visuals

98
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,940
initially 3d renderings but ultimately a tracing of the

99
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,180
process that leads to the construction of the colossus itself

100
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,580
And we found the perfect director for this tv series

101
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,740
It's a it's a series that

102
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,780
Through this director and the work that she's done

103
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:19,940
Will likely also have very significant high-level distribution and while I can't reveal, you know

104
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:25,700
The name of this person as of yet. I can say that

105
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,860
She is absolutely the perfect director for the project

106
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,300
really strong sharp woman who

107
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,580
shares a lot of our vision and

108
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:41,700
Who frankly is just a really cool person who I look forward to working with over the coming years

109
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:47,940
And I also think that it's great to you know, finally have a woman in a prominent place in this project

110
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,740
Do you see her in a way as being your uh,

111
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,060
Promethea if you will

112
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:57,860
Well, I don't know that, you know, she I don't know that she would want to be put in any such a position, but she's certainly

113
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,740
uh a more than competent director with a

114
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,980
deeply shared

115
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,980
vision and orientation

116
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,100
and

117
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,540
A person who I think it's going to be an absolute pleasure to work with over the coming years

118
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:17,380
And I will be working closely with her because she's going to basically trace the entire process and make a historical record

119
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,700
So, uh, I was uh reading and I finished your amazing latest book philosophy of the future

120
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:31,220
And what I noticed is that it did require me to have a certain bits of knowledge from all the other books that you've read

121
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,420
In order to in a way try and complete the puzzle

122
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,940
That is your latest one because you throw a lot of references

123
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:41,860
Not that people need to specifically read all your other books to enjoy this one

124
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:47,700
But it definitely helps to be well acquainted with what happened in the past as far as certain questions that I

125
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,180
always had in my mind as far as

126
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,100
in Iranian leviathan, whether it was the

127
00:08:55,140 --> 00:09:02,180
um, uh, the persians, uh, the dynasty that created islam or whether it was these nephilim

128
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,780
Like that is a very interesting thing for me to, uh,

129
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:13,300
Digest as far as what exactly is the truth where you are playing the role of the trickster

130
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:18,340
And how exactly that's going to lead to the conclusions that you wanted to lead to

131
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,900
I don't know if that's a good place to start

132
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,900
But uh, let me know like where exactly you would be interested in

133
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,500
In a way, frankly, I'd say it's not a good place to start

134
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:33,940
I'd say it's kind of getting lost in the weeds and I would want to push back a little bit on your general characterization because

135
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:40,020
Yeah, you're right that in terms of some very specific questions like what you just articulated

136
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,980
It's helpful to have read some of my other works

137
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,580
but

138
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:49,700
That's not the main objective of philosophy of the future philosophy of the future has as its aim

139
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,540
a

140
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:57,140
general introduction of the reader to the fundamental concepts of my philosophical project

141
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:02,100
Or it can be read as a summary conclusion of my philosophical project

142
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:08,900
But in any case, what's most important about this book are the central ideas ideas novel ideas that i've developed

143
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:14,820
Like being bound for freedom spectral revolution world state of emergency phenomenal authorization

144
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:19,940
Uh and aero sophia. These are you know the the core of the book

145
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,740
In terms of specific

146
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:30,340
Theses that i've argued in various texts. Yeah, there are brief references to them here

147
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:35,460
And they're and the reader is also directed to the other books of mine where these

148
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:42,340
Theses are advanced with more detailed argumentation. So actually the book also functions as a kind of

149
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,540
Uh, like index or lexicon

150
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,540
For my entire corpus where in any given chapter

151
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:55,140
There are references to other books that i've written if the reader wants more detailed information

152
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,260
Regarding, you know, such and such an argument or thesis

153
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:05,860
But it's the conceptual structure of my philosophical work as a whole that's being really showcased by this book

154
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:12,260
Albeit, I also have to add that there is a rather striking conclusion to this book the last chapter

155
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,820
um is a very

156
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,140
dangerously revealing

157
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,740
document which

158
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,420
includes some

159
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,420
lengthy quotations from a

160
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,700
Journal that I wrote around about the age of

161
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,580
23 24

162
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:33,540
And it shows you the matrix for my entire philosophical project

163
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,740
And what what it is or who it is that really inspired it

164
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:48,420
As far as a phenomenal authorization goes that is what i'm primarily talking about when it comes to these various references to

165
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:53,860
You having certain let's say mixes of truths with noble lies

166
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:59,460
And i'm still trying to understand how exactly this phenomenal authorization would work

167
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,380
Uh, could you possibly guide us through that?

168
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:08,660
Sure, look the basic idea because I want to stay here with with you know, uh

169
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:14,340
Large structures and and you know general, you know themes here

170
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:18,020
Uh, the basic idea behind phenomenal authorization

171
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:23,620
Develop certain threads from out of the philosophical work of Nietzsche

172
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,100
Heidegger

173
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,100
Wittgenstein

174
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,860
Um, I'd say those are the primary ones also to an extent

175
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:39,860
Also to an extent it develops certain notions in the work of charles fort fort who was not a philosopher, but who had some very interesting

176
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:46,420
Epistemological ideas in the course of his study of the paranormal in the early 20th century

177
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:51,620
And and and to a lesser extent, you know the the philosophy of science of thomas kuhn

178
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,580
And of paul fair robin is also relevant here

179
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,140
But mainly coming from out of Nietzsche

180
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,860
Heidegger and wittgenstein

181
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,860
The idea is this

182
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:08,820
The and and by the way, heraclitus was incredibly important both to Nietzsche and to uh heidegger

183
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:12,020
And I would say that the ontology and and uh

184
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,580
And germinal epistemology of heraclitus is also very much in the background here, right?

185
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,980
So the idea is this that

186
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:26,100
The modern representationalist conception of truth in other words truth as veritas

187
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:32,100
Where there's an objectively existent structure of reality out there and that

188
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,660
What it means to ascertain knowledge meaning truths about things

189
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:42,420
Is for us to be able to construct the representational statements in our consciousness

190
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,900
That propositionally refer

191
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:54,020
To states of affairs in the world and are either accurate representations of those states of affairs or are inaccurate meaning their false propositions

192
00:13:54,420 --> 00:14:01,140
Right, that's the basic conception of truth that began to be developed in the epoch of Descartes

193
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:07,300
Uh in large part, um as a consequence of the of Descartes dualistic ontology

194
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:14,980
and it ultimately culminated in uh the representational symbolic logic of like vietnam russell

195
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,460
and the early ludwig vittgenstein

196
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,940
and vittgenstein

197
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:27,860
Infamously deconstructed that having been the paragon of it himself in the tractatus logical philosophicus

198
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,780
vittgenstein turned on that whole school including his mentor russell

199
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:37,940
And he deconstructed this representationalist conception of truth in ways that oddly enough

200
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,580
Completely converged with heidegger's

201
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,340
Hermeneutics because these guys had no connection with each other whatsoever

202
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:48,020
They come from completely different trajectories in the history of philosophy

203
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:52,180
And yet they converge and how do they converge? Well, they both wind up saying that

204
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:59,540
Our phenomenological experience of the world in other words the way in which we experience phenomena

205
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,300
And the way in which the world has any meaning for us

206
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,260
Is a function of language

207
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:12,180
So it's not that there's any objective reality outside our minds and that our minds

208
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:16,340
ascertain truth by adequately reflecting an objective reality

209
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:22,420
It's that our subjectivity and what we take to be the objectivity of the world

210
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,140
our relative phenomena

211
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:31,620
Constructed deconstructed and reconstructed from out of how we use language

212
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:38,420
And when they're talking about language in this case, they mean it in the ancient greek sense of logos in other words

213
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,820
there is a tapestry of meaning

214
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:46,180
That is primordial in terms of our experience of phenomena in the world

215
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:52,420
And it's through this logos that chaos becomes cosmos

216
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,300
so the chaos that that

217
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:00,920
The chaos that proceeds our consciously processed experience

218
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,940
Becomes a structured array namely a cosmos

219
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,220
through logos

220
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,060
And in this relation between these three terms

221
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:19,460
chaos and cosmos cosmos coming to be through chaos being processed by logos

222
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,700
There's also a fourth term which is psyche

223
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,260
in other words

224
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:27,780
Consciousness has integral to that process which we see in quantum physics

225
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,420
and so in an interesting way

226
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:35,860
What verner heisenberg pointed to in his book physics and philosophy

227
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:40,420
Which is one of the great, you know texts and I guess what you could call philosophy of physics

228
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,900
What heisenberg

229
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,980
Hitler's nuclear scientist

230
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:53,060
Points out in that book about quantum theory in terms of the integral role of consciousness

231
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,460
In constituting a structured

232
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:00,980
World from out of the chaos that is superposition on a quantum scale

233
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,820
and

234
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:10,340
Which which heisenberg explicitly discusses in that text with reference back to heraclitus and heraclitus is conception of logos

235
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,220
All of that is already implicit

236
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:19,780
In the ontology and epistemology that heidegger was developing and that bickenstein oddly enough also wound up

237
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:27,300
Arriving at by a completely different trajectory. And so i'm taking these ideas and synthesizing them and augmenting them

238
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,460
and

239
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,460
using the paranormal

240
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,820
as

241
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,660
an empirical

242
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,660
Let's say raw material

243
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,980
or convenient set of examples

244
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,220
to illustrate

245
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,420
why

246
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:49,380
The world works this way. I'm being very careful not to say why why reality, you know is this way because the whole point is that

247
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,620
What we take to be reality

248
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,380
objectively

249
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:59,460
And how we understand ourselves subjectively are co-constructed from out of this interrelationship

250
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,060
between

251
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,100
chaos

252
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,900
logos cosmos and psyche i

253
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,460
describe these four as

254
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,260
ontologically equa primordial

255
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:15,700
It's a term coming from heidegger equally primordial meaning like the four causes in Aristotle

256
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:21,220
None of these is more fundamental than the other they represent the kind of fourfold causality

257
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,500
That structures our experience of the world and so okay, so that's the basis

258
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,780
for understanding what phenomenal authorization is because

259
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,500
What that implies

260
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,940
is that

261
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,940
We live in something like a story

262
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,940
We live in a tapestry of meaning in an account a narrative

263
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,140
There is a metanarrative structure to the cosmos itself

264
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,980
And what that suggests is that the world can be written and rewritten

265
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:52,420
And if you look at some of the more bizarre and distressing

266
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:57,140
Paranormal phenomena that seem to involve the manipulation of timelines

267
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:00,420
Or the use of some kind of time travel technology, whether it's

268
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:05,620
purely mechanical or whether it's actually psychical like remote viewers

269
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:11,300
Going back to the past and using telekinesis to influence past events to therefore rewrite

270
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:16,900
Their presence the present that they came from right or to rewrite potential futures

271
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:22,420
Whether it's entirely mechanical technology or whether it's psychical or whether it's some psychotronic combination thereof

272
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,260
When you look at these kinds of things that are possible

273
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,780
You realize that we live in a revisible world

274
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:35,620
And it's rewritable the way that the story is rewritable now the thing though is that not everybody's an author

275
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,780
And not all authors have that kind of purchase on

276
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:45,460
Defining what reality is not just for themselves, but for our whole society

277
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:50,820
And so I developed this notion of people who are phenomenally authorized meaning

278
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,660
Um

279
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:58,500
At the diametric opposite pole of what we what we would call these days an npc a non-player character

280
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:04,260
In a kind of simulacrum in a in a theatrical space in a in a game space

281
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,900
On the opposite pole of of those people who are kind of like part of the

282
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,860
What they're the wallpaper or window dressing

283
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:16,340
You have people whose agency is such that they are actually

284
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:20,740
Engaged in defining what reality is for whole society

285
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,420
through their

286
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:28,900
Creative endeavors whether it's literal writing or whether it's logos in the form of artistic production or

287
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,180
You know cinema or music and and so on and so forth

288
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:36,500
So you have this idea that there's a relationship between

289
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:43,700
Authorship again including in all the arts all the modes of of poesis or creative production

290
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:48,260
Authorship in that sense is related to phenomena

291
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,900
So phenomena are

292
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,180
phenomenally authorized by these author

293
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,740
types

294
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:01,620
But then there's also a kind of authority that that represents which I argue

295
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:08,420
Far exceeds political authority or you could say is more fundamental than political authority

296
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:15,060
Where the political leaders of one or another country are relatively insignificant

297
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:22,180
Compared to the movers and shakers who define the welton shong the worldview of that

298
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:27,940
Culture who set the standard for what's even going to count as real or unreal

299
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,460
You know for a given people which as you mentioned in your book

300
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:38,500
Nowadays unfortunately is uh in the power of all of these social media gossipers

301
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:43,780
Who back in the day would have just been relegated to gossiping in the back of the church during sunday

302
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:49,860
And now they're the ones that seem to wheel the power and bring people into the lowest common denominator

303
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,460
So

304
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:57,700
I don't know if now would be a good time to talk about what that future holds because i'm still very intrigued by

305
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:02,980
What the possibilities are here of wielding this kind of authority and authorship

306
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,260
So whichever direction you would prefer to go to please let me know

307
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,780
Well, I think that you know, it's fair to say

308
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:19,700
That my philosophical project as a whole which is reflected in a really condensed and crystallized form in this book philosophy of the future

309
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:29,620
Uh owes a great deal to nichea and and where nichea did not serve as an explicit inspiration

310
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:34,180
it's consonant with a lot of what nichea was doing and and um

311
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:41,940
Uh represents a further development of the same trajectory of thought that nichea was pursuing

312
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:49,860
And nichea had this vision of what he called frankly artist tyrants or artist philosophers

313
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,300
Uh who would wind up defining

314
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:59,460
Life on this earth in terms that exceeded the limits of the human condition

315
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,340
these are his uber mention

316
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,860
and

317
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:10,180
He has this notion that you know, there are these the highest men of history who are great geniuses and that basically

318
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,980
historical development throughout

319
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:18,260
Throughout time should be seen in terms of these mountain peaks

320
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,660
that are each

321
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:27,220
The contributions of one or another genius and that these higher men are progenitors of the coming overmen

322
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,860
just as

323
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,940
just as the last men

324
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:35,380
Uh who are increasingly degenerate

325
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,580
lazy

326
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:43,860
People who are feckless and without any particular motivation people who become

327
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:47,540
Ultimately captured by the event horizon of nihilism

328
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:52,260
that these uh last men are the harbingers of

329
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,620
A race of untermention

330
00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:01,780
Subhumans who are really no longer going to be human and we're going to wind up being integrated into a machinery of

331
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:07,140
Reduction nichea has this vision as any today when you think in terms of the pace at which

332
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,100
Developments are taking place in artificial intelligence

333
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:16,260
And I mean, I don't know if you've seen what gpt 4o can do, but it's actually unsettling

334
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,580
uh, so

335
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:23,620
Even for me who's written about this for years like the rate at which this is happening is astonishing

336
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:26,100
Well, it was showing your your past as well

337
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,700
Uh possible past. I mean when you were uh using it

338
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,300
Yeah, well, we can come to that too. I mean so

339
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:41,700
But then when you combine ai with gene editing like for example, there are stories coming out today about how

340
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:50,980
One of the biggest problems with genetic engineering throughout these years that it's that it's been uh worked on by various companies is that

341
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,900
A lot of genes have secondary and tertiary functions

342
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,820
which if you

343
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,100
tinker with

344
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:02,260
The primary function of the gene that it is you're trying to manipulate in a person's genome

345
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:06,740
You wind up shutting off, you know some secondary or tertiary function

346
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:12,500
You don't understand well and that's going to become a problem for the organism. It could even be potentially lethal

347
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:19,140
So it requires extremely complex mapping of the multiple functions of any particular gene

348
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:25,380
It's been very difficult for us to do that which has meant that hitherto genetic engineering has been very dangerous

349
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:32,820
Well ai has cracked it ai has now mapped all of the secondary tertiary whatever functions of every gene

350
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,980
And it can do an analysis of exactly, you know

351
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:42,820
What benefit and what risks there are to making a particular edit in the genome using crisper?

352
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:48,500
So these technologies are becoming increasingly convergent in ways where you could see how

353
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,020
the vast majority of

354
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,900
You know people without any particular will or motivation

355
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,700
aspiration without any

356
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:04,980
Capacity to think for themselves or to pursue visions in a self-directed way

357
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,540
they're just going to wind up

358
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:11,700
being integrated into a machinery of production and

359
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:17,060
At the very best at the very best through cybernetic technology

360
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,300
and

361
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,300
they're going to wind up serving

362
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,780
the purposes of a group of

363
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:29,700
As Nietzsche put it spiritual aristocrats who are renaissance men in the truest sense

364
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,260
renaissance men and women

365
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,340
who

366
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:41,700
Are visionaries who are geniuses who who have more ideas than they know what to do with and who will take these emerging technology

367
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:46,340
First of all, they'll augment themselves biologically, but then also use artificial intelligence

368
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,300
to actualize

369
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,540
astonishing visions that

370
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:56,500
Have hitherto been deemed impossible. They're going to make the impossible possible

371
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:01,320
using these singularity level technologies and that's phenomenal authorization

372
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,260
okay, but

373
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,140
You know, if we just look at the state of the world today

374
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:13,780
I think it's fair to say that that phenomenal phenomenal authorization is not going to extend to the general population. It's it's going to be

375
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:22,580
A phenomenally authorized group of individuals who fight fight for their autonomy and for their creative power and genius

376
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:27,140
You don't really see the possibility like you were talking about with zero point energy

377
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:33,700
Being able to be in anybody's backyard this same kind of AI technology where you could press a button

378
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,420
All of a sudden you're bigger faster smarter

379
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:39,700
You know, you become the uber mensch even though you start out as the intermensch

380
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:43,220
You don't really see the npc people as you were calling them

381
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,980
embrace that here's the issue left the issue is

382
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,500
That in some totally

383
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:54,340
unhistorical abstract hypothetical scenario

384
00:27:54,900 --> 00:28:00,500
Where we didn't have all the ideological baggage that we have in the world that would be entirely possible

385
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:07,380
However, as we'll get around to discussing by the end of this conversation, you know in terms of what's going on domestically

386
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,100
and geopolitically

387
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:14,660
The number of retards who are subscribing to

388
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,220
traditionalist

389
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:21,780
regressive ideologies in the world today or to forms of leftism

390
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:25,540
That are so nihilistic and cynical that they're actually dialectically

391
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:34,180
Empowering these various forms of retardation is such that the vast majority of the world population has foreclosed its participation

392
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,940
in such a process

393
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,940
We are 10 to 20 years away

394
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:43,380
At one point I thought we were 30 years away from the singularity the rate at which AI technology is developing today

395
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:47,220
I can tell you I I don't think we're more than 10 to 15 years away from the singularity

396
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:52,100
And we just don't have any time left for these people. We don't have the time left

397
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,460
When you have a vast majority of people

398
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:00,980
Look, Islam is going to be the dominant religion on this planet by 2075

399
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,620
If current demographic trends continue

400
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:06,180
Right and then we've got

401
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,140
The russian orthodox

402
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,380
Through people like dugin

403
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,100
aligned with these islamic traditionalists

404
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:19,460
And then we have china financing both of them and militarily backing them

405
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:25,300
Right. I mean i'll come to this later. Yeah, it was it was discovered recently by an independent think tank

406
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:34,100
that the worst of the pro palestine protests in america where they were actually targeting infrastructure blocking roads and

407
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:41,700
Bridges and taking over university campuses. Those were funded by china through a series of false front organizations

408
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:47,620
So you've got the chinese behind these muslims and you've got the russian orthodox

409
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:52,900
Power cabal of putin and dugin also supporting them

410
00:29:53,380 --> 00:30:01,460
Right and then all the leftists in europe and america the socialist parties in europe and the sjw's in the united states

411
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:06,420
Are also they're literally in some cases converting to islam on these university

412
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,780
Uh, palestine encampments, right? That's that's on the left and on the right

413
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:16,340
You've got people like andrew tate who's also converting young men into islam because they're very dissatisfied with the way things are going now

414
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:20,580
In europe and then in america. We have the the retards of the bible belt

415
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,460
Yeah

416
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:29,700
Well, there is this new movement right now. I'm sure you've heard about you know, like the uh, jesus's uh, jesus's king jesus's lord

417
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,020
it's their way of

418
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,500
reaffirming this much more of a warrior

419
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:41,380
type christianity as opposed to like the soft christianity that i'm not a big fan of either as far as you know, like the

420
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:45,700
sjw type christians that i'm sure you've seen a lot of in minhatten

421
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:51,860
Yeah, well, they're you know, just because there are nods with one another doesn't make either of them our allies

422
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:57,780
They're both enemies. They're both mortal enemies and look when you have people like steve bannon even steve bannon

423
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:01,860
Coming out and arguing that server farms should be bombed by the us air force

424
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:08,500
Then you know, what hope is there that any of these christians in the bible belt are going to

425
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:15,460
Support our continued advancement toward the technological singularity or availed themselves of the opportunity to use this technology

426
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:19,620
In order to become ubermanshin, right? I mean no that's not going to happen

427
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:24,820
They're going to band together with the russian orthodox and in some cases they're even going to band together with the moslems

428
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:31,380
In order to lead some luddite traditionalist rebellion against the advent of the singularity

429
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,060
well

430
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,940
But uh going back to how exactly this

431
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:40,340
There's some noise from the outside here. Give me one second. Sure, absolutely

432
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:44,820
Yes, so that we don't wind up with any disruption. I'll be right back sounds good

433
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:50,980
And uh while jason is away. I just want to remind everybody here if this is your first time watching break the rules

434
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,540
Be sure to like subscribe comment

435
00:31:53,780 --> 00:32:00,660
But also check out the other videos because I have videos with thinkers like kurdus yarvin mensius moldbug

436
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:04,820
Uh jason reservoir johnny as you can see over here uber boyo

437
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:10,980
uh neil nostic informant all kinds of an amazing uh sticks hexan hammer 666

438
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:15,220
uh britney venti who uh hopefully should be coming back soon as well

439
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,420
So i'm also doing right now these uh

440
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:24,900
presentations these streams in uh my Manhattan studio in new york city

441
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:30,980
And what i'm planning on doing is that if you guys become patrons patreon.com slash break the rules

442
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:37,540
And if you become specifically 20 dollar patrons and you guys happen to live within the new york sydney vicinity

443
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:41,460
Then you know after making sure everything is kosher, you know

444
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:47,860
Just so we don't have people from mental institutions coming in then i would definitely love to invite you guys over to these

445
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,020
taped

446
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:53,860
Uh recordings with uh the various interesting guests including dr.

447
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:57,380
Giorgiani that i'm going to be having in the coming months

448
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:04,740
So once again patreon.com slash break the rules go there right now and uh you guys are going to get a lot of good stuff

449
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:11,620
Even uh if you're not in new york city, you're going to get exclusive episodes including a q&a with georgiorgiani

450
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:17,860
Which you guys could watch uh right now once again, that's patreon.com slash break the rules

451
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:26,180
Go there or be square. Anyway, uh jason we are back over here and uh, yeah, let's uh, let's keep uh, let's keep going

452
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,860
So as far as

453
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:34,260
What exactly are the limitations to changing and i know you don't like using the word reality

454
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:39,700
But if we're talking about overcoming the situation we're in right now with this philosophy of the future

455
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:46,420
We still have to know what the certain limitations are obviously right now. I'm not going to be able to just go through a wall

456
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:49,540
I'm not going to be able to teleport myself back in time

457
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:53,780
But what are the things that people are able to use?

458
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,340
Right here and right now

459
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:01,300
In order to change things things that may go beyond just i don't know just being uh

460
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:07,940
Interesting thinker and philosopher and spreading messages because obviously, you know, we all know that we can do that

461
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:11,700
But as far as going beyond that what exactly is there?

462
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:18,100
Well, let me be very practical with you. Okay, um, and also I have to say that

463
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:23,860
You have to make a caveat there in terms of what you mean by people people can you know, what can people do?

464
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,860
Like most people are utterly oblivious

465
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:32,180
Uh and or captivated by one of these aforementioned ideologies that are that are responsible for destroying our civilization

466
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:37,700
And so most people are not going to you know, take the initiative to do to use any

467
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:42,100
Uh extraordinary abilities to potentially

468
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,060
Make us uh make us uh

469
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:52,100
Uh to potentially make a better future than the one that we're headed for right now, right?

470
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,940
But what can people with with initiative do? Well

471
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:02,580
Look, this is a bit of a dangerous game, but remote viewing the future for example is a

472
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:06,900
Imminently possible thing. It's been done many times

473
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,420
And so there's a case to be made

474
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:18,420
For training oneself in remote viewing to the point that one could look around the corner

475
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:24,580
And and see some of the challenges and crises that we're going to be facing in the near future

476
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:29,380
And grasp what caused them so that we can

477
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,540
address

478
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:38,260
Those causes before they wind up unfolding into one or another catastrophe that we're headed toward right now

479
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:42,180
Okay, so precognitive remote viewing is a thing. It's been used for

480
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:46,420
Oh, I don't know 45 years at this point

481
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,620
effectively by various governments

482
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:52,260
and now by the corporate sector

483
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,100
and

484
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:57,060
So that's one thing that people could do is to train that ability

485
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:00,020
But see that goes back to a point that I've made

486
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:05,620
Throughout my work from the beginning from Prometheus and out were from Prometheus and Atlas onwards

487
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,220
Is that suppose

488
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:11,220
you're trying to remote view

489
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:16,980
The outcome of the second American civil war, which I'm increasingly convinced that we're headed into

490
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,940
or the outcome of the third world war

491
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:23,940
And your objective is to find out let's say whether, you know

492
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:29,140
Russia winds up in a favorable position at the end of world war three because let's say France

493
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:32,500
Leaves NATO or whatever or you're trying to find out

494
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,940
What kind of government exists in the United States in

495
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,420
2028 right

496
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:41,460
But as part of seeing that future

497
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:46,740
You also see what happens in terms of your relationship with your wife

498
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:51,380
Or you see the death of certain of your children

499
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:58,020
How will that impact your life how capable will you be of dealing with that

500
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:01,620
What changes will result in your immediate situation?

501
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:05,220
As a consequence of that so, you know, I think

502
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:13,940
Many people even those who have the initiative to go and train themselves in the use of such abilities many of those people

503
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:20,820
Are not prepared for the psychological consequences of say seeing some things in their own personal future

504
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,220
That might be part of

505
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:27,140
A glimpse into our social or political future

506
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:33,620
Even if they have the ability to prevent that somewhat from happening if they know about in advance in a way

507
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,620
It's kind of empowering too

508
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:43,620
Here's the thing about that love is that look just um looking at my own life to give you a very personal answer

509
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,060
If

510
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:49,700
you were if if let's say 20 years ago

511
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:54,420
I had pre-cognitively remote viewed certain things that happened

512
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:58,180
In my life particularly involving relationships with

513
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,220
certain individuals

514
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,860
I might have

515
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:07,220
At that time with the psychology that I had in the moment

516
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:11,700
Endeavored to prevent those events from taking place

517
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,420
or let's say certain relationships from

518
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,860
deteriorating in certain ways and so forth, right?

519
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:24,660
Well by doing so I would also have prevented myself from reaching the place that I'm at today

520
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,260
And I can say that

521
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,700
frankly

522
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,180
Looking at the big picture

523
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,980
and thinking

524
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:39,140
About this from the deepest level

525
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,940
I have no regrets

526
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:45,700
And I'm not sure that the Giorgiani of 20 years ago

527
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,580
would have had the insight

528
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:52,260
Or the wisdom to understand why

529
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,940
It was perhaps important for those things to happen

530
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,220
So it's a very burdensome thing

531
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:02,580
to see elements of your own future

532
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,200
And to think that you'll be able to handle

533
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:11,300
The question of whether or not you should act to change certain things, right?

534
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:15,060
So so it makes it very hard. It makes it very hard

535
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:20,580
You know to to expect even a small minority of people with great initiative

536
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,740
and motivation

537
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:26,820
To be able to train themselves in these abilities for the sake of

538
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,820
averting

539
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:31,540
You know catastrophes on a social or political scale

540
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:36,260
I see what you mean does it necessarily

541
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,420
need to

542
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:41,620
Be a cultivation of those future seeing

543
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,220
skills

544
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:47,140
If one goes down the path of training their concentration

545
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:50,900
Or could a person decide you know what I don't want to see the future

546
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:54,100
But I do want to be able to do certain things

547
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,660
That go beyond being a

548
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,780
Regular human being as I was before

549
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:07,220
Can people choose or is it a matter of once you start going in one direction all of a sudden everything else just opens up like a sponge

550
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:12,580
I think one. Yeah, you know, I think it's possible to choose but

551
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,460
But I think that

552
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:20,020
There's only a certain latitude for control there because psi phenomena in general

553
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,420
Are a function of the subconscious

554
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,620
And so and this has been a theme throughout the course of my work

555
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,780
including in my

556
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,780
fiction quote-unquote

557
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,340
The idea that

558
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,260
In order to exercise phenomenal authorization

559
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:39,300
You need to make the subconscious conscious to a certain extent

560
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:43,700
And you need to be able to project conscious will into the domain of the subconscious

561
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:49,220
So there's a certain deconstruction of the barrier between the conscious mind and the subconscious that needs to take place

562
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,860
and and a certain

563
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,460
uh

564
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,460
a certain

565
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,460
capacity to

566
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,900
Will

567
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,640
Processes that are usually subconscious

568
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:08,740
Like people do in lucid dreams. I mean dream states are subconscious states

569
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:15,380
But there's a phenomenon of lucid dreaming where people exercise willpower in dreams and it's not coincidental

570
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:20,660
That remote viewers in certain protocols are first trained in how to

571
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,380
uh become lucid dreamers

572
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:29,860
Is there a certain timeline that you can give to somebody who is interested in taking the plunge?

573
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:36,260
And uh acquiring these skills. How long would it usually take for someone who?

574
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,900
Well, would be committed to such a thing

575
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:44,500
You know, I don't have the personal expertise to to comment on that directly

576
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:49,460
But I can tell you what some of the best remote viewers have told me. I mean for example, you know

577
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:52,580
Lynn Buchanan who I had some level of connection with

578
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:55,940
um, Lynn Buchanan has said repeatedly that

579
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:59,700
uh, first of all, it's always possible to improve

580
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:05,140
But that some of the best remote viewers who he's trained, you know

581
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:09,780
He was the chief trainer for the cia dod remote viewing program for a while

582
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:13,700
so he trained all the other guys who were the best in the program and

583
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:20,020
He was of the view that uh, it really takes decades to produce an ace remote viewer

584
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,900
now, you know with things like ai

585
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:26,660
and neural link type psychotronic technology

586
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:33,300
And potentially genetic augmentation because actually it's been found that there are certain genetic correlates

587
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,780
Of high aptitude for psi

588
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:42,580
Right. So ai seems to be an ability that has a genetic basis to some extent just like

589
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,900
aptitude to become a virtuoso musician has genetic basis just like

590
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:50,580
Becoming an olympic class swimmer has some genetic correlate to it

591
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:55,060
Some people are going to be more or less genetically predisposed for high level of ability

592
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:57,540
in in uh in these

593
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:04,580
Various fields and the same is true with psi. It's very similar to the exercise of sports ability and the trainability of sports ability

594
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:07,540
Right. Like anyone can be trained to do it to some level

595
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:11,060
Anyone can, you know, not everyone's going to be a basketball player

596
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:15,220
No, but everyone can play basketball, but you might suck. Yeah. Yeah

597
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:20,900
So so the thing is there's a certain degree of genetic, uh, correlation and if now

598
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:23,140
We bring genetic

599
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:28,420
Engineering or gene editing into the mix and we combine it with neural link and we combine it with ai protocols

600
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:31,540
That can develop much more effective ways to learn remote viewing

601
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:34,340
Maybe you could cut that time down drastically

602
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:38,340
And it's a question of a few years rather than, you know, a decade or two

603
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:43,540
But it's it requires a significant investment of time and energy in any case. That's for sure

604
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:48,580
Do you also a last question regarding this, uh, ascendance? Do you also see a, uh,

605
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:56,020
usefulness of training the body in conjunction with the mind as far as exercises to make the body stronger

606
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:00,740
To, uh, you know, do certain tantric exercises as well to, uh,

607
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:07,060
Work on, you know, the chakras as they refer to, uh, that in the event of a danta and so on and so forth

608
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:14,900
Absolutely. I think that all of that, you know, should be part of a future Promethean society. No doubt about it. I mean, you know, uh,

609
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:18,740
I'm a philosopher where I've chosen to, you know,

610
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:23,220
Place my energy and my time in emphasis thus far at least in my life

611
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,540
is is, uh,

612
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:26,740
you know

613
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:33,540
Very much in line with how people like heidegger or jampolsacht or, you know, I don't know, uh

614
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:39,860
Wittgenstein lived their lives, right? I mean, we philosophers are a certain type, right? Yeah

615
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:46,820
So and then and then I have a literary dimension to me, which which, you know, gives me an affinity to people like kafka and

616
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:49,940
Uh, I don't know kamu and and and others

617
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:54,020
So I I'm that type of person. We're not going to be seeing Dr.

618
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:58,340
Giorgiani, uh, doing like a deadlifts and squats, uh, you know in the gym, uh,

619
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:06,820
Or are we or are we? Well, look, I'm at an interesting turning point in my life, frankly, because this book philosophy of the future

620
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:09,460
Represents a kind of culmination, right?

621
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:17,060
The fundamental structure of my philosophical project is complete now. That doesn't mean that I won't all of a sudden have a

622
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:20,740
shift of perspective or, you know, new ideas

623
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:25,700
Might not dawn on me and revolutionize my work in some way that happened with wittgenstein

624
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:31,940
You know, heidegger also had some dramatic developments in his later thinking. Uh, so yeah, sure. That's possible

625
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:34,820
But I am at a point of culmination

626
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:40,900
And also the colossus project represents in a in a tangible sense a significant development in my life

627
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:47,700
And probably changes of condition in my life that will afford me the opportunity to maybe spend time and energy doing some

628
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:54,340
Uh, other types of things how much it in, you know, for example, I certainly would love to go back to skiing

629
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:56,980
It was my favorite sport uh earlier in my life

630
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:01,780
And so, yeah, you know, I might I might put my energy in other directions

631
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:03,860
If I had to guess though, I would say that

632
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:10,100
If there's going to be a shift of energy and focus to some extent a lot of it will go into art and um art

633
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:14,980
Most likely in the sense of cinema or a visualization of my

634
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:17,780
literary work

635
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:19,780
That's I think very likely

636
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:25,700
Speaking of which by the way the cover for your book and the design of the book that was all you philosophy of the future

637
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:31,140
That's true. That's true. But I don't rule out. Let's say learning remote beyond. I don't rule that out at all

638
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:36,580
And you know, there's some people who I'm sure hope that that never happened

639
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:39,780
Going around in the ether

640
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:44,340
That that might be problematic for some of the vested interests in the world

641
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:48,980
But where exactly we go from here because we were just talking about

642
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:51,860
psychic abilities, but as far as

643
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:57,940
Defining reality itself as far as this destructive departure of world review warfare

644
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:04,340
When it comes to changing what exactly this whole thing we're experiencing is

645
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:07,860
I'm very fascinated by what that exactly would entail

646
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:11,940
But also what exactly is currently around us because

647
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:18,980
I do recall you were talking about how all of these galaxies and galaxy clusters and so and so forth

648
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:25,460
These are things for us to observe because we're looking out in order to see them that may be what they are

649
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:28,660
But then the question is well, where exactly does the

650
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:32,260
Real part end? Well, not real. I know you don't believe in real

651
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:37,940
But where exactly does the part that we can actually interact with it and there are other life forms there

652
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:43,060
Where does that end? Does it end on mars? Does it end on, you know, the uh word cloud?

653
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:47,540
You mean what's the edge of uh

654
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:52,500
Uh, what's the edge of phenomenal experience in this world? Yes. Yes

655
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:59,460
Well, I've thought a bit about this and I've discussed it in a couple of my books

656
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:02,580
to begin with

657
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:04,580
There are aspects of quantum theory

658
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:07,220
such as

659
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:09,220
wave particle duality

660
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:14,500
And the fact and the fact that a probability distribution on a quantum level

661
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:23,620
Never actualizes as a particle with a particular location until and unless it's been observed meaning measured by a

662
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:26,100
sentient

663
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:27,220
observer

664
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:31,620
And I I think that the people who push back against that, you know, that was the position of Niles Bohr

665
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:36,260
and uh, Werner Heisenberg and all the great, uh, quantum physicists in the

666
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:42,820
Early years and I think that these people reductionist materialists who are trying to push back against that and say that

667
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:47,300
Wave collapses can take place without sentient observers are trading in a bunch of nonsense

668
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:56,100
They invent hidden variables and string theories and all this other bullshit to claim that there are deterministic processes that underlie

669
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:58,420
the

670
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:00,020
the

671
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,260
That underlie the probabilistic

672
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:10,420
Uh quality of quantum phenomena, and I I don't there's no empirical evidence for that all of these are

673
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:12,020
Uh

674
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:14,660
purely speculative mathematical formalisms

675
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:18,820
Okay, that are just intended to give these people a sense of psychological security

676
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:22,900
There was a sorry to interrupt. There was also a physicist who said that it was the

677
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,700
I getting hit by

678
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:30,180
Something that caused this change to occur as opposed to observation itself

679
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:37,940
Yeah, well, that's moronic because the I is a structure made up of quantum particles ultimately just as the brain is

680
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:43,700
So what's causing the wave collapse, right? I mean quantum particles aren't causing other quantum part

681
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:46,740
Quantum particles aren't causing wave

682
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:49,380
Distributions to collapse into particles

683
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:54,420
An observer is doing that and so you just can't get consciousness from out of the mix there

684
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:58,180
You cannot you know extricate the psyche from

685
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:02,660
The cosmos as it's manifesting through logos

686
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:07,220
Out of chaos psyche is an inextricable element in this process here

687
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:12,660
But anyway, what I was going to say was that there are aspects of quantum theory like this, you know

688
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:19,540
Wave article duality or rather the fact that everything is only a probability distribution until it's observed

689
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:23,620
Which is similar to what we call conditional rendering in

690
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:25,540
video game

691
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:32,020
Programming where you don't render something that's not being observed by any one or another player in the game

692
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:34,420
Because it's just in elegant

693
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:36,820
And by the way, I have a silent conversation about this the other day

694
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:40,180
um

695
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:41,860
Where look

696
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:43,460
Someone might

697
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:47,860
Think that the reason for that is that there's a limited amount of energy and processing power

698
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:51,460
But that's not necessarily the case

699
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:53,940
If you're designing

700
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,100
a game

701
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,100
You might just

702
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:02,500
Employ conditional rendering because it would be in elegant not to do so

703
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:07,460
I mean like when you're building a stage set for a theatrical production, right?

704
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:09,940
And there's there has to be a house

705
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:12,340
on the on the set

706
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:15,540
What moron goes and builds a complete living room?

707
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:20,340
That the audience is never going to see any of the actors

708
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:25,380
Enter into right you don't do that. That's not the way it's method acting jason. That's what that is

709
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:28,900
You know, you got to get full immersion into but yeah, I understand what you're saying

710
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:33,860
Good method actors wouldn't actually even do that to get into the role. But in any case, yes

711
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:36,740
So I just think it's a question of elegance

712
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:37,700
but

713
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:44,020
features of quantum theory like that or quantum entanglement where you know, if you interact with

714
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:50,580
You take two particles that have had interaction with one another and you do a measurement on one of them

715
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:55,700
It actually affects the other one that's now moved to a discrete location

716
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:58,260
And so these two particles appear to be

717
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:06,820
Entangled in a way where anything that affects one of them causes a change in the other one. Well, there's also a process like that

718
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:08,740
in

719
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:10,020
the

720
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:12,180
coordinated change of pixels

721
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:13,940
in the

722
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:17,860
Rendering of a video game where certain pixels are coded to basically

723
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:21,220
Change simultaneously change their state simultaneously

724
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:26,500
And so there are these various features that appear similar to programming code

725
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:29,780
In the design of simulacra

726
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:34,580
And then there are other things that are even more bizarre like we've discussed in another episode

727
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:38,260
That the number 26 keeps popping up at different scales

728
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:42,180
In the cosmos whether it's in terms of the distance between

729
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:47,060
You know the or the diameter of the moon or you know the distance between

730
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:57,940
Our solar system and the center of the galaxy or the time that it takes for our solar system to circumnavigate the galaxy

731
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:06,580
These are all multiples of the number 26 for some reason. Well, that doesn't make any sense in a in a

732
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:09,860
physical cosmos the way that

733
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:12,020
reductionist materialists think about

734
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:18,420
You know the the universe that they imagine us to be living in nor for that matter does the efficacy of zodiacal astrology

735
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:21,060
Which is something I've touched on in numerous works of mine

736
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:24,180
The fact that there's good scientific evidence for example

737
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:29,220
The work of michelle gaughan showing that people do going to career paths

738
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:36,260
Influenced by you know the position of the stars at the time of their or position of the at least the planets at the time of their birth

739
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:43,060
Well, that suggests that we're living in a kind of symbol system that the cosmos is informational rather than physical in nature

740
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:44,820
That we're in fact

741
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:50,100
Inside of an information processing system of some kind. So, yeah, you know, you can wonder then

742
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:53,380
What's the size of the information processing system, you know

743
00:53:54,100 --> 00:54:00,500
Is it are we in something like what's depicted in dark city? Is that what's going on here? You know, how

744
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:04,740
How uh, what's the scale of the matrix that we're inside of?

745
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:08,660
Well, the one counter that I can think of giving

746
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:14,580
To you about that is the idea of the macrocosm and microcosm where

747
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:17,220
I can imagine there being

748
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:23,700
Certain processes that are going on that are greater than us and in comparison to which we're like the cells inside of the mind

749
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:28,500
And I can imagine this going up like some kind of a russian matryoshka doll

750
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:34,420
Where there could be like certain higher consciousnesses of you know, uh, planets

751
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:38,020
Or stars or galaxies like it never ends now

752
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:41,460
I'm not saying that this is something that I'm that attached to

753
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:48,020
But it is interesting just to see like how certain patterns exist in nature both in the small and in the high end

754
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:53,140
Like when people observe galaxies, for instance, that makes me think those galaxies can't all be fake, you know

755
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:57,220
There must be like some bigger process at work here that we're just not aware of

756
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:00,180
I'll tell you why I disagree with you

757
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:03,460
I can imagine what you're saying very well

758
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:06,580
And it's very intriguing

759
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:10,100
and in some way I would like that to be true because

760
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:18,100
You know the vast or the cosmos is the more interesting that the evolutionary development possibilities are for all of the

761
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:23,060
Organisms in it ourselves included. However, the reason why I

762
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:27,700
First of all, there's no empirical evidence that what you're saying is true

763
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:33,460
We don't have empirical evidence of that the empirical evidence that we do have of intelligence

764
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:36,420
That's higher than ours

765
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:39,140
Suggest that actually

766
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:41,380
Maybe sadly

767
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:43,380
We're incredibly important

768
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:48,980
If you look at the close encounter phenomenon, which I've written an entire book about and which I've mentioned

769
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:51,300
I've discussed significantly in several other of my books

770
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:56,180
Including a bit in philosophy of the future. If you look at the close encounter phenomenon

771
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:01,300
Let's put these Nordics aside for a minute, right these these

772
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:06,980
People who look like SS officers flying around in their, you know, mercury thorium

773
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:09,620
Saucers, right muscle down blonde women

774
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:12,660
Yeah, I mean and they're they're real

775
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:17,380
There was real as you and I are these are people and you know

776
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:25,140
They don't I I think they have very deleterious intentions for the near future of our world society

777
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:27,380
But let's put them aside for the moment

778
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:31,060
Because I think that actually as I've argued in various books of mine

779
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:34,340
They're as terrified of this other thing that I'm about to discuss

780
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:42,500
As some of our government officials are and this other thing this trickster that seems to be able to produce

781
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:46,260
polymorphous phenomena of all kinds

782
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:49,940
And that has access to people's bedrooms in the middle of the night

783
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,500
And that sometimes abducts their children

784
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:55,140
And it takes genetic material from them

785
00:56:55,620 --> 00:57:02,900
And they can shape shift into any number of shamanic forms often drawing from the symbolism of owls and mantids and so forth

786
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:06,180
Right this entity which I discuss at length

787
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:10,180
in chapter seven of closer encounters and which I come back to

788
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:13,700
Contemplating at the end of philosophy of the future

789
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:19,700
This entity seems awfully interested in human individuals

790
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:22,500
We are not irrelevant

791
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:24,820
This thing has tremendous intelligence

792
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:27,700
It is superior to humanity

793
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:31,620
It's probably capable of destroying humanity

794
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:34,500
It certainly has taken apart

795
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:37,700
human civilizations of global scale before

796
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:40,500
This is how Atlantis was destroyed ultimately

797
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:44,740
And

798
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:48,100
This entity seems incredibly interested in human individuals

799
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:50,980
We are not at all like

800
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:58,980
Termites or ants or whatever to this thing every time I hear someone like Michio Kaku say that or any one of these people

801
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:01,060
Avi Loeb or whatever

802
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:07,540
It's really aggravating to me because the empirical evidence from close encounters doesn't support that at all

803
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:14,340
This entity sends emissaries and avatars to interact with us in incredibly intimate ways

804
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:18,100
And follows human individuals throughout their entire lives gets

805
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:21,620
Generationally involved with their offspring

806
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:25,060
It is it is deeply and intimately engaging

807
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:28,500
The human community and it has an agenda

808
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:33,540
Which whatever else you want to say about that agenda or speculate about it

809
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:39,460
Clearly sees the human being as central and of vital importance to its

810
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:42,100
project for the future

811
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:45,860
So that's why I I don't really agree with you that

812
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:52,100
Whatever the forms of intelligence are that are way beyond us and that are operating on a cosmic scale

813
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:56,340
We actually seem to be incredibly important to them which suggests that we're not actually

814
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:58,340
All that's separate from them

815
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:04,980
There's not such a huge gulf between us and them and when you think about the the technological singularity and the transformative potential that it has

816
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:08,340
That actually makes a lot of sense. We may be very close

817
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:10,900
to

818
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:12,420
uh

819
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:18,980
A transformation and mutation of our form of life that gives us parity with this

820
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:21,940
entity

821
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:24,100
I guess the only

822
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:27,780
Rebutal I would give to that is the idea that this entity

823
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:29,540
May exist

824
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:34,740
But there could be also other entities that are beyond that that we don't know and again. I have no proof

825
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:39,860
For yeah, but there's no evidence for that lab. I mean and look I am as I've said to you before

826
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:47,540
Uh in our previous conversations and as is abundantly clear from my philosophical work. I'm a radical empiricist

827
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:57,540
I'm a radical empiricist. I believe in you know, uh developing ontological and epistemological ideas

828
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,100
uh that are

829
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:06,740
Consonant with phenomena that we can experience and observe and that we can you know

830
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:13,060
tangibly make some sense out of and and doing so in ways that afford us opportunities for tangible

831
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:16,340
technological development

832
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:18,420
And and you know productive artistic

833
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:26,180
Endeavors so I'm very much a radical empiricist and why do you say it's uh one

834
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:29,620
Entity though as opposed to a multiplicity of entities

835
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:31,860
that

836
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:33,860
Work in a similar fashion

837
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:36,980
It is a multiplicity of entities

838
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:41,060
But when you really, you know, the devil is in the details

839
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:43,460
quite literally

840
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:46,500
And when you look at the details of some of these close encounters

841
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:53,700
You have to come away with the conclusion that there is some kind of

842
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:57,620
Uh, how can I put it?

843
01:00:57,620 --> 01:01:01,460
I don't want to use the term high of mind because it's it's not

844
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:05,220
Something like the borg that we're dealing with. It is not a

845
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:07,940
collective intelligence

846
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:10,020
or a kind of um

847
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:12,180
Uh organic

848
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:17,700
Unity that subsumes the individual the way that the borg

849
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:23,620
Uh assimilates and extinguishes the individuality of the people who are

850
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:28,260
Assimilated by the collective. That's not what we're dealing with. In fact

851
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:31,380
This

852
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:36,660
Super organism appears to want to encourage individuation and differentiation

853
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:39,860
For the sake of maximizing creative potential

854
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:45,780
So I don't want to call it a hive mind. Okay, but it appears that these entities

855
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:53,380
Are operating in tandem in a way that suggests the functioning of some higher

856
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:55,620
Organizing intelligence

857
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:57,220
albeit

858
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:59,220
Very finite

859
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:03,380
Intelligence is certainly not anything like an omniscient or omnipotent god

860
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:06,580
Well in the buddhism

861
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:12,260
The value that you're giving towards human beings is in a way echoed when they talk about human beings

862
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:15,780
A rebirth within that realm is the best of all

863
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:22,260
Obviously you disagree with the direction the buddhas end up going to but their reasoning is when you're in the realm of the

864
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:24,900
Higher end gods or the jealous gods

865
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:29,940
You're always going to be a lot more raptured in having all this power to deal with

866
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:33,940
Same thing when you're in the realm of the hell beings or the hungry ghosts

867
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:38,260
So I don't know if that is a concept that is close to you as well

868
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:43,540
Like that reason for human beings being so special even if you go in a different direction with it

869
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:48,260
Actually, yes, I would say so and you know someday we should do an entire show just on

870
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:50,980
what I think of buddhism because

871
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:53,860
I've said before, you know the

872
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:56,100
On an ontological and epistemological level

873
01:02:56,100 --> 01:03:03,220
there's actually a lot of overlap between my work and the thought of gotama and nagarjuna and some of the serious, you know

874
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:08,420
thinkers in the history of the buddhidharma from the beginning and

875
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:11,220
you're right that

876
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:16,180
In a certain way what i'm saying about this entity's interest in humanity is

877
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:18,980
consonant with

878
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:20,980
Gotama's valuation

879
01:03:21,620 --> 01:03:26,100
Of the human community over that of both the devas and the ashuras

880
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:29,460
You know gotama recognized rightly

881
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:32,180
That I mean, you know just recognized right?

882
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:38,020
He was he was a reincarnation of someone who had lived in deva realms previously

883
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:46,260
And he was familiar with the ashura realms the realms of what we call in in a west western tradition the olympians and the titans

884
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:48,820
and

885
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:52,500
He knew based on personal memory and amnesis

886
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:55,620
that

887
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:06,660
There is more possibility for personal development and the achievement of insight in the human realm than there is in these other

888
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:09,540
worlds

889
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:14,260
Uh, and I think this entity feels the same way, but the difference is

890
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:17,220
that gotama thought that

891
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:22,100
total enlightenment ultimately meant the extinguishing of individuality

892
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:27,220
and he has a nihilistic view of suffering as

893
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:29,780
having no

894
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:31,300
ultimate

895
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:34,580
purpose that you know suffering is futile

896
01:04:35,140 --> 01:04:38,420
And that what we should aim at is the extinguishing of suffering

897
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:41,620
Whereas this entity I think very much

898
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:44,180
Or rather I should say

899
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:49,780
Nietzsche very much shares the the outlook of this entity, which is that suffering is

900
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:53,780
Absolutely indispensable to any creative endeavor

901
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:56,500
Uh, and that the great creators

902
01:04:57,620 --> 01:04:58,820
need

903
01:04:58,820 --> 01:05:01,380
suffering as part of you know the

904
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:08,260
Generative process that they act as conduits for in this world

905
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:12,180
Right, and you can see that very much for example at the core of the myth of prometheus

906
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:19,860
There's tremendous tragic suffering in the myth of prometheus, which Nietzsche discusses in the birth of tragedy specifically right prometheus as this

907
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:25,380
Tragic image of human aspiration and as the first uh mask

908
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:27,940
um in greek theater, so

909
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:30,100
so

910
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:32,660
The tragic life affirming view

911
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:36,100
Of Nietzsche

912
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:39,380
Is much more in line with how this entity

913
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:41,620
sees

914
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:43,300
human evolution

915
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:45,860
Than gotama's nihilistic will

916
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:49,620
To end suffering by extinguishing individuality

917
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:56,900
Before we proceed onwards. There is also the uh roodolph steiner view, which I see as being related

918
01:05:57,220 --> 01:06:01,940
When he talked about how when you would observe a plant or a tree

919
01:06:02,340 --> 01:06:08,500
Or anything in your vicinity in the way you're giving life to it and that reminds me of what you're talking about this

920
01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:14,180
Generating informational computational system that we're in where our

921
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:20,660
Looking out at something in a way does give more life to it than it may have originally had

922
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:29,460
Because we're imbuing whatever we're looking at maybe including another person or including whatever we would consider to be a god of sorts

923
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:34,580
We're imbuing that with the power it did not originally have before we uh looked at it

924
01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:37,140
Or before we thought about it

925
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:42,180
Yeah, the yeah look steiner has any number of very interesting insights here and there

926
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:48,100
And and he was a very innovative thinker in some ways and particularly when it comes to like applied fields

927
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:53,780
He was a polymath, you know who developed innovative educational techniques and

928
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:58,420
I don't know botany and agricultural methods and all kinds of interesting things

929
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:03,060
But the uh essential problem with steiner is that he's a strange sort of gnostic

930
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:06,260
Who has a basically dualistic ontology?

931
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:11,380
And this is something that i'm trying to deconstruct in my work with my concept of the spectral revolution

932
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:18,500
This idea that you know, they're for steiner. There's this transcendental realm, which you know is uh

933
01:07:19,220 --> 01:07:22,900
Sort of presided over by lucifer and then there's this purely

934
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:29,220
materialistic realm which is controlled by ahriman and that the human experience is kind of a

935
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:32,660
Middle ground between these polarities, right?

936
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:36,980
I deconstruct that kind of dualism just as niche does

937
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:42,100
And uh, I think there's only one world. There's the world of our phenomenal experience

938
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:48,420
And you know what we frame as the spiritual versus the physical is a question again of

939
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:56,740
Linguistic structures the conditioned consciousness and that's set in place filters for our perception and our processing of our experience

940
01:07:56,980 --> 01:08:02,180
Our experience of a singular world of experience. I mean our experience of a singular world

941
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:07,380
Which you know, the greeks called fuses going back to our quite as nature as it were

942
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:10,740
But within that world we would also have let's say

943
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:14,820
Certain places that people would only be able to observe

944
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:21,380
During the in-between state of uh, you know the afterlife. I guess you could say so

945
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:27,220
Similarly, we could have like with the japanese buddhas. They have this conception of pure land buddhism

946
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:32,260
Which is like this whole other realm that you can go into and like that'll meditate all day or whatever

947
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:36,580
So i'm not sure exactly as far as the amount of

948
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:42,580
Real estate that we have to work with here including like going back in time that you were talking about as well

949
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:44,740
You know, how

950
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:50,180
How much is there to explore how much is there to uncover or is it pretty much like

951
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:54,660
The earth and however we keep going, you know expanding beyond that

952
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:57,380
Look, I think there's a lot of real estate again, though

953
01:08:57,380 --> 01:09:01,140
Let me emphasize the fact that it's it's a question of filters

954
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:04,020
You know when people die

955
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:08,660
Filters are removed

956
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:18,020
Filters that are integral to this particular form this construction that we take to be the physical human body

957
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:23,700
Filters are removed and other dimensions of experience become perceivable

958
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:29,620
It's not that there's another world. We don't go into the other side after we die. Okay, this is these are

959
01:09:30,820 --> 01:09:38,740
Dangerous delusions that are being propagated today as part of a discourse that I think ultimately is going to be used to implement

960
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:46,260
traditionalism and kind of neo feudal subjugation of humanity under a sort of kingdom of heaven

961
01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:48,980
and you know

962
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:51,460
I think that it's important to acknowledge first of all

963
01:09:51,940 --> 01:09:59,460
That there's a singular realm of experience and that our capacity to perceive various dimensions of it is a question of what filters are operating

964
01:09:59,860 --> 01:10:03,860
Now drugs can remove certain of those filters like for example DMT

965
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:08,500
Giving us access to these realms where there are apparently these machine elves

966
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:12,740
But in the same DMT spaces, there are also these reptilians who rape women

967
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:16,580
Okay, so my issue with what you said about the pure land

968
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:21,940
Hmm is that so far as I've heard in the contemporary

969
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:26,340
uh realm of research on altered states of consciousness

970
01:10:26,980 --> 01:10:31,780
Nobody has come back and given us a report about the buddhist pure land as far as I'm aware

971
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:36,900
Now, of course, there are buddhist writings where these monks claim, you know to have connected with that realm

972
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:41,380
But you know, there's a lot to psychological projection. I mean you can you can really like really

973
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:44,340
Imagine yourself in a different milieu

974
01:10:45,060 --> 01:10:51,060
With vivid clarity basically put yourself into a lucid dream while you're meditating. That's one thing

975
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:53,380
But in terms of uh, you know

976
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:59,700
Phenomenological realms of experience that could be shared by other people the way that I think the DMT space can be

977
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:07,700
I don't see anything like the pure land. I don't see any and I'm making this point very deliberately because uh,

978
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:15,140
I wanted to be impressed upon the listener that there's nowhere to escape to that doesn't involve conflict and suffering

979
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:18,340
The DMT realm involves terrifying shit

980
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:24,580
Any, you know, honest authentic account of that makes it very clear that it is not a safe place to be

981
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:27,300
Okay, so

982
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:31,700
Uh, I think that again, you know, this whole notion

983
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:37,220
That we should seek an enlightenment that involves

984
01:11:38,020 --> 01:11:40,580
ultimate peace tranquility and harmony

985
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:46,660
And eventually also the effacing of our ego and the annihilation of our individuality

986
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:49,380
Is completely misguided

987
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:52,980
And it's the most sophisticated form of nihilism

988
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:59,300
Nietzsche saw this by the way. He said look at least I respect buddhism because its form of nihilism is more sophisticated

989
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:04,740
Than that of christianity, right? If you're going to be a nihilist be a buddhist not a christian, right? So

990
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:10,100
Uh, my work very much flies in the face of that kind of nihilism

991
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:13,060
Well, uh, speaking of effacing the ego

992
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:17,540
I think now would be a good time to get to the kind of effacing that's going on right now

993
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:23,460
with the uh, palestine protests going on in the new york city and uh, all over

994
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:30,900
And the general trend that I mean we talked about this before the convergence in a way that i'm seeing of the ultra left

995
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:37,060
and uh, certain elements of the uh, further right when it comes to wanting to embrace this kind of

996
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:44,660
Traditionalism, but this kind of like almost like third worldist type of traditionalism where a lot of those protesters

997
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:51,060
You know, they have no problem with china. They have no problem with uh, you know, whatever's going on in africa in the middle east

998
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:56,180
They have a big problem with these, uh, you know, 18th 17th century

999
01:12:56,660 --> 01:13:02,820
Statues and monuments, you know to uh, western civilization. That's what they want to get rid of

1000
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:07,380
So where exactly do you see this going right now?

1001
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:10,020
Uh, jason, you've uh, well got the floor. Yeah

1002
01:13:12,820 --> 01:13:14,820
Look, there's so much that I want to say about this

1003
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:21,780
I kind of don't even know where to begin and uh, you know, you know, because we were trying to organize a show some time ago weeks ago

1004
01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:23,700
um

1005
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:26,660
That I really didn't want to talk about this subject public

1006
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:29,300
I really tried not to say anything about this publicly

1007
01:13:29,620 --> 01:13:34,260
Because we're involved in some very positive optimistic work with the colossus project

1008
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:36,820
and you know, I want to uh

1009
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:43,460
I want to do as much as I can to make sure that that moves forward

1010
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:48,180
Expeditiously and triumphantly that having been said

1011
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:54,580
It's just gone too far. It's gone way too far

1012
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:59,780
So you mentioned pulling down of statues, right back in the summer of of george floyd

1013
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:02,740
The summer of george floyd summer of love

1014
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:08,180
Yes in 2020, right. I love how these fuckers who were, you know, uh

1015
01:14:09,620 --> 01:14:17,460
Desecrating our war memorials and want to pull down the statues of our founders also do instagram posts where you know, it's all about love

1016
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:20,420
It's all about love man. That's all it matters and the world is love

1017
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:26,500
And then they go and they burn the american flag or they raise the palestinian flag higher than the american flag on flag polls

1018
01:14:26,820 --> 01:14:33,860
Right, and then they go and they desecrate, you know war memorials to uh, you know, uh, world war one heroes in this country

1019
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:37,140
And burn american flags of the but no, it's all about love

1020
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:42,660
right, uh, anyway, um, what I was going to say was that back in the summer of george floyd

1021
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:48,020
We saw them starting to pull down all these statues. So the founders of our country including

1022
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:55,140
This great sculpture of theodore roosevelt that was on the steps of the museum of natural history in new york

1023
01:14:55,380 --> 01:14:57,380
There's a place that was dear to my heart from childhood

1024
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:01,300
And um

1025
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:08,740
They didn't even care whether the the founders were slave owners or not they pulled down statues of abraham lincoln

1026
01:15:09,620 --> 01:15:12,180
Back in the summer of george. So that summer

1027
01:15:12,660 --> 01:15:17,140
With you know, what happened in minneapolis? What happened in portland the whole chas

1028
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:19,700
encampment and so on and so forth, right

1029
01:15:20,660 --> 01:15:22,660
That was a watershed moment

1030
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:25,380
And I founded prometheism

1031
01:15:26,020 --> 01:15:30,100
In response to that if you look at when prometheism was founded july 4th

1032
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:33,620
2020 what was the context that was the context?

1033
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:41,300
Okay, so that was a watershed moment. We're at another turning point now. Okay. We are at another

1034
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:43,300
uh

1035
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:46,260
Rubicon crossing of the rubicon moment right now

1036
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:50,900
Where

1037
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:54,500
Let me take this angle

1038
01:15:54,820 --> 01:15:56,820
where

1039
01:15:56,820 --> 01:15:58,580
slogans

1040
01:15:58,580 --> 01:16:00,580
That were devised

1041
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:04,100
By ayatollah homini in iran

1042
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:06,500
during

1043
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:10,180
The hostage crisis while american hostages were being held in terron

1044
01:16:11,380 --> 01:16:14,420
Ayatollah homini and his fellow molas

1045
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:18,420
Came up with these slogans like death to america

1046
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:24,260
Which are now being chanted on the campuses and the streets of american cities

1047
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:31,780
And in some cases we literally see agents of the islamic republic coming and setting up seminars to teach americans

1048
01:16:31,940 --> 01:16:37,860
How to chant not just death to america in english, but marg bar america in persia literally

1049
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:40,340
Teaching them how to pronounce this enchantment

1050
01:16:41,940 --> 01:16:43,940
And these same people

1051
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:46,580
Are burning american flags

1052
01:16:47,940 --> 01:16:50,260
And they're passing out leaflets saying

1053
01:16:51,620 --> 01:16:55,380
The freedom of palestine means death to america

1054
01:16:56,660 --> 01:16:58,340
Right

1055
01:16:58,340 --> 01:17:01,620
Self-described anarchists self-described communists

1056
01:17:02,820 --> 01:17:06,820
Who are supporting an organization namely hamas

1057
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:10,260
Who they characterize as freedom fighters?

1058
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:18,580
But who are actually radical fundamentalist adherents of a religion that endorses slavery

1059
01:17:19,780 --> 01:17:23,220
That endorses the enslavement of women

1060
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:28,180
And their total degradation as second or third class citizens

1061
01:17:29,220 --> 01:17:32,900
And the religion that violently conquered and genocided

1062
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:40,820
Other cultures in the world and deprived them of any freedom of religion or freedom of conscience or freedom of expression

1063
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:45,460
Self-described communists and anarchists who

1064
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:53,940
Whether or not we agree with their ideology at least were supposedly advocates for freedom and liberation

1065
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:59,300
Right and we're supposedly struggling against capitalism because it was too oppressive

1066
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:07,700
Right and that it was uh too much of a constraint on the human individual and that it didn't go far enough

1067
01:18:07,780 --> 01:18:13,780
Let's say in liberating women these same communists and anarchists are now supporting the most regressive

1068
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:16,500
traditionalist ideology on the planet

1069
01:18:16,740 --> 01:18:18,900
Which is being spearheaded by hamas

1070
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:22,900
What the fuck is going on here?

1071
01:18:24,420 --> 01:18:29,940
Right and meanwhile you have in europe for example, we saw what a week ago. I think it was in germany

1072
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:35,860
Mass protests. I mean math tens of thousands. Where did these people come from?

1073
01:18:36,820 --> 01:18:38,820
Who let these people into europe?

1074
01:18:39,700 --> 01:18:44,580
Oh anglo-merkel, right? I remember now, right 2013 2014

1075
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:51,860
Yeah, well the the chickens come home to roost at this point tens of thousands of people are marching in germany

1076
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:55,140
demanding an islamic caliphate replace the german government

1077
01:18:56,020 --> 01:19:00,900
So that's going on in europe where we literally have muslim armies on the street

1078
01:19:01,540 --> 01:19:03,540
demand and then in britain

1079
01:19:03,540 --> 01:19:05,540
islamic parties

1080
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:07,940
allied with leftists are winning elections

1081
01:19:08,740 --> 01:19:10,580
left and right

1082
01:19:10,580 --> 01:19:12,740
And they're using their political power

1083
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:19,300
To completely strip the british citizen of all their fundamental freedoms like we saw happen in scotland in particular

1084
01:19:19,540 --> 01:19:25,860
And ireland's having kind of identity crisis where on the one hand ireland traditionally, you know with the ira and such

1085
01:19:26,180 --> 01:19:31,460
We're supporting palestine, but now they're also having this influx of these migrants that are coming in

1086
01:19:31,780 --> 01:19:33,860
They want to it's straight out of lord of the rings

1087
01:19:33,940 --> 01:19:38,500
They want to tear down this beautiful ancient tree in order to build a migrant center

1088
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:41,540
And now there's this war that's going on between the

1089
01:19:42,260 --> 01:19:44,900
irish people who live there and the people that want to tear it down

1090
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:48,420
So i don't know what's going on specifically with those people

1091
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:51,860
I mean thankfully a lot of the irish people are standing up for themselves right now

1092
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:57,620
But yeah, they're also supporting palestine. They're also supporting palestine. What kind of sense does that make, you know?

1093
01:19:57,940 --> 01:20:00,820
That's very strange order irish. It's a disgrace

1094
01:20:02,020 --> 01:20:04,020
I think it's utterly disgraceful

1095
01:20:04,660 --> 01:20:06,660
you know like

1096
01:20:06,980 --> 01:20:08,980
For fuck's sake, okay israel

1097
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:12,020
was a secular

1098
01:20:12,260 --> 01:20:13,940
Progressive country

1099
01:20:13,940 --> 01:20:15,940
Which has demonstrated

1100
01:20:16,260 --> 01:20:24,660
tremendous capacity in contribution to technological science, which has fostered the arts a society where

1101
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:28,020
women are

1102
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:32,580
Respected to the point where the defense of the nation is also entrusted to them

1103
01:20:33,220 --> 01:20:40,980
A society that from the earliest days when the kibbutz movement formed the substrate of israeli society

1104
01:20:41,380 --> 01:20:44,260
Was based on radical egalitarianism

1105
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:46,740
okay

1106
01:20:46,740 --> 01:20:51,700
And a society that has always enshrined and protected freedom of speech freedom of the press

1107
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:59,780
Right and and yeah, and all the what we consider to be sacred and fundamental rights of the human individual on the one hand

1108
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:04,420
You have that society by the way a society that includes many israeli arabs

1109
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:07,700
Christians drues

1110
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:09,140
drues

1111
01:21:09,140 --> 01:21:10,980
at eight at the left

1112
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:12,980
Samaritans first society

1113
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:19,140
Okay, uh one devoted to the protection of the individual one devoted to uh, you know

1114
01:21:19,780 --> 01:21:21,780
The equality of women

1115
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:24,100
and one that has

1116
01:21:24,660 --> 01:21:26,660
contributed

1117
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:29,700
With tremendous disproportionate power

1118
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:32,900
To the advancement of science and technology

1119
01:21:33,380 --> 01:21:36,660
Okay, um, but the problem is that they're like the adult in the room

1120
01:21:36,660 --> 01:21:42,420
They're like the logical adult and the kids are like, you know, fuck you dad. I don't have to listen to you

1121
01:21:42,820 --> 01:21:46,020
It seems like it's that kind of relationship that's going on where people

1122
01:21:46,580 --> 01:21:52,020
Protesters against netanyahu the protesters against him, but in general just the anti-israel feeling

1123
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:54,260
I think a lot of it comes from

1124
01:21:54,420 --> 01:22:00,900
Maybe israel is not dianesean enough to put it a certain way because people who are looking at israel are just seeing

1125
01:22:00,980 --> 01:22:02,420
You know these very

1126
01:22:02,420 --> 01:22:05,300
Logical people who are trying to explain themselves

1127
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:09,940
Meanwhile people want to burn things down and cause all this chaos

1128
01:22:10,260 --> 01:22:12,500
I don't know if you've thought about it in that direction

1129
01:22:12,580 --> 01:22:16,100
But at least from people who I've spoken with they kind of see israel

1130
01:22:16,180 --> 01:22:19,860
I know this is very beneath you, but they see israel as cringe

1131
01:22:20,180 --> 01:22:25,860
You know that they don't see that kind of fire in israel's belly that would be a commanding force

1132
01:22:26,260 --> 01:22:31,940
And maybe that's why we have all these people online who are also going against israel just from an optics perspective

1133
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:36,020
Well, maybe you're right israel might not be dianesean enough

1134
01:22:37,220 --> 01:22:41,140
Dianesis is an incredibly violent symbol. So maybe israel should be a lot more violent

1135
01:22:41,380 --> 01:22:46,420
I would be absolutely in favor of that. I think this should be a lot more commanding. There might be something to what you're saying

1136
01:22:46,660 --> 01:22:48,980
no, there really might be something to what you're saying, but

1137
01:22:49,940 --> 01:22:56,180
Who is holding israel back? Well, now we know who's holding israel back because guess what it just came out

1138
01:22:56,900 --> 01:22:58,900
that the united states

1139
01:22:59,380 --> 01:23:01,380
The administration of joe biden

1140
01:23:02,260 --> 01:23:07,700
Sent the representative to negotiate with the islamic republic of iran in oman

1141
01:23:08,660 --> 01:23:09,620
Oh, man

1142
01:23:09,620 --> 01:23:17,220
Okay, and the deputy foreign minister of iran was the one present at those negotiations and guess what the subject of discussion was

1143
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:19,860
Bringing an end to the war in gaza

1144
01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:22,500
By changing the government in israel

1145
01:23:23,220 --> 01:23:26,020
So here's israel since october 7th

1146
01:23:26,820 --> 01:23:32,580
rightly aiming for regime change in iran, which would be a tremendous favor to the iranian people

1147
01:23:32,820 --> 01:23:41,540
And meanwhile the united states instead of helping israel to foment regime change in iran or at least not standing in the way of israel

1148
01:23:42,020 --> 01:23:47,860
The united states is secretly plotting with a regime whose slogan and maxim is death to america

1149
01:23:48,420 --> 01:23:51,380
In order to do what to change the government of israel

1150
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:57,220
Before we get deeper into this. I just want to say that about a year ago

1151
01:23:57,700 --> 01:24:03,540
I was at a party in the in the hamptons, you know the far far east there of long island

1152
01:24:03,940 --> 01:24:09,220
And I met a guy who was introduced to me by a friend as being part of masad

1153
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:16,900
Okay, and I told this guy the what you recommended, which is that israel should go into um

1154
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:22,180
Rather than gaza, you know should go into iran should decimate, uh, you know the government buildings

1155
01:24:22,180 --> 01:24:25,140
But leave the nukes alone and the masad guy said

1156
01:24:25,780 --> 01:24:30,420
Lev you're absolutely right. We should do this, but we can't because america won't let us

1157
01:24:31,860 --> 01:24:39,060
In order to corroborate that let me also tell you what someone very well positioned with a lot of connections to the israeli government told me

1158
01:24:39,460 --> 01:24:43,940
Which is that after october 7th like, you know on october 8th. Yeah

1159
01:24:44,740 --> 01:24:47,780
You remember how long it took israel to go into gaza, right? Yeah

1160
01:24:48,420 --> 01:24:52,100
It was long we were wait for weeks. We were wait. What what is this operation going to take place?

1161
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:57,460
You know why because actually netanyahu didn't want to go into gaza because netanyahu knew

1162
01:24:58,180 --> 01:25:02,580
What the optics of this were going to be like netanyahu wanted to bomb iran

1163
01:25:03,140 --> 01:25:07,300
He wanted to bomb the islamic republic out of existence rightfully so because

1164
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:16,740
Who's controlling the tentacles of this octopus? That's hamas and that's hezbollah and the houthis of yemen and you know the the various uh

1165
01:25:17,700 --> 01:25:25,460
Militias in iraq that are against israel obviously the regime in tehran so israel wanted to go after iran

1166
01:25:26,660 --> 01:25:30,740
The united states sent those two aircraft carriers into the Mediterranean

1167
01:25:31,380 --> 01:25:36,020
Not to support israel, but to intimidate and threaten israel

1168
01:25:36,660 --> 01:25:40,260
I know this for a fact what they told the israelis was here

1169
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:44,340
Here are these two aircraft carriers to help defend you

1170
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:48,900
But if you attack iran, we will publicly withdraw these carriers

1171
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:52,100
Sending a signal to the iranians that we don't have your back anymore

1172
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:54,900
okay, so

1173
01:25:54,980 --> 01:25:56,980
This is horrendous

1174
01:25:57,540 --> 01:26:02,340
especially when you have masses of leftists on the streets in america

1175
01:26:03,780 --> 01:26:06,740
And having taken over tens of our campuses

1176
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:09,700
chanting slogans

1177
01:26:09,700 --> 01:26:11,700
That were designed in tehran

1178
01:26:12,660 --> 01:26:19,700
When you have masses of people on the streets of america chanting death to america while burning american flags and desecrating american

1179
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:22,900
war memorials and at the same time

1180
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:24,740
you're

1181
01:26:24,740 --> 01:26:26,740
doing back room deals

1182
01:26:27,620 --> 01:26:29,620
with the islamic republic of iran

1183
01:26:31,380 --> 01:26:34,340
There is no higher form of treason than that

1184
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:38,020
That these protests were allowed to continue

1185
01:26:38,820 --> 01:26:42,500
For what is it now two months for two months?

1186
01:26:42,580 --> 01:26:47,700
We saw these campuses be taken out including by the way the campus of colombia university

1187
01:26:49,140 --> 01:26:54,020
Was a sacred place to me. There is a monument to athena there

1188
01:26:55,860 --> 01:27:00,580
That to me has always made that place the campus of athena campus in the roman sense

1189
01:27:00,580 --> 01:27:07,140
You know the word campus actually comes from the roman term for sacred precincts like the campus of mars

1190
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:09,780
In rome in ancient rome

1191
01:27:09,780 --> 01:27:12,500
And to me that place was always the campus of athena. I used to go there

1192
01:27:13,060 --> 01:27:20,900
You know in the wee hours of the morning before people showed up and just walk the colonnade there and silently contemplate and

1193
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:23,540
Pay my respects to athena

1194
01:27:24,820 --> 01:27:27,460
They desecrated that place they literally held

1195
01:27:28,180 --> 01:27:30,980
ceremonies converting american students to islam

1196
01:27:31,780 --> 01:27:36,980
Under the banner of the pro-palestine movement on the campus of colombia university in the shadow of athena

1197
01:27:37,220 --> 01:27:40,100
They literally put a banner around athena

1198
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:44,900
Renaming that place the people's university of palestine

1199
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:51,220
They excluded jews from the campus at colombia at yale at any number of other universities

1200
01:27:52,260 --> 01:27:54,260
They formed human chains

1201
01:27:54,660 --> 01:28:02,340
Backed by the security forces on the campus to prevent jewish students and jewish professors from entering the campus

1202
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:05,300
But there are from what i understand also

1203
01:28:05,540 --> 01:28:10,500
Leftist jews who are a part of the protest as has always been in history

1204
01:28:10,580 --> 01:28:17,940
Like people always love referring to like barbara learner specter or any of these idiots that are talking about you know wanting to destroy

1205
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:21,540
Europe and my whole point is that you're going to have jews

1206
01:28:21,860 --> 01:28:24,740
Who are going to have bad ideas as well as good ideas?

1207
01:28:24,980 --> 01:28:28,980
And those are going to be the jews that people end up paying attention to and unfortunately right now

1208
01:28:28,980 --> 01:28:33,140
I'm sure that there are some jewish students who are so self-hating

1209
01:28:33,460 --> 01:28:39,140
And who have this romance having to do with you know freeing palestine and all that that they're also going to join the cause

1210
01:28:40,180 --> 01:28:44,740
Well, if I were in mosad right now, I would find a way to start eliminating these people

1211
01:28:44,980 --> 01:28:52,260
I mean they represent an existential threat to israel. Well, I've always said I've always said this that israel will never

1212
01:28:52,580 --> 01:28:54,980
Be defeated by any foreign enemy

1213
01:28:55,780 --> 01:29:00,500
If israel is ever defeated one day, it will be defeated by traders from within

1214
01:29:01,380 --> 01:29:06,580
People within israel will defeat israel israel can never be defeated by any foreign enemy

1215
01:29:06,820 --> 01:29:10,180
That country has 300 nuclear warheads

1216
01:29:10,740 --> 01:29:18,020
And by the way that arsenal stands between islam and its ambition for the conquest of the west

1217
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:23,140
Never forget that never forget those 300 israeli nukes will be used

1218
01:29:23,700 --> 01:29:30,100
Before europe is conquered by islam. Okay, so look, but my point is this

1219
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:34,100
that when you have on the one hand these kinds of

1220
01:29:35,780 --> 01:29:38,260
rabidly anti-american protests taking place

1221
01:29:38,900 --> 01:29:41,540
On these campuses and in the streets of american cities

1222
01:29:42,180 --> 01:29:47,860
Desecrating war memorials and so forth burning the american flag raising the flag of palestine higher than the american flag

1223
01:29:48,420 --> 01:29:49,940
all the while

1224
01:29:49,940 --> 01:29:51,940
chanting death to america

1225
01:29:52,100 --> 01:29:54,100
and at the same time

1226
01:29:54,260 --> 01:30:01,140
us government officials are doing back room deals with the islamic republic to undercut israel

1227
01:30:02,820 --> 01:30:08,820
I don't know what worse form of treason we could see in our country than that

1228
01:30:09,700 --> 01:30:16,100
Okay, and so the to me the ultimate red line has already been crossed and as an iranian american

1229
01:30:16,580 --> 01:30:18,980
Look, I was born here. Okay, but

1230
01:30:20,740 --> 01:30:28,660
I know a lot of other iranian americans foremost my fiance who spent 13 years living in the fucking islamic republic

1231
01:30:29,220 --> 01:30:30,740
I can tell you

1232
01:30:30,740 --> 01:30:34,180
What it's like for iranian americans who fled that regime

1233
01:30:35,060 --> 01:30:36,660
to come here

1234
01:30:36,660 --> 01:30:39,540
Looking for a place where individual liberty is honored

1235
01:30:39,780 --> 01:30:45,220
And to hear the same slogan that they had to live with in iran

1236
01:30:45,700 --> 01:30:51,700
Mark that on recall death to america being chanted by american youth here on the streets of our cities

1237
01:30:52,660 --> 01:30:54,660
the iranian youth today

1238
01:30:55,460 --> 01:30:58,580
70 percent of iran is under the age of 30 iran

1239
01:30:59,220 --> 01:31:05,140
May have many problems, but the natalist problem is not one of them. It's a very youthful vigorous population

1240
01:31:05,860 --> 01:31:12,260
70 percent of the country's under the age of 30 and the iranian youth are undoubtedly the most pro-american population

1241
01:31:12,660 --> 01:31:16,740
On the planet. Okay out of time when anti-americanism is on the rise

1242
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:23,780
It's undoubtedly the case that the most solid future ally of america

1243
01:31:25,460 --> 01:31:28,180
Is the iranian nation? Okay

1244
01:31:28,420 --> 01:31:35,060
But what is a travesty is that the average iranian youth today the average

1245
01:31:35,700 --> 01:31:37,700
Iranian in their 20s or 30s today

1246
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:43,940
Cares more about american culture and has a better appreciation of america's history

1247
01:31:44,660 --> 01:31:46,660
than american youth do

1248
01:31:47,300 --> 01:31:51,300
And i'm i'm warning you people right i'm just giving issuing a general warning

1249
01:31:52,180 --> 01:31:57,620
This is not going to go to a good place. This is not going to go to a good place. Iran is a country

1250
01:31:58,660 --> 01:32:03,860
That has been conquered by greeks, romans, arabs

1251
01:32:04,980 --> 01:32:06,820
turks

1252
01:32:06,820 --> 01:32:08,820
and mongols

1253
01:32:09,460 --> 01:32:10,980
It suffered

1254
01:32:10,980 --> 01:32:12,980
genocidal conquests

1255
01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:15,060
at the hands of foreign enemies

1256
01:32:15,540 --> 01:32:17,540
and it came back

1257
01:32:17,540 --> 01:32:19,540
five times

1258
01:32:19,540 --> 01:32:21,860
Not just as a country as an empire

1259
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:24,020
five times

1260
01:32:24,020 --> 01:32:26,020
Okay, iran will rise again

1261
01:32:28,180 --> 01:32:30,180
The people of america

1262
01:32:30,180 --> 01:32:36,340
I don't i don't even want to use the term united states anymore because this fucking regime that calls itself the united states government

1263
01:32:36,740 --> 01:32:39,300
Is a treasonous criminal mafia

1264
01:32:40,260 --> 01:32:42,260
To which no one should pay taxes by the way

1265
01:32:42,900 --> 01:32:45,140
It is a treasonous criminal mafia

1266
01:32:45,700 --> 01:32:50,900
That does not represent the interests of americans, but the people of america should be very careful

1267
01:32:51,940 --> 01:32:54,340
To get this situation under control soon

1268
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:56,420
and to

1269
01:32:57,380 --> 01:33:00,260
Eliminate these vermin

1270
01:33:01,140 --> 01:33:07,860
Who have stripped themselves of their american citizenship by conducting themselves in this manner that we've seen over the past two months

1271
01:33:08,340 --> 01:33:10,340
otherwise

1272
01:33:10,820 --> 01:33:12,820
If iran rises again

1273
01:33:13,540 --> 01:33:19,700
And we have a population in iran that respects american culture and american history more than

1274
01:33:20,820 --> 01:33:22,820
american youth do

1275
01:33:23,460 --> 01:33:27,140
Something very bad is going to happen that i hope i never had lived to see

1276
01:33:27,700 --> 01:33:30,020
Okay, i'm telling you right now well if we can uh

1277
01:33:31,060 --> 01:33:33,220
Europe is fucked europe is fucked

1278
01:33:33,780 --> 01:33:37,460
All right, uh look at germany look at britain france

1279
01:33:37,460 --> 01:33:40,580
I have some hope for but let me be very frank with you

1280
01:33:41,140 --> 01:33:49,540
That right the latest figures that i've seen show 25 of the urban population of france is is living under sharia

1281
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:55,380
There are sharia no-go zones in stance where uh french

1282
01:33:56,180 --> 01:33:58,420
The french justice system no longer applies

1283
01:33:58,980 --> 01:34:02,900
And and france has the highest birth rate by the way as well in europe of muslims

1284
01:34:02,980 --> 01:34:06,100
Yeah, well, yeah, that's of the children of migrants

1285
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:13,700
Okay, and so look the figures in france are are extremely grim. It looks like about 25 of france

1286
01:34:14,900 --> 01:34:15,780
is

1287
01:34:15,780 --> 01:34:17,060
gone

1288
01:34:17,060 --> 01:34:22,100
Okay has been subsumed by basically the the fifth column of the caliphate

1289
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:25,540
Uh, but i actually think there's some hope for france

1290
01:34:26,020 --> 01:34:31,540
I think that if national front comes back in 2027 there is some hope for france. However

1291
01:34:32,420 --> 01:34:34,020
Let me be clear

1292
01:34:34,020 --> 01:34:36,820
There will be no solution in france without concentration camps

1293
01:34:37,460 --> 01:34:40,100
Absolutely no solution in france without concentration camps

1294
01:34:40,740 --> 01:34:45,540
They are going to have to take french citizens so-called french citizens

1295
01:34:46,260 --> 01:34:52,100
Who at this point are citizens of a nascent global caliphate and they're going to have to concentrate them in certain places

1296
01:34:53,300 --> 01:34:56,980
And extricate them from france. Maybe they should take algeria

1297
01:34:57,460 --> 01:35:00,660
Back and they should use it for this purpose in any case

1298
01:35:01,220 --> 01:35:07,140
Because france is constituted differently from britain and i mean that constituted in both senses of the word

1299
01:35:07,460 --> 01:35:11,380
I actually think there's some hope in france, but it's going to be extremely brutal

1300
01:35:11,780 --> 01:35:13,780
You know to constitute

1301
01:35:14,340 --> 01:35:20,420
What what may end up being the sixth french republic? It's doable though and here in this country

1302
01:35:21,860 --> 01:35:23,860
The situation is also not far gone

1303
01:35:24,420 --> 01:35:26,420
There's still hope to turn things around

1304
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:32,180
But it has to be done very soon and if it doesn't happen during a second term of trump

1305
01:35:33,220 --> 01:35:38,420
We're going to be utterly hopeless and a catastrophe will unfold which you know

1306
01:35:39,700 --> 01:35:43,380
You know, yes, he's going to come out of the bottle the camp you put back in

1307
01:35:43,780 --> 01:35:46,420
Now if we break down some of the players involved here

1308
01:35:47,220 --> 01:35:53,620
One of the organizations that's currently funding these uh protests is the open society foundation

1309
01:35:53,940 --> 01:35:59,620
You know george saris but more now his son alex who is dating huma abedin

1310
01:35:59,940 --> 01:36:05,220
Whose parents from what i understand are involved or we're involved with the muslim brotherhood

1311
01:36:05,620 --> 01:36:12,180
So what exactly is going on here and one more thing to add to that from what i understand during obama's administration

1312
01:36:12,180 --> 01:36:18,820
When hillary clinton was secretary of state they redid all the manuals having to do with counter terrorism

1313
01:36:19,140 --> 01:36:22,340
To completely scrub it of anything related to islam

1314
01:36:22,980 --> 01:36:24,980
So i'm curious what you make of this

1315
01:36:25,940 --> 01:36:32,100
Look another reason i'm so visibly irate is because i spent a decade in the iranian opposition

1316
01:36:32,740 --> 01:36:34,740
And three years in its leadership

1317
01:36:35,380 --> 01:36:37,940
We found that the democrat party in the united states

1318
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:45,300
Wanted to secure the continued existence of the islamic republic of iran pretty much at any cost and they undermine any and every effort

1319
01:36:45,940 --> 01:36:48,660
Uh of the iranian people to change this regime

1320
01:36:49,380 --> 01:36:52,980
So this is an issue in particular with the democrats in this country

1321
01:36:53,700 --> 01:37:00,100
And we can see that reflected just uh, you know in the last 48 hours with this letter that blinkin

1322
01:37:00,580 --> 01:37:02,580
ordered his people to issue

1323
01:37:03,060 --> 01:37:09,140
Expressing condolences for the death of reisi president reisi was a butcher president reisi

1324
01:37:10,420 --> 01:37:13,540
presided as a summary execution jurist

1325
01:37:14,420 --> 01:37:20,500
over the mass execution of thousands of political dissidents in iran

1326
01:37:21,060 --> 01:37:22,900
and you and people

1327
01:37:22,900 --> 01:37:26,900
Before it was even confirmed that his helicopter, you know

1328
01:37:27,860 --> 01:37:31,300
Cashed and that he had you know that he had met his demise

1329
01:37:31,540 --> 01:37:36,500
You had fireworks going off all across iranian cities that night. The iranian people were celebrating

1330
01:37:36,980 --> 01:37:38,980
Throughout the night and into the next morning

1331
01:37:39,700 --> 01:37:41,300
for the death of this

1332
01:37:41,300 --> 01:37:47,860
Butcher and meanwhile the u.s. State department issues its condolences for the death of reisi

1333
01:37:48,420 --> 01:37:50,580
Right and the u.s. State department

1334
01:37:51,540 --> 01:37:54,740
Allows the american ambassador to the united nations

1335
01:37:55,380 --> 01:38:00,820
To stand together with all the other members of the security council in a minute of silence

1336
01:38:01,620 --> 01:38:05,300
For reisi's death in the united nations security council

1337
01:38:06,260 --> 01:38:08,260
the israeli ambassador

1338
01:38:09,220 --> 01:38:14,580
Put on a fantastic spectacle the other day. What was it about a week ago when he walked up

1339
01:38:15,300 --> 01:38:17,300
to the podium of the general assembly

1340
01:38:18,260 --> 01:38:20,260
And he took the un charter

1341
01:38:20,260 --> 01:38:27,460
And he shredded it in a mini shredder right there at the podium of the general assembly after the un general assembly condemned israel

1342
01:38:29,140 --> 01:38:34,580
Okay, uh, it's gone too far. It's gone to the international criminal court

1343
01:38:35,940 --> 01:38:37,940
issuing a

1344
01:38:38,500 --> 01:38:41,140
issuing a request for arrest warrants

1345
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:46,660
For net and yahoo prime minister net and yahoo and defense minister galant

1346
01:38:47,860 --> 01:38:51,060
When at the same time this international criminal court

1347
01:38:51,940 --> 01:38:55,860
Has completely turned a blind eye to all of the other genocidal

1348
01:38:56,580 --> 01:39:03,620
political leaders in afghanistan in iraq during the years of isis in various parts of africa

1349
01:39:05,380 --> 01:39:06,980
It's an outrage

1350
01:39:06,980 --> 01:39:11,780
And we're fast approaching a situation which i depicted in my novella artemis unveiled

1351
01:39:12,340 --> 01:39:14,340
What was it two years ago?

1352
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:16,500
where israel

1353
01:39:16,900 --> 01:39:18,900
And a new iran

1354
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:21,140
Are going to wind up a war with the whole world

1355
01:39:22,260 --> 01:39:24,980
That day is coming. We are fast approaching

1356
01:39:25,780 --> 01:39:30,500
That vision of the future dark vision of the future which i articulated in that novella

1357
01:39:31,300 --> 01:39:33,300
And i'm telling you i'm particularly

1358
01:39:33,620 --> 01:39:35,620
the american people

1359
01:39:35,940 --> 01:39:37,460
need to

1360
01:39:37,460 --> 01:39:39,140
change course

1361
01:39:39,140 --> 01:39:41,140
and these uh

1362
01:39:41,140 --> 01:39:42,820
look

1363
01:39:42,820 --> 01:39:47,380
A handful a small group of enthusiastic patriots

1364
01:39:48,500 --> 01:39:51,220
Who went to our capital on january 6th?

1365
01:39:52,740 --> 01:39:57,780
With american flags see they came with american flags

1366
01:39:59,060 --> 01:40:01,060
To storm the capital

1367
01:40:01,780 --> 01:40:04,020
And they're branded as insurgents

1368
01:40:04,660 --> 01:40:07,460
Patriots who come carrying the american flag

1369
01:40:08,180 --> 01:40:10,180
To the people's house

1370
01:40:10,740 --> 01:40:12,740
Are branded as insurgents

1371
01:40:13,060 --> 01:40:15,300
And they're tried under the insurrection act

1372
01:40:15,940 --> 01:40:24,180
You know what insurrection is insurrection is when 40 campuses in our country including all the ivy league and comparable universities

1373
01:40:24,660 --> 01:40:26,420
are taken over

1374
01:40:26,420 --> 01:40:28,420
by a group

1375
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:33,860
That actually has its orders coming from a chinese front foundation

1376
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:36,500
where a foreign power

1377
01:40:36,580 --> 01:40:38,180
is

1378
01:40:38,180 --> 01:40:40,180
organizing these takeovers

1379
01:40:41,300 --> 01:40:43,940
And doing it in support of an ideology

1380
01:40:44,740 --> 01:40:47,060
Whose maxim is death to america

1381
01:40:47,620 --> 01:40:49,780
And these people are burning american flags

1382
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:53,060
Right and calling for the destruction of their own country

1383
01:40:53,540 --> 01:40:55,540
That is an insurrection

1384
01:40:55,620 --> 01:40:57,940
And these people as far as i am concerned

1385
01:40:58,980 --> 01:41:00,980
Need to be rounded up

1386
01:41:01,460 --> 01:41:07,300
And summarily tried not in civil courts because they have stripped themselves of their american citizenship

1387
01:41:07,860 --> 01:41:12,580
They need to be tried in military tribunals under conditions of martial law

1388
01:41:13,380 --> 01:41:18,260
That's what has to happen in this country under trump and if it doesn't we're fucked. It's over

1389
01:41:18,660 --> 01:41:23,380
It's over for this country and it's frankly going to be over for the west as we know it

1390
01:41:24,580 --> 01:41:27,780
So look civil war is a terrible thing

1391
01:41:28,420 --> 01:41:33,300
But unfortunately it's going to happen at this point and we need to make sure that we win it

1392
01:41:34,020 --> 01:41:36,020
Well

1393
01:41:37,220 --> 01:41:39,700
That's going to bring us to super chats right there

1394
01:41:39,700 --> 01:41:44,420
I think that you said everything that there is to say about our current situation

1395
01:41:44,900 --> 01:41:46,900
And what we're going to be

1396
01:41:47,460 --> 01:41:53,460
Expecting one quick note by the way is that the open society foundation and your source and all that

1397
01:41:54,260 --> 01:41:57,380
They despite you know, sores being jewish and whatever

1398
01:41:57,940 --> 01:42:02,180
Have no love towards israel or the west in general

1399
01:42:02,740 --> 01:42:06,020
And that is something that I think a lot of people who are watching this

1400
01:42:06,500 --> 01:42:10,500
Tend to forget they tend to lump jewish people into this

1401
01:42:10,980 --> 01:42:14,980
Whole pile where a lot of the horrible things that you're talking about right now

1402
01:42:15,460 --> 01:42:17,780
They see them as being the cause of

1403
01:42:18,420 --> 01:42:23,060
Let me add something there. Let me add something there. George Soros has

1404
01:42:24,980 --> 01:42:28,420
Ties in his youth to the romanian iron guard

1405
01:42:28,980 --> 01:42:34,420
George Soros has early affiliations to fascist right-wing groups in europe

1406
01:42:36,020 --> 01:42:41,140
Otto Scorzani in the 1970s early late 60s early 70s

1407
01:42:41,780 --> 01:42:44,740
Was doing some things with mosad in israel as well

1408
01:42:45,380 --> 01:42:48,580
Okay, there are complex business

1409
01:42:49,700 --> 01:42:51,700
And and military industrial

1410
01:42:52,260 --> 01:42:54,260
Connections here all across the world

1411
01:42:54,900 --> 01:42:58,260
The point to the fact that certain quote-unquote jews

1412
01:42:59,620 --> 01:43:01,620
Look, I know you're of the ukrainian

1413
01:43:02,420 --> 01:43:06,580
background and that you're sympathetic to the struggle of ukrainian people

1414
01:43:06,900 --> 01:43:10,740
But frankly the same thing can be said of zolinsky in terms of

1415
01:43:12,260 --> 01:43:14,260
fascist

1416
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:17,380
Ultimately anti-semitic right-wing groups

1417
01:43:17,940 --> 01:43:19,940
using certain jews

1418
01:43:20,580 --> 01:43:25,300
In order to accomplish their aims and forward their agenda

1419
01:43:25,620 --> 01:43:32,580
And here I would direct people to the research of joseph farrell, which I've quoted and cited at length in some of my books

1420
01:43:33,140 --> 01:43:35,380
Now joseph is a dr. Farrell

1421
01:43:36,180 --> 01:43:37,220
is a

1422
01:43:37,220 --> 01:43:40,660
Russian orthodox adherent, okay, so from

1423
01:43:41,220 --> 01:43:45,380
And I you know, I visited ham at his home and we had very nice conversations on so forth

1424
01:43:45,700 --> 01:43:51,780
But you know dr. Farrell essentially would consider me a satanist. Okay, so we are we are not aligned

1425
01:43:52,660 --> 01:43:54,180
spiritually

1426
01:43:54,180 --> 01:43:56,420
And ethically in many ways however

1427
01:43:57,060 --> 01:43:59,060
his research on

1428
01:43:59,540 --> 01:44:01,540
What he calls di spena

1429
01:44:01,940 --> 01:44:04,580
Is impeccable di spena or the spider

1430
01:44:06,020 --> 01:44:10,340
Nickname for odessa the the order of former ss officers

1431
01:44:10,740 --> 01:44:14,020
Which was basically constituted in 1945

1432
01:44:14,580 --> 01:44:21,060
And was part of what what we have been what we have been introduced to as operation paperclip

1433
01:44:21,940 --> 01:44:26,580
There was a lot more going on in terms of the importation of nazis

1434
01:44:27,380 --> 01:44:29,380
post 1945

1435
01:44:29,700 --> 01:44:31,700
They developed a

1436
01:44:31,860 --> 01:44:33,220
global

1437
01:44:33,220 --> 01:44:35,220
financial control system

1438
01:44:35,220 --> 01:44:41,060
And a military industrial network that ultimately has succeeded in capturing the american deep state

1439
01:44:42,020 --> 01:44:45,220
And it is these people not the jews

1440
01:44:45,940 --> 01:44:47,940
Who are ultimately controlling?

1441
01:44:49,460 --> 01:44:52,900
The kind of policy making that's been detrimental to the west

1442
01:44:53,380 --> 01:44:59,380
Including in germany where merkel led in all these migrants if you look at the tentacles

1443
01:45:01,940 --> 01:45:05,620
Around the let's just let me just say it this way around the 9 11 operation

1444
01:45:06,180 --> 01:45:08,500
They go back to institutions like deutschbank

1445
01:45:09,220 --> 01:45:12,980
The bank of germany, okay, and you had you know

1446
01:45:14,900 --> 01:45:20,580
Martin borman hitler's financial mastermind who supposedly died three different times in three different ways

1447
01:45:21,060 --> 01:45:26,900
Still writing checks through chase Manhattan bank in argentina in the 1970s

1448
01:45:28,020 --> 01:45:33,220
Go look at joseph arles research the nazi international the european union and the third way

1449
01:45:34,580 --> 01:45:37,540
The people who have undermined the west

1450
01:45:38,340 --> 01:45:39,780
through

1451
01:45:39,780 --> 01:45:41,780
mass migration

1452
01:45:42,340 --> 01:45:46,740
Social justice agendas and so on so so forth are not jews

1453
01:45:47,780 --> 01:45:49,780
They're nazis

1454
01:45:49,860 --> 01:45:51,860
And their ultimate aim

1455
01:45:51,940 --> 01:45:58,980
Is to foment a backlash. They want a right-wing reaction that they intend

1456
01:46:00,100 --> 01:46:04,900
To ensure is traditionalist in character. This is a sophisticated

1457
01:46:05,140 --> 01:46:11,620
Dialectical operation that's taking place. It's what they were always masters at welton shang's creek

1458
01:46:12,180 --> 01:46:14,020
worldview warfare

1459
01:46:14,020 --> 01:46:15,540
Okay, so

1460
01:46:15,540 --> 01:46:20,980
So that's what I have to say about george soros and his ilk is that their pawns their pawns

1461
01:46:21,860 --> 01:46:22,820
of

1462
01:46:22,820 --> 01:46:26,900
An ss elite that not only survived the end of the war

1463
01:46:27,220 --> 01:46:33,540
It went on to ultimately create a hidden power structure in this world and its aim is a traditionalist

1464
01:46:34,100 --> 01:46:38,500
neo feudal hierarchical system that's going to crush the human individual

1465
01:46:40,100 --> 01:46:44,900
And israel is a bold work against that israel and its 300 nuclear warheads

1466
01:46:46,020 --> 01:46:50,180
The only thing I could say is that uh to all the jews who are still

1467
01:46:50,740 --> 01:46:57,940
Working in you know the new york crimes or any of these you know new republic all these magazines

1468
01:46:58,820 --> 01:47:05,380
I really recommend them to stop being such idiots because I really do think that unfortunately because jews as you know

1469
01:47:05,460 --> 01:47:06,900
They live in the city

1470
01:47:06,900 --> 01:47:10,580
And you can get all kinds of jobs the jobs you end up getting

1471
01:47:11,220 --> 01:47:18,660
The ones that people end up paying the most attention to just because of how information is disseminated would be jobs in the media

1472
01:47:19,220 --> 01:47:25,060
So unfortunately you have this weird situation where the people and I wonder I do wonder if what's going on right now

1473
01:47:25,140 --> 01:47:28,100
These protests are kind of waking some of these people up to their delusions

1474
01:47:28,820 --> 01:47:34,420
That those were the people who ended up rising through the ranks who were disseminating all of this uh, you know

1475
01:47:35,140 --> 01:47:36,740
anti-western

1476
01:47:36,740 --> 01:47:38,020
bullshit

1477
01:47:38,020 --> 01:47:40,020
That uh the unfortunate

1478
01:47:40,260 --> 01:47:46,340
Effect of that is that people look up their names and they do all these 4chan infographics saying that you know

1479
01:47:46,740 --> 01:47:51,700
Jonah goldberg or whoever you know once white people to go extinct and so on and so forth

1480
01:47:52,100 --> 01:47:55,380
So I don't know like as my final question before the super chats

1481
01:47:55,780 --> 01:48:00,500
Do you see any way of remedying that because it seems like until that's remedied

1482
01:48:00,820 --> 01:48:06,020
We're going to have all these people coming out of the woodwork saying like no, they're secretly against us

1483
01:48:06,100 --> 01:48:10,420
They want to overthrow the west. No, I do. I do see a way to remedy it. I do

1484
01:48:11,380 --> 01:48:17,540
And that's that I think that the prime minister net and yahoo and and people like defense minister galant and

1485
01:48:17,780 --> 01:48:22,180
The people who are you know looking into like how october 7th could possibly have been

1486
01:48:22,580 --> 01:48:25,860
Have have happened within mosad and israeli military intelligence

1487
01:48:26,420 --> 01:48:28,420
These because you see there were also

1488
01:48:28,980 --> 01:48:30,980
But israel has been betrayed

1489
01:48:32,020 --> 01:48:34,820
Israel's been betrayed by the kinds of jews in new york that you're talking about

1490
01:48:35,380 --> 01:48:39,460
Jews in la and but israel's also been betrayed by certain jews within israel

1491
01:48:40,180 --> 01:48:44,820
And right now israel has to win this war. That's this primary objective. It has to be achieved

1492
01:48:45,460 --> 01:48:47,460
Without hesitation israel has to win this war

1493
01:48:47,940 --> 01:48:51,380
But don't think there's not going to be a reckoning within israel after this war

1494
01:48:51,700 --> 01:48:57,380
There's a lot of soul searching that's going to take place and there's a massive purge that's coming within israel

1495
01:48:57,460 --> 01:48:59,460
that's what I think I think that

1496
01:49:00,180 --> 01:49:03,780
The right kind of leadership learned a really harsh lesson

1497
01:49:04,260 --> 01:49:06,740
And they know that they have a lot of traders in their midst

1498
01:49:07,380 --> 01:49:13,140
And they're going to clean these people out because these people represent an existential threat to zionism

1499
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:19,220
They they represent an existential threat to the continued existence of a state of israel

1500
01:49:19,540 --> 01:49:23,860
All right, and I think they're going to need to be weeded out and what I also think is that

1501
01:49:24,980 --> 01:49:26,980
The right kind of zionists

1502
01:49:27,220 --> 01:49:32,660
Right people who are just looking to defend a state for people of jewish descent

1503
01:49:33,700 --> 01:49:40,260
The right kind of zionists are going to find a tremendous ally in the next regime of iran

1504
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:45,140
A regime that represents the will of the majority of iranian people who love israel

1505
01:49:45,860 --> 01:49:47,860
They love america and they love israel

1506
01:49:48,420 --> 01:49:50,260
and

1507
01:49:50,260 --> 01:49:51,460
I think that

1508
01:49:51,460 --> 01:49:58,500
The kind of intelligence and security relationship that could exist again because it existed once between sabaq wasad

1509
01:49:58,900 --> 01:50:03,620
Very close relationship to the point where they were developing nuclear weapons together. That's a whole other story

1510
01:50:04,100 --> 01:50:05,140
but

1511
01:50:05,140 --> 01:50:08,980
There will be an intelligence and security relationship between the future iranian

1512
01:50:10,900 --> 01:50:12,020
services

1513
01:50:12,020 --> 01:50:17,540
Whether they want to I I'm partial to the idea of calling it sabaq again. I actually think that's a great idea

1514
01:50:17,620 --> 01:50:19,220
What does sabaq mean?

1515
01:50:19,220 --> 01:50:21,220
Oh, it just means

1516
01:50:21,220 --> 01:50:25,220
So I was one am yet of the et alata ke shfar. It means a state

1517
01:50:26,260 --> 01:50:28,260
security and intelligence service

1518
01:50:28,420 --> 01:50:34,020
But you know, it has a horrific aura to it because you know supposedly they tortured people and

1519
01:50:34,580 --> 01:50:39,460
You know engaged in all kinds of repression. Well, who were they who were they interrogating?

1520
01:50:39,700 --> 01:50:41,540
They were interrogating

1521
01:50:41,540 --> 01:50:44,100
A bunch of islamist cockroaches

1522
01:50:44,580 --> 01:50:48,740
Who have turned women into second-class who are beating women right now?

1523
01:50:49,220 --> 01:50:53,220
For exposing their hair, right? Islamists who have completely

1524
01:50:54,580 --> 01:50:59,620
Abrogated freedom of of the press and freedom of speech for the last 45 years in iran

1525
01:51:00,740 --> 01:51:06,180
Those are the people who they were severely interrogating. They were severely interrogating communists

1526
01:51:06,740 --> 01:51:11,460
Who wound who apparently were so faithful to their marxist principles their

1527
01:51:12,340 --> 01:51:13,540
atheistic humanistic

1528
01:51:13,540 --> 01:51:19,540
Universalist marxist principles that all these fucking iranian communists lined up to support a lunatic like ayatollah chomeini

1529
01:51:20,180 --> 01:51:25,940
And to bring a bunch of islamic fundamentalists to power those were the communists being interrogated by sabaq

1530
01:51:26,820 --> 01:51:32,660
All right sabaq was actually doing its job trying to actually the shah was the one who was too much of a bleak part liberal

1531
01:51:33,140 --> 01:51:35,140
Anyway, anyway be that as it may

1532
01:51:35,540 --> 01:51:45,140
My point is that the future iranian state security and intelligence apparatus will have an excellent relationship with mosad and shin bet and and you know the israeli

1533
01:51:46,500 --> 01:51:47,780
services

1534
01:51:47,780 --> 01:51:55,780
So that the iranians i think will be able to help weed out the wrong kind of israelis and the wrong kind of jews even in the united states

1535
01:51:57,620 --> 01:52:00,660
Who are undermining the security of israel

1536
01:52:01,140 --> 01:52:05,700
You know again to reiterate what i said earlier, you know addressing the american people

1537
01:52:06,900 --> 01:52:08,340
understand

1538
01:52:08,340 --> 01:52:14,820
That the domestic political situation in america is a vital national security concern of the future iran

1539
01:52:15,220 --> 01:52:20,580
The future iran is going to find itself immediately in conflict with china in conflict with russia

1540
01:52:20,980 --> 01:52:24,820
Without a europe that it can count on because europe is being taken over by islamists

1541
01:52:25,540 --> 01:52:31,940
Right so who is going to be iran's ally well america israel principally and also america

1542
01:52:32,260 --> 01:52:37,220
So the future iranian state security apparatus cannot very well allow america

1543
01:52:38,020 --> 01:52:40,020
To be a stage for protests

1544
01:52:41,300 --> 01:52:45,460
Then mirror the ideology and discourse of the islamic republic

1545
01:52:46,340 --> 01:52:47,300
understand

1546
01:52:47,300 --> 01:52:54,100
So the domestic political situation in america is going to be a vital national security interest of the future regime of iran

1547
01:52:54,100 --> 01:52:55,700
Let me leave it at that

1548
01:52:55,700 --> 01:52:58,980
Okay, and and that includes whatever misguided jews

1549
01:52:59,060 --> 01:53:04,580
There are who are you know aligning themselves with these apologists for hamas

1550
01:53:04,740 --> 01:53:10,820
Yeah, they uh drank the kool-aid just like all these really beautiful girls that i used to have a crush on and now

1551
01:53:10,900 --> 01:53:12,660
You see their instagram uh

1552
01:53:12,660 --> 01:53:16,340
Story is all like you know pro gaza. Yeah, you know what i mean

1553
01:53:16,340 --> 01:53:19,620
It's it's it's a it's a damn shame like like the song goes

1554
01:53:20,180 --> 01:53:23,380
One last thing i would say is that you know, believe me i know

1555
01:53:23,380 --> 01:53:27,540
Yeah, uh one last thing i would say regarding israel's that i would highly recommend

1556
01:53:27,620 --> 01:53:33,380
I'm sure they're doing it already for masa to take a look at people like romana brahmovich and look at all the

1557
01:53:33,860 --> 01:53:35,620
immigrants from russia

1558
01:53:35,620 --> 01:53:40,260
To israel as far as their effect because netanyahu himself has had too

1559
01:53:40,820 --> 01:53:47,620
Chummy of a relationship with uh putin and i think that's one of the things that misguided him keep in mind how often

1560
01:53:47,860 --> 01:53:53,060
russia's government including putin himself met with representatives of hamas and iran

1561
01:53:54,100 --> 01:53:56,100
Look, um, i i uh

1562
01:53:57,540 --> 01:54:00,900
I am certainly not in favor of the conflict in ukraine

1563
01:54:02,100 --> 01:54:08,980
spiraling into a potential nuclear confrontation between nato and russia that having been said

1564
01:54:09,620 --> 01:54:12,020
As you remember from our previous conversation

1565
01:54:12,660 --> 01:54:17,620
Where vlad was also with us vlad davinson. Yeah, yes, and we were discussing october 7th

1566
01:54:18,340 --> 01:54:20,900
I i told you that i think that

1567
01:54:21,860 --> 01:54:25,620
All these russian jews in the israeli state security apparatus

1568
01:54:26,340 --> 01:54:33,540
Who have ties to the kremlin and we know there are a lot of people in mosad who do they are double agents and they work for russian intelligence as well

1569
01:54:34,100 --> 01:54:35,460
I think uh

1570
01:54:35,460 --> 01:54:39,060
Something went very wrong that day and it did involve the russians

1571
01:54:39,620 --> 01:54:46,420
Um, and it was retribution for frankly netanyahu being dragged kicked and screaming by america to support ukraine

1572
01:54:47,140 --> 01:54:51,220
Uh, but but be that as it may. Yeah, I you know, there's a case to be made that

1573
01:54:51,860 --> 01:54:57,220
Uh, israel was betrayed by russian jews who ultimately were answering to the orders of the kremlin

1574
01:54:57,940 --> 01:54:59,940
And now russia's yeah, I can also tell you

1575
01:55:00,500 --> 01:55:04,340
I'm sorry to say this to the folks who are my final i have a lot of followers who support russia

1576
01:55:04,580 --> 01:55:08,820
But I can tell you that the future regime of iran is going to be an enemy russia. There's no question

1577
01:55:09,380 --> 01:55:12,420
There's and they're right across the kast me and c and by the way

1578
01:55:13,060 --> 01:55:18,420
By the way for people who don't have a sense of history the russians took a quarter of iran's territory

1579
01:55:19,060 --> 01:55:20,260
It's they fought

1580
01:55:20,260 --> 01:55:25,700
Two significant wars with iran and they're responsible for taking a quarter of iran's territory

1581
01:55:25,860 --> 01:55:31,940
So there's a lot of bad blood there and I can well see that there's going to be a future iranian-israeli alliance

1582
01:55:32,660 --> 01:55:34,660
Even just against russia

1583
01:55:35,780 --> 01:55:42,020
Well onto uh onto super chats we go so the first super chat is uh from somebody who

1584
01:55:42,500 --> 01:55:48,020
Did it last time? Uh, but I unfortunately was not able to get to it. So um, here remind me today

1585
01:55:48,500 --> 01:55:54,340
As a reminder my question was of jason has seen the mh 370 videos

1586
01:55:54,740 --> 01:56:00,260
That's the hidden tech held by the shadow government and before uh, you respond jason once again

1587
01:56:00,420 --> 01:56:07,140
Make sure to like subscribe comment click the bell the bell is very important. Uh, anyway, uh, jason, uh, go ahead

1588
01:56:07,220 --> 01:56:14,020
I've seen it. I've heard analyses of it. Uh, I

1589
01:56:15,380 --> 01:56:17,380
Have listened to

1590
01:56:17,460 --> 01:56:19,460
intelligent people who I really respect

1591
01:56:19,540 --> 01:56:22,020
Who have uh, in some cases said they

1592
01:56:22,820 --> 01:56:27,860
They think it's legit and in other cases. Um other people who I respect equally

1593
01:56:28,420 --> 01:56:33,140
Uh have raised questions about you know, uh, the the legitimacy

1594
01:56:34,020 --> 01:56:36,020
And fidelity of that video

1595
01:56:36,100 --> 01:56:43,620
Um, whether or not that particular footage is is accurate, you know, it's it's showing these three UFOs

1596
01:56:44,340 --> 01:56:50,420
circling around mh 370 and basically creating a vortex which the airplane then disappears into

1597
01:56:50,820 --> 01:56:54,820
That's what it shows and supposedly it was leaked by a high level official

1598
01:56:55,380 --> 01:57:03,940
Um, and the footage was taken by classified satellites who were looking down at the area that the plane was transiting at the time

1599
01:57:04,900 --> 01:57:09,700
Whether or not that particular footage is legit. I think that technology exists

1600
01:57:11,940 --> 01:57:13,540
Hmm

1601
01:57:13,540 --> 01:57:15,540
Jane Dominic ten dollars

1602
01:57:16,100 --> 01:57:21,140
Questions for Jojani. Do you see any room for bacchic mania muse inspiration?

1603
01:57:21,460 --> 01:57:29,460
Jungian individuation or some form of serious promethean divinization in the future of philosophical inquiry

1604
01:57:31,620 --> 01:57:33,620
The hell do you think i'm doing

1605
01:57:34,900 --> 01:57:40,420
I mean, that's the core of my whole philosophical project. Yeah, that's pretty softball

1606
01:57:41,060 --> 01:57:43,060
Of course, I do. Yeah

1607
01:57:43,060 --> 01:57:47,620
Uh, all right moving on here. Uh, yeah, the ones that we could just answer fast. We could just answer fast

1608
01:57:48,180 --> 01:57:50,180
Austin ten bucks

1609
01:57:50,260 --> 01:57:56,020
Ethmogens have been administered in traditional cultures to aid in the development of these psychic abilities

1610
01:57:56,180 --> 01:57:59,380
Especially for individuals who struggle with the training

1611
01:57:59,940 --> 01:58:02,180
Uh, well comment any thoughts on it

1612
01:58:03,140 --> 01:58:10,420
It should be some combination thereof, you know, I mean the right drugs properly used as the Greeks called them pharma kea

1613
01:58:10,820 --> 01:58:12,420
you know, the right

1614
01:58:12,420 --> 01:58:14,420
Pharmacons properly administered

1615
01:58:15,060 --> 01:58:21,060
Um, together with various psychical training regiments are probably the way to go

1616
01:58:22,580 --> 01:58:28,180
Hmm, but that's drugs as a tool and the craft rather than as an escape

1617
01:58:28,660 --> 01:58:30,660
hmm

1618
01:58:30,660 --> 01:58:34,660
No, that's true because when it comes psychedelics, you don't want it to become a crutch

1619
01:58:35,460 --> 01:58:36,660
right

1620
01:58:36,660 --> 01:58:39,380
Or an escape form of escapism. Mm-hmm

1621
01:58:40,420 --> 01:58:43,780
Uh, cerulean valley. I don't know if this was a mistake

1622
01:58:44,660 --> 01:58:48,260
100 dollars. Thank you so much cerulean valley

1623
01:58:48,820 --> 01:58:53,860
Uh, okay. Here we go. They in quotes are more advanced in every field

1624
01:58:54,180 --> 01:59:01,620
Um, uh, you speak of ludite ism will be psychologically healthy for most inhabitants on this planet

1625
01:59:02,020 --> 01:59:05,540
You can't even astral project. It's not your choice

1626
01:59:05,940 --> 01:59:09,780
But just accept their traditionalist dominion over you

1627
01:59:10,420 --> 01:59:12,420
You will lose

1628
01:59:13,300 --> 01:59:17,300
First of all, I have astral projected second of all, uh

1629
01:59:18,260 --> 01:59:25,620
That's perfectly fine if traditionalism is going to be suitable for the majority of the planet in that case

1630
01:59:25,700 --> 01:59:33,220
I'm interested in eliminating the majority that are going to subjugate the minority of people who absolutely do not deserve to have their

1631
01:59:33,300 --> 01:59:39,380
Individuality subsumed by traditionalism. Okay. I am a radically anti-majoritarian person

1632
01:59:39,700 --> 01:59:46,420
I'm the furthest thing from a populist you can ever imagine. I am for the individual. I'm a radical individualist

1633
01:59:46,820 --> 01:59:51,700
Who's totally devoted to the defense of liberty and progress

1634
01:59:52,340 --> 01:59:53,460
so

1635
01:59:53,460 --> 01:59:59,620
Think again, okay, and I can also tell you that as I've had to incessantly repeat every time someone

1636
02:00:00,260 --> 02:00:03,700
Asks as if this is a question asks a question like this

1637
02:00:06,020 --> 02:00:08,020
That number one

1638
02:00:08,420 --> 02:00:12,900
Going back to what you asked me love about buddha, right many of our conversation number one

1639
02:00:13,780 --> 02:00:16,980
There's another class of beings opposed to the olympians

1640
02:00:17,700 --> 02:00:20,980
Or the devas namely the ashuras or the titans

1641
02:00:21,380 --> 02:00:25,060
They're in the mix here and they're very angry people. If you think i'm angry

1642
02:00:25,300 --> 02:00:31,220
You see what these people are like. This is why the buddhas depicted them as demons. I mean, they're very angry people very violent people

1643
02:00:31,780 --> 02:00:35,780
They've had nuclear wars in the past. You look at the mahabarata and the ramayana

1644
02:00:36,580 --> 02:00:39,620
and you look at uh, libyan desert glass

1645
02:00:40,260 --> 02:00:43,780
And you know various vitrified stones in south america

1646
02:00:44,260 --> 02:00:49,780
You can see the evidence for the nuclear wars between the ashuras and the devas in the distant past

1647
02:00:50,180 --> 02:00:53,700
so to begin with the ashuras are in the mix and

1648
02:00:55,540 --> 02:01:00,260
Look their policy is that they don't want to have to come in and solve the problem for us

1649
02:01:00,500 --> 02:01:03,700
They want to see some kind of human initiative and frankly

1650
02:01:04,900 --> 02:01:08,020
It's much better for us if we tried to determine

1651
02:01:08,980 --> 02:01:13,380
Our own future course and set the conditions for

1652
02:01:14,420 --> 02:01:19,380
You know securing our liberty by ourselves to the greatest extent possible

1653
02:01:19,700 --> 02:01:25,380
We don't want to be beholden to some group of titans or ashuras either. Remember prometheus is this rather

1654
02:01:26,020 --> 02:01:29,620
ambiguous trickster figure who initially betrays the titans

1655
02:01:30,020 --> 02:01:34,100
Decide with the gods and then turns on the gods to defend humanity, right?

1656
02:01:34,420 --> 02:01:39,460
So looking at it from a promethean perspective, I don't want us to be beholden to the ashuras

1657
02:01:40,020 --> 02:01:42,020
The the titans either

1658
02:01:42,020 --> 02:01:45,380
But they're in the mix and they're very powerful. They're very powerful

1659
02:01:45,620 --> 02:01:52,100
They're the reason why there's not a biosphere on mars anymore. Okay, so whoever quote, you know made this

1660
02:01:52,740 --> 02:01:53,860
Uh

1661
02:01:53,860 --> 02:02:00,340
statement is forgetting that and what's more important than that is that quite apart from the ashuras

1662
02:02:00,740 --> 02:02:06,100
You have this entity that I spent some time discussing which, you know, I come around to

1663
02:02:06,980 --> 02:02:13,940
Uh engaging with at the end of philosophy of the future this trickster this cosmic trickster and its various

1664
02:02:14,740 --> 02:02:21,300
avatars and emissaries and that force is so much more powerful than the debuts

1665
02:02:22,180 --> 02:02:26,740
And that's why when I talk about phenomenal authorization, I make the point that look

1666
02:02:26,980 --> 02:02:28,980
This trickster

1667
02:02:29,940 --> 02:02:32,980
Sees the movements of the devas

1668
02:02:34,180 --> 02:02:38,100
Not necessarily like movements of chess pieces across a chess board

1669
02:02:38,500 --> 02:02:43,700
Because the game is more like backgammon. It involves an element of chance a roll of the die

1670
02:02:44,180 --> 02:02:48,020
But it's kind of like a backgammon game except that the trickster

1671
02:02:50,180 --> 02:02:55,700
Can win but the trickster is interested in the game and the possibilities opened up by the game

1672
02:02:56,340 --> 02:03:02,500
Okay, so frankly the person who posed this who made this statement is utterly clueless

1673
02:03:03,060 --> 02:03:09,220
Hmm. Well, he thinks you're a heretic. That's the other thing. Well, I am a yeah. Well, he's right about that

1674
02:03:10,820 --> 02:03:16,980
Who I'm a Muslim. Yeah, and you can be born into any religion. I was born muslim

1675
02:03:17,140 --> 02:03:21,300
So I'm not just a heretic. I'm an apostate. He gets pretty rude over here

1676
02:03:21,300 --> 02:03:25,700
But if you'd like I can read you his five dollar chat right after the one hundred dollar one

1677
02:03:27,700 --> 02:03:29,700
Let's spend more time on somebody's

1678
02:03:30,420 --> 02:03:32,420
You know, who's

1679
02:03:32,980 --> 02:03:37,700
Yeah, yeah, the the cherry on top give other people. Yeah trial size dove

1680
02:03:38,340 --> 02:03:43,620
$10 seems to me the birth of humanity is a radically anomalous and finite event

1681
02:03:43,940 --> 02:03:49,140
With this entity working to coax as much growth potential from us before that energy dissipates

1682
02:03:50,100 --> 02:03:54,180
Say that again one more time sure lower. Okay. Here we go

1683
02:03:54,900 --> 02:03:55,940
Um

1684
02:03:55,940 --> 02:04:01,460
Seems to me the birth of humanity is radically anomalous and finite event

1685
02:04:01,860 --> 02:04:08,260
With this entity working to coax as much growth potential from us before that energy dissipates

1686
02:04:08,500 --> 02:04:22,500
It's a question of scale it goes back to when you were talking about we can imagine that there's a macrocosm that's you know

1687
02:04:23,620 --> 02:04:25,060
Has you know

1688
02:04:25,060 --> 02:04:27,620
Vast in such and such a way and there's all kinds of

1689
02:04:28,340 --> 02:04:33,460
intelligences that are potentially so far beyond ours and well, you know, you could imagine a context

1690
02:04:34,980 --> 02:04:36,980
That would render humanity

1691
02:04:38,500 --> 02:04:40,500
this relatively unexpected

1692
02:04:41,620 --> 02:04:42,820
and

1693
02:04:42,820 --> 02:04:44,820
anomalous

1694
02:04:47,060 --> 02:04:51,940
Phenomenon which this trickster is taking great pains to

1695
02:04:53,300 --> 02:04:59,620
Cultivate right and to nurture albeit, you know as a very severe mother

1696
02:05:01,620 --> 02:05:06,900
That's you could imagine that but again you're imagining a context for which there's no empirical evidence

1697
02:05:07,460 --> 02:05:10,820
And when you look at the literature of close encounters, that's not

1698
02:05:11,300 --> 02:05:14,980
Of the picture that we get you know, I don't want to repeat myself like I said earlier

1699
02:05:15,540 --> 02:05:18,580
the close encounter phenomenon suggests that actually

1700
02:05:20,100 --> 02:05:21,620
humanity

1701
02:05:21,620 --> 02:05:24,340
or the evolution of humanity

1702
02:05:24,980 --> 02:05:26,980
into a potentially

1703
02:05:26,980 --> 02:05:28,900
superhuman species

1704
02:05:28,900 --> 02:05:33,780
Is at the center of the cosmos that it's the central phenomenon of existence

1705
02:05:34,020 --> 02:05:36,020
Chester ten dollars

1706
02:05:37,540 --> 02:05:44,020
Ca, ca, that is uh, that is chester right there. Uh, great friend of the show

1707
02:05:44,660 --> 02:05:48,740
Um, next we have ashton milky way 50 dollars

1708
02:05:49,380 --> 02:05:56,340
Sorry jason, but how can you look at the Rothschild history of banking and the history of banking in general?

1709
02:05:56,660 --> 02:06:03,060
And say that the jews are not the ones controlling the system. I think you're foolish for believing in their propaganda

1710
02:06:04,260 --> 02:06:06,420
Read joseph arles books. He also has

1711
02:06:07,220 --> 02:06:09,220
Uh texts that are specifically

1712
02:06:10,180 --> 02:06:12,180
Dedicated to the history of banking

1713
02:06:12,900 --> 02:06:14,900
Like the financial vipers of venice

1714
02:06:15,700 --> 02:06:17,700
um, and

1715
02:06:17,860 --> 02:06:22,820
When you read his work on the development of the international banking system

1716
02:06:23,620 --> 02:06:28,260
In the context of his tracing the genealogy of what you might call the fourth Reich

1717
02:06:28,820 --> 02:06:30,980
This occulted Reich, which i've written about

1718
02:06:31,300 --> 02:06:33,300
You can see

1719
02:06:33,860 --> 02:06:42,820
To what extent various banking families including ones of jewish descent were assimilated and ensconced by this essentially

1720
02:06:43,540 --> 02:06:45,380
uh

1721
02:06:45,380 --> 02:06:47,860
I don't even want to call it fascist. I don't know

1722
02:06:49,140 --> 02:06:53,140
Nazi post-nazi system, right? Um

1723
02:06:53,860 --> 02:06:58,340
Joseph's work is is what you should look at if you're interested in actually understanding what's going on here

1724
02:06:59,300 --> 02:07:06,980
And so i'll just leave it at that. Hmm. That would be the same author to look at as far as um hitler being funded

1725
02:07:07,300 --> 02:07:11,940
Because it's weird like i was watching this uh gentleman on youtube named tick history

1726
02:07:12,180 --> 02:07:15,060
and he tries to make well first of all he makes the case that uh, uh,

1727
02:07:15,700 --> 02:07:19,300
Nazi germany was very socialist in how it operated

1728
02:07:19,300 --> 02:07:25,460
But the second thing is that he tries to say well hitler was not funded by any of these rich people

1729
02:07:25,460 --> 02:07:30,580
It was a very grass roots movement, you know, they raised their money from the people

1730
02:07:31,780 --> 02:07:33,780
shit

1731
02:07:34,980 --> 02:07:38,420
I mean look the thula gazelle shaft consisted of a bunch of barons and aristocrats

1732
02:07:38,580 --> 02:07:44,340
And it's the thula gazelle shaft that set up the nsdap as a as a pack as a political action committee

1733
02:07:44,500 --> 02:07:49,060
To help fight communism on the streets of germany. So we you know, we know that the

1734
02:07:49,780 --> 02:07:56,100
Planning the master mining of the rise of hitler came from very rich people with international banking connections

1735
02:07:56,820 --> 02:08:02,340
Though hitler himself was not a big fan of the uh aristocracy at least from what i understand

1736
02:08:02,900 --> 02:08:06,980
There was this a lady who i think you met as well at that event that we were at

1737
02:08:07,380 --> 02:08:10,580
Who talked about how um her father was this german aristocrat?

1738
02:08:10,740 --> 02:08:17,140
He was a general and hitler used to pin medals on him in such a way as to puncture his, uh, skin

1739
02:08:17,540 --> 02:08:21,700
And she interpreted that as being his hatred for this upper echelon

1740
02:08:23,300 --> 02:08:27,620
He was a rabble rouser who had a very specific purpose and

1741
02:08:28,340 --> 02:08:30,100
mission to fulfill

1742
02:08:30,100 --> 02:08:32,260
They used him

1743
02:08:32,260 --> 02:08:40,260
Okay, and that became abundantly clear to the sad broken man when he was put out to pasture in bariloche argentina

1744
02:08:40,660 --> 02:08:42,660
in 1946

1745
02:08:42,660 --> 02:08:49,540
Until listen hair hitler just paint your sunsets leave it to us. We've got it all under control

1746
02:08:50,100 --> 02:08:56,660
Okay, i think he lived a very sad last 20 years of his life down there in, uh, argentina

1747
02:08:57,460 --> 02:09:03,140
And it became abundantly clear to him that he had been played and used by people

1748
02:09:03,620 --> 02:09:09,380
Whose machinations he could not even begin to wrap his mind around and those people are still in control of our world today

1749
02:09:10,340 --> 02:09:11,700
Damn

1750
02:09:11,700 --> 02:09:14,500
Well, uh, we're here. We have fin brown ten dollars

1751
02:09:15,220 --> 02:09:20,180
So we have two remaining here unless anybody sends anything else. These would be the last two so fin brown

1752
02:09:20,900 --> 02:09:25,620
$10 thoughts on the concept of a live live player

1753
02:09:26,580 --> 02:09:28,580
non npc types

1754
02:09:30,180 --> 02:09:35,300
Thoughts on npc's no no no the live player so the opposite of what an npc is

1755
02:09:35,860 --> 02:09:41,540
What about what thoughts i mean out of the concept like what exactly entails a live player well in your book

1756
02:09:41,540 --> 02:09:43,220
you were writing about

1757
02:09:43,220 --> 02:09:45,060
consciousness and

1758
02:09:45,060 --> 02:09:50,020
Whether you see there being like this great asian of consciousness where people who would be more like the npc's

1759
02:09:50,420 --> 02:09:55,700
Would have less of it and people would who would be more of the players to have more of it or is it much more distinct?

1760
02:09:56,820 --> 02:09:58,820
individuality

1761
02:09:58,980 --> 02:10:00,980
Personal conscience

1762
02:10:01,300 --> 02:10:03,300
You know self reflection

1763
02:10:03,780 --> 02:10:05,780
critical thinking

1764
02:10:05,780 --> 02:10:07,780
Above all creative vision

1765
02:10:08,180 --> 02:10:12,260
Right all the things that these protesters we see in the streets today lack

1766
02:10:13,300 --> 02:10:16,820
And by the way, I just want to make one point that I neglected to make earlier

1767
02:10:17,060 --> 02:10:21,300
Is that because a lot of you know underserting people will say oh, but what about you know

1768
02:10:21,380 --> 02:10:28,100
The communists who took over columbia university in 1968 and so forth, you know on behalf of the students for a democratic society sds

1769
02:10:28,180 --> 02:10:30,420
Or let's say the activities of the weather underground

1770
02:10:31,380 --> 02:10:35,780
Completely different completely different. Look

1771
02:10:36,500 --> 02:10:41,780
Uh, you don't have to be a communist or agree with communism to understand why

1772
02:10:42,580 --> 02:10:50,820
Dropping napalm on vietnamese children was not a just war. Okay, the vietnam war was an unjust war

1773
02:10:51,300 --> 02:10:53,300
Okay, at least at least

1774
02:10:53,780 --> 02:10:58,340
One can understand a person who takes that position and protests the war

1775
02:10:58,740 --> 02:11:05,620
And also if you look at the doctrine of classic communism going back, you know to marx supposedly

1776
02:11:06,420 --> 02:11:08,420
However misguided you may think it is

1777
02:11:09,300 --> 02:11:10,820
It's ultimately

1778
02:11:10,820 --> 02:11:12,820
an aspiration for

1779
02:11:12,900 --> 02:11:16,180
liberation and enlightenment and an egalitarian

1780
02:11:16,980 --> 02:11:22,980
world society where you know women have more equal after all look the soviet union sent women into space

1781
02:11:24,020 --> 02:11:26,020
Way before we did okay

1782
02:11:26,340 --> 02:11:33,780
So there are things that you can respect about classic communism and about the communists who took over columbia university in 1968

1783
02:11:35,300 --> 02:11:40,900
The cockroaches and vermin and parasites today who have desecrated those places

1784
02:11:42,020 --> 02:11:46,900
Have also hollowed out anything that was respectable about communist ideology

1785
02:11:47,460 --> 02:11:53,220
They have in fact imploded communist ideology by aligning themselves to the most traditionalist and retarded

1786
02:11:54,180 --> 02:11:58,500
You know religious tradition on the planet namely islam

1787
02:11:59,540 --> 02:12:01,540
And by the way, this is a rerun for me

1788
02:12:01,540 --> 02:12:07,860
It's a horrific rerun because all of us who have some iranian heritage saw this happen in iran in 1978 1979

1789
02:12:08,020 --> 02:12:13,140
We're all the fucking leftists suddenly somehow forgot marx and got behind ayatollah homani and the molas

1790
02:12:13,460 --> 02:12:19,220
That's why we have an islamic republic today. It's the leftists in iran who brought the islamic republic to power

1791
02:12:19,460 --> 02:12:25,300
They were the firepower behind it. They were the guerrilla fighters who toppled the shah's regime not these turbans molas

1792
02:12:25,700 --> 02:12:31,460
It's the leftists who did it. So look, I don't know what that says. I don't I won't blame marx for it though

1793
02:12:32,580 --> 02:12:36,740
If you look back in my work, you see I actually you respect marx a great deal

1794
02:12:36,980 --> 02:12:40,580
The thing is that his followers have now come to the point where

1795
02:12:41,300 --> 02:12:46,740
Evidently, you know, they've become the the epitome of these zombie NPCs

1796
02:12:47,540 --> 02:12:51,220
And so I don't see, uh, you know a legitimate future for leftists

1797
02:12:51,700 --> 02:12:57,460
And the ussr was also supporting palestine back in the day era fat was an agent of the soviets

1798
02:12:58,420 --> 02:13:04,900
No, okay, but that's not there because the ussr was also the first and greatest supporter of the state of israel

1799
02:13:04,980 --> 02:13:06,980
That's true. Well, that's before israel

1800
02:13:07,540 --> 02:13:09,540
You could say kind of betrayed it

1801
02:13:09,540 --> 02:13:15,700
Yes, so is the soviets felt betrayed by israel because actually the soviets were the first supporters of israel

1802
02:13:16,100 --> 02:13:17,220
before

1803
02:13:17,220 --> 02:13:24,180
France and france became the second strongest supporter of israel and then united states only really started supporting israel after canadi

1804
02:13:24,980 --> 02:13:28,740
No, that's true. Yeah, you have a point there. So, uh, over here, although

1805
02:13:28,980 --> 02:13:29,860
I

1806
02:13:29,860 --> 02:13:35,380
Do remember reading that the soviets were also the ones who coined the term palestinian, but that's like going in a whole

1807
02:13:36,260 --> 02:13:41,540
Rabbit hole as far as where these terms originate from, you know, well the woman's going to turn palestinian

1808
02:13:41,540 --> 02:13:48,340
No, I mean like palestinian in the context of what happened after israel, you know, as far as like the palestinian people versus the

1809
02:13:48,900 --> 02:13:54,820
Yeah, well, no, I wouldn't I wouldn't be shocked that that came out of some soviet propaganda office. So here we have a

1810
02:13:55,860 --> 02:13:57,940
Valhulm 10 dollars

1811
02:13:57,940 --> 02:14:02,980
How does the world that results out of the niches split of humanity into ubermench and entermench?

1812
02:14:03,460 --> 02:14:04,740
Is any

1813
02:14:04,740 --> 02:14:10,420
Functionally different than what the davis have constructed with their breakaway civilization

1814
02:14:12,260 --> 02:14:21,540
Because what the davis are envisioning is a hierarchical caste society where there are different rungs of human beings in that society

1815
02:14:21,940 --> 02:14:30,340
Okay, until you get to the highest rung which is a a priestly class the brahmin whose sole purpose is to serve the davis

1816
02:14:30,580 --> 02:14:36,660
It's a caste hierarchy. What niches talking about is essentially the destruction of humanity

1817
02:14:37,780 --> 02:14:38,660
through

1818
02:14:38,660 --> 02:14:45,220
The under mention becoming a machinery of production. These aren't human beings anymore. We're not talking about human beings anymore

1819
02:14:46,100 --> 02:14:48,100
It's it's a completely

1820
02:14:48,100 --> 02:14:53,620
It and by the way, niches doesn't describe this a great length because it's right at the margin

1821
02:14:54,020 --> 02:14:57,140
Of what he can really what he's really capable of contemplating

1822
02:14:57,860 --> 02:15:02,820
In terms of how technological advancement is going to alter the human condition

1823
02:15:03,060 --> 02:15:06,100
There are a few notes on this in the will to power mainly

1824
02:15:06,660 --> 02:15:14,420
Where you see him describe how the machinery of production as he puts it is going to ensconce and transform

1825
02:15:14,740 --> 02:15:17,300
the under mention into a

1826
02:15:18,100 --> 02:15:19,860
base upon which

1827
02:15:19,860 --> 02:15:22,100
The ubermen pursue their own destinies

1828
02:15:22,740 --> 02:15:25,220
But the ubermen are not slave masters

1829
02:15:25,540 --> 02:15:31,220
The under mention are not slaves of the ubermen nicha really belabors this point niches

1830
02:15:31,460 --> 02:15:34,980
Entire ethical doctrine is a critique of slave morality

1831
02:15:35,620 --> 02:15:38,100
Right and an advocacy for a kind of

1832
02:15:38,660 --> 02:15:44,580
Morality where the individual sets his own goals and purposes and is not dependent upon

1833
02:15:45,380 --> 02:15:49,220
Basically, you know oppressing and manipulating anybody else. Yeah

1834
02:15:50,020 --> 02:15:52,740
Okay, so so it's a radically different vision

1835
02:15:53,540 --> 02:15:55,540
Actually, it's a much

1836
02:15:56,500 --> 02:16:01,700
And I've said this before it's a much harsher vision because to the extent that most people don't want to be free

1837
02:16:01,940 --> 02:16:04,500
And most people want to be cattle and most people are sheep

1838
02:16:04,900 --> 02:16:10,340
Well, then the dave of vision is much more compassionate because it accommodates that majority inside this pyramid

1839
02:16:10,660 --> 02:16:14,260
Nietzsche's vision is saying listen either evolve or you're going to be a machine

1840
02:16:16,420 --> 02:16:19,780
Next super chat over here we have uh from uh kalab

1841
02:16:20,820 --> 02:16:25,300
Your uh ten dollars your thoughts about the global loss of res publica

1842
02:16:25,860 --> 02:16:30,260
And its replacement in the internet where the public ceases to

1843
02:16:31,060 --> 02:16:37,300
Check and balance richard senates the fall of public man comes to mind

1844
02:16:42,100 --> 02:16:46,500
Look, I think that the republic first of all the republic was a noble idea

1845
02:16:47,620 --> 02:16:50,500
Especially if we take care to discern

1846
02:16:51,700 --> 02:16:53,700
um, you know

1847
02:16:54,020 --> 02:16:59,460
To to make a distinction between a republican constitutional structure and a democracy

1848
02:17:00,100 --> 02:17:07,060
The kind of republican constitutional structure that the founding fathers of the united states articulated in our constitution and our bill of rights

1849
02:17:07,860 --> 02:17:10,580
was a very noble minded

1850
02:17:11,220 --> 02:17:17,620
Uh and progressive endeavor in the proper sense of the word progressive which I entirely embrace

1851
02:17:18,580 --> 02:17:21,380
And intend to safeguard against these retarded leftists

1852
02:17:22,900 --> 02:17:28,100
But the fact of the matter is that even by the middle of the 20th century with the rise of

1853
02:17:29,860 --> 02:17:30,980
you know

1854
02:17:30,980 --> 02:17:38,420
instantaneous global banking and military industrial corporations and mega corporations and you know

1855
02:17:40,500 --> 02:17:43,620
You know supersonic air travel and so on and so forth

1856
02:17:44,580 --> 02:17:47,780
And and the and attendant global business class and

1857
02:17:49,060 --> 02:17:51,060
Such developments

1858
02:17:51,060 --> 02:17:56,900
Already rendered the republic an antiquated form of political organization. That is the case

1859
02:17:57,700 --> 02:18:00,660
Uh, it was already the case in the 1950s, frankly

1860
02:18:01,700 --> 02:18:07,380
And certainly as we approach the technological singularity, we're going to have to consider

1861
02:18:08,100 --> 02:18:14,340
A new form of political organization that safeguards the liberty and creative potential of the individual

1862
02:18:15,140 --> 02:18:17,380
um, and that replaces republics

1863
02:18:18,100 --> 02:18:23,140
And that replaces nation states as we've conceived of them thus thus far, right?

1864
02:18:24,020 --> 02:18:26,020
Now I don't want that to be any kind of world government

1865
02:18:26,500 --> 02:18:27,540
but

1866
02:18:27,540 --> 02:18:29,540
We need to come up with a a

1867
02:18:29,860 --> 02:18:33,300
A replacement for the republic that at the same time

1868
02:18:33,940 --> 02:18:41,140
In spirit safeguards what it is that let's say the bill of rights of our republic was intended to protect

1869
02:18:41,940 --> 02:18:43,940
So I don't see the

1870
02:18:44,100 --> 02:18:48,500
The obsolescence of the republic of the res publica as a necessarily

1871
02:18:49,460 --> 02:18:51,060
negative

1872
02:18:51,140 --> 02:18:53,140
Development I see it as an evolutionary

1873
02:18:53,860 --> 02:18:55,780
eventuality

1874
02:18:55,780 --> 02:18:57,620
And as far as the internet is concerned

1875
02:18:57,620 --> 02:19:03,940
I think the problem with the internet is that the worldwide web is increasingly controlled by mega corporations

1876
02:19:04,740 --> 02:19:06,100
and that

1877
02:19:06,100 --> 02:19:09,540
What we need to do is develop blockchain networks

1878
02:19:10,100 --> 02:19:15,620
That use the fundamental substrate technology of the internet in ways that

1879
02:19:16,180 --> 02:19:20,500
Are impervious to corporate and other centralized control

1880
02:19:21,940 --> 02:19:25,620
Absolutely. So here we have ashton milky way 20 dollars

1881
02:19:25,700 --> 02:19:31,780
How can we possibly prepare for the technological singularity and the coming catastrophe in the next 20 years?

1882
02:19:34,580 --> 02:19:36,580
Who is we?

1883
02:19:36,900 --> 02:19:39,540
One of the point and you've heard me say this yes, yes

1884
02:19:40,260 --> 02:19:43,300
one of the points that I I always make is that

1885
02:19:44,900 --> 02:19:48,500
Considering that we have maybe 15 maybe 20 years

1886
02:19:49,060 --> 02:19:53,620
Between us and the technological singularity at this point. I keep revising my estimate downward

1887
02:19:55,700 --> 02:19:57,700
There's no way that the world can prepare

1888
02:19:58,100 --> 02:19:59,540
There's no way

1889
02:19:59,540 --> 02:20:03,460
Simply impossible the vast majority of people

1890
02:20:04,500 --> 02:20:09,140
Who are either adherents of islam by 20 again? I repeat the statistic

1891
02:20:09,620 --> 02:20:16,500
Given current demographic trend and by the way people should remember this every time they call what's going on in gaza a genocide

1892
02:20:17,460 --> 02:20:19,460
The palestinians are arabs

1893
02:20:20,420 --> 02:20:22,420
majority of them arab muslims

1894
02:20:23,140 --> 02:20:28,900
There are 22 arab countries in the world all of which by the way refuse to take in these palestinians

1895
02:20:29,460 --> 02:20:30,900
okay

1896
02:20:30,900 --> 02:20:35,300
And beyond the arab world. There are gigantic countries like malaysia

1897
02:20:35,860 --> 02:20:37,860
indonesia pakistan

1898
02:20:38,580 --> 02:20:44,500
That are host to huge muslim populations. India has more muslims in it than pakistan

1899
02:20:44,660 --> 02:20:49,860
Okay, so we are dealing with a population bomb here

1900
02:20:51,060 --> 02:20:53,780
Which is going to result in it and by the way when you think about you know

1901
02:20:53,780 --> 02:20:56,900
These people's proposals to turn the united nations into a global democracy

1902
02:20:57,060 --> 02:21:01,700
Well, what the fuck would a global democracy be in 2075 when the majority of people on the earth are muslim?

1903
02:21:02,340 --> 02:21:06,500
So every time these morons talk about what's going on in gaza as a genocide

1904
02:21:06,740 --> 02:21:08,740
they ought to remember that a

1905
02:21:09,460 --> 02:21:14,260
muslim majority on this planet by 2075 means the genocide of

1906
02:21:14,740 --> 02:21:19,940
Every other culture on earth because we know and especially we who have an iranian heritage know

1907
02:21:20,500 --> 02:21:26,420
That what islam does is genocide other cultures the specialty of islam is the genocide of other cultures

1908
02:21:26,740 --> 02:21:32,980
And we we see it just recently in iraq with isis what they did to the Kurds

1909
02:21:33,780 --> 02:21:37,700
By the way, recently there was a story that made me absolutely incensed

1910
02:21:38,260 --> 02:21:42,180
as if you know as if there isn't enough to be incensed about story of a

1911
02:21:42,900 --> 02:21:44,900
Kurdish woman

1912
02:21:44,980 --> 02:21:48,100
Who was raped and held captive by isis in northern iraq

1913
02:21:49,220 --> 02:21:54,820
And she wrote this book and she was supposed to give a presentation about it. I believe it was in canada

1914
02:21:56,100 --> 02:21:58,100
And her book event

1915
02:21:58,340 --> 02:22:01,300
Was cancelled because they were afraid

1916
02:22:02,020 --> 02:22:04,020
It would promote islamophobia

1917
02:22:05,060 --> 02:22:09,140
So this poor woman who was tortured and raped by isis

1918
02:22:09,620 --> 02:22:16,180
Doesn't get to tell her story about what muslims are like because it might promote fear of islam

1919
02:22:16,900 --> 02:22:22,740
Just we we are living already in an orwellian 1984 world. It is as bad as that

1920
02:22:22,900 --> 02:22:29,700
Oh, all I could say is as that all I could say is that the people who are afraid of confronting these kind of things

1921
02:22:30,260 --> 02:22:32,260
Get what they deserve

1922
02:22:32,820 --> 02:22:38,740
Because if you are not afraid and you are willing to accept the consequences and fight for what you believe in

1923
02:22:39,140 --> 02:22:41,140
Yes, there's going to be pushback

1924
02:22:41,460 --> 02:22:46,740
But at least you could actually sleep at night knowing that you're not going to uh, you know

1925
02:22:46,820 --> 02:22:52,260
Be one of these uh yellow bellied cowards who just allow all of this uh to go on

1926
02:22:52,820 --> 02:22:58,580
Yeah, but to answer your question, sure, they're gonna get what's coming. So but to answer your question, the problem is this

1927
02:23:00,580 --> 02:23:02,580
In the face of the technological singularity

1928
02:23:03,620 --> 02:23:05,460
15 to 20 years from now

1929
02:23:05,540 --> 02:23:11,060
How do you expect that the world or people at large people writ large when you say that

1930
02:23:12,100 --> 02:23:14,100
Are going to prepare for the singularity

1931
02:23:15,060 --> 02:23:15,940
when

1932
02:23:15,940 --> 02:23:19,940
increasingly, uh, you know, we have a muslim majority on the planet

1933
02:23:20,660 --> 02:23:24,660
And uh, the rest of the people are either confusion chinese

1934
02:23:25,220 --> 02:23:31,140
Who are ultimately as regressive and uh inimical to change and progress

1935
02:23:31,780 --> 02:23:37,300
And we have uh, putin with 3000 nuclear warheads embracing russian orthodoxy

1936
02:23:37,620 --> 02:23:39,620
And then we see what's going on in the west

1937
02:23:40,100 --> 02:23:42,420
Where there's mass conversion to islam in europe

1938
02:23:43,060 --> 02:23:46,500
And there's american university students going around

1939
02:23:47,060 --> 02:23:48,100
uh

1940
02:23:48,100 --> 02:23:55,060
chanting death to america slogans from a fundamentalist islamic regime and and uh converting to islam

1941
02:23:55,700 --> 02:23:57,700
under the palestinian flag

1942
02:23:57,700 --> 02:23:59,700
so

1943
02:23:59,780 --> 02:24:03,620
What what world what world prepare for the technological singularity? No, no, no, no, no

1944
02:24:04,820 --> 02:24:06,820
A small minority

1945
02:24:07,220 --> 02:24:09,220
of people with promethean

1946
02:24:09,380 --> 02:24:11,380
foresight and forethought

1947
02:24:11,940 --> 02:24:14,180
Who care about preserving their own liberty

1948
02:24:14,980 --> 02:24:17,620
And maximizing their own creative potential

1949
02:24:18,260 --> 02:24:20,660
Are gonna band together as a group of rebels

1950
02:24:21,220 --> 02:24:23,780
Like the rebels who set the american revolution in motion

1951
02:24:24,340 --> 02:24:28,820
And we are gonna defend our future our future at any cost

1952
02:24:30,420 --> 02:24:32,420
Liberty or death

1953
02:24:33,700 --> 02:24:39,780
Austin ten dollars is there any chance that iran rid itself of the horrific theocracy now in place?

1954
02:24:40,900 --> 02:24:47,620
And restore its traditional empire and dignity as a great culture and civilization between east and west

1955
02:24:48,180 --> 02:24:52,740
And that's going to be like the final super chat before that cherry on top that we uh talked about but yeah

1956
02:24:53,460 --> 02:24:55,460
Of course it will happen

1957
02:24:55,460 --> 02:24:58,660
Of someone who's worked for that for many years of my life

1958
02:24:59,780 --> 02:25:02,420
I can tell you it will most certainly happen

1959
02:25:03,300 --> 02:25:04,580
but

1960
02:25:04,580 --> 02:25:07,460
There is in that process an absolutely

1961
02:25:08,500 --> 02:25:12,900
integral and indispensable role to be played by the state of israel

1962
02:25:13,540 --> 02:25:18,180
And everyone who wants to see that iran come into being has to understand

1963
02:25:19,460 --> 02:25:21,460
That it is inextricable

1964
02:25:22,420 --> 02:25:24,980
From support for zionism

1965
02:25:25,620 --> 02:25:27,620
Um

1966
02:25:27,940 --> 02:25:30,740
Lastly uh speaking of that before the cherry on top

1967
02:25:31,300 --> 02:25:37,300
Could you please tell because I know that you said it before I want to make sure that I got this because that's the one thing that I missed

1968
02:25:37,700 --> 02:25:39,700
When I was talking about um

1969
02:25:40,020 --> 02:25:42,020
Uh humab adin and the muslim brotherhood

1970
02:25:42,340 --> 02:25:47,060
What was the connection between what was going on in the obama administration back then

1971
02:25:47,620 --> 02:25:50,980
And obviously I think the biden administration is kind of a continuation of that

1972
02:25:51,460 --> 02:25:59,060
And what we're seeing right now with these protests and getting rid of the um all references to islam within the counter terrorism manuals

1973
02:26:00,900 --> 02:26:02,500
Well, I think I addressed it already

1974
02:26:02,500 --> 02:26:08,260
I told you that from my years of working in the iranian opposition where we engaged in significant lobbying activities

1975
02:26:08,660 --> 02:26:12,340
At one point I was even sitting with a member of the national security council

1976
02:26:12,900 --> 02:26:18,180
But I can tell you that the democrats very clearly have a pro islamist agenda

1977
02:26:18,660 --> 02:26:21,540
And they want to keep for example the islamic republican power in iran

1978
02:26:22,420 --> 02:26:25,620
So so what do they get for it? What's stated in that direction?

1979
02:26:26,100 --> 02:26:28,100
But what do they

1980
02:26:28,100 --> 02:26:31,940
What do they obtain by taking that kind of position at the end of the day?

1981
02:26:32,020 --> 02:26:34,900
What's their carrot at the end of the stake? Is it just money? Is it power?

1982
02:26:36,100 --> 02:26:40,260
Money and power they they get financed and they get to win elections

1983
02:26:40,660 --> 02:26:44,260
It's the same reason why they bring, you know millions of migrants into our country

1984
02:26:44,420 --> 02:26:49,860
They're trying to demographically re-engineer our country so that they can stay in power staying in power means getting more money

1985
02:26:50,340 --> 02:26:55,460
It's just a racket for these people. I mean they're corrupt. They use political office as a way to amass wealth

1986
02:26:55,540 --> 02:26:56,420
That's all it is

1987
02:26:56,420 --> 02:27:02,420
They're a mafia and they don't give a fuck about the future or our children's future, you know, that's all they are a bunch of looters

1988
02:27:03,140 --> 02:27:08,740
Uh now to uh serrillion valley who's been super chatting all of this time

1989
02:27:09,380 --> 02:27:11,380
Uh serrillion valley

1990
02:27:12,020 --> 02:27:17,700
Now you said before that you are up to hearing a super chats here, but they do get a little bit spicy

1991
02:27:18,180 --> 02:27:20,020
Towards you

1992
02:27:20,020 --> 02:27:21,540
You know, uh

1993
02:27:21,540 --> 02:27:27,300
I don't think that's a good note to end on I think that a better note to end on would be yet again for me to

1994
02:27:28,340 --> 02:27:33,700
Direct people to the american colossus not just website american colossus.org

1995
02:27:34,260 --> 02:27:38,500
But also to the american colossus substack. We have an american colossus substack

1996
02:27:39,220 --> 02:27:41,620
Uh that features a number of very interesting articles

02:27:42,340 --> 02:27:43,460

1998
02:27:43,460 --> 02:27:45,960

Well, I wouldn't say I revise my thesis. I present an alternative

2006
02:28:15,140 --> 02:28:17,700
Uh interpretation and hypothesis

2007
02:28:18,180 --> 02:28:21,140
