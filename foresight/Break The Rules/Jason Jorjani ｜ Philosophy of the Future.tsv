0	6680	We're live. Oh, okay. Good. That's fine. All right, everybody. Welcome to another episode of the Break the Rules live stream
6680	9780	I'm your host, Lev Polyakov, and we are here today
10400	12400	again with Dr.
12520	14520	Jason Reza Giorgiani
14960	18000	PhD it is a great honor as always to have you here my friend
18240	26780	We are going to be talking about your latest book Philosophy of the Future as well as talking about what's currently going on within the
26900	30260	political realm and I'm sure that there is a way that we can
30660	34320	Bring those two things together because I personally think that they are very much
34940	38220	Interrelated and of course if you guys have not read the Dr.
38220	42980	Giorgiani's books yet first of all I highly recommend you go into the description right now and
43220	49460	Get yourself a copy of the latest book as well as look at Prometheus and Atlas lovers of Sophia
49940	54460	So so many different books Iranian Leviathan the list goes up Prometheism
54460	56460	So you are going to be
57340	63940	Extremely pleased if this is your first time ever discovering Dr. Giorgiani and his wonderful work and
64420	66420	With that I first want to ask
67260	70340	Dr. Giorgiani about the Prometheus
71060	73700	Titan project however things go in with that
73940	78100	So please let us know and once again like comment subscribe
78860	83940	Super chat ten dollars minimum today and let's go for it. Dr. Giorgiani. You've got the floor
84700	87460	It's a pleasure to be on your show again Lev as always
87900	92100	So last time I think it was the last time that I was on BTR
92100	99300	I introduced the American Colossus project to build a monument to Prometheus on Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay and
100900	104820	We talked about the sculpture in general terms and we also went into
106100	110900	What I described as an NFT project at that point really it's not an NFT project
110940	119380	It's more like a digital raffle that will use NFT technology and that's going to involve a nationwide treasure hunt with clues embedded in these in these
120180	122700	Raffles and with very compelling
123380	125380	Aesthetic imagery and so on and so forth
125740	131740	So we discussed that a bit last time. I wanted to give viewers some updates regarding the Colossus project
132580	134580	Some rather significant updates
134940	140460	We are really moving we're working hard and moving at breakneck speed here on this project
140460	145180	It's definitely moving forward. We have found a sculptor
146500	150020	Fantastic sculptor who is an uber Nietzschean
150660	157220	Promethean in the spirit of his work and I think I had mentioned last time I was on that the kind of
158340	165020	Fash wave Greco-Roman type sculptures that you see as 3d renderings that are on the website of americancolossus.org
165500	172100	Right now that they're really placeholders and that the sculpture itself will be more sophisticated in terms of its aesthetics
172100	174300	I think I did touch on that well
174300	181180	You can get a much clearer sense of that now because our sculptor will be a gentleman by the name of fen de Villiers
181180	184140	And you can go to his website a fen de Villiers
184740	185940	and
185940	187780	he
187780	190100	has a fascinating idea of
190860	197300	Retracing the history of Western aesthetics within the context of an overarching style of modernism
197380	202580	So in a lot of the works that he has up on his website right now and his current sculpture portfolio
202740	206800	You can see projects that have a kind of archaic aesthetic
207580	209580	reiterated within the context of modernism
209820	215740	But as I understand it fen is interested in moving now more toward exploring classicism
216300	218740	But again within the context of modernism
218780	226540	So probably the sculpture that winds up being erected on Alcatraz will have somewhat of an art deco feel to it a kind of
227260	228780	classical modernist
228780	230780	Archeo-futuristic hybrid
230860	232700	that you know
232700	236940	One saw some examples of during the zenith of the art deco era
238060	239740	And I think that's very
239740	242540	Consonant with the spirit of Prometheus
243420	246220	Because there's a kind of you know renaissance
247340	249260	fusion of
249260	255180	Art qua craft with craft qua technology in that aesthetic in particular
255180	257780	It's also a very American aesthetic if you ask me
257780	261020	I mean some of the greatest American cities New York included of course
261700	265700	were predominantly built in the art deco style and you know
265700	270900	That was the historical moment when America wound up becoming the leading nation on the planet
271460	273060	So
273060	275060	I think that's a very positive development
275380	279300	And if you're going to listen to some of fen's interviews with various podcasters
279860	281620	You can see that
281620	283620	In terms of his worldview
283620	288820	He is the perfect man for the job. He actually has his own manifesto his own aesthetic manifesto
289380	292500	And I think in a lot of ways it dovetails with
293460	296500	With our own vision with the vision of Prometheus. I'm certainly
297460	300100	It's that's one. Yeah, it's a very interesting that
301060	302260	Fen is being a part of this
302260	305620	I remember first reading about him in men's world magazine
306100	309780	And I do see there being a convergence as well as a divergence
310180	316900	Apart as far as what you're doing and what let's say, you know bronze age pervert and people like that have been up to
318580	324260	Yes, well, look, there is a certain atmosphere which we will we will come around to discussing today, right?
324660	329700	A certain atmosphere that's been created by the left, which has gone full retard
330660	332340	and
332340	337940	that's going to necessitate a reaction to a certain extent and you know, what
338980	341140	What is necessary in order to?
342580	344580	Regain our footing and
344900	346900	Prevent a civilizational collapse
347460	351780	Maybe somewhat different from what I would believe to be ideal
352180	354420	But we're never going to get to any kind of an ideal
354820	361780	Promethean society as I might envision it if our civilization is is taken under by these leftists and social justice warriors
361780	365940	so there is a kind of a degree of reaction that's necessary and
366500	373300	You know for many reasons I think you know fend is certainly the right man for the job and and it's a positive thing that you know his
374740	376740	That he has connections with those circles
377060	382420	Because we are going to need to solicit their support and we need as broad a coalition as possible
383140	385140	to stand a chance in
385220	388340	you know, basically not just saving but but
389060	390500	but
390500	392500	resuscitating our civilization and
393140	399940	Kindling a second renaissance of the west. So that's a very positive development for the classes project, but there's another
401140	405140	Development that in some ways I see as equally positive and that's that
407060	409060	We are going to make a tv series
409700	412180	That traces the making of the colossus
413300	415620	And it's going to involve stunning visuals
416260	419940	initially 3d renderings but ultimately a tracing of the
420740	424180	process that leads to the construction of the colossus itself
424900	428580	And we found the perfect director for this tv series
428740	430740	It's a it's a series that
431060	433780	Through this director and the work that she's done
434340	439940	Will likely also have very significant high-level distribution and while I can't reveal, you know
441540	445700	The name of this person as of yet. I can say that
446420	449860	She is absolutely the perfect director for the project
450740	453300	really strong sharp woman who
454580	456580	shares a lot of our vision and
456980	461700	Who frankly is just a really cool person who I look forward to working with over the coming years
462020	467940	And I also think that it's great to you know, finally have a woman in a prominent place in this project
468580	470740	Do you see her in a way as being your uh,
471060	473060	Promethea if you will
473140	477860	Well, I don't know that, you know, she I don't know that she would want to be put in any such a position, but she's certainly
478500	482740	uh a more than competent director with a
483380	484980	deeply shared
484980	486980	vision and orientation
486980	488100	and
488180	491540	A person who I think it's going to be an absolute pleasure to work with over the coming years
491860	497380	And I will be working closely with her because she's going to basically trace the entire process and make a historical record
498500	503700	So, uh, I was uh reading and I finished your amazing latest book philosophy of the future
504180	511220	And what I noticed is that it did require me to have a certain bits of knowledge from all the other books that you've read
511540	514420	In order to in a way try and complete the puzzle
514820	517940	That is your latest one because you throw a lot of references
518020	521860	Not that people need to specifically read all your other books to enjoy this one
522180	527700	But it definitely helps to be well acquainted with what happened in the past as far as certain questions that I
528180	530180	always had in my mind as far as
530660	534100	in Iranian leviathan, whether it was the
535140	542180	um, uh, the persians, uh, the dynasty that created islam or whether it was these nephilim
542740	545780	Like that is a very interesting thing for me to, uh,
546420	553300	Digest as far as what exactly is the truth where you are playing the role of the trickster
553780	558340	And how exactly that's going to lead to the conclusions that you wanted to lead to
558580	560900	I don't know if that's a good place to start
561300	564900	But uh, let me know like where exactly you would be interested in
565860	568500	In a way, frankly, I'd say it's not a good place to start
568500	573940	I'd say it's kind of getting lost in the weeds and I would want to push back a little bit on your general characterization because
574260	580020	Yeah, you're right that in terms of some very specific questions like what you just articulated
580660	582980	It's helpful to have read some of my other works
583620	584580	but
584580	589700	That's not the main objective of philosophy of the future philosophy of the future has as its aim
590580	591540	a
591540	597140	general introduction of the reader to the fundamental concepts of my philosophical project
597780	602100	Or it can be read as a summary conclusion of my philosophical project
602580	608900	But in any case, what's most important about this book are the central ideas ideas novel ideas that i've developed
609140	614820	Like being bound for freedom spectral revolution world state of emergency phenomenal authorization
615380	619940	Uh and aero sophia. These are you know the the core of the book
620740	622740	In terms of specific
623700	630340	Theses that i've argued in various texts. Yeah, there are brief references to them here
630660	635460	And they're and the reader is also directed to the other books of mine where these
636020	642340	Theses are advanced with more detailed argumentation. So actually the book also functions as a kind of
643060	645540	Uh, like index or lexicon
646100	649540	For my entire corpus where in any given chapter
649780	655140	There are references to other books that i've written if the reader wants more detailed information
655620	658260	Regarding, you know, such and such an argument or thesis
658740	665860	But it's the conceptual structure of my philosophical work as a whole that's being really showcased by this book
666900	672260	Albeit, I also have to add that there is a rather striking conclusion to this book the last chapter
672820	674820	um is a very
675300	677140	dangerously revealing
677140	678740	document which
678740	680420	includes some
680420	682420	lengthy quotations from a
683140	685700	Journal that I wrote around about the age of
686580	688580	23 24
688660	693540	And it shows you the matrix for my entire philosophical project
695380	698740	And what what it is or who it is that really inspired it
699300	708420	As far as a phenomenal authorization goes that is what i'm primarily talking about when it comes to these various references to
709460	713860	You having certain let's say mixes of truths with noble lies
714580	719460	And i'm still trying to understand how exactly this phenomenal authorization would work
720020	723380	Uh, could you possibly guide us through that?
723460	728660	Sure, look the basic idea because I want to stay here with with you know, uh
729620	734340	Large structures and and you know general, you know themes here
735140	738020	Uh, the basic idea behind phenomenal authorization
738500	743620	Develop certain threads from out of the philosophical work of Nietzsche
744580	746100	Heidegger
746100	748100	Wittgenstein
748100	751860	Um, I'd say those are the primary ones also to an extent
751940	759860	Also to an extent it develops certain notions in the work of charles fort fort who was not a philosopher, but who had some very interesting
760980	766420	Epistemological ideas in the course of his study of the paranormal in the early 20th century
767060	771620	And and and to a lesser extent, you know the the philosophy of science of thomas kuhn
772260	774580	And of paul fair robin is also relevant here
775140	777140	But mainly coming from out of Nietzsche
777860	779860	Heidegger and wittgenstein
779860	781860	The idea is this
782420	788820	The and and by the way, heraclitus was incredibly important both to Nietzsche and to uh heidegger
789380	792020	And I would say that the ontology and and uh
792580	796580	And germinal epistemology of heraclitus is also very much in the background here, right?
796980	798980	So the idea is this that
800980	806100	The modern representationalist conception of truth in other words truth as veritas
806820	812100	Where there's an objectively existent structure of reality out there and that
812900	816660	What it means to ascertain knowledge meaning truths about things
817220	822420	Is for us to be able to construct the representational statements in our consciousness
822900	824900	That propositionally refer
825460	834020	To states of affairs in the world and are either accurate representations of those states of affairs or are inaccurate meaning their false propositions
834420	841140	Right, that's the basic conception of truth that began to be developed in the epoch of Descartes
841780	847300	Uh in large part, um as a consequence of the of Descartes dualistic ontology
848020	854980	and it ultimately culminated in uh the representational symbolic logic of like vietnam russell
855460	857460	and the early ludwig vittgenstein
857940	859940	and vittgenstein
859940	867860	Infamously deconstructed that having been the paragon of it himself in the tractatus logical philosophicus
868500	871780	vittgenstein turned on that whole school including his mentor russell
872180	877940	And he deconstructed this representationalist conception of truth in ways that oddly enough
878580	880580	Completely converged with heidegger's
881060	884340	Hermeneutics because these guys had no connection with each other whatsoever
884660	888020	They come from completely different trajectories in the history of philosophy
888340	892180	And yet they converge and how do they converge? Well, they both wind up saying that
894020	899540	Our phenomenological experience of the world in other words the way in which we experience phenomena
900100	903300	And the way in which the world has any meaning for us
904260	906260	Is a function of language
906820	912180	So it's not that there's any objective reality outside our minds and that our minds
912580	916340	ascertain truth by adequately reflecting an objective reality
916900	922420	It's that our subjectivity and what we take to be the objectivity of the world
923140	925140	our relative phenomena
926580	931620	Constructed deconstructed and reconstructed from out of how we use language
932980	938420	And when they're talking about language in this case, they mean it in the ancient greek sense of logos in other words
938820	940820	there is a tapestry of meaning
941620	946180	That is primordial in terms of our experience of phenomena in the world
947620	952420	And it's through this logos that chaos becomes cosmos
953300	955300	so the chaos that that
956260	960920	The chaos that proceeds our consciously processed experience
962260	965940	Becomes a structured array namely a cosmos
967220	969220	through logos
970100	973060	And in this relation between these three terms
974100	979460	chaos and cosmos cosmos coming to be through chaos being processed by logos
979700	981700	There's also a fourth term which is psyche
982580	984260	in other words
984260	987780	Consciousness has integral to that process which we see in quantum physics
988420	990420	and so in an interesting way
991380	995860	What verner heisenberg pointed to in his book physics and philosophy
996260	1000420	Which is one of the great, you know texts and I guess what you could call philosophy of physics
1000900	1002900	What heisenberg
1002980	1004980	Hitler's nuclear scientist
1005620	1013060	Points out in that book about quantum theory in terms of the integral role of consciousness
1013460	1015460	In constituting a structured
1016580	1020980	World from out of the chaos that is superposition on a quantum scale
1021860	1022820	and
1022820	1030340	Which which heisenberg explicitly discusses in that text with reference back to heraclitus and heraclitus is conception of logos
1030900	1033220	All of that is already implicit
1033700	1039780	In the ontology and epistemology that heidegger was developing and that bickenstein oddly enough also wound up
1040180	1047300	Arriving at by a completely different trajectory. And so i'm taking these ideas and synthesizing them and augmenting them
1048100	1049460	and
1049460	1051460	using the paranormal
1051860	1052820	as
1052820	1054660	an empirical
1054660	1056660	Let's say raw material
1056820	1058980	or convenient set of examples
1059540	1061220	to illustrate
1061220	1062420	why
1062420	1069380	The world works this way. I'm being very careful not to say why why reality, you know is this way because the whole point is that
1069620	1071620	What we take to be reality
1072180	1073380	objectively
1073380	1079460	And how we understand ourselves subjectively are co-constructed from out of this interrelationship
1079860	1081060	between
1081060	1082100	chaos
1082100	1084900	logos cosmos and psyche i
1085460	1087460	describe these four as
1088260	1090260	ontologically equa primordial
1090420	1095700	It's a term coming from heidegger equally primordial meaning like the four causes in Aristotle
1096020	1101220	None of these is more fundamental than the other they represent the kind of fourfold causality
1102500	1106500	That structures our experience of the world and so okay, so that's the basis
1107220	1109780	for understanding what phenomenal authorization is because
1110500	1112500	What that implies
1112500	1113940	is that
1113940	1115940	We live in something like a story
1116740	1119940	We live in a tapestry of meaning in an account a narrative
1120260	1123140	There is a metanarrative structure to the cosmos itself
1123860	1126980	And what that suggests is that the world can be written and rewritten
1128100	1132420	And if you look at some of the more bizarre and distressing
1133140	1137140	Paranormal phenomena that seem to involve the manipulation of timelines
1137540	1140420	Or the use of some kind of time travel technology, whether it's
1141460	1145620	purely mechanical or whether it's actually psychical like remote viewers
1146420	1151300	Going back to the past and using telekinesis to influence past events to therefore rewrite
1152500	1156900	Their presence the present that they came from right or to rewrite potential futures
1157140	1162420	Whether it's entirely mechanical technology or whether it's psychical or whether it's some psychotronic combination thereof
1163220	1166260	When you look at these kinds of things that are possible
1167780	1169780	You realize that we live in a revisible world
1170980	1175620	And it's rewritable the way that the story is rewritable now the thing though is that not everybody's an author
1176420	1179780	And not all authors have that kind of purchase on
1181540	1185460	Defining what reality is not just for themselves, but for our whole society
1185780	1190820	And so I developed this notion of people who are phenomenally authorized meaning
1191540	1192660	Um
1192660	1198500	At the diametric opposite pole of what we what we would call these days an npc a non-player character
1198980	1204260	In a kind of simulacrum in a in a theatrical space in a in a game space
1205300	1208900	On the opposite pole of of those people who are kind of like part of the
1209620	1211860	What they're the wallpaper or window dressing
1212740	1216340	You have people whose agency is such that they are actually
1216900	1220740	Engaged in defining what reality is for whole society
1221220	1222420	through their
1222420	1228900	Creative endeavors whether it's literal writing or whether it's logos in the form of artistic production or
1229220	1232180	You know cinema or music and and so on and so forth
1232660	1236500	So you have this idea that there's a relationship between
1237620	1243700	Authorship again including in all the arts all the modes of of poesis or creative production
1244580	1248260	Authorship in that sense is related to phenomena
1248900	1250900	So phenomena are
1251780	1254180	phenomenally authorized by these author
1255140	1256740	types
1256740	1261620	But then there's also a kind of authority that that represents which I argue
1262740	1268420	Far exceeds political authority or you could say is more fundamental than political authority
1268820	1275060	Where the political leaders of one or another country are relatively insignificant
1275460	1282180	Compared to the movers and shakers who define the welton shong the worldview of that
1282660	1287940	Culture who set the standard for what's even going to count as real or unreal
1288260	1291460	You know for a given people which as you mentioned in your book
1291940	1298500	Nowadays unfortunately is uh in the power of all of these social media gossipers
1299060	1303780	Who back in the day would have just been relegated to gossiping in the back of the church during sunday
1304180	1309860	And now they're the ones that seem to wheel the power and bring people into the lowest common denominator
1310340	1311460	So
1311460	1317700	I don't know if now would be a good time to talk about what that future holds because i'm still very intrigued by
1318020	1322980	What the possibilities are here of wielding this kind of authority and authorship
1323300	1326260	So whichever direction you would prefer to go to please let me know
1328660	1331780	Well, I think that you know, it's fair to say
1332740	1339700	That my philosophical project as a whole which is reflected in a really condensed and crystallized form in this book philosophy of the future
1342020	1349620	Uh owes a great deal to nichea and and where nichea did not serve as an explicit inspiration
1349940	1354180	it's consonant with a lot of what nichea was doing and and um
1355140	1361940	Uh represents a further development of the same trajectory of thought that nichea was pursuing
1362580	1369860	And nichea had this vision of what he called frankly artist tyrants or artist philosophers
1370500	1373300	Uh who would wind up defining
1374740	1379460	Life on this earth in terms that exceeded the limits of the human condition
1380340	1382340	these are his uber mention
1382660	1383860	and
1383860	1390180	He has this notion that you know, there are these the highest men of history who are great geniuses and that basically
1390980	1392980	historical development throughout
1394020	1398260	Throughout time should be seen in terms of these mountain peaks
1399300	1400660	that are each
1400660	1407220	The contributions of one or another genius and that these higher men are progenitors of the coming overmen
1407860	1409860	just as
1409940	1411940	just as the last men
1412180	1415380	Uh who are increasingly degenerate
1416580	1418580	lazy
1418580	1423860	People who are feckless and without any particular motivation people who become
1424660	1427540	Ultimately captured by the event horizon of nihilism
1428340	1432260	that these uh last men are the harbingers of
1433620	1435620	A race of untermention
1435700	1441780	Subhumans who are really no longer going to be human and we're going to wind up being integrated into a machinery of
1441940	1447140	Reduction nichea has this vision as any today when you think in terms of the pace at which
1448100	1450100	Developments are taking place in artificial intelligence
1451780	1456260	And I mean, I don't know if you've seen what gpt 4o can do, but it's actually unsettling
1457060	1458580	uh, so
1458580	1463620	Even for me who's written about this for years like the rate at which this is happening is astonishing
1463860	1466100	Well, it was showing your your past as well
1466580	1469700	Uh possible past. I mean when you were uh using it
1470660	1473300	Yeah, well, we can come to that too. I mean so
1474660	1481700	But then when you combine ai with gene editing like for example, there are stories coming out today about how
1483620	1490980	One of the biggest problems with genetic engineering throughout these years that it's that it's been uh worked on by various companies is that
1491940	1494900	A lot of genes have secondary and tertiary functions
1495540	1496820	which if you
1496820	1498100	tinker with
1498100	1502260	The primary function of the gene that it is you're trying to manipulate in a person's genome
1502580	1506740	You wind up shutting off, you know some secondary or tertiary function
1506820	1512500	You don't understand well and that's going to become a problem for the organism. It could even be potentially lethal
1513140	1519140	So it requires extremely complex mapping of the multiple functions of any particular gene
1519780	1525380	It's been very difficult for us to do that which has meant that hitherto genetic engineering has been very dangerous
1525780	1532820	Well ai has cracked it ai has now mapped all of the secondary tertiary whatever functions of every gene
1533460	1536980	And it can do an analysis of exactly, you know
1537700	1542820	What benefit and what risks there are to making a particular edit in the genome using crisper?
1543380	1548500	So these technologies are becoming increasingly convergent in ways where you could see how
1550020	1552020	the vast majority of
1552900	1556900	You know people without any particular will or motivation
1557700	1559700	aspiration without any
1560100	1564980	Capacity to think for themselves or to pursue visions in a self-directed way
1565540	1567540	they're just going to wind up
1567940	1571700	being integrated into a machinery of production and
1572580	1577060	At the very best at the very best through cybernetic technology
1578100	1579300	and
1579300	1581300	they're going to wind up serving
1581780	1583780	the purposes of a group of
1585060	1589700	As Nietzsche put it spiritual aristocrats who are renaissance men in the truest sense
1590260	1592260	renaissance men and women
1592820	1594340	who
1594340	1601700	Are visionaries who are geniuses who who have more ideas than they know what to do with and who will take these emerging technology
1601780	1606340	First of all, they'll augment themselves biologically, but then also use artificial intelligence
1607300	1609300	to actualize
1609540	1611540	astonishing visions that
1612020	1616500	Have hitherto been deemed impossible. They're going to make the impossible possible
1616980	1621320	using these singularity level technologies and that's phenomenal authorization
1622260	1624260	okay, but
1625140	1627140	You know, if we just look at the state of the world today
1627220	1633780	I think it's fair to say that that phenomenal phenomenal authorization is not going to extend to the general population. It's it's going to be
1634580	1642580	A phenomenally authorized group of individuals who fight fight for their autonomy and for their creative power and genius
1643220	1647140	You don't really see the possibility like you were talking about with zero point energy
1647620	1653700	Being able to be in anybody's backyard this same kind of AI technology where you could press a button
1653860	1656420	All of a sudden you're bigger faster smarter
1656420	1659700	You know, you become the uber mensch even though you start out as the intermensch
1659860	1663220	You don't really see the npc people as you were calling them
1663700	1666980	embrace that here's the issue left the issue is
1668500	1670500	That in some totally
1670820	1674340	unhistorical abstract hypothetical scenario
1674900	1680500	Where we didn't have all the ideological baggage that we have in the world that would be entirely possible
1681220	1687380	However, as we'll get around to discussing by the end of this conversation, you know in terms of what's going on domestically
1688100	1690100	and geopolitically
1690900	1694660	The number of retards who are subscribing to
1695860	1697220	traditionalist
1697220	1701780	regressive ideologies in the world today or to forms of leftism
1702260	1705540	That are so nihilistic and cynical that they're actually dialectically
1706340	1714180	Empowering these various forms of retardation is such that the vast majority of the world population has foreclosed its participation
1714420	1715940	in such a process
1715940	1717940	We are 10 to 20 years away
1718580	1723380	At one point I thought we were 30 years away from the singularity the rate at which AI technology is developing today
1723460	1727220	I can tell you I I don't think we're more than 10 to 15 years away from the singularity
1728260	1732100	And we just don't have any time left for these people. We don't have the time left
1732980	1735460	When you have a vast majority of people
1736500	1740980	Look, Islam is going to be the dominant religion on this planet by 2075
1741620	1743620	If current demographic trends continue
1744180	1746180	Right and then we've got
1747140	1749140	The russian orthodox
1749380	1751380	Through people like dugin
1751460	1754100	aligned with these islamic traditionalists
1755060	1759460	And then we have china financing both of them and militarily backing them
1760020	1765300	Right. I mean i'll come to this later. Yeah, it was it was discovered recently by an independent think tank
1766100	1774100	that the worst of the pro palestine protests in america where they were actually targeting infrastructure blocking roads and
1774180	1781700	Bridges and taking over university campuses. Those were funded by china through a series of false front organizations
1782180	1787620	So you've got the chinese behind these muslims and you've got the russian orthodox
1788980	1792900	Power cabal of putin and dugin also supporting them
1793380	1801460	Right and then all the leftists in europe and america the socialist parties in europe and the sjw's in the united states
1802180	1806420	Are also they're literally in some cases converting to islam on these university
1806900	1809780	Uh, palestine encampments, right? That's that's on the left and on the right
1809780	1816340	You've got people like andrew tate who's also converting young men into islam because they're very dissatisfied with the way things are going now
1816820	1820580	In europe and then in america. We have the the retards of the bible belt
1821460	1823460	Yeah
1823860	1829700	Well, there is this new movement right now. I'm sure you've heard about you know, like the uh, jesus's uh, jesus's king jesus's lord
1830020	1832020	it's their way of
1832020	1834500	reaffirming this much more of a warrior
1835060	1841380	type christianity as opposed to like the soft christianity that i'm not a big fan of either as far as you know, like the
1842020	1845700	sjw type christians that i'm sure you've seen a lot of in minhatten
1846820	1851860	Yeah, well, they're you know, just because there are nods with one another doesn't make either of them our allies
1851860	1857780	They're both enemies. They're both mortal enemies and look when you have people like steve bannon even steve bannon
1858100	1861860	Coming out and arguing that server farms should be bombed by the us air force
1863140	1868500	Then you know, what hope is there that any of these christians in the bible belt are going to
1868980	1875460	Support our continued advancement toward the technological singularity or availed themselves of the opportunity to use this technology
1875860	1879620	In order to become ubermanshin, right? I mean no that's not going to happen
1879620	1884820	They're going to band together with the russian orthodox and in some cases they're even going to band together with the moslems
1885780	1891380	In order to lead some luddite traditionalist rebellion against the advent of the singularity
1892100	1893060	well
1893060	1895940	But uh going back to how exactly this
1896980	1900340	There's some noise from the outside here. Give me one second. Sure, absolutely
1901300	1904820	Yes, so that we don't wind up with any disruption. I'll be right back sounds good
1905140	1910980	And uh while jason is away. I just want to remind everybody here if this is your first time watching break the rules
1911460	1913540	Be sure to like subscribe comment
1913780	1920660	But also check out the other videos because I have videos with thinkers like kurdus yarvin mensius moldbug
1921060	1924820	Uh jason reservoir johnny as you can see over here uber boyo
1925380	1930980	uh neil nostic informant all kinds of an amazing uh sticks hexan hammer 666
1931460	1935220	uh britney venti who uh hopefully should be coming back soon as well
1935700	1938420	So i'm also doing right now these uh
1939220	1944900	presentations these streams in uh my Manhattan studio in new york city
1945460	1950980	And what i'm planning on doing is that if you guys become patrons patreon.com slash break the rules
1951220	1957540	And if you become specifically 20 dollar patrons and you guys happen to live within the new york sydney vicinity
1958020	1961460	Then you know after making sure everything is kosher, you know
1961540	1967860	Just so we don't have people from mental institutions coming in then i would definitely love to invite you guys over to these
1968660	1970020	taped
1970020	1973860	Uh recordings with uh the various interesting guests including dr.
1973940	1977380	Giorgiani that i'm going to be having in the coming months
1977700	1984740	So once again patreon.com slash break the rules go there right now and uh you guys are going to get a lot of good stuff
1985060	1991620	Even uh if you're not in new york city, you're going to get exclusive episodes including a q&a with georgiorgiani
1992100	1997860	Which you guys could watch uh right now once again, that's patreon.com slash break the rules
1998420	2006180	Go there or be square. Anyway, uh jason we are back over here and uh, yeah, let's uh, let's keep uh, let's keep going
2006180	2007860	So as far as
2007860	2014260	What exactly are the limitations to changing and i know you don't like using the word reality
2014580	2019700	But if we're talking about overcoming the situation we're in right now with this philosophy of the future
2020180	2026420	We still have to know what the certain limitations are obviously right now. I'm not going to be able to just go through a wall
2026660	2029540	I'm not going to be able to teleport myself back in time
2030020	2033780	But what are the things that people are able to use?
2034340	2036340	Right here and right now
2036420	2041300	In order to change things things that may go beyond just i don't know just being uh
2041940	2047940	Interesting thinker and philosopher and spreading messages because obviously, you know, we all know that we can do that
2048260	2051700	But as far as going beyond that what exactly is there?
2052420	2058100	Well, let me be very practical with you. Okay, um, and also I have to say that
2058820	2063860	You have to make a caveat there in terms of what you mean by people people can you know, what can people do?
2063860	2065860	Like most people are utterly oblivious
2066100	2072180	Uh and or captivated by one of these aforementioned ideologies that are that are responsible for destroying our civilization
2072740	2077700	And so most people are not going to you know, take the initiative to do to use any
2078660	2082100	Uh extraordinary abilities to potentially
2085060	2087060	Make us uh make us uh
2087940	2092100	Uh to potentially make a better future than the one that we're headed for right now, right?
2092500	2095940	But what can people with with initiative do? Well
2097460	2102580	Look, this is a bit of a dangerous game, but remote viewing the future for example is a
2103620	2106900	Imminently possible thing. It's been done many times
2108100	2110420	And so there's a case to be made
2112580	2118420	For training oneself in remote viewing to the point that one could look around the corner
2118980	2124580	And and see some of the challenges and crises that we're going to be facing in the near future
2125060	2129380	And grasp what caused them so that we can
2130340	2131540	address
2131540	2138260	Those causes before they wind up unfolding into one or another catastrophe that we're headed toward right now
2138580	2142180	Okay, so precognitive remote viewing is a thing. It's been used for
2142900	2146420	Oh, I don't know 45 years at this point
2147300	2149620	effectively by various governments
2150260	2152260	and now by the corporate sector
2152660	2154100	and
2154100	2157060	So that's one thing that people could do is to train that ability
2157460	2160020	But see that goes back to a point that I've made
2160820	2165620	Throughout my work from the beginning from Prometheus and out were from Prometheus and Atlas onwards
2167540	2169220	Is that suppose
2169220	2171220	you're trying to remote view
2172180	2176980	The outcome of the second American civil war, which I'm increasingly convinced that we're headed into
2177940	2179940	or the outcome of the third world war
2180740	2183940	And your objective is to find out let's say whether, you know
2184580	2189140	Russia winds up in a favorable position at the end of world war three because let's say France
2189540	2192500	Leaves NATO or whatever or you're trying to find out
2193140	2195940	What kind of government exists in the United States in
2196740	2198420	2028 right
2198420	2201460	But as part of seeing that future
2202180	2206740	You also see what happens in terms of your relationship with your wife
2208100	2211380	Or you see the death of certain of your children
2214020	2218020	How will that impact your life how capable will you be of dealing with that
2218580	2221620	What changes will result in your immediate situation?
2222340	2225220	As a consequence of that so, you know, I think
2227060	2233940	Many people even those who have the initiative to go and train themselves in the use of such abilities many of those people
2234340	2240820	Are not prepared for the psychological consequences of say seeing some things in their own personal future
2241220	2243220	That might be part of
2243780	2247140	A glimpse into our social or political future
2247860	2253620	Even if they have the ability to prevent that somewhat from happening if they know about in advance in a way
2253620	2255620	It's kind of empowering too
2257060	2263620	Here's the thing about that love is that look just um looking at my own life to give you a very personal answer
2265460	2267060	If
2267060	2269700	you were if if let's say 20 years ago
2270660	2274420	I had pre-cognitively remote viewed certain things that happened
2275060	2278180	In my life particularly involving relationships with
2279220	2281220	certain individuals
2281860	2283860	I might have
2283940	2287220	At that time with the psychology that I had in the moment
2288580	2291700	Endeavored to prevent those events from taking place
2292420	2294420	or let's say certain relationships from
2294980	2297860	deteriorating in certain ways and so forth, right?
2298020	2304660	Well by doing so I would also have prevented myself from reaching the place that I'm at today
2306260	2308260	And I can say that
2309700	2311700	frankly
2312180	2314180	Looking at the big picture
2314980	2316980	and thinking
2317140	2319140	About this from the deepest level
2319940	2321940	I have no regrets
2322660	2325700	And I'm not sure that the Giorgiani of 20 years ago
2326580	2328580	would have had the insight
2329380	2332260	Or the wisdom to understand why
2333700	2335940	It was perhaps important for those things to happen
2337220	2339220	So it's a very burdensome thing
2340020	2342580	to see elements of your own future
2343700	2346200	And to think that you'll be able to handle
2347380	2351300	The question of whether or not you should act to change certain things, right?
2352660	2355060	So so it makes it very hard. It makes it very hard
2356020	2360580	You know to to expect even a small minority of people with great initiative
2361220	2362740	and motivation
2362740	2366820	To be able to train themselves in these abilities for the sake of
2367540	2368820	averting
2368820	2371540	You know catastrophes on a social or political scale
2373380	2376260	I see what you mean does it necessarily
2376900	2378420	need to
2378420	2381620	Be a cultivation of those future seeing
2382340	2383220	skills
2383220	2387140	If one goes down the path of training their concentration
2387540	2390900	Or could a person decide you know what I don't want to see the future
2391380	2394100	But I do want to be able to do certain things
2394660	2396660	That go beyond being a
2397300	2399780	Regular human being as I was before
2400100	2407220	Can people choose or is it a matter of once you start going in one direction all of a sudden everything else just opens up like a sponge
2409220	2412580	I think one. Yeah, you know, I think it's possible to choose but
2413940	2415460	But I think that
2415460	2420020	There's only a certain latitude for control there because psi phenomena in general
2420420	2422420	Are a function of the subconscious
2422820	2425620	And so and this has been a theme throughout the course of my work
2426180	2427780	including in my
2427780	2429780	fiction quote-unquote
2430340	2432340	The idea that
2433300	2436260	In order to exercise phenomenal authorization
2436340	2439300	You need to make the subconscious conscious to a certain extent
2439700	2443700	And you need to be able to project conscious will into the domain of the subconscious
2444180	2449220	So there's a certain deconstruction of the barrier between the conscious mind and the subconscious that needs to take place
2449860	2451860	and and a certain
2451940	2453460	uh
2453460	2455460	a certain
2455460	2457460	capacity to
2458900	2460900	Will
2461140	2463640	Processes that are usually subconscious
2464580	2468740	Like people do in lucid dreams. I mean dream states are subconscious states
2469300	2475380	But there's a phenomenon of lucid dreaming where people exercise willpower in dreams and it's not coincidental
2476100	2480660	That remote viewers in certain protocols are first trained in how to
2481380	2483380	uh become lucid dreamers
2484020	2489860	Is there a certain timeline that you can give to somebody who is interested in taking the plunge?
2490420	2496260	And uh acquiring these skills. How long would it usually take for someone who?
2496900	2498900	Well, would be committed to such a thing
2500260	2504500	You know, I don't have the personal expertise to to comment on that directly
2504580	2509460	But I can tell you what some of the best remote viewers have told me. I mean for example, you know
2509540	2512580	Lynn Buchanan who I had some level of connection with
2513060	2515940	um, Lynn Buchanan has said repeatedly that
2516980	2519700	uh, first of all, it's always possible to improve
2520580	2525140	But that some of the best remote viewers who he's trained, you know
2525300	2529780	He was the chief trainer for the cia dod remote viewing program for a while
2529940	2533700	so he trained all the other guys who were the best in the program and
2534580	2540020	He was of the view that uh, it really takes decades to produce an ace remote viewer
2540900	2542900	now, you know with things like ai
2543860	2546660	and neural link type psychotronic technology
2547380	2553300	And potentially genetic augmentation because actually it's been found that there are certain genetic correlates
2553780	2555780	Of high aptitude for psi
2556180	2562580	Right. So ai seems to be an ability that has a genetic basis to some extent just like
2563060	2566900	aptitude to become a virtuoso musician has genetic basis just like
2567380	2570580	Becoming an olympic class swimmer has some genetic correlate to it
2570820	2575060	Some people are going to be more or less genetically predisposed for high level of ability
2575540	2577540	in in uh in these
2577780	2584580	Various fields and the same is true with psi. It's very similar to the exercise of sports ability and the trainability of sports ability
2584660	2587540	Right. Like anyone can be trained to do it to some level
2587940	2591060	Anyone can, you know, not everyone's going to be a basketball player
2591540	2595220	No, but everyone can play basketball, but you might suck. Yeah. Yeah
2595380	2600900	So so the thing is there's a certain degree of genetic, uh, correlation and if now
2601460	2603140	We bring genetic
2603140	2608420	Engineering or gene editing into the mix and we combine it with neural link and we combine it with ai protocols
2608580	2611540	That can develop much more effective ways to learn remote viewing
2611780	2614340	Maybe you could cut that time down drastically
2614740	2618340	And it's a question of a few years rather than, you know, a decade or two
2618900	2623540	But it's it requires a significant investment of time and energy in any case. That's for sure
2623780	2628580	Do you also a last question regarding this, uh, ascendance? Do you also see a, uh,
2629460	2636020	usefulness of training the body in conjunction with the mind as far as exercises to make the body stronger
2636500	2640740	To, uh, you know, do certain tantric exercises as well to, uh,
2641140	2647060	Work on, you know, the chakras as they refer to, uh, that in the event of a danta and so on and so forth
2647940	2654900	Absolutely. I think that all of that, you know, should be part of a future Promethean society. No doubt about it. I mean, you know, uh,
2655860	2658740	I'm a philosopher where I've chosen to, you know,
2659220	2663220	Place my energy and my time in emphasis thus far at least in my life
2664100	2665540	is is, uh,
2665540	2666740	you know
2666740	2673540	Very much in line with how people like heidegger or jampolsacht or, you know, I don't know, uh
2674100	2679860	Wittgenstein lived their lives, right? I mean, we philosophers are a certain type, right? Yeah
2680580	2686820	So and then and then I have a literary dimension to me, which which, you know, gives me an affinity to people like kafka and
2687380	2689940	Uh, I don't know kamu and and and others
2690500	2694020	So I I'm that type of person. We're not going to be seeing Dr.
2694020	2698340	Giorgiani, uh, doing like a deadlifts and squats, uh, you know in the gym, uh,
2698980	2706820	Or are we or are we? Well, look, I'm at an interesting turning point in my life, frankly, because this book philosophy of the future
2707220	2709460	Represents a kind of culmination, right?
2709940	2717060	The fundamental structure of my philosophical project is complete now. That doesn't mean that I won't all of a sudden have a
2717860	2720740	shift of perspective or, you know, new ideas
2721220	2725700	Might not dawn on me and revolutionize my work in some way that happened with wittgenstein
2726100	2731940	You know, heidegger also had some dramatic developments in his later thinking. Uh, so yeah, sure. That's possible
2732420	2734820	But I am at a point of culmination
2735220	2740900	And also the colossus project represents in a in a tangible sense a significant development in my life
2740980	2747700	And probably changes of condition in my life that will afford me the opportunity to maybe spend time and energy doing some
2748180	2754340	Uh, other types of things how much it in, you know, for example, I certainly would love to go back to skiing
2754340	2756980	It was my favorite sport uh earlier in my life
2757780	2761780	And so, yeah, you know, I might I might put my energy in other directions
2761860	2763860	If I had to guess though, I would say that
2764420	2770100	If there's going to be a shift of energy and focus to some extent a lot of it will go into art and um art
2771060	2774980	Most likely in the sense of cinema or a visualization of my
2776100	2777780	literary work
2777780	2779780	That's I think very likely
2780020	2785700	Speaking of which by the way the cover for your book and the design of the book that was all you philosophy of the future
2785780	2791140	That's true. That's true. But I don't rule out. Let's say learning remote beyond. I don't rule that out at all
2793300	2796580	And you know, there's some people who I'm sure hope that that never happened
2797780	2799780	Going around in the ether
2800580	2804340	That that might be problematic for some of the vested interests in the world
2804660	2808980	But where exactly we go from here because we were just talking about
2809460	2811860	psychic abilities, but as far as
2812420	2817940	Defining reality itself as far as this destructive departure of world review warfare
2818580	2824340	When it comes to changing what exactly this whole thing we're experiencing is
2824820	2827860	I'm very fascinated by what that exactly would entail
2828260	2831940	But also what exactly is currently around us because
2832500	2838980	I do recall you were talking about how all of these galaxies and galaxy clusters and so and so forth
2839220	2845460	These are things for us to observe because we're looking out in order to see them that may be what they are
2845860	2848660	But then the question is well, where exactly does the
2849220	2852260	Real part end? Well, not real. I know you don't believe in real
2852260	2857940	But where exactly does the part that we can actually interact with it and there are other life forms there
2858260	2863060	Where does that end? Does it end on mars? Does it end on, you know, the uh word cloud?
2865540	2867540	You mean what's the edge of uh
2867780	2872500	Uh, what's the edge of phenomenal experience in this world? Yes. Yes
2875220	2879460	Well, I've thought a bit about this and I've discussed it in a couple of my books
2880580	2882580	to begin with
2882580	2884580	There are aspects of quantum theory
2885780	2887220	such as
2887220	2889220	wave particle duality
2890980	2894500	And the fact and the fact that a probability distribution on a quantum level
2895460	2903620	Never actualizes as a particle with a particular location until and unless it's been observed meaning measured by a
2904420	2906100	sentient
2906100	2907220	observer
2907220	2911620	And I I think that the people who push back against that, you know, that was the position of Niles Bohr
2912020	2916260	and uh, Werner Heisenberg and all the great, uh, quantum physicists in the
2917220	2922820	Early years and I think that these people reductionist materialists who are trying to push back against that and say that
2923220	2927300	Wave collapses can take place without sentient observers are trading in a bunch of nonsense
2927540	2936100	They invent hidden variables and string theories and all this other bullshit to claim that there are deterministic processes that underlie
2937380	2938420	the
2938420	2940020	the
2940020	2942260	That underlie the probabilistic
2943060	2950420	Uh quality of quantum phenomena, and I I don't there's no empirical evidence for that all of these are
2950900	2952020	Uh
2952020	2954660	purely speculative mathematical formalisms
2955540	2958820	Okay, that are just intended to give these people a sense of psychological security
2959060	2962900	There was a sorry to interrupt. There was also a physicist who said that it was the
2963700	2965700	I getting hit by
2966260	2970180	Something that caused this change to occur as opposed to observation itself
2971860	2977940	Yeah, well, that's moronic because the I is a structure made up of quantum particles ultimately just as the brain is
2978180	2983700	So what's causing the wave collapse, right? I mean quantum particles aren't causing other quantum part
2984740	2986740	Quantum particles aren't causing wave
2987380	2989380	Distributions to collapse into particles
2989940	2994420	An observer is doing that and so you just can't get consciousness from out of the mix there
2994740	2998180	You cannot you know extricate the psyche from
2998900	3002660	The cosmos as it's manifesting through logos
3003540	3007220	Out of chaos psyche is an inextricable element in this process here
3007460	3012660	But anyway, what I was going to say was that there are aspects of quantum theory like this, you know
3013380	3019540	Wave article duality or rather the fact that everything is only a probability distribution until it's observed
3020180	3023620	Which is similar to what we call conditional rendering in
3024260	3025540	video game
3025540	3032020	Programming where you don't render something that's not being observed by any one or another player in the game
3032420	3034420	Because it's just in elegant
3034580	3036820	And by the way, I have a silent conversation about this the other day
3038180	3040180	um
3040180	3041860	Where look
3041860	3043460	Someone might
3043460	3047860	Think that the reason for that is that there's a limited amount of energy and processing power
3049460	3051460	But that's not necessarily the case
3051940	3053940	If you're designing
3054420	3056100	a game
3056100	3058100	You might just
3058100	3062500	Employ conditional rendering because it would be in elegant not to do so
3062820	3067460	I mean like when you're building a stage set for a theatrical production, right?
3067940	3069940	And there's there has to be a house
3070340	3072340	on the on the set
3072740	3075540	What moron goes and builds a complete living room?
3077780	3080340	That the audience is never going to see any of the actors
3080900	3085380	Enter into right you don't do that. That's not the way it's method acting jason. That's what that is
3085460	3088900	You know, you got to get full immersion into but yeah, I understand what you're saying
3089220	3093860	Good method actors wouldn't actually even do that to get into the role. But in any case, yes
3094740	3096740	So I just think it's a question of elegance
3096900	3097700	but
3097700	3104020	features of quantum theory like that or quantum entanglement where you know, if you interact with
3104900	3110580	You take two particles that have had interaction with one another and you do a measurement on one of them
3111060	3115700	It actually affects the other one that's now moved to a discrete location
3116260	3118260	And so these two particles appear to be
3118900	3126820	Entangled in a way where anything that affects one of them causes a change in the other one. Well, there's also a process like that
3127620	3128740	in
3128740	3130020	the
3130020	3132180	coordinated change of pixels
3132820	3133940	in the
3133940	3137860	Rendering of a video game where certain pixels are coded to basically
3138500	3141220	Change simultaneously change their state simultaneously
3141780	3146500	And so there are these various features that appear similar to programming code
3147780	3149780	In the design of simulacra
3150420	3154580	And then there are other things that are even more bizarre like we've discussed in another episode
3155140	3158260	That the number 26 keeps popping up at different scales
3158980	3162180	In the cosmos whether it's in terms of the distance between
3162580	3167060	You know the or the diameter of the moon or you know the distance between
3168020	3177940	Our solar system and the center of the galaxy or the time that it takes for our solar system to circumnavigate the galaxy
3179380	3186580	These are all multiples of the number 26 for some reason. Well, that doesn't make any sense in a in a
3187860	3189860	physical cosmos the way that
3190100	3192020	reductionist materialists think about
3192100	3198420	You know the the universe that they imagine us to be living in nor for that matter does the efficacy of zodiacal astrology
3198660	3201060	Which is something I've touched on in numerous works of mine
3201380	3204180	The fact that there's good scientific evidence for example
3204740	3209220	The work of michelle gaughan showing that people do going to career paths
3209700	3216260	Influenced by you know the position of the stars at the time of their or position of the at least the planets at the time of their birth
3216580	3223060	Well, that suggests that we're living in a kind of symbol system that the cosmos is informational rather than physical in nature
3223460	3224820	That we're in fact
3224820	3230100	Inside of an information processing system of some kind. So, yeah, you know, you can wonder then
3230500	3233380	What's the size of the information processing system, you know
3234100	3240500	Is it are we in something like what's depicted in dark city? Is that what's going on here? You know, how
3241140	3244740	How uh, what's the scale of the matrix that we're inside of?
3244980	3248660	Well, the one counter that I can think of giving
3249540	3254580	To you about that is the idea of the macrocosm and microcosm where
3255220	3257220	I can imagine there being
3257300	3263700	Certain processes that are going on that are greater than us and in comparison to which we're like the cells inside of the mind
3264100	3268500	And I can imagine this going up like some kind of a russian matryoshka doll
3269060	3274420	Where there could be like certain higher consciousnesses of you know, uh, planets
3274500	3278020	Or stars or galaxies like it never ends now
3278500	3281460	I'm not saying that this is something that I'm that attached to
3281940	3288020	But it is interesting just to see like how certain patterns exist in nature both in the small and in the high end
3288180	3293140	Like when people observe galaxies, for instance, that makes me think those galaxies can't all be fake, you know
3293220	3297220	There must be like some bigger process at work here that we're just not aware of
3298180	3300180	I'll tell you why I disagree with you
3300740	3303460	I can imagine what you're saying very well
3304580	3306580	And it's very intriguing
3306660	3310100	and in some way I would like that to be true because
3311220	3318100	You know the vast or the cosmos is the more interesting that the evolutionary development possibilities are for all of the
3318820	3323060	Organisms in it ourselves included. However, the reason why I
3324580	3327700	First of all, there's no empirical evidence that what you're saying is true
3328260	3333460	We don't have empirical evidence of that the empirical evidence that we do have of intelligence
3334420	3336420	That's higher than ours
3337140	3339140	Suggest that actually
3339700	3341380	Maybe sadly
3341380	3343380	We're incredibly important
3344180	3348980	If you look at the close encounter phenomenon, which I've written an entire book about and which I've mentioned
3349060	3351300	I've discussed significantly in several other of my books
3352180	3356180	Including a bit in philosophy of the future. If you look at the close encounter phenomenon
3358100	3361300	Let's put these Nordics aside for a minute, right these these
3362260	3366980	People who look like SS officers flying around in their, you know, mercury thorium
3367460	3369620	Saucers, right muscle down blonde women
3370260	3372660	Yeah, I mean and they're they're real
3374340	3377380	There was real as you and I are these are people and you know
3378980	3385140	They don't I I think they have very deleterious intentions for the near future of our world society
3385380	3387380	But let's put them aside for the moment
3388340	3391060	Because I think that actually as I've argued in various books of mine
3391140	3394340	They're as terrified of this other thing that I'm about to discuss
3394900	3402500	As some of our government officials are and this other thing this trickster that seems to be able to produce
3403380	3406260	polymorphous phenomena of all kinds
3406980	3409940	And that has access to people's bedrooms in the middle of the night
3410500	3412500	And that sometimes abducts their children
3413140	3415140	And it takes genetic material from them
3415620	3422900	And they can shape shift into any number of shamanic forms often drawing from the symbolism of owls and mantids and so forth
3423540	3426180	Right this entity which I discuss at length
3426900	3430180	in chapter seven of closer encounters and which I come back to
3431140	3433700	Contemplating at the end of philosophy of the future
3435540	3439700	This entity seems awfully interested in human individuals
3440500	3442500	We are not irrelevant
3442580	3444820	This thing has tremendous intelligence
3445700	3447700	It is superior to humanity
3449380	3451620	It's probably capable of destroying humanity
3452500	3454500	It certainly has taken apart
3454980	3457700	human civilizations of global scale before
3458340	3460500	This is how Atlantis was destroyed ultimately
3462900	3464740	And
3464740	3468100	This entity seems incredibly interested in human individuals
3468980	3470980	We are not at all like
3471860	3478980	Termites or ants or whatever to this thing every time I hear someone like Michio Kaku say that or any one of these people
3479060	3481060	Avi Loeb or whatever
3481460	3487540	It's really aggravating to me because the empirical evidence from close encounters doesn't support that at all
3488340	3494340	This entity sends emissaries and avatars to interact with us in incredibly intimate ways
3494660	3498100	And follows human individuals throughout their entire lives gets
3498820	3501620	Generationally involved with their offspring
3502260	3505060	It is it is deeply and intimately engaging
3505940	3508500	The human community and it has an agenda
3509380	3513540	Which whatever else you want to say about that agenda or speculate about it
3514100	3519460	Clearly sees the human being as central and of vital importance to its
3520260	3522100	project for the future
3522100	3525860	So that's why I I don't really agree with you that
3526580	3532100	Whatever the forms of intelligence are that are way beyond us and that are operating on a cosmic scale
3532500	3536340	We actually seem to be incredibly important to them which suggests that we're not actually
3536820	3538340	All that's separate from them
3538340	3544980	There's not such a huge gulf between us and them and when you think about the the technological singularity and the transformative potential that it has
3545220	3548340	That actually makes a lot of sense. We may be very close
3549460	3550900	to
3550900	3552420	uh
3552420	3558980	A transformation and mutation of our form of life that gives us parity with this
3559940	3561940	entity
3562180	3564100	I guess the only
3564100	3567780	Rebutal I would give to that is the idea that this entity
3568340	3569540	May exist
3569540	3574740	But there could be also other entities that are beyond that that we don't know and again. I have no proof
3575300	3579860	For yeah, but there's no evidence for that lab. I mean and look I am as I've said to you before
3580420	3587540	Uh in our previous conversations and as is abundantly clear from my philosophical work. I'm a radical empiricist
3588180	3597540	I'm a radical empiricist. I believe in you know, uh developing ontological and epistemological ideas
3598100	3600100	uh that are
3600100	3606740	Consonant with phenomena that we can experience and observe and that we can you know
3607300	3613060	tangibly make some sense out of and and doing so in ways that afford us opportunities for tangible
3614340	3616340	technological development
3616420	3618420	And and you know productive artistic
3620260	3626180	Endeavors so I'm very much a radical empiricist and why do you say it's uh one
3626820	3629620	Entity though as opposed to a multiplicity of entities
3630180	3631860	that
3631860	3633860	Work in a similar fashion
3634980	3636980	It is a multiplicity of entities
3637380	3641060	But when you really, you know, the devil is in the details
3641780	3643460	quite literally
3643460	3646500	And when you look at the details of some of these close encounters
3648100	3653700	You have to come away with the conclusion that there is some kind of
3655860	3657620	Uh, how can I put it?
3657620	3661460	I don't want to use the term high of mind because it's it's not
3662100	3665220	Something like the borg that we're dealing with. It is not a
3665940	3667940	collective intelligence
3668020	3670020	or a kind of um
3670180	3672180	Uh organic
3672820	3677700	Unity that subsumes the individual the way that the borg
3678260	3683620	Uh assimilates and extinguishes the individuality of the people who are
3684180	3688260	Assimilated by the collective. That's not what we're dealing with. In fact
3690020	3691380	This
3691380	3696660	Super organism appears to want to encourage individuation and differentiation
3697060	3699860	For the sake of maximizing creative potential
3700900	3705780	So I don't want to call it a hive mind. Okay, but it appears that these entities
3707380	3713380	Are operating in tandem in a way that suggests the functioning of some higher
3713620	3715620	Organizing intelligence
3715620	3717220	albeit
3717220	3719220	Very finite
3719220	3723380	Intelligence is certainly not anything like an omniscient or omnipotent god
3724580	3726580	Well in the buddhism
3726580	3732260	The value that you're giving towards human beings is in a way echoed when they talk about human beings
3732820	3735780	A rebirth within that realm is the best of all
3736020	3742260	Obviously you disagree with the direction the buddhas end up going to but their reasoning is when you're in the realm of the
3742900	3744900	Higher end gods or the jealous gods
3745460	3749940	You're always going to be a lot more raptured in having all this power to deal with
3750260	3753940	Same thing when you're in the realm of the hell beings or the hungry ghosts
3754260	3758260	So I don't know if that is a concept that is close to you as well
3758500	3763540	Like that reason for human beings being so special even if you go in a different direction with it
3764340	3768260	Actually, yes, I would say so and you know someday we should do an entire show just on
3768980	3770980	what I think of buddhism because
3771860	3773860	I've said before, you know the
3773940	3776100	On an ontological and epistemological level
3776100	3783220	there's actually a lot of overlap between my work and the thought of gotama and nagarjuna and some of the serious, you know
3783860	3788420	thinkers in the history of the buddhidharma from the beginning and
3789220	3791220	you're right that
3791300	3796180	In a certain way what i'm saying about this entity's interest in humanity is
3797220	3798980	consonant with
3798980	3800980	Gotama's valuation
3801620	3806100	Of the human community over that of both the devas and the ashuras
3806820	3809460	You know gotama recognized rightly
3810180	3812180	That I mean, you know just recognized right?
3812180	3818020	He was he was a reincarnation of someone who had lived in deva realms previously
3818500	3826260	And he was familiar with the ashura realms the realms of what we call in in a west western tradition the olympians and the titans
3827300	3828820	and
3828980	3832500	He knew based on personal memory and amnesis
3833620	3835620	that
3838420	3846660	There is more possibility for personal development and the achievement of insight in the human realm than there is in these other
3847780	3849540	worlds
3849540	3854260	Uh, and I think this entity feels the same way, but the difference is
3854980	3857220	that gotama thought that
3858100	3862100	total enlightenment ultimately meant the extinguishing of individuality
3862740	3867220	and he has a nihilistic view of suffering as
3867780	3869780	having no
3869860	3871300	ultimate
3871300	3874580	purpose that you know suffering is futile
3875140	3878420	And that what we should aim at is the extinguishing of suffering
3878980	3881620	Whereas this entity I think very much
3882420	3884180	Or rather I should say
3884180	3889780	Nietzsche very much shares the the outlook of this entity, which is that suffering is
3890580	3893780	Absolutely indispensable to any creative endeavor
3894500	3896500	Uh, and that the great creators
3897620	3898820	need
3898820	3901380	suffering as part of you know the
3902980	3908260	Generative process that they act as conduits for in this world
3908740	3912180	Right, and you can see that very much for example at the core of the myth of prometheus
3912500	3919860	There's tremendous tragic suffering in the myth of prometheus, which Nietzsche discusses in the birth of tragedy specifically right prometheus as this
3921140	3925380	Tragic image of human aspiration and as the first uh mask
3925860	3927940	um in greek theater, so
3928980	3930100	so
3930100	3932660	The tragic life affirming view
3934580	3936100	Of Nietzsche
3936100	3939380	Is much more in line with how this entity
3940180	3941620	sees
3941620	3943300	human evolution
3943300	3945860	Than gotama's nihilistic will
3946580	3949620	To end suffering by extinguishing individuality
3950980	3956900	Before we proceed onwards. There is also the uh roodolph steiner view, which I see as being related
3957220	3961940	When he talked about how when you would observe a plant or a tree
3962340	3968500	Or anything in your vicinity in the way you're giving life to it and that reminds me of what you're talking about this
3969060	3974180	Generating informational computational system that we're in where our
3974980	3980660	Looking out at something in a way does give more life to it than it may have originally had
3980900	3989460	Because we're imbuing whatever we're looking at maybe including another person or including whatever we would consider to be a god of sorts
3989700	3994580	We're imbuing that with the power it did not originally have before we uh looked at it
3995380	3997140	Or before we thought about it
3997220	4002180	Yeah, the yeah look steiner has any number of very interesting insights here and there
4002580	4008100	And and he was a very innovative thinker in some ways and particularly when it comes to like applied fields
4008260	4013780	He was a polymath, you know who developed innovative educational techniques and
4014420	4018420	I don't know botany and agricultural methods and all kinds of interesting things
4018900	4023060	But the uh essential problem with steiner is that he's a strange sort of gnostic
4023540	4026260	Who has a basically dualistic ontology?
4026500	4031380	And this is something that i'm trying to deconstruct in my work with my concept of the spectral revolution
4031860	4038500	This idea that you know, they're for steiner. There's this transcendental realm, which you know is uh
4039220	4042900	Sort of presided over by lucifer and then there's this purely
4043860	4049220	materialistic realm which is controlled by ahriman and that the human experience is kind of a
4049940	4052660	Middle ground between these polarities, right?
4053540	4056980	I deconstruct that kind of dualism just as niche does
4057540	4062100	And uh, I think there's only one world. There's the world of our phenomenal experience
4062660	4068420	And you know what we frame as the spiritual versus the physical is a question again of
4069060	4076740	Linguistic structures the conditioned consciousness and that's set in place filters for our perception and our processing of our experience
4076980	4082180	Our experience of a singular world of experience. I mean our experience of a singular world
4082900	4087380	Which you know, the greeks called fuses going back to our quite as nature as it were
4088020	4090740	But within that world we would also have let's say
4091300	4094820	Certain places that people would only be able to observe
4095620	4101380	During the in-between state of uh, you know the afterlife. I guess you could say so
4102020	4107220	Similarly, we could have like with the japanese buddhas. They have this conception of pure land buddhism
4107380	4112260	Which is like this whole other realm that you can go into and like that'll meditate all day or whatever
4112660	4116580	So i'm not sure exactly as far as the amount of
4117220	4122580	Real estate that we have to work with here including like going back in time that you were talking about as well
4123220	4124740	You know, how
4124740	4130180	How much is there to explore how much is there to uncover or is it pretty much like
4130740	4134660	The earth and however we keep going, you know expanding beyond that
4135300	4137380	Look, I think there's a lot of real estate again, though
4137380	4141140	Let me emphasize the fact that it's it's a question of filters
4142020	4144020	You know when people die
4146660	4148660	Filters are removed
4149700	4158020	Filters that are integral to this particular form this construction that we take to be the physical human body
4159220	4163700	Filters are removed and other dimensions of experience become perceivable
4164420	4169620	It's not that there's another world. We don't go into the other side after we die. Okay, this is these are
4170820	4178740	Dangerous delusions that are being propagated today as part of a discourse that I think ultimately is going to be used to implement
4180100	4186260	traditionalism and kind of neo feudal subjugation of humanity under a sort of kingdom of heaven
4187380	4188980	and you know
4189060	4191460	I think that it's important to acknowledge first of all
4191940	4199460	That there's a singular realm of experience and that our capacity to perceive various dimensions of it is a question of what filters are operating
4199860	4203860	Now drugs can remove certain of those filters like for example DMT
4204260	4208500	Giving us access to these realms where there are apparently these machine elves
4208900	4212740	But in the same DMT spaces, there are also these reptilians who rape women
4213140	4216580	Okay, so my issue with what you said about the pure land
4216900	4221940	Hmm is that so far as I've heard in the contemporary
4222980	4226340	uh realm of research on altered states of consciousness
4226980	4231780	Nobody has come back and given us a report about the buddhist pure land as far as I'm aware
4232180	4236900	Now, of course, there are buddhist writings where these monks claim, you know to have connected with that realm
4237140	4241380	But you know, there's a lot to psychological projection. I mean you can you can really like really
4242340	4244340	Imagine yourself in a different milieu
4245060	4251060	With vivid clarity basically put yourself into a lucid dream while you're meditating. That's one thing
4251380	4253380	But in terms of uh, you know
4253460	4259700	Phenomenological realms of experience that could be shared by other people the way that I think the DMT space can be
4261860	4267700	I don't see anything like the pure land. I don't see any and I'm making this point very deliberately because uh,
4268100	4275140	I wanted to be impressed upon the listener that there's nowhere to escape to that doesn't involve conflict and suffering
4275700	4278340	The DMT realm involves terrifying shit
4279220	4284580	Any, you know, honest authentic account of that makes it very clear that it is not a safe place to be
4285300	4287300	Okay, so
4287300	4291700	Uh, I think that again, you know, this whole notion
4293460	4297220	That we should seek an enlightenment that involves
4298020	4300580	ultimate peace tranquility and harmony
4301700	4306660	And eventually also the effacing of our ego and the annihilation of our individuality
4307380	4309380	Is completely misguided
4309540	4312980	And it's the most sophisticated form of nihilism
4313380	4319300	Nietzsche saw this by the way. He said look at least I respect buddhism because its form of nihilism is more sophisticated
4319540	4324740	Than that of christianity, right? If you're going to be a nihilist be a buddhist not a christian, right? So
4325700	4330100	Uh, my work very much flies in the face of that kind of nihilism
4330900	4333060	Well, uh, speaking of effacing the ego
4333460	4337540	I think now would be a good time to get to the kind of effacing that's going on right now
4338180	4343460	with the uh, palestine protests going on in the new york city and uh, all over
4344180	4350900	And the general trend that I mean we talked about this before the convergence in a way that i'm seeing of the ultra left
4351380	4357060	and uh, certain elements of the uh, further right when it comes to wanting to embrace this kind of
4358420	4364660	Traditionalism, but this kind of like almost like third worldist type of traditionalism where a lot of those protesters
4364740	4371060	You know, they have no problem with china. They have no problem with uh, you know, whatever's going on in africa in the middle east
4371300	4376180	They have a big problem with these, uh, you know, 18th 17th century
4376660	4382820	Statues and monuments, you know to uh, western civilization. That's what they want to get rid of
4383380	4387380	So where exactly do you see this going right now?
4387860	4390020	Uh, jason, you've uh, well got the floor. Yeah
4392820	4394820	Look, there's so much that I want to say about this
4394900	4401780	I kind of don't even know where to begin and uh, you know, you know, because we were trying to organize a show some time ago weeks ago
4402580	4403700	um
4403700	4406660	That I really didn't want to talk about this subject public
4406660	4409300	I really tried not to say anything about this publicly
4409620	4414260	Because we're involved in some very positive optimistic work with the colossus project
4414820	4416820	and you know, I want to uh
4417780	4423460	I want to do as much as I can to make sure that that moves forward
4424580	4428180	Expeditiously and triumphantly that having been said
4428340	4434580	It's just gone too far. It's gone way too far
4435140	4439780	So you mentioned pulling down of statues, right back in the summer of of george floyd
4440740	4442740	The summer of george floyd summer of love
4443300	4448180	Yes in 2020, right. I love how these fuckers who were, you know, uh
4449620	4457460	Desecrating our war memorials and want to pull down the statues of our founders also do instagram posts where you know, it's all about love
4457700	4460420	It's all about love man. That's all it matters and the world is love
4460660	4466500	And then they go and they burn the american flag or they raise the palestinian flag higher than the american flag on flag polls
4466820	4473860	Right, and then they go and they desecrate, you know war memorials to uh, you know, uh, world war one heroes in this country
4474260	4477140	And burn american flags of the but no, it's all about love
4477780	4482660	right, uh, anyway, um, what I was going to say was that back in the summer of george floyd
4483220	4488020	We saw them starting to pull down all these statues. So the founders of our country including
4489300	4495140	This great sculpture of theodore roosevelt that was on the steps of the museum of natural history in new york
4495380	4497380	There's a place that was dear to my heart from childhood
4499300	4501300	And um
4503220	4508740	They didn't even care whether the the founders were slave owners or not they pulled down statues of abraham lincoln
4509620	4512180	Back in the summer of george. So that summer
4512660	4517140	With you know, what happened in minneapolis? What happened in portland the whole chas
4517700	4519700	encampment and so on and so forth, right
4520660	4522660	That was a watershed moment
4523380	4525380	And I founded prometheism
4526020	4530100	In response to that if you look at when prometheism was founded july 4th
4530900	4533620	2020 what was the context that was the context?
4534260	4541300	Okay, so that was a watershed moment. We're at another turning point now. Okay. We are at another
4541860	4543300	uh
4543300	4546260	Rubicon crossing of the rubicon moment right now
4548900	4550900	Where
4552500	4554500	Let me take this angle
4554820	4556820	where
4556820	4558580	slogans
4558580	4560580	That were devised
4561380	4564100	By ayatollah homini in iran
4565300	4566500	during
4566500	4570180	The hostage crisis while american hostages were being held in terron
4571380	4574420	Ayatollah homini and his fellow molas
4575780	4578420	Came up with these slogans like death to america
4579780	4584260	Which are now being chanted on the campuses and the streets of american cities
4584740	4591780	And in some cases we literally see agents of the islamic republic coming and setting up seminars to teach americans
4591940	4597860	How to chant not just death to america in english, but marg bar america in persia literally
4598340	4600340	Teaching them how to pronounce this enchantment
4601940	4603940	And these same people
4604580	4606580	Are burning american flags
4607940	4610260	And they're passing out leaflets saying
4611620	4615380	The freedom of palestine means death to america
4616660	4618340	Right
4618340	4621620	Self-described anarchists self-described communists
4622820	4626820	Who are supporting an organization namely hamas
4628100	4630260	Who they characterize as freedom fighters?
4631460	4638580	But who are actually radical fundamentalist adherents of a religion that endorses slavery
4639780	4643220	That endorses the enslavement of women
4644500	4648180	And their total degradation as second or third class citizens
4649220	4652900	And the religion that violently conquered and genocided
4654100	4660820	Other cultures in the world and deprived them of any freedom of religion or freedom of conscience or freedom of expression
4661700	4665460	Self-described communists and anarchists who
4666100	4673940	Whether or not we agree with their ideology at least were supposedly advocates for freedom and liberation
4674500	4679300	Right and we're supposedly struggling against capitalism because it was too oppressive
4680340	4687700	Right and that it was uh too much of a constraint on the human individual and that it didn't go far enough
4687780	4693780	Let's say in liberating women these same communists and anarchists are now supporting the most regressive
4694500	4696500	traditionalist ideology on the planet
4696740	4698900	Which is being spearheaded by hamas
4700900	4702900	What the fuck is going on here?
4704420	4709940	Right and meanwhile you have in europe for example, we saw what a week ago. I think it was in germany
4711540	4715860	Mass protests. I mean math tens of thousands. Where did these people come from?
4716820	4718820	Who let these people into europe?
4719700	4724580	Oh anglo-merkel, right? I remember now, right 2013 2014
4726020	4731860	Yeah, well the the chickens come home to roost at this point tens of thousands of people are marching in germany
4732260	4735140	demanding an islamic caliphate replace the german government
4736020	4740900	So that's going on in europe where we literally have muslim armies on the street
4741540	4743540	demand and then in britain
4743540	4745540	islamic parties
4745540	4747940	allied with leftists are winning elections
4748740	4750580	left and right
4750580	4752740	And they're using their political power
4753300	4759300	To completely strip the british citizen of all their fundamental freedoms like we saw happen in scotland in particular
4759540	4765860	And ireland's having kind of identity crisis where on the one hand ireland traditionally, you know with the ira and such
4766180	4771460	We're supporting palestine, but now they're also having this influx of these migrants that are coming in
4771780	4773860	They want to it's straight out of lord of the rings
4773940	4778500	They want to tear down this beautiful ancient tree in order to build a migrant center
4778500	4781540	And now there's this war that's going on between the
4782260	4784900	irish people who live there and the people that want to tear it down
4785380	4788420	So i don't know what's going on specifically with those people
4788500	4791860	I mean thankfully a lot of the irish people are standing up for themselves right now
4792420	4797620	But yeah, they're also supporting palestine. They're also supporting palestine. What kind of sense does that make, you know?
4797940	4800820	That's very strange order irish. It's a disgrace
4802020	4804020	I think it's utterly disgraceful
4804660	4806660	you know like
4806980	4808980	For fuck's sake, okay israel
4810020	4812020	was a secular
4812260	4813940	Progressive country
4813940	4815940	Which has demonstrated
4816260	4824660	tremendous capacity in contribution to technological science, which has fostered the arts a society where
4826020	4828020	women are
4828020	4832580	Respected to the point where the defense of the nation is also entrusted to them
4833220	4840980	A society that from the earliest days when the kibbutz movement formed the substrate of israeli society
4841380	4844260	Was based on radical egalitarianism
4845140	4846740	okay
4846740	4851700	And a society that has always enshrined and protected freedom of speech freedom of the press
4852260	4859780	Right and and yeah, and all the what we consider to be sacred and fundamental rights of the human individual on the one hand
4859940	4864420	You have that society by the way a society that includes many israeli arabs
4865700	4867700	Christians drues
4867700	4869140	drues
4869140	4870980	at eight at the left
4870980	4872980	Samaritans first society
4873540	4879140	Okay, uh one devoted to the protection of the individual one devoted to uh, you know
4879780	4881780	The equality of women
4882100	4884100	and one that has
4884660	4886660	contributed
4886900	4889700	With tremendous disproportionate power
4890260	4892900	To the advancement of science and technology
4893380	4896660	Okay, um, but the problem is that they're like the adult in the room
4896660	4902420	They're like the logical adult and the kids are like, you know, fuck you dad. I don't have to listen to you
4902820	4906020	It seems like it's that kind of relationship that's going on where people
4906580	4912020	Protesters against netanyahu the protesters against him, but in general just the anti-israel feeling
4912260	4914260	I think a lot of it comes from
4914420	4920900	Maybe israel is not dianesean enough to put it a certain way because people who are looking at israel are just seeing
4920980	4922420	You know these very
4922420	4925300	Logical people who are trying to explain themselves
4925700	4929940	Meanwhile people want to burn things down and cause all this chaos
4930260	4932500	I don't know if you've thought about it in that direction
4932580	4936100	But at least from people who I've spoken with they kind of see israel
4936180	4939860	I know this is very beneath you, but they see israel as cringe
4940180	4945860	You know that they don't see that kind of fire in israel's belly that would be a commanding force
4946260	4951940	And maybe that's why we have all these people online who are also going against israel just from an optics perspective
4953540	4956020	Well, maybe you're right israel might not be dianesean enough
4957220	4961140	Dianesis is an incredibly violent symbol. So maybe israel should be a lot more violent
4961380	4966420	I would be absolutely in favor of that. I think this should be a lot more commanding. There might be something to what you're saying
4966660	4968980	no, there really might be something to what you're saying, but
4969940	4976180	Who is holding israel back? Well, now we know who's holding israel back because guess what it just came out
4976900	4978900	that the united states
4979380	4981380	The administration of joe biden
4982260	4987700	Sent the representative to negotiate with the islamic republic of iran in oman
4988660	4989620	Oh, man
4989620	4997220	Okay, and the deputy foreign minister of iran was the one present at those negotiations and guess what the subject of discussion was
4997860	4999860	Bringing an end to the war in gaza
5000340	5002500	By changing the government in israel
5003220	5006020	So here's israel since october 7th
5006820	5012580	rightly aiming for regime change in iran, which would be a tremendous favor to the iranian people
5012820	5021540	And meanwhile the united states instead of helping israel to foment regime change in iran or at least not standing in the way of israel
5022020	5027860	The united states is secretly plotting with a regime whose slogan and maxim is death to america
5028420	5031380	In order to do what to change the government of israel
5032900	5037220	Before we get deeper into this. I just want to say that about a year ago
5037700	5043540	I was at a party in the in the hamptons, you know the far far east there of long island
5043940	5049220	And I met a guy who was introduced to me by a friend as being part of masad
5050100	5056900	Okay, and I told this guy the what you recommended, which is that israel should go into um
5057300	5062180	Rather than gaza, you know should go into iran should decimate, uh, you know the government buildings
5062180	5065140	But leave the nukes alone and the masad guy said
5065780	5070420	Lev you're absolutely right. We should do this, but we can't because america won't let us
5071860	5079060	In order to corroborate that let me also tell you what someone very well positioned with a lot of connections to the israeli government told me
5079460	5083940	Which is that after october 7th like, you know on october 8th. Yeah
5084740	5087780	You remember how long it took israel to go into gaza, right? Yeah
5088420	5092100	It was long we were wait for weeks. We were wait. What what is this operation going to take place?
5092420	5097460	You know why because actually netanyahu didn't want to go into gaza because netanyahu knew
5098180	5102580	What the optics of this were going to be like netanyahu wanted to bomb iran
5103140	5107300	He wanted to bomb the islamic republic out of existence rightfully so because
5108020	5116740	Who's controlling the tentacles of this octopus? That's hamas and that's hezbollah and the houthis of yemen and you know the the various uh
5117700	5125460	Militias in iraq that are against israel obviously the regime in tehran so israel wanted to go after iran
5126660	5130740	The united states sent those two aircraft carriers into the Mediterranean
5131380	5136020	Not to support israel, but to intimidate and threaten israel
5136660	5140260	I know this for a fact what they told the israelis was here
5140900	5144340	Here are these two aircraft carriers to help defend you
5145300	5148900	But if you attack iran, we will publicly withdraw these carriers
5149300	5152100	Sending a signal to the iranians that we don't have your back anymore
5152900	5154900	okay, so
5154980	5156980	This is horrendous
5157540	5162340	especially when you have masses of leftists on the streets in america
5163780	5166740	And having taken over tens of our campuses
5167700	5169700	chanting slogans
5169700	5171700	That were designed in tehran
5172660	5179700	When you have masses of people on the streets of america chanting death to america while burning american flags and desecrating american
5180340	5182900	war memorials and at the same time
5183460	5184740	you're
5184740	5186740	doing back room deals
5187620	5189620	with the islamic republic of iran
5191380	5194340	There is no higher form of treason than that
5195460	5198020	That these protests were allowed to continue
5198820	5202500	For what is it now two months for two months?
5202580	5207700	We saw these campuses be taken out including by the way the campus of colombia university
5209140	5214020	Was a sacred place to me. There is a monument to athena there
5215860	5220580	That to me has always made that place the campus of athena campus in the roman sense
5220580	5227140	You know the word campus actually comes from the roman term for sacred precincts like the campus of mars
5227780	5229780	In rome in ancient rome
5229780	5232500	And to me that place was always the campus of athena. I used to go there
5233060	5240900	You know in the wee hours of the morning before people showed up and just walk the colonnade there and silently contemplate and
5241540	5243540	Pay my respects to athena
5244820	5247460	They desecrated that place they literally held
5248180	5250980	ceremonies converting american students to islam
5251780	5256980	Under the banner of the pro-palestine movement on the campus of colombia university in the shadow of athena
5257220	5260100	They literally put a banner around athena
5262100	5264900	Renaming that place the people's university of palestine
5265460	5271220	They excluded jews from the campus at colombia at yale at any number of other universities
5272260	5274260	They formed human chains
5274660	5282340	Backed by the security forces on the campus to prevent jewish students and jewish professors from entering the campus
5283300	5285300	But there are from what i understand also
5285540	5290500	Leftist jews who are a part of the protest as has always been in history
5290580	5297940	Like people always love referring to like barbara learner specter or any of these idiots that are talking about you know wanting to destroy
5298420	5301540	Europe and my whole point is that you're going to have jews
5301860	5304740	Who are going to have bad ideas as well as good ideas?
5304980	5308980	And those are going to be the jews that people end up paying attention to and unfortunately right now
5308980	5313140	I'm sure that there are some jewish students who are so self-hating
5313460	5319140	And who have this romance having to do with you know freeing palestine and all that that they're also going to join the cause
5320180	5324740	Well, if I were in mosad right now, I would find a way to start eliminating these people
5324980	5332260	I mean they represent an existential threat to israel. Well, I've always said I've always said this that israel will never
5332580	5334980	Be defeated by any foreign enemy
5335780	5340500	If israel is ever defeated one day, it will be defeated by traders from within
5341380	5346580	People within israel will defeat israel israel can never be defeated by any foreign enemy
5346820	5350180	That country has 300 nuclear warheads
5350740	5358020	And by the way that arsenal stands between islam and its ambition for the conquest of the west
5358820	5363140	Never forget that never forget those 300 israeli nukes will be used
5363700	5370100	Before europe is conquered by islam. Okay, so look, but my point is this
5370900	5374100	that when you have on the one hand these kinds of
5375780	5378260	rabidly anti-american protests taking place
5378900	5381540	On these campuses and in the streets of american cities
5382180	5387860	Desecrating war memorials and so forth burning the american flag raising the flag of palestine higher than the american flag
5388420	5389940	all the while
5389940	5391940	chanting death to america
5392100	5394100	and at the same time
5394260	5401140	us government officials are doing back room deals with the islamic republic to undercut israel
5402820	5408820	I don't know what worse form of treason we could see in our country than that
5409700	5416100	Okay, and so the to me the ultimate red line has already been crossed and as an iranian american
5416580	5418980	Look, I was born here. Okay, but
5420740	5428660	I know a lot of other iranian americans foremost my fiance who spent 13 years living in the fucking islamic republic
5429220	5430740	I can tell you
5430740	5434180	What it's like for iranian americans who fled that regime
5435060	5436660	to come here
5436660	5439540	Looking for a place where individual liberty is honored
5439780	5445220	And to hear the same slogan that they had to live with in iran
5445700	5451700	Mark that on recall death to america being chanted by american youth here on the streets of our cities
5452660	5454660	the iranian youth today
5455460	5458580	70 percent of iran is under the age of 30 iran
5459220	5465140	May have many problems, but the natalist problem is not one of them. It's a very youthful vigorous population
5465860	5472260	70 percent of the country's under the age of 30 and the iranian youth are undoubtedly the most pro-american population
5472660	5476740	On the planet. Okay out of time when anti-americanism is on the rise
5478500	5483780	It's undoubtedly the case that the most solid future ally of america
5485460	5488180	Is the iranian nation? Okay
5488420	5495060	But what is a travesty is that the average iranian youth today the average
5495700	5497700	Iranian in their 20s or 30s today
5498660	5503940	Cares more about american culture and has a better appreciation of america's history
5504660	5506660	than american youth do
5507300	5511300	And i'm i'm warning you people right i'm just giving issuing a general warning
5512180	5517620	This is not going to go to a good place. This is not going to go to a good place. Iran is a country
5518660	5523860	That has been conquered by greeks, romans, arabs
5524980	5526820	turks
5526820	5528820	and mongols
5529460	5530980	It suffered
5530980	5532980	genocidal conquests
5533060	5535060	at the hands of foreign enemies
5535540	5537540	and it came back
5537540	5539540	five times
5539540	5541860	Not just as a country as an empire
5542500	5544020	five times
5544020	5546020	Okay, iran will rise again
5548180	5550180	The people of america
5550180	5556340	I don't i don't even want to use the term united states anymore because this fucking regime that calls itself the united states government
5556740	5559300	Is a treasonous criminal mafia
5560260	5562260	To which no one should pay taxes by the way
5562900	5565140	It is a treasonous criminal mafia
5565700	5570900	That does not represent the interests of americans, but the people of america should be very careful
5571940	5574340	To get this situation under control soon
5574900	5576420	and to
5577380	5580260	Eliminate these vermin
5581140	5587860	Who have stripped themselves of their american citizenship by conducting themselves in this manner that we've seen over the past two months
5588340	5590340	otherwise
5590820	5592820	If iran rises again
5593540	5599700	And we have a population in iran that respects american culture and american history more than
5600820	5602820	american youth do
5603460	5607140	Something very bad is going to happen that i hope i never had lived to see
5607700	5610020	Okay, i'm telling you right now well if we can uh
5611060	5613220	Europe is fucked europe is fucked
5613780	5617460	All right, uh look at germany look at britain france
5617460	5620580	I have some hope for but let me be very frank with you
5621140	5629540	That right the latest figures that i've seen show 25 of the urban population of france is is living under sharia
5630500	5635380	There are sharia no-go zones in stance where uh french
5636180	5638420	The french justice system no longer applies
5638980	5642900	And and france has the highest birth rate by the way as well in europe of muslims
5642980	5646100	Yeah, well, yeah, that's of the children of migrants
5646340	5653700	Okay, and so look the figures in france are are extremely grim. It looks like about 25 of france
5654900	5655780	is
5655780	5657060	gone
5657060	5662100	Okay has been subsumed by basically the the fifth column of the caliphate
5662740	5665540	Uh, but i actually think there's some hope for france
5666020	5671540	I think that if national front comes back in 2027 there is some hope for france. However
5672420	5674020	Let me be clear
5674020	5676820	There will be no solution in france without concentration camps
5677460	5680100	Absolutely no solution in france without concentration camps
5680740	5685540	They are going to have to take french citizens so-called french citizens
5686260	5692100	Who at this point are citizens of a nascent global caliphate and they're going to have to concentrate them in certain places
5693300	5696980	And extricate them from france. Maybe they should take algeria
5697460	5700660	Back and they should use it for this purpose in any case
5701220	5707140	Because france is constituted differently from britain and i mean that constituted in both senses of the word
5707460	5711380	I actually think there's some hope in france, but it's going to be extremely brutal
5711780	5713780	You know to constitute
5714340	5720420	What what may end up being the sixth french republic? It's doable though and here in this country
5721860	5723860	The situation is also not far gone
5724420	5726420	There's still hope to turn things around
5726500	5732180	But it has to be done very soon and if it doesn't happen during a second term of trump
5733220	5738420	We're going to be utterly hopeless and a catastrophe will unfold which you know
5739700	5743380	You know, yes, he's going to come out of the bottle the camp you put back in
5743780	5746420	Now if we break down some of the players involved here
5747220	5753620	One of the organizations that's currently funding these uh protests is the open society foundation
5753940	5759620	You know george saris but more now his son alex who is dating huma abedin
5759940	5765220	Whose parents from what i understand are involved or we're involved with the muslim brotherhood
5765620	5772180	So what exactly is going on here and one more thing to add to that from what i understand during obama's administration
5772180	5778820	When hillary clinton was secretary of state they redid all the manuals having to do with counter terrorism
5779140	5782340	To completely scrub it of anything related to islam
5782980	5784980	So i'm curious what you make of this
5785940	5792100	Look another reason i'm so visibly irate is because i spent a decade in the iranian opposition
5792740	5794740	And three years in its leadership
5795380	5797940	We found that the democrat party in the united states
5798500	5805300	Wanted to secure the continued existence of the islamic republic of iran pretty much at any cost and they undermine any and every effort
5805940	5808660	Uh of the iranian people to change this regime
5809380	5812980	So this is an issue in particular with the democrats in this country
5813700	5820100	And we can see that reflected just uh, you know in the last 48 hours with this letter that blinkin
5820580	5822580	ordered his people to issue
5823060	5829140	Expressing condolences for the death of reisi president reisi was a butcher president reisi
5830420	5833540	presided as a summary execution jurist
5834420	5840500	over the mass execution of thousands of political dissidents in iran
5841060	5842900	and you and people
5842900	5846900	Before it was even confirmed that his helicopter, you know
5847860	5851300	Cashed and that he had you know that he had met his demise
5851540	5856500	You had fireworks going off all across iranian cities that night. The iranian people were celebrating
5856980	5858980	Throughout the night and into the next morning
5859700	5861300	for the death of this
5861300	5867860	Butcher and meanwhile the u.s. State department issues its condolences for the death of reisi
5868420	5870580	Right and the u.s. State department
5871540	5874740	Allows the american ambassador to the united nations
5875380	5880820	To stand together with all the other members of the security council in a minute of silence
5881620	5885300	For reisi's death in the united nations security council
5886260	5888260	the israeli ambassador
5889220	5894580	Put on a fantastic spectacle the other day. What was it about a week ago when he walked up
5895300	5897300	to the podium of the general assembly
5898260	5900260	And he took the un charter
5900260	5907460	And he shredded it in a mini shredder right there at the podium of the general assembly after the un general assembly condemned israel
5909140	5914580	Okay, uh, it's gone too far. It's gone to the international criminal court
5915940	5917940	issuing a
5918500	5921140	issuing a request for arrest warrants
5922500	5926660	For net and yahoo prime minister net and yahoo and defense minister galant
5927860	5931060	When at the same time this international criminal court
5931940	5935860	Has completely turned a blind eye to all of the other genocidal
5936580	5943620	political leaders in afghanistan in iraq during the years of isis in various parts of africa
5945380	5946980	It's an outrage
5946980	5951780	And we're fast approaching a situation which i depicted in my novella artemis unveiled
5952340	5954340	What was it two years ago?
5954500	5956500	where israel
5956900	5958900	And a new iran
5958900	5961140	Are going to wind up a war with the whole world
5962260	5964980	That day is coming. We are fast approaching
5965780	5970500	That vision of the future dark vision of the future which i articulated in that novella
5971300	5973300	And i'm telling you i'm particularly
5973620	5975620	the american people
5975940	5977460	need to
5977460	5979140	change course
5979140	5981140	and these uh
5981140	5982820	look
5982820	5987380	A handful a small group of enthusiastic patriots
5988500	5991220	Who went to our capital on january 6th?
5992740	5997780	With american flags see they came with american flags
5999060	6001060	To storm the capital
6001780	6004020	And they're branded as insurgents
6004660	6007460	Patriots who come carrying the american flag
6008180	6010180	To the people's house
6010740	6012740	Are branded as insurgents
6013060	6015300	And they're tried under the insurrection act
6015940	6024180	You know what insurrection is insurrection is when 40 campuses in our country including all the ivy league and comparable universities
6024660	6026420	are taken over
6026420	6028420	by a group
6028500	6033860	That actually has its orders coming from a chinese front foundation
6034500	6036500	where a foreign power
6036580	6038180	is
6038180	6040180	organizing these takeovers
6041300	6043940	And doing it in support of an ideology
6044740	6047060	Whose maxim is death to america
6047620	6049780	And these people are burning american flags
6050420	6053060	Right and calling for the destruction of their own country
6053540	6055540	That is an insurrection
6055620	6057940	And these people as far as i am concerned
6058980	6060980	Need to be rounded up
6061460	6067300	And summarily tried not in civil courts because they have stripped themselves of their american citizenship
6067860	6072580	They need to be tried in military tribunals under conditions of martial law
6073380	6078260	That's what has to happen in this country under trump and if it doesn't we're fucked. It's over
6078660	6083380	It's over for this country and it's frankly going to be over for the west as we know it
6084580	6087780	So look civil war is a terrible thing
6088420	6093300	But unfortunately it's going to happen at this point and we need to make sure that we win it
6094020	6096020	Well
6097220	6099700	That's going to bring us to super chats right there
6099700	6104420	I think that you said everything that there is to say about our current situation
6104900	6106900	And what we're going to be
6107460	6113460	Expecting one quick note by the way is that the open society foundation and your source and all that
6114260	6117380	They despite you know, sores being jewish and whatever
6117940	6122180	Have no love towards israel or the west in general
6122740	6126020	And that is something that I think a lot of people who are watching this
6126500	6130500	Tend to forget they tend to lump jewish people into this
6130980	6134980	Whole pile where a lot of the horrible things that you're talking about right now
6135460	6137780	They see them as being the cause of
6138420	6143060	Let me add something there. Let me add something there. George Soros has
6144980	6148420	Ties in his youth to the romanian iron guard
6148980	6154420	George Soros has early affiliations to fascist right-wing groups in europe
6156020	6161140	Otto Scorzani in the 1970s early late 60s early 70s
6161780	6164740	Was doing some things with mosad in israel as well
6165380	6168580	Okay, there are complex business
6169700	6171700	And and military industrial
6172260	6174260	Connections here all across the world
6174900	6178260	The point to the fact that certain quote-unquote jews
6179620	6181620	Look, I know you're of the ukrainian
6182420	6186580	background and that you're sympathetic to the struggle of ukrainian people
6186900	6190740	But frankly the same thing can be said of zolinsky in terms of
6192260	6194260	fascist
6194500	6197380	Ultimately anti-semitic right-wing groups
6197940	6199940	using certain jews
6200580	6205300	In order to accomplish their aims and forward their agenda
6205620	6212580	And here I would direct people to the research of joseph farrell, which I've quoted and cited at length in some of my books
6213140	6215380	Now joseph is a dr. Farrell
6216180	6217220	is a
6217220	6220660	Russian orthodox adherent, okay, so from
6221220	6225380	And I you know, I visited ham at his home and we had very nice conversations on so forth
6225700	6231780	But you know dr. Farrell essentially would consider me a satanist. Okay, so we are we are not aligned
6232660	6234180	spiritually
6234180	6236420	And ethically in many ways however
6237060	6239060	his research on
6239540	6241540	What he calls di spena
6241940	6244580	Is impeccable di spena or the spider
6246020	6250340	Nickname for odessa the the order of former ss officers
6250740	6254020	Which was basically constituted in 1945
6254580	6261060	And was part of what what we have been what we have been introduced to as operation paperclip
6261940	6266580	There was a lot more going on in terms of the importation of nazis
6267380	6269380	post 1945
6269700	6271700	They developed a
6271860	6273220	global
6273220	6275220	financial control system
6275220	6281060	And a military industrial network that ultimately has succeeded in capturing the american deep state
6282020	6285220	And it is these people not the jews
6285940	6287940	Who are ultimately controlling?
6289460	6292900	The kind of policy making that's been detrimental to the west
6293380	6299380	Including in germany where merkel led in all these migrants if you look at the tentacles
6301940	6305620	Around the let's just let me just say it this way around the 9 11 operation
6306180	6308500	They go back to institutions like deutschbank
6309220	6312980	The bank of germany, okay, and you had you know
6314900	6320580	Martin borman hitler's financial mastermind who supposedly died three different times in three different ways
6321060	6326900	Still writing checks through chase Manhattan bank in argentina in the 1970s
6328020	6333220	Go look at joseph arles research the nazi international the european union and the third way
6334580	6337540	The people who have undermined the west
6338340	6339780	through
6339780	6341780	mass migration
6342340	6346740	Social justice agendas and so on so so forth are not jews
6347780	6349780	They're nazis
6349860	6351860	And their ultimate aim
6351940	6358980	Is to foment a backlash. They want a right-wing reaction that they intend
6360100	6364900	To ensure is traditionalist in character. This is a sophisticated
6365140	6371620	Dialectical operation that's taking place. It's what they were always masters at welton shang's creek
6372180	6374020	worldview warfare
6374020	6375540	Okay, so
6375540	6380980	So that's what I have to say about george soros and his ilk is that their pawns their pawns
6381860	6382820	of
6382820	6386900	An ss elite that not only survived the end of the war
6387220	6393540	It went on to ultimately create a hidden power structure in this world and its aim is a traditionalist
6394100	6398500	neo feudal hierarchical system that's going to crush the human individual
6400100	6404900	And israel is a bold work against that israel and its 300 nuclear warheads
6406020	6410180	The only thing I could say is that uh to all the jews who are still
6410740	6417940	Working in you know the new york crimes or any of these you know new republic all these magazines
6418820	6425380	I really recommend them to stop being such idiots because I really do think that unfortunately because jews as you know
6425460	6426900	They live in the city
6426900	6430580	And you can get all kinds of jobs the jobs you end up getting
6431220	6438660	The ones that people end up paying the most attention to just because of how information is disseminated would be jobs in the media
6439220	6445060	So unfortunately you have this weird situation where the people and I wonder I do wonder if what's going on right now
6445140	6448100	These protests are kind of waking some of these people up to their delusions
6448820	6454420	That those were the people who ended up rising through the ranks who were disseminating all of this uh, you know
6455140	6456740	anti-western
6456740	6458020	bullshit
6458020	6460020	That uh the unfortunate
6460260	6466340	Effect of that is that people look up their names and they do all these 4chan infographics saying that you know
6466740	6471700	Jonah goldberg or whoever you know once white people to go extinct and so on and so forth
6472100	6475380	So I don't know like as my final question before the super chats
6475780	6480500	Do you see any way of remedying that because it seems like until that's remedied
6480820	6486020	We're going to have all these people coming out of the woodwork saying like no, they're secretly against us
6486100	6490420	They want to overthrow the west. No, I do. I do see a way to remedy it. I do
6491380	6497540	And that's that I think that the prime minister net and yahoo and and people like defense minister galant and
6497780	6502180	The people who are you know looking into like how october 7th could possibly have been
6502580	6505860	Have have happened within mosad and israeli military intelligence
6506420	6508420	These because you see there were also
6508980	6510980	But israel has been betrayed
6512020	6514820	Israel's been betrayed by the kinds of jews in new york that you're talking about
6515380	6519460	Jews in la and but israel's also been betrayed by certain jews within israel
6520180	6524820	And right now israel has to win this war. That's this primary objective. It has to be achieved
6525460	6527460	Without hesitation israel has to win this war
6527940	6531380	But don't think there's not going to be a reckoning within israel after this war
6531700	6537380	There's a lot of soul searching that's going to take place and there's a massive purge that's coming within israel
6537460	6539460	that's what I think I think that
6540180	6543780	The right kind of leadership learned a really harsh lesson
6544260	6546740	And they know that they have a lot of traders in their midst
6547380	6553140	And they're going to clean these people out because these people represent an existential threat to zionism
6553380	6559220	They they represent an existential threat to the continued existence of a state of israel
6559540	6563860	All right, and I think they're going to need to be weeded out and what I also think is that
6564980	6566980	The right kind of zionists
6567220	6572660	Right people who are just looking to defend a state for people of jewish descent
6573700	6580260	The right kind of zionists are going to find a tremendous ally in the next regime of iran
6580500	6585140	A regime that represents the will of the majority of iranian people who love israel
6585860	6587860	They love america and they love israel
6588420	6590260	and
6590260	6591460	I think that
6591460	6598500	The kind of intelligence and security relationship that could exist again because it existed once between sabaq wasad
6598900	6603620	Very close relationship to the point where they were developing nuclear weapons together. That's a whole other story
6604100	6605140	but
6605140	6608980	There will be an intelligence and security relationship between the future iranian
6610900	6612020	services
6612020	6617540	Whether they want to I I'm partial to the idea of calling it sabaq again. I actually think that's a great idea
6617620	6619220	What does sabaq mean?
6619220	6621220	Oh, it just means
6621220	6625220	So I was one am yet of the et alata ke shfar. It means a state
6626260	6628260	security and intelligence service
6628420	6634020	But you know, it has a horrific aura to it because you know supposedly they tortured people and
6634580	6639460	You know engaged in all kinds of repression. Well, who were they who were they interrogating?
6639700	6641540	They were interrogating
6641540	6644100	A bunch of islamist cockroaches
6644580	6648740	Who have turned women into second-class who are beating women right now?
6649220	6653220	For exposing their hair, right? Islamists who have completely
6654580	6659620	Abrogated freedom of of the press and freedom of speech for the last 45 years in iran
6660740	6666180	Those are the people who they were severely interrogating. They were severely interrogating communists
6666740	6671460	Who wound who apparently were so faithful to their marxist principles their
6672340	6673540	atheistic humanistic
6673540	6679540	Universalist marxist principles that all these fucking iranian communists lined up to support a lunatic like ayatollah chomeini
6680180	6685940	And to bring a bunch of islamic fundamentalists to power those were the communists being interrogated by sabaq
6686820	6692660	All right sabaq was actually doing its job trying to actually the shah was the one who was too much of a bleak part liberal
6693140	6695140	Anyway, anyway be that as it may
6695540	6705140	My point is that the future iranian state security and intelligence apparatus will have an excellent relationship with mosad and shin bet and and you know the israeli
6706500	6707780	services
6707780	6715780	So that the iranians i think will be able to help weed out the wrong kind of israelis and the wrong kind of jews even in the united states
6717620	6720660	Who are undermining the security of israel
6721140	6725700	You know again to reiterate what i said earlier, you know addressing the american people
6726900	6728340	understand
6728340	6734820	That the domestic political situation in america is a vital national security concern of the future iran
6735220	6740580	The future iran is going to find itself immediately in conflict with china in conflict with russia
6740980	6744820	Without a europe that it can count on because europe is being taken over by islamists
6745540	6751940	Right so who is going to be iran's ally well america israel principally and also america
6752260	6757220	So the future iranian state security apparatus cannot very well allow america
6758020	6760020	To be a stage for protests
6761300	6765460	Then mirror the ideology and discourse of the islamic republic
6766340	6767300	understand
6767300	6774100	So the domestic political situation in america is going to be a vital national security interest of the future regime of iran
6774100	6775700	Let me leave it at that
6775700	6778980	Okay, and and that includes whatever misguided jews
6779060	6784580	There are who are you know aligning themselves with these apologists for hamas
6784740	6790820	Yeah, they uh drank the kool-aid just like all these really beautiful girls that i used to have a crush on and now
6790900	6792660	You see their instagram uh
6792660	6796340	Story is all like you know pro gaza. Yeah, you know what i mean
6796340	6799620	It's it's it's a it's a damn shame like like the song goes
6800180	6803380	One last thing i would say is that you know, believe me i know
6803380	6807540	Yeah, uh one last thing i would say regarding israel's that i would highly recommend
6807620	6813380	I'm sure they're doing it already for masa to take a look at people like romana brahmovich and look at all the
6813860	6815620	immigrants from russia
6815620	6820260	To israel as far as their effect because netanyahu himself has had too
6820820	6827620	Chummy of a relationship with uh putin and i think that's one of the things that misguided him keep in mind how often
6827860	6833060	russia's government including putin himself met with representatives of hamas and iran
6834100	6836100	Look, um, i i uh
6837540	6840900	I am certainly not in favor of the conflict in ukraine
6842100	6848980	spiraling into a potential nuclear confrontation between nato and russia that having been said
6849620	6852020	As you remember from our previous conversation
6852660	6857620	Where vlad was also with us vlad davinson. Yeah, yes, and we were discussing october 7th
6858340	6860900	I i told you that i think that
6861860	6865620	All these russian jews in the israeli state security apparatus
6866340	6873540	Who have ties to the kremlin and we know there are a lot of people in mosad who do they are double agents and they work for russian intelligence as well
6874100	6875460	I think uh
6875460	6879060	Something went very wrong that day and it did involve the russians
6879620	6886420	Um, and it was retribution for frankly netanyahu being dragged kicked and screaming by america to support ukraine
6887140	6891220	Uh, but but be that as it may. Yeah, I you know, there's a case to be made that
6891860	6897220	Uh, israel was betrayed by russian jews who ultimately were answering to the orders of the kremlin
6897940	6899940	And now russia's yeah, I can also tell you
6900500	6904340	I'm sorry to say this to the folks who are my final i have a lot of followers who support russia
6904580	6908820	But I can tell you that the future regime of iran is going to be an enemy russia. There's no question
6909380	6912420	There's and they're right across the kast me and c and by the way
6913060	6918420	By the way for people who don't have a sense of history the russians took a quarter of iran's territory
6919060	6920260	It's they fought
6920260	6925700	Two significant wars with iran and they're responsible for taking a quarter of iran's territory
6925860	6931940	So there's a lot of bad blood there and I can well see that there's going to be a future iranian-israeli alliance
6932660	6934660	Even just against russia
6935780	6942020	Well onto uh onto super chats we go so the first super chat is uh from somebody who
6942500	6948020	Did it last time? Uh, but I unfortunately was not able to get to it. So um, here remind me today
6948500	6954340	As a reminder my question was of jason has seen the mh 370 videos
6954740	6960260	That's the hidden tech held by the shadow government and before uh, you respond jason once again
6960420	6967140	Make sure to like subscribe comment click the bell the bell is very important. Uh, anyway, uh, jason, uh, go ahead
6967220	6974020	I've seen it. I've heard analyses of it. Uh, I
6975380	6977380	Have listened to
6977460	6979460	intelligent people who I really respect
6979540	6982020	Who have uh, in some cases said they
6982820	6987860	They think it's legit and in other cases. Um other people who I respect equally
6988420	6993140	Uh have raised questions about you know, uh, the the legitimacy
6994020	6996020	And fidelity of that video
6996100	7003620	Um, whether or not that particular footage is is accurate, you know, it's it's showing these three UFOs
7004340	7010420	circling around mh 370 and basically creating a vortex which the airplane then disappears into
7010820	7014820	That's what it shows and supposedly it was leaked by a high level official
7015380	7023940	Um, and the footage was taken by classified satellites who were looking down at the area that the plane was transiting at the time
7024900	7029700	Whether or not that particular footage is legit. I think that technology exists
7031940	7033540	Hmm
7033540	7035540	Jane Dominic ten dollars
7036100	7041140	Questions for Jojani. Do you see any room for bacchic mania muse inspiration?
7041460	7049460	Jungian individuation or some form of serious promethean divinization in the future of philosophical inquiry
7051620	7053620	The hell do you think i'm doing
7054900	7060420	I mean, that's the core of my whole philosophical project. Yeah, that's pretty softball
7061060	7063060	Of course, I do. Yeah
7063060	7067620	Uh, all right moving on here. Uh, yeah, the ones that we could just answer fast. We could just answer fast
7068180	7070180	Austin ten bucks
7070260	7076020	Ethmogens have been administered in traditional cultures to aid in the development of these psychic abilities
7076180	7079380	Especially for individuals who struggle with the training
7079940	7082180	Uh, well comment any thoughts on it
7083140	7090420	It should be some combination thereof, you know, I mean the right drugs properly used as the Greeks called them pharma kea
7090820	7092420	you know, the right
7092420	7094420	Pharmacons properly administered
7095060	7101060	Um, together with various psychical training regiments are probably the way to go
7102580	7108180	Hmm, but that's drugs as a tool and the craft rather than as an escape
7108660	7110660	hmm
7110660	7114660	No, that's true because when it comes psychedelics, you don't want it to become a crutch
7115460	7116660	right
7116660	7119380	Or an escape form of escapism. Mm-hmm
7120420	7123780	Uh, cerulean valley. I don't know if this was a mistake
7124660	7128260	100 dollars. Thank you so much cerulean valley
7128820	7133860	Uh, okay. Here we go. They in quotes are more advanced in every field
7134180	7141620	Um, uh, you speak of ludite ism will be psychologically healthy for most inhabitants on this planet
7142020	7145540	You can't even astral project. It's not your choice
7145940	7149780	But just accept their traditionalist dominion over you
7150420	7152420	You will lose
7153300	7157300	First of all, I have astral projected second of all, uh
7158260	7165620	That's perfectly fine if traditionalism is going to be suitable for the majority of the planet in that case
7165700	7173220	I'm interested in eliminating the majority that are going to subjugate the minority of people who absolutely do not deserve to have their
7173300	7179380	Individuality subsumed by traditionalism. Okay. I am a radically anti-majoritarian person
7179700	7186420	I'm the furthest thing from a populist you can ever imagine. I am for the individual. I'm a radical individualist
7186820	7191700	Who's totally devoted to the defense of liberty and progress
7192340	7193460	so
7193460	7199620	Think again, okay, and I can also tell you that as I've had to incessantly repeat every time someone
7200260	7203700	Asks as if this is a question asks a question like this
7206020	7208020	That number one
7208420	7212900	Going back to what you asked me love about buddha, right many of our conversation number one
7213780	7216980	There's another class of beings opposed to the olympians
7217700	7220980	Or the devas namely the ashuras or the titans
7221380	7225060	They're in the mix here and they're very angry people. If you think i'm angry
7225300	7231220	You see what these people are like. This is why the buddhas depicted them as demons. I mean, they're very angry people very violent people
7231780	7235780	They've had nuclear wars in the past. You look at the mahabarata and the ramayana
7236580	7239620	and you look at uh, libyan desert glass
7240260	7243780	And you know various vitrified stones in south america
7244260	7249780	You can see the evidence for the nuclear wars between the ashuras and the devas in the distant past
7250180	7253700	so to begin with the ashuras are in the mix and
7255540	7260260	Look their policy is that they don't want to have to come in and solve the problem for us
7260500	7263700	They want to see some kind of human initiative and frankly
7264900	7268020	It's much better for us if we tried to determine
7268980	7273380	Our own future course and set the conditions for
7274420	7279380	You know securing our liberty by ourselves to the greatest extent possible
7279700	7285380	We don't want to be beholden to some group of titans or ashuras either. Remember prometheus is this rather
7286020	7289620	ambiguous trickster figure who initially betrays the titans
7290020	7294100	Decide with the gods and then turns on the gods to defend humanity, right?
7294420	7299460	So looking at it from a promethean perspective, I don't want us to be beholden to the ashuras
7300020	7302020	The the titans either
7302020	7305380	But they're in the mix and they're very powerful. They're very powerful
7305620	7312100	They're the reason why there's not a biosphere on mars anymore. Okay, so whoever quote, you know made this
7312740	7313860	Uh
7313860	7320340	statement is forgetting that and what's more important than that is that quite apart from the ashuras
7320740	7326100	You have this entity that I spent some time discussing which, you know, I come around to
7326980	7333940	Uh engaging with at the end of philosophy of the future this trickster this cosmic trickster and its various
7334740	7341300	avatars and emissaries and that force is so much more powerful than the debuts
7342180	7346740	And that's why when I talk about phenomenal authorization, I make the point that look
7346980	7348980	This trickster
7349940	7352980	Sees the movements of the devas
7354180	7358100	Not necessarily like movements of chess pieces across a chess board
7358500	7363700	Because the game is more like backgammon. It involves an element of chance a roll of the die
7364180	7368020	But it's kind of like a backgammon game except that the trickster
7370180	7375700	Can win but the trickster is interested in the game and the possibilities opened up by the game
7376340	7382500	Okay, so frankly the person who posed this who made this statement is utterly clueless
7383060	7389220	Hmm. Well, he thinks you're a heretic. That's the other thing. Well, I am a yeah. Well, he's right about that
7390820	7396980	Who I'm a Muslim. Yeah, and you can be born into any religion. I was born muslim
7397140	7401300	So I'm not just a heretic. I'm an apostate. He gets pretty rude over here
7401300	7405700	But if you'd like I can read you his five dollar chat right after the one hundred dollar one
7407700	7409700	Let's spend more time on somebody's
7410420	7412420	You know, who's
7412980	7417700	Yeah, yeah, the the cherry on top give other people. Yeah trial size dove
7418340	7423620	$10 seems to me the birth of humanity is a radically anomalous and finite event
7423940	7429140	With this entity working to coax as much growth potential from us before that energy dissipates
7430100	7434180	Say that again one more time sure lower. Okay. Here we go
7434900	7435940	Um
7435940	7441460	Seems to me the birth of humanity is radically anomalous and finite event
7441860	7448260	With this entity working to coax as much growth potential from us before that energy dissipates
7448500	7462500	It's a question of scale it goes back to when you were talking about we can imagine that there's a macrocosm that's you know
7463620	7465060	Has you know
7465060	7467620	Vast in such and such a way and there's all kinds of
7468340	7473460	intelligences that are potentially so far beyond ours and well, you know, you could imagine a context
7474980	7476980	That would render humanity
7478500	7480500	this relatively unexpected
7481620	7482820	and
7482820	7484820	anomalous
7487060	7491940	Phenomenon which this trickster is taking great pains to
7493300	7499620	Cultivate right and to nurture albeit, you know as a very severe mother
7501620	7506900	That's you could imagine that but again you're imagining a context for which there's no empirical evidence
7507460	7510820	And when you look at the literature of close encounters, that's not
7511300	7514980	Of the picture that we get you know, I don't want to repeat myself like I said earlier
7515540	7518580	the close encounter phenomenon suggests that actually
7520100	7521620	humanity
7521620	7524340	or the evolution of humanity
7524980	7526980	into a potentially
7526980	7528900	superhuman species
7528900	7533780	Is at the center of the cosmos that it's the central phenomenon of existence
7534020	7536020	Chester ten dollars
7537540	7544020	Ca, ca, that is uh, that is chester right there. Uh, great friend of the show
7544660	7548740	Um, next we have ashton milky way 50 dollars
7549380	7556340	Sorry jason, but how can you look at the Rothschild history of banking and the history of banking in general?
7556660	7563060	And say that the jews are not the ones controlling the system. I think you're foolish for believing in their propaganda
7564260	7566420	Read joseph arles books. He also has
7567220	7569220	Uh texts that are specifically
7570180	7572180	Dedicated to the history of banking
7572900	7574900	Like the financial vipers of venice
7575700	7577700	um, and
7577860	7582820	When you read his work on the development of the international banking system
7583620	7588260	In the context of his tracing the genealogy of what you might call the fourth Reich
7588820	7590980	This occulted Reich, which i've written about
7591300	7593300	You can see
7593860	7602820	To what extent various banking families including ones of jewish descent were assimilated and ensconced by this essentially
7603540	7605380	uh
7605380	7607860	I don't even want to call it fascist. I don't know
7609140	7613140	Nazi post-nazi system, right? Um
7613860	7618340	Joseph's work is is what you should look at if you're interested in actually understanding what's going on here
7619300	7626980	And so i'll just leave it at that. Hmm. That would be the same author to look at as far as um hitler being funded
7627300	7631940	Because it's weird like i was watching this uh gentleman on youtube named tick history
7632180	7635060	and he tries to make well first of all he makes the case that uh, uh,
7635700	7639300	Nazi germany was very socialist in how it operated
7639300	7645460	But the second thing is that he tries to say well hitler was not funded by any of these rich people
7645460	7650580	It was a very grass roots movement, you know, they raised their money from the people
7651780	7653780	shit
7654980	7658420	I mean look the thula gazelle shaft consisted of a bunch of barons and aristocrats
7658580	7664340	And it's the thula gazelle shaft that set up the nsdap as a as a pack as a political action committee
7664500	7669060	To help fight communism on the streets of germany. So we you know, we know that the
7669780	7676100	Planning the master mining of the rise of hitler came from very rich people with international banking connections
7676820	7682340	Though hitler himself was not a big fan of the uh aristocracy at least from what i understand
7682900	7686980	There was this a lady who i think you met as well at that event that we were at
7687380	7690580	Who talked about how um her father was this german aristocrat?
7690740	7697140	He was a general and hitler used to pin medals on him in such a way as to puncture his, uh, skin
7697540	7701700	And she interpreted that as being his hatred for this upper echelon
7703300	7707620	He was a rabble rouser who had a very specific purpose and
7708340	7710100	mission to fulfill
7710100	7712260	They used him
7712260	7720260	Okay, and that became abundantly clear to the sad broken man when he was put out to pasture in bariloche argentina
7720660	7722660	in 1946
7722660	7729540	Until listen hair hitler just paint your sunsets leave it to us. We've got it all under control
7730100	7736660	Okay, i think he lived a very sad last 20 years of his life down there in, uh, argentina
7737460	7743140	And it became abundantly clear to him that he had been played and used by people
7743620	7749380	Whose machinations he could not even begin to wrap his mind around and those people are still in control of our world today
7750340	7751700	Damn
7751700	7754500	Well, uh, we're here. We have fin brown ten dollars
7755220	7760180	So we have two remaining here unless anybody sends anything else. These would be the last two so fin brown
7760900	7765620	$10 thoughts on the concept of a live live player
7766580	7768580	non npc types
7770180	7775300	Thoughts on npc's no no no the live player so the opposite of what an npc is
7775860	7781540	What about what thoughts i mean out of the concept like what exactly entails a live player well in your book
7781540	7783220	you were writing about
7783220	7785060	consciousness and
7785060	7790020	Whether you see there being like this great asian of consciousness where people who would be more like the npc's
7790420	7795700	Would have less of it and people would who would be more of the players to have more of it or is it much more distinct?
7796820	7798820	individuality
7798980	7800980	Personal conscience
7801300	7803300	You know self reflection
7803780	7805780	critical thinking
7805780	7807780	Above all creative vision
7808180	7812260	Right all the things that these protesters we see in the streets today lack
7813300	7816820	And by the way, I just want to make one point that I neglected to make earlier
7817060	7821300	Is that because a lot of you know underserting people will say oh, but what about you know
7821380	7828100	The communists who took over columbia university in 1968 and so forth, you know on behalf of the students for a democratic society sds
7828180	7830420	Or let's say the activities of the weather underground
7831380	7835780	Completely different completely different. Look
7836500	7841780	Uh, you don't have to be a communist or agree with communism to understand why
7842580	7850820	Dropping napalm on vietnamese children was not a just war. Okay, the vietnam war was an unjust war
7851300	7853300	Okay, at least at least
7853780	7858340	One can understand a person who takes that position and protests the war
7858740	7865620	And also if you look at the doctrine of classic communism going back, you know to marx supposedly
7866420	7868420	However misguided you may think it is
7869300	7870820	It's ultimately
7870820	7872820	an aspiration for
7872900	7876180	liberation and enlightenment and an egalitarian
7876980	7882980	world society where you know women have more equal after all look the soviet union sent women into space
7884020	7886020	Way before we did okay
7886340	7893780	So there are things that you can respect about classic communism and about the communists who took over columbia university in 1968
7895300	7900900	The cockroaches and vermin and parasites today who have desecrated those places
7902020	7906900	Have also hollowed out anything that was respectable about communist ideology
7907460	7913220	They have in fact imploded communist ideology by aligning themselves to the most traditionalist and retarded
7914180	7918500	You know religious tradition on the planet namely islam
7919540	7921540	And by the way, this is a rerun for me
7921540	7927860	It's a horrific rerun because all of us who have some iranian heritage saw this happen in iran in 1978 1979
7928020	7933140	We're all the fucking leftists suddenly somehow forgot marx and got behind ayatollah homani and the molas
7933460	7939220	That's why we have an islamic republic today. It's the leftists in iran who brought the islamic republic to power
7939460	7945300	They were the firepower behind it. They were the guerrilla fighters who toppled the shah's regime not these turbans molas
7945700	7951460	It's the leftists who did it. So look, I don't know what that says. I don't I won't blame marx for it though
7952580	7956740	If you look back in my work, you see I actually you respect marx a great deal
7956980	7960580	The thing is that his followers have now come to the point where
7961300	7966740	Evidently, you know, they've become the the epitome of these zombie NPCs
7967540	7971220	And so I don't see, uh, you know a legitimate future for leftists
7971700	7977460	And the ussr was also supporting palestine back in the day era fat was an agent of the soviets
7978420	7984900	No, okay, but that's not there because the ussr was also the first and greatest supporter of the state of israel
7984980	7986980	That's true. Well, that's before israel
7987540	7989540	You could say kind of betrayed it
7989540	7995700	Yes, so is the soviets felt betrayed by israel because actually the soviets were the first supporters of israel
7996100	7997220	before
7997220	8004180	France and france became the second strongest supporter of israel and then united states only really started supporting israel after canadi
8004980	8008740	No, that's true. Yeah, you have a point there. So, uh, over here, although
8008980	8009860	I
8009860	8015380	Do remember reading that the soviets were also the ones who coined the term palestinian, but that's like going in a whole
8016260	8021540	Rabbit hole as far as where these terms originate from, you know, well the woman's going to turn palestinian
8021540	8028340	No, I mean like palestinian in the context of what happened after israel, you know, as far as like the palestinian people versus the
8028900	8034820	Yeah, well, no, I wouldn't I wouldn't be shocked that that came out of some soviet propaganda office. So here we have a
8035860	8037940	Valhulm 10 dollars
8037940	8042980	How does the world that results out of the niches split of humanity into ubermench and entermench?
8043460	8044740	Is any
8044740	8050420	Functionally different than what the davis have constructed with their breakaway civilization
8052260	8061540	Because what the davis are envisioning is a hierarchical caste society where there are different rungs of human beings in that society
8061940	8070340	Okay, until you get to the highest rung which is a a priestly class the brahmin whose sole purpose is to serve the davis
8070580	8076660	It's a caste hierarchy. What niches talking about is essentially the destruction of humanity
8077780	8078660	through
8078660	8085220	The under mention becoming a machinery of production. These aren't human beings anymore. We're not talking about human beings anymore
8086100	8088100	It's it's a completely
8088100	8093620	It and by the way, niches doesn't describe this a great length because it's right at the margin
8094020	8097140	Of what he can really what he's really capable of contemplating
8097860	8102820	In terms of how technological advancement is going to alter the human condition
8103060	8106100	There are a few notes on this in the will to power mainly
8106660	8114420	Where you see him describe how the machinery of production as he puts it is going to ensconce and transform
8114740	8117300	the under mention into a
8118100	8119860	base upon which
8119860	8122100	The ubermen pursue their own destinies
8122740	8125220	But the ubermen are not slave masters
8125540	8131220	The under mention are not slaves of the ubermen nicha really belabors this point niches
8131460	8134980	Entire ethical doctrine is a critique of slave morality
8135620	8138100	Right and an advocacy for a kind of
8138660	8144580	Morality where the individual sets his own goals and purposes and is not dependent upon
8145380	8149220	Basically, you know oppressing and manipulating anybody else. Yeah
8150020	8152740	Okay, so so it's a radically different vision
8153540	8155540	Actually, it's a much
8156500	8161700	And I've said this before it's a much harsher vision because to the extent that most people don't want to be free
8161940	8164500	And most people want to be cattle and most people are sheep
8164900	8170340	Well, then the dave of vision is much more compassionate because it accommodates that majority inside this pyramid
8170660	8174260	Nietzsche's vision is saying listen either evolve or you're going to be a machine
8176420	8179780	Next super chat over here we have uh from uh kalab
8180820	8185300	Your uh ten dollars your thoughts about the global loss of res publica
8185860	8190260	And its replacement in the internet where the public ceases to
8191060	8197300	Check and balance richard senates the fall of public man comes to mind
8202100	8206500	Look, I think that the republic first of all the republic was a noble idea
8207620	8210500	Especially if we take care to discern
8211700	8213700	um, you know
8214020	8219460	To to make a distinction between a republican constitutional structure and a democracy
8220100	8227060	The kind of republican constitutional structure that the founding fathers of the united states articulated in our constitution and our bill of rights
8227860	8230580	was a very noble minded
8231220	8237620	Uh and progressive endeavor in the proper sense of the word progressive which I entirely embrace
8238580	8241380	And intend to safeguard against these retarded leftists
8242900	8248100	But the fact of the matter is that even by the middle of the 20th century with the rise of
8249860	8250980	you know
8250980	8258420	instantaneous global banking and military industrial corporations and mega corporations and you know
8260500	8263620	You know supersonic air travel and so on and so forth
8264580	8267780	And and the and attendant global business class and
8269060	8271060	Such developments
8271060	8276900	Already rendered the republic an antiquated form of political organization. That is the case
8277700	8280660	Uh, it was already the case in the 1950s, frankly
8281700	8287380	And certainly as we approach the technological singularity, we're going to have to consider
8288100	8294340	A new form of political organization that safeguards the liberty and creative potential of the individual
8295140	8297380	um, and that replaces republics
8298100	8303140	And that replaces nation states as we've conceived of them thus thus far, right?
8304020	8306020	Now I don't want that to be any kind of world government
8306500	8307540	but
8307540	8309540	We need to come up with a a
8309860	8313300	A replacement for the republic that at the same time
8313940	8321140	In spirit safeguards what it is that let's say the bill of rights of our republic was intended to protect
8321940	8323940	So I don't see the
8324100	8328500	The obsolescence of the republic of the res publica as a necessarily
8329460	8331060	negative
8331140	8333140	Development I see it as an evolutionary
8333860	8335780	eventuality
8335780	8337620	And as far as the internet is concerned
8337620	8343940	I think the problem with the internet is that the worldwide web is increasingly controlled by mega corporations
8344740	8346100	and that
8346100	8349540	What we need to do is develop blockchain networks
8350100	8355620	That use the fundamental substrate technology of the internet in ways that
8356180	8360500	Are impervious to corporate and other centralized control
8361940	8365620	Absolutely. So here we have ashton milky way 20 dollars
8365700	8371780	How can we possibly prepare for the technological singularity and the coming catastrophe in the next 20 years?
8374580	8376580	Who is we?
8376900	8379540	One of the point and you've heard me say this yes, yes
8380260	8383300	one of the points that I I always make is that
8384900	8388500	Considering that we have maybe 15 maybe 20 years
8389060	8393620	Between us and the technological singularity at this point. I keep revising my estimate downward
8395700	8397700	There's no way that the world can prepare
8398100	8399540	There's no way
8399540	8403460	Simply impossible the vast majority of people
8404500	8409140	Who are either adherents of islam by 20 again? I repeat the statistic
8409620	8416500	Given current demographic trend and by the way people should remember this every time they call what's going on in gaza a genocide
8417460	8419460	The palestinians are arabs
8420420	8422420	majority of them arab muslims
8423140	8428900	There are 22 arab countries in the world all of which by the way refuse to take in these palestinians
8429460	8430900	okay
8430900	8435300	And beyond the arab world. There are gigantic countries like malaysia
8435860	8437860	indonesia pakistan
8438580	8444500	That are host to huge muslim populations. India has more muslims in it than pakistan
8444660	8449860	Okay, so we are dealing with a population bomb here
8451060	8453780	Which is going to result in it and by the way when you think about you know
8453780	8456900	These people's proposals to turn the united nations into a global democracy
8457060	8461700	Well, what the fuck would a global democracy be in 2075 when the majority of people on the earth are muslim?
8462340	8466500	So every time these morons talk about what's going on in gaza as a genocide
8466740	8468740	they ought to remember that a
8469460	8474260	muslim majority on this planet by 2075 means the genocide of
8474740	8479940	Every other culture on earth because we know and especially we who have an iranian heritage know
8480500	8486420	That what islam does is genocide other cultures the specialty of islam is the genocide of other cultures
8486740	8492980	And we we see it just recently in iraq with isis what they did to the Kurds
8493780	8497700	By the way, recently there was a story that made me absolutely incensed
8498260	8502180	as if you know as if there isn't enough to be incensed about story of a
8502900	8504900	Kurdish woman
8504980	8508100	Who was raped and held captive by isis in northern iraq
8509220	8514820	And she wrote this book and she was supposed to give a presentation about it. I believe it was in canada
8516100	8518100	And her book event
8518340	8521300	Was cancelled because they were afraid
8522020	8524020	It would promote islamophobia
8525060	8529140	So this poor woman who was tortured and raped by isis
8529620	8536180	Doesn't get to tell her story about what muslims are like because it might promote fear of islam
8536900	8542740	Just we we are living already in an orwellian 1984 world. It is as bad as that
8542900	8549700	Oh, all I could say is as that all I could say is that the people who are afraid of confronting these kind of things
8550260	8552260	Get what they deserve
8552820	8558740	Because if you are not afraid and you are willing to accept the consequences and fight for what you believe in
8559140	8561140	Yes, there's going to be pushback
8561460	8566740	But at least you could actually sleep at night knowing that you're not going to uh, you know
8566820	8572260	Be one of these uh yellow bellied cowards who just allow all of this uh to go on
8572820	8578580	Yeah, but to answer your question, sure, they're gonna get what's coming. So but to answer your question, the problem is this
8580580	8582580	In the face of the technological singularity
8583620	8585460	15 to 20 years from now
8585540	8591060	How do you expect that the world or people at large people writ large when you say that
8592100	8594100	Are going to prepare for the singularity
8595060	8595940	when
8595940	8599940	increasingly, uh, you know, we have a muslim majority on the planet
8600660	8604660	And uh, the rest of the people are either confusion chinese
8605220	8611140	Who are ultimately as regressive and uh inimical to change and progress
8611780	8617300	And we have uh, putin with 3000 nuclear warheads embracing russian orthodoxy
8617620	8619620	And then we see what's going on in the west
8620100	8622420	Where there's mass conversion to islam in europe
8623060	8626500	And there's american university students going around
8627060	8628100	uh
8628100	8635060	chanting death to america slogans from a fundamentalist islamic regime and and uh converting to islam
8635700	8637700	under the palestinian flag
8637700	8639700	so
8639780	8643620	What what world what world prepare for the technological singularity? No, no, no, no, no
8644820	8646820	A small minority
8647220	8649220	of people with promethean
8649380	8651380	foresight and forethought
8651940	8654180	Who care about preserving their own liberty
8654980	8657620	And maximizing their own creative potential
8658260	8660660	Are gonna band together as a group of rebels
8661220	8663780	Like the rebels who set the american revolution in motion
8664340	8668820	And we are gonna defend our future our future at any cost
8670420	8672420	Liberty or death
8673700	8679780	Austin ten dollars is there any chance that iran rid itself of the horrific theocracy now in place?
8680900	8687620	And restore its traditional empire and dignity as a great culture and civilization between east and west
8688180	8692740	And that's going to be like the final super chat before that cherry on top that we uh talked about but yeah
8693460	8695460	Of course it will happen
8695460	8698660	Of someone who's worked for that for many years of my life
8699780	8702420	I can tell you it will most certainly happen
8703300	8704580	but
8704580	8707460	There is in that process an absolutely
8708500	8712900	integral and indispensable role to be played by the state of israel
8713540	8718180	And everyone who wants to see that iran come into being has to understand
8719460	8721460	That it is inextricable
8722420	8724980	From support for zionism
8725620	8727620	Um
8727940	8730740	Lastly uh speaking of that before the cherry on top
8731300	8737300	Could you please tell because I know that you said it before I want to make sure that I got this because that's the one thing that I missed
8737700	8739700	When I was talking about um
8740020	8742020	Uh humab adin and the muslim brotherhood
8742340	8747060	What was the connection between what was going on in the obama administration back then
8747620	8750980	And obviously I think the biden administration is kind of a continuation of that
8751460	8759060	And what we're seeing right now with these protests and getting rid of the um all references to islam within the counter terrorism manuals
8760900	8762500	Well, I think I addressed it already
8762500	8768260	I told you that from my years of working in the iranian opposition where we engaged in significant lobbying activities
8768660	8772340	At one point I was even sitting with a member of the national security council
8772900	8778180	But I can tell you that the democrats very clearly have a pro islamist agenda
8778660	8781540	And they want to keep for example the islamic republican power in iran
8782420	8785620	So so what do they get for it? What's stated in that direction?
8786100	8788100	But what do they
8788100	8791940	What do they obtain by taking that kind of position at the end of the day?
8792020	8794900	What's their carrot at the end of the stake? Is it just money? Is it power?
8796100	8800260	Money and power they they get financed and they get to win elections
8800660	8804260	It's the same reason why they bring, you know millions of migrants into our country
8804420	8809860	They're trying to demographically re-engineer our country so that they can stay in power staying in power means getting more money
8810340	8815460	It's just a racket for these people. I mean they're corrupt. They use political office as a way to amass wealth
8815540	8816420	That's all it is
8816420	8822420	They're a mafia and they don't give a fuck about the future or our children's future, you know, that's all they are a bunch of looters
8823140	8828740	Uh now to uh serrillion valley who's been super chatting all of this time
8829380	8831380	Uh serrillion valley
8832020	8837700	Now you said before that you are up to hearing a super chats here, but they do get a little bit spicy
8838180	8840020	Towards you
8840020	8841540	You know, uh
8841540	8847300	I don't think that's a good note to end on I think that a better note to end on would be yet again for me to
8848340	8853700	Direct people to the american colossus not just website american colossus.org
8854260	8858500	But also to the american colossus substack. We have an american colossus substack

8875140	8882580	All the way to um a new piece that I've written on the close encounter phenomenon. There's an essay called the
8883300	8885300	airships of prometheus

8887940	8890180	Where I actually go back and revise
8891060	8894500	Well, I wouldn't say I revise my thesis. I present an alternative
8895140	8897700	Uh interpretation and hypothesis
8898180	8901140	concerning the airship mystery of 1890
8901780	8907300	Uh 1896 1897, which I know is something that you and I have discussed before and you took the time to try to find
8907700	8914420	The families of some of the dentists isn't calling back. I gotta try again, but I appreciate you remembering that. Yeah
