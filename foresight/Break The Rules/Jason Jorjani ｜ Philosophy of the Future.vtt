00:00.000 --> 00:06.680
We're live. Oh, okay. Good. That's fine. All right, everybody. Welcome to another episode of the Break the Rules live stream

00:06.680 --> 00:09.780
I'm your host, Lev Polyakov, and we are here today

00:10.400 --> 00:12.400
again with Dr.

00:12.520 --> 00:14.520
Jason Reza Giorgiani

00:14.960 --> 00:18.000
PhD it is a great honor as always to have you here my friend

00:18.240 --> 00:26.780
We are going to be talking about your latest book Philosophy of the Future as well as talking about what's currently going on within the

00:26.900 --> 00:30.260
political realm and I'm sure that there is a way that we can

00:30.660 --> 00:34.320
Bring those two things together because I personally think that they are very much

00:34.940 --> 00:38.220
Interrelated and of course if you guys have not read the Dr.

00:38.220 --> 00:42.980
Giorgiani's books yet first of all I highly recommend you go into the description right now and

00:43.220 --> 00:49.460
Get yourself a copy of the latest book as well as look at Prometheus and Atlas lovers of Sophia

00:49.940 --> 00:54.460
So so many different books Iranian Leviathan the list goes up Prometheism

00:54.460 --> 00:56.460
So you are going to be

00:57.340 --> 01:03.940
Extremely pleased if this is your first time ever discovering Dr. Giorgiani and his wonderful work and

01:04.420 --> 01:06.420
With that I first want to ask

01:07.260 --> 01:10.340
Dr. Giorgiani about the Prometheus

01:11.060 --> 01:13.700
Titan project however things go in with that

01:13.940 --> 01:18.100
So please let us know and once again like comment subscribe

01:18.860 --> 01:23.940
Super chat ten dollars minimum today and let's go for it. Dr. Giorgiani. You've got the floor

01:24.700 --> 01:27.460
It's a pleasure to be on your show again Lev as always

01:27.900 --> 01:32.100
So last time I think it was the last time that I was on BTR

01:32.100 --> 01:39.300
I introduced the American Colossus project to build a monument to Prometheus on Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay and

01:40.900 --> 01:44.820
We talked about the sculpture in general terms and we also went into

01:46.100 --> 01:50.900
What I described as an NFT project at that point really it's not an NFT project

01:50.940 --> 01:59.380
It's more like a digital raffle that will use NFT technology and that's going to involve a nationwide treasure hunt with clues embedded in these in these

02:00.180 --> 02:02.700
Raffles and with very compelling

02:03.380 --> 02:05.380
Aesthetic imagery and so on and so forth

02:05.740 --> 02:11.740
So we discussed that a bit last time. I wanted to give viewers some updates regarding the Colossus project

02:12.580 --> 02:14.580
Some rather significant updates

02:14.940 --> 02:20.460
We are really moving we're working hard and moving at breakneck speed here on this project

02:20.460 --> 02:25.180
It's definitely moving forward. We have found a sculptor

02:26.500 --> 02:30.020
Fantastic sculptor who is an uber Nietzschean

02:30.660 --> 02:37.220
Promethean in the spirit of his work and I think I had mentioned last time I was on that the kind of

02:38.340 --> 02:45.020
Fash wave Greco-Roman type sculptures that you see as 3d renderings that are on the website of americancolossus.org

02:45.500 --> 02:52.100
Right now that they're really placeholders and that the sculpture itself will be more sophisticated in terms of its aesthetics

02:52.100 --> 02:54.300
I think I did touch on that well

02:54.300 --> 03:01.180
You can get a much clearer sense of that now because our sculptor will be a gentleman by the name of fen de Villiers

03:01.180 --> 03:04.140
And you can go to his website a fen de Villiers

03:04.740 --> 03:05.940
and

03:05.940 --> 03:07.780
he

03:07.780 --> 03:10.100
has a fascinating idea of

03:10.860 --> 03:17.300
Retracing the history of Western aesthetics within the context of an overarching style of modernism

03:17.380 --> 03:22.580
So in a lot of the works that he has up on his website right now and his current sculpture portfolio

03:22.740 --> 03:26.800
You can see projects that have a kind of archaic aesthetic

03:27.580 --> 03:29.580
reiterated within the context of modernism

03:29.820 --> 03:35.740
But as I understand it fen is interested in moving now more toward exploring classicism

03:36.300 --> 03:38.740
But again within the context of modernism

03:38.780 --> 03:46.540
So probably the sculpture that winds up being erected on Alcatraz will have somewhat of an art deco feel to it a kind of

03:47.260 --> 03:48.780
classical modernist

03:48.780 --> 03:50.780
Archeo-futuristic hybrid

03:50.860 --> 03:52.700
that you know

03:52.700 --> 03:56.940
One saw some examples of during the zenith of the art deco era

03:58.060 --> 03:59.740
And I think that's very

03:59.740 --> 04:02.540
Consonant with the spirit of Prometheus

04:03.420 --> 04:06.220
Because there's a kind of you know renaissance

04:07.340 --> 04:09.260
fusion of

04:09.260 --> 04:15.180
Art qua craft with craft qua technology in that aesthetic in particular

04:15.180 --> 04:17.780
It's also a very American aesthetic if you ask me

04:17.780 --> 04:21.020
I mean some of the greatest American cities New York included of course

04:21.700 --> 04:25.700
were predominantly built in the art deco style and you know

04:25.700 --> 04:30.900
That was the historical moment when America wound up becoming the leading nation on the planet

04:31.460 --> 04:33.060
So

04:33.060 --> 04:35.060
I think that's a very positive development

04:35.380 --> 04:39.300
And if you're going to listen to some of fen's interviews with various podcasters

04:39.860 --> 04:41.620
You can see that

04:41.620 --> 04:43.620
In terms of his worldview

04:43.620 --> 04:48.820
He is the perfect man for the job. He actually has his own manifesto his own aesthetic manifesto

04:49.380 --> 04:52.500
And I think in a lot of ways it dovetails with

04:53.460 --> 04:56.500
With our own vision with the vision of Prometheus. I'm certainly

04:57.460 --> 05:00.100
It's that's one. Yeah, it's a very interesting that

05:01.060 --> 05:02.260
Fen is being a part of this

05:02.260 --> 05:05.620
I remember first reading about him in men's world magazine

05:06.100 --> 05:09.780
And I do see there being a convergence as well as a divergence

05:10.180 --> 05:16.900
Apart as far as what you're doing and what let's say, you know bronze age pervert and people like that have been up to

05:18.580 --> 05:24.260
Yes, well, look, there is a certain atmosphere which we will we will come around to discussing today, right?

05:24.660 --> 05:29.700
A certain atmosphere that's been created by the left, which has gone full retard

05:30.660 --> 05:32.340
and

05:32.340 --> 05:37.940
that's going to necessitate a reaction to a certain extent and you know, what

05:38.980 --> 05:41.140
What is necessary in order to?

05:42.580 --> 05:44.580
Regain our footing and

05:44.900 --> 05:46.900
Prevent a civilizational collapse

05:47.460 --> 05:51.780
Maybe somewhat different from what I would believe to be ideal

05:52.180 --> 05:54.420
But we're never going to get to any kind of an ideal

05:54.820 --> 06:01.780
Promethean society as I might envision it if our civilization is is taken under by these leftists and social justice warriors

06:01.780 --> 06:05.940
so there is a kind of a degree of reaction that's necessary and

06:06.500 --> 06:13.300
You know for many reasons I think you know fend is certainly the right man for the job and and it's a positive thing that you know his

06:14.740 --> 06:16.740
That he has connections with those circles

06:17.060 --> 06:22.420
Because we are going to need to solicit their support and we need as broad a coalition as possible

06:23.140 --> 06:25.140
to stand a chance in

06:25.220 --> 06:28.340
you know, basically not just saving but but

06:29.060 --> 06:30.500
but

06:30.500 --> 06:32.500
resuscitating our civilization and

06:33.140 --> 06:39.940
Kindling a second renaissance of the west. So that's a very positive development for the classes project, but there's another

06:41.140 --> 06:45.140
Development that in some ways I see as equally positive and that's that

06:47.060 --> 06:49.060
We are going to make a tv series

06:49.700 --> 06:52.180
That traces the making of the colossus

06:53.300 --> 06:55.620
And it's going to involve stunning visuals

06:56.260 --> 06:59.940
initially 3d renderings but ultimately a tracing of the

07:00.740 --> 07:04.180
process that leads to the construction of the colossus itself

07:04.900 --> 07:08.580
And we found the perfect director for this tv series

07:08.740 --> 07:10.740
It's a it's a series that

07:11.060 --> 07:13.780
Through this director and the work that she's done

07:14.340 --> 07:19.940
Will likely also have very significant high-level distribution and while I can't reveal, you know

07:21.540 --> 07:25.700
The name of this person as of yet. I can say that

07:26.420 --> 07:29.860
She is absolutely the perfect director for the project

07:30.740 --> 07:33.300
really strong sharp woman who

07:34.580 --> 07:36.580
shares a lot of our vision and

07:36.980 --> 07:41.700
Who frankly is just a really cool person who I look forward to working with over the coming years

07:42.020 --> 07:47.940
And I also think that it's great to you know, finally have a woman in a prominent place in this project

07:48.580 --> 07:50.740
Do you see her in a way as being your uh,

07:51.060 --> 07:53.060
Promethea if you will

07:53.140 --> 07:57.860
Well, I don't know that, you know, she I don't know that she would want to be put in any such a position, but she's certainly

07:58.500 --> 08:02.740
uh a more than competent director with a

08:03.380 --> 08:04.980
deeply shared

08:04.980 --> 08:06.980
vision and orientation

08:06.980 --> 08:08.100
and

08:08.180 --> 08:11.540
A person who I think it's going to be an absolute pleasure to work with over the coming years

08:11.860 --> 08:17.380
And I will be working closely with her because she's going to basically trace the entire process and make a historical record

08:18.500 --> 08:23.700
So, uh, I was uh reading and I finished your amazing latest book philosophy of the future

08:24.180 --> 08:31.220
And what I noticed is that it did require me to have a certain bits of knowledge from all the other books that you've read

08:31.540 --> 08:34.420
In order to in a way try and complete the puzzle

08:34.820 --> 08:37.940
That is your latest one because you throw a lot of references

08:38.020 --> 08:41.860
Not that people need to specifically read all your other books to enjoy this one

08:42.180 --> 08:47.700
But it definitely helps to be well acquainted with what happened in the past as far as certain questions that I

08:48.180 --> 08:50.180
always had in my mind as far as

08:50.660 --> 08:54.100
in Iranian leviathan, whether it was the

08:55.140 --> 09:02.180
um, uh, the persians, uh, the dynasty that created islam or whether it was these nephilim

09:02.740 --> 09:05.780
Like that is a very interesting thing for me to, uh,

09:06.420 --> 09:13.300
Digest as far as what exactly is the truth where you are playing the role of the trickster

09:13.780 --> 09:18.340
And how exactly that's going to lead to the conclusions that you wanted to lead to

09:18.580 --> 09:20.900
I don't know if that's a good place to start

09:21.300 --> 09:24.900
But uh, let me know like where exactly you would be interested in

09:25.860 --> 09:28.500
In a way, frankly, I'd say it's not a good place to start

09:28.500 --> 09:33.940
I'd say it's kind of getting lost in the weeds and I would want to push back a little bit on your general characterization because

09:34.260 --> 09:40.020
Yeah, you're right that in terms of some very specific questions like what you just articulated

09:40.660 --> 09:42.980
It's helpful to have read some of my other works

09:43.620 --> 09:44.580
but

09:44.580 --> 09:49.700
That's not the main objective of philosophy of the future philosophy of the future has as its aim

09:50.580 --> 09:51.540
a

09:51.540 --> 09:57.140
general introduction of the reader to the fundamental concepts of my philosophical project

09:57.780 --> 10:02.100
Or it can be read as a summary conclusion of my philosophical project

10:02.580 --> 10:08.900
But in any case, what's most important about this book are the central ideas ideas novel ideas that i've developed

10:09.140 --> 10:14.820
Like being bound for freedom spectral revolution world state of emergency phenomenal authorization

10:15.380 --> 10:19.940
Uh and aero sophia. These are you know the the core of the book

10:20.740 --> 10:22.740
In terms of specific

10:23.700 --> 10:30.340
Theses that i've argued in various texts. Yeah, there are brief references to them here

10:30.660 --> 10:35.460
And they're and the reader is also directed to the other books of mine where these

10:36.020 --> 10:42.340
Theses are advanced with more detailed argumentation. So actually the book also functions as a kind of

10:43.060 --> 10:45.540
Uh, like index or lexicon

10:46.100 --> 10:49.540
For my entire corpus where in any given chapter

10:49.780 --> 10:55.140
There are references to other books that i've written if the reader wants more detailed information

10:55.620 --> 10:58.260
Regarding, you know, such and such an argument or thesis

10:58.740 --> 11:05.860
But it's the conceptual structure of my philosophical work as a whole that's being really showcased by this book

11:06.900 --> 11:12.260
Albeit, I also have to add that there is a rather striking conclusion to this book the last chapter

11:12.820 --> 11:14.820
um is a very

11:15.300 --> 11:17.140
dangerously revealing

11:17.140 --> 11:18.740
document which

11:18.740 --> 11:20.420
includes some

11:20.420 --> 11:22.420
lengthy quotations from a

11:23.140 --> 11:25.700
Journal that I wrote around about the age of

11:26.580 --> 11:28.580
23 24

11:28.660 --> 11:33.540
And it shows you the matrix for my entire philosophical project

11:35.380 --> 11:38.740
And what what it is or who it is that really inspired it

11:39.300 --> 11:48.420
As far as a phenomenal authorization goes that is what i'm primarily talking about when it comes to these various references to

11:49.460 --> 11:53.860
You having certain let's say mixes of truths with noble lies

11:54.580 --> 11:59.460
And i'm still trying to understand how exactly this phenomenal authorization would work

12:00.020 --> 12:03.380
Uh, could you possibly guide us through that?

12:03.460 --> 12:08.660
Sure, look the basic idea because I want to stay here with with you know, uh

12:09.620 --> 12:14.340
Large structures and and you know general, you know themes here

12:15.140 --> 12:18.020
Uh, the basic idea behind phenomenal authorization

12:18.500 --> 12:23.620
Develop certain threads from out of the philosophical work of Nietzsche

12:24.580 --> 12:26.100
Heidegger

12:26.100 --> 12:28.100
Wittgenstein

12:28.100 --> 12:31.860
Um, I'd say those are the primary ones also to an extent

12:31.940 --> 12:39.860
Also to an extent it develops certain notions in the work of charles fort fort who was not a philosopher, but who had some very interesting

12:40.980 --> 12:46.420
Epistemological ideas in the course of his study of the paranormal in the early 20th century

12:47.060 --> 12:51.620
And and and to a lesser extent, you know the the philosophy of science of thomas kuhn

12:52.260 --> 12:54.580
And of paul fair robin is also relevant here

12:55.140 --> 12:57.140
But mainly coming from out of Nietzsche

12:57.860 --> 12:59.860
Heidegger and wittgenstein

12:59.860 --> 13:01.860
The idea is this

13:02.420 --> 13:08.820
The and and by the way, heraclitus was incredibly important both to Nietzsche and to uh heidegger

13:09.380 --> 13:12.020
And I would say that the ontology and and uh

13:12.580 --> 13:16.580
And germinal epistemology of heraclitus is also very much in the background here, right?

13:16.980 --> 13:18.980
So the idea is this that

13:20.980 --> 13:26.100
The modern representationalist conception of truth in other words truth as veritas

13:26.820 --> 13:32.100
Where there's an objectively existent structure of reality out there and that

13:32.900 --> 13:36.660
What it means to ascertain knowledge meaning truths about things

13:37.220 --> 13:42.420
Is for us to be able to construct the representational statements in our consciousness

13:42.900 --> 13:44.900
That propositionally refer

13:45.460 --> 13:54.020
To states of affairs in the world and are either accurate representations of those states of affairs or are inaccurate meaning their false propositions

13:54.420 --> 14:01.140
Right, that's the basic conception of truth that began to be developed in the epoch of Descartes

14:01.780 --> 14:07.300
Uh in large part, um as a consequence of the of Descartes dualistic ontology

14:08.020 --> 14:14.980
and it ultimately culminated in uh the representational symbolic logic of like vietnam russell

14:15.460 --> 14:17.460
and the early ludwig vittgenstein

14:17.940 --> 14:19.940
and vittgenstein

14:19.940 --> 14:27.860
Infamously deconstructed that having been the paragon of it himself in the tractatus logical philosophicus

14:28.500 --> 14:31.780
vittgenstein turned on that whole school including his mentor russell

14:32.180 --> 14:37.940
And he deconstructed this representationalist conception of truth in ways that oddly enough

14:38.580 --> 14:40.580
Completely converged with heidegger's

14:41.060 --> 14:44.340
Hermeneutics because these guys had no connection with each other whatsoever

14:44.660 --> 14:48.020
They come from completely different trajectories in the history of philosophy

14:48.340 --> 14:52.180
And yet they converge and how do they converge? Well, they both wind up saying that

14:54.020 --> 14:59.540
Our phenomenological experience of the world in other words the way in which we experience phenomena

15:00.100 --> 15:03.300
And the way in which the world has any meaning for us

15:04.260 --> 15:06.260
Is a function of language

15:06.820 --> 15:12.180
So it's not that there's any objective reality outside our minds and that our minds

15:12.580 --> 15:16.340
ascertain truth by adequately reflecting an objective reality

15:16.900 --> 15:22.420
It's that our subjectivity and what we take to be the objectivity of the world

15:23.140 --> 15:25.140
our relative phenomena

15:26.580 --> 15:31.620
Constructed deconstructed and reconstructed from out of how we use language

15:32.980 --> 15:38.420
And when they're talking about language in this case, they mean it in the ancient greek sense of logos in other words

15:38.820 --> 15:40.820
there is a tapestry of meaning

15:41.620 --> 15:46.180
That is primordial in terms of our experience of phenomena in the world

15:47.620 --> 15:52.420
And it's through this logos that chaos becomes cosmos

15:53.300 --> 15:55.300
so the chaos that that

15:56.260 --> 16:00.920
The chaos that proceeds our consciously processed experience

16:02.260 --> 16:05.940
Becomes a structured array namely a cosmos

16:07.220 --> 16:09.220
through logos

16:10.100 --> 16:13.060
And in this relation between these three terms

16:14.100 --> 16:19.460
chaos and cosmos cosmos coming to be through chaos being processed by logos

16:19.700 --> 16:21.700
There's also a fourth term which is psyche

16:22.580 --> 16:24.260
in other words

16:24.260 --> 16:27.780
Consciousness has integral to that process which we see in quantum physics

16:28.420 --> 16:30.420
and so in an interesting way

16:31.380 --> 16:35.860
What verner heisenberg pointed to in his book physics and philosophy

16:36.260 --> 16:40.420
Which is one of the great, you know texts and I guess what you could call philosophy of physics

16:40.900 --> 16:42.900
What heisenberg

16:42.980 --> 16:44.980
Hitler's nuclear scientist

16:45.620 --> 16:53.060
Points out in that book about quantum theory in terms of the integral role of consciousness

16:53.460 --> 16:55.460
In constituting a structured

16:56.580 --> 17:00.980
World from out of the chaos that is superposition on a quantum scale

17:01.860 --> 17:02.820
and

17:02.820 --> 17:10.340
Which which heisenberg explicitly discusses in that text with reference back to heraclitus and heraclitus is conception of logos

17:10.900 --> 17:13.220
All of that is already implicit

17:13.700 --> 17:19.780
In the ontology and epistemology that heidegger was developing and that bickenstein oddly enough also wound up

17:20.180 --> 17:27.300
Arriving at by a completely different trajectory. And so i'm taking these ideas and synthesizing them and augmenting them

17:28.100 --> 17:29.460
and

17:29.460 --> 17:31.460
using the paranormal

17:31.860 --> 17:32.820
as

17:32.820 --> 17:34.660
an empirical

17:34.660 --> 17:36.660
Let's say raw material

17:36.820 --> 17:38.980
or convenient set of examples

17:39.540 --> 17:41.220
to illustrate

17:41.220 --> 17:42.420
why

17:42.420 --> 17:49.380
The world works this way. I'm being very careful not to say why why reality, you know is this way because the whole point is that

17:49.620 --> 17:51.620
What we take to be reality

17:52.180 --> 17:53.380
objectively

17:53.380 --> 17:59.460
And how we understand ourselves subjectively are co-constructed from out of this interrelationship

17:59.860 --> 18:01.060
between

18:01.060 --> 18:02.100
chaos

18:02.100 --> 18:04.900
logos cosmos and psyche i

18:05.460 --> 18:07.460
describe these four as

18:08.260 --> 18:10.260
ontologically equa primordial

18:10.420 --> 18:15.700
It's a term coming from heidegger equally primordial meaning like the four causes in Aristotle

18:16.020 --> 18:21.220
None of these is more fundamental than the other they represent the kind of fourfold causality

18:22.500 --> 18:26.500
That structures our experience of the world and so okay, so that's the basis

18:27.220 --> 18:29.780
for understanding what phenomenal authorization is because

18:30.500 --> 18:32.500
What that implies

18:32.500 --> 18:33.940
is that

18:33.940 --> 18:35.940
We live in something like a story

18:36.740 --> 18:39.940
We live in a tapestry of meaning in an account a narrative

18:40.260 --> 18:43.140
There is a metanarrative structure to the cosmos itself

18:43.860 --> 18:46.980
And what that suggests is that the world can be written and rewritten

18:48.100 --> 18:52.420
And if you look at some of the more bizarre and distressing

18:53.140 --> 18:57.140
Paranormal phenomena that seem to involve the manipulation of timelines

18:57.540 --> 19:00.420
Or the use of some kind of time travel technology, whether it's

19:01.460 --> 19:05.620
purely mechanical or whether it's actually psychical like remote viewers

19:06.420 --> 19:11.300
Going back to the past and using telekinesis to influence past events to therefore rewrite

19:12.500 --> 19:16.900
Their presence the present that they came from right or to rewrite potential futures

19:17.140 --> 19:22.420
Whether it's entirely mechanical technology or whether it's psychical or whether it's some psychotronic combination thereof

19:23.220 --> 19:26.260
When you look at these kinds of things that are possible

19:27.780 --> 19:29.780
You realize that we live in a revisible world

19:30.980 --> 19:35.620
And it's rewritable the way that the story is rewritable now the thing though is that not everybody's an author

19:36.420 --> 19:39.780
And not all authors have that kind of purchase on

19:41.540 --> 19:45.460
Defining what reality is not just for themselves, but for our whole society

19:45.780 --> 19:50.820
And so I developed this notion of people who are phenomenally authorized meaning

19:51.540 --> 19:52.660
Um

19:52.660 --> 19:58.500
At the diametric opposite pole of what we what we would call these days an npc a non-player character

19:58.980 --> 20:04.260
In a kind of simulacrum in a in a theatrical space in a in a game space

20:05.300 --> 20:08.900
On the opposite pole of of those people who are kind of like part of the

20:09.620 --> 20:11.860
What they're the wallpaper or window dressing

20:12.740 --> 20:16.340
You have people whose agency is such that they are actually

20:16.900 --> 20:20.740
Engaged in defining what reality is for whole society

20:21.220 --> 20:22.420
through their

20:22.420 --> 20:28.900
Creative endeavors whether it's literal writing or whether it's logos in the form of artistic production or

20:29.220 --> 20:32.180
You know cinema or music and and so on and so forth

20:32.660 --> 20:36.500
So you have this idea that there's a relationship between

20:37.620 --> 20:43.700
Authorship again including in all the arts all the modes of of poesis or creative production

20:44.580 --> 20:48.260
Authorship in that sense is related to phenomena

20:48.900 --> 20:50.900
So phenomena are

20:51.780 --> 20:54.180
phenomenally authorized by these author

20:55.140 --> 20:56.740
types

20:56.740 --> 21:01.620
But then there's also a kind of authority that that represents which I argue

21:02.740 --> 21:08.420
Far exceeds political authority or you could say is more fundamental than political authority

21:08.820 --> 21:15.060
Where the political leaders of one or another country are relatively insignificant

21:15.460 --> 21:22.180
Compared to the movers and shakers who define the welton shong the worldview of that

21:22.660 --> 21:27.940
Culture who set the standard for what's even going to count as real or unreal

21:28.260 --> 21:31.460
You know for a given people which as you mentioned in your book

21:31.940 --> 21:38.500
Nowadays unfortunately is uh in the power of all of these social media gossipers

21:39.060 --> 21:43.780
Who back in the day would have just been relegated to gossiping in the back of the church during sunday

21:44.180 --> 21:49.860
And now they're the ones that seem to wheel the power and bring people into the lowest common denominator

21:50.340 --> 21:51.460
So

21:51.460 --> 21:57.700
I don't know if now would be a good time to talk about what that future holds because i'm still very intrigued by

21:58.020 --> 22:02.980
What the possibilities are here of wielding this kind of authority and authorship

22:03.300 --> 22:06.260
So whichever direction you would prefer to go to please let me know

22:08.660 --> 22:11.780
Well, I think that you know, it's fair to say

22:12.740 --> 22:19.700
That my philosophical project as a whole which is reflected in a really condensed and crystallized form in this book philosophy of the future

22:22.020 --> 22:29.620
Uh owes a great deal to nichea and and where nichea did not serve as an explicit inspiration

22:29.940 --> 22:34.180
it's consonant with a lot of what nichea was doing and and um

22:35.140 --> 22:41.940
Uh represents a further development of the same trajectory of thought that nichea was pursuing

22:42.580 --> 22:49.860
And nichea had this vision of what he called frankly artist tyrants or artist philosophers

22:50.500 --> 22:53.300
Uh who would wind up defining

22:54.740 --> 22:59.460
Life on this earth in terms that exceeded the limits of the human condition

23:00.340 --> 23:02.340
these are his uber mention

23:02.660 --> 23:03.860
and

23:03.860 --> 23:10.180
He has this notion that you know, there are these the highest men of history who are great geniuses and that basically

23:10.980 --> 23:12.980
historical development throughout

23:14.020 --> 23:18.260
Throughout time should be seen in terms of these mountain peaks

23:19.300 --> 23:20.660
that are each

23:20.660 --> 23:27.220
The contributions of one or another genius and that these higher men are progenitors of the coming overmen

23:27.860 --> 23:29.860
just as

23:29.940 --> 23:31.940
just as the last men

23:32.180 --> 23:35.380
Uh who are increasingly degenerate

23:36.580 --> 23:38.580
lazy

23:38.580 --> 23:43.860
People who are feckless and without any particular motivation people who become

23:44.660 --> 23:47.540
Ultimately captured by the event horizon of nihilism

23:48.340 --> 23:52.260
that these uh last men are the harbingers of

23:53.620 --> 23:55.620
A race of untermention

23:55.700 --> 24:01.780
Subhumans who are really no longer going to be human and we're going to wind up being integrated into a machinery of

24:01.940 --> 24:07.140
Reduction nichea has this vision as any today when you think in terms of the pace at which

24:08.100 --> 24:10.100
Developments are taking place in artificial intelligence

24:11.780 --> 24:16.260
And I mean, I don't know if you've seen what gpt 4o can do, but it's actually unsettling

24:17.060 --> 24:18.580
uh, so

24:18.580 --> 24:23.620
Even for me who's written about this for years like the rate at which this is happening is astonishing

24:23.860 --> 24:26.100
Well, it was showing your your past as well

24:26.580 --> 24:29.700
Uh possible past. I mean when you were uh using it

24:30.660 --> 24:33.300
Yeah, well, we can come to that too. I mean so

24:34.660 --> 24:41.700
But then when you combine ai with gene editing like for example, there are stories coming out today about how

24:43.620 --> 24:50.980
One of the biggest problems with genetic engineering throughout these years that it's that it's been uh worked on by various companies is that

24:51.940 --> 24:54.900
A lot of genes have secondary and tertiary functions

24:55.540 --> 24:56.820
which if you

24:56.820 --> 24:58.100
tinker with

24:58.100 --> 25:02.260
The primary function of the gene that it is you're trying to manipulate in a person's genome

25:02.580 --> 25:06.740
You wind up shutting off, you know some secondary or tertiary function

25:06.820 --> 25:12.500
You don't understand well and that's going to become a problem for the organism. It could even be potentially lethal

25:13.140 --> 25:19.140
So it requires extremely complex mapping of the multiple functions of any particular gene

25:19.780 --> 25:25.380
It's been very difficult for us to do that which has meant that hitherto genetic engineering has been very dangerous

25:25.780 --> 25:32.820
Well ai has cracked it ai has now mapped all of the secondary tertiary whatever functions of every gene

25:33.460 --> 25:36.980
And it can do an analysis of exactly, you know

25:37.700 --> 25:42.820
What benefit and what risks there are to making a particular edit in the genome using crisper?

25:43.380 --> 25:48.500
So these technologies are becoming increasingly convergent in ways where you could see how

25:50.020 --> 25:52.020
the vast majority of

25:52.900 --> 25:56.900
You know people without any particular will or motivation

25:57.700 --> 25:59.700
aspiration without any

26:00.100 --> 26:04.980
Capacity to think for themselves or to pursue visions in a self-directed way

26:05.540 --> 26:07.540
they're just going to wind up

26:07.940 --> 26:11.700
being integrated into a machinery of production and

26:12.580 --> 26:17.060
At the very best at the very best through cybernetic technology

26:18.100 --> 26:19.300
and

26:19.300 --> 26:21.300
they're going to wind up serving

26:21.780 --> 26:23.780
the purposes of a group of

26:25.060 --> 26:29.700
As Nietzsche put it spiritual aristocrats who are renaissance men in the truest sense

26:30.260 --> 26:32.260
renaissance men and women

26:32.820 --> 26:34.340
who

26:34.340 --> 26:41.700
Are visionaries who are geniuses who who have more ideas than they know what to do with and who will take these emerging technology

26:41.780 --> 26:46.340
First of all, they'll augment themselves biologically, but then also use artificial intelligence

26:47.300 --> 26:49.300
to actualize

26:49.540 --> 26:51.540
astonishing visions that

26:52.020 --> 26:56.500
Have hitherto been deemed impossible. They're going to make the impossible possible

26:56.980 --> 27:01.320
using these singularity level technologies and that's phenomenal authorization

27:02.260 --> 27:04.260
okay, but

27:05.140 --> 27:07.140
You know, if we just look at the state of the world today

27:07.220 --> 27:13.780
I think it's fair to say that that phenomenal phenomenal authorization is not going to extend to the general population. It's it's going to be

27:14.580 --> 27:22.580
A phenomenally authorized group of individuals who fight fight for their autonomy and for their creative power and genius

27:23.220 --> 27:27.140
You don't really see the possibility like you were talking about with zero point energy

27:27.620 --> 27:33.700
Being able to be in anybody's backyard this same kind of AI technology where you could press a button

27:33.860 --> 27:36.420
All of a sudden you're bigger faster smarter

27:36.420 --> 27:39.700
You know, you become the uber mensch even though you start out as the intermensch

27:39.860 --> 27:43.220
You don't really see the npc people as you were calling them

27:43.700 --> 27:46.980
embrace that here's the issue left the issue is

27:48.500 --> 27:50.500
That in some totally

27:50.820 --> 27:54.340
unhistorical abstract hypothetical scenario

27:54.900 --> 28:00.500
Where we didn't have all the ideological baggage that we have in the world that would be entirely possible

28:01.220 --> 28:07.380
However, as we'll get around to discussing by the end of this conversation, you know in terms of what's going on domestically

28:08.100 --> 28:10.100
and geopolitically

28:10.900 --> 28:14.660
The number of retards who are subscribing to

28:15.860 --> 28:17.220
traditionalist

28:17.220 --> 28:21.780
regressive ideologies in the world today or to forms of leftism

28:22.260 --> 28:25.540
That are so nihilistic and cynical that they're actually dialectically

28:26.340 --> 28:34.180
Empowering these various forms of retardation is such that the vast majority of the world population has foreclosed its participation

28:34.420 --> 28:35.940
in such a process

28:35.940 --> 28:37.940
We are 10 to 20 years away

28:38.580 --> 28:43.380
At one point I thought we were 30 years away from the singularity the rate at which AI technology is developing today

28:43.460 --> 28:47.220
I can tell you I I don't think we're more than 10 to 15 years away from the singularity

28:48.260 --> 28:52.100
And we just don't have any time left for these people. We don't have the time left

28:52.980 --> 28:55.460
When you have a vast majority of people

28:56.500 --> 29:00.980
Look, Islam is going to be the dominant religion on this planet by 2075

29:01.620 --> 29:03.620
If current demographic trends continue

29:04.180 --> 29:06.180
Right and then we've got

29:07.140 --> 29:09.140
The russian orthodox

29:09.380 --> 29:11.380
Through people like dugin

29:11.460 --> 29:14.100
aligned with these islamic traditionalists

29:15.060 --> 29:19.460
And then we have china financing both of them and militarily backing them

29:20.020 --> 29:25.300
Right. I mean i'll come to this later. Yeah, it was it was discovered recently by an independent think tank

29:26.100 --> 29:34.100
that the worst of the pro palestine protests in america where they were actually targeting infrastructure blocking roads and

29:34.180 --> 29:41.700
Bridges and taking over university campuses. Those were funded by china through a series of false front organizations

29:42.180 --> 29:47.620
So you've got the chinese behind these muslims and you've got the russian orthodox

29:48.980 --> 29:52.900
Power cabal of putin and dugin also supporting them

29:53.380 --> 30:01.460
Right and then all the leftists in europe and america the socialist parties in europe and the sjw's in the united states

30:02.180 --> 30:06.420
Are also they're literally in some cases converting to islam on these university

30:06.900 --> 30:09.780
Uh, palestine encampments, right? That's that's on the left and on the right

30:09.780 --> 30:16.340
You've got people like andrew tate who's also converting young men into islam because they're very dissatisfied with the way things are going now

30:16.820 --> 30:20.580
In europe and then in america. We have the the retards of the bible belt

30:21.460 --> 30:23.460
Yeah

30:23.860 --> 30:29.700
Well, there is this new movement right now. I'm sure you've heard about you know, like the uh, jesus's uh, jesus's king jesus's lord

30:30.020 --> 30:32.020
it's their way of

30:32.020 --> 30:34.500
reaffirming this much more of a warrior

30:35.060 --> 30:41.380
type christianity as opposed to like the soft christianity that i'm not a big fan of either as far as you know, like the

30:42.020 --> 30:45.700
sjw type christians that i'm sure you've seen a lot of in minhatten

30:46.820 --> 30:51.860
Yeah, well, they're you know, just because there are nods with one another doesn't make either of them our allies

30:51.860 --> 30:57.780
They're both enemies. They're both mortal enemies and look when you have people like steve bannon even steve bannon

30:58.100 --> 31:01.860
Coming out and arguing that server farms should be bombed by the us air force

31:03.140 --> 31:08.500
Then you know, what hope is there that any of these christians in the bible belt are going to

31:08.980 --> 31:15.460
Support our continued advancement toward the technological singularity or availed themselves of the opportunity to use this technology

31:15.860 --> 31:19.620
In order to become ubermanshin, right? I mean no that's not going to happen

31:19.620 --> 31:24.820
They're going to band together with the russian orthodox and in some cases they're even going to band together with the moslems

31:25.780 --> 31:31.380
In order to lead some luddite traditionalist rebellion against the advent of the singularity

31:32.100 --> 31:33.060
well

31:33.060 --> 31:35.940
But uh going back to how exactly this

31:36.980 --> 31:40.340
There's some noise from the outside here. Give me one second. Sure, absolutely

31:41.300 --> 31:44.820
Yes, so that we don't wind up with any disruption. I'll be right back sounds good

31:45.140 --> 31:50.980
And uh while jason is away. I just want to remind everybody here if this is your first time watching break the rules

Be sure to like subscribe comment

31:53.780 --> 32:00.660
But also check out the other videos because I have videos with thinkers like kurdus yarvin mensius moldbug

32:01.060 --> 32:04.820
Uh jason reservoir johnny as you can see over here uber boyo

32:05.380 --> 32:10.980
uh neil nostic informant all kinds of an amazing uh sticks hexan hammer 666

32:11.460 --> 32:15.220
uh britney venti who uh hopefully should be coming back soon as well

32:15.700 --> 32:18.420
So i'm also doing right now these uh

32:19.220 --> 32:24.900
presentations these streams in uh my Manhattan studio in new york city

32:25.460 --> 32:30.980
And what i'm planning on doing is that if you guys become patrons patreon.com slash break the rules

32:31.220 --> 32:37.540
And if you become specifically 20 dollar patrons and you guys happen to live within the new york sydney vicinity

32:38.020 --> 32:41.460
Then you know after making sure everything is kosher, you know

32:41.540 --> 32:47.860
Just so we don't have people from mental institutions coming in then i would definitely love to invite you guys over to these

32:48.660 --> 32:50.020
taped

32:50.020 --> 32:53.860
Uh recordings with uh the various interesting guests including dr.

32:53.940 --> 32:57.380
Giorgiani that i'm going to be having in the coming months

32:57.700 --> 33:04.740
So once again patreon.com slash break the rules go there right now and uh you guys are going to get a lot of good stuff

33:05.060 --> 33:11.620
Even uh if you're not in new york city, you're going to get exclusive episodes including a q&a with georgiorgiani

33:12.100 --> 33:17.860
Which you guys could watch uh right now once again, that's patreon.com slash break the rules

33:18.420 --> 33:26.180
Go there or be square. Anyway, uh jason we are back over here and uh, yeah, let's uh, let's keep uh, let's keep going

33:26.180 --> 33:27.860
So as far as

33:27.860 --> 33:34.260
What exactly are the limitations to changing and i know you don't like using the word reality

33:34.580 --> 33:39.700
But if we're talking about overcoming the situation we're in right now with this philosophy of the future

33:40.180 --> 33:46.420
We still have to know what the certain limitations are obviously right now. I'm not going to be able to just go through a wall

33:46.660 --> 33:49.540
I'm not going to be able to teleport myself back in time

33:50.020 --> 33:53.780
But what are the things that people are able to use?

33:54.340 --> 33:56.340
Right here and right now

33:56.420 --> 34:01.300
In order to change things things that may go beyond just i don't know just being uh

34:01.940 --> 34:07.940
Interesting thinker and philosopher and spreading messages because obviously, you know, we all know that we can do that

34:08.260 --> 34:11.700
But as far as going beyond that what exactly is there?

34:12.420 --> 34:18.100
Well, let me be very practical with you. Okay, um, and also I have to say that

34:18.820 --> 34:23.860
You have to make a caveat there in terms of what you mean by people people can you know, what can people do?

34:23.860 --> 34:25.860
Like most people are utterly oblivious

34:26.100 --> 34:32.180
Uh and or captivated by one of these aforementioned ideologies that are that are responsible for destroying our civilization

34:32.740 --> 34:37.700
And so most people are not going to you know, take the initiative to do to use any

34:38.660 --> 34:42.100
Uh extraordinary abilities to potentially

34:45.060 --> 34:47.060
Make us uh make us uh

34:47.940 --> 34:52.100
Uh to potentially make a better future than the one that we're headed for right now, right?

34:52.500 --> 34:55.940
But what can people with with initiative do? Well

34:57.460 --> 35:02.580
Look, this is a bit of a dangerous game, but remote viewing the future for example is a

35:03.620 --> 35:06.900
Imminently possible thing. It's been done many times

35:08.100 --> 35:10.420
And so there's a case to be made

35:12.580 --> 35:18.420
For training oneself in remote viewing to the point that one could look around the corner

35:18.980 --> 35:24.580
And and see some of the challenges and crises that we're going to be facing in the near future

35:25.060 --> 35:29.380
And grasp what caused them so that we can

35:30.340 --> 35:31.540
address

35:31.540 --> 35:38.260
Those causes before they wind up unfolding into one or another catastrophe that we're headed toward right now

35:38.580 --> 35:42.180
Okay, so precognitive remote viewing is a thing. It's been used for

35:42.900 --> 35:46.420
Oh, I don't know 45 years at this point

35:47.300 --> 35:49.620
effectively by various governments

35:50.260 --> 35:52.260
and now by the corporate sector

35:52.660 --> 35:54.100
and

35:54.100 --> 35:57.060
So that's one thing that people could do is to train that ability

35:57.460 --> 36:00.020
But see that goes back to a point that I've made

36:00.820 --> 36:05.620
Throughout my work from the beginning from Prometheus and out were from Prometheus and Atlas onwards

36:07.540 --> 36:09.220
Is that suppose

36:09.220 --> 36:11.220
you're trying to remote view

36:12.180 --> 36:16.980
The outcome of the second American civil war, which I'm increasingly convinced that we're headed into

36:17.940 --> 36:19.940
or the outcome of the third world war

36:20.740 --> 36:23.940
And your objective is to find out let's say whether, you know

36:24.580 --> 36:29.140
Russia winds up in a favorable position at the end of world war three because let's say France

36:29.540 --> 36:32.500
Leaves NATO or whatever or you're trying to find out

36:33.140 --> 36:35.940
What kind of government exists in the United States in

36:36.740 --> 36:38.420
2028 right

36:38.420 --> 36:41.460
But as part of seeing that future

36:42.180 --> 36:46.740
You also see what happens in terms of your relationship with your wife

36:48.100 --> 36:51.380
Or you see the death of certain of your children

36:54.020 --> 36:58.020
How will that impact your life how capable will you be of dealing with that

36:58.580 --> 37:01.620
What changes will result in your immediate situation?

37:02.340 --> 37:05.220
As a consequence of that so, you know, I think

37:07.060 --> 37:13.940
Many people even those who have the initiative to go and train themselves in the use of such abilities many of those people

37:14.340 --> 37:20.820
Are not prepared for the psychological consequences of say seeing some things in their own personal future

37:21.220 --> 37:23.220
That might be part of

37:23.780 --> 37:27.140
A glimpse into our social or political future

37:27.860 --> 37:33.620
Even if they have the ability to prevent that somewhat from happening if they know about in advance in a way

37:33.620 --> 37:35.620
It's kind of empowering too

37:37.060 --> 37:43.620
Here's the thing about that love is that look just um looking at my own life to give you a very personal answer

37:45.460 --> 37:47.060
If

37:47.060 --> 37:49.700
you were if if let's say 20 years ago

37:50.660 --> 37:54.420
I had pre-cognitively remote viewed certain things that happened

37:55.060 --> 37:58.180
In my life particularly involving relationships with

37:59.220 --> 38:01.220
certain individuals

38:01.860 --> 38:03.860
I might have

38:03.940 --> 38:07.220
At that time with the psychology that I had in the moment

38:08.580 --> 38:11.700
Endeavored to prevent those events from taking place

38:12.420 --> 38:14.420
or let's say certain relationships from

38:14.980 --> 38:17.860
deteriorating in certain ways and so forth, right?

38:18.020 --> 38:24.660
Well by doing so I would also have prevented myself from reaching the place that I'm at today

38:26.260 --> 38:28.260
And I can say that

38:29.700 --> 38:31.700
frankly

38:32.180 --> 38:34.180
Looking at the big picture

38:34.980 --> 38:36.980
and thinking

38:37.140 --> 38:39.140
About this from the deepest level

38:39.940 --> 38:41.940
I have no regrets

38:42.660 --> 38:45.700
And I'm not sure that the Giorgiani of 20 years ago

38:46.580 --> 38:48.580
would have had the insight

38:49.380 --> 38:52.260
Or the wisdom to understand why

38:53.700 --> 38:55.940
It was perhaps important for those things to happen

38:57.220 --> 38:59.220
So it's a very burdensome thing

39:00.020 --> 39:02.580
to see elements of your own future

39:03.700 --> 39:06.200
And to think that you'll be able to handle

39:07.380 --> 39:11.300
The question of whether or not you should act to change certain things, right?

39:12.660 --> 39:15.060
So so it makes it very hard. It makes it very hard

39:16.020 --> 39:20.580
You know to to expect even a small minority of people with great initiative

39:21.220 --> 39:22.740
and motivation

39:22.740 --> 39:26.820
To be able to train themselves in these abilities for the sake of

39:27.540 --> 39:28.820
averting

39:28.820 --> 39:31.540
You know catastrophes on a social or political scale

39:33.380 --> 39:36.260
I see what you mean does it necessarily

39:36.900 --> 39:38.420
need to

39:38.420 --> 39:41.620
Be a cultivation of those future seeing

39:42.340 --> 39:43.220
skills

39:43.220 --> 39:47.140
If one goes down the path of training their concentration

39:47.540 --> 39:50.900
Or could a person decide you know what I don't want to see the future

39:51.380 --> 39:54.100
But I do want to be able to do certain things

39:54.660 --> 39:56.660
That go beyond being a

39:57.300 --> 39:59.780
Regular human being as I was before

40:00.100 --> 40:07.220
Can people choose or is it a matter of once you start going in one direction all of a sudden everything else just opens up like a sponge

40:09.220 --> 40:12.580
I think one. Yeah, you know, I think it's possible to choose but

40:13.940 --> 40:15.460
But I think that

40:15.460 --> 40:20.020
There's only a certain latitude for control there because psi phenomena in general

40:20.420 --> 40:22.420
Are a function of the subconscious

40:22.820 --> 40:25.620
And so and this has been a theme throughout the course of my work

40:26.180 --> 40:27.780
including in my

40:27.780 --> 40:29.780
fiction quote-unquote

40:30.340 --> 40:32.340
The idea that

40:33.300 --> 40:36.260
In order to exercise phenomenal authorization

40:36.340 --> 40:39.300
You need to make the subconscious conscious to a certain extent

40:39.700 --> 40:43.700
And you need to be able to project conscious will into the domain of the subconscious

40:44.180 --> 40:49.220
So there's a certain deconstruction of the barrier between the conscious mind and the subconscious that needs to take place

40:49.860 --> 40:51.860
and and a certain

40:51.940 --> 40:53.460
uh

40:53.460 --> 40:55.460
a certain

40:55.460 --> 40:57.460
capacity to

40:58.900 --> 41:00.900
Will

41:01.140 --> 41:03.640
Processes that are usually subconscious

41:04.580 --> 41:08.740
Like people do in lucid dreams. I mean dream states are subconscious states

41:09.300 --> 41:15.380
But there's a phenomenon of lucid dreaming where people exercise willpower in dreams and it's not coincidental

41:16.100 --> 41:20.660
That remote viewers in certain protocols are first trained in how to

41:21.380 --> 41:23.380
uh become lucid dreamers

41:24.020 --> 41:29.860
Is there a certain timeline that you can give to somebody who is interested in taking the plunge?

41:30.420 --> 41:36.260
And uh acquiring these skills. How long would it usually take for someone who?

41:36.900 --> 41:38.900
Well, would be committed to such a thing

41:40.260 --> 41:44.500
You know, I don't have the personal expertise to to comment on that directly

41:44.580 --> 41:49.460
But I can tell you what some of the best remote viewers have told me. I mean for example, you know

41:49.540 --> 41:52.580
Lynn Buchanan who I had some level of connection with

41:53.060 --> 41:55.940
um, Lynn Buchanan has said repeatedly that

41:56.980 --> 41:59.700
uh, first of all, it's always possible to improve

42:00.580 --> 42:05.140
But that some of the best remote viewers who he's trained, you know

42:05.300 --> 42:09.780
He was the chief trainer for the cia dod remote viewing program for a while

42:09.940 --> 42:13.700
so he trained all the other guys who were the best in the program and

42:14.580 --> 42:20.020
He was of the view that uh, it really takes decades to produce an ace remote viewer

42:20.900 --> 42:22.900
now, you know with things like ai

42:23.860 --> 42:26.660
and neural link type psychotronic technology

42:27.380 --> 42:33.300
And potentially genetic augmentation because actually it's been found that there are certain genetic correlates

42:33.780 --> 42:35.780
Of high aptitude for psi

42:36.180 --> 42:42.580
Right. So ai seems to be an ability that has a genetic basis to some extent just like

42:43.060 --> 42:46.900
aptitude to become a virtuoso musician has genetic basis just like

42:47.380 --> 42:50.580
Becoming an olympic class swimmer has some genetic correlate to it

42:50.820 --> 42:55.060
Some people are going to be more or less genetically predisposed for high level of ability

42:55.540 --> 42:57.540
in in uh in these

42:57.780 --> 43:04.580
Various fields and the same is true with psi. It's very similar to the exercise of sports ability and the trainability of sports ability

43:04.660 --> 43:07.540
Right. Like anyone can be trained to do it to some level

43:07.940 --> 43:11.060
Anyone can, you know, not everyone's going to be a basketball player

43:11.540 --> 43:15.220
No, but everyone can play basketball, but you might suck. Yeah. Yeah

43:15.380 --> 43:20.900
So so the thing is there's a certain degree of genetic, uh, correlation and if now

43:21.460 --> 43:23.140
We bring genetic

43:23.140 --> 43:28.420
Engineering or gene editing into the mix and we combine it with neural link and we combine it with ai protocols

43:28.580 --> 43:31.540
That can develop much more effective ways to learn remote viewing

43:31.780 --> 43:34.340
Maybe you could cut that time down drastically

43:34.740 --> 43:38.340
And it's a question of a few years rather than, you know, a decade or two

43:38.900 --> 43:43.540
But it's it requires a significant investment of time and energy in any case. That's for sure

43:43.780 --> 43:48.580
Do you also a last question regarding this, uh, ascendance? Do you also see a, uh,

43:49.460 --> 43:56.020
usefulness of training the body in conjunction with the mind as far as exercises to make the body stronger

43:56.500 --> 44:00.740
To, uh, you know, do certain tantric exercises as well to, uh,

44:01.140 --> 44:07.060
Work on, you know, the chakras as they refer to, uh, that in the event of a danta and so on and so forth

44:07.940 --> 44:14.900
Absolutely. I think that all of that, you know, should be part of a future Promethean society. No doubt about it. I mean, you know, uh,

44:15.860 --> 44:18.740
I'm a philosopher where I've chosen to, you know,

44:19.220 --> 44:23.220
Place my energy and my time in emphasis thus far at least in my life

44:24.100 --> 44:25.540
is is, uh,

44:25.540 --> 44:26.740
you know

44:26.740 --> 44:33.540
Very much in line with how people like heidegger or jampolsacht or, you know, I don't know, uh

44:34.100 --> 44:39.860
Wittgenstein lived their lives, right? I mean, we philosophers are a certain type, right? Yeah

44:40.580 --> 44:46.820
So and then and then I have a literary dimension to me, which which, you know, gives me an affinity to people like kafka and

44:47.380 --> 44:49.940
Uh, I don't know kamu and and and others

44:50.500 --> 44:54.020
So I I'm that type of person. We're not going to be seeing Dr.

44:54.020 --> 44:58.340
Giorgiani, uh, doing like a deadlifts and squats, uh, you know in the gym, uh,

44:58.980 --> 45:06.820
Or are we or are we? Well, look, I'm at an interesting turning point in my life, frankly, because this book philosophy of the future

45:07.220 --> 45:09.460
Represents a kind of culmination, right?

45:09.940 --> 45:17.060
The fundamental structure of my philosophical project is complete now. That doesn't mean that I won't all of a sudden have a

45:17.860 --> 45:20.740
shift of perspective or, you know, new ideas

45:21.220 --> 45:25.700
Might not dawn on me and revolutionize my work in some way that happened with wittgenstein

45:26.100 --> 45:31.940
You know, heidegger also had some dramatic developments in his later thinking. Uh, so yeah, sure. That's possible

45:32.420 --> 45:34.820
But I am at a point of culmination

45:35.220 --> 45:40.900
And also the colossus project represents in a in a tangible sense a significant development in my life

45:40.980 --> 45:47.700
And probably changes of condition in my life that will afford me the opportunity to maybe spend time and energy doing some

45:48.180 --> 45:54.340
Uh, other types of things how much it in, you know, for example, I certainly would love to go back to skiing

45:54.340 --> 45:56.980
It was my favorite sport uh earlier in my life

45:57.780 --> 46:01.780
And so, yeah, you know, I might I might put my energy in other directions

46:01.860 --> 46:03.860
If I had to guess though, I would say that

46:04.420 --> 46:10.100
If there's going to be a shift of energy and focus to some extent a lot of it will go into art and um art

46:11.060 --> 46:14.980
Most likely in the sense of cinema or a visualization of my

46:16.100 --> 46:17.780
literary work

46:17.780 --> 46:19.780
That's I think very likely

46:20.020 --> 46:25.700
Speaking of which by the way the cover for your book and the design of the book that was all you philosophy of the future

46:25.780 --> 46:31.140
That's true. That's true. But I don't rule out. Let's say learning remote beyond. I don't rule that out at all

46:33.300 --> 46:36.580
And you know, there's some people who I'm sure hope that that never happened

46:37.780 --> 46:39.780
Going around in the ether

46:40.580 --> 46:44.340
That that might be problematic for some of the vested interests in the world

46:44.660 --> 46:48.980
But where exactly we go from here because we were just talking about

46:49.460 --> 46:51.860
psychic abilities, but as far as

46:52.420 --> 46:57.940
Defining reality itself as far as this destructive departure of world review warfare

46:58.580 --> 47:04.340
When it comes to changing what exactly this whole thing we're experiencing is

47:04.820 --> 47:07.860
I'm very fascinated by what that exactly would entail

47:08.260 --> 47:11.940
But also what exactly is currently around us because

47:12.500 --> 47:18.980
I do recall you were talking about how all of these galaxies and galaxy clusters and so and so forth

47:19.220 --> 47:25.460
These are things for us to observe because we're looking out in order to see them that may be what they are

47:25.860 --> 47:28.660
But then the question is well, where exactly does the

47:29.220 --> 47:32.260
Real part end? Well, not real. I know you don't believe in real

47:32.260 --> 47:37.940
But where exactly does the part that we can actually interact with it and there are other life forms there

47:38.260 --> 47:43.060
Where does that end? Does it end on mars? Does it end on, you know, the uh word cloud?

47:45.540 --> 47:47.540
You mean what's the edge of uh

47:47.780 --> 47:52.500
Uh, what's the edge of phenomenal experience in this world? Yes. Yes

47:55.220 --> 47:59.460
Well, I've thought a bit about this and I've discussed it in a couple of my books

48:00.580 --> 48:02.580
to begin with

48:02.580 --> 48:04.580
There are aspects of quantum theory

48:05.780 --> 48:07.220
such as

48:07.220 --> 48:09.220
wave particle duality

48:10.980 --> 48:14.500
And the fact and the fact that a probability distribution on a quantum level

48:15.460 --> 48:23.620
Never actualizes as a particle with a particular location until and unless it's been observed meaning measured by a

48:24.420 --> 48:26.100
sentient

48:26.100 --> 48:27.220
observer

48:27.220 --> 48:31.620
And I I think that the people who push back against that, you know, that was the position of Niles Bohr

48:32.020 --> 48:36.260
and uh, Werner Heisenberg and all the great, uh, quantum physicists in the

48:37.220 --> 48:42.820
Early years and I think that these people reductionist materialists who are trying to push back against that and say that

48:43.220 --> 48:47.300
Wave collapses can take place without sentient observers are trading in a bunch of nonsense

48:47.540 --> 48:56.100
They invent hidden variables and string theories and all this other bullshit to claim that there are deterministic processes that underlie

48:57.380 --> 48:58.420
the

48:58.420 --> 49:00.020
the

49:00.020 --> 49:02.260
That underlie the probabilistic

49:03.060 --> 49:10.420
Uh quality of quantum phenomena, and I I don't there's no empirical evidence for that all of these are

49:10.900 --> 49:12.020
Uh

49:12.020 --> 49:14.660
purely speculative mathematical formalisms

49:15.540 --> 49:18.820
Okay, that are just intended to give these people a sense of psychological security

49:19.060 --> 49:22.900
There was a sorry to interrupt. There was also a physicist who said that it was the

49:23.700 --> 49:25.700
I getting hit by

49:26.260 --> 49:30.180
Something that caused this change to occur as opposed to observation itself

49:31.860 --> 49:37.940
Yeah, well, that's moronic because the I is a structure made up of quantum particles ultimately just as the brain is

49:38.180 --> 49:43.700
So what's causing the wave collapse, right? I mean quantum particles aren't causing other quantum part

49:44.740 --> 49:46.740
Quantum particles aren't causing wave

49:47.380 --> 49:49.380
Distributions to collapse into particles

49:49.940 --> 49:54.420
An observer is doing that and so you just can't get consciousness from out of the mix there

49:54.740 --> 49:58.180
You cannot you know extricate the psyche from

49:58.900 --> 50:02.660
The cosmos as it's manifesting through logos

50:03.540 --> 50:07.220
Out of chaos psyche is an inextricable element in this process here

50:07.460 --> 50:12.660
But anyway, what I was going to say was that there are aspects of quantum theory like this, you know

50:13.380 --> 50:19.540
Wave article duality or rather the fact that everything is only a probability distribution until it's observed

50:20.180 --> 50:23.620
Which is similar to what we call conditional rendering in

50:24.260 --> 50:25.540
video game

50:25.540 --> 50:32.020
Programming where you don't render something that's not being observed by any one or another player in the game

50:32.420 --> 50:34.420
Because it's just in elegant

50:34.580 --> 50:36.820
And by the way, I have a silent conversation about this the other day

50:38.180 --> 50:40.180
um

50:40.180 --> 50:41.860
Where look

50:41.860 --> 50:43.460
Someone might

50:43.460 --> 50:47.860
Think that the reason for that is that there's a limited amount of energy and processing power

50:49.460 --> 50:51.460
But that's not necessarily the case

50:51.940 --> 50:53.940
If you're designing

50:54.420 --> 50:56.100
a game

50:56.100 --> 50:58.100
You might just

50:58.100 --> 51:02.500
Employ conditional rendering because it would be in elegant not to do so

51:02.820 --> 51:07.460
I mean like when you're building a stage set for a theatrical production, right?

51:07.940 --> 51:09.940
And there's there has to be a house

51:10.340 --> 51:12.340
on the on the set

51:12.740 --> 51:15.540
What moron goes and builds a complete living room?

51:17.780 --> 51:20.340
That the audience is never going to see any of the actors

51:20.900 --> 51:25.380
Enter into right you don't do that. That's not the way it's method acting jason. That's what that is

51:25.460 --> 51:28.900
You know, you got to get full immersion into but yeah, I understand what you're saying

51:29.220 --> 51:33.860
Good method actors wouldn't actually even do that to get into the role. But in any case, yes

51:34.740 --> 51:36.740
So I just think it's a question of elegance

51:36.900 --> 51:37.700
but

51:37.700 --> 51:44.020
features of quantum theory like that or quantum entanglement where you know, if you interact with

51:44.900 --> 51:50.580
You take two particles that have had interaction with one another and you do a measurement on one of them

51:51.060 --> 51:55.700
It actually affects the other one that's now moved to a discrete location

51:56.260 --> 51:58.260
And so these two particles appear to be

51:58.900 --> 52:06.820
Entangled in a way where anything that affects one of them causes a change in the other one. Well, there's also a process like that

52:07.620 --> 52:08.740
in

52:08.740 --> 52:10.020
the

52:10.020 --> 52:12.180
coordinated change of pixels

52:12.820 --> 52:13.940
in the

52:13.940 --> 52:17.860
Rendering of a video game where certain pixels are coded to basically

52:18.500 --> 52:21.220
Change simultaneously change their state simultaneously

52:21.780 --> 52:26.500
And so there are these various features that appear similar to programming code

52:27.780 --> 52:29.780
In the design of simulacra

52:30.420 --> 52:34.580
And then there are other things that are even more bizarre like we've discussed in another episode

52:35.140 --> 52:38.260
That the number 26 keeps popping up at different scales

52:38.980 --> 52:42.180
In the cosmos whether it's in terms of the distance between

52:42.580 --> 52:47.060
You know the or the diameter of the moon or you know the distance between

52:48.020 --> 52:57.940
Our solar system and the center of the galaxy or the time that it takes for our solar system to circumnavigate the galaxy

52:59.380 --> 53:06.580
These are all multiples of the number 26 for some reason. Well, that doesn't make any sense in a in a

53:07.860 --> 53:09.860
physical cosmos the way that

53:10.100 --> 53:12.020
reductionist materialists think about

53:12.100 --> 53:18.420
You know the the universe that they imagine us to be living in nor for that matter does the efficacy of zodiacal astrology

53:18.660 --> 53:21.060
Which is something I've touched on in numerous works of mine

53:21.380 --> 53:24.180
The fact that there's good scientific evidence for example

53:24.740 --> 53:29.220
The work of michelle gaughan showing that people do going to career paths

53:29.700 --> 53:36.260
Influenced by you know the position of the stars at the time of their or position of the at least the planets at the time of their birth

53:36.580 --> 53:43.060
Well, that suggests that we're living in a kind of symbol system that the cosmos is informational rather than physical in nature

53:43.460 --> 53:44.820
That we're in fact

53:44.820 --> 53:50.100
Inside of an information processing system of some kind. So, yeah, you know, you can wonder then

53:50.500 --> 53:53.380
What's the size of the information processing system, you know

53:54.100 --> 54:00.500
Is it are we in something like what's depicted in dark city? Is that what's going on here? You know, how

54:01.140 --> 54:04.740
How uh, what's the scale of the matrix that we're inside of?

54:04.980 --> 54:08.660
Well, the one counter that I can think of giving

54:09.540 --> 54:14.580
To you about that is the idea of the macrocosm and microcosm where

54:15.220 --> 54:17.220
I can imagine there being

54:17.300 --> 54:23.700
Certain processes that are going on that are greater than us and in comparison to which we're like the cells inside of the mind

54:24.100 --> 54:28.500
And I can imagine this going up like some kind of a russian matryoshka doll

54:29.060 --> 54:34.420
Where there could be like certain higher consciousnesses of you know, uh, planets

54:34.500 --> 54:38.020
Or stars or galaxies like it never ends now

54:38.500 --> 54:41.460
I'm not saying that this is something that I'm that attached to

54:41.940 --> 54:48.020
But it is interesting just to see like how certain patterns exist in nature both in the small and in the high end

54:48.180 --> 54:53.140
Like when people observe galaxies, for instance, that makes me think those galaxies can't all be fake, you know

54:53.220 --> 54:57.220
There must be like some bigger process at work here that we're just not aware of

54:58.180 --> 55:00.180
I'll tell you why I disagree with you

55:00.740 --> 55:03.460
I can imagine what you're saying very well

55:04.580 --> 55:06.580
And it's very intriguing

55:06.660 --> 55:10.100
and in some way I would like that to be true because

55:11.220 --> 55:18.100
You know the vast or the cosmos is the more interesting that the evolutionary development possibilities are for all of the

55:18.820 --> 55:23.060
Organisms in it ourselves included. However, the reason why I

55:24.580 --> 55:27.700
First of all, there's no empirical evidence that what you're saying is true

55:28.260 --> 55:33.460
We don't have empirical evidence of that the empirical evidence that we do have of intelligence

55:34.420 --> 55:36.420
That's higher than ours

55:37.140 --> 55:39.140
Suggest that actually

55:39.700 --> 55:41.380
Maybe sadly

55:41.380 --> 55:43.380
We're incredibly important

55:44.180 --> 55:48.980
If you look at the close encounter phenomenon, which I've written an entire book about and which I've mentioned

55:49.060 --> 55:51.300
I've discussed significantly in several other of my books

55:52.180 --> 55:56.180
Including a bit in philosophy of the future. If you look at the close encounter phenomenon

55:58.100 --> 56:01.300
Let's put these Nordics aside for a minute, right these these

56:02.260 --> 56:06.980
People who look like SS officers flying around in their, you know, mercury thorium

56:07.460 --> 56:09.620
Saucers, right muscle down blonde women

56:10.260 --> 56:12.660
Yeah, I mean and they're they're real

56:14.340 --> 56:17.380
There was real as you and I are these are people and you know

56:18.980 --> 56:25.140
They don't I I think they have very deleterious intentions for the near future of our world society

56:25.380 --> 56:27.380
But let's put them aside for the moment

56:28.340 --> 56:31.060
Because I think that actually as I've argued in various books of mine

56:31.140 --> 56:34.340
They're as terrified of this other thing that I'm about to discuss

56:34.900 --> 56:42.500
As some of our government officials are and this other thing this trickster that seems to be able to produce

56:43.380 --> 56:46.260
polymorphous phenomena of all kinds

56:46.980 --> 56:49.940
And that has access to people's bedrooms in the middle of the night

56:50.500 --> 56:52.500
And that sometimes abducts their children

56:53.140 --> 56:55.140
And it takes genetic material from them

56:55.620 --> 57:02.900
And they can shape shift into any number of shamanic forms often drawing from the symbolism of owls and mantids and so forth

57:03.540 --> 57:06.180
Right this entity which I discuss at length

57:06.900 --> 57:10.180
in chapter seven of closer encounters and which I come back to

57:11.140 --> 57:13.700
Contemplating at the end of philosophy of the future

57:15.540 --> 57:19.700
This entity seems awfully interested in human individuals

57:20.500 --> 57:22.500
We are not irrelevant

57:22.580 --> 57:24.820
This thing has tremendous intelligence

57:25.700 --> 57:27.700
It is superior to humanity

57:29.380 --> 57:31.620
It's probably capable of destroying humanity

57:32.500 --> 57:34.500
It certainly has taken apart

57:34.980 --> 57:37.700
human civilizations of global scale before

57:38.340 --> 57:40.500
This is how Atlantis was destroyed ultimately

57:42.900 --> 57:44.740
And

57:44.740 --> 57:48.100
This entity seems incredibly interested in human individuals

57:48.980 --> 57:50.980
We are not at all like

57:51.860 --> 57:58.980
Termites or ants or whatever to this thing every time I hear someone like Michio Kaku say that or any one of these people

57:59.060 --> 58:01.060
Avi Loeb or whatever

58:01.460 --> 58:07.540
It's really aggravating to me because the empirical evidence from close encounters doesn't support that at all

58:08.340 --> 58:14.340
This entity sends emissaries and avatars to interact with us in incredibly intimate ways

58:14.660 --> 58:18.100
And follows human individuals throughout their entire lives gets

58:18.820 --> 58:21.620
Generationally involved with their offspring

58:22.260 --> 58:25.060
It is it is deeply and intimately engaging

58:25.940 --> 58:28.500
The human community and it has an agenda

58:29.380 --> 58:33.540
Which whatever else you want to say about that agenda or speculate about it

58:34.100 --> 58:39.460
Clearly sees the human being as central and of vital importance to its

58:40.260 --> 58:42.100
project for the future

58:42.100 --> 58:45.860
So that's why I I don't really agree with you that

58:46.580 --> 58:52.100
Whatever the forms of intelligence are that are way beyond us and that are operating on a cosmic scale

58:52.500 --> 58:56.340
We actually seem to be incredibly important to them which suggests that we're not actually

58:56.820 --> 58:58.340
All that's separate from them

58:58.340 --> 59:04.980
There's not such a huge gulf between us and them and when you think about the the technological singularity and the transformative potential that it has

59:05.220 --> 59:08.340
That actually makes a lot of sense. We may be very close

59:09.460 --> 59:10.900
to

59:10.900 --> 59:12.420
uh

59:12.420 --> 59:18.980
A transformation and mutation of our form of life that gives us parity with this

59:19.940 --> 59:21.940
entity

59:22.180 --> 59:24.100
I guess the only

59:24.100 --> 59:27.780
Rebutal I would give to that is the idea that this entity

59:28.340 --> 59:29.540
May exist

59:29.540 --> 59:34.740
But there could be also other entities that are beyond that that we don't know and again. I have no proof

59:35.300 --> 59:39.860
For yeah, but there's no evidence for that lab. I mean and look I am as I've said to you before

59:40.420 --> 59:47.540
Uh in our previous conversations and as is abundantly clear from my philosophical work. I'm a radical empiricist

59:48.180 --> 59:57.540
I'm a radical empiricist. I believe in you know, uh developing ontological and epistemological ideas

59:58.100 --> 01:00:00.100
uh that are

01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:06.740
Consonant with phenomena that we can experience and observe and that we can you know

01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:13.060
tangibly make some sense out of and and doing so in ways that afford us opportunities for tangible

01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:16.340
technological development

01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:18.420
And and you know productive artistic

01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:26.180
Endeavors so I'm very much a radical empiricist and why do you say it's uh one

01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:29.620
Entity though as opposed to a multiplicity of entities

01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:31.860
that

01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:33.860
Work in a similar fashion

01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:36.980
It is a multiplicity of entities

01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:41.060
But when you really, you know, the devil is in the details

01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:43.460
quite literally

01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:46.500
And when you look at the details of some of these close encounters

01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:53.700
You have to come away with the conclusion that there is some kind of

01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:57.620
Uh, how can I put it?

01:00:57.620 --> 01:01:01.460
I don't want to use the term high of mind because it's it's not

01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:05.220
Something like the borg that we're dealing with. It is not a

01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:07.940
collective intelligence

01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:10.020
or a kind of um

01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:12.180
Uh organic

01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:17.700
Unity that subsumes the individual the way that the borg

01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:23.620
Uh assimilates and extinguishes the individuality of the people who are

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:28.260
Assimilated by the collective. That's not what we're dealing with. In fact

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:31.380
This

01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:36.660
Super organism appears to want to encourage individuation and differentiation

01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:39.860
For the sake of maximizing creative potential

01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:45.780
So I don't want to call it a hive mind. Okay, but it appears that these entities

01:01:47.380 --> 01:01:53.380
Are operating in tandem in a way that suggests the functioning of some higher

01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:55.620
Organizing intelligence

01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:57.220
albeit

01:01:57.220 --> 01:01:59.220
Very finite

01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:03.380
Intelligence is certainly not anything like an omniscient or omnipotent god

01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:06.580
Well in the buddhism

01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:12.260
The value that you're giving towards human beings is in a way echoed when they talk about human beings

01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:15.780
A rebirth within that realm is the best of all

01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:22.260
Obviously you disagree with the direction the buddhas end up going to but their reasoning is when you're in the realm of the

01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:24.900
Higher end gods or the jealous gods

01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:29.940
You're always going to be a lot more raptured in having all this power to deal with

01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:33.940
Same thing when you're in the realm of the hell beings or the hungry ghosts

01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:38.260
So I don't know if that is a concept that is close to you as well

01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:43.540
Like that reason for human beings being so special even if you go in a different direction with it

01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:48.260
Actually, yes, I would say so and you know someday we should do an entire show just on

01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:50.980
what I think of buddhism because

01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:53.860
I've said before, you know the

01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:56.100
On an ontological and epistemological level

01:02:56.100 --> 01:03:03.220
there's actually a lot of overlap between my work and the thought of gotama and nagarjuna and some of the serious, you know

01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:08.420
thinkers in the history of the buddhidharma from the beginning and

01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:11.220
you're right that

01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:16.180
In a certain way what i'm saying about this entity's interest in humanity is

01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:18.980
consonant with

01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:20.980
Gotama's valuation

01:03:21.620 --> 01:03:26.100
Of the human community over that of both the devas and the ashuras

01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:29.460
You know gotama recognized rightly

01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:32.180
That I mean, you know just recognized right?

01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:38.020
He was he was a reincarnation of someone who had lived in deva realms previously

01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:46.260
And he was familiar with the ashura realms the realms of what we call in in a west western tradition the olympians and the titans

01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:48.820
and

01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:52.500
He knew based on personal memory and amnesis

01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:55.620
that

01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:06.660
There is more possibility for personal development and the achievement of insight in the human realm than there is in these other

01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:09.540
worlds

01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:14.260
Uh, and I think this entity feels the same way, but the difference is

01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:17.220
that gotama thought that

01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:22.100
total enlightenment ultimately meant the extinguishing of individuality

01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:27.220
and he has a nihilistic view of suffering as

01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:29.780
having no

01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:31.300
ultimate

01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:34.580
purpose that you know suffering is futile

01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:38.420
And that what we should aim at is the extinguishing of suffering

01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:41.620
Whereas this entity I think very much

01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:44.180
Or rather I should say

01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:49.780
Nietzsche very much shares the the outlook of this entity, which is that suffering is

01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:53.780
Absolutely indispensable to any creative endeavor

01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:56.500
Uh, and that the great creators

01:04:57.620 --> 01:04:58.820
need

01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:01.380
suffering as part of you know the

01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:08.260
Generative process that they act as conduits for in this world

01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:12.180
Right, and you can see that very much for example at the core of the myth of prometheus

01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:19.860
There's tremendous tragic suffering in the myth of prometheus, which Nietzsche discusses in the birth of tragedy specifically right prometheus as this

01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:25.380
Tragic image of human aspiration and as the first uh mask

01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:27.940
um in greek theater, so

01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:30.100
so

01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:32.660
The tragic life affirming view

01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:36.100
Of Nietzsche

01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:39.380
Is much more in line with how this entity

01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:41.620
sees

01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:43.300
human evolution

01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:45.860
Than gotama's nihilistic will

01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:49.620
To end suffering by extinguishing individuality

01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:56.900
Before we proceed onwards. There is also the uh roodolph steiner view, which I see as being related

01:05:57.220 --> 01:06:01.940
When he talked about how when you would observe a plant or a tree

01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:08.500
Or anything in your vicinity in the way you're giving life to it and that reminds me of what you're talking about this

01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:14.180
Generating informational computational system that we're in where our

01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:20.660
Looking out at something in a way does give more life to it than it may have originally had

01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:29.460
Because we're imbuing whatever we're looking at maybe including another person or including whatever we would consider to be a god of sorts

01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:34.580
We're imbuing that with the power it did not originally have before we uh looked at it

01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:37.140
Or before we thought about it

01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:42.180
Yeah, the yeah look steiner has any number of very interesting insights here and there

01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:48.100
And and he was a very innovative thinker in some ways and particularly when it comes to like applied fields

01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:53.780
He was a polymath, you know who developed innovative educational techniques and

01:06:54.420 --> 01:06:58.420
I don't know botany and agricultural methods and all kinds of interesting things

01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:03.060
But the uh essential problem with steiner is that he's a strange sort of gnostic

01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:06.260
Who has a basically dualistic ontology?

01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:11.380
And this is something that i'm trying to deconstruct in my work with my concept of the spectral revolution

01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:18.500
This idea that you know, they're for steiner. There's this transcendental realm, which you know is uh

01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:22.900
Sort of presided over by lucifer and then there's this purely

01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:29.220
materialistic realm which is controlled by ahriman and that the human experience is kind of a

01:07:29.940 --> 01:07:32.660
Middle ground between these polarities, right?

01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:36.980
I deconstruct that kind of dualism just as niche does

01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:42.100
And uh, I think there's only one world. There's the world of our phenomenal experience

01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:48.420
And you know what we frame as the spiritual versus the physical is a question again of

01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:56.740
Linguistic structures the conditioned consciousness and that's set in place filters for our perception and our processing of our experience

01:07:56.980 --> 01:08:02.180
Our experience of a singular world of experience. I mean our experience of a singular world

01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:07.380
Which you know, the greeks called fuses going back to our quite as nature as it were

01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:10.740
But within that world we would also have let's say

01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:14.820
Certain places that people would only be able to observe

01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:21.380
During the in-between state of uh, you know the afterlife. I guess you could say so

01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:27.220
Similarly, we could have like with the japanese buddhas. They have this conception of pure land buddhism

01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:32.260
Which is like this whole other realm that you can go into and like that'll meditate all day or whatever

01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:36.580
So i'm not sure exactly as far as the amount of

01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:42.580
Real estate that we have to work with here including like going back in time that you were talking about as well

01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:44.740
You know, how

01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:50.180
How much is there to explore how much is there to uncover or is it pretty much like

01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:54.660
The earth and however we keep going, you know expanding beyond that

01:08:55.300 --> 01:08:57.380
Look, I think there's a lot of real estate again, though

01:08:57.380 --> 01:09:01.140
Let me emphasize the fact that it's it's a question of filters

01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:04.020
You know when people die

01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:08.660
Filters are removed

01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:18.020
Filters that are integral to this particular form this construction that we take to be the physical human body

01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:23.700
Filters are removed and other dimensions of experience become perceivable

01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:29.620
It's not that there's another world. We don't go into the other side after we die. Okay, this is these are

01:09:30.820 --> 01:09:38.740
Dangerous delusions that are being propagated today as part of a discourse that I think ultimately is going to be used to implement

01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:46.260
traditionalism and kind of neo feudal subjugation of humanity under a sort of kingdom of heaven

01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:48.980
and you know

01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:51.460
I think that it's important to acknowledge first of all

01:09:51.940 --> 01:09:59.460
That there's a singular realm of experience and that our capacity to perceive various dimensions of it is a question of what filters are operating

01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:03.860
Now drugs can remove certain of those filters like for example DMT

01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:08.500
Giving us access to these realms where there are apparently these machine elves

01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:12.740
But in the same DMT spaces, there are also these reptilians who rape women

01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:16.580
Okay, so my issue with what you said about the pure land

01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:21.940
Hmm is that so far as I've heard in the contemporary

01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:26.340
uh realm of research on altered states of consciousness

01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:31.780
Nobody has come back and given us a report about the buddhist pure land as far as I'm aware

01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:36.900
Now, of course, there are buddhist writings where these monks claim, you know to have connected with that realm

01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:41.380
But you know, there's a lot to psychological projection. I mean you can you can really like really

01:10:42.340 --> 01:10:44.340
Imagine yourself in a different milieu

01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:51.060
With vivid clarity basically put yourself into a lucid dream while you're meditating. That's one thing

01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:53.380
But in terms of uh, you know

01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:59.700
Phenomenological realms of experience that could be shared by other people the way that I think the DMT space can be

01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:07.700
I don't see anything like the pure land. I don't see any and I'm making this point very deliberately because uh,

01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:15.140
I wanted to be impressed upon the listener that there's nowhere to escape to that doesn't involve conflict and suffering

01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:18.340
The DMT realm involves terrifying shit

01:11:19.220 --> 01:11:24.580
Any, you know, honest authentic account of that makes it very clear that it is not a safe place to be

01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:27.300
Okay, so

01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:31.700
Uh, I think that again, you know, this whole notion

01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:37.220
That we should seek an enlightenment that involves

01:11:38.020 --> 01:11:40.580
ultimate peace tranquility and harmony

01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:46.660
And eventually also the effacing of our ego and the annihilation of our individuality

01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:49.380
Is completely misguided

01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:52.980
And it's the most sophisticated form of nihilism

01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:59.300
Nietzsche saw this by the way. He said look at least I respect buddhism because its form of nihilism is more sophisticated

01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:04.740
Than that of christianity, right? If you're going to be a nihilist be a buddhist not a christian, right? So

01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:10.100
Uh, my work very much flies in the face of that kind of nihilism

01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:13.060
Well, uh, speaking of effacing the ego

01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:17.540
I think now would be a good time to get to the kind of effacing that's going on right now

01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:23.460
with the uh, palestine protests going on in the new york city and uh, all over

01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:30.900
And the general trend that I mean we talked about this before the convergence in a way that i'm seeing of the ultra left

01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:37.060
and uh, certain elements of the uh, further right when it comes to wanting to embrace this kind of

01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:44.660
Traditionalism, but this kind of like almost like third worldist type of traditionalism where a lot of those protesters

01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:51.060
You know, they have no problem with china. They have no problem with uh, you know, whatever's going on in africa in the middle east

01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:56.180
They have a big problem with these, uh, you know, 18th 17th century

01:12:56.660 --> 01:13:02.820
Statues and monuments, you know to uh, western civilization. That's what they want to get rid of

01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:07.380
So where exactly do you see this going right now?

01:13:07.860 --> 01:13:10.020
Uh, jason, you've uh, well got the floor. Yeah

01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:14.820
Look, there's so much that I want to say about this

01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:21.780
I kind of don't even know where to begin and uh, you know, you know, because we were trying to organize a show some time ago weeks ago

01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:23.700
um

01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:26.660
That I really didn't want to talk about this subject public

01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:29.300
I really tried not to say anything about this publicly

01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:34.260
Because we're involved in some very positive optimistic work with the colossus project

01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:36.820
and you know, I want to uh

01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:43.460
I want to do as much as I can to make sure that that moves forward

01:13:44.580 --> 01:13:48.180
Expeditiously and triumphantly that having been said

01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:54.580
It's just gone too far. It's gone way too far

01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:59.780
So you mentioned pulling down of statues, right back in the summer of of george floyd

01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:02.740
The summer of george floyd summer of love

01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:08.180
Yes in 2020, right. I love how these fuckers who were, you know, uh

01:14:09.620 --> 01:14:17.460
Desecrating our war memorials and want to pull down the statues of our founders also do instagram posts where you know, it's all about love

01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:20.420
It's all about love man. That's all it matters and the world is love

01:14:20.660 --> 01:14:26.500
And then they go and they burn the american flag or they raise the palestinian flag higher than the american flag on flag polls

01:14:26.820 --> 01:14:33.860
Right, and then they go and they desecrate, you know war memorials to uh, you know, uh, world war one heroes in this country

01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:37.140
And burn american flags of the but no, it's all about love

01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:42.660
right, uh, anyway, um, what I was going to say was that back in the summer of george floyd

01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:48.020
We saw them starting to pull down all these statues. So the founders of our country including

01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:55.140
This great sculpture of theodore roosevelt that was on the steps of the museum of natural history in new york

01:14:55.380 --> 01:14:57.380
There's a place that was dear to my heart from childhood

01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:01.300
And um

01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:08.740
They didn't even care whether the the founders were slave owners or not they pulled down statues of abraham lincoln

01:15:09.620 --> 01:15:12.180
Back in the summer of george. So that summer

01:15:12.660 --> 01:15:17.140
With you know, what happened in minneapolis? What happened in portland the whole chas

01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:19.700
encampment and so on and so forth, right

01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:22.660
That was a watershed moment

01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:25.380
And I founded prometheism

01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:30.100
In response to that if you look at when prometheism was founded july 4th

01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:33.620
2020 what was the context that was the context?

01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:41.300
Okay, so that was a watershed moment. We're at another turning point now. Okay. We are at another

01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:43.300
uh

01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:46.260
Rubicon crossing of the rubicon moment right now

01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:50.900
Where

01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:54.500
Let me take this angle

01:15:54.820 --> 01:15:56.820
where

01:15:56.820 --> 01:15:58.580
slogans

01:15:58.580 --> 01:16:00.580
That were devised

01:16:01.380 --> 01:16:04.100
By ayatollah homini in iran

01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:06.500
during

01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:10.180
The hostage crisis while american hostages were being held in terron

01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:14.420
Ayatollah homini and his fellow molas

01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:18.420
Came up with these slogans like death to america

01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:24.260
Which are now being chanted on the campuses and the streets of american cities

01:16:24.740 --> 01:16:31.780
And in some cases we literally see agents of the islamic republic coming and setting up seminars to teach americans

01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:37.860
How to chant not just death to america in english, but marg bar america in persia literally

01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:40.340
Teaching them how to pronounce this enchantment

01:16:41.940 --> 01:16:43.940
And these same people

01:16:44.580 --> 01:16:46.580
Are burning american flags

01:16:47.940 --> 01:16:50.260
And they're passing out leaflets saying

01:16:51.620 --> 01:16:55.380
The freedom of palestine means death to america

01:16:56.660 --> 01:16:58.340
Right

01:16:58.340 --> 01:17:01.620
Self-described anarchists self-described communists

01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:06.820
Who are supporting an organization namely hamas

01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:10.260
Who they characterize as freedom fighters?

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:18.580
But who are actually radical fundamentalist adherents of a religion that endorses slavery

01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:23.220
That endorses the enslavement of women

01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:28.180
And their total degradation as second or third class citizens

01:17:29.220 --> 01:17:32.900
And the religion that violently conquered and genocided

01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:40.820
Other cultures in the world and deprived them of any freedom of religion or freedom of conscience or freedom of expression

01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:45.460
Self-described communists and anarchists who

01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:53.940
Whether or not we agree with their ideology at least were supposedly advocates for freedom and liberation

01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:59.300
Right and we're supposedly struggling against capitalism because it was too oppressive

01:18:00.340 --> 01:18:07.700
Right and that it was uh too much of a constraint on the human individual and that it didn't go far enough

01:18:07.780 --> 01:18:13.780
Let's say in liberating women these same communists and anarchists are now supporting the most regressive

01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:16.500
traditionalist ideology on the planet

01:18:16.740 --> 01:18:18.900
Which is being spearheaded by hamas

01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:22.900
What the fuck is going on here?

01:18:24.420 --> 01:18:29.940
Right and meanwhile you have in europe for example, we saw what a week ago. I think it was in germany

01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:35.860
Mass protests. I mean math tens of thousands. Where did these people come from?

01:18:36.820 --> 01:18:38.820
Who let these people into europe?

01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:44.580
Oh anglo-merkel, right? I remember now, right 2013 2014

01:18:46.020 --> 01:18:51.860
Yeah, well the the chickens come home to roost at this point tens of thousands of people are marching in germany

01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:55.140
demanding an islamic caliphate replace the german government

01:18:56.020 --> 01:19:00.900
So that's going on in europe where we literally have muslim armies on the street

01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:03.540
demand and then in britain

01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:05.540
islamic parties

01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:07.940
allied with leftists are winning elections

01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:10.580
left and right

01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:12.740
And they're using their political power

01:19:13.300 --> 01:19:19.300
To completely strip the british citizen of all their fundamental freedoms like we saw happen in scotland in particular

01:19:19.540 --> 01:19:25.860
And ireland's having kind of identity crisis where on the one hand ireland traditionally, you know with the ira and such

01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:31.460
We're supporting palestine, but now they're also having this influx of these migrants that are coming in

01:19:31.780 --> 01:19:33.860
They want to it's straight out of lord of the rings

01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:38.500
They want to tear down this beautiful ancient tree in order to build a migrant center

01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:41.540
And now there's this war that's going on between the

01:19:42.260 --> 01:19:44.900
irish people who live there and the people that want to tear it down

01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:48.420
So i don't know what's going on specifically with those people

01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:51.860
I mean thankfully a lot of the irish people are standing up for themselves right now

01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:57.620
But yeah, they're also supporting palestine. They're also supporting palestine. What kind of sense does that make, you know?

01:19:57.940 --> 01:20:00.820
That's very strange order irish. It's a disgrace

01:20:02.020 --> 01:20:04.020
I think it's utterly disgraceful

01:20:04.660 --> 01:20:06.660
you know like

01:20:06.980 --> 01:20:08.980
For fuck's sake, okay israel

01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:12.020
was a secular

01:20:12.260 --> 01:20:13.940
Progressive country

01:20:13.940 --> 01:20:15.940
Which has demonstrated

01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:24.660
tremendous capacity in contribution to technological science, which has fostered the arts a society where

01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:28.020
women are

01:20:28.020 --> 01:20:32.580
Respected to the point where the defense of the nation is also entrusted to them

01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:40.980
A society that from the earliest days when the kibbutz movement formed the substrate of israeli society

01:20:41.380 --> 01:20:44.260
Was based on radical egalitarianism

01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:46.740
okay

01:20:46.740 --> 01:20:51.700
And a society that has always enshrined and protected freedom of speech freedom of the press

01:20:52.260 --> 01:20:59.780
Right and and yeah, and all the what we consider to be sacred and fundamental rights of the human individual on the one hand

01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:04.420
You have that society by the way a society that includes many israeli arabs

01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:07.700
Christians drues

01:21:07.700 --> 01:21:09.140
drues

01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:10.980
at eight at the left

01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:12.980
Samaritans first society

01:21:13.540 --> 01:21:19.140
Okay, uh one devoted to the protection of the individual one devoted to uh, you know

01:21:19.780 --> 01:21:21.780
The equality of women

01:21:22.100 --> 01:21:24.100
and one that has

01:21:24.660 --> 01:21:26.660
contributed

01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:29.700
With tremendous disproportionate power

01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:32.900
To the advancement of science and technology

01:21:33.380 --> 01:21:36.660
Okay, um, but the problem is that they're like the adult in the room

01:21:36.660 --> 01:21:42.420
They're like the logical adult and the kids are like, you know, fuck you dad. I don't have to listen to you

01:21:42.820 --> 01:21:46.020
It seems like it's that kind of relationship that's going on where people

01:21:46.580 --> 01:21:52.020
Protesters against netanyahu the protesters against him, but in general just the anti-israel feeling

01:21:52.260 --> 01:21:54.260
I think a lot of it comes from

01:21:54.420 --> 01:22:00.900
Maybe israel is not dianesean enough to put it a certain way because people who are looking at israel are just seeing

01:22:00.980 --> 01:22:02.420
You know these very

01:22:02.420 --> 01:22:05.300
Logical people who are trying to explain themselves

01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:09.940
Meanwhile people want to burn things down and cause all this chaos

01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:12.500
I don't know if you've thought about it in that direction

01:22:12.580 --> 01:22:16.100
But at least from people who I've spoken with they kind of see israel

01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:19.860
I know this is very beneath you, but they see israel as cringe

01:22:20.180 --> 01:22:25.860
You know that they don't see that kind of fire in israel's belly that would be a commanding force

01:22:26.260 --> 01:22:31.940
And maybe that's why we have all these people online who are also going against israel just from an optics perspective

01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:36.020
Well, maybe you're right israel might not be dianesean enough

01:22:37.220 --> 01:22:41.140
Dianesis is an incredibly violent symbol. So maybe israel should be a lot more violent

01:22:41.380 --> 01:22:46.420
I would be absolutely in favor of that. I think this should be a lot more commanding. There might be something to what you're saying

01:22:46.660 --> 01:22:48.980
no, there really might be something to what you're saying, but

01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:56.180
Who is holding israel back? Well, now we know who's holding israel back because guess what it just came out

01:22:56.900 --> 01:22:58.900
that the united states

01:22:59.380 --> 01:23:01.380
The administration of joe biden

01:23:02.260 --> 01:23:07.700
Sent the representative to negotiate with the islamic republic of iran in oman

01:23:08.660 --> 01:23:09.620
Oh, man

01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:17.220
Okay, and the deputy foreign minister of iran was the one present at those negotiations and guess what the subject of discussion was

01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:19.860
Bringing an end to the war in gaza

01:23:20.340 --> 01:23:22.500
By changing the government in israel

01:23:23.220 --> 01:23:26.020
So here's israel since october 7th

01:23:26.820 --> 01:23:32.580
rightly aiming for regime change in iran, which would be a tremendous favor to the iranian people

01:23:32.820 --> 01:23:41.540
And meanwhile the united states instead of helping israel to foment regime change in iran or at least not standing in the way of israel

01:23:42.020 --> 01:23:47.860
The united states is secretly plotting with a regime whose slogan and maxim is death to america

01:23:48.420 --> 01:23:51.380
In order to do what to change the government of israel

01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:57.220
Before we get deeper into this. I just want to say that about a year ago

01:23:57.700 --> 01:24:03.540
I was at a party in the in the hamptons, you know the far far east there of long island

01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:09.220
And I met a guy who was introduced to me by a friend as being part of masad

01:24:10.100 --> 01:24:16.900
Okay, and I told this guy the what you recommended, which is that israel should go into um

01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:22.180
Rather than gaza, you know should go into iran should decimate, uh, you know the government buildings

01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:25.140
But leave the nukes alone and the masad guy said

01:24:25.780 --> 01:24:30.420
Lev you're absolutely right. We should do this, but we can't because america won't let us

01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:39.060
In order to corroborate that let me also tell you what someone very well positioned with a lot of connections to the israeli government told me

01:24:39.460 --> 01:24:43.940
Which is that after october 7th like, you know on october 8th. Yeah

01:24:44.740 --> 01:24:47.780
You remember how long it took israel to go into gaza, right? Yeah

01:24:48.420 --> 01:24:52.100
It was long we were wait for weeks. We were wait. What what is this operation going to take place?

01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:57.460
You know why because actually netanyahu didn't want to go into gaza because netanyahu knew

01:24:58.180 --> 01:25:02.580
What the optics of this were going to be like netanyahu wanted to bomb iran

01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:07.300
He wanted to bomb the islamic republic out of existence rightfully so because

01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:16.740
Who's controlling the tentacles of this octopus? That's hamas and that's hezbollah and the houthis of yemen and you know the the various uh

01:25:17.700 --> 01:25:25.460
Militias in iraq that are against israel obviously the regime in tehran so israel wanted to go after iran

01:25:26.660 --> 01:25:30.740
The united states sent those two aircraft carriers into the Mediterranean

01:25:31.380 --> 01:25:36.020
Not to support israel, but to intimidate and threaten israel

01:25:36.660 --> 01:25:40.260
I know this for a fact what they told the israelis was here

01:25:40.900 --> 01:25:44.340
Here are these two aircraft carriers to help defend you

01:25:45.300 --> 01:25:48.900
But if you attack iran, we will publicly withdraw these carriers

01:25:49.300 --> 01:25:52.100
Sending a signal to the iranians that we don't have your back anymore

01:25:52.900 --> 01:25:54.900
okay, so

01:25:54.980 --> 01:25:56.980
This is horrendous

01:25:57.540 --> 01:26:02.340
especially when you have masses of leftists on the streets in america

01:26:03.780 --> 01:26:06.740
And having taken over tens of our campuses

01:26:07.700 --> 01:26:09.700
chanting slogans

01:26:09.700 --> 01:26:11.700
That were designed in tehran

01:26:12.660 --> 01:26:19.700
When you have masses of people on the streets of america chanting death to america while burning american flags and desecrating american

01:26:20.340 --> 01:26:22.900
war memorials and at the same time

01:26:23.460 --> 01:26:24.740
you're

01:26:24.740 --> 01:26:26.740
doing back room deals

01:26:27.620 --> 01:26:29.620
with the islamic republic of iran

01:26:31.380 --> 01:26:34.340
There is no higher form of treason than that

01:26:35.460 --> 01:26:38.020
That these protests were allowed to continue

01:26:38.820 --> 01:26:42.500
For what is it now two months for two months?

01:26:42.580 --> 01:26:47.700
We saw these campuses be taken out including by the way the campus of colombia university

01:26:49.140 --> 01:26:54.020
Was a sacred place to me. There is a monument to athena there

01:26:55.860 --> 01:27:00.580
That to me has always made that place the campus of athena campus in the roman sense

01:27:00.580 --> 01:27:07.140
You know the word campus actually comes from the roman term for sacred precincts like the campus of mars

01:27:07.780 --> 01:27:09.780
In rome in ancient rome

01:27:09.780 --> 01:27:12.500
And to me that place was always the campus of athena. I used to go there

01:27:13.060 --> 01:27:20.900
You know in the wee hours of the morning before people showed up and just walk the colonnade there and silently contemplate and

01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:23.540
Pay my respects to athena

01:27:24.820 --> 01:27:27.460
They desecrated that place they literally held

01:27:28.180 --> 01:27:30.980
ceremonies converting american students to islam

01:27:31.780 --> 01:27:36.980
Under the banner of the pro-palestine movement on the campus of colombia university in the shadow of athena

01:27:37.220 --> 01:27:40.100
They literally put a banner around athena

01:27:42.100 --> 01:27:44.900
Renaming that place the people's university of palestine

01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:51.220
They excluded jews from the campus at colombia at yale at any number of other universities

01:27:52.260 --> 01:27:54.260
They formed human chains

01:27:54.660 --> 01:28:02.340
Backed by the security forces on the campus to prevent jewish students and jewish professors from entering the campus

01:28:03.300 --> 01:28:05.300
But there are from what i understand also

01:28:05.540 --> 01:28:10.500
Leftist jews who are a part of the protest as has always been in history

01:28:10.580 --> 01:28:17.940
Like people always love referring to like barbara learner specter or any of these idiots that are talking about you know wanting to destroy

01:28:18.420 --> 01:28:21.540
Europe and my whole point is that you're going to have jews

01:28:21.860 --> 01:28:24.740
Who are going to have bad ideas as well as good ideas?

01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:28.980
And those are going to be the jews that people end up paying attention to and unfortunately right now

01:28:28.980 --> 01:28:33.140
I'm sure that there are some jewish students who are so self-hating

01:28:33.460 --> 01:28:39.140
And who have this romance having to do with you know freeing palestine and all that that they're also going to join the cause

01:28:40.180 --> 01:28:44.740
Well, if I were in mosad right now, I would find a way to start eliminating these people

01:28:44.980 --> 01:28:52.260
I mean they represent an existential threat to israel. Well, I've always said I've always said this that israel will never

01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:54.980
Be defeated by any foreign enemy

01:28:55.780 --> 01:29:00.500
If israel is ever defeated one day, it will be defeated by traders from within

01:29:01.380 --> 01:29:06.580
People within israel will defeat israel israel can never be defeated by any foreign enemy

01:29:06.820 --> 01:29:10.180
That country has 300 nuclear warheads

01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:18.020
And by the way that arsenal stands between islam and its ambition for the conquest of the west

01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:23.140
Never forget that never forget those 300 israeli nukes will be used

01:29:23.700 --> 01:29:30.100
Before europe is conquered by islam. Okay, so look, but my point is this

01:29:30.900 --> 01:29:34.100
that when you have on the one hand these kinds of

01:29:35.780 --> 01:29:38.260
rabidly anti-american protests taking place

01:29:38.900 --> 01:29:41.540
On these campuses and in the streets of american cities

01:29:42.180 --> 01:29:47.860
Desecrating war memorials and so forth burning the american flag raising the flag of palestine higher than the american flag

01:29:48.420 --> 01:29:49.940
all the while

01:29:49.940 --> 01:29:51.940
chanting death to america

01:29:52.100 --> 01:29:54.100
and at the same time

01:29:54.260 --> 01:30:01.140
us government officials are doing back room deals with the islamic republic to undercut israel

01:30:02.820 --> 01:30:08.820
I don't know what worse form of treason we could see in our country than that

01:30:09.700 --> 01:30:16.100
Okay, and so the to me the ultimate red line has already been crossed and as an iranian american

01:30:16.580 --> 01:30:18.980
Look, I was born here. Okay, but

01:30:20.740 --> 01:30:28.660
I know a lot of other iranian americans foremost my fiance who spent 13 years living in the fucking islamic republic

01:30:29.220 --> 01:30:30.740
I can tell you

01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:34.180
What it's like for iranian americans who fled that regime

01:30:35.060 --> 01:30:36.660
to come here

01:30:36.660 --> 01:30:39.540
Looking for a place where individual liberty is honored

01:30:39.780 --> 01:30:45.220
And to hear the same slogan that they had to live with in iran

01:30:45.700 --> 01:30:51.700
Mark that on recall death to america being chanted by american youth here on the streets of our cities

01:30:52.660 --> 01:30:54.660
the iranian youth today

01:30:55.460 --> 01:30:58.580
70 percent of iran is under the age of 30 iran

01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:05.140
May have many problems, but the natalist problem is not one of them. It's a very youthful vigorous population

01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:12.260
70 percent of the country's under the age of 30 and the iranian youth are undoubtedly the most pro-american population

01:31:12.660 --> 01:31:16.740
On the planet. Okay out of time when anti-americanism is on the rise

01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:23.780
It's undoubtedly the case that the most solid future ally of america

01:31:25.460 --> 01:31:28.180
Is the iranian nation? Okay

01:31:28.420 --> 01:31:35.060
But what is a travesty is that the average iranian youth today the average

01:31:35.700 --> 01:31:37.700
Iranian in their 20s or 30s today

01:31:38.660 --> 01:31:43.940
Cares more about american culture and has a better appreciation of america's history

01:31:44.660 --> 01:31:46.660
than american youth do

01:31:47.300 --> 01:31:51.300
And i'm i'm warning you people right i'm just giving issuing a general warning

01:31:52.180 --> 01:31:57.620
This is not going to go to a good place. This is not going to go to a good place. Iran is a country

01:31:58.660 --> 01:32:03.860
That has been conquered by greeks, romans, arabs

01:32:04.980 --> 01:32:06.820
turks

01:32:06.820 --> 01:32:08.820
and mongols

01:32:09.460 --> 01:32:10.980
It suffered

01:32:10.980 --> 01:32:12.980
genocidal conquests

01:32:13.060 --> 01:32:15.060
at the hands of foreign enemies

01:32:15.540 --> 01:32:17.540
and it came back

01:32:17.540 --> 01:32:19.540
five times

01:32:19.540 --> 01:32:21.860
Not just as a country as an empire

01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:24.020
five times

01:32:24.020 --> 01:32:26.020
Okay, iran will rise again

01:32:28.180 --> 01:32:30.180
The people of america

01:32:30.180 --> 01:32:36.340
I don't i don't even want to use the term united states anymore because this fucking regime that calls itself the united states government

01:32:36.740 --> 01:32:39.300
Is a treasonous criminal mafia

01:32:40.260 --> 01:32:42.260
To which no one should pay taxes by the way

01:32:42.900 --> 01:32:45.140
It is a treasonous criminal mafia

01:32:45.700 --> 01:32:50.900
That does not represent the interests of americans, but the people of america should be very careful

01:32:51.940 --> 01:32:54.340
To get this situation under control soon

01:32:54.900 --> 01:32:56.420
and to

01:32:57.380 --> 01:33:00.260
Eliminate these vermin

01:33:01.140 --> 01:33:07.860
Who have stripped themselves of their american citizenship by conducting themselves in this manner that we've seen over the past two months

01:33:08.340 --> 01:33:10.340
otherwise

01:33:10.820 --> 01:33:12.820
If iran rises again

01:33:13.540 --> 01:33:19.700
And we have a population in iran that respects american culture and american history more than

01:33:20.820 --> 01:33:22.820
american youth do

01:33:23.460 --> 01:33:27.140
Something very bad is going to happen that i hope i never had lived to see

01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:30.020
Okay, i'm telling you right now well if we can uh

01:33:31.060 --> 01:33:33.220
Europe is fucked europe is fucked

01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:37.460
All right, uh look at germany look at britain france

01:33:37.460 --> 01:33:40.580
I have some hope for but let me be very frank with you

01:33:41.140 --> 01:33:49.540
That right the latest figures that i've seen show 25 of the urban population of france is is living under sharia

01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:55.380
There are sharia no-go zones in stance where uh french

01:33:56.180 --> 01:33:58.420
The french justice system no longer applies

01:33:58.980 --> 01:34:02.900
And and france has the highest birth rate by the way as well in europe of muslims

01:34:02.980 --> 01:34:06.100
Yeah, well, yeah, that's of the children of migrants

01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:13.700
Okay, and so look the figures in france are are extremely grim. It looks like about 25 of france

01:34:14.900 --> 01:34:15.780
is

01:34:15.780 --> 01:34:17.060
gone

01:34:17.060 --> 01:34:22.100
Okay has been subsumed by basically the the fifth column of the caliphate

01:34:22.740 --> 01:34:25.540
Uh, but i actually think there's some hope for france

01:34:26.020 --> 01:34:31.540
I think that if national front comes back in 2027 there is some hope for france. However

01:34:32.420 --> 01:34:34.020
Let me be clear

01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:36.820
There will be no solution in france without concentration camps

01:34:37.460 --> 01:34:40.100
Absolutely no solution in france without concentration camps

01:34:40.740 --> 01:34:45.540
They are going to have to take french citizens so-called french citizens

01:34:46.260 --> 01:34:52.100
Who at this point are citizens of a nascent global caliphate and they're going to have to concentrate them in certain places

01:34:53.300 --> 01:34:56.980
And extricate them from france. Maybe they should take algeria

01:34:57.460 --> 01:35:00.660
Back and they should use it for this purpose in any case

01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:07.140
Because france is constituted differently from britain and i mean that constituted in both senses of the word

01:35:07.460 --> 01:35:11.380
I actually think there's some hope in france, but it's going to be extremely brutal

01:35:11.780 --> 01:35:13.780
You know to constitute

01:35:14.340 --> 01:35:20.420
What what may end up being the sixth french republic? It's doable though and here in this country

01:35:21.860 --> 01:35:23.860
The situation is also not far gone

01:35:24.420 --> 01:35:26.420
There's still hope to turn things around

01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:32.180
But it has to be done very soon and if it doesn't happen during a second term of trump

01:35:33.220 --> 01:35:38.420
We're going to be utterly hopeless and a catastrophe will unfold which you know

01:35:39.700 --> 01:35:43.380
You know, yes, he's going to come out of the bottle the camp you put back in

01:35:43.780 --> 01:35:46.420
Now if we break down some of the players involved here

01:35:47.220 --> 01:35:53.620
One of the organizations that's currently funding these uh protests is the open society foundation

01:35:53.940 --> 01:35:59.620
You know george saris but more now his son alex who is dating huma abedin

01:35:59.940 --> 01:36:05.220
Whose parents from what i understand are involved or we're involved with the muslim brotherhood

01:36:05.620 --> 01:36:12.180
So what exactly is going on here and one more thing to add to that from what i understand during obama's administration

01:36:12.180 --> 01:36:18.820
When hillary clinton was secretary of state they redid all the manuals having to do with counter terrorism

01:36:19.140 --> 01:36:22.340
To completely scrub it of anything related to islam

01:36:22.980 --> 01:36:24.980
So i'm curious what you make of this

01:36:25.940 --> 01:36:32.100
Look another reason i'm so visibly irate is because i spent a decade in the iranian opposition

01:36:32.740 --> 01:36:34.740
And three years in its leadership

01:36:35.380 --> 01:36:37.940
We found that the democrat party in the united states

01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:45.300
Wanted to secure the continued existence of the islamic republic of iran pretty much at any cost and they undermine any and every effort

01:36:45.940 --> 01:36:48.660
Uh of the iranian people to change this regime

01:36:49.380 --> 01:36:52.980
So this is an issue in particular with the democrats in this country

01:36:53.700 --> 01:37:00.100
And we can see that reflected just uh, you know in the last 48 hours with this letter that blinkin

01:37:00.580 --> 01:37:02.580
ordered his people to issue

01:37:03.060 --> 01:37:09.140
Expressing condolences for the death of reisi president reisi was a butcher president reisi

01:37:10.420 --> 01:37:13.540
presided as a summary execution jurist

01:37:14.420 --> 01:37:20.500
over the mass execution of thousands of political dissidents in iran

01:37:21.060 --> 01:37:22.900
and you and people

01:37:22.900 --> 01:37:26.900
Before it was even confirmed that his helicopter, you know

01:37:27.860 --> 01:37:31.300
Cashed and that he had you know that he had met his demise

01:37:31.540 --> 01:37:36.500
You had fireworks going off all across iranian cities that night. The iranian people were celebrating

01:37:36.980 --> 01:37:38.980
Throughout the night and into the next morning

01:37:39.700 --> 01:37:41.300
for the death of this

01:37:41.300 --> 01:37:47.860
Butcher and meanwhile the u.s. State department issues its condolences for the death of reisi

01:37:48.420 --> 01:37:50.580
Right and the u.s. State department

01:37:51.540 --> 01:37:54.740
Allows the american ambassador to the united nations

01:37:55.380 --> 01:38:00.820
To stand together with all the other members of the security council in a minute of silence

01:38:01.620 --> 01:38:05.300
For reisi's death in the united nations security council

01:38:06.260 --> 01:38:08.260
the israeli ambassador

01:38:09.220 --> 01:38:14.580
Put on a fantastic spectacle the other day. What was it about a week ago when he walked up

01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:17.300
to the podium of the general assembly

01:38:18.260 --> 01:38:20.260
And he took the un charter

01:38:20.260 --> 01:38:27.460
And he shredded it in a mini shredder right there at the podium of the general assembly after the un general assembly condemned israel

01:38:29.140 --> 01:38:34.580
Okay, uh, it's gone too far. It's gone to the international criminal court

01:38:35.940 --> 01:38:37.940
issuing a

01:38:38.500 --> 01:38:41.140
issuing a request for arrest warrants

01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:46.660
For net and yahoo prime minister net and yahoo and defense minister galant

01:38:47.860 --> 01:38:51.060
When at the same time this international criminal court

01:38:51.940 --> 01:38:55.860
Has completely turned a blind eye to all of the other genocidal

01:38:56.580 --> 01:39:03.620
political leaders in afghanistan in iraq during the years of isis in various parts of africa

01:39:05.380 --> 01:39:06.980
It's an outrage

01:39:06.980 --> 01:39:11.780
And we're fast approaching a situation which i depicted in my novella artemis unveiled

01:39:12.340 --> 01:39:14.340
What was it two years ago?

01:39:14.500 --> 01:39:16.500
where israel

01:39:16.900 --> 01:39:18.900
And a new iran

01:39:18.900 --> 01:39:21.140
Are going to wind up a war with the whole world

01:39:22.260 --> 01:39:24.980
That day is coming. We are fast approaching

01:39:25.780 --> 01:39:30.500
That vision of the future dark vision of the future which i articulated in that novella

01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:33.300
And i'm telling you i'm particularly

01:39:33.620 --> 01:39:35.620
the american people

01:39:35.940 --> 01:39:37.460
need to

01:39:37.460 --> 01:39:39.140
change course

01:39:39.140 --> 01:39:41.140
and these uh

01:39:41.140 --> 01:39:42.820
look

01:39:42.820 --> 01:39:47.380
A handful a small group of enthusiastic patriots

01:39:48.500 --> 01:39:51.220
Who went to our capital on january 6th?

01:39:52.740 --> 01:39:57.780
With american flags see they came with american flags

01:39:59.060 --> 01:40:01.060
To storm the capital

01:40:01.780 --> 01:40:04.020
And they're branded as insurgents

01:40:04.660 --> 01:40:07.460
Patriots who come carrying the american flag

01:40:08.180 --> 01:40:10.180
To the people's house

01:40:10.740 --> 01:40:12.740
Are branded as insurgents

01:40:13.060 --> 01:40:15.300
And they're tried under the insurrection act

01:40:15.940 --> 01:40:24.180
You know what insurrection is insurrection is when 40 campuses in our country including all the ivy league and comparable universities

01:40:24.660 --> 01:40:26.420
are taken over

01:40:26.420 --> 01:40:28.420
by a group

01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:33.860
That actually has its orders coming from a chinese front foundation

01:40:34.500 --> 01:40:36.500
where a foreign power

01:40:36.580 --> 01:40:38.180
is

01:40:38.180 --> 01:40:40.180
organizing these takeovers

01:40:41.300 --> 01:40:43.940
And doing it in support of an ideology

01:40:44.740 --> 01:40:47.060
Whose maxim is death to america

01:40:47.620 --> 01:40:49.780
And these people are burning american flags

01:40:50.420 --> 01:40:53.060
Right and calling for the destruction of their own country

01:40:53.540 --> 01:40:55.540
That is an insurrection

01:40:55.620 --> 01:40:57.940
And these people as far as i am concerned

01:40:58.980 --> 01:41:00.980
Need to be rounded up

01:41:01.460 --> 01:41:07.300
And summarily tried not in civil courts because they have stripped themselves of their american citizenship

01:41:07.860 --> 01:41:12.580
They need to be tried in military tribunals under conditions of martial law

01:41:13.380 --> 01:41:18.260
That's what has to happen in this country under trump and if it doesn't we're fucked. It's over

01:41:18.660 --> 01:41:23.380
It's over for this country and it's frankly going to be over for the west as we know it

01:41:24.580 --> 01:41:27.780
So look civil war is a terrible thing

01:41:28.420 --> 01:41:33.300
But unfortunately it's going to happen at this point and we need to make sure that we win it

01:41:34.020 --> 01:41:36.020
Well

01:41:37.220 --> 01:41:39.700
That's going to bring us to super chats right there

01:41:39.700 --> 01:41:44.420
I think that you said everything that there is to say about our current situation

01:41:44.900 --> 01:41:46.900
And what we're going to be

01:41:47.460 --> 01:41:53.460
Expecting one quick note by the way is that the open society foundation and your source and all that

01:41:54.260 --> 01:41:57.380
They despite you know, sores being jewish and whatever

01:41:57.940 --> 01:42:02.180
Have no love towards israel or the west in general

01:42:02.740 --> 01:42:06.020
And that is something that I think a lot of people who are watching this

01:42:06.500 --> 01:42:10.500
Tend to forget they tend to lump jewish people into this

01:42:10.980 --> 01:42:14.980
Whole pile where a lot of the horrible things that you're talking about right now

01:42:15.460 --> 01:42:17.780
They see them as being the cause of

01:42:18.420 --> 01:42:23.060
Let me add something there. Let me add something there. George Soros has

01:42:24.980 --> 01:42:28.420
Ties in his youth to the romanian iron guard

01:42:28.980 --> 01:42:34.420
George Soros has early affiliations to fascist right-wing groups in europe

01:42:36.020 --> 01:42:41.140
Otto Scorzani in the 1970s early late 60s early 70s

01:42:41.780 --> 01:42:44.740
Was doing some things with mosad in israel as well

01:42:45.380 --> 01:42:48.580
Okay, there are complex business

01:42:49.700 --> 01:42:51.700
And and military industrial

01:42:52.260 --> 01:42:54.260
Connections here all across the world

01:42:54.900 --> 01:42:58.260
The point to the fact that certain quote-unquote jews

01:42:59.620 --> 01:43:01.620
Look, I know you're of the ukrainian

01:43:02.420 --> 01:43:06.580
background and that you're sympathetic to the struggle of ukrainian people

01:43:06.900 --> 01:43:10.740
But frankly the same thing can be said of zolinsky in terms of

01:43:12.260 --> 01:43:14.260
fascist

01:43:14.500 --> 01:43:17.380
Ultimately anti-semitic right-wing groups

01:43:17.940 --> 01:43:19.940
using certain jews

01:43:20.580 --> 01:43:25.300
In order to accomplish their aims and forward their agenda

01:43:25.620 --> 01:43:32.580
And here I would direct people to the research of joseph farrell, which I've quoted and cited at length in some of my books

01:43:33.140 --> 01:43:35.380
Now joseph is a dr. Farrell

01:43:36.180 --> 01:43:37.220
is a

01:43:37.220 --> 01:43:40.660
Russian orthodox adherent, okay, so from

01:43:41.220 --> 01:43:45.380
And I you know, I visited ham at his home and we had very nice conversations on so forth

01:43:45.700 --> 01:43:51.780
But you know dr. Farrell essentially would consider me a satanist. Okay, so we are we are not aligned

01:43:52.660 --> 01:43:54.180
spiritually

01:43:54.180 --> 01:43:56.420
And ethically in many ways however

01:43:57.060 --> 01:43:59.060
his research on

01:43:59.540 --> 01:44:01.540
What he calls di spena

01:44:01.940 --> 01:44:04.580
Is impeccable di spena or the spider

01:44:06.020 --> 01:44:10.340
Nickname for odessa the the order of former ss officers

01:44:10.740 --> 01:44:14.020
Which was basically constituted in 1945

01:44:14.580 --> 01:44:21.060
And was part of what what we have been what we have been introduced to as operation paperclip

01:44:21.940 --> 01:44:26.580
There was a lot more going on in terms of the importation of nazis

01:44:27.380 --> 01:44:29.380
post 1945

01:44:29.700 --> 01:44:31.700
They developed a

01:44:31.860 --> 01:44:33.220
global

01:44:33.220 --> 01:44:35.220
financial control system

01:44:35.220 --> 01:44:41.060
And a military industrial network that ultimately has succeeded in capturing the american deep state

01:44:42.020 --> 01:44:45.220
And it is these people not the jews

01:44:45.940 --> 01:44:47.940
Who are ultimately controlling?

01:44:49.460 --> 01:44:52.900
The kind of policy making that's been detrimental to the west

01:44:53.380 --> 01:44:59.380
Including in germany where merkel led in all these migrants if you look at the tentacles

01:45:01.940 --> 01:45:05.620
Around the let's just let me just say it this way around the 9 11 operation

01:45:06.180 --> 01:45:08.500
They go back to institutions like deutschbank

01:45:09.220 --> 01:45:12.980
The bank of germany, okay, and you had you know

01:45:14.900 --> 01:45:20.580
Martin borman hitler's financial mastermind who supposedly died three different times in three different ways

01:45:21.060 --> 01:45:26.900
Still writing checks through chase Manhattan bank in argentina in the 1970s

01:45:28.020 --> 01:45:33.220
Go look at joseph arles research the nazi international the european union and the third way

01:45:34.580 --> 01:45:37.540
The people who have undermined the west

01:45:38.340 --> 01:45:39.780
through

01:45:39.780 --> 01:45:41.780
mass migration

01:45:42.340 --> 01:45:46.740
Social justice agendas and so on so so forth are not jews

01:45:47.780 --> 01:45:49.780
They're nazis

01:45:49.860 --> 01:45:51.860
And their ultimate aim

01:45:51.940 --> 01:45:58.980
Is to foment a backlash. They want a right-wing reaction that they intend

01:46:00.100 --> 01:46:04.900
To ensure is traditionalist in character. This is a sophisticated

01:46:05.140 --> 01:46:11.620
Dialectical operation that's taking place. It's what they were always masters at welton shang's creek

01:46:12.180 --> 01:46:14.020
worldview warfare

01:46:14.020 --> 01:46:15.540
Okay, so

01:46:15.540 --> 01:46:20.980
So that's what I have to say about george soros and his ilk is that their pawns their pawns

01:46:21.860 --> 01:46:22.820
of

01:46:22.820 --> 01:46:26.900
An ss elite that not only survived the end of the war

01:46:27.220 --> 01:46:33.540
It went on to ultimately create a hidden power structure in this world and its aim is a traditionalist

01:46:34.100 --> 01:46:38.500
neo feudal hierarchical system that's going to crush the human individual

01:46:40.100 --> 01:46:44.900
And israel is a bold work against that israel and its 300 nuclear warheads

01:46:46.020 --> 01:46:50.180
The only thing I could say is that uh to all the jews who are still

01:46:50.740 --> 01:46:57.940
Working in you know the new york crimes or any of these you know new republic all these magazines

01:46:58.820 --> 01:47:05.380
I really recommend them to stop being such idiots because I really do think that unfortunately because jews as you know

01:47:05.460 --> 01:47:06.900
They live in the city

01:47:06.900 --> 01:47:10.580
And you can get all kinds of jobs the jobs you end up getting

01:47:11.220 --> 01:47:18.660
The ones that people end up paying the most attention to just because of how information is disseminated would be jobs in the media

01:47:19.220 --> 01:47:25.060
So unfortunately you have this weird situation where the people and I wonder I do wonder if what's going on right now

01:47:25.140 --> 01:47:28.100
These protests are kind of waking some of these people up to their delusions

01:47:28.820 --> 01:47:34.420
That those were the people who ended up rising through the ranks who were disseminating all of this uh, you know

01:47:35.140 --> 01:47:36.740
anti-western

01:47:36.740 --> 01:47:38.020
bullshit

01:47:38.020 --> 01:47:40.020
That uh the unfortunate

01:47:40.260 --> 01:47:46.340
Effect of that is that people look up their names and they do all these 4chan infographics saying that you know

01:47:46.740 --> 01:47:51.700
Jonah goldberg or whoever you know once white people to go extinct and so on and so forth

01:47:52.100 --> 01:47:55.380
So I don't know like as my final question before the super chats

01:47:55.780 --> 01:48:00.500
Do you see any way of remedying that because it seems like until that's remedied

01:48:00.820 --> 01:48:06.020
We're going to have all these people coming out of the woodwork saying like no, they're secretly against us

01:48:06.100 --> 01:48:10.420
They want to overthrow the west. No, I do. I do see a way to remedy it. I do

01:48:11.380 --> 01:48:17.540
And that's that I think that the prime minister net and yahoo and and people like defense minister galant and

01:48:17.780 --> 01:48:22.180
The people who are you know looking into like how october 7th could possibly have been

01:48:22.580 --> 01:48:25.860
Have have happened within mosad and israeli military intelligence

01:48:26.420 --> 01:48:28.420
These because you see there were also

01:48:28.980 --> 01:48:30.980
But israel has been betrayed

01:48:32.020 --> 01:48:34.820
Israel's been betrayed by the kinds of jews in new york that you're talking about

01:48:35.380 --> 01:48:39.460
Jews in la and but israel's also been betrayed by certain jews within israel

01:48:40.180 --> 01:48:44.820
And right now israel has to win this war. That's this primary objective. It has to be achieved

01:48:45.460 --> 01:48:47.460
Without hesitation israel has to win this war

01:48:47.940 --> 01:48:51.380
But don't think there's not going to be a reckoning within israel after this war

01:48:51.700 --> 01:48:57.380
There's a lot of soul searching that's going to take place and there's a massive purge that's coming within israel

01:48:57.460 --> 01:48:59.460
that's what I think I think that

01:49:00.180 --> 01:49:03.780
The right kind of leadership learned a really harsh lesson

01:49:04.260 --> 01:49:06.740
And they know that they have a lot of traders in their midst

01:49:07.380 --> 01:49:13.140
And they're going to clean these people out because these people represent an existential threat to zionism

01:49:13.380 --> 01:49:19.220
They they represent an existential threat to the continued existence of a state of israel

01:49:19.540 --> 01:49:23.860
All right, and I think they're going to need to be weeded out and what I also think is that

01:49:24.980 --> 01:49:26.980
The right kind of zionists

01:49:27.220 --> 01:49:32.660
Right people who are just looking to defend a state for people of jewish descent

01:49:33.700 --> 01:49:40.260
The right kind of zionists are going to find a tremendous ally in the next regime of iran

01:49:40.500 --> 01:49:45.140
A regime that represents the will of the majority of iranian people who love israel

01:49:45.860 --> 01:49:47.860
They love america and they love israel

01:49:48.420 --> 01:49:50.260
and

01:49:50.260 --> 01:49:51.460
I think that

01:49:51.460 --> 01:49:58.500
The kind of intelligence and security relationship that could exist again because it existed once between sabaq wasad

01:49:58.900 --> 01:50:03.620
Very close relationship to the point where they were developing nuclear weapons together. That's a whole other story

01:50:04.100 --> 01:50:05.140
but

01:50:05.140 --> 01:50:08.980
There will be an intelligence and security relationship between the future iranian

01:50:10.900 --> 01:50:12.020
services

01:50:12.020 --> 01:50:17.540
Whether they want to I I'm partial to the idea of calling it sabaq again. I actually think that's a great idea

01:50:17.620 --> 01:50:19.220
What does sabaq mean?

01:50:19.220 --> 01:50:21.220
Oh, it just means

01:50:21.220 --> 01:50:25.220
So I was one am yet of the et alata ke shfar. It means a state

01:50:26.260 --> 01:50:28.260
security and intelligence service

01:50:28.420 --> 01:50:34.020
But you know, it has a horrific aura to it because you know supposedly they tortured people and

01:50:34.580 --> 01:50:39.460
You know engaged in all kinds of repression. Well, who were they who were they interrogating?

01:50:39.700 --> 01:50:41.540
They were interrogating

01:50:41.540 --> 01:50:44.100
A bunch of islamist cockroaches

01:50:44.580 --> 01:50:48.740
Who have turned women into second-class who are beating women right now?

01:50:49.220 --> 01:50:53.220
For exposing their hair, right? Islamists who have completely

01:50:54.580 --> 01:50:59.620
Abrogated freedom of of the press and freedom of speech for the last 45 years in iran

01:51:00.740 --> 01:51:06.180
Those are the people who they were severely interrogating. They were severely interrogating communists

01:51:06.740 --> 01:51:11.460
Who wound who apparently were so faithful to their marxist principles their

01:51:12.340 --> 01:51:13.540
atheistic humanistic

01:51:13.540 --> 01:51:19.540
Universalist marxist principles that all these fucking iranian communists lined up to support a lunatic like ayatollah chomeini

01:51:20.180 --> 01:51:25.940
And to bring a bunch of islamic fundamentalists to power those were the communists being interrogated by sabaq

01:51:26.820 --> 01:51:32.660
All right sabaq was actually doing its job trying to actually the shah was the one who was too much of a bleak part liberal

01:51:33.140 --> 01:51:35.140
Anyway, anyway be that as it may

01:51:35.540 --> 01:51:45.140
My point is that the future iranian state security and intelligence apparatus will have an excellent relationship with mosad and shin bet and and you know the israeli

01:51:46.500 --> 01:51:47.780
services

01:51:47.780 --> 01:51:55.780
So that the iranians i think will be able to help weed out the wrong kind of israelis and the wrong kind of jews even in the united states

01:51:57.620 --> 01:52:00.660
Who are undermining the security of israel

01:52:01.140 --> 01:52:05.700
You know again to reiterate what i said earlier, you know addressing the american people

01:52:06.900 --> 01:52:08.340
understand

01:52:08.340 --> 01:52:14.820
That the domestic political situation in america is a vital national security concern of the future iran

01:52:15.220 --> 01:52:20.580
The future iran is going to find itself immediately in conflict with china in conflict with russia

01:52:20.980 --> 01:52:24.820
Without a europe that it can count on because europe is being taken over by islamists

01:52:25.540 --> 01:52:31.940
Right so who is going to be iran's ally well america israel principally and also america

01:52:32.260 --> 01:52:37.220
So the future iranian state security apparatus cannot very well allow america

01:52:38.020 --> 01:52:40.020
To be a stage for protests

01:52:41.300 --> 01:52:45.460
Then mirror the ideology and discourse of the islamic republic

01:52:46.340 --> 01:52:47.300
understand

01:52:47.300 --> 01:52:54.100
So the domestic political situation in america is going to be a vital national security interest of the future regime of iran

01:52:54.100 --> 01:52:55.700
Let me leave it at that

01:52:55.700 --> 01:52:58.980
Okay, and and that includes whatever misguided jews

01:52:59.060 --> 01:53:04.580
There are who are you know aligning themselves with these apologists for hamas

01:53:04.740 --> 01:53:10.820
Yeah, they uh drank the kool-aid just like all these really beautiful girls that i used to have a crush on and now

01:53:10.900 --> 01:53:12.660
You see their instagram uh

01:53:12.660 --> 01:53:16.340
Story is all like you know pro gaza. Yeah, you know what i mean

01:53:16.340 --> 01:53:19.620
It's it's it's a it's a damn shame like like the song goes

01:53:20.180 --> 01:53:23.380
One last thing i would say is that you know, believe me i know

01:53:23.380 --> 01:53:27.540
Yeah, uh one last thing i would say regarding israel's that i would highly recommend

01:53:27.620 --> 01:53:33.380
I'm sure they're doing it already for masa to take a look at people like romana brahmovich and look at all the

01:53:33.860 --> 01:53:35.620
immigrants from russia

01:53:35.620 --> 01:53:40.260
To israel as far as their effect because netanyahu himself has had too

01:53:40.820 --> 01:53:47.620
Chummy of a relationship with uh putin and i think that's one of the things that misguided him keep in mind how often

01:53:47.860 --> 01:53:53.060
russia's government including putin himself met with representatives of hamas and iran

01:53:54.100 --> 01:53:56.100
Look, um, i i uh

01:53:57.540 --> 01:54:00.900
I am certainly not in favor of the conflict in ukraine

01:54:02.100 --> 01:54:08.980
spiraling into a potential nuclear confrontation between nato and russia that having been said

01:54:09.620 --> 01:54:12.020
As you remember from our previous conversation

01:54:12.660 --> 01:54:17.620
Where vlad was also with us vlad davinson. Yeah, yes, and we were discussing october 7th

01:54:18.340 --> 01:54:20.900
I i told you that i think that

01:54:21.860 --> 01:54:25.620
All these russian jews in the israeli state security apparatus

01:54:26.340 --> 01:54:33.540
Who have ties to the kremlin and we know there are a lot of people in mosad who do they are double agents and they work for russian intelligence as well

01:54:34.100 --> 01:54:35.460
I think uh

01:54:35.460 --> 01:54:39.060
Something went very wrong that day and it did involve the russians

01:54:39.620 --> 01:54:46.420
Um, and it was retribution for frankly netanyahu being dragged kicked and screaming by america to support ukraine

01:54:47.140 --> 01:54:51.220
Uh, but but be that as it may. Yeah, I you know, there's a case to be made that

01:54:51.860 --> 01:54:57.220
Uh, israel was betrayed by russian jews who ultimately were answering to the orders of the kremlin

01:54:57.940 --> 01:54:59.940
And now russia's yeah, I can also tell you

01:55:00.500 --> 01:55:04.340
I'm sorry to say this to the folks who are my final i have a lot of followers who support russia

01:55:04.580 --> 01:55:08.820
But I can tell you that the future regime of iran is going to be an enemy russia. There's no question

01:55:09.380 --> 01:55:12.420
There's and they're right across the kast me and c and by the way

01:55:13.060 --> 01:55:18.420
By the way for people who don't have a sense of history the russians took a quarter of iran's territory

01:55:19.060 --> 01:55:20.260
It's they fought

01:55:20.260 --> 01:55:25.700
Two significant wars with iran and they're responsible for taking a quarter of iran's territory

01:55:25.860 --> 01:55:31.940
So there's a lot of bad blood there and I can well see that there's going to be a future iranian-israeli alliance

01:55:32.660 --> 01:55:34.660
Even just against russia

01:55:35.780 --> 01:55:42.020
Well onto uh onto super chats we go so the first super chat is uh from somebody who

01:55:42.500 --> 01:55:48.020
Did it last time? Uh, but I unfortunately was not able to get to it. So um, here remind me today

01:55:48.500 --> 01:55:54.340
As a reminder my question was of jason has seen the mh 370 videos

01:55:54.740 --> 01:56:00.260
That's the hidden tech held by the shadow government and before uh, you respond jason once again

01:56:00.420 --> 01:56:07.140
Make sure to like subscribe comment click the bell the bell is very important. Uh, anyway, uh, jason, uh, go ahead

01:56:07.220 --> 01:56:14.020
I've seen it. I've heard analyses of it. Uh, I

01:56:15.380 --> 01:56:17.380
Have listened to

01:56:17.460 --> 01:56:19.460
intelligent people who I really respect

01:56:19.540 --> 01:56:22.020
Who have uh, in some cases said they

01:56:22.820 --> 01:56:27.860
They think it's legit and in other cases. Um other people who I respect equally

01:56:28.420 --> 01:56:33.140
Uh have raised questions about you know, uh, the the legitimacy

01:56:34.020 --> 01:56:36.020
And fidelity of that video

01:56:36.100 --> 01:56:43.620
Um, whether or not that particular footage is is accurate, you know, it's it's showing these three UFOs

01:56:44.340 --> 01:56:50.420
circling around mh 370 and basically creating a vortex which the airplane then disappears into

01:56:50.820 --> 01:56:54.820
That's what it shows and supposedly it was leaked by a high level official

01:56:55.380 --> 01:57:03.940
Um, and the footage was taken by classified satellites who were looking down at the area that the plane was transiting at the time

01:57:04.900 --> 01:57:09.700
Whether or not that particular footage is legit. I think that technology exists

01:57:11.940 --> 01:57:13.540
Hmm

01:57:13.540 --> 01:57:15.540
Jane Dominic ten dollars

01:57:16.100 --> 01:57:21.140
Questions for Jojani. Do you see any room for bacchic mania muse inspiration?

01:57:21.460 --> 01:57:29.460
Jungian individuation or some form of serious promethean divinization in the future of philosophical inquiry

01:57:31.620 --> 01:57:33.620
The hell do you think i'm doing

01:57:34.900 --> 01:57:40.420
I mean, that's the core of my whole philosophical project. Yeah, that's pretty softball

01:57:41.060 --> 01:57:43.060
Of course, I do. Yeah

01:57:43.060 --> 01:57:47.620
Uh, all right moving on here. Uh, yeah, the ones that we could just answer fast. We could just answer fast

01:57:48.180 --> 01:57:50.180
Austin ten bucks

01:57:50.260 --> 01:57:56.020
Ethmogens have been administered in traditional cultures to aid in the development of these psychic abilities

01:57:56.180 --> 01:57:59.380
Especially for individuals who struggle with the training

01:57:59.940 --> 01:58:02.180
Uh, well comment any thoughts on it

01:58:03.140 --> 01:58:10.420
It should be some combination thereof, you know, I mean the right drugs properly used as the Greeks called them pharma kea

01:58:10.820 --> 01:58:12.420
you know, the right

01:58:12.420 --> 01:58:14.420
Pharmacons properly administered

01:58:15.060 --> 01:58:21.060
Um, together with various psychical training regiments are probably the way to go

01:58:22.580 --> 01:58:28.180
Hmm, but that's drugs as a tool and the craft rather than as an escape

01:58:28.660 --> 01:58:30.660
hmm

01:58:30.660 --> 01:58:34.660
No, that's true because when it comes psychedelics, you don't want it to become a crutch

01:58:35.460 --> 01:58:36.660
right

01:58:36.660 --> 01:58:39.380
Or an escape form of escapism. Mm-hmm

01:58:40.420 --> 01:58:43.780
Uh, cerulean valley. I don't know if this was a mistake

01:58:44.660 --> 01:58:48.260
100 dollars. Thank you so much cerulean valley

01:58:48.820 --> 01:58:53.860
Uh, okay. Here we go. They in quotes are more advanced in every field

01:58:54.180 --> 01:59:01.620
Um, uh, you speak of ludite ism will be psychologically healthy for most inhabitants on this planet

01:59:02.020 --> 01:59:05.540
You can't even astral project. It's not your choice

01:59:05.940 --> 01:59:09.780
But just accept their traditionalist dominion over you

01:59:10.420 --> 01:59:12.420
You will lose

01:59:13.300 --> 01:59:17.300
First of all, I have astral projected second of all, uh

01:59:18.260 --> 01:59:25.620
That's perfectly fine if traditionalism is going to be suitable for the majority of the planet in that case

01:59:25.700 --> 01:59:33.220
I'm interested in eliminating the majority that are going to subjugate the minority of people who absolutely do not deserve to have their

01:59:33.300 --> 01:59:39.380
Individuality subsumed by traditionalism. Okay. I am a radically anti-majoritarian person

01:59:39.700 --> 01:59:46.420
I'm the furthest thing from a populist you can ever imagine. I am for the individual. I'm a radical individualist

01:59:46.820 --> 01:59:51.700
Who's totally devoted to the defense of liberty and progress

01:59:52.340 --> 01:59:53.460
so

01:59:53.460 --> 01:59:59.620
Think again, okay, and I can also tell you that as I've had to incessantly repeat every time someone

02:00:00.260 --> 02:00:03.700
Asks as if this is a question asks a question like this

02:00:06.020 --> 02:00:08.020
That number one

02:00:08.420 --> 02:00:12.900
Going back to what you asked me love about buddha, right many of our conversation number one

02:00:13.780 --> 02:00:16.980
There's another class of beings opposed to the olympians

02:00:17.700 --> 02:00:20.980
Or the devas namely the ashuras or the titans

02:00:21.380 --> 02:00:25.060
They're in the mix here and they're very angry people. If you think i'm angry

02:00:25.300 --> 02:00:31.220
You see what these people are like. This is why the buddhas depicted them as demons. I mean, they're very angry people very violent people

02:00:31.780 --> 02:00:35.780
They've had nuclear wars in the past. You look at the mahabarata and the ramayana

02:00:36.580 --> 02:00:39.620
and you look at uh, libyan desert glass

02:00:40.260 --> 02:00:43.780
And you know various vitrified stones in south america

02:00:44.260 --> 02:00:49.780
You can see the evidence for the nuclear wars between the ashuras and the devas in the distant past

02:00:50.180 --> 02:00:53.700
so to begin with the ashuras are in the mix and

02:00:55.540 --> 02:01:00.260
Look their policy is that they don't want to have to come in and solve the problem for us

02:01:00.500 --> 02:01:03.700
They want to see some kind of human initiative and frankly

02:01:04.900 --> 02:01:08.020
It's much better for us if we tried to determine

02:01:08.980 --> 02:01:13.380
Our own future course and set the conditions for

02:01:14.420 --> 02:01:19.380
You know securing our liberty by ourselves to the greatest extent possible

02:01:19.700 --> 02:01:25.380
We don't want to be beholden to some group of titans or ashuras either. Remember prometheus is this rather

02:01:26.020 --> 02:01:29.620
ambiguous trickster figure who initially betrays the titans

02:01:30.020 --> 02:01:34.100
Decide with the gods and then turns on the gods to defend humanity, right?

02:01:34.420 --> 02:01:39.460
So looking at it from a promethean perspective, I don't want us to be beholden to the ashuras

02:01:40.020 --> 02:01:42.020
The the titans either

02:01:42.020 --> 02:01:45.380
But they're in the mix and they're very powerful. They're very powerful

02:01:45.620 --> 02:01:52.100
They're the reason why there's not a biosphere on mars anymore. Okay, so whoever quote, you know made this

02:01:52.740 --> 02:01:53.860
Uh

02:01:53.860 --> 02:02:00.340
statement is forgetting that and what's more important than that is that quite apart from the ashuras

02:02:00.740 --> 02:02:06.100
You have this entity that I spent some time discussing which, you know, I come around to

02:02:06.980 --> 02:02:13.940
Uh engaging with at the end of philosophy of the future this trickster this cosmic trickster and its various

02:02:14.740 --> 02:02:21.300
avatars and emissaries and that force is so much more powerful than the debuts

02:02:22.180 --> 02:02:26.740
And that's why when I talk about phenomenal authorization, I make the point that look

02:02:26.980 --> 02:02:28.980
This trickster

02:02:29.940 --> 02:02:32.980
Sees the movements of the devas

02:02:34.180 --> 02:02:38.100
Not necessarily like movements of chess pieces across a chess board

02:02:38.500 --> 02:02:43.700
Because the game is more like backgammon. It involves an element of chance a roll of the die

02:02:44.180 --> 02:02:48.020
But it's kind of like a backgammon game except that the trickster

02:02:50.180 --> 02:02:55.700
Can win but the trickster is interested in the game and the possibilities opened up by the game

02:02:56.340 --> 02:03:02.500
Okay, so frankly the person who posed this who made this statement is utterly clueless

02:03:03.060 --> 02:03:09.220
Hmm. Well, he thinks you're a heretic. That's the other thing. Well, I am a yeah. Well, he's right about that

02:03:10.820 --> 02:03:16.980
Who I'm a Muslim. Yeah, and you can be born into any religion. I was born muslim

02:03:17.140 --> 02:03:21.300
So I'm not just a heretic. I'm an apostate. He gets pretty rude over here

02:03:21.300 --> 02:03:25.700
But if you'd like I can read you his five dollar chat right after the one hundred dollar one

02:03:27.700 --> 02:03:29.700
Let's spend more time on somebody's

02:03:30.420 --> 02:03:32.420
You know, who's

02:03:32.980 --> 02:03:37.700
Yeah, yeah, the the cherry on top give other people. Yeah trial size dove

02:03:38.340 --> 02:03:43.620
$10 seems to me the birth of humanity is a radically anomalous and finite event

02:03:43.940 --> 02:03:49.140
With this entity working to coax as much growth potential from us before that energy dissipates

02:03:50.100 --> 02:03:54.180
Say that again one more time sure lower. Okay. Here we go

02:03:54.900 --> 02:03:55.940
Um

02:03:55.940 --> 02:04:01.460
Seems to me the birth of humanity is radically anomalous and finite event

02:04:01.860 --> 02:04:08.260
With this entity working to coax as much growth potential from us before that energy dissipates

02:04:08.500 --> 02:04:22.500
It's a question of scale it goes back to when you were talking about we can imagine that there's a macrocosm that's you know

02:04:23.620 --> 02:04:25.060
Has you know

02:04:25.060 --> 02:04:27.620
Vast in such and such a way and there's all kinds of

02:04:28.340 --> 02:04:33.460
intelligences that are potentially so far beyond ours and well, you know, you could imagine a context

02:04:34.980 --> 02:04:36.980
That would render humanity

02:04:38.500 --> 02:04:40.500
this relatively unexpected

02:04:41.620 --> 02:04:42.820
and

02:04:42.820 --> 02:04:44.820
anomalous

02:04:47.060 --> 02:04:51.940
Phenomenon which this trickster is taking great pains to

02:04:53.300 --> 02:04:59.620
Cultivate right and to nurture albeit, you know as a very severe mother

02:05:01.620 --> 02:05:06.900
That's you could imagine that but again you're imagining a context for which there's no empirical evidence

02:05:07.460 --> 02:05:10.820
And when you look at the literature of close encounters, that's not

02:05:11.300 --> 02:05:14.980
Of the picture that we get you know, I don't want to repeat myself like I said earlier

02:05:15.540 --> 02:05:18.580
the close encounter phenomenon suggests that actually

02:05:20.100 --> 02:05:21.620
humanity

02:05:21.620 --> 02:05:24.340
or the evolution of humanity

02:05:24.980 --> 02:05:26.980
into a potentially

02:05:26.980 --> 02:05:28.900
superhuman species

02:05:28.900 --> 02:05:33.780
Is at the center of the cosmos that it's the central phenomenon of existence

02:05:34.020 --> 02:05:36.020
Chester ten dollars

02:05:37.540 --> 02:05:44.020
Ca, ca, that is uh, that is chester right there. Uh, great friend of the show

02:05:44.660 --> 02:05:48.740
Um, next we have ashton milky way 50 dollars

02:05:49.380 --> 02:05:56.340
Sorry jason, but how can you look at the Rothschild history of banking and the history of banking in general?

02:05:56.660 --> 02:06:03.060
And say that the jews are not the ones controlling the system. I think you're foolish for believing in their propaganda

02:06:04.260 --> 02:06:06.420
Read joseph arles books. He also has

02:06:07.220 --> 02:06:09.220
Uh texts that are specifically

02:06:10.180 --> 02:06:12.180
Dedicated to the history of banking

02:06:12.900 --> 02:06:14.900
Like the financial vipers of venice

02:06:15.700 --> 02:06:17.700
um, and

02:06:17.860 --> 02:06:22.820
When you read his work on the development of the international banking system

02:06:23.620 --> 02:06:28.260
In the context of his tracing the genealogy of what you might call the fourth Reich

02:06:28.820 --> 02:06:30.980
This occulted Reich, which i've written about

02:06:31.300 --> 02:06:33.300
You can see

02:06:33.860 --> 02:06:42.820
To what extent various banking families including ones of jewish descent were assimilated and ensconced by this essentially

02:06:43.540 --> 02:06:45.380
uh

02:06:45.380 --> 02:06:47.860
I don't even want to call it fascist. I don't know

02:06:49.140 --> 02:06:53.140
Nazi post-nazi system, right? Um

02:06:53.860 --> 02:06:58.340
Joseph's work is is what you should look at if you're interested in actually understanding what's going on here

02:06:59.300 --> 02:07:06.980
And so i'll just leave it at that. Hmm. That would be the same author to look at as far as um hitler being funded

02:07:07.300 --> 02:07:11.940
Because it's weird like i was watching this uh gentleman on youtube named tick history

02:07:12.180 --> 02:07:15.060
and he tries to make well first of all he makes the case that uh, uh,

02:07:15.700 --> 02:07:19.300
Nazi germany was very socialist in how it operated

02:07:19.300 --> 02:07:25.460
But the second thing is that he tries to say well hitler was not funded by any of these rich people

02:07:25.460 --> 02:07:30.580
It was a very grass roots movement, you know, they raised their money from the people

02:07:31.780 --> 02:07:33.780
shit

02:07:34.980 --> 02:07:38.420
I mean look the thula gazelle shaft consisted of a bunch of barons and aristocrats

02:07:38.580 --> 02:07:44.340
And it's the thula gazelle shaft that set up the nsdap as a as a pack as a political action committee

02:07:44.500 --> 02:07:49.060
To help fight communism on the streets of germany. So we you know, we know that the

02:07:49.780 --> 02:07:56.100
Planning the master mining of the rise of hitler came from very rich people with international banking connections

02:07:56.820 --> 02:08:02.340
Though hitler himself was not a big fan of the uh aristocracy at least from what i understand

02:08:02.900 --> 02:08:06.980
There was this a lady who i think you met as well at that event that we were at

02:08:07.380 --> 02:08:10.580
Who talked about how um her father was this german aristocrat?

02:08:10.740 --> 02:08:17.140
He was a general and hitler used to pin medals on him in such a way as to puncture his, uh, skin

02:08:17.540 --> 02:08:21.700
And she interpreted that as being his hatred for this upper echelon

02:08:23.300 --> 02:08:27.620
He was a rabble rouser who had a very specific purpose and

02:08:28.340 --> 02:08:30.100
mission to fulfill

02:08:30.100 --> 02:08:32.260
They used him

02:08:32.260 --> 02:08:40.260
Okay, and that became abundantly clear to the sad broken man when he was put out to pasture in bariloche argentina

02:08:40.660 --> 02:08:42.660
in 1946

02:08:42.660 --> 02:08:49.540
Until listen hair hitler just paint your sunsets leave it to us. We've got it all under control

02:08:50.100 --> 02:08:56.660
Okay, i think he lived a very sad last 20 years of his life down there in, uh, argentina

02:08:57.460 --> 02:09:03.140
And it became abundantly clear to him that he had been played and used by people

02:09:03.620 --> 02:09:09.380
Whose machinations he could not even begin to wrap his mind around and those people are still in control of our world today

02:09:10.340 --> 02:09:11.700
Damn

02:09:11.700 --> 02:09:14.500
Well, uh, we're here. We have fin brown ten dollars

02:09:15.220 --> 02:09:20.180
So we have two remaining here unless anybody sends anything else. These would be the last two so fin brown

02:09:20.900 --> 02:09:25.620
$10 thoughts on the concept of a live live player

02:09:26.580 --> 02:09:28.580
non npc types

02:09:30.180 --> 02:09:35.300
Thoughts on npc's no no no the live player so the opposite of what an npc is

02:09:35.860 --> 02:09:41.540
What about what thoughts i mean out of the concept like what exactly entails a live player well in your book

02:09:41.540 --> 02:09:43.220
you were writing about

02:09:43.220 --> 02:09:45.060
consciousness and

02:09:45.060 --> 02:09:50.020
Whether you see there being like this great asian of consciousness where people who would be more like the npc's

02:09:50.420 --> 02:09:55.700
Would have less of it and people would who would be more of the players to have more of it or is it much more distinct?

02:09:56.820 --> 02:09:58.820
individuality

02:09:58.980 --> 02:10:00.980
Personal conscience

02:10:01.300 --> 02:10:03.300
You know self reflection

02:10:03.780 --> 02:10:05.780
critical thinking

02:10:05.780 --> 02:10:07.780
Above all creative vision

02:10:08.180 --> 02:10:12.260
Right all the things that these protesters we see in the streets today lack

02:10:13.300 --> 02:10:16.820
And by the way, I just want to make one point that I neglected to make earlier

02:10:17.060 --> 02:10:21.300
Is that because a lot of you know underserting people will say oh, but what about you know

02:10:21.380 --> 02:10:28.100
The communists who took over columbia university in 1968 and so forth, you know on behalf of the students for a democratic society sds

02:10:28.180 --> 02:10:30.420
Or let's say the activities of the weather underground

02:10:31.380 --> 02:10:35.780
Completely different completely different. Look

02:10:36.500 --> 02:10:41.780
Uh, you don't have to be a communist or agree with communism to understand why

02:10:42.580 --> 02:10:50.820
Dropping napalm on vietnamese children was not a just war. Okay, the vietnam war was an unjust war

02:10:51.300 --> 02:10:53.300
Okay, at least at least

02:10:53.780 --> 02:10:58.340
One can understand a person who takes that position and protests the war

02:10:58.740 --> 02:11:05.620
And also if you look at the doctrine of classic communism going back, you know to marx supposedly

02:11:06.420 --> 02:11:08.420
However misguided you may think it is

02:11:09.300 --> 02:11:10.820
It's ultimately

02:11:10.820 --> 02:11:12.820
an aspiration for

02:11:12.900 --> 02:11:16.180
liberation and enlightenment and an egalitarian

02:11:16.980 --> 02:11:22.980
world society where you know women have more equal after all look the soviet union sent women into space

02:11:24.020 --> 02:11:26.020
Way before we did okay

02:11:26.340 --> 02:11:33.780
So there are things that you can respect about classic communism and about the communists who took over columbia university in 1968

02:11:35.300 --> 02:11:40.900
The cockroaches and vermin and parasites today who have desecrated those places

02:11:42.020 --> 02:11:46.900
Have also hollowed out anything that was respectable about communist ideology

02:11:47.460 --> 02:11:53.220
They have in fact imploded communist ideology by aligning themselves to the most traditionalist and retarded

02:11:54.180 --> 02:11:58.500
You know religious tradition on the planet namely islam

02:11:59.540 --> 02:12:01.540
And by the way, this is a rerun for me

02:12:01.540 --> 02:12:07.860
It's a horrific rerun because all of us who have some iranian heritage saw this happen in iran in 1978 1979

02:12:08.020 --> 02:12:13.140
We're all the fucking leftists suddenly somehow forgot marx and got behind ayatollah homani and the molas

02:12:13.460 --> 02:12:19.220
That's why we have an islamic republic today. It's the leftists in iran who brought the islamic republic to power

02:12:19.460 --> 02:12:25.300
They were the firepower behind it. They were the guerrilla fighters who toppled the shah's regime not these turbans molas

02:12:25.700 --> 02:12:31.460
It's the leftists who did it. So look, I don't know what that says. I don't I won't blame marx for it though

02:12:32.580 --> 02:12:36.740
If you look back in my work, you see I actually you respect marx a great deal

02:12:36.980 --> 02:12:40.580
The thing is that his followers have now come to the point where

02:12:41.300 --> 02:12:46.740
Evidently, you know, they've become the the epitome of these zombie NPCs

02:12:47.540 --> 02:12:51.220
And so I don't see, uh, you know a legitimate future for leftists

02:12:51.700 --> 02:12:57.460
And the ussr was also supporting palestine back in the day era fat was an agent of the soviets

02:12:58.420 --> 02:13:04.900
No, okay, but that's not there because the ussr was also the first and greatest supporter of the state of israel

02:13:04.980 --> 02:13:06.980
That's true. Well, that's before israel

02:13:07.540 --> 02:13:09.540
You could say kind of betrayed it

02:13:09.540 --> 02:13:15.700
Yes, so is the soviets felt betrayed by israel because actually the soviets were the first supporters of israel

02:13:16.100 --> 02:13:17.220
before

02:13:17.220 --> 02:13:24.180
France and france became the second strongest supporter of israel and then united states only really started supporting israel after canadi

02:13:24.980 --> 02:13:28.740
No, that's true. Yeah, you have a point there. So, uh, over here, although

02:13:28.980 --> 02:13:29.860
I

02:13:29.860 --> 02:13:35.380
Do remember reading that the soviets were also the ones who coined the term palestinian, but that's like going in a whole

02:13:36.260 --> 02:13:41.540
Rabbit hole as far as where these terms originate from, you know, well the woman's going to turn palestinian

02:13:41.540 --> 02:13:48.340
No, I mean like palestinian in the context of what happened after israel, you know, as far as like the palestinian people versus the

02:13:48.900 --> 02:13:54.820
Yeah, well, no, I wouldn't I wouldn't be shocked that that came out of some soviet propaganda office. So here we have a

02:13:55.860 --> 02:13:57.940
Valhulm 10 dollars

02:13:57.940 --> 02:14:02.980
How does the world that results out of the niches split of humanity into ubermench and entermench?

02:14:03.460 --> 02:14:04.740
Is any

02:14:04.740 --> 02:14:10.420
Functionally different than what the davis have constructed with their breakaway civilization

02:14:12.260 --> 02:14:21.540
Because what the davis are envisioning is a hierarchical caste society where there are different rungs of human beings in that society

02:14:21.940 --> 02:14:30.340
Okay, until you get to the highest rung which is a a priestly class the brahmin whose sole purpose is to serve the davis

02:14:30.580 --> 02:14:36.660
It's a caste hierarchy. What niches talking about is essentially the destruction of humanity

02:14:37.780 --> 02:14:38.660
through

02:14:38.660 --> 02:14:45.220
The under mention becoming a machinery of production. These aren't human beings anymore. We're not talking about human beings anymore

02:14:46.100 --> 02:14:48.100
It's it's a completely

02:14:48.100 --> 02:14:53.620
It and by the way, niches doesn't describe this a great length because it's right at the margin

02:14:54.020 --> 02:14:57.140
Of what he can really what he's really capable of contemplating

02:14:57.860 --> 02:15:02.820
In terms of how technological advancement is going to alter the human condition

02:15:03.060 --> 02:15:06.100
There are a few notes on this in the will to power mainly

02:15:06.660 --> 02:15:14.420
Where you see him describe how the machinery of production as he puts it is going to ensconce and transform

02:15:14.740 --> 02:15:17.300
the under mention into a

02:15:18.100 --> 02:15:19.860
base upon which

02:15:19.860 --> 02:15:22.100
The ubermen pursue their own destinies

02:15:22.740 --> 02:15:25.220
But the ubermen are not slave masters

02:15:25.540 --> 02:15:31.220
The under mention are not slaves of the ubermen nicha really belabors this point niches

02:15:31.460 --> 02:15:34.980
Entire ethical doctrine is a critique of slave morality

02:15:35.620 --> 02:15:38.100
Right and an advocacy for a kind of

02:15:38.660 --> 02:15:44.580
Morality where the individual sets his own goals and purposes and is not dependent upon

02:15:45.380 --> 02:15:49.220
Basically, you know oppressing and manipulating anybody else. Yeah

02:15:50.020 --> 02:15:52.740
Okay, so so it's a radically different vision

02:15:53.540 --> 02:15:55.540
Actually, it's a much

02:15:56.500 --> 02:16:01.700
And I've said this before it's a much harsher vision because to the extent that most people don't want to be free

02:16:01.940 --> 02:16:04.500
And most people want to be cattle and most people are sheep

02:16:04.900 --> 02:16:10.340
Well, then the dave of vision is much more compassionate because it accommodates that majority inside this pyramid

02:16:10.660 --> 02:16:14.260
Nietzsche's vision is saying listen either evolve or you're going to be a machine

02:16:16.420 --> 02:16:19.780
Next super chat over here we have uh from uh kalab

02:16:20.820 --> 02:16:25.300
Your uh ten dollars your thoughts about the global loss of res publica

02:16:25.860 --> 02:16:30.260
And its replacement in the internet where the public ceases to

02:16:31.060 --> 02:16:37.300
Check and balance richard senates the fall of public man comes to mind

02:16:42.100 --> 02:16:46.500
Look, I think that the republic first of all the republic was a noble idea

02:16:47.620 --> 02:16:50.500
Especially if we take care to discern

02:16:51.700 --> 02:16:53.700
um, you know

02:16:54.020 --> 02:16:59.460
To to make a distinction between a republican constitutional structure and a democracy

02:17:00.100 --> 02:17:07.060
The kind of republican constitutional structure that the founding fathers of the united states articulated in our constitution and our bill of rights

02:17:07.860 --> 02:17:10.580
was a very noble minded

02:17:11.220 --> 02:17:17.620
Uh and progressive endeavor in the proper sense of the word progressive which I entirely embrace

02:17:18.580 --> 02:17:21.380
And intend to safeguard against these retarded leftists

02:17:22.900 --> 02:17:28.100
But the fact of the matter is that even by the middle of the 20th century with the rise of

02:17:29.860 --> 02:17:30.980
you know

02:17:30.980 --> 02:17:38.420
instantaneous global banking and military industrial corporations and mega corporations and you know

02:17:40.500 --> 02:17:43.620
You know supersonic air travel and so on and so forth

02:17:44.580 --> 02:17:47.780
And and the and attendant global business class and

02:17:49.060 --> 02:17:51.060
Such developments

02:17:51.060 --> 02:17:56.900
Already rendered the republic an antiquated form of political organization. That is the case

02:17:57.700 --> 02:18:00.660
Uh, it was already the case in the 1950s, frankly

02:18:01.700 --> 02:18:07.380
And certainly as we approach the technological singularity, we're going to have to consider

02:18:08.100 --> 02:18:14.340
A new form of political organization that safeguards the liberty and creative potential of the individual

02:18:15.140 --> 02:18:17.380
um, and that replaces republics

02:18:18.100 --> 02:18:23.140
And that replaces nation states as we've conceived of them thus thus far, right?

02:18:24.020 --> 02:18:26.020
Now I don't want that to be any kind of world government

02:18:26.500 --> 02:18:27.540
but

02:18:27.540 --> 02:18:29.540
We need to come up with a a

02:18:29.860 --> 02:18:33.300
A replacement for the republic that at the same time

02:18:33.940 --> 02:18:41.140
In spirit safeguards what it is that let's say the bill of rights of our republic was intended to protect

02:18:41.940 --> 02:18:43.940
So I don't see the

02:18:44.100 --> 02:18:48.500
The obsolescence of the republic of the res publica as a necessarily

02:18:49.460 --> 02:18:51.060
negative

02:18:51.140 --> 02:18:53.140
Development I see it as an evolutionary

02:18:53.860 --> 02:18:55.780
eventuality

02:18:55.780 --> 02:18:57.620
And as far as the internet is concerned

02:18:57.620 --> 02:19:03.940
I think the problem with the internet is that the worldwide web is increasingly controlled by mega corporations

02:19:04.740 --> 02:19:06.100
and that

02:19:06.100 --> 02:19:09.540
What we need to do is develop blockchain networks

02:19:10.100 --> 02:19:15.620
That use the fundamental substrate technology of the internet in ways that

02:19:16.180 --> 02:19:20.500
Are impervious to corporate and other centralized control

02:19:21.940 --> 02:19:25.620
Absolutely. So here we have ashton milky way 20 dollars

02:19:25.700 --> 02:19:31.780
How can we possibly prepare for the technological singularity and the coming catastrophe in the next 20 years?

02:19:34.580 --> 02:19:36.580
Who is we?

02:19:36.900 --> 02:19:39.540
One of the point and you've heard me say this yes, yes

02:19:40.260 --> 02:19:43.300
one of the points that I I always make is that

02:19:44.900 --> 02:19:48.500
Considering that we have maybe 15 maybe 20 years

02:19:49.060 --> 02:19:53.620
Between us and the technological singularity at this point. I keep revising my estimate downward

02:19:55.700 --> 02:19:57.700
There's no way that the world can prepare

02:19:58.100 --> 02:19:59.540
There's no way

02:19:59.540 --> 02:20:03.460
Simply impossible the vast majority of people

02:20:04.500 --> 02:20:09.140
Who are either adherents of islam by 20 again? I repeat the statistic

02:20:09.620 --> 02:20:16.500
Given current demographic trend and by the way people should remember this every time they call what's going on in gaza a genocide

02:20:17.460 --> 02:20:19.460
The palestinians are arabs

02:20:20.420 --> 02:20:22.420
majority of them arab muslims

02:20:23.140 --> 02:20:28.900
There are 22 arab countries in the world all of which by the way refuse to take in these palestinians

02:20:29.460 --> 02:20:30.900
okay

02:20:30.900 --> 02:20:35.300
And beyond the arab world. There are gigantic countries like malaysia

02:20:35.860 --> 02:20:37.860
indonesia pakistan

02:20:38.580 --> 02:20:44.500
That are host to huge muslim populations. India has more muslims in it than pakistan

02:20:44.660 --> 02:20:49.860
Okay, so we are dealing with a population bomb here

02:20:51.060 --> 02:20:53.780
Which is going to result in it and by the way when you think about you know

02:20:53.780 --> 02:20:56.900
These people's proposals to turn the united nations into a global democracy

02:20:57.060 --> 02:21:01.700
Well, what the fuck would a global democracy be in 2075 when the majority of people on the earth are muslim?

02:21:02.340 --> 02:21:06.500
So every time these morons talk about what's going on in gaza as a genocide

02:21:06.740 --> 02:21:08.740
they ought to remember that a

02:21:09.460 --> 02:21:14.260
muslim majority on this planet by 2075 means the genocide of

02:21:14.740 --> 02:21:19.940
Every other culture on earth because we know and especially we who have an iranian heritage know

02:21:20.500 --> 02:21:26.420
That what islam does is genocide other cultures the specialty of islam is the genocide of other cultures

02:21:26.740 --> 02:21:32.980
And we we see it just recently in iraq with isis what they did to the Kurds

02:21:33.780 --> 02:21:37.700
By the way, recently there was a story that made me absolutely incensed

02:21:38.260 --> 02:21:42.180
as if you know as if there isn't enough to be incensed about story of a

02:21:42.900 --> 02:21:44.900
Kurdish woman

02:21:44.980 --> 02:21:48.100
Who was raped and held captive by isis in northern iraq

02:21:49.220 --> 02:21:54.820
And she wrote this book and she was supposed to give a presentation about it. I believe it was in canada

02:21:56.100 --> 02:21:58.100
And her book event

02:21:58.340 --> 02:22:01.300
Was cancelled because they were afraid

02:22:02.020 --> 02:22:04.020
It would promote islamophobia

02:22:05.060 --> 02:22:09.140
So this poor woman who was tortured and raped by isis

02:22:09.620 --> 02:22:16.180
Doesn't get to tell her story about what muslims are like because it might promote fear of islam

02:22:16.900 --> 02:22:22.740
Just we we are living already in an orwellian 1984 world. It is as bad as that

02:22:22.900 --> 02:22:29.700
Oh, all I could say is as that all I could say is that the people who are afraid of confronting these kind of things

02:22:30.260 --> 02:22:32.260
Get what they deserve

02:22:32.820 --> 02:22:38.740
Because if you are not afraid and you are willing to accept the consequences and fight for what you believe in

02:22:39.140 --> 02:22:41.140
Yes, there's going to be pushback

02:22:41.460 --> 02:22:46.740
But at least you could actually sleep at night knowing that you're not going to uh, you know

02:22:46.820 --> 02:22:52.260
Be one of these uh yellow bellied cowards who just allow all of this uh to go on

02:22:52.820 --> 02:22:58.580
Yeah, but to answer your question, sure, they're gonna get what's coming. So but to answer your question, the problem is this

02:23:00.580 --> 02:23:02.580
In the face of the technological singularity

02:23:03.620 --> 02:23:05.460
15 to 20 years from now

02:23:05.540 --> 02:23:11.060
How do you expect that the world or people at large people writ large when you say that

02:23:12.100 --> 02:23:14.100
Are going to prepare for the singularity

02:23:15.060 --> 02:23:15.940
when

02:23:15.940 --> 02:23:19.940
increasingly, uh, you know, we have a muslim majority on the planet

02:23:20.660 --> 02:23:24.660
And uh, the rest of the people are either confusion chinese

02:23:25.220 --> 02:23:31.140
Who are ultimately as regressive and uh inimical to change and progress

02:23:31.780 --> 02:23:37.300
And we have uh, putin with 3000 nuclear warheads embracing russian orthodoxy

02:23:37.620 --> 02:23:39.620
And then we see what's going on in the west

02:23:40.100 --> 02:23:42.420
Where there's mass conversion to islam in europe

02:23:43.060 --> 02:23:46.500
And there's american university students going around

02:23:47.060 --> 02:23:48.100
uh

02:23:48.100 --> 02:23:55.060
chanting death to america slogans from a fundamentalist islamic regime and and uh converting to islam

02:23:55.700 --> 02:23:57.700
under the palestinian flag

02:23:57.700 --> 02:23:59.700
so

02:23:59.780 --> 02:24:03.620
What what world what world prepare for the technological singularity? No, no, no, no, no

02:24:04.820 --> 02:24:06.820
A small minority

02:24:07.220 --> 02:24:09.220
of people with promethean

02:24:09.380 --> 02:24:11.380
foresight and forethought

02:24:11.940 --> 02:24:14.180
Who care about preserving their own liberty

02:24:14.980 --> 02:24:17.620
And maximizing their own creative potential

02:24:18.260 --> 02:24:20.660
Are gonna band together as a group of rebels

02:24:21.220 --> 02:24:23.780
Like the rebels who set the american revolution in motion

02:24:24.340 --> 02:24:28.820
And we are gonna defend our future our future at any cost

02:24:30.420 --> 02:24:32.420
Liberty or death

02:24:33.700 --> 02:24:39.780
Austin ten dollars is there any chance that iran rid itself of the horrific theocracy now in place?

02:24:40.900 --> 02:24:47.620
And restore its traditional empire and dignity as a great culture and civilization between east and west

02:24:48.180 --> 02:24:52.740
And that's going to be like the final super chat before that cherry on top that we uh talked about but yeah

02:24:53.460 --> 02:24:55.460
Of course it will happen

02:24:55.460 --> 02:24:58.660
Of someone who's worked for that for many years of my life

02:24:59.780 --> 02:25:02.420
I can tell you it will most certainly happen

02:25:03.300 --> 02:25:04.580
but

02:25:04.580 --> 02:25:07.460
There is in that process an absolutely

02:25:08.500 --> 02:25:12.900
integral and indispensable role to be played by the state of israel

02:25:13.540 --> 02:25:18.180
And everyone who wants to see that iran come into being has to understand

02:25:19.460 --> 02:25:21.460
That it is inextricable

02:25:22.420 --> 02:25:24.980
From support for zionism

02:25:25.620 --> 02:25:27.620
Um

02:25:27.940 --> 02:25:30.740
Lastly uh speaking of that before the cherry on top

02:25:31.300 --> 02:25:37.300
Could you please tell because I know that you said it before I want to make sure that I got this because that's the one thing that I missed

02:25:37.700 --> 02:25:39.700
When I was talking about um

02:25:40.020 --> 02:25:42.020
Uh humab adin and the muslim brotherhood

02:25:42.340 --> 02:25:47.060
What was the connection between what was going on in the obama administration back then

02:25:47.620 --> 02:25:50.980
And obviously I think the biden administration is kind of a continuation of that

02:25:51.460 --> 02:25:59.060
And what we're seeing right now with these protests and getting rid of the um all references to islam within the counter terrorism manuals

02:26:00.900 --> 02:26:02.500
Well, I think I addressed it already

02:26:02.500 --> 02:26:08.260
I told you that from my years of working in the iranian opposition where we engaged in significant lobbying activities

02:26:08.660 --> 02:26:12.340
At one point I was even sitting with a member of the national security council

02:26:12.900 --> 02:26:18.180
But I can tell you that the democrats very clearly have a pro islamist agenda

02:26:18.660 --> 02:26:21.540
And they want to keep for example the islamic republican power in iran

02:26:22.420 --> 02:26:25.620
So so what do they get for it? What's stated in that direction?

02:26:26.100 --> 02:26:28.100
But what do they

02:26:28.100 --> 02:26:31.940
What do they obtain by taking that kind of position at the end of the day?

02:26:32.020 --> 02:26:34.900
What's their carrot at the end of the stake? Is it just money? Is it power?

02:26:36.100 --> 02:26:40.260
Money and power they they get financed and they get to win elections

02:26:40.660 --> 02:26:44.260
It's the same reason why they bring, you know millions of migrants into our country

02:26:44.420 --> 02:26:49.860
They're trying to demographically re-engineer our country so that they can stay in power staying in power means getting more money

02:26:50.340 --> 02:26:55.460
It's just a racket for these people. I mean they're corrupt. They use political office as a way to amass wealth

02:26:55.540 --> 02:26:56.420
That's all it is

02:26:56.420 --> 02:27:02.420
They're a mafia and they don't give a fuck about the future or our children's future, you know, that's all they are a bunch of looters

02:27:03.140 --> 02:27:08.740
Uh now to uh serrillion valley who's been super chatting all of this time

02:27:09.380 --> 02:27:11.380
Uh serrillion valley

02:27:12.020 --> 02:27:17.700
Now you said before that you are up to hearing a super chats here, but they do get a little bit spicy

02:27:18.180 --> 02:27:20.020
Towards you

02:27:20.020 --> 02:27:21.540
You know, uh

02:27:21.540 --> 02:27:27.300
I don't think that's a good note to end on I think that a better note to end on would be yet again for me to

02:27:28.340 --> 02:27:33.700
Direct people to the american colossus not just website american colossus.org

02:27:34.260 --> 02:27:38.500

Where I actually go back and revise

02:28:11.060 --> 02:28:14.500
Well, I wouldn't say I revise my thesis. I present an alternative

02:28:15.140 --> 02:28:17.700
Uh interpretation and hypothesis

02:28:18.180 --> 02:28:21.140
