00:00.000 --> 00:15.740
So, what I'm going to do in this course is discuss mostly ideas that are already in the

00:15.740 --> 00:24.600
book called The Emotion Machine, I'm sorry I used that title, and the older book called

00:24.600 --> 00:36.360
The Society of Mind, which are, the books are not quite the same, they overlap a bit

00:36.360 --> 00:43.680
in material, but they're sort of complementary, I like the old one better because the chapters

00:43.680 --> 00:51.760
are all one page long, and they're moderately independent, so if you don't like one you

00:51.760 --> 01:01.200
can skip it. The new book is much denser and has a smaller number of long chapters, and

01:01.200 --> 01:12.080
I think it's, over the years I got lots of reactions from young people in high school,

01:12.080 --> 01:20.840
for example, almost all of whom like The Society of Mind and found it easy to read and seemed

01:20.840 --> 01:30.560
to understand it, there are lots of criticisms by older people who maybe some of them found

01:30.560 --> 01:41.040
it harder to put so many fragments together, who knows, but most of this class, most of

01:41.040 --> 01:49.920
the things I'd like to say are in those books, so it's really like a big seminar and I'll,

01:49.920 --> 01:58.160
my hope is that everyone who comes to this class would have a couple of questions that

01:58.160 --> 02:06.040
they'd like to discuss, and if I can't answer them maybe some others if you can, so I'd

02:06.040 --> 02:13.120
like to think of this as a super seminar, and normally I don't prepare lectures, and

02:13.120 --> 02:18.880
I just start off asking if there are any questions, and if they're not I get really pissed off

02:19.440 --> 02:29.800
because, but anyway I'm going to start with a series of slides. So why do we need machines,

02:29.800 --> 02:45.880
and partly there are a lot of problems, unlike most species or kinds of animals, humans have

02:45.880 --> 02:55.000
only been around a few million years, and they're very clever compared to other animals,

02:55.000 --> 03:04.760
but it's not clear how long they will last, and when we go we might take all the others

03:04.760 --> 03:14.760
with us, so there are a whole set of serious problems that are arising because there are

03:14.800 --> 03:30.640
so many humans, and here's just a little list of things. There's a better list in a book

03:30.640 --> 03:46.760
by the astronomer royal Martin Lise of England, anybody know the title? Yes, our final hour,

03:46.760 --> 04:09.880
it's a slightly scary title, and when I was a teenager, World War II came to an end with

04:09.960 --> 04:27.720
the dropping of two atomic bombs on Japan, and I didn't believe the first one was real

04:27.720 --> 04:37.040
because it was in Hiroshima, so I assumed that the U.S. had somehow made a big underground

04:37.040 --> 04:46.200
underwater tanker with 20,000 tons of TNT and some few grams of radium or something and

04:46.200 --> 04:54.040
blown it up in the harbor, and first it flew an airplane over dropping some little thing,

04:54.040 --> 05:04.320
and this was to fool the Japanese into thinking that we have an atomic bomb, but when they

05:04.320 --> 05:17.800
did it again over Nagasaki that wasn't feasible, so, and when I was in grade school, sometimes

05:17.800 --> 05:25.680
if I said something very bright, I would hear a teacher saying, maybe he's another J. Robert

05:25.720 --> 05:36.240
Oppenheimer, because that was the name of a scientist who had been head of the Manhattan

05:36.240 --> 05:50.560
Project, and he was, I think, three or four years earlier in grade school than I was, and I thought

05:50.560 --> 05:56.400
it was very strange for a person to have a first name as just being a letter rather than a name,

05:56.400 --> 06:11.480
and many years later, when I was at Princeton in graduate school, I met the Robert Oppenheimer,

06:11.480 --> 06:20.280
and that was a great pleasure, and in fact he took me to lunch with a couple of other people I

06:20.320 --> 06:29.480
admired, namely Gertl and Einstein, which was very exciting, except I couldn't understand

06:29.480 --> 06:37.560
Einstein because I wasn't used to people with a strong German accent, but I understood Gertl

06:37.560 --> 06:46.000
just fine, and after that lunch was over, I went and spent about a year learning about Turing

06:46.000 --> 06:57.840
machines and trying to prove theorems about them and so forth. So anyway, in the course of these

06:57.840 --> 07:11.080
talks, we'll run across a few of these people, and here's a big list of the people that I'm mostly

07:11.080 --> 07:21.920
indebted to for the ideas in the Society of Mind and the Emotion Machine. The ones in blue are

07:21.920 --> 07:37.000
people I've actually met. It would be nice to have met Aristotle because no one really knows much

07:37.120 --> 07:47.800
about him, but you really should read, just skim through some of that and you'll find that this is a

07:47.800 --> 07:54.440
really smart guy. We don't know if he wrote this stuff or if it were compiled by his students,

07:54.440 --> 08:05.360
like a lot of Feynman's writing is, and von Neumann's writing is edited from notes by their

08:05.400 --> 08:17.160
students. Anyway, the astonishing thing about Aristotle is that he seems to be slightly more

08:17.160 --> 08:27.280
imaginative than most cognitive scientists you'll run into in the present day. It would have been

08:27.280 --> 08:43.040
nice to know Spinoza and Kant and the others. Also, Freud wrote 30 or 40 books, so did he fall off this

08:43.040 --> 08:54.760
list? There he is. I just made this list the other day and I was looking up these people to find their

08:55.440 --> 09:10.800
birthdays and stuff. Yes? Because they're religious, as far as I can see. Well, who would you, would you

09:10.800 --> 09:37.240
say Buddha? Name one. Maybe I never heard of them. Confucius. Well, I only know of them through

09:37.240 --> 09:58.440
aphorisms. Single Proverbs, but I don't know that Confucius had a theory of thinking. Well, I've

09:58.520 --> 10:10.480
looked at Buddhist theories and they're, I don't think they would get a C plus. And one problem is

10:10.480 --> 10:18.800
that there are cultures, there's something about Greek culture because it had science, it had

10:18.840 --> 10:33.160
experiments. Somebody has a theory and they say, and like Epimenides Lucretius, somewhere in the society

10:33.160 --> 10:43.200
of mind, I think I quoted Lucretius about translucent objects. And he says they have the

10:43.360 --> 10:49.600
particular appearance because the rays of light bounce many times before they get to the surface, so

10:49.600 --> 10:57.640
you can't tell where they started. And I don't find in Eastern philosophy theories that say, here's what

10:57.640 --> 11:08.240
I think and here's a reason why. I've looked at Buddhist stuff and it's strange lists of psychological

11:08.240 --> 11:16.520
principles, every one of which is looks pretty wrong. And they make nice two dimensional diagrams,

11:16.520 --> 11:22.400
but no evidence for any of them. So I don't know whether to take it seriously.

11:38.960 --> 11:40.560
Well, what can't be tested?

11:44.560 --> 11:49.840
Then why, if they can't be tested, why should one look at it twice?

11:58.960 --> 12:06.560
Okay, I think this is a serious argument. It seems to me that science began a little bit in China,

12:07.280 --> 12:19.120
a little bit in India. In the Arabic world, they got up to the middle of high school algebra. But then what?

12:21.000 --> 12:27.920
Well, but this wasn't as good as Archimedes, who got to the beginning of calculus. So if you look at most

12:27.920 --> 12:36.520
cultures, they never got to the critical point of getting theories, doing experiments, discussing them

12:37.040 --> 12:46.160
and then throwing them out. And so if you look at Buddhist philosophy, it's 2,500 years old.

12:48.040 --> 12:57.080
If you look at Greek physics, yes, Archimedes almost got calculus and he got lots of nice principles. And

12:57.080 --> 13:01.480
Buddha mentions, at some point, if you want to weigh an elephant,

13:05.160 --> 13:12.560
put him in a boat and then take the elephant out and put rocks in till the boat sinks at the same level. So there

13:12.560 --> 13:20.400
you see a good idea. But if you look at the history of the culture, if people still say this 1000 year old

13:20.400 --> 13:24.120
stuff is good, then you should say, no, it's not.

13:34.760 --> 13:35.280
Sure.

13:42.840 --> 13:48.320
No, the question is why did it stop? Why did it stop?

13:50.400 --> 13:58.440
Ancient wisdom is generally not very good. And we shouldn't respect it for too long. And that's

13:59.160 --> 14:18.160
no, everybody. No, we, we got rid of alchemy, we got rid of what do you call it? What's caloric?

14:19.440 --> 14:25.840
You, you use you jump off their shoulder. You don't stay on them.

14:29.280 --> 14:35.600
So it's good to know history. But if the history doesn't get anywhere, then you don't want to admire it too

14:35.600 --> 14:41.120
much because you have to ask, why did it stop when it went wrong? And usually went wrong because

14:41.120 --> 14:50.360
barbarians came in and, well, you know, it happened to Archimedes. Some, some Roman killed him. But

14:51.200 --> 15:02.160
anyway, no, it's, it's good. It's a good question. Why, why didn't science happen a million years ago?

15:02.160 --> 15:06.920
Because humans are five million years old. So what took it so long?

15:11.520 --> 15:18.480
No, it's more. Sure. Okay. Do you have a theory of why science didn't develop for

15:18.480 --> 15:27.680
so long? In most cultures, it might be religion, which is a sort of science that doesn't use

15:27.680 --> 15:34.360
evidence. And in fact, kills people who try to get it. And so they're, they're systematic reasons why

15:34.360 --> 15:41.720
most cultures failed. And maybe somebody has written, is there a book on why science disappeared,

15:42.680 --> 15:53.040
except once? It's rather remarkable, isn't it? After all, the idea, if somebody says something,

15:53.040 --> 15:59.640
and somebody else says, okay, let's do an experiment to see if that's right. You don't have to very,

15:59.640 --> 16:06.120
be very bright. So how come it didn't happen all the time everywhere? Period.

16:11.720 --> 16:18.040
He's speculating, even in Europe, there did happen, was it a fluke? And I think he gives the example of,

16:18.040 --> 16:25.640
suppose an asteroid or a common crash in Paris in, you know, family year, he gives me 1150 or 1200 or

16:25.640 --> 16:31.240
something. Then what? Whether it's with science that they never developed anywhere. He just sort of

16:31.240 --> 16:39.800
raised it himself as a thought problem. Well, history is called the flukes. I'm trying to remember who

16:39.840 --> 16:51.680
wrote that nice book about the plague. Some woman. And she mentions that this was spread by rats and

16:51.680 --> 17:02.960
fleas or something. And 30 or 40% of the population of many countries in Europe died. And the next

17:02.960 --> 17:26.680
generation had a lot of furniture. The standard of living went way up. So anyway, here's a list of

17:27.280 --> 17:45.480
disasters and Martin Reese is the Royal Astronomer and has that book about the last hour or whatever. And I'm

17:45.480 --> 17:58.200
making another longer list, but he has lots of obvious disasters like some high school student looks up the

17:59.520 --> 18:13.040
genetic sequence for smallpox virus has been published. And now you can write a list of nucleotides and send

18:13.040 --> 18:19.480
it somewhere. And they'll make it for about 50 cents or a dollar per nucleotide for so for a couple of

18:19.480 --> 18:27.400
hundred dollars, you can make a virus or a few hundred. And so one possibility is that some high school

18:27.400 --> 18:36.480
student makes some smallpox only gets it wrong and it kills everyone. So there are lots of lots of

18:36.520 --> 18:47.920
disasters like that. And no one knows what to do about that because the the DNA synthesis machinery is

18:47.920 --> 19:00.040
becoming less and less expensive and probably the average rich private high school could afford one. So

19:00.080 --> 19:10.960
there are lots of other things that could happen. But one particular one is this graph which I just made up.

19:14.680 --> 19:29.440
An interesting fact is that since 1950, when the first antibiotics started to appear, as I mentioned, I was a kid

19:29.440 --> 19:41.800
in the 1940s, and penicillin had just hit the stands. And there wasn't much of it. And there was a researcher

19:43.720 --> 19:55.400
lived a few blocks from us whose dog had cancer. And so its father, I don't know what you call the owner of a

19:55.400 --> 20:07.720
dog, sneaked some penicillin out of the lab and gave it to the dog who died anyway. But he said, Well, nobody's

20:07.720 --> 20:16.880
tried penicillin on cancer yet. Maybe it will work. And a lot of people were mad at him because he probably

20:16.880 --> 20:26.920
cost some human its life. But he said he might have saved a billion humans their lives. So ethics, ethicists are

20:26.920 --> 20:34.520
people who give reasons not to do things. And I'm not saying they're wrong. But it's a funny job.

20:37.880 --> 20:45.320
So anyway, since that sort of thing happened, and medicine began to advance, people have been living one year

20:45.320 --> 21:02.440
longer every 12. So it's 60 years since 1950. Another. So that's five of those six. So they're living six or seven

21:02.440 --> 21:14.200
years longer now than they were when I was born. And somebody mentioned that that curve stopped the last few years.

21:15.400 --> 21:27.800
For other reasons. But anyway, if you extrapolated that, you find that the lifespan is going to keep increasing.

21:29.320 --> 21:38.840
How much we don't know. Another problem is that you might discover enough about genetics to get rid of most of the

21:38.840 --> 21:49.480
serious diseases. Maybe just 20 or 30 genes are responsible for most deaths right now. And if you could fix those,

21:50.160 --> 21:56.920
which we can't do yet, there's no way to change a gene in a person. Because invading all the cells is pretty

21:57.880 --> 22:06.920
massive intervention. But we'll get around that. And then it might be that people suddenly start living 200 or 300

22:06.920 --> 22:18.120
years. No, at some point, the population has to slow down. And so you have, you can only reach equilibrium with one child per

22:18.120 --> 22:27.000
family, and probably less than that. And so all the work has to be done by two or 300 year olds. And let's hope they're good

22:27.000 --> 22:37.960
and healthy. So anyway, I think it's very important that we get smart robots, because we're going to have to stem the

22:37.960 --> 22:48.040
population. And I hope people will live longer and blah, blah, blah. And so these robots have to be smart enough to replace

22:48.040 --> 23:06.000
most people. And how do you make something smart? Well, artificial intelligence is the field whose goal has been to make

23:06.000 --> 23:19.840
machines that do things that we regard as smart or intelligent or whatever you want to call it. And the idea of seriously making

23:19.840 --> 23:35.680
machines smart has roots that go back to a few pioneers like Leibniz who wrote about automata and that sort of thing. But the idea of

23:35.680 --> 23:48.040
the general purpose computer didn't appear till the 1930s and 40s in some sense. The first form of the general purpose computer appears in

23:48.640 --> 24:04.400
really in the 1920s and 30s with the work of a mathematician who, Amel Post at NYU, who I happen to never meet. But we had some friends in

24:04.400 --> 24:19.880
common. And he had the idea of production rules and basically rule based systems and proved various theorems about them. Then Kurt Gertl showed

24:19.880 --> 24:31.560
that if you had something like a computer or a procedure that had the right kinds of rules, it could compute all sorts of things. But there were

24:31.560 --> 24:44.040
some things it couldn't compute, unsolvable problems. And that became an exciting branch of mathematics. And the star thinker in that field was

24:44.040 --> 24:56.800
Alan Turing, who invented a very simple kind of universal general purpose computer. Instead of random access memory, it just had a tape which it

24:56.800 --> 25:11.520
could write on and read and change symbols and would go back and forth. And if it's in state X at C symbol Y, it will print symbol Z over the

25:11.520 --> 25:32.560
X and move to the left or right. And just a bunch of rules like that were enough to make a universal computer. And so from about 1936, it was sort of clear to a large

25:32.560 --> 25:49.480
mathematical community that these were great things. And a couple of general purpose like computers, very simple ones, were built in the 1930s and more in the 1940s. And in the 1950s, big

25:49.480 --> 26:08.560
companies started to make big computers, which were rooms full of equipment. But as you know, most programs could only do some particular thing. And none of them were very smart.

26:09.560 --> 26:34.560
Whereas a human can handle lots of kinds of situations. And if you have one that that you've never seen before, there's a good chance you'll think of a new way to deal with that, and so forth. And so how do you make a machine that doesn't get stuck almost all the time?

26:34.560 --> 27:01.560
And I like to use the word resourcefulness, although I left an R out of that one. Is there a shorter word? So here's a good example.

27:04.560 --> 27:30.560
My favorite example of a situation where a person is born, or less, with a dozen different ways of dealing with something. And the problem that I imagined that you're dealing with is this. My favorite example is I'm thirsty.

27:31.560 --> 27:56.560
So I see that glass of water, and I do that and get it. Actually, I am. On the other hand, if I were here, I would never in a whole lifetime do this. You never walk out a window by mistake.

27:57.560 --> 28:16.560
We're incredibly reliable. So how do I know how far it is? And that slide shows you 12 different ways that your vision system, that's only your vision system, has to measure distances.

28:17.560 --> 28:45.560
So gradients, if things are sort of blurry, then they must be pretty far away. That's sort of a foggy day outside. Here's a situation. If you assume those are both chairs of the same size, and you know that this chair is about twice as far away as that, although you don't well,

28:45.560 --> 28:54.560
and you know how far away they are pretty much by the absolute size.

28:54.560 --> 29:12.560
If you have two eyes that work well, then if something is less than 30 feet away, you can make a pretty good estimate of its distance by focusing both eyes on some feature, and your brain can tell how far apart your eyes are looking.

29:12.560 --> 29:28.560
So there's 12 different things. It's more than you need. Lots of people are missing half of those. Lots of people have very poor vision in one eye.

29:29.560 --> 29:48.560
Some people cannot fuse stereo images, even though both eyes have 20-20 vision, and in some cases, nobody knows why they can't do that.

29:49.560 --> 30:06.560
I think I once took a test for being a pilot, and they wanted to be sure you could do stereo vision, which seemed very strange, because if you're an airplane and you're less than 30 or 40 feet away from something, it's too...

30:07.560 --> 30:15.560
Then yes, you can't use stereo, you could use stereo, but it's too late.

30:15.560 --> 30:37.560
So anyway, that's interesting. See if you can think of an example where a person has even more 12 of these, but it's pretty amazing, isn't it? That's more redundancy.

30:38.560 --> 30:56.560
This is too hard to read, but somehow I found in an Aristotle essay the idea that you should represent things in multiple ways.

30:57.560 --> 31:19.560
One person might describe a house as a shelter against destruction by wind, rain, and heat. Another might describe it as a construction of stones, bricks, and timbers, but a third possible description would say it was in that form, in that material, with that purpose.

31:19.560 --> 31:47.560
So you see there's two different descriptions. One is the functional description. It's a shelter. The second one is a structural description of how it's made, and Aristotle says which is the better description, and he dismisses the material one or the functional one is not rather the person who combines both in a single statement.

31:50.560 --> 32:08.560
And then I found a paragraph by Feynman who says every theoretical physicist who is any good knows six or seven different ways to represent exactly the same physics, and you know that they're all equivalent,

32:09.560 --> 32:20.560
but you keep them all in your head hoping that they will give you different ideas for guessing. I should put more dots.

32:20.560 --> 32:44.560
Anyway, that whole argument is to say that the interesting thing about people is that they have so many ways to do things and perceive things and think of things.

32:45.560 --> 32:59.560
And in some cases we even know that there are different parts of the brain that are involved in one aspect or another of constructing those different representations or descriptions.

32:59.560 --> 33:26.560
If you look at the, one of my favorite books weighs about 20 pounds. It's the book on the nervous system by Candle and Schwartz, and the index to that book is quite a lot of pages long, and it mentions 400 different structures in the brain.

33:29.560 --> 33:50.560
So the brain is not like the, well, I shouldn't make fun of the liver, because for all I know, the liver has 400 different mini processes for doing things, but the brain has distinguishable areas that seem to perform several hundred different functions,

33:50.560 --> 34:08.560
and with a microscope, at first they all look pretty much the same, but if you look closely you see different, slightly different patterns of how the most layers of the cortex of the brain, most parts of it have six layers,

34:09.560 --> 34:34.560
and each has a population of different kinds of cells. There are a lot of cross connections up and down, and sideways to other, there are engine columns of between 400 and 1,000 cells, and you have a couple of million of those, and there are lots of differences between the columns in different areas, and we know some of the functions.

34:35.560 --> 35:01.560
Most cases we don't know much about how any of them actually work, with the main exception of vision, where the functions of the cells in the visual cortex are fairly well understood at low levels, so we know how that part of the brain finds the edges and boundaries of different areas and textures and regions of the visual field.

35:02.560 --> 35:20.560
But we do not know even a little bit about how the brain recognizes something as a chair and an overhead projector and CRT screen, and that sort of thing.

35:21.560 --> 35:47.560
So, the kind of question that I got interested in was, how can you have a system which has a very large number of different kinds of computers, each of which by itself might be relatively simple or might not, I suppose,

35:48.560 --> 36:08.560
and how could you put them together into a larger system which could do things like learn language and prove theorems and convince people to do things that they would never have dreamed of doing five minutes earlier and stuff like that.

36:09.560 --> 36:37.560
Now, the first sort of things I was interested in was, in fact, how to make, how to simulate simple kinds of nerve cells, because in the 1950s, there was about almost 100 years, really more like 50 years,

36:37.560 --> 36:50.560
of science discovering things about neurons and nerve cells, the axons and dendrites that they used to communicate with other neurons.

36:50.560 --> 37:07.560
So, if you go back to 1890, you find a few anatomists discovering some of the functions of, or connections of neurons in the brain, and you find a few experimental physicists.

37:07.560 --> 37:32.560
There was no oscilloscope yet, but there were very high-yane galvanometers which could detect pulses going along a nerve fiber, and by 1900, it was pretty clear that part of the activity in a nerve cell was chemical,

37:32.560 --> 37:52.560
and part was electrical, and by 1920 or 1930, with the cathode ray tube appearing mostly because of television, but it became possible to do a lot of neurophysiology by sticking needles in brains.

37:53.560 --> 38:08.560
The vacuum tube appears around 1900, and you can make amplifiers that can see millivolts and then microvolts, so in the beginning of the 20th century, there was lots of progress.

38:08.560 --> 38:20.560
By 1950, we knew a lot about the nervous system, but we still don't know much about how you learn something in the brain.

38:21.560 --> 38:34.560
It's quite clear that the things called synapses are involved, connections between two neurons become better at conducting nerve impulses under some conditions.

38:35.560 --> 38:53.560
But no one knows how higher-level knowledge is represented in the brain yet, and the Society of Mind Book had a lot of theories about that, and in particular, there was a theory called K-Lines,

38:54.560 --> 39:21.560
K-Lines, knowledge lines or something, that came partly from me and partly from a couple of other researchers named David Walts and Jordan Pollack, and that's a sort of nice theory of how neural networks might remember higher-level concepts.

39:22.560 --> 39:32.560
And for some reason, although that kind of work is from around 1980, which is 30 years ago, it has not hit the neuroscience community.

39:33.560 --> 39:58.560
So if you look at the Emotion Machine Book or the Society of Mind, in Amazon, you might run across a review by a neurologist named Richard Restak, who says that Minsky makes up a lot of concepts like K-Lines and micro-neems and stuff like that that nobody's ever heard of, and there's no evidence for them,

39:58.560 --> 40:15.560
and he ignores the possibility that it isn't the nerve cells in the brain that are important, but the supporting tissues called glia, which hold the neurons up and feed them, and he goes on for a couple of insane paragraphs.

40:16.560 --> 40:41.560
It's very interesting because it doesn't occur to him that you can't look for something until you have the idea of it, and so here's this 30-year-old idea of K-Lines, and go and ask your favorite neuroscientist what it is, and he said,

40:41.560 --> 40:45.560
oh, I think that's some AI thing, but where's the evidence for it?

40:48.560 --> 40:50.560
What do you suppose is my reaction to that?

40:53.560 --> 40:55.560
Who's supposed to get the evidence?

40:58.560 --> 41:07.560
So it seems to me that there's a strange field in neuroscience, which is that it doesn't want new ideas unless you've proved them.

41:08.560 --> 41:17.560
So I try to have conversations with them, but get somewhat tired of it.

41:18.560 --> 41:29.560
Anyway, but in this course, I'm taking the opposite approach, which is that we don't want a theory of thinking.

41:30.560 --> 41:37.560
We want a lot of them because probably psychology is not like physics.

41:38.560 --> 41:40.560
What's the most wonderful thing about physics?

41:41.560 --> 41:49.560
The most wonderful thing is that they have unified theories.

41:50.560 --> 41:58.560
There wasn't much of a unified theory until Newton, and he got these three laws.

41:59.560 --> 42:00.560
Wonderful laws.

42:04.560 --> 42:14.560
One was the gravitational idea that things, bodies attract each other with a force that's the inverse square of the distance between them.

42:15.560 --> 42:20.560
Another is that kinetic energy is conserved.

42:23.560 --> 42:27.560
Equal reaction is equal and opposite.

42:28.560 --> 42:34.560
If two things collide, they transfer equal amount of momentum to both.

42:35.560 --> 42:38.560
There was a little problem up to Newton's time.

42:39.560 --> 42:41.560
Galileo got some of those ideas.

42:42.560 --> 42:50.560
My impression from reading him is that he has a dim idea that there are two things around.

42:51.560 --> 43:01.560
There's kinetic energy, which is mv, and there's momentum is mv, and there's kinetic energy, which is mv squared.

43:03.560 --> 43:09.560
He doesn't have the clear idea that there are two different things here, and you can't blame him.

43:11.560 --> 43:22.560
You wouldn't think that two quantities would combine in two different ways to make two important different concepts.

43:23.560 --> 43:32.560
Well, that got clear to Newton somehow, and Galileo is a bit muddled, although he gets almost all the consequences of those things right.

43:33.560 --> 43:38.560
But he doesn't get the orbits and things to come out.

43:42.560 --> 43:51.560
Anyway, what happened in artificial intelligence, like most fields, is that people said,

43:52.560 --> 43:57.560
well, let's try to understand thinking and psychology, and let's use physics as our model.

43:58.560 --> 44:09.560
And so what we want is to get a very small number of universal laws, and a lot of psychologists struggled around to do that.

44:09.560 --> 44:17.560
And then they gradually separated so that there were some psychologists, like Bill Estes,

44:18.560 --> 44:25.560
who worked out some very nice mathematical rules for reinforcement-based learning.

44:26.560 --> 44:35.560
Got a simple rule, if you designed an experiment right, it predicted pretty well how many trials it would take,

44:35.560 --> 44:46.560
a rat or a pigeon or a dog or whatever, to learn a certain thing from trial and error.

44:47.560 --> 44:52.560
And Estes got a set of four or five rules, which looked like Newton's laws.

44:53.560 --> 44:59.560
And if you designed your experiment very carefully and shielded the animal from noise and everything else,

44:59.560 --> 45:15.560
which is what a physicist would do for a physics experiment, the reinforcement theories got some pretty good models of how to make a machine learn.

45:16.560 --> 45:18.560
But they weren't good enough.

45:19.560 --> 45:31.560
So here's a whole list of things that happened in the early years of cognitive psychology,

45:32.560 --> 45:37.560
when people were trying to make theories of thinking, and they were imitating the physicists.

45:38.560 --> 45:55.560
By physics envy to borrow a term of Freud, the idea is, can you find a few simple rules that will apply to very broad classes of psychological phenomena?

45:56.560 --> 46:01.560
And this led to various kinds of projects.

46:05.560 --> 46:18.560
Lots of neural network and reinforcement and statistical-based methods led to learning machines that were pretty good at learning in some kinds of situations.

46:19.560 --> 46:32.560
And they're becoming very popular, but I don't like them because if you have a lot of variables, like 50 or 100,

46:33.560 --> 46:41.560
then to use a probabilistic analysis, you have to think of all combinations of those variables.

46:42.560 --> 46:54.560
Because if two of them are combined in something like an exclusive or a manner, I just put the light pen in a pocket.

46:55.560 --> 47:01.560
It's either in a left pocket or a right pocket. Can't be both. That's an XOR.

47:02.560 --> 47:17.560
That will cause a lot of trouble through a learning machine, and if there are 100 variables, there's no way you could decide which of the two to the 100th Boolean combinations of those variables you should think about.

47:18.560 --> 47:36.560
And so lots of statistical learning systems are good for lots of applications, but they just won't cut it to solve hard problems where the hypothesis is a little bit complicated and has seven or eight variables with complicated interactions.

47:37.560 --> 47:52.560
So most statistical learning people assume that if you get a lot of partial ones, then you can look for combinations of ones that have high correlations with the result.

47:53.560 --> 47:57.560
Then you can start combining them and things get better and better.

47:58.560 --> 48:11.560
However, if mathematically, if in effect you're looking for, it depends on the exclusive or of several variables, there's no way to approach that by successive approximations.

48:11.560 --> 48:19.560
If any one of the variables is missing, there won't be any correlation of the phenomenon with the others.

48:19.560 --> 48:32.560
Anyway, that's a long story, but I think it's worth complaining about because almost all young people who start working on artificial intelligence look around and say, what's popular?

48:33.560 --> 48:42.560
Statistical learning. So I'll do that. That's exactly the way to kill yourself scientifically.

48:43.560 --> 48:55.560
You don't want to get the most popular thing. You want to see what am I really good at that's different and what are the chances that that would provide another thing.

48:55.560 --> 49:00.560
So you end of long speech.

49:01.560 --> 49:25.560
Another problem in the last 30 years, and I'm sort of, as you'll see during my lectures, I think a lot of wonderful things happened between 1950 when the idea of AI first got articulated in the 1950s.

49:25.560 --> 49:41.560
And then the 20 years after that from 1960 to 1980, a lot of early experiments, and I'll show you some of them, looked very promising.

49:41.560 --> 49:49.560
In fact, they may be, here we go.

49:49.560 --> 50:15.560
1961. Jim Slagle was a young graduate student here at MIT.

50:16.560 --> 50:37.560
He was blind. He had gotten some retinal degeneration thing in his first or second year of high school. He was told that he would lose all his vision and there was no treatment or hope.

50:38.560 --> 50:47.560
So he learned Braille while he could still see. And when he got to MIT, he was completely blind.

50:47.560 --> 51:03.560
But there was a nice big parking lot in Technology Square, and he would ride a bicycle and people like Sussman and Winston and whoever was around would yell at him,

51:03.560 --> 51:16.560
telling him where the next obstacle would be, and Jim got better and better at that, and nothing would stop him.

51:16.560 --> 51:24.560
And he decided he would write a program that, oh, I wrote a program that would take any formula and find its derivative.

51:25.560 --> 51:28.560
It was really easy because there are just about five rules.

51:28.560 --> 51:39.560
Like if there's a product UV, then you compute U times the derivative of V plus V times, you know, U, T, V plus V, D, U.

51:39.560 --> 51:46.560
So I wrote a 20-line list program that did all the algebraic expressions.

51:46.560 --> 51:55.560
And what it would do is put D's in and then in the right place, and then it would go back through the expression again.

51:55.560 --> 52:02.560
Wherever it saw a D, it would do the derivative of the thing after that, and nothing to it.

52:02.560 --> 52:12.560
So Slagle said, well, I'll do integrals. And we all said, well, that's very hard. Nobody knows how to do it.

52:13.560 --> 52:27.560
And in fact, in Providence at the home of the American Mathematical Society, there is a big library called the Bateman Manuscript Project,

52:27.560 --> 52:32.560
which has been collecting all known integrals for 100 years.

52:32.560 --> 52:39.560
And when anybody finds a new integral that they can integrate in closed form,

52:39.560 --> 52:50.560
they send the formulas to the Bateman Manuscript Project, and some hackers there have developed ways to index it.

52:50.560 --> 52:58.560
So if you had an integral and you didn't know how to integrate it, you could look it up.

52:58.560 --> 53:01.560
And that was pretty big.

53:02.560 --> 53:20.560
I should say that Slagle succeeded in writing a program that managed to do all of the kinds of integrals that one usually found on the first year calculus course at MIT,

53:20.560 --> 53:27.560
and got an A in those, couldn't do word problems.

53:27.560 --> 53:38.560
And the uncanny thing is that if it was a problem that usually took an MIT student five or 10 minutes, Slagle's program would take five or 10 minutes.

53:38.560 --> 53:45.560
It's running on a IBM 701 with 20 millisecond cycle time.

53:45.560 --> 53:48.560
It's incredibly slow.

53:48.560 --> 53:54.560
You can type almost that fast.

53:54.560 --> 54:00.560
And 16K of words of memory.

54:00.560 --> 54:05.560
So there's no significance whatever to this accident of time.

54:05.560 --> 54:18.560
It would now take a microsecond or so, be a thousand million times faster than a student.

54:18.560 --> 54:20.560
Quite remarkable.

54:20.560 --> 54:22.560
I don't have a slide.

54:22.560 --> 54:26.560
Joel Moses then, Slagle went and graduated.

54:26.560 --> 54:34.560
Joel Moses was another student who was, is he a provost now or what?

54:34.560 --> 54:36.560
What?

54:36.560 --> 54:39.560
He got tired of it.

54:39.560 --> 54:48.560
A terrific student, and he set up a project called Maxima for Project Max Symbolic, something or algebra.

54:49.560 --> 54:56.560
And got people, several people all over the country, working on integration.

54:56.560 --> 55:07.560
And at some point, a couple of them, Bobby Kavanis and forget the other one, found a procedure that could in fact integrate everything,

55:07.560 --> 55:12.560
every algebraic expression that has a, can be integrated in closed form.

55:12.560 --> 55:15.560
I forget the couple of constraints on it.

55:15.560 --> 55:20.560
And that became a widely used system.

55:20.560 --> 55:26.560
It ultimately got replaced by Stephen Wolfram's Mathematica.

55:26.560 --> 55:33.560
But Maxima was sort of the world class symbolic mathematician for quite a few years.

55:33.560 --> 55:45.560
And Moses mentioned to me, he had read Slagle's program thesis.

55:45.560 --> 55:54.560
And it took him a couple of weeks to understand the two pages of, or three pages of Lisp that Slagle had written.

55:54.560 --> 56:11.560
Because being blind, Slagle had tried to get the thing into as compact a form as possible.

56:11.560 --> 56:14.560
But that's symbolic.

56:14.560 --> 56:17.560
It's too easy.

56:17.560 --> 56:21.560
It wasn't a more ambitious one, which was three years later.

56:21.560 --> 56:28.560
Dan Bobrow, who is now a vice president doing something at Xerox.

56:28.560 --> 56:31.560
And it solved problems like this.

56:31.560 --> 56:35.560
The gas consumption of my car is 15 miles per gallon.

56:35.560 --> 56:40.560
The distance between Boston and New York is 250 miles.

56:40.560 --> 56:46.560
What is the number of gallons used on a trip between Boston and New York?

56:46.560 --> 56:51.560
And it chomps away and solves that.

56:51.560 --> 56:54.560
It has about 100 rules.

56:54.560 --> 56:58.560
It doesn't really know what any of those words mean.

56:58.560 --> 57:05.560
But it thinks that the word is is equals.

57:05.560 --> 57:09.560
The distance between doesn't care what Boston and New York is.

57:09.560 --> 57:15.560
It has a format thing, which says the distance between two things.

57:15.560 --> 57:24.560
And it never bothers to, you see, because the phrase Boston and New York occurs twice in the example.

57:24.560 --> 57:28.560
It just replaces that by some symbol.

57:28.560 --> 57:30.560
It was fairly remarkable.

57:30.560 --> 57:37.560
And generally, if you had an algebra problem and you told it to Bobrow,

57:37.560 --> 57:40.560
Bobrow could type something in and it would solve it.

57:40.560 --> 57:44.560
If you typed it in, it probably wouldn't.

57:44.560 --> 57:49.560
But it was, you know, it had more than half a chance or less, about half a chance.

57:49.560 --> 57:51.560
So it was pretty good.

57:51.560 --> 58:01.560
And if you look at an out-of-print book, I compiled called Semantic Information Processing.

58:01.560 --> 58:04.560
Most of Bobrow's program is in that.

58:04.560 --> 58:08.560
So that's 1964.

58:08.560 --> 58:13.560
I'll skip Winograd, which is perhaps the most interesting program.

58:13.560 --> 58:22.560
This was a program where you could talk to a robot that...

58:22.560 --> 58:25.560
I don't have a good picture on the slide.

58:25.560 --> 58:28.560
But there are a bunch of blocks of different colors.

58:28.560 --> 58:32.560
They're all cubes in the rectangular blocks.

58:32.560 --> 58:40.560
And you can say, which is the largest block on top of the big blue block?

58:40.560 --> 58:42.560
And it would answer you.

58:42.560 --> 58:50.560
And you could say, put the large red block on top of the small green block.

58:50.560 --> 58:52.560
And it would do that.

58:52.560 --> 58:59.560
And Winograd's program was, of course, a symbolic one.

58:59.560 --> 59:07.560
We actually built a robot, and I guess we built it second.

59:07.560 --> 59:15.560
Our friends at Stanford built a robot, and they imported Winograd's program.

59:15.560 --> 59:24.560
And they had the robot actually performing these operations that you told it to do by typing.

59:24.560 --> 59:28.560
And it was pretty exciting.

59:28.560 --> 59:38.560
My favorite program in that period was this one, because it's so psychological.

59:38.560 --> 59:44.560
This is called a geometrical analogy test, and it's on some IQ tests.

59:44.560 --> 59:50.560
A is to be as C is to which of the following five.

59:51.560 --> 01:00:01.560
And Evans wrote a set of rules, which were pretty good at this.

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:07.560
It did as well as 16-year-olds, and it picks this one.

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:18.560
And if you ask it why, it says something like...

01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:21.560
I don't have a reason that...

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:25.560
It moves the largest object down or something like that.

01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:29.560
It makes up different reasons, but...

01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:34.560
So, you see, in some sense, we're going backwards in age,

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:43.560
because we're going from calculus to algebra to simple analogies.

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:47.560
Oh, there it is.

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:51.560
That's one where the largest object moves down.

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:59.560
I don't know why I have two of them.

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:02.560
These are for another lecture.

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:13.560
Okay.

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:19.560
So that was a period in which we picked problems that people considered hard,

01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:22.560
because they were mathematical.

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:30.560
But when you think about it more, you see, well, those math things are just procedures,

01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:39.560
and once you know what Laplace and Gauss and those mathematicians Newton and people did,

01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:44.560
you can write down systematic procedures for integrating

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:52.560
or for solving simultaneous algebraic constraint equations or things like that.

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:54.560
And so there's very little to it.

01:01:54.560 --> 01:02:02.560
So in some sense, if you look at what you're doing in math in high school, in education,

01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:05.560
you're going from hard to easy.

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:07.560
It's just that people aren't...

01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:13.560
Most people aren't very good at obeying really simple rules,

01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:19.560
because it's so hideously boring or something.

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:26.560
So we gradually started to ask, well, why can't we make machines understand everyday things

01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:32.560
and the things that everyone regards as common sense,

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:37.560
and people can do so you don't need machines to do them?

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:46.560
One of my favorite examples is, why can you pull something with a string but not push?

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:55.560
And there's been a lot of publicity recently about that interesting program

01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:59.560
that I've written a group at IBM called Watson,

01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:15.560
which is good at finding facts about sports people and celebrities and politics and so forth.

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:22.560
But there's no way it could understand why you could pull something with a string but not push.

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:29.560
And I don't know of any program that has that concept or way of dealing with it.

01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:33.560
So that's what I got interested in.

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:42.560
And starting around maybe the middle 1970s or late 1970s,

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:49.560
several of us started to stop doing the easy stuff

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:59.560
and try to make theories of how you would do the kinds of things that people are uniquely good at.

01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:03.560
I don't know of animals.

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:05.560
Well, I don't know.

01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:09.560
I'm sure a monkey wouldn't try to push anything with a string.

01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:19.560
Maybe it does it very quickly and you don't notice.

01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:33.560
And one aspect of common sense thinking is going right back to that idea of vision having a dozen different systems.

01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:37.560
What I think is that whatever a person normally is doing,

01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:42.560
they are probably representing it in several different ways.

01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:52.560
And here's an actual scene of two kids named Julie and Henry who are playing with blocks.

01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:56.560
It's pretty hard to see those blocks.

01:04:56.560 --> 01:05:05.560
And you can think that Julie is thinking seven thoughts.

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:12.560
I'd like to see a longer list, maybe a good essay would be to take a few examples and say,

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:16.560
what are the most common micro worlds?

01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:26.560
See physical, social, emotional, mental, instrumental, whatever that is, visual, tactile, spatial.

01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:30.560
She's thinking all these things. What if I pulled out that bottom block?

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:33.560
You can't see the tower very well.

01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:37.560
Should I help him or knock his tower down?

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:39.560
How would he react?

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:42.560
I forgot where I left the arch shaped block.

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:45.560
That was real.

01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:48.560
It's somewhere over here.

01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:52.560
But I don't think maybe it's that.

01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:55.560
I don't know.

01:05:55.560 --> 01:06:03.560
I remember when it happened, she mentioned that she reached around and it wasn't where she thought it was.

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:09.560
So common sense thinking involves this.

01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:12.560
In most cases, I think several representations.

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:28.560
I don't know if it's as many as seven or maybe 20 or what, but that's the kind of thing we want to know how to do.

01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:31.560
Okay, I think I'll stop and we'll discuss things.

01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:43.560
But in the next lecture, I'll talk about a model of how I think thinking works.

01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:49.560
What's the difference between us and our ancestors?

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:52.560
We know we have a larger brain.

01:06:52.560 --> 01:07:02.560
But if you think about it, if you took the brain that you already had in say,

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:09.560
I remember the name of the little monkey that looks like a squirrel, jumps around in trees.

01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:12.560
Anybody know it?

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:13.560
What?

01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:15.560
Maybe.

01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:19.560
It's a squirrel like thing.

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:23.560
I didn't know it was a monkey till you took a close look.

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:24.560
Maybe.

01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:25.560
Lemur?

01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:30.560
I don't, I forget.

01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:40.560
Anyway, if you just made the brain bigger, then the poor animal would be slower and heavier and would need more food and take longer to reproduce.

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:44.560
The joke about difficulty to give birth.

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:48.560
I don't know if any animal has the problem that humans have.

01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:53.560
A lot of people die.

01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:56.560
And so on.

01:07:56.560 --> 01:08:03.560
So how did we evolve new ways to think and so forth?

01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:29.560
And my first book, The Society of Mind, had this theory that maybe we evolved in a series of higher and higher levels or management structures built on the earlier ones.

01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:41.560
And this particular picture suggests that I got this idea from Sigmund Freud's early theories.

01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:45.560
There's been a lot of Freud bashing recently.

01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:47.560
You can look on the web.

01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:52.560
I forget the authors, but there are a couple of books saying that he made up all his data.

01:08:52.560 --> 01:09:09.560
And there's no evidence that he ever cured anyone and that he lied about all the data mentioned in his 30 or 40 books and so forth.

01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:12.560
Yes, right.

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:30.560
But the funny part is that if you look at his first major book, 1895, called The Interpretation of Dreams, it sort of outlines this theory that most of thinking is unconscious and it's processes you can't get access to.

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:37.560
And it has a little bit about sex, but that's not a major feature.

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:49.560
And it's just full of great ideas that the cognitive psychologists finally began to get in the 1960s again and never give credit to Freud.

01:09:49.560 --> 01:10:04.560
So he may well have made up his data, but if you have a very good theory and nobody will listen to you, what can you do?

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:09.560
His friend Rudolf Fleece listened to him.

01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:32.560
And there was another paper on how the neurons might be involved in thinking, which was also written around 1895, but never got published till 1950 by, forget who, called Project for a Scientific Psychology.

01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:38.560
And it's full of ideas that if they had been published, might have changed everything.

01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:50.560
Because anyway, what's on your mind?

01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:52.560
What would you like to hear about?

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:58.560
Who has another theory?

01:10:58.560 --> 01:10:59.560
Great.

01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:08.560
So earlier you talked a little bit about how we don't really see the neuroscience, all the things like K-Lines, etc.

01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:17.560
Do you think it's because they're just really hard to find or no one's actually looking for them?

01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:31.560
S. Dex Review says he uses vague ill-defined terms like K-Line and Microneme and a couple of others, and Frame and so forth.

01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:38.560
They're very well-defined.

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:45.560
When he talks about neurotransmitters, it's as though he thinks that chemical has some real significance.

01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:54.560
Any chemical would have the same function as any other one, provided there's another receptor that causes something to happen in the cell membrane.

01:11:54.560 --> 01:12:03.560
So you don't want to regard acetylcholine or epinephrine as having mental significance.

01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:08.560
It's just another pulse, but very low resolution.

01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:24.560
And yes, a neurochemical might affect all the neurons a little bit and raise the average amount of activity of some big population of cells and reduce the average activity of some others.

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:26.560
But that's nothing like thinking.

01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:35.560
That's like saying, in order to understand how a car works, what's the most insulting thing I could say?

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:50.560
Or to understand how a computer works, you have to understand the arsenic and phosphorus and or what's the other one?

01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:54.560
You have to understand these atoms that are, what?

01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:57.560
Well, that's the matrix.

01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:05.560
So there are these one part in a million impurities, and that's what's important about a computer, isn't it?

01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:09.560
The fact that the transistor has gain and so forth.

01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:11.560
Well, no.

01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:14.560
The trouble with the computer is the transistors.

01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:34.560
That's why practically every transistor in the computer is mated to another one in opposite phase to form a flip-flop whose properties are exactly the same except one in a quadrillion times.

01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:40.560
In other words, everything chemical about a computer is irrelevant.

01:13:40.560 --> 01:14:02.560
And I suspect that almost everything chemical about the brain is unimportant except that it causes, it helps to make the columns in the cortex which are complicated arrangements of several hundred cells work reliably.

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:09.560
Whereas the neuroscientist is looking for the secret in the sodium.

01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:16.560
When a neuron fires, the important thing is that that lets the sodium in and the potassium out or vice versa.

01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:18.560
I forget which.

01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:20.560
At 500 millivolts.

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:23.560
Really quite a colossal event.

01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:25.560
But it has no significant.

01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:41.560
It's only when it's attached to a flip-flop or to something like a K line which has an encoder and decoder of a digital sort every few microns of its length that you get something functional.

01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:50.560
So the trouble is the poor neuroscientist started out with too much knowledge about the wrong thing.

01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:59.560
The chemistry of the neuron firing is very interesting and complicated and cute.

01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:05.560
And in the case of the electric eel, you know what happened there.

01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:19.560
The neuron synapse, it got rid of the next neuron and it just, in the electric eel, you have a bunch of synapses or motor end plates, they're called, in series.

01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:24.560
So instead of half a volt, if you have 300 of those, you get 150 volts.

01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:30.560
I think the electric shock that an electric eel can give you is about 300 volts.

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:40.560
And this can cause you to drown promptly if you are in the wrong way when it happens to bump into you.

01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:44.560
I don't know why I'm rambling this way.

01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:50.560
You're welcome to study neuroscience, but please try to help them instead of learn from them.

01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:57.560
And they just don't know what a K line is.

01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:04.560
And that's a paper that's been widely read, published in 1980, and RESTAC says, ill-defined.

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:08.560
And I guess he couldn't understand it.

01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:11.560
Yeah, yeah.

01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:18.560
Why instead of trying to make the neuroscientists, like trying to find this in the human mind,

01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:28.560
why don't we just, like, as computer scientists, program, like, the K lines and try to prove that all this is the human mind and the claim of the producer?

01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:36.560
Like, why is that not widely spread into the computer scientist field?

01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:41.560
Well, I'm surprised how little has been done.

01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:45.560
Mike Travers has a thesis, Tony Hearn.

01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:49.560
There are three master's theses on K lines.

01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:53.560
They sort of got them to work to solve some simple problems.

01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:58.560
But I'd go further.

01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:07.560
I've never met a neuroscientist who knows the pioneering work of Newell and Simon in the late 1950s.

01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:11.560
So there's something wrong with that community.

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:14.560
They're just ignorant.

01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:17.560
They're proud of it.

01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:20.560
Oh, well.

01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:26.560
I spent some time learning neuroscience when I was...

01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:30.560
I once had a great stroke of luck when I was a...

01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:36.560
I guess I was a junior at Harvard and there was a great new biology building that was just constructed.

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:40.560
You probably know it's a great big thing with two rhinoceroses.

01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:45.560
What are those two huge animals?

01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:55.560
So this building was just finished and half occupied because it was made with the future.

01:17:55.560 --> 01:18:01.560
So I wandered over there and I met a professor named John Welsh.

01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:05.560
And I said, I'd like to learn neurology.

01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:10.560
And he said, great, well, I have an extra lab.

01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:15.560
Why don't you study the crayfish claw?

01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:17.560
And I said, great.

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:22.560
So he gave me this lab, which had four rooms and a dark room.

01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:29.560
And a lot of equipment and nobody there.

01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:32.560
And he had worked on crayfish.

01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:41.560
So there was somebody who went every week up to Walden Ponder somewhere and caught crayfish and bringing them back.

01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:44.560
And I was a radio amateur hacker at the time.

01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:46.560
So I was good at electronics.

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:51.560
So I got my crayfish and Welsh showed me how to.

01:18:51.560 --> 01:19:00.560
The great thing about this preparation is you can take the crayfish and if you claw and if you hold it just right, go snap.

01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:03.560
It comes off, grows another one.

01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:07.560
It takes a couple of years.

01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:11.560
And then there's this white thing hanging out, which is the nerve.

01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:17.560
And it turns out it's six nerves, one big one and a few little ones.

01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:24.560
And if you keep it in ringer solution, whatever that is, it can live for several days.

01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:36.560
So I got a lot of switches and little inductors and things and made a gadget and mounted this thing with six wires going to these nerves.

01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:49.560
And then I programmed it to reach down and pick up a pencil like that and wave it around.

01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:52.560
Well, that's obviously completely trivial.

01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:57.560
And all the neuroscientists came around and gasped and said, that's incredible.

01:19:57.560 --> 01:20:05.560
How did you do that?

01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:11.560
They had never thought of putting the thing back together and making it work.

01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:31.560
Anyway, it was, I always reminding myself that I'm the luckiest person in the world because every time I wanted to do something, I just happened to find the right person.

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:38.560
And they'd give me a lab.

01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:49.560
I got an idea for a microscope and there was this great professor, Purcell, who got the Nobel Prize after a while.

01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:52.560
And he said, that sounds like it would work.

01:20:52.560 --> 01:21:00.560
Why don't you take this lab?

01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:07.560
It was in the Jefferson.

01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:12.560
Anyway, yeah.

01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:19.560
Part of the reason that you don't see experimental neuroscience on things like K-lines is that neurons are long and thin.

01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:28.560
So if you want to do an experiment to actually measure a real neural network, you have to trace structures with roughly maybe tens of nanometer resolution.

01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:34.560
But you need to trace them over what might be a couple or even tens of millimeters to charge a week.

01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:41.560
And you need to do this for thousands and thousands of neurons before you could get to the point of seeing something like a K-line and understanding it.

01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:45.560
So it's just a massive data acquisition and processing problem.

01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:46.560
But they're doing that.

01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:47.560
They're trying to try to.

01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:51.560
But they don't know what to look for.

01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:54.560
Maybe you don't have to do so much.

01:21:54.560 --> 01:22:01.560
Maybe you just have to do a few sections here and there and say, well, look, there were 400 of these here.

01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:03.560
Now there's only 200.

01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:06.560
It looks like this is the same kind.

01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:08.560
Maybe you don't have to do the whole brain.

01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:23.560
Even getting a single neuron is because you might get down to, you need to be looking at electron micrographs of grains that are sliced at about 30 nanometer slices.

01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:29.560
So even just having a single person reconstruct a single neuron might take weeks.

01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:30.560
Well, I don't know.

01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:36.560
Maybe a bundle of K-lines is a half a millimeter thick.

01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:40.560
Oh, so you actually do some larger scale structure to start looking at.

01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:41.560
Yeah.

01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:44.560
Why not?

01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:49.560
I don't think they have no idea what to look for.

01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:55.560
I could give you 20 of those in five minutes, but nobody's listening.

01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:02.560
What scale?

01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:03.560
I don't know.

01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:05.560
I mean, they know what the neurons look like.

01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:09.560
So you know what to look for if you're saying there's a neuron that level.

01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:13.560
I'm saying you may only have to look at the white matter.

01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:15.560
Oh, yeah.

01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:26.560
Ignore the neurons because the point of K-lines is where do these go and what goes into them and out.

01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:27.560
I don't know.

01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:34.560
It's just this idea, let's map the whole brain, 100 billion things.

01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:36.560
And then people, I rest exit.

01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:40.560
Oh, and there's a thousand supporting cells for each neuron.

01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:47.560
He's just glaring in the obscurity of it rather than trying to contribute something.

01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:50.560
Anyway, if you run into him, give him my regards.

01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:59.560
I really wonder how somebody can write something like that.

01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:04.560
Yes.

01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:07.560
Excuse my ignorance, but what is a K-line?

01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:19.560
The idea is that suppose one part of the brain is doing something and it's in some particular state

01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:29.560
that's very important, like I don't know, like I've just seen a glass of water.

01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:41.560
Then another part of the brain would like to know there's a glass of water in the environment.

01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:48.560
And I've been looking for one, so I should try to take over and do something about that.

01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:54.560
Now at the moment, there's no theory of what happens in different parts of the brain

01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:57.560
for a simple thing like that to happen.

01:24:57.560 --> 01:25:11.560
No theory at all, except they use the word association or they talk about what are the purposeful neurons.

01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:13.560
Goal, forget.

01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:23.560
Okay, so my theory is that there are a bunch of things which are massive collections of nerve fibers,

01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:26.560
maybe a few hundred or a few thousand.

01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:35.560
And when the visual system sees an apple, it turns on 50 of those wires.

01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:41.560
And when it sees a pear, it turns on a different hundred or 50 of those wires,

01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:44.560
but about 20 of them are the same, so forth.

01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:47.560
In other words, it's like the edge of a punched card.

01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:52.560
Have you ever seen a card-based retrieval system?

01:25:52.560 --> 01:26:04.560
If you have a book that has, suppose it's about physics and biology and Sumatra.

01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:11.560
And a typical five-by-eight card has 80 holes in the top edge.

01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:20.560
So what you do is, if it's Sumatra, you punch eight of these holes at random, a particular set.

01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:26.560
They're assigned to the Sumatra, and then if it's, I forget what my first two examples were,

01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:30.560
but you punch eight or ten holes for each of the other two words.

01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:32.560
So now there are 24 punches.

01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:38.560
Only probably four or five of them are duplicates, so you're punching about 20 holes.

01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:45.560
And now, if something is looking for the cards that were punched for those three things,

01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:49.560
even if there are 30 or 40 other holes punched in the card,

01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:54.560
you stick your 20 wires through the whole deck and lift it up,

01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:59.560
and only cards fall out that had those three categories punched for.

01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:02.560
So you see, even though you had 80 holes,

01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:09.560
you could punch combinations of up to a million different categories into that,

01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:15.560
and if you have to put a bunch of wires through,

01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:20.560
you'll get all of the ones that were punched for those categories, the categories you're looking for,

01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:24.560
and you might get three or four other cards that will come down also

01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:30.560
because all of the eight holes were punched for some category by accident.

01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:34.560
Do you get the picture? I'll send you a reference.

01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:46.560
It was invented in the early 1940s by a Cambridge scientist here named Calvin Moores,

01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:53.560
and was widely used in libraries for information retrieval until computers came along.

01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:58.560
But anyway, that's the sort of thing you could look for in a brain

01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:03.560
if you had the concept in your head of Zato coding,

01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:08.560
but I've never met a neuroscientist who ever heard of such a thing.

01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:15.560
So you have this whole community which doesn't have a set of very clear ideas

01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:22.560
about different ways that knowledge or symbols could be represented in neural activity.

01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:26.560
So good luck to them when they get their big map.

01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:39.560
They'll still have to say, what do I do with a hundred billion of these intricate accounts?

01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:40.560
Yeah?

01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:45.560
What are your thoughts about the current artificial intelligence research at MIT,

01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:48.560
such as Winston's Legendes project?

01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:53.560
Winston is just about one of the best ones in the whole world.

01:28:53.560 --> 01:29:04.560
I don't know any other projects that are trying to do things on that higher level of common sense knowledge.

01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:12.560
He's just lost a lot of funding, so one problem is how do you support a project like that?

01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:25.560
Have you followed it? I don't know if there's a recent summary of what they're doing.

01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:32.560
We used to write a new book every year called The Progress Report.

01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:42.560
The nice thing is that we had a very good form of support from ARPA, or DARPA,

01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:48.560
which was every year we'd tell them what we had done.

01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:56.560
They didn't want to hear what we wanted to do, and things have turned the opposite.

01:29:56.560 --> 01:30:06.560
So what would happen is every year we'd say we did these great things, and we might do some more.

01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:14.560
It went on for about 20 years, and then it fell apart.

01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:23.560
One thing that's a nice story, there was a great liberal senator, Mike Mansfield,

01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:34.560
and unfortunately he got the idea that the Defense Department was getting too big and influential.

01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:47.560
So he got Congress to pass a law that ARPA shouldn't be allowed to support anything that didn't have direct military application.

01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:57.560
Congress went for this, and all of a sudden a lot of research disappeared, basic research.

01:30:57.560 --> 01:31:03.560
It didn't bother us much because we made up applications and said,

01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:15.560
well, this will make a military robot that will go out and do something bad.

01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:36.560
I don't remember ever writing anything at all, but anyway around 1980 the funding for that sort of thing just dried up because of this political accident.

01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:44.560
It was just an accident that ARPA, mainly through the Office of Naval Research, was funding basic research.

01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:48.560
That was a bit of history.

01:31:48.560 --> 01:32:00.560
If you look back at the year 1900 or so, you see people like Einstein making these nice theories.

01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:14.560
But Einstein wasn't a very abstract mathematician, so he had a mathematician named Hermann Weill polishing his tensors and things for him.

01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:24.560
And Hermann Weill's son, Joe, was at the Office of Naval Research in my early time.

01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:45.560
That office had spent a lot of secret money getting scientists out of Europe while Hitler was marching around and sending them to places like Princeton and other forms of heaven in Cambridge.

01:32:45.560 --> 01:33:01.560
And again, one of the reasons I was lucky is that I was here and all these, you know, if you had a mathematical question you could find the best mathematician in the world down the block somewhere.

01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:17.560
And Joe Weill was partly responsible for that, and the ONR was piping all that money to us for work on early AI.

01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:31.560
So it was a very sad thing that maybe the most influential liberal in the US government actually ruined everything by accident.

01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:48.560
ARPA changed its name to DARPA. It was Advanced Research Projects Agency, and it had to call itself Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.

01:33:48.560 --> 01:34:17.560
Well, Christianity wiped out science. That might happen tomorrow. Only choose your religion.

01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:46.560
It's a hard problem. The number of people working on advanced ideas in AI has gotten smaller and smaller as the, right now the around 1980 rule-based systems became popular.

01:34:46.560 --> 01:35:15.560
There are lots of things to do. Right now, statistical-based inference systems are becoming popular. And as I said, these things are tremendously useful, but the problem is if you have a statistical system, the important part is guessing what are the plausible hypotheses and then making up the, then finding out how many instances of that are correlated with such and such.

01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:29.560
So it's a nice idea, but the hard problem is the abstract symbolic problem of what sets of variables are worth considering at all when there are a lot of them.

01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:44.560
So to me, the most exciting projects are the kind that Winston is developing for reasoning about real-life situations. And the one that Henry Lieberman, would you stand up, Henry?

01:35:45.560 --> 01:36:02.560
Lieberman runs a world-class group that's working on common sense knowledge and informal reasoning. And it seems to me that that's the critical thing that all the other systems will need.

01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:16.560
In the meantime, there are people working on logical inference, which has the same problem that statistical inference has, namely, how do you guess which combinations of variables are worth thinking about?

01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:36.560
Then it seems to me that the statistics isn't so important. In fact, there's a great researcher named Douglas Lenat in Austin, Texas, who once made an interesting AI system that was good at making predictions and guessing explanations for things.

01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:52.560
And it was sort of like a probabilistic system. It had a lot of hypotheses, and every time one of them was useful in solving a problem, it moved it up one on the list.

01:36:52.560 --> 01:37:07.560
So Lenat's thing never used any numbers. It didn't say, this is successful .73 of the time, and now it's successful .7364825 of the time.

01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:17.560
What it would do is, if something was useful, it would move it up past another hypothesis, every now and then, it would put a new one in.

01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:30.560
Well, if you're trying to solve a problem, what do you need to know? You want to know what's the most likely to be useful one, and try that.

01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:36.560
You don't care how likely it is to be useful, as long as it's the most, right?

01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:50.560
I mean, if it's one in a million, maybe you should say, I'm getting out of here. I shouldn't be working in this field at all, or get a better problem.

01:37:50.560 --> 01:38:07.560
But Lenat's thing did rather wonderfully at making theories by just changing the ranking of the hypotheses that it was considered. No numbers.

01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:12.560
It did something very cute.

01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:36.560
It gave it examples of arithmetic, and it actually, this is a rather long effort, and it actually learned to do some arithmetic, and it invented the idea of division, and the idea of prime number, which was some number that wasn't divisible by anything.

01:38:36.560 --> 01:39:00.560
It decided that nine was a prime, didn't do much harm, and it crept along, and it got better and better, and it invented modular arithmetic by accident at some point, and it's a PhD thesis.

01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:09.560
A lot of people didn't believe this PhD thesis because Lenat lost the program tape.

01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:19.560
So he was under some cloud of suspicion for people thinking he might have faked it, but who cares?

01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:36.560
Anyway, I think there's a lesson there, which is that let's start with something that works, and then if it's really good, then hire a mathematician who might be able to optimize it a little.

01:39:36.560 --> 01:40:02.560
But the important thing was the order, and a good statistical one might waste a lot of time because here's this one that's 0.78, and here's this one that's 0.56, and it's the next one down, and you get a lot of experience, and it goes up to 0.57 and 0.58, and it never, you know, might be a long time before it gets past the other one because you're doing arithmetic.

01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:13.560
Whereas in Lenats, it would just pop up past the other one, and then it would get tried right away, and if it were no good, it would get knocked down again. Who cares?

01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:38.560
So it's a real question of, I don't know, mathematics is great, and I love it, and a lot of you do, but there should be a name for when it's actually slowing you down and wasting your time because there's a better way that's not formal.

01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:44.560
There are people who know the price of everything and the value of nothing.

01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:46.560
Yes, that's very nice.

01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:59.560
I know you're also a musician, so I have a music related question. What do you think is the role of music? Why do all cultures have it?

01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:12.560
I have a paper about it. Oh, okay.

01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:26.560
I've been trying to revise it, actually, but it's a strange question because there is music everywhere.

01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:45.560
On the other hand, I have several friends who are A musical, and so when I have this theory that music is a way of teaching you to represent things in their orderly fashion and stuff like that,

01:41:46.560 --> 01:42:04.560
well, I have three of my colleagues who aren't musical, but they dance, so it may be that I don't know the answer.

01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:28.560
The first theory in my paper is that when you have a lot of complicated things happening, then the only way to learn is to represent things that happen and then look at the differences between things that are similar and then try to explain the differences.

01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:36.560
Right? I mean, what else is there? Maybe there's something else.

01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:54.560
So in order to become intelligent and understand things, you have to be able to compare things, and to me the most important feature of what's called music is that it's divided into measures.

01:42:55.560 --> 01:43:00.560
Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba.

01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:11.560
And measures are the same number of beats or whatever they are, and so now you can say da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da.

01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:23.560
What's the difference? You change the eighth notes in the second one, the last four eighth notes, no, the two before last to a quarter note.

01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:33.560
So you're taking things that were in different times, and you're superimposing those times, and now you can see the difference.

01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:45.560
And the reason you can see the difference is that you have things called measures, and the measures have things called beats, and so things get knocked into very good frames.

01:43:46.560 --> 01:44:01.560
Now there's some Indian music which has 14 measures for a phrase, and some of the measures go seven and five, and I can make no sense of that stuff whatever, and I've tried fairly hard but not very.

01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:06.560
So I don't understand how Indians can think.

01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:13.560
Any of you can handle Indian music?

01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:19.560
I just want to add on what you said about this.

01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:33.560
My favorite quote from your paper on music-minded meaning is the one about what good is music, about how kids play with blocks to learn about space, and people play with music to learn about time.

01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:41.560
And I think in that sense both music and dance are different ways that people can arrange things in time.

01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:52.560
And in the sense like in proposatory music and in proposatory movement are both ways of different blocks if you will in time as opposed to space.

01:44:52.560 --> 01:45:06.560
Yeah, my friends who seem a-musically, maybe there's something different about their cochlea, or maybe they have absolute pitch in some sense, which is a bad thing to have.

01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:27.560
Because if you're listening to a piece composed by a composer who doesn't have absolute pitch, then you're reading all sorts of things into the music that shouldn't be there, and the opposite would be true.

01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:41.560
I read music criticism sometimes, and maybe the reviewer says, and after the second and third movement, he finally returns to the initial key of E flat major. What a relief.

01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:54.560
Well, I once had absolute pitch for a couple of weeks, because I ran a tuning fork in my room for a month.

01:45:55.560 --> 01:46:07.560
And I didn't like it, because you can't listen to Bach anymore.

01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:26.560
Oh, well. It's a good question. Why do people like music? And I don't know any other paper like mine. If you ever find one, I'd like to see it, because if you go to a big library, there are thousands of books about music.

01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:37.560
And if you open one, it's mostly Berlioz complaining that somebody wouldn't give him enough money to hire a big enough chorus.

01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:46.560
I've found very few books about music itself. Yes.

01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:58.560
Do you think that having a body is a necessary component of having a mind?

01:46:59.560 --> 01:47:08.560
Could you do just as well a simulated creature?

01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:11.560
Oh, sure. You could have all things.

01:47:11.560 --> 01:47:21.560
Simulation? I think a mind that's not in a world wouldn't have much to do. It would have to invent the world.

01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:31.560
And I don't see why it couldn't, but you might have to give it a start, like the idea of three or four dimensions.

01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:43.560
Can't you? What happens if you sit back and just think for a while?

01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:51.560
You wouldn't know if your body had disappeared, would you?

01:47:57.560 --> 01:48:02.560
There are also some strange ideas about existence and...

01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:10.560
Why do you think there's a world?

01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:17.560
One of the things that bugs me is people say, well, who created it?

01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:22.560
And that can't make any sense, because this is just a possible world.

01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:27.560
Suppose there are a whole lot of possible worlds, and there's one real one.

01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:31.560
How could you ever, how could you possibly know which one you're in?

01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:37.560
And then you could say, well, didn't someone have to make it?

01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:40.560
And what's the next thing you'd ask?

01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:44.560
Well, who made the maker?

01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:54.560
So the body-mind thing seems to me that once you have a computer, it can be its own world.

01:48:54.560 --> 01:49:07.560
The program can spend half the time simulating a world and half the time thinking about what it's like to be in it.

01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:10.560
Yeah?

01:49:13.560 --> 01:49:15.560
Yes, it's an empty concept.

01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:23.560
It's all right to say this bottle exists because let's say this bottle is in this universe.

01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:28.560
But what would it mean to say the universe exists?

01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:31.560
The universe is in the universe?

01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:40.560
So there's something wrong with thinking about, so there are only possible worlds.

01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:47.560
There's no, it doesn't make any sense to pick one of them out and say that's the real one.

01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:53.560
Yeah, but existence is relative.

01:49:53.560 --> 01:50:00.560
Yeah, you don't say this is the world I'm in, but you shouldn't say that doesn't mean it exists.

01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:04.560
Like, two is in the set of even numbers.

01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:07.560
What's the set of even numbers in?

01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:09.560
It doesn't stop anywhere.

01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:11.560
Yeah, lots of words.

01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:14.560
So is mathematics or is it only worlds?

01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:21.560
But physics explains the current world or are there no variables to use at this time?

01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:26.560
Well, you can't tell because five minutes from now, everything might change.

01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:30.560
So nothing ever explains anything.

01:50:30.560 --> 01:50:36.560
You just have to take what you've got and make the best of it.

01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:37.560
Yeah?

01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:43.560
Solutions are between systems, knowledge, and visual intelligence.

01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:44.560
Which knowledge?

01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:51.560
Like systems, basically, in general.

01:50:51.560 --> 01:50:57.560
Well, there are people who talk about systems theory, but I'm not sure that it's well-defined.

01:50:57.560 --> 01:51:06.560
Artificial intelligence means, to me, making a system that is resourceful and doesn't get stuck.

01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:18.560
And so if you have a system, and also it's a, how do you put it?

01:51:18.560 --> 01:51:21.560
Some definitions are not stationary.

01:51:21.560 --> 01:51:29.560
Like, what's popular?

01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:34.560
Popular is what's popular now.

01:51:34.560 --> 01:51:39.560
There isn't any such thing as popular music in terms of the music.

01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:49.560
I know there were, there was once a little department called Systems Analysis at Tufts,

01:51:49.560 --> 01:51:56.560
which had a couple of rather good philosophers trying to make general theory of everything.

01:51:56.560 --> 01:52:06.560
And they were writing nice little papers and it got, it moved along.

01:52:07.560 --> 01:52:14.560
But then there was a Senator McCarthy you've probably heard of, and he announced that,

01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:26.560
he had evidence that the, one of the principal investigators had slept with his wife before they were married.

01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:34.560
Well, Tufts was very frightened at this and abolished that department.

01:52:34.560 --> 01:52:43.560
And Bill Schutts went to California and started Eselin and had a good time for the next 50 years.

01:52:43.560 --> 01:52:48.560
I don't know, more stories.

01:52:48.560 --> 01:52:50.560
Yeah.

01:52:50.560 --> 01:52:55.560
Kind of was an extension of the body and mind question.

01:52:55.560 --> 01:53:02.560
It seems to me like we as humans, we learn a lot from just interacting with the environment.

01:53:02.560 --> 01:53:08.560
Like language and hearing, being spoken, we speak it, you know, we see things, we touch things.

01:53:08.560 --> 01:53:14.560
But it, as far as I know, a lot of the efforts in artificial intelligence so far have been

01:53:14.560 --> 01:53:20.560
confined to the computer that does not go out into the real world,

01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:25.560
and direct doesn't kind of turn to bitlessly learn new things.

01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:28.560
Well, here's the problem.

01:53:28.560 --> 01:53:32.560
I look over at Carnegie Mellon and there are some nice projects.

01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:37.560
And the most popular one is robot soccer.

01:53:37.560 --> 01:53:41.560
And here are these little robots kicking a ball around.

01:53:41.560 --> 01:53:46.560
They're Sony, what are they called?

01:53:46.560 --> 01:53:49.560
Yes, the Sony iBos.

01:53:49.560 --> 01:54:03.560
Sony stopped making the iBos, but it respected Carnegie and it made a little secret stash of iBos to send to Carnegie when the present ones break.

01:54:03.560 --> 01:54:16.560
But my impression of AI projects that have robots is that they do less, less, less than projects that don't.

01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:27.560
The reason is, if you have a robot like ASIMO, made by Sony, no, Honda,

01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:36.560
ASIMO can get in the backseat of a car with some effort, usually falls over.

01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:43.560
However, if you simulate a stick figure in a computer getting into a stick figure of a car,

01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:47.560
then you can make it learn to do that and get better and better.

01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:55.560
And so all AI projects without robots are way ahead of all AI projects with robots.

01:54:55.560 --> 01:55:02.560
And the profound reason is that robots are usually expensive and they're always being fixed.

01:55:02.560 --> 01:55:07.560
We have five students and the robot is being fixed.

01:55:07.560 --> 01:55:11.560
I don't know what they're doing, but they have to wait.

01:55:11.560 --> 01:55:19.560
Whereas if you have a stick figure robot, then you can just run it on this,

01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:23.560
although it might be a little slower than your mainframe.

01:55:23.560 --> 01:55:28.560
Probably not.

01:55:29.560 --> 01:55:35.560
Here's the theory that I just thought of.

01:55:35.560 --> 01:55:42.560
The idea of the body as a scene in abstract, basically a mechanism for input output.

01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:48.560
It's a set of sensors from which our brains can get information about the world

01:55:48.560 --> 01:55:52.560
and a set of actuators in which we can display our state.

01:55:53.560 --> 01:56:01.560
In that light, it's almost as if our brains are really independent on our body itself.

01:56:01.560 --> 01:56:05.560
It can adapt to any sort of body if we haven't hooked it up that way.

01:56:05.560 --> 01:56:09.560
It just so happens that we've been hooked up to this body since birth,

01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:14.560
that we have such good mental models of how to use this body.

01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:20.560
I guess an example from experiments that support this theory might be

01:56:20.560 --> 01:56:23.560
how when people have limbs amputated,

01:56:23.560 --> 01:56:27.560
it takes them a while to forget that they have the limb

01:56:27.560 --> 01:56:32.560
because their mental models still exist and their mental models don't go away overnight.

01:56:32.560 --> 01:56:37.560
Also, I guess they train monkeys to control robot arms with their brains.

01:56:37.560 --> 01:56:39.560
Sure.

01:56:39.560 --> 01:56:48.560
Well, but it just seems to me that a large amount of our brain is involved

01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:54.560
with highly evolved locomotion mechanisms.

01:56:54.560 --> 01:57:02.560
And as I said, when you're sitting back with your eyes closed in a chair

01:57:02.560 --> 01:57:10.560
thinking about something, then it's not clear how much of that machinery is important.

01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:20.560
But it might be that I have a strange paper on...

01:57:21.560 --> 01:57:28.560
I don't know if it's...

01:57:28.560 --> 01:57:38.560
I'm trying to remember its name. It's called...

01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:58.560
I can actually get a...

01:57:58.560 --> 01:58:06.560
I can't remember the name of the title.

01:58:06.560 --> 01:58:11.560
Oh, I give up.

01:58:11.560 --> 01:58:20.560
The idea is that maybe in the older theories of psychology,

01:58:20.560 --> 01:58:24.560
everything is learned by experience in the real world.

01:58:24.560 --> 01:58:32.560
So conditioning and reinforcement and so forth.

01:58:32.560 --> 01:58:36.560
In this theory, I call internal grounding.

01:58:36.560 --> 01:58:38.560
I make a conjecture.

01:58:38.560 --> 01:58:42.560
Suppose the brain has a little piece of nerve tissue,

01:58:42.560 --> 01:58:49.560
which consists of a few neurons arranged to make...

01:58:49.560 --> 01:58:53.560
not a flip-flop, but a...

01:58:53.560 --> 01:58:56.560
what would you call a three or a four-flop?

01:58:56.560 --> 01:58:58.560
A flip-flop with three or four states.

01:58:58.560 --> 01:59:00.560
Let's say three.

01:59:00.560 --> 01:59:06.560
If you put a certain input, it goes from...

01:59:06.560 --> 01:59:12.560
I couldn't find the chalk.

01:59:12.560 --> 01:59:15.560
So here are three states.

01:59:15.560 --> 01:59:17.560
And here's a certain input.

01:59:17.560 --> 01:59:20.560
That means if you're in that state, you go to this.

01:59:20.560 --> 01:59:26.560
And if you pop that input again, it does this.

01:59:26.560 --> 01:59:33.560
And if you say, go counterclockwise, it goes...

01:59:33.560 --> 01:59:36.560
So three of them get you back where you were.

01:59:36.560 --> 01:59:41.560
But if I go this, this, and that,

01:59:41.560 --> 01:59:47.560
that would mean to go like this, this, and back.

01:59:47.560 --> 01:59:49.560
So this would be...

01:59:49.560 --> 01:59:53.560
that means that's equivalent to just going one.

01:59:53.560 --> 01:59:55.560
Get the idea?

01:59:55.560 --> 01:59:59.560
Imagine that there's a little world inside your brain,

01:59:59.560 --> 02:00:02.560
which is very small and only has three states.

02:00:02.560 --> 02:00:05.560
And you have actions that you can perform on it.

02:00:05.560 --> 02:00:07.560
And you have an inner eye,

02:00:07.560 --> 02:00:12.560
which can see which of the three points of that triangle you're on.

02:00:12.560 --> 02:00:15.560
Then you could learn by experience

02:00:15.560 --> 02:00:19.560
that if you go left, left, left, you're back where you were.

02:00:19.560 --> 02:00:23.560
But if you go left, right, left, right, you're back where you are.

02:00:23.560 --> 02:00:28.560
And if you go left, left, right, that's like going one left.

02:00:28.560 --> 02:00:32.560
In other words, you could imagine a brain

02:00:32.560 --> 02:00:37.560
that starts out before it connects itself to the real world.

02:00:37.560 --> 02:00:43.560
It starts by having the top level of the brain

02:00:43.560 --> 02:00:45.560
connected to a little internal world,

02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:48.560
which just has three or four states.

02:00:48.560 --> 02:00:51.560
And you get very good at manipulating that.

02:00:51.560 --> 02:00:55.560
Then you add more sensory systems to the outer world,

02:00:55.560 --> 02:01:01.560
and you get to learn ways to get around in the real world.

02:01:01.560 --> 02:01:05.560
So I call that the internal grounding hypothesis.

02:01:05.560 --> 02:01:12.560
And my suggestion is maybe somewhere in the human brain,

02:01:12.560 --> 02:01:15.560
there's a little structure that's somewhat like that,

02:01:15.560 --> 02:01:20.560
which is used by the frontal part of the cortex

02:01:20.560 --> 02:01:24.560
to make very abstract ideas.

02:01:24.560 --> 02:01:27.560
You understand, the more abstract an idea is,

02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:31.560
the simpler and more stupid an elementary it is.

02:01:31.560 --> 02:01:33.560
Abstract doesn't mean hard.

02:01:33.560 --> 02:01:36.560
Abstract means stupid.

02:01:36.560 --> 02:01:43.560
Real things like this are infinitely complicated.

02:01:43.560 --> 02:01:49.560
So we might have, and I wouldn't dare suggest this to a neuroscientist,

02:01:49.560 --> 02:01:54.560
there might be some little brain center somewhere near the frontal cortex

02:01:54.560 --> 02:02:00.560
that allows the frontal cortex to do some predicting and planning

02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:05.560
and induction about very simple,

02:02:05.560 --> 02:02:09.560
few simple finite state arrangements.

02:02:09.560 --> 02:02:12.560
Who knows?

02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:15.560
Would you look for it?

02:02:15.560 --> 02:02:17.560
Well, if you were a neuroscientist, you could say,

02:02:17.560 --> 02:02:21.560
oh, that's completely different from anything I ever heard.

02:02:21.560 --> 02:02:23.560
Let's look for it.

02:02:23.560 --> 02:02:27.560
And if you're wrong, you're wasted a year,

02:02:27.560 --> 02:02:38.560
and if you're right, then you become the new Ramoni Kahal or someone.

02:02:38.560 --> 02:02:46.560
Who's the currently best neuroscientist?

02:02:47.560 --> 02:02:52.560
Maybe it's late.

02:02:52.560 --> 02:02:55.560
One more question.

02:02:55.560 --> 02:03:07.560
One last question.

02:03:07.560 --> 02:03:14.560
This is Cynthia Salman, who's one of the great developers of the logo language.

02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:17.560
Hey.

02:03:17.560 --> 02:03:19.560
Yes?

02:03:19.560 --> 02:03:24.560
Maybe it's that question for me.

02:03:24.560 --> 02:03:32.560
What do you think about theories such as Ramoni's theories

02:03:32.560 --> 02:03:35.560
that speak of no same thing?

02:03:35.560 --> 02:03:37.560
Completely weird.

02:03:37.560 --> 02:03:41.560
Obviously, those theories have nothing to do with human thinking,

02:03:41.560 --> 02:03:44.560
but they're very good for making stupid robots,

02:03:44.560 --> 02:03:52.560
and the vacuum cleaner is one of the great achievements of the century.

02:03:52.560 --> 02:03:56.560
However, his projects, what was it called?

02:03:56.560 --> 02:04:02.560
Cog disappeared without a trace.

02:04:02.560 --> 02:04:07.560
That theory was so wrong that it got a national award,

02:04:07.560 --> 02:04:11.560
and it corrupted AI research in Japan for several years.

02:04:11.560 --> 02:04:13.560
I can't understand.

02:04:13.560 --> 02:04:16.560
Brooks became popular because he said,

02:04:16.560 --> 02:04:21.560
maybe the important things about thinking is that there's no internal representation.

02:04:21.560 --> 02:04:24.560
You're just reacting to situations,

02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:29.560
and you have a big library of how to react to each situation.

02:04:29.560 --> 02:04:34.560
Well, David Hume had that idea,

02:04:34.560 --> 02:04:39.560
and he was a popular philosopher for hundreds of years,

02:04:39.560 --> 02:04:44.560
but it went nowhere, and it's gone, and so is Rod.

02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:48.560
However, he is one of the great robot designers,

02:04:48.560 --> 02:04:58.560
and he may be the instrumental in fixing the great Japanese nuclear meltdown,

02:04:58.560 --> 02:05:02.560
because they're shipping some of his robots out there.

02:05:02.560 --> 02:05:06.560
The problem is, can it open the door?

02:05:06.560 --> 02:05:12.560
So far, no robot can open the door, even though it's not locked.

02:05:12.560 --> 02:05:15.560
I usually start by asking if there are any questions,

02:05:15.560 --> 02:05:19.560
but I thought I'd say a few things about chapter one,

02:05:19.560 --> 02:05:23.560
and then see if there are any questions.

02:05:23.560 --> 02:05:26.560
I can't see the pointer.

02:05:26.560 --> 02:05:40.560
Oh, anybody remember how to get word to make its pointer not disappear?

02:05:40.560 --> 02:05:43.560
Maybe I mentioned this in the first lecture,

02:05:43.560 --> 02:05:56.560
but I was taken by this cute poem by Dorothy Parker,

02:05:56.560 --> 02:06:04.560
because the first chapter was about love and stuff like that.

02:06:04.560 --> 02:06:08.560
So I tried to get the rights to reproduce it,

02:06:08.560 --> 02:06:13.560
and it turned out that she was angry at all her friends.

02:06:13.560 --> 02:06:18.560
She must have been a perpetually pissed off person,

02:06:18.560 --> 02:06:25.560
and so she left all her literary rights to the NAACP,

02:06:25.560 --> 02:06:30.560
and I called them up for hours, and they couldn't find the rights.

02:06:30.560 --> 02:06:38.560
So finally, so it's in the version of the Emotion Machine on the web,

02:06:38.560 --> 02:06:48.560
but I had to resort to Shakespeare to replace her.

02:06:48.560 --> 02:06:51.560
Shakespeare's a slightly better poet,

02:06:52.560 --> 02:07:01.560
he's not as funny as Dorothy Parker.

02:07:01.560 --> 02:07:05.560
So the first chapter starts out,

02:07:05.560 --> 02:07:11.560
it's mostly about all the things we don't understand about the mind,

02:07:11.560 --> 02:07:15.560
which is almost everything,

02:07:15.560 --> 02:07:24.560
and the first discussion is, well the whole chapter is making fun of the most popular ideas,

02:07:24.560 --> 02:07:34.560
and the most popular idea of the mind is that people think that they're not doing the thinking,

02:07:34.560 --> 02:07:38.560
but there's something inside them that's doing the thinking.

02:07:38.560 --> 02:07:49.560
And it's this idea that there's a self is embedded in just about everything we say and think,

02:07:49.560 --> 02:07:53.560
and really it's hard to see how you would do without it.

02:07:53.560 --> 02:07:58.560
But if you ask what is the self,

02:07:58.560 --> 02:08:01.560
then since this idea is so popular,

02:08:01.560 --> 02:08:08.560
people begin to believe that there is such a thing and it takes all sorts of various forms,

02:08:08.560 --> 02:08:16.560
and the most dangerous form maybe is the one that religions exploit,

02:08:16.560 --> 02:08:21.560
which is that inside a person with all their complications,

02:08:21.560 --> 02:08:27.560
there's a little pure essence called the soul or the self or whatever you want to call it,

02:08:27.560 --> 02:08:37.560
and it's impossible to describe it or explain it in physical terms,

02:08:37.560 --> 02:08:45.560
and so that is one of the reasons why we think there are two worlds,

02:08:45.560 --> 02:08:50.560
a physical world and lots of other kinds of worlds.

02:08:50.560 --> 02:09:03.560
Each of us has some imaginary model of what they are and what they're in,

02:09:03.560 --> 02:09:08.560
and philosophers talk about it and existentialists and so on.

02:09:08.560 --> 02:09:13.560
So there are lots of problems about our ideas, about ourselves,

02:09:13.560 --> 02:09:19.560
and in reading around for half my life,

02:09:19.560 --> 02:09:26.560
I was puzzled at the strange ideas that are around,

02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:34.560
and in Aristotle, I find the first intelligible theories of mind and emotions.

02:09:34.560 --> 02:09:40.560
So if you look at particular Aristotle's, there are a number of books,

02:09:40.560 --> 02:09:43.560
and one of them is called Rhetoric,

02:09:43.560 --> 02:09:49.560
and it's full of theories about how people reason and influence each other,

02:09:49.560 --> 02:09:58.560
and I'll show you some quotes from that,

02:09:58.560 --> 02:10:05.560
because when I look at the history that I've encountered about psychology,

02:10:05.560 --> 02:10:11.560
Aristotle stands out as being the first and among the best,

02:10:11.560 --> 02:10:17.560
and as far as I can see, there were no psychologists nearly as good as him.

02:10:17.560 --> 02:10:21.560
Of course, we don't know whether there was a him exactly,

02:10:21.560 --> 02:10:26.560
because what we have of Aristotle is a lot of writing,

02:10:26.560 --> 02:10:32.560
but it's all cobbled together by students from all sorts of manuscripts by other people

02:10:32.560 --> 02:10:39.560
and people who took notes, and Aristotle claims to have learned a lot from Plato.

02:10:39.560 --> 02:10:44.560
We have very little writing from him,

02:10:44.560 --> 02:10:53.560
and so there you go, three centuries before the Christian era, as it's called,

02:10:53.560 --> 02:10:58.560
and then a couple of thousand years later,

02:10:58.560 --> 02:11:09.560
we start to find people like Spinoza and Kant and John Locke and David Hume

02:11:09.560 --> 02:11:13.560
who start to make psychology theories,

02:11:13.560 --> 02:11:21.560
very little of which is as good as the ones that Aristotle has in all his fragments.

02:11:21.560 --> 02:11:28.560
So one question that frequently bothers me and should bother everyone is

02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:32.560
why did science disappear for a thousand years,

02:11:32.560 --> 02:11:42.560
and the standard explanation is the rise of the great religions,

02:11:42.560 --> 02:11:49.560
and why did it come back, and you see with the first signs of anything like modern science,

02:11:49.560 --> 02:11:53.560
at least in my view, with Galileo and Newton.

02:11:53.560 --> 02:11:56.560
There are a couple of people before that.

02:11:56.560 --> 02:12:02.560
There are some people in the Muslim world who invented some high school algebra,

02:12:02.560 --> 02:12:05.560
and they make a big fuss about that.

02:12:05.560 --> 02:12:13.560
It looks like Archimedes, in a very recently discovered manuscript,

02:12:13.560 --> 02:12:15.560
computed in integral.

02:12:15.560 --> 02:12:24.560
He found the volume of a cone, which is, what is it, 1, 6th, B, H, I forget.

02:12:24.560 --> 02:12:30.560
Anyway, so why did science disappear,

02:12:30.560 --> 02:12:33.560
and why did psychology appear so late?

02:12:33.560 --> 02:12:39.560
Because there isn't much psychology in the modern sense until 1900,

02:12:39.560 --> 02:12:49.560
or the late 1800s, with Francis Galton and William James lived around here,

02:12:49.560 --> 02:13:00.560
and Rudolf Fleiss, who, Sigmund Freud, starts writing in 1895.

02:13:00.560 --> 02:13:05.560
People make fun of Freud, as I mentioned last week,

02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:10.560
but in fact, among other things,

02:13:10.560 --> 02:13:13.560
how many of you have read the recent criticisms of Freud,

02:13:13.560 --> 02:13:20.560
which claim that he was complete faker and never cured a single patient?

02:13:20.560 --> 02:13:22.560
This is popular stuff.

02:13:22.560 --> 02:13:27.560
I don't believe Freud ever really claimed to cure a single patient.

02:13:27.560 --> 02:13:31.560
So the critics, who are really very ferocious,

02:13:31.560 --> 02:13:35.560
claim that he made up all his data and so forth.

02:13:35.560 --> 02:13:41.560
But most of what Freud says is that psychoanalysis might be a good way

02:13:41.560 --> 02:13:46.560
to find out what you're really thinking and discover more about yourself

02:13:46.560 --> 02:13:50.560
and your goals and so forth.

02:13:50.560 --> 02:13:59.560
I had the good or bad luck to be introduced to L. Ron Hubbard when I was an undergraduate.

02:13:59.560 --> 02:14:04.560
John Campbell was the great editor of the, I think it was called,

02:14:04.560 --> 02:14:07.560
The Stounding Science Fiction in those days.

02:14:07.560 --> 02:14:09.560
What a marvelous title.

02:14:09.560 --> 02:14:16.560
And this fairly mediocre science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard

02:14:16.560 --> 02:14:22.560
invented a new form of psychiatry called...

02:14:22.560 --> 02:14:24.560
What was it called?

02:14:24.560 --> 02:14:27.560
Dianetics.

02:14:27.560 --> 02:14:29.560
It's pretty good.

02:14:29.560 --> 02:14:34.560
And I'll tell you that story another time.

02:14:34.560 --> 02:14:41.560
But John Campbell had Thanksgiving in the Commander Hotel every year

02:14:41.560 --> 02:14:44.560
and invited a bunch of friends.

02:14:44.560 --> 02:14:50.560
And I don't remember if that's how I got to meet Asimov and Heinlein and other people.

02:14:50.560 --> 02:14:57.560
But anyway, I did and science fiction had a big influence on me from my...

02:14:57.560 --> 02:15:05.560
Actually, early years, but starting in college, it got very serious.

02:15:05.560 --> 02:15:18.560
Anyway, so chapter one starts to talk about this phenomenon of psychology

02:15:18.560 --> 02:15:27.560
and one of the funny parts is this little section three, 1.3,

02:15:27.560 --> 02:15:31.560
of trying to say what are emotions.

02:15:31.560 --> 02:15:37.560
And I looked up emotions in dictionaries and can you all read that?

02:15:37.560 --> 02:15:43.560
I don't feel like reading aloud.

02:15:44.560 --> 02:15:50.560
There's lots of discussion of emotions and how mysterious and complex they are.

02:15:50.560 --> 02:15:59.560
And then the marvelous thing is how many words there are for emotional states.

02:15:59.560 --> 02:16:02.560
I think I got 300, but I don't remember.

02:16:02.560 --> 02:16:06.560
Anyway, here's from A to D.

02:16:06.560 --> 02:16:12.560
And I don't recall how I found those, but I think...

02:16:12.560 --> 02:16:15.560
But that's a lot.

02:16:15.560 --> 02:16:22.560
How many words for ways to think are there?

02:16:22.560 --> 02:16:30.560
Now, that's a serious question because I complained maybe on the next page.

02:16:30.560 --> 02:16:33.560
No, I didn't.

02:16:33.560 --> 02:16:38.560
I found myself complaining that there were very few words for ways to think.

02:16:38.560 --> 02:16:42.560
And then this afternoon when I was pruning these slides,

02:16:42.560 --> 02:16:45.560
it occurred to me that I didn't really try.

02:16:45.560 --> 02:16:52.560
So maybe I just didn't think enough.

02:16:52.560 --> 02:16:58.560
So if there are a couple of hundred words for everyday emotions,

02:16:58.560 --> 02:17:04.560
if any of you can find me a list of 10 or 20 common words for styles of thinking,

02:17:04.560 --> 02:17:12.560
I'd appreciate it because I wonder if there are a lot and if not, why not?

02:17:12.560 --> 02:17:24.560
So here's a list of typical situations, grieving for a lost child,

02:17:24.560 --> 02:17:27.560
panic at being in an enclosed space.

02:17:27.560 --> 02:17:33.560
I'm not sure any of the words in the list of 300 standard emotions

02:17:33.560 --> 02:17:41.560
are good enough to describe how you feel for any of these not unusual states.

02:17:41.560 --> 02:17:46.560
Have you ever lost control of your car at high speed?

02:17:46.560 --> 02:17:51.560
No, but when I first learned to drive, I couldn't believe that you could read signs

02:17:51.560 --> 02:17:59.560
at the same time as...

02:17:59.560 --> 02:18:06.560
Well, anyway, one of the very best psychologists in history,

02:18:06.560 --> 02:18:12.560
or a pair of psychologists, aren't even cold psychologists.

02:18:12.560 --> 02:18:18.560
These are two guys named Conrad Lorenz and Nico Tinbergen,

02:18:18.560 --> 02:18:21.560
and somebody made up the word ethology.

02:18:21.560 --> 02:18:24.560
What they study is the behavior of animals,

02:18:24.560 --> 02:18:29.560
and in some sense, presumably they're studying the psychology of animals

02:18:29.560 --> 02:18:36.560
because just as with a person, when somebody flies into a rage,

02:18:36.560 --> 02:18:38.560
you're not describing their mental state,

02:18:38.560 --> 02:18:42.560
you're describing something about how they behave.

02:18:42.560 --> 02:18:45.560
So the ethologists, too, are psychologists,

02:18:45.560 --> 02:18:52.560
and Tinbergen and Lorenz, starting around 1920s,

02:18:52.560 --> 02:19:00.560
started to analyze the behavior of animals in great detail.

02:19:00.560 --> 02:19:06.560
So here's an example of how a certain fish behaves.

02:19:06.560 --> 02:19:12.560
I actually forgot which fish it is, but there's a picture of it in the book.

02:19:12.560 --> 02:19:19.560
And at different points in its life, it's in different phases,

02:19:19.560 --> 02:19:27.560
and this is just one diagram of a dozen for this particular fish,

02:19:27.560 --> 02:19:34.560
and its reproduction, which involves an environment with plants and other things,

02:19:34.560 --> 02:19:40.560
and he divides its behavior into parenting, courtship, nesting and fighting,

02:19:40.560 --> 02:19:46.560
and then you see each of those has a lot of subdivisions.

02:19:46.560 --> 02:19:53.560
And Tinbergen and Lorenz and some students discovered all these things

02:19:53.560 --> 02:19:59.560
by sitting in front of fish tanks and watching the fish for months and years.

02:19:59.560 --> 02:20:08.560
Tinbergen also spent years on some beach watching seagulls,

02:20:08.560 --> 02:20:18.560
and so he has a diagram like this for a particular class of seagulls.

02:20:18.560 --> 02:20:28.560
When I came to Boston, my friends and I used to go to Nahant,

02:20:28.560 --> 02:20:33.560
and look at these tide pools there where there are a lot of activities,

02:20:33.560 --> 02:20:37.560
and it was very interesting, and I got a big fish tank

02:20:37.560 --> 02:20:45.560
and imported all sorts of little animals and plants from the tide pools in Nahant,

02:20:45.560 --> 02:20:50.560
and I watched them for about a year and didn't learn anything.

02:20:51.560 --> 02:21:00.560
That was before I read Tinbergen, and then I realized there's something about those people,

02:21:00.560 --> 02:21:04.560
which is they could watch a fish and recognize all sorts of behaviors,

02:21:04.560 --> 02:21:08.560
and I would just watch a fish and wonder whether it was hungry,

02:21:08.560 --> 02:21:15.560
or wouldn't you get bored swimming back and forth for three years in this.

02:21:16.560 --> 02:21:23.560
Anyway, so here are the great psychologists of our day, Aristotle,

02:21:23.560 --> 02:21:30.560
two thousand years ago, and Lorenz and Tinbergen in the 1930s,

02:21:30.560 --> 02:21:39.560
and Sigmund Freud and Galton and William James around 1900,

02:21:39.560 --> 02:21:42.560
and then what went wrong?

02:21:42.560 --> 02:21:47.560
There's almost no good psychology between then and 1950s

02:21:47.560 --> 02:21:51.560
when something called cognitive psychology started,

02:21:51.560 --> 02:21:56.560
and it was partly due to people who said,

02:21:56.560 --> 02:22:00.560
let's make psychology more scientific,

02:22:00.560 --> 02:22:04.560
and you've probably all heard of Pavlov or Watson,

02:22:04.560 --> 02:22:09.560
and what happened is around 1900, some psychologists said,

02:22:09.560 --> 02:22:14.560
well, these Galton's and Freud's and William James are very poetic

02:22:14.560 --> 02:22:19.560
and expressive and literary, and they write much better than we do

02:22:19.560 --> 02:22:23.560
and tell good stories, but they're not scientists,

02:22:23.560 --> 02:22:26.560
and they don't do reproducible experiments.

02:22:26.560 --> 02:22:31.560
So what we have to do is simplify the situation to find the basic laws of behavior.

02:22:31.560 --> 02:22:36.560
So let's take a pigeon and put it in a vacuum in the dark.

02:22:36.560 --> 02:22:44.560
Well, they didn't go that far, but they did put it in the dark,

02:22:44.560 --> 02:22:49.560
and there were two illuminated levers to work,

02:22:49.560 --> 02:22:54.560
and you could make a sound, and the sound could be very annoying,

02:22:54.560 --> 02:22:59.560
or you could have a right, annoying flashing light or something,

02:22:59.560 --> 02:23:02.560
and the animal would push one of two levers,

02:23:02.560 --> 02:23:07.560
and one of them would make the stimulus even more annoying,

02:23:07.560 --> 02:23:11.560
and one of them would make it go away,

02:23:11.560 --> 02:23:16.560
and you'd plot curves of how often the animal pressed these levers,

02:23:16.560 --> 02:23:20.560
so you would get a quantitative theory of how much it learned

02:23:20.560 --> 02:23:24.560
and how much it could remember and how many trials it would have to do,

02:23:24.560 --> 02:23:31.560
and then instead of just looking at reactions to stimuli,

02:23:31.560 --> 02:23:39.560
quickly switch to trying to teach the animal things by giving it two alternatives,

02:23:39.560 --> 02:23:44.560
turn left or turn right, or push this button or that or whatever,

02:23:44.560 --> 02:23:49.560
and if they pushed the one you approve of, then you'd give them a little pellet of food,

02:23:49.560 --> 02:23:56.560
and there was a lot of engineering so that you would make sure that the food got to them right away,

02:23:56.560 --> 02:24:02.560
because if there were a 10-second delay between an action and a reward,

02:24:02.560 --> 02:24:08.560
the pigeon or a squirrel or a rat or a cat or a dog would learn much less quickly

02:24:08.560 --> 02:24:11.560
than if there was a one-second delay,

02:24:11.560 --> 02:24:20.560
and anyway, that went on for 50 years, starting around 1900, Pavlov and his dogs,

02:24:20.560 --> 02:24:27.560
and there's a great movie that some guy came around with that had been taken of Pavlov's lab,

02:24:27.560 --> 02:24:34.560
and it shows sort of like a great dictator or something.

02:24:34.560 --> 02:24:39.560
There's this room with a lot of cages and dogs and mostly dogs in this case,

02:24:39.560 --> 02:24:43.560
and Pavlov comes in and there are a bunch of lackeys who sort of bow and scrape,

02:24:43.560 --> 02:24:47.560
because he's a lord, and he comes in,

02:24:47.560 --> 02:24:53.560
and all the dogs run into the corner of their cage and yelp.

02:24:53.560 --> 02:25:01.560
So the Pavlovians tried pretty hard to get that movie suppressed,

02:25:01.560 --> 02:25:07.560
and I haven't seen it in recent years,

02:25:07.560 --> 02:25:20.560
but anyway, Fred Skinner, who was a professor when I was an undergraduate at Harvard,

02:25:20.560 --> 02:25:26.560
was the first one to really automate this experimental psychology,

02:25:26.560 --> 02:25:29.560
and he invented what's called a Skinner box,

02:25:29.560 --> 02:25:36.560
but it's just a soundproof, lightproof, well ventilated and thermally regulated cage,

02:25:36.560 --> 02:25:42.560
and you can put a rat or a pigeon, those are the most common animals.

02:25:42.560 --> 02:25:47.560
They're very inexpensive because they're free.

02:25:47.560 --> 02:25:55.560
No one knows much about dolphins.

02:25:55.560 --> 02:26:00.560
They've been studied for 50 years, whenever, John, what's his name?

02:26:00.560 --> 02:26:05.560
Remember the name of the great dolphin?

02:26:05.560 --> 02:26:07.560
Lily, thanks.

02:26:07.560 --> 02:26:14.560
He discovered a lot about dolphins, and a certain amount about their communication,

02:26:14.560 --> 02:26:20.560
and a little bit about whales, but there's an interesting mystery.

02:26:20.560 --> 02:26:26.560
I forget which whales, but some whales have a 20-minute song,

02:26:26.560 --> 02:26:32.560
and they repeat it for a whole season, and next year that song is a little bit different,

02:26:32.560 --> 02:26:38.560
but it goes essentially without repeating, it's very complicated for 20 minutes,

02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:47.560
and people have studied that a lot, and no one has the slightest idea of what it means,

02:26:47.560 --> 02:26:51.560
and nobody even has any good conjectures, which bothers me.

02:26:51.560 --> 02:26:58.560
What I think it probably means is this, when there's a whole bunch of fish somewhere for one of these whales,

02:26:58.560 --> 02:27:04.560
it might be 200 miles away, and whales eat a lot,

02:27:04.560 --> 02:27:08.560
and it's very important to find where the fish are,

02:27:08.560 --> 02:27:16.560
and I believe this message, which changes a bit during the season,

02:27:16.560 --> 02:27:24.560
might be telling you where the food is on the Atlantic or Pacific coastline,

02:27:24.560 --> 02:27:30.560
in great detail, because if somebody finds a lot of fish somewhere,

02:27:30.560 --> 02:27:34.560
you have to swim 300 miles, and if they're not there.

02:27:34.560 --> 02:27:40.560
So anyway, it's interesting that John Lily got a lot of publicity,

02:27:40.560 --> 02:27:51.560
but he didn't discover squat, and finally the dolphin studyers gave up because nothing happened.

02:27:51.560 --> 02:27:57.560
Anybody have heard anything? I haven't paid any attention for 20 years.

02:27:57.560 --> 02:28:01.560
Have you heard of anybody discovering anything about dolphins?

02:28:01.560 --> 02:28:10.560
Except they're very good at solving a lot of physical problems.

02:28:10.560 --> 02:28:23.560
Anyway, that's unbothered by the mystery of why was there some psychology in Aristotle's time,

02:28:23.560 --> 02:28:34.560
and why didn't it get anywhere till 1950 when there was regular psychology,

02:28:34.560 --> 02:28:38.560
but it was afflicted by what I call physics envy.

02:28:38.560 --> 02:28:43.560
Namely, you run into people like Estes, and well, he was pretty good actually,

02:28:43.560 --> 02:28:51.560
but there are a lot of psychologists who made up things like Maxwell's equations for how animals learn,

02:28:51.560 --> 02:28:59.560
and there were generally three or four laws, and if there's a sequence of events,

02:28:59.560 --> 02:29:07.560
then animals remember a lot about the first few and the last few in the sequence.

02:29:07.560 --> 02:29:16.560
They don't remember much about the middle, and of course the reliability of their memory depends a lot on how recent it was

02:29:16.560 --> 02:29:24.560
and on how powerful the reward was and blah, blah, and so they get these little sets of rules that look like Newton's laws,

02:29:24.560 --> 02:29:34.560
and that was the kind of sort of psychological physics that the so-called behaviorists were mostly looking for.

02:29:34.560 --> 02:29:44.560
This was not what Tinbergen and Lorenz did, because they wrote books with extensive descriptions of what the animals did

02:29:44.560 --> 02:29:52.560
and made little diagrammatic guesses about the structure of the subroutines and substructures.

02:29:52.560 --> 02:29:57.560
Anyway, end of history, but it's a nice question.

02:29:57.560 --> 02:30:05.560
Why do some sciences grow and why was psychology just about the last one?

02:30:05.560 --> 02:30:15.560
I suspect it could have been earlier, but people tried to imitate the physicists and tried to say maybe there's something like Newton's

02:30:15.560 --> 02:30:26.560
or Maxwell's laws for the mind, and they found a few, but they weren't enough to explain much.

02:30:26.560 --> 02:30:31.560
There are a lot of questions.

02:30:31.560 --> 02:30:43.560
When Seymour Papert and I started thinking about these things, which was really around 1960,

02:30:43.560 --> 02:30:55.560
I had been working on some ideas about AI in the late 50s, and my PhD thesis was a theory of neural networks,

02:30:55.560 --> 02:31:04.560
which was sort of interesting, but never really went anywhere.

02:31:04.560 --> 02:31:13.560
I went to a meeting in London somewhere and gave a talk about a theory of learning that was based on some neural network ideas,

02:31:13.560 --> 02:31:23.560
and there was this person from South Africa named Seymour Papert who gave the same paper.

02:31:23.560 --> 02:31:29.560
I hope this happens to you someday.

02:31:29.560 --> 02:31:36.560
Find somebody who thinks so much like you, only different enough that it's worth it,

02:31:36.560 --> 02:31:46.560
and that you only have to say about three words a day and some whole new thing starts because we really did write the same paper

02:31:46.560 --> 02:31:54.560
and it had the same equation in it.

02:31:54.560 --> 02:32:01.560
He had been working for Piaget, who was the first great child psychologist.

02:32:01.560 --> 02:32:10.560
I should have mentioned Piaget, who probably discovered more things about psychology than any other single person in history,

02:32:10.560 --> 02:32:19.560
and there are lots of people now who are saying he was wrong about 0.73,

02:32:19.560 --> 02:32:25.560
because children learn that at the age of two and a half instead of two and three quarters.

02:32:25.560 --> 02:32:32.560
I'm parodying the Piaget critic community, but it's pretty bad.

02:32:32.560 --> 02:32:41.560
I think those poor guys are uncomfortable because Jean Piaget published 20 books full of observations about children

02:32:41.560 --> 02:32:47.560
that, as far as I know, no one had made systematically before,

02:32:47.560 --> 02:32:59.560
and in his later years he started courting algebraic mathematicians because he wanted more formal theories,

02:32:59.560 --> 02:33:09.560
and in my view he wanted to make his theories worse, and nothing much happened,

02:33:09.560 --> 02:33:23.560
but he did visit here a couple of times and it was really exciting to meet the starter of a whole new field.

02:33:23.560 --> 02:33:37.560
Anyway, Papert and I discussed lots of things, and somehow or other we kept finding other more ideas about psychology,

02:33:37.560 --> 02:33:46.560
and it finally gelled into the idea that, well, if you look at the brain, you know that there are several hundred different brain centers.

02:33:46.560 --> 02:33:59.560
What's all that stuff for? And how could it possibly make any sense to try to explain what it does in terms of four laws like Newton?

02:33:59.560 --> 02:34:08.560
Like, how does a car work? Is there a magical force inside the engine that causes the wheels to turn?

02:34:08.560 --> 02:34:20.560
No. There's this funny thing in the back to cause a differential so that if the car isn't going in a straight line,

02:34:20.560 --> 02:34:27.560
the two wheels going at different speeds won't rip the...

02:34:27.560 --> 02:34:32.560
If the two wheels were going at the same speed, the tread would come off in five minutes.

02:34:32.560 --> 02:34:37.560
You ever wonder what a differential is for?

02:34:37.560 --> 02:34:43.560
So, most of the car is fixing bugs in the other parts.

02:34:43.560 --> 02:34:51.560
Most of the brain is because we started out as fish, or lizards or whatever you like,

02:34:51.560 --> 02:34:58.560
and making the brain bigger wouldn't help much,

02:34:58.560 --> 02:35:05.560
because you'd just get a heavier lizard that had to eat more and would think more slowly.

02:35:05.560 --> 02:35:15.560
So, size is bad, but on the other hand, if you need another cubic inch of brain to fix the bugs in the other part,

02:35:15.560 --> 02:35:30.560
then the evolutionary advantage of being smarter had better make you able to catch a little more food per hour.

02:35:30.560 --> 02:35:36.560
So, each person is an ecology of these different processes,

02:35:36.560 --> 02:35:46.560
and the brain reached its present size about a million years ago, I guess.

02:35:46.560 --> 02:35:50.560
What's the current guess? Anybody been tracked?

02:35:50.560 --> 02:35:57.560
They keep discovering new ancestors of humans, and I don't have the patience to read about them,

02:35:57.560 --> 02:36:03.560
because you know that next week somebody will say, oh, that isn't in the main line,

02:36:04.560 --> 02:36:13.560
you were just unlucky to discover that skeleton.

02:36:13.560 --> 02:36:27.560
So anyway, Papert and I and a lot of students gradually developed this picture that the mind is made of lots of processes,

02:36:27.560 --> 02:36:34.560
or agents, or resources, or whatever you want to call them, and it's anybody's guess what they are.

02:36:34.560 --> 02:36:41.560
If you look at the anatomy of the brain, you know that people label regions,

02:36:41.560 --> 02:36:48.560
so it's very clear that this occipital lobe back here is largely concerned with vision,

02:36:49.560 --> 02:36:54.560
and I forget where the one for hearing is.

02:36:54.560 --> 02:37:00.560
If you destroy the part of the brain for hearing in some animals,

02:37:00.560 --> 02:37:07.560
you get a little bit of increased function in some part of the visual system

02:37:07.560 --> 02:37:13.560
that seems to enable the animal to hear a little bit and make some reactions.

02:37:14.560 --> 02:37:23.560
And there's a whole lot of hype, I think you have to call it, about the flexibility of the nervous system.

02:37:23.560 --> 02:37:28.560
That is, if certain brain areas get destroyed, other parts take over.

02:37:28.560 --> 02:37:35.560
They almost never are as good, and mostly many functions never get taken over at all,

02:37:35.560 --> 02:37:40.560
but are replaced by ones that superficially seem similar.

02:37:40.560 --> 02:37:48.560
And so there's a whole lot of, I guess, wishful thinking that the brain is immensely resourceful

02:37:48.560 --> 02:37:51.560
and error-correcting and repairing.

02:37:51.560 --> 02:37:58.560
I think there was some idea that it was a general phenomenon,

02:37:58.560 --> 02:38:02.560
but if you do some arithmetic, you get an interesting result.

02:38:02.560 --> 02:38:11.560
Suppose that each function in the brain occurred in ten different places at random.

02:38:11.560 --> 02:38:21.560
Then if you removed half the brain, how many functions would you lose?

02:38:21.560 --> 02:38:28.560
Well, almost nowhere arithmetic tells you you would lose about one part in the thousand.

02:38:28.560 --> 02:38:33.560
And so, in fact, you would never be able to detect it.

02:38:33.560 --> 02:38:41.560
So this idea that the brain has enormous redundancy will now change that number to five.

02:38:41.560 --> 02:38:47.560
Suppose each function is somewhat supported in five different parts of the brain.

02:38:47.560 --> 02:38:53.560
Then if you take off half the brain, then what am I saying?

02:38:53.560 --> 02:39:00.560
One part in 32, chance of losing some significant function.

02:39:00.560 --> 02:39:07.560
So probably lots of things that we do are supported in several parts of the brain.

02:39:07.560 --> 02:39:13.560
Apparently the language center is pretty unique and some others,

02:39:14.560 --> 02:39:23.560
be careful about the conclusions you read from optimistic neuroscientists.

02:39:31.560 --> 02:39:42.560
Anyway, Papert and I worked on this idea of how could these large numbers of different processes be organized

02:39:42.560 --> 02:39:52.560
and we made various theories about it and then around, I guess, the late 1970s,

02:39:52.560 --> 02:40:00.560
we stopped working together and Papert developed his revolutionary ideas about education,

02:40:00.560 --> 02:40:11.560
which certainly have had a lot of influence although they didn't sweep the world in the way we had hoped.

02:40:11.560 --> 02:40:19.560
And I kept working on the Society of Mind Theory and we didn't work together so much,

02:40:19.560 --> 02:40:28.560
but we still did plenty of criticizing and supporting of each other.

02:40:28.560 --> 02:40:36.560
Anyway, my theory ended up with this idea that it's sort of based on Freud.

02:40:36.560 --> 02:40:41.560
I don't know if I kept a picture of his here.

02:40:41.560 --> 02:40:49.560
Freud concluded that the mind was an interesting arena, sort of,

02:40:49.560 --> 02:40:54.560
and he had the mind divided into three parts.

02:40:54.560 --> 02:41:01.560
There's at one end of the mind, which we inherited from most other animals,

02:41:01.560 --> 02:41:09.560
is called the id, which is a bunch of instinctive, mainly built-in behavioral mechanisms.

02:41:09.560 --> 02:41:21.560
And a second part of the mind is what he called the superego, which is a collection of critics.

02:41:21.560 --> 02:41:26.560
So in Freud's first image, the brain is in two parts.

02:41:26.560 --> 02:41:31.560
One is a set of instinctive, built-in behaviors and the other is a set of critics,

02:41:31.560 --> 02:41:40.560
which actually are associated with a culture and a tradition.

02:41:40.560 --> 02:41:46.560
And you learn from other people things that are good to do and things that are bad to do.

02:41:46.560 --> 02:41:52.560
And that's called the superego.

02:41:52.560 --> 02:41:58.560
This is your set of values and standards and tests for suitable behavior.

02:41:58.560 --> 02:42:06.560
And the middle is this strange object called the ego, which is not what people think it is.

02:42:06.560 --> 02:42:16.560
At least Freud's word, the ego, is a kind of big neutral battleground where the instinctive behaviors,

02:42:16.560 --> 02:42:29.560
I keep wanting to, oh, you can see that arrow if I take my finger off it.

02:42:29.560 --> 02:42:36.560
And then gradually as I kept trying to figure out where, how problems are solved

02:42:36.560 --> 02:42:44.560
and what kind of processes might be involved, I got this picture which has six layers.

02:42:44.560 --> 02:42:53.560
And various people come around and say, I don't think you need to distinguish between layers four and five

02:42:54.560 --> 02:43:00.560
or why don't you just lump all the three top layers into one.

02:43:00.560 --> 02:43:15.560
And I sort of laugh quietly and say, these people are trying to find a physics like unified minimal theory of psychology.

02:43:15.560 --> 02:43:20.560
And they're probably right in one sense, but if they do that they'll get stuck

02:43:20.560 --> 02:43:28.560
because if you get a new idea there'll be no place to put it.

02:43:28.560 --> 02:43:35.560
So if you have something that's very mysterious, don't imitate the physicists

02:43:35.560 --> 02:43:41.560
because if you make a theory that's exactly right and just accounts for the data

02:43:41.560 --> 02:43:46.560
and there's nothing extra and nothing loose,

02:43:46.560 --> 02:43:56.560
even when you notice a new phenomenon like dark matter, then the physicists don't know what to do.

02:43:56.560 --> 02:44:03.560
Should they regard dark matter as some obscure feature of space-time

02:44:03.560 --> 02:44:08.560
or does it have something to do with this universe being near another one

02:44:08.560 --> 02:44:14.560
that you can't otherwise communicate with and it's all very puzzling.

02:44:14.560 --> 02:44:19.560
But there are lots of things that don't fit into Newton's laws these days.

02:44:19.560 --> 02:44:34.560
And I'm not suggesting a six-layer theory of physics, but it might be worth a try.

02:44:34.560 --> 02:44:47.560
Okay, so I made up some nice slides, but I think I'll stop.

02:44:47.560 --> 02:44:54.560
So who has some questions and what would you like to see in the theory of psychology?

02:44:54.560 --> 02:44:58.560
What do you want to be explained?

02:44:58.560 --> 02:45:08.560
A lot of people are convinced that there are some really serious problems and mysteries

02:45:08.560 --> 02:45:13.560
like what is consciousness?

02:45:13.560 --> 02:45:27.560
And if you look at chapter four, my feeling is consciousness is an etymological accident

02:45:27.560 --> 02:45:38.560
that people got a word which is a suitcase for all of the things they don't understand about the mind and more.

02:45:38.560 --> 02:45:44.560
But once you've got a word and it goes in the culture,

02:45:44.560 --> 02:45:49.560
consider the word consciousness for a minute from a legal point of view.

02:45:49.560 --> 02:45:59.560
Suppose that you happen to be walking along and you're carrying something.

02:45:59.560 --> 02:46:04.560
Where is that pointer?

02:46:04.560 --> 02:46:09.560
And it happens to stick somebody's eye out.

02:46:09.560 --> 02:46:23.560
Then it's very important when they sue you to establish whether you meant to do it or whether it was an accident.

02:46:23.560 --> 02:46:29.560
Did you consciously plan to...

02:46:29.560 --> 02:46:34.560
I can't think of the English word for putting somebody's eye out.

02:46:34.560 --> 02:46:45.560
There's be heading and also to gouge is a good word.

02:46:45.560 --> 02:47:00.560
So anyway, it's very important for social reasons to have a word for whether an action was deliberately violating the rules

02:47:00.560 --> 02:47:03.560
as opposed to accidentally violating the rules.

02:47:03.560 --> 02:47:10.560
Like if you tripped on the stairs and landed on somebody and broke their neck,

02:47:10.560 --> 02:47:19.560
that's not a crime unless you were so clever as to make it appear that it was an accident.

02:47:20.560 --> 02:47:23.560
Anyway, you see what I mean?

02:47:23.560 --> 02:47:31.560
So we need a whole system of fairness and ethics and social responsibility

02:47:31.560 --> 02:47:38.560
is based on the distinction between whether an action was deliberate or not.

02:47:38.560 --> 02:47:45.560
And so did he do that consciously is a word for that.

02:47:45.560 --> 02:47:48.560
And somehow the idea of conscious became elevated.

02:47:48.560 --> 02:47:50.560
Well, that's a very superficial.

02:47:50.560 --> 02:47:56.560
You can probably think of 10 other reasons why a word like that.

02:47:56.560 --> 02:47:58.560
Yes.

02:47:58.560 --> 02:48:04.560
Sometimes in your writing, it seems to me that there's both sides of it.

02:48:04.560 --> 02:48:06.560
Some of you argue both sides of it.

02:48:06.560 --> 02:48:09.560
It seems like in that kind of...

02:48:09.560 --> 02:48:12.560
I can well imagine there's that kind of representation.

02:48:12.560 --> 02:48:15.560
You have representation of self and representation of your mind,

02:48:15.560 --> 02:48:18.560
but then you say there's no self or no consciousness.

02:48:18.560 --> 02:48:24.560
Why can't you think about consciousness as just a process that is reasoning about your own mind?

02:48:24.560 --> 02:48:26.560
Well, I...

02:48:26.560 --> 02:48:30.560
I mean, I understand you don't want to talk about self as that's a real discussion, but...

02:48:30.560 --> 02:48:36.560
No, but sometimes when you say conscious, that is, do you remember doing it?

02:48:36.560 --> 02:48:38.560
Which is...

02:48:38.560 --> 02:48:44.560
Yeah, but don't want to load up my process that asks me what I think about my own mind

02:48:44.560 --> 02:48:47.560
and then I retrieve that and I say, yeah, I do remember it.

02:48:47.560 --> 02:48:48.560
Well, you're right.

02:48:48.560 --> 02:48:54.560
Actually, I went to a lot of trouble to find 25 or 30 different uses

02:48:54.560 --> 02:48:59.560
for the word consciousness, and probably if I...

02:48:59.560 --> 02:49:04.560
or if one of us worked harder, we could take those and condense them into five or six

02:49:04.560 --> 02:49:09.560
much better ones that account for more stuff than the 30.

02:49:09.560 --> 02:49:15.560
That might be just right for something.

02:49:15.560 --> 02:49:18.560
Who knows?

02:49:18.560 --> 02:49:22.560
Yes, well...

02:49:23.560 --> 02:49:30.560
I think that's a great criticism of one reason why people don't like these theories quite so much

02:49:30.560 --> 02:49:34.560
because I propose too many things.

02:49:34.560 --> 02:49:41.560
I really should reprint that criticism from RESTAC or hand it out

02:49:41.560 --> 02:49:45.560
because this neurologist who says,

02:49:45.560 --> 02:49:54.560
why is he telling us all these things about K-lines and representations and so forth?

02:49:54.560 --> 02:50:02.560
The answer is he's from a community that doesn't have enough variety yet.

02:50:02.560 --> 02:50:07.560
And I'd be the first to admit that I try to go overboard

02:50:07.560 --> 02:50:13.560
and think of five more things than are in the literature.

02:50:16.560 --> 02:50:21.560
But that emotion thing is nice.

02:50:21.560 --> 02:50:28.560
Remember that that was a serious challenge because when I made that list,

02:50:28.560 --> 02:50:36.560
I do have a laser pointer somewhere in my jacket probably.

02:50:37.560 --> 02:50:46.560
How many words for at least noticeably distinct ways of thinking or reasoning

02:50:46.560 --> 02:50:51.560
or figuring out or solving problems can you think of?

02:50:51.560 --> 02:50:54.560
Maybe there are 20 or 30.

02:50:54.560 --> 02:51:00.560
I just realized this afternoon that I never looked.

02:51:00.560 --> 02:51:05.560
I don't remember where I got this list.

02:51:07.560 --> 02:51:12.560
Can I ask about your perception of free will?

02:51:12.560 --> 02:51:18.560
I got a lot of readings that you don't have a strong sense of free will, so what is that?

02:51:18.560 --> 02:51:24.560
I think it's the same as the one for consciousness, namely it's a legal concept.

02:51:24.560 --> 02:51:28.560
The idea of free will is completely obscene, isn't it?

02:51:28.560 --> 02:51:34.560
What could it possibly mean if you did something for no reason?

02:51:35.560 --> 02:51:40.560
So it's a thoroughly empty idea, isn't it?

02:51:40.560 --> 02:51:42.560
Or what do you mean by it?

02:51:42.560 --> 02:51:50.560
Do you mean there's nobody ordering you around so you're free to do whatever you want?

02:51:50.560 --> 02:51:51.560
But of course you're not.

02:51:51.560 --> 02:51:56.560
You can only do what your computer computes you to do.

02:51:57.560 --> 02:52:06.560
In the same way that you show the fish diagram, the fish's actions are products of the environment

02:52:06.560 --> 02:52:10.560
and its current state, and it's essentially a turning machine.

02:52:10.560 --> 02:52:12.560
Well, it's some kind of machine, yes, sure.

02:52:12.560 --> 02:52:17.560
And so would you argue that we are also turning machines that are just turning out in the world?

02:52:17.560 --> 02:52:19.560
Sure.

02:52:19.560 --> 02:52:24.560
I've never heard of any even interesting alternative.

02:52:24.560 --> 02:52:30.560
In other words, people who insist on free will appear to me to be like people who believe

02:52:30.560 --> 02:52:34.560
that there must be a God who created the world.

02:52:34.560 --> 02:52:35.560
What's the next step?

02:52:35.560 --> 02:52:37.560
Who created the God?

02:52:37.560 --> 02:52:39.560
They don't take that step.

02:52:39.560 --> 02:52:45.560
So if your will is free, okay, then who's controlling it?

02:52:45.560 --> 02:52:47.560
There's nothing there.

02:52:47.560 --> 02:52:56.560
But legally it's great, because if somebody stole some money of their own free will.

02:52:56.560 --> 02:53:07.560
But suppose you were a peculiar kind of epileptic, and every now and then when you go by,

02:53:07.560 --> 02:53:11.560
your hand goes out and steals things.

02:53:11.560 --> 02:53:15.560
Then they, what do they do?

02:53:15.560 --> 02:53:19.560
They put you on parole?

02:53:19.560 --> 02:53:21.560
This is very strange.

02:53:21.560 --> 02:53:27.560
But if you look at religions, you see that people make money on them.

02:53:27.560 --> 02:53:37.560
13% of the world's product goes to people who make their living on concepts like free will and consciousness.

02:53:37.560 --> 02:53:39.560
So it's a big money thing.

02:53:39.560 --> 02:53:42.560
It's not just an accident.

02:53:42.560 --> 02:53:45.560
It's an industry.

02:53:45.560 --> 02:53:49.560
So both of those are concepts of society?

02:53:49.560 --> 02:53:50.560
They're parasitic.

02:53:50.560 --> 02:53:54.560
Imagine a society without the concept of consciousness of free will.

02:53:54.560 --> 02:53:56.560
But those are requirements for being free will.

02:53:56.560 --> 02:53:57.560
I don't think you could.

02:53:57.560 --> 02:54:04.560
You'd have to make up something to keep people in check and under control and to train them.

02:54:04.560 --> 02:54:12.560
It's like the rat being, the rat needs somebody to press the reward or punish button.

02:54:12.560 --> 02:54:21.560
And we have it built into our, a culture works because you build into people's head the machinery for suppressing doubt.

02:54:21.560 --> 02:54:26.560
And it's very clever.

02:54:26.560 --> 02:54:33.560
But you should think of it as an industry rather than an explicable phenomenon.

02:54:33.560 --> 02:54:37.560
How much money goes into, yes?

02:54:37.560 --> 02:54:44.560
How many ways of thinking can you think of right now?

02:54:44.560 --> 02:54:51.560
That's my challenge, in fact.

02:54:51.560 --> 02:54:59.560
There's probably a big list in some chapter or other, but there's nothing like this.

02:54:59.560 --> 02:55:10.560
What's the trick? Three, if I go like that.

02:55:10.560 --> 02:55:16.560
Actually, Dragon has a thing so you can tell it make things bigger.

02:55:16.560 --> 02:55:22.560
How many of you use the new Dragon program speech thing?

02:55:22.560 --> 02:55:26.560
I can't believe how good it is.

02:55:26.560 --> 02:55:31.560
I was talking to Henry Lieberman about it earlier.

02:55:31.560 --> 02:55:33.560
Yes?

02:55:33.560 --> 02:55:41.560
So I'm wondering, personally, you would say that the side of mind here is both humans and animals.

02:55:41.560 --> 02:55:46.560
Is it just that we have higher levels of organization than them?

02:55:46.560 --> 02:55:49.560
And so where would you draw that line?

02:55:49.560 --> 02:55:55.560
Like, do animals not have a notion of the cell that we describe in the book?

02:55:55.560 --> 02:56:06.560
That's a great question and it'd be interesting to think about ways to investigate it.

02:56:06.560 --> 02:56:14.560
People are, researchers are often, in fact, raising that question of,

02:56:14.560 --> 02:56:18.560
do animals have a representation of themselves?

02:56:18.560 --> 02:56:24.560
And there's a famous experiment, but I can't remember what its current status is,

02:56:24.560 --> 02:56:30.560
where you put a red dot on a chimpanzee's head,

02:56:30.560 --> 02:56:39.560
and when the chimp passes a mirror and sees that, the chimp might go like that.

02:56:39.560 --> 02:56:55.560
Whereas, I don't think a dog, when it passes a mirror, would rub its forehead to see if it has a red spot.

02:56:55.560 --> 02:57:04.560
I had a cat who walked past mirrors, because we have some wool full-sized mirrors around the house.

02:57:04.560 --> 02:57:11.560
And the cat walks by and there's this other cat in the mirror, and she pays no attention to it, whatever.

02:57:11.560 --> 02:57:18.560
So, of course, I don't know what happened the first three times she walked by that mirror.

02:57:18.560 --> 02:57:23.560
Because if you see another cat going by, you'd think it would...

02:57:23.560 --> 02:57:33.560
Anyway, it's a good question and people ask that and there's some evidence that elephants have a model of themselves.

02:57:34.560 --> 02:57:42.560
And maybe dolphins, and I don't know where...

02:57:42.560 --> 02:57:51.560
Have any of you heard any stories of other animals that can recognize, for example, when they've been painted?

02:57:51.560 --> 02:57:53.560
Which?

02:57:53.560 --> 02:57:54.560
Is it elephants?

02:57:54.560 --> 02:57:56.560
Yes, I think elephants.

02:57:56.560 --> 02:58:08.560
There's a famous child psychology experiment where, if you're less than a couple months old, you actually fail this test.

02:58:08.560 --> 02:58:15.560
So, it's actually something that comes as a sign of your child progressing.

02:58:15.560 --> 02:58:20.560
So, it might not be intrinsic to humanity, but it might be so.

02:58:20.560 --> 02:58:23.560
So, I'm sure that the chimp can see how it can do that.

02:58:24.560 --> 02:58:43.560
This is off the topic, but I once had a great email correspondence with some woman who was getting a PhD in France about how babies recognize their mothers.

02:58:44.560 --> 02:58:47.560
And she concluded with...

02:58:47.560 --> 02:58:56.560
You did experiments after having other people walk into the room with a mask of the mother or a different hairdo and so forth.

02:58:56.560 --> 02:59:07.560
And for the first two months or three months, I think, it turned out that the baby recognizes the mother by the hairdo, which had not been known.

02:59:07.560 --> 02:59:16.560
And then, I think, after three months, it's recognizing the mother by a face.

02:59:16.560 --> 02:59:27.560
And at that point, she's doing experiments where you get another woman wearing a copy of the mother's face.

02:59:27.560 --> 02:59:33.560
And so, now there's two mothers and the baby is absolutely delighted.

02:59:34.560 --> 02:59:46.560
And then, as I can't remember, then I think at four or five months, when two copies of the mother comes in, the baby gets really panicked.

02:59:46.560 --> 02:59:52.560
So, I lost track of her.

02:59:52.560 --> 02:59:56.560
If you have a baby, let me know.

03:00:01.560 --> 03:00:08.560
She got her PhD for this, and I haven't heard anything since. Yes?

03:00:08.560 --> 03:00:16.560
Here's sort of a formulated thought that I just thought of regarding ways of thinking and ways of feeling.

03:00:16.560 --> 03:00:25.560
So, it just occurred to me that it seems like, if you go back to the list of feelings, it seems like when we talk about feeling, we're talking about a state that the brain is in.

03:00:25.560 --> 03:00:34.560
So, it might be a complicated state that's like some combination of a lot of different parameters, but it's a state that you can stay in for like an arbitrary amount of time.

03:00:34.560 --> 03:00:45.560
But I think thinking is something that's more sequential, as in like, when you're thinking, you're necessarily changing the state of your brain all the time because you're moving bits around.

03:00:46.560 --> 03:00:50.560
No, I think that's right.

03:00:50.560 --> 03:00:54.560
I think when we talk about intelligent behavior, you're absolutely right.

03:00:54.560 --> 03:01:02.560
What you've got is a process that's criticizing itself and seeing when you got stuck in finding things to do.

03:01:03.560 --> 03:01:17.560
And I suppose in each emotional state, you're certainly also thinking, so that's going on, but maybe it's more restricted.

03:01:17.560 --> 03:01:37.560
If you're confronting somebody and there's a sort of conflict, then almost all your thoughts are constrained to that subject and it's not as resourceful, but I'm just improvising.

03:01:48.560 --> 03:02:14.560
Okay, I think what I'm talking about in this context is sort of extreme forms where the person changes into another machine and it's like an angry person won't listen to reason.

03:02:15.560 --> 03:02:21.560
Or it's very hard to deflect them, so it's this kind of rigid thing.

03:02:21.560 --> 03:02:30.560
But humans are generally, are rarely in such extreme states where nothing gets through.

03:02:31.560 --> 03:02:49.560
The whole point of that was that, and I just realized that maybe it was just too lazy, that we have this huge vocabulary of nuances of emotional activity.

03:02:49.560 --> 03:03:00.560
And people think these are, also people think that these are hard to explain and mysterious and non-physical and blah, blah, blah.

03:03:00.560 --> 03:03:15.560
But why do we wait till next week and see if somebody comes up with, or see if we can come up with a set of 30 or 40 words about intellectual states, curiosity.

03:03:16.560 --> 03:03:23.560
I just don't know how many there are and I haven't thought of any in the last few minutes.

03:03:23.560 --> 03:03:26.560
Yes, has anybody thought of a couple of...

03:03:26.560 --> 03:03:31.560
What's the word?

03:03:31.560 --> 03:03:40.560
Flow, like just in the high, when you're really engaged in some activity that you're doing and you're really in the zone.

03:03:41.560 --> 03:03:48.560
Yes, there's this, there's a state of keeping other things out so you can focus.

03:03:48.560 --> 03:03:51.560
Not being interuptable, yes.

03:03:51.560 --> 03:03:58.560
So in this side of mind, you talked about agents and how they divide between themselves.

03:03:58.560 --> 03:04:08.560
But I don't see anywhere about how evolution modified a lot agents.

03:04:08.560 --> 03:04:13.560
Like I believe that evolution modified the way we think right now.

03:04:13.560 --> 03:04:18.560
I don't know if you saw, there's a paper like wrote like two years ago.

03:04:18.560 --> 03:04:21.560
It's called The Region of Behavior.

03:04:21.560 --> 03:04:26.560
And this guy tried to explain like how we make some decisions.

03:04:26.560 --> 03:04:32.560
Evolutionary, like in a point of view of like our speech.

03:04:33.560 --> 03:04:41.560
We are maximizing the probability of reproducing ourselves.

03:04:41.560 --> 03:04:47.560
But individually we are not kind of increasing these efficiencies.

03:04:47.560 --> 03:04:54.560
And like I think somehow like these agents would be like the decisions of agents or resources

03:04:54.560 --> 03:05:04.560
would be like very determined by evolution since we have like a very long time to like of evolution of the human being.

03:05:04.560 --> 03:05:08.560
And somehow we have like hard wire to make some decisions.

03:05:08.560 --> 03:05:13.560
So for example, like he gives the example of like a guy.

03:05:13.560 --> 03:05:16.560
Well, for lizards that's certainly true.

03:05:16.560 --> 03:05:21.560
But why do humans keep changing their environment?

03:05:21.560 --> 03:05:27.560
So like for example, yeah, so he gives this example of like tossing a point.

03:05:27.560 --> 03:05:31.560
The guy says that like this coin is unfair.

03:05:31.560 --> 03:05:41.560
And like there is seven, he doesn't say the probabilities, but there is 75% of getting heads and 25% of getting tails.

03:05:41.560 --> 03:05:52.560
And like we like the subjects, they choose run only 25% of the time the tails.

03:05:52.560 --> 03:06:00.560
Even though they like they can take account of the number of the times that you put heads.

03:06:00.560 --> 03:06:10.560
And even though if you choose always hands, you would get more money or whatever you would make it the right decision.

03:06:11.560 --> 03:06:13.560
That's called probability matching.

03:06:13.560 --> 03:06:16.560
And it's not a good strategy.

03:06:16.560 --> 03:06:18.560
Yeah, but humans do that.

03:06:18.560 --> 03:06:25.560
No, well, they do it if the psychologist rigs the experiment very carefully.

03:06:25.560 --> 03:06:29.560
It turns out that the best things, what do you think is the optimal strategy?

03:06:29.560 --> 03:06:30.560
Always.

03:06:30.560 --> 03:06:39.560
No, the optimal strategy turns out it's the square roots of the probabilities normalized to add up to one.

03:06:39.560 --> 03:06:43.560
And I'll, I'll give you a proof next time.

03:06:43.560 --> 03:06:49.560
This theorem is due to Ray Solomon off who invented inductive probability theory.

03:06:49.560 --> 03:06:59.560
So evolution, if evolution did probability matching, then it would be wrong.

03:06:59.560 --> 03:07:06.560
And I bet you'll find out that those experiments are wrong.

03:07:06.560 --> 03:07:16.560
You have to see how did he rig the experiment so that people, if it's probability 25%, they guess that 25%.

03:07:16.560 --> 03:07:22.560
I don't know.

03:07:22.560 --> 03:07:26.560
There was a theory about why you would expect it.

03:07:26.560 --> 03:07:27.560
It's a good question.

03:07:27.560 --> 03:07:30.560
I don't think people use probabilities though.

03:07:30.560 --> 03:07:45.560
So even if an experiment shows some, I would look for a flaw in the design of the experiment.

03:07:45.560 --> 03:07:46.560
Yes.

03:07:47.560 --> 03:07:50.560
You talked about a lot of emotions today, I'm sure.

03:07:50.560 --> 03:08:05.560
And my understanding is that for someone who has a specific personality, they might have a predisposition to feel certain emotions, like anger, depression, or whatnot.

03:08:05.560 --> 03:08:20.560
My question is that if you had any kind of insight or theories on to what extent our personality is affected by events or influences that happened to us over the course of a lifetime.

03:08:20.560 --> 03:08:28.560
And to what extent is it impacted by sort of, you know, chemical violence when you wake up or carbohydrate?

03:08:28.560 --> 03:08:33.560
Well you're asking what things do, what do people learn?

03:08:34.560 --> 03:08:37.560
We don't care if it's chemical or...

03:08:37.560 --> 03:08:42.560
See if it's chemical, it's still physical.

03:08:42.560 --> 03:08:49.560
I mean, I reckon we'll go to that sort of treatment for your depression.

03:08:49.560 --> 03:09:01.560
And the argument is that a lot of reasons for your depression is because of some sort of chemical or biological way of operating is constructed.

03:09:01.560 --> 03:09:04.560
Well there's lots of complicated things about the brain.

03:09:04.560 --> 03:09:09.560
One feature of the brain that I don't know if everybody...

03:09:09.560 --> 03:09:14.560
You know that there are inhibitory and excitatory synapses.

03:09:14.560 --> 03:09:30.560
When one neuron connects to another, the impulse that goes along the axon to the target neuron may reduce the probability or the strength of its firing or increase it.

03:09:30.560 --> 03:09:35.560
So that's called inhibiting or...

03:09:35.560 --> 03:09:38.560
There's no...

03:09:38.560 --> 03:09:42.560
Or exciting, that's not quite the right word is it?

03:09:42.560 --> 03:09:47.560
Now generally in the nervous system has a rule but not always.

03:09:47.560 --> 03:09:56.560
If you follow a chain of activity, it goes inhibiting, exciting, inhibiting, exciting.

03:09:56.560 --> 03:10:06.560
If you had too many excitatory things and there was a loop, then it would explode and it would wear itself out and jig time.

03:10:06.560 --> 03:10:11.560
So there is this general feature of the anatomy that you alternate.

03:10:11.560 --> 03:10:25.560
So when somebody talks about a drug having an inhibitory effect, that's sort of weird because it's inhibiting half the neurons and therefore lowering the thresholds.

03:10:25.560 --> 03:10:28.560
Of the ones they're connected to and so on.

03:10:28.560 --> 03:10:45.560
So I think the best thing is until you have a diagram of the functional relations between different brain centers, it might be best not to try to make generalizations about how the chemistry works.

03:10:46.560 --> 03:11:03.560
It's easy but people think of adrenaline as a stimulant but in the nervous epinephrine but in the nervous system it's locally it may be inhibiting things that are inhibiting something else.

03:11:03.560 --> 03:11:05.560
And so it appears to be exciting.

03:11:05.560 --> 03:11:07.560
Yes.

03:11:07.560 --> 03:11:26.560
I have a problem understanding the difference between thoughts and emotions and knowing something might be as simple but since the only thing that I can separate in my mind is that thoughts, so let's call it a time constant, I can change it kind of rapidly.

03:11:26.560 --> 03:11:32.560
Emotions, time constant is long and I can control it again much less.

03:11:32.560 --> 03:11:45.560
But since there is no, at least in this class, there is no preview, how can I make a decision on where the dividing line between these two entities is?

03:11:45.560 --> 03:11:49.560
Oh, I think it's a waste of time.

03:11:49.560 --> 03:12:02.560
As far as I can see, emotional mechanisms are generally lower level simpler ones than the ones that involve several layers of the, more layers of the brain.

03:12:02.560 --> 03:12:04.560
So it's just a relative thing.

03:12:04.560 --> 03:12:07.560
It's not that some states are emotional.

03:12:07.560 --> 03:12:12.560
You're always having some high level thoughts and low level thoughts.

03:12:12.560 --> 03:12:20.560
And the distinction, I just don't know why the distinction has occupied so much tension.

03:12:20.560 --> 03:12:30.560
I think it's because, and that goes back to having more words for, or asking how many words do we have for ways to think.

03:12:31.560 --> 03:12:43.560
It seems to me that in popular culture, there are very few words for ways to think and lots of words for emotions and so they're very prominent.

03:12:43.560 --> 03:12:51.560
Maybe you have to be smarter to distinguish between ways to think and people generally are dumb.

03:12:51.560 --> 03:13:02.560
Not because they're inherently dumb, but they come from cultures which bully you if you, you know, what happens if you're in third grade and you're smart.

03:13:02.560 --> 03:13:11.560
You get it beaten out of you and you learn not to show it.

03:13:11.560 --> 03:13:21.560
Kind of looked like that question of why science happened earlier and why we have more ways to describe different ways to think.

03:13:21.560 --> 03:13:29.560
And that sort of puzzled me, but can we just not reflect it as much on different thinking states or different approaches?

03:13:29.560 --> 03:13:32.560
I wonder if the Greeks had more, but we...

03:13:32.560 --> 03:13:42.560
I think they did. I think they had also more concept of ideas and different states and their approaches.

03:13:45.560 --> 03:13:50.560
Who has a theory of that? What's your theory of the Middle Ages?

03:13:53.560 --> 03:13:57.560
How could things get dark for so, so dark for so long?

03:13:58.560 --> 03:14:02.560
Well, I do have a theory.

03:14:02.560 --> 03:14:05.560
And are we about to have one?

03:14:05.560 --> 03:14:17.560
I think it has this much to do with the channels in which one can communicate ideas to other people, whether they exist or not, whether the arteries are over their clothes.

03:14:17.560 --> 03:14:23.560
The Middle Ages were characterized by scientific discoveries being kept as family secrets.

03:14:24.560 --> 03:14:31.560
Ah, Cardan knew how to take cube roots and he wouldn't tell anyone.

03:14:31.560 --> 03:14:39.560
Well, the classic student example is baby talk, which for 300 years made a single Italian family very rich.

03:14:39.560 --> 03:14:46.560
You know, using tunnels to extract the baby and crop earth increased success rate in difficult births by about 10% they say.

03:14:46.560 --> 03:14:47.560
Wow.

03:14:47.560 --> 03:14:52.560
And that was enough to build a family fortune until some servant finally stole the gene.

03:14:58.560 --> 03:15:01.560
So, who has a theory of the Middle Ages?

03:15:01.560 --> 03:15:04.560
Is there a standard theory? Yes.

03:15:04.560 --> 03:15:10.560
Well, the concept of the Middle Ages as the dark ages is something that emerged mostly in the Renaissance,

03:15:10.560 --> 03:15:21.560
when people in the 14th, 15th, 16th century tried to present themselves as going back to the classical age of scholarship of ancient Greece and Rome,

03:15:21.560 --> 03:15:25.560
and as being better than their predecessor for the last few years.

03:15:25.560 --> 03:15:31.560
This mostly happened because of the discovery of manuscripts that were translated from the ancient Greek,

03:15:31.560 --> 03:15:39.560
and in certain cases Latin by muslims who at the time were sort of receding from Europe.

03:15:40.560 --> 03:15:45.560
So, the entire concept of the Middle Ages might be a fabrication of the Renaissance.

03:15:45.560 --> 03:15:48.560
There were some significant discoveries at the time.

03:15:48.560 --> 03:15:49.560
That's a nice idea.

03:15:49.560 --> 03:15:52.560
In other words, when was St. Patrick?

03:15:52.560 --> 03:15:54.560
St. Patrick.

03:15:54.560 --> 03:16:04.560
I'm told that he popularized a lot of technical manuscripts, brought them back into Europe.

03:16:04.560 --> 03:16:09.560
He has two achievements.

03:16:09.560 --> 03:16:17.560
One was bringing scientific culture back, and the other was getting snakes out of England or something.

03:16:17.560 --> 03:16:19.560
Ireland.

03:16:19.560 --> 03:16:22.560
I don't know which he was sainted for.

03:16:22.560 --> 03:16:25.560
Don't you have to do three miracles, or is it?

03:16:25.560 --> 03:16:29.560
What's, what's, yeah?

03:16:29.560 --> 03:16:34.560
Yeah, my theory is that the Middle Ages ended around 2100.

03:16:34.560 --> 03:16:40.560
Because they'll say, after the Middle Ages ended, they'll say, you know, those guys back in the 21st century,

03:16:40.560 --> 03:16:43.560
they had no idea how thinking worked.

03:16:43.560 --> 03:16:47.560
They couldn't even think of a few ways to think.

03:16:47.560 --> 03:16:50.560
They had poverty, they had wars.

03:16:50.560 --> 03:16:53.560
You know, those guys were barely out of their winecloths.

03:16:53.560 --> 03:16:56.560
Right.

03:16:56.560 --> 03:16:58.560
I just read a history of AI.

03:16:58.560 --> 03:17:00.560
I forget who wrote it.

03:17:00.560 --> 03:17:07.560
But it had this section saying, it mentioned the Newell Simon.

03:17:07.560 --> 03:17:12.560
There was a thing called general problem solver, which I mentioned a couple of times in the book.

03:17:12.560 --> 03:17:19.560
And it's the idea that the way to solve a problem is to find, it's a symbolic servo.

03:17:19.560 --> 03:17:23.560
Find the difference between what you have and what you want.

03:17:23.560 --> 03:17:27.560
And look in your memory for something that can reduce that difference.

03:17:27.560 --> 03:17:28.560
Keep doing that.

03:17:28.560 --> 03:17:36.560
And of course, it's, it's important to pay attention to the more important differences first and so forth.

03:17:36.560 --> 03:17:39.560
And I'll send you this article.

03:17:39.560 --> 03:17:46.560
This article is saying that they made a terrible mistake and this was a trivial theory.

03:17:46.560 --> 03:17:48.560
And that's why nobody uses it anymore.

03:17:48.560 --> 03:17:55.560
And it was interesting how many AI people fell for that idea in the 1960s.

03:17:55.560 --> 03:18:08.560
My complaint has been that if you look in a modern textbook on, you must have some in your first volume, Pat.

03:18:08.560 --> 03:18:15.560
Didn't you have some GPS things?

03:18:15.560 --> 03:18:20.560
If you want to keep up with AI, you should read Patrick's textbook, even though he's,

03:18:20.560 --> 03:18:28.560
people are starting to use this new one, which doesn't have any AI in it.

03:18:28.560 --> 03:18:30.560
By, who's it by?

03:18:30.560 --> 03:18:32.560
Russell and Norvig.

03:18:32.560 --> 03:18:33.560
Russell and Norvig.

03:18:33.560 --> 03:18:41.560
It's probably pretty good technically, but I leafed through it and it didn't have any, never mind.

03:18:41.560 --> 03:18:54.560
It's probably better than I think because I'm jealous.

03:18:54.560 --> 03:18:57.560
Yes.

03:18:57.560 --> 03:18:59.560
It's kind of a different topic.

03:18:59.560 --> 03:19:05.560
In Society of Learning, you're talking about the amnesia of infancy when you forget what you learned

03:19:05.560 --> 03:19:08.560
and things that were once difficult to become common sense.

03:19:08.560 --> 03:19:10.560
You can't even remember how it wasn't like that.

03:19:10.560 --> 03:19:14.560
So it's just kind of wondering about the reverse of that process when you try and say,

03:19:14.560 --> 03:19:18.560
do something to somebody that you turn on so that people can get your quick awareness on it

03:19:18.560 --> 03:19:23.560
and bring back up the different levels.

03:19:23.560 --> 03:19:36.560
I was wondering about, is that itself another way of relearning the things that you learned?

03:19:36.560 --> 03:19:41.560
That's sure an interesting question.

03:19:41.560 --> 03:19:52.560
When I first learned about programming, I had the idea that maybe babies think in machine language

03:19:52.560 --> 03:19:59.560
and then after a while they start to think in FORTRAN.

03:19:59.560 --> 03:20:05.560
And then finally when they're a little older, they think in ALGO or something.

03:20:05.560 --> 03:20:14.560
But when they switch from machine language to FORTRAN, then they can't remember their earlier thoughts.

03:20:14.560 --> 03:20:30.560
And there's almost no evidence of people finding genuine recollections from two-year-olds at later ages.

03:20:30.560 --> 03:20:33.560
Now almost everybody thinks they remember something,

03:20:33.560 --> 03:20:39.560
but there's the problem that you might have rehearsed it and translated it into the FORTRAN

03:20:39.560 --> 03:20:47.560
and the ALGO and the LISP and the logo, whatever it is.

03:20:47.560 --> 03:20:57.560
I had one of my greatest influences was a great mathematician named Andrew Gleason at Harvard,

03:20:57.560 --> 03:21:04.560
who I met practically the first day I got to Harvard.

03:21:04.560 --> 03:21:12.560
And he would always talk about things I didn't understand and I would go home and look them up and try to.

03:21:12.560 --> 03:21:18.560
Anyway, one day we were talking about number forms.

03:21:18.560 --> 03:21:27.560
And number forms are a psychological phenomenon which about 30% of people have.

03:21:27.560 --> 03:21:32.560
And it was first described by Francis Galton.

03:21:32.560 --> 03:21:46.560
And the phenomenon is if I ask you, close your eyes and tell me where is the number three?

03:21:46.560 --> 03:21:52.560
How many of you have a place for the number three?

03:21:52.560 --> 03:21:54.560
Well, that's a few.

03:21:54.560 --> 03:22:04.560
So typically, if you imagine the visual field, that's a windshield, I guess.

03:22:04.560 --> 03:22:23.560
So there are these numbers and they're nowhere in particular except that it's usually like that for an older child.

03:22:23.560 --> 03:22:31.560
So here are these numbers and what's more in some people they're colored.

03:22:31.560 --> 03:22:40.560
So I was talking to Andrew Gleason, I had read this Galton paper which was 1890 or 1885 or something.

03:22:40.560 --> 03:22:44.560
And so I was asking people if they had number forms.

03:22:44.560 --> 03:22:47.560
And he said, oh yes, he has one.

03:22:47.560 --> 03:22:52.560
And he sketched it for me.

03:22:52.560 --> 03:22:56.560
And he said, and they're colored too.

03:22:56.560 --> 03:23:05.560
Oh, and his went way up and the prime numbers were bright.

03:23:05.560 --> 03:23:08.560
What am I doing?

03:23:08.560 --> 03:23:12.560
Maybe the composite numbers were something was bright.

03:23:12.560 --> 03:23:16.560
And they were colored.

03:23:16.560 --> 03:23:26.560
So I wrote this down and I, over the next couple of years, I look in antique stores for old children's blocks.

03:23:26.560 --> 03:23:32.560
And I found a set of blocks that matched that.

03:23:32.560 --> 03:23:39.560
And Andrew Gleason said that he knows when he acquired this thing.

03:23:39.560 --> 03:23:51.560
And it was about four years old and he had a window which in this house and there was a hill.

03:23:51.560 --> 03:23:58.560
And he could just see over the sill and he imagined these numbers on the side of that hill.

03:23:58.560 --> 03:23:59.560
Blah, blah, blah.

03:23:59.560 --> 03:24:08.560
Anyway, people who don't have a number form don't know what I'm talking about.

03:24:08.560 --> 03:24:15.560
And I don't know if the 30% is still true, but it's an interesting phenomenon.

03:24:15.560 --> 03:24:28.560
And in most cases of early childhood, well, that's, you can't find out because children do remember details of a house they lived in,

03:24:28.560 --> 03:24:32.560
but you don't know if they've copied it.

03:24:32.560 --> 03:24:37.560
So what was the original question?

03:24:37.560 --> 03:24:41.560
How much can you remember from infancy?

03:24:41.560 --> 03:24:46.560
Elran Hubbard thought you could go back to before you were born.

03:24:46.560 --> 03:24:58.560
And you could remember people talking about you when you're still in the womb.

03:24:58.560 --> 03:25:01.560
So anyway, John Campbell said you should look into this.

03:25:01.560 --> 03:25:05.560
And a few of us made an expedition.

03:25:05.560 --> 03:25:13.560
We went down to Elizabeth, New Jersey to visit the just starting up Dianetics Center.

03:25:13.560 --> 03:25:22.560
And I met this Elran Hubbard who had green eyes and was quite hypnotic looking.

03:25:23.560 --> 03:25:31.560
And the end of the story is he had been writing about how if you took this treatment of Dianetics,

03:25:31.560 --> 03:25:38.560
then you could memorize an entire newspaper in five minutes and do all sorts of miraculous things like that.

03:25:38.560 --> 03:25:43.560
Once your mind has been cleared of aberrations and obstacles.

03:25:43.560 --> 03:25:48.560
And I became a big industry and turned into later Scientology.

03:25:48.560 --> 03:25:51.560
I'm sure you've all heard about that.

03:25:51.560 --> 03:25:58.560
So we asked Hubbard to look at a newspaper and tell us what was in it.

03:25:58.560 --> 03:26:11.560
And he explained he was so busy training the other people to be cleared that he hadn't had time to go through the procedure himself.

03:26:11.560 --> 03:26:17.560
And I never saw him again.

03:26:17.560 --> 03:26:19.560
Yes?

03:26:19.560 --> 03:26:29.560
What are your thoughts on memes and the fact that we're just, but because our thoughts are actually all about the good.

03:26:29.560 --> 03:26:31.560
Of memes?

03:26:31.560 --> 03:26:38.560
You mean Dawkins?

03:26:38.560 --> 03:26:40.560
I didn't quite get the whole question.

03:26:40.560 --> 03:26:44.560
The idea that...

03:26:44.560 --> 03:26:49.560
So for example the way we talk and the way we all talk,

03:26:49.560 --> 03:26:55.560
how we very much mix the way our parents talk to the people around us.

03:26:55.560 --> 03:26:59.560
And possibly the way we think as well.

03:26:59.560 --> 03:27:03.560
So how does that relate to how our mind develops?

03:27:03.560 --> 03:27:08.560
Are we actually creative original characters?

03:27:08.560 --> 03:27:18.560
Well of course it's both because you learn things from your culture and then you might just mainly repeat things

03:27:18.560 --> 03:27:23.560
or you might get the knack of making new ideas.

03:27:23.560 --> 03:27:30.560
I'm trying to remember what Dawkins main ideas are.

03:27:30.560 --> 03:27:37.560
He invented the word meme to say that

03:27:37.560 --> 03:27:46.560
ideas that people have might be considered to be somewhat similar to the genes in our heredity

03:27:46.560 --> 03:27:57.560
and that societies are systems in which these memes which are conceptual units of meaning or knowledge

03:27:57.560 --> 03:28:04.560
propagate around and self-reproduce and mutate and spread.

03:28:04.560 --> 03:28:16.560
And I don't know what to say about it except that it's obviously true that every now and then someone gets a new idea

03:28:16.560 --> 03:28:22.560
and tells people and for one reason or another they either forget it or tell someone else

03:28:22.560 --> 03:28:32.560
and after a while it spreads and some of them fill up the whole culture and some just die out.

03:28:32.560 --> 03:28:36.560
And whatever else Dawkins says, he's a very smart guy,

03:28:36.560 --> 03:28:45.560
but almost everything then in my mind is that he's explaining that religions are mostly made of these memes

03:28:45.560 --> 03:28:55.560
and they're very bad and cost the world a great deal in progress and productivity.

03:28:55.560 --> 03:29:05.560
In other words, he's a militant atheist and there are about five best sellers in that business today.

03:29:05.560 --> 03:29:14.560
But I don't know what else to say about memes. It's an obviously generally correct idea.

03:29:14.560 --> 03:29:24.560
But the great thing about genes is we know the four amino acids or four nucleic acids they're made of

03:29:24.560 --> 03:29:28.560
and how they're rope together and all that.

03:29:28.560 --> 03:29:37.560
And I don't think Dawkins' theory develops anywhere nearly as elegantly as modern genetics.

03:29:37.560 --> 03:29:49.560
So it would be nice if it could, but a really good theory of good ideas would be nice to have.

03:29:50.560 --> 03:29:55.560
What would it look like?

03:29:55.560 --> 03:29:58.560
Someday we'll have an AI that just punches them out.

03:29:58.560 --> 03:30:02.560
I think it would look like a really good language.

03:30:02.560 --> 03:30:05.560
Oh right.

03:30:05.560 --> 03:30:14.560
Robert Heinlein has some stories in which the super intelligent people have a language that's so dense

03:30:14.560 --> 03:30:20.560
that in five syllables they can explain something that would take you a half hour.

03:30:20.560 --> 03:30:27.560
I think, I forget what it's, log land.

03:30:27.560 --> 03:30:33.560
Anyway, if you need a good idea, read Robert Heinlein.

03:30:33.560 --> 03:30:35.560
Sure.

03:30:35.560 --> 03:30:37.560
I thought you already mentioned this.

03:30:37.560 --> 03:30:48.560
When you talk about how geniuses, they might have just come up with better ways to think better,

03:30:48.560 --> 03:30:58.560
like better ways to think, better ways to learn about how to better learn from better learning.

03:30:58.560 --> 03:31:02.560
But why do you think they never mention it?

03:31:02.560 --> 03:31:12.560
And why hasn't they propagated them better and learning about how better to learn from it?

03:31:12.560 --> 03:31:14.560
That's a great question.

03:31:15.560 --> 03:31:33.560
Do you think people have a concept of an idea that improves better learning?

03:31:33.560 --> 03:31:41.560
There's a couple of phenomena that, like, how come there were so many geniuses in Athens?

03:31:42.560 --> 03:31:58.560
And then some of the best mathematicians came from some high school in some little country next to the Baltic.

03:31:58.560 --> 03:32:00.560
Bulgaria?

03:32:00.560 --> 03:32:02.560
Romania.

03:32:02.560 --> 03:32:08.560
Yes, there was some high school in Romania that not only produced von Neumann,

03:32:08.560 --> 03:32:12.560
but about five or six other world-class mathematicians.

03:32:12.560 --> 03:32:14.560
I don't remember the details.

03:32:14.560 --> 03:32:15.560
So that's a nice question.

03:32:15.560 --> 03:32:26.560
How come, if there are these great memes, how come there aren't more big pockets of them?

03:32:26.560 --> 03:32:34.560
But there are a lot of cultures which were very inventive in other than intellectual fields.

03:32:34.560 --> 03:32:37.560
How come Paris got all those artists?

03:32:37.560 --> 03:32:40.560
How many of you saw the Woody Allen movie?

03:32:40.560 --> 03:32:42.560
What's it called?

03:32:42.560 --> 03:32:47.560
Paris at Midnight?

03:32:47.560 --> 03:32:53.560
So funny.

03:32:53.560 --> 03:32:56.560
Like, would you be able to say no one?

03:32:56.560 --> 03:33:04.560
Say one idea that would improve, you know, your improvement of learning.

03:33:04.560 --> 03:33:06.560
Right.

03:33:06.560 --> 03:33:09.560
That's a good question for each of us.

03:33:09.560 --> 03:33:11.560
What's your very best idea?

03:33:11.560 --> 03:33:19.560
And stop fussing with the other ones and get that one out.

03:33:19.560 --> 03:33:25.560
There must be some people who are very quiet and only speak once in a long time.

03:33:25.560 --> 03:33:28.560
We should watch them carefully.

03:33:28.560 --> 03:33:30.560
Yes?

03:33:30.560 --> 03:33:35.560
I guess along with like, do you ever feel restricted by language?

03:33:35.560 --> 03:33:41.560
Wait.

03:33:41.560 --> 03:33:47.560
It's the sound I can't hear.

03:33:47.560 --> 03:33:54.560
Am I strong enough to lift you?

03:33:54.560 --> 03:33:57.560
I'm sure someone's done it.

03:33:57.560 --> 03:34:00.560
Sorry about that.

03:34:00.560 --> 03:34:11.560
Do you ever feel restricted by language and that you must represent your theory of mind or any theory of language?

03:34:11.560 --> 03:34:12.560
No, I don't.

03:34:12.560 --> 03:34:29.560
But I once was jealous when Papert explained that he got some idea and he explained he gets ideas like that when he thinks in French.

03:34:29.560 --> 03:34:30.560
What?

03:34:30.560 --> 03:34:31.560
You draw pictures too.

03:34:31.560 --> 03:34:32.560
Oh, yeah.

03:34:32.560 --> 03:34:33.560
So it's not just language.

03:34:33.560 --> 03:34:35.560
That's a language.

03:34:35.560 --> 03:34:38.560
Graphics.

03:34:38.560 --> 03:34:50.560
So we ought to have devices within the next few years that draw pictures when you think.

03:34:50.560 --> 03:34:52.560
It's so funny.

03:34:52.560 --> 03:34:55.560
You know, we had cyborgs.

03:34:55.560 --> 03:34:57.560
What were they called?

03:34:57.560 --> 03:34:58.560
I mentioned them last time.

03:34:58.560 --> 03:35:04.560
We had Steve Mann and who's the other one?

03:35:04.560 --> 03:35:06.560
Yeah.

03:35:06.560 --> 03:35:19.560
So there's these two guys around the Media Lab wearing various things on their head and they're always typing and you ask them a question and they've searched Google.

03:35:19.560 --> 03:35:24.560
And when was that?

03:35:24.560 --> 03:35:30.560
1990.

03:35:30.560 --> 03:35:32.560
But it's all gone.

03:35:32.560 --> 03:35:38.560
Nobody walks around with direct connection to the web.

03:35:38.560 --> 03:35:40.560
Yes.

03:35:40.560 --> 03:35:46.560
Anyway, I certainly expected it to turn up and something wrong.

03:35:46.560 --> 03:35:50.560
So anyway, you should be able to buy one one of these days.

03:35:50.560 --> 03:35:54.560
And what's your name?

03:35:54.560 --> 03:36:01.560
Who is that nice woman who had the EEG thing?

03:36:01.560 --> 03:36:06.560
Do you remember a Ted?

03:36:06.560 --> 03:36:07.560
Forgot her name.

03:36:07.560 --> 03:36:15.560
Anyway, she had this sort of helmet which had about 20 electrodes and she induced me to put it on.

03:36:15.560 --> 03:36:21.560
I was on a stage with about a thousand people there, which was rather funny.

03:36:21.560 --> 03:36:34.560
And there's a little spot on a CRT and I get to think about it moving one way or the other and rewarding it when it did the right thing for only about half a minute.

03:36:34.560 --> 03:36:36.560
And then I could steer it around.

03:36:36.560 --> 03:36:46.560
So here was a nice primitive gadget where you could sort of almost draw just by thinking this spot.

03:36:46.560 --> 03:36:53.560
And then she started a company and hasn't sent me one.

03:36:53.560 --> 03:36:56.560
Because maybe it was just beginners luck.

03:36:56.560 --> 03:37:01.560
Beginners luck or something.

03:37:01.560 --> 03:37:02.560
What?

03:37:02.560 --> 03:37:04.560
Her name is Holly.

03:37:04.560 --> 03:37:10.560
Yes, Lee.

03:37:10.560 --> 03:37:15.560
Did you find the company?

03:37:15.560 --> 03:37:21.560
Do you think there would be lots of people wearing stuff?

03:37:21.560 --> 03:37:27.560
With your keyboard, right?

03:37:27.560 --> 03:37:29.560
Why don't we take a five minute break?

03:37:29.560 --> 03:37:50.560
I don't know.

03:37:50.560 --> 03:38:14.560
Well, I hate to interrupt because I see ten different productive discussions.

03:38:14.560 --> 03:38:27.560
I know.

03:38:27.560 --> 03:38:29.560
Yes, I see.

03:38:29.560 --> 03:38:33.560
I saw quite a few apparently productive discussions.

03:38:33.560 --> 03:38:35.560
Maybe that's what the class needs.

03:38:35.560 --> 03:38:41.560
But anybody come to a conclusion?

03:38:41.560 --> 03:38:50.560
Yeah.

03:38:50.560 --> 03:38:55.560
See if you can knock the wall down.

03:38:55.560 --> 03:38:57.560
It's not a conclusion, but it's a question.

03:38:57.560 --> 03:38:58.560
It's a thought experiment.

03:38:58.560 --> 03:39:02.560
So if you had a black box that could sort of replace part of your brain.

03:39:02.560 --> 03:39:06.560
And let's say you could replace like five percent at a time.

03:39:06.560 --> 03:39:08.560
If you assume that there's a self entity.

03:39:08.560 --> 03:39:14.560
At what point would you lose yourself?

03:39:15.560 --> 03:39:33.560
If you change the question is, are you how how much do you have in common with with the you of yesterday as compared to when you graduated grade school?

03:39:33.560 --> 03:39:46.560
So this question of the idea of identity is very, very fuzzy.

03:39:46.560 --> 03:40:15.560
Yeah, I read a science fiction novel by Robert Sawyer.

03:40:15.560 --> 03:40:31.560
And if you know of him, Canadian writer and it has to do with somebody who has a fatal disease.

03:40:31.560 --> 03:40:34.560
So he's going to die soon.

03:40:34.560 --> 03:40:40.560
But the technology is around where you can make a duplicate of him.

03:40:40.560 --> 03:40:50.560
And so he has a duplicate made and he is sent to the moon for some reasons.

03:40:50.560 --> 03:41:04.560
I can't remember, which is a kind of nursing home for I think people who are enfeebled and do much better with one seventh of gravity.

03:41:04.560 --> 03:41:15.560
So there's some reason why anyway the living the original copy is sent to the moon and the substitute takes over.

03:41:15.560 --> 03:41:26.560
But then our hero is miraculously cured by eating the right stem cells or what I don't remember.

03:41:27.560 --> 03:41:36.560
So he wants to come back and the question is who gets the car?

03:41:36.560 --> 03:41:47.560
So I can't remember the title of the novel except that it has alien in it.

03:41:47.560 --> 03:41:56.560
Alienable rights is not something like that, but I wrote an article called alienable rights.

03:41:56.560 --> 03:42:05.560
Anyway, so are you the same as you were five minutes ago or five years ago or whatever?

03:42:05.560 --> 03:42:11.560
And as far as I'm concerned, the answer is who cares?

03:42:11.560 --> 03:42:20.560
It's a sort of silly question because no two things are exactly the same ever anyway.

03:42:20.560 --> 03:42:27.560
But again, a lot of these questions which look philosophical are legal.

03:42:28.560 --> 03:42:44.560
The joke of that novel is that who owns the car is what matters to decide who is the real original and who's the copy.

03:42:44.560 --> 03:42:59.560
Frederick Paul wrote a similar story much longer ago where people are copied and the copy is sent on a one way trip to some planet to fix a broken reactor.

03:42:59.560 --> 03:43:06.560
And they always die and you get a million dollars for providing this copy.

03:43:06.560 --> 03:43:12.560
But one of the copies survives so it's the same plot.

03:43:12.560 --> 03:43:15.560
I can't remember that.

03:43:15.560 --> 03:43:31.560
If you're looking for a good idea, if you go to 1950s science fiction, look for A.E. Van Voter, Frederick Paul or all those wonderful writers.

03:43:31.560 --> 03:43:37.560
That was before it was necessary to describe really good characters.

03:43:37.560 --> 03:43:53.560
And science fiction got better and better for the literary critics and generally worse and worse for the science fiction fans.

03:43:53.560 --> 03:43:56.560
Do we really have any more questions?

03:43:56.560 --> 03:43:58.560
Yes.

03:43:58.560 --> 03:44:08.560
We're in a time age where sharing information between many people on a short amount of time is quite easy.

03:44:08.560 --> 03:44:11.560
Do you think that this will change?

03:44:11.560 --> 03:44:16.560
This will bring up many more ideas. Do you think that this will hinder?

03:44:16.560 --> 03:44:23.560
Because before this time people had problems with sharing information.

03:44:23.560 --> 03:44:29.560
And also now it's touching to hear from a large group of people working on one thing.

03:44:29.560 --> 03:44:35.560
Do you think that this will change the way that we think and do you think that this will make us better?

03:44:35.560 --> 03:44:47.560
It's a tough one. Bad things can happen and good things can happen.

03:44:47.560 --> 03:44:50.560
Funny, because that reminds me again of science fiction.

03:44:50.560 --> 03:45:00.560
Because in science fiction many, many years ago some writers got the idea that there would be something like an internet.

03:45:00.560 --> 03:45:04.560
And some people realized there would be flash crowds.

03:45:04.560 --> 03:45:07.560
And now there are flash crowds.

03:45:07.560 --> 03:45:14.560
And I remember even as a kid talking to people who said,

03:45:14.560 --> 03:45:20.560
why not wire up the voting machines so that they're always there?

03:45:20.560 --> 03:45:27.560
And so if somebody in the government wants to know should we do this or that?

03:45:27.560 --> 03:45:32.560
Should we bomb China or not?

03:45:32.560 --> 03:45:39.560
You could get 100 million people to run up to the keyboard and say yes or no.

03:45:39.560 --> 03:45:46.560
Presumably when the, what do they call those?

03:45:46.560 --> 03:45:56.560
That great crowd of Jeffersons and Franklins and the Founding Fathers did a lot of things to prevent that.

03:45:56.560 --> 03:46:04.560
And the one that they focused on, which was one of the most effective, was called the Electoral College.

03:46:04.560 --> 03:46:11.560
And the United States is different from other places because we don't elect congressmen or presidents.

03:46:11.560 --> 03:46:19.560
We elect smart people from the community who then get together and decide who should be president.

03:46:19.560 --> 03:46:27.560
And of course now if anybody, now they belong to parties and if any of them voted for the other party's candidate,

03:46:27.560 --> 03:46:30.560
they would be held to pay.

03:46:30.560 --> 03:46:40.560
But it was a great idea because the Founding Fathers realized that if you had instant feedback, which is what Hitler got,

03:46:40.560 --> 03:46:47.560
then you could say something really exciting and everybody would press the yes button and then you kill all the Jews.

03:46:47.560 --> 03:46:58.560
And then the next speech you kill all the black people and all the yellow people and all the people whose last name doesn't begin with M.

03:46:58.560 --> 03:47:03.560
And so what you don't want is instant feedback.

03:47:03.560 --> 03:47:08.560
Now the new social networks are getting us close to that.

03:47:08.560 --> 03:47:16.560
And the question is, is it time to have, is it time to stop that?

03:47:16.560 --> 03:47:19.560
Is it getting dangerous? I don't know.

03:47:19.560 --> 03:47:30.560
But there must be a lot of people who are recognizing that this thing is creeping up on us and you might be able to get 50 million people

03:47:30.560 --> 03:47:38.560
to do something reckless in a few minutes if you don't put some limits.

03:47:38.560 --> 03:47:49.560
I don't think we could get the electoral college back because you'd have to get a majority to, what does it take to fix the Constitution?

03:47:49.560 --> 03:47:54.560
Two thirds?

03:47:54.560 --> 03:47:58.560
We'll never see two thirds again.

03:47:58.560 --> 03:48:03.560
It's the end of America.

03:48:03.560 --> 03:48:11.560
Well, we have three minutes.

03:48:11.560 --> 03:48:12.560
Yes?

03:48:12.560 --> 03:48:19.560
If you would design a direction for the field of psychology, obviously one word is a set of debugging tools.

03:48:19.560 --> 03:48:24.560
Why don't you say they should be doing it?

03:48:24.560 --> 03:48:28.560
They should read Patrick Winston's thesis.

03:48:28.560 --> 03:48:41.560
The psychologists now have disappeared into the tar pit of statistics and they don't have the idea that knowledge needs complicated representations.

03:48:41.560 --> 03:48:51.560
And I don't care whether you assign probabilities to them or put them in the order in which you thought of them or, you know,

03:48:51.560 --> 03:49:04.560
or do what Doug Lenet did in his thesis of swapping things when one worked better than another, but I forget the question.

03:49:04.560 --> 03:49:11.560
But I think we've got to get better ideas about representation of knowledge.

03:49:11.560 --> 03:49:26.560
I don't know where they're going to come from now that the whole AI community is drifting into these ways of avoiding representations.

03:49:26.560 --> 03:49:30.560
I haven't read the Norvig, Russell, book.

03:49:30.560 --> 03:49:40.560
Does he, can anybody summarize what it says about knowledge representation?

03:49:40.560 --> 03:49:44.560
Who's read it?

03:49:44.560 --> 03:49:48.560
There's a chapter on logic for sort of logic.

03:49:48.560 --> 03:49:51.560
That's so funny.

03:49:51.560 --> 03:50:05.560
First order of logic is what Newell and Simon thought of in 1956 before they thought of the so-called GPS thing.

03:50:05.560 --> 03:50:07.560
Logic can't make analogies.

03:50:07.560 --> 03:50:13.560
It's a very bad thing to get stuck with.

03:50:13.560 --> 03:50:23.560
Zero or one.

03:50:23.560 --> 03:50:28.560
Maybe one of our papers should be on what should AI do next year.

03:50:28.560 --> 03:50:46.560
So really what my main concern it has been for quite a few years is to make some theory of how,

03:50:46.560 --> 03:50:52.560
what makes people able to solve so many kinds of problems.

03:50:52.560 --> 03:51:00.560
I guess if you ran through the spectrum of all the animals,

03:51:00.560 --> 03:51:06.560
you'd find lots of problems that some animals can solve and people can't,

03:51:06.560 --> 03:51:15.560
like how many of you could build a beaver dam or a termite nest.

03:51:15.560 --> 03:51:21.560
So there are all sorts of things that evolution manages to produce.

03:51:21.560 --> 03:51:34.560
But maybe the most impressive one is what the human infant can do just by hanging around for 10 or 20 or 30 years

03:51:34.560 --> 03:51:39.560
and watching what other humans can do.

03:51:39.560 --> 03:51:42.560
So we can solve all sorts of problems.

03:51:42.560 --> 03:51:52.560
And my quarrel with the rest of the, most of the artificial intelligence community,

03:51:52.560 --> 03:52:03.560
has been that the great success of science in the last 500 years really has been in physics

03:52:03.560 --> 03:52:15.560
and it's been rewarded by finding little sets of rules like Newton's three laws and Maxwell's four laws

03:52:15.560 --> 03:52:29.560
and Einstein's one law or two that explained a huge range of everyday phenomena.

03:52:29.560 --> 03:52:39.560
Of course in the 1920s and 30s that apple cart got upset because actually Einstein himself

03:52:39.560 --> 03:52:51.560
who had discovered the first quantum phenomena, namely the quantization of photons,

03:52:51.560 --> 03:53:00.560
had produced various scientific laboratory observations that were inexplicable

03:53:00.560 --> 03:53:08.560
in terms of either Maxwell or Newton or Einstein's earlier formulations.

03:53:08.560 --> 03:53:16.560
So my picture of the history is that in the 19th century

03:53:16.560 --> 03:53:25.560
and a little bit earlier going back to Locke and Spinoza and Hume and a few of those philosophers, even Immanuel Kant,

03:53:25.560 --> 03:53:29.560
they had some pretty good psychological ideas.

03:53:29.560 --> 03:53:39.560
And as I mentioned the other day, I suspect that Aristotle was more like a modern cognitive psychologist

03:53:39.560 --> 03:53:46.560
and had even better ideas but we've probably lost a lot of them because there are no tape recorders.

03:53:46.560 --> 03:53:58.560
Who knows what Aristotle and Plato said that their students didn't write down because it sounded silly.

03:53:58.560 --> 03:54:13.560
So the idea that we developed around here mostly Seymour Papert and a lot of students,

03:54:13.560 --> 03:54:27.560
Pat Winston was one of the great stars of that period was the idea that to get anything like human intellectual abilities

03:54:27.560 --> 03:54:32.560
you're going to have to have all sorts of high level representations.

03:54:32.560 --> 03:54:43.560
So one has to say the old conditioned reflex of stimulus versus stimulus producing a response isn't good enough.

03:54:43.560 --> 03:54:51.560
The stimulus has to be represented by some kind of semantic structure somewhere in the brain or mind.

03:54:52.560 --> 03:55:07.560
And so far as I know it's only in the theories of not even modern artificial intelligence but the AI of the 60s and 70s and 80s

03:55:07.560 --> 03:55:18.560
that people thought about what could be the internal representation of the kinds of things that we think about.

03:55:19.560 --> 03:55:28.560
And even more important, if one of those representations you see something or you remember some incident

03:55:28.560 --> 03:55:37.560
and your brain represents it in some way and if that way doesn't work you take a breath and you sort of stumble around

03:55:37.560 --> 03:55:40.560
and find another way to represent it.

03:55:40.560 --> 03:55:46.560
Maybe when the original event first happened you represented it in three or four ways.

03:55:46.560 --> 03:55:53.560
And so we're beginning to see, did anybody hear Faroochi's talk?

03:55:53.560 --> 03:56:01.560
The Watson guy was up here a couple of days ago, I missed it,

03:56:01.560 --> 03:56:10.560
but they haven't made a technical publication as far as I know of how this Watson program works

03:56:10.560 --> 03:56:18.560
but it sounds like it's something of an interesting society of mind-like structure and it would be nice if they would...

03:56:18.560 --> 03:56:22.560
Has anybody read any long paper on it?

03:56:22.560 --> 03:56:24.560
There have been a lot of press reports.

03:56:24.560 --> 03:56:26.560
Have you seen anything, Pat?

03:56:28.560 --> 03:56:34.560
So anyway they seem to have done some sorts of common sense reasoning.

03:56:34.560 --> 03:56:43.560
As I said the other day, I doubt that Watson could understand why you can pull something with a string but you can't push.

03:56:43.560 --> 03:56:52.560
And actually I don't know if any existing program can understand that yet.

03:56:53.560 --> 03:57:00.560
I saw some amazing demonstrations yesterday by...

03:57:00.560 --> 03:57:10.560
Or Monday by Steve Wolfram of his Wolfram Alpha,

03:57:10.560 --> 03:57:15.560
which doesn't do much common sense reasoning but it has...

03:57:15.560 --> 03:57:22.560
What it does do is, if you put it in a sentence, it finds five or ten different representations,

03:57:22.560 --> 03:57:25.560
anything you can find that's sort of mathematical.

03:57:25.560 --> 03:57:36.560
And so when you ask it a question it gives you ten answers and it's much better than previous systems because it doesn't...

03:57:36.560 --> 03:57:42.560
Well, Google gives you a quarter million answers but that's too many.

03:57:43.560 --> 03:57:53.560
Anyway, I'm just going to talk a little bit more and just...

03:57:53.560 --> 03:58:00.560
Everybody should be trying to think of a question that the rest of the class might answer.

03:58:00.560 --> 03:58:06.560
So there are lots of different kinds of problems that people can solve going back to the first one,

03:58:06.560 --> 03:58:15.560
like which moving object out there is my mother and which might be a potential threat.

03:58:15.560 --> 03:58:19.560
So there are a lot of kinds of problems that we solve.

03:58:19.560 --> 03:58:33.560
And I've never seen any discussion in psychology books of what are the activities, principal activities of common sense thinking.

03:58:33.560 --> 03:58:41.560
Somehow they don't have...

03:58:41.560 --> 03:58:47.560
Before computers there really wasn't any way to think about high-level thinking

03:58:47.560 --> 03:58:56.560
because there weren't any technically usable ways to describe complicated processes.

03:58:56.560 --> 03:59:07.560
The idea of a conditional expression was barely on the threshold of psychology.

03:59:07.560 --> 03:59:10.560
So what kinds of problems do we have?

03:59:10.560 --> 03:59:20.560
And if you take some particular problem like I find these days I can't get the top off bottles.

03:59:20.560 --> 03:59:22.560
So how do I solve that?

03:59:23.560 --> 03:59:26.560
There are lots of answers.

03:59:26.560 --> 03:59:43.560
One is you look for somebody who looks really strong or you reach into your pocket and you probably have one of these.

03:59:43.560 --> 03:59:45.560
And so on.

03:59:45.560 --> 03:59:54.560
There must be some way to put it on the floor and step on it and kick it with the other foot.

03:59:54.560 --> 03:59:58.560
So there are lots of problems that we're facing every day.

03:59:58.560 --> 04:00:04.560
And if you look in traditional cognitive psychology you're...

04:00:04.560 --> 04:00:06.560
Well, what's the worst theory?

04:00:06.560 --> 04:00:12.560
The worst and the best theory got popular in the 1980s.

04:00:12.560 --> 04:00:20.560
It was called rule-based systems and you just have a big library which says if you have a soda bottle

04:00:20.560 --> 04:00:25.560
and you can't get the cap off then do this or that or the other.

04:00:25.560 --> 04:00:31.560
And so some people decided well that's really all you need.

04:00:31.560 --> 04:00:39.560
Rod Brooks in the 1980s sort of said we don't need those fancy theories

04:00:39.560 --> 04:00:43.560
that people like Minsky and Papert and Winston are working on.

04:00:43.560 --> 04:00:52.560
Why not just say for each situation in the outer world have a rule that says how to deal with that situation?

04:00:52.560 --> 04:00:54.560
Let's make a hierarchy of them.

04:00:54.560 --> 04:01:01.560
And he described a system that sort of looked like the priority interrupt system in a computer.

04:01:01.560 --> 04:01:10.560
And he won all sorts of prizes for this really bad idea that's spread around the world.

04:01:10.560 --> 04:01:13.560
But it solved a lot of problems.

04:01:13.560 --> 04:01:17.560
There are things about priority interrupt that aren't obvious.

04:01:17.560 --> 04:01:20.560
Like suppose you have...

04:01:20.560 --> 04:01:26.560
In the first computers there was some problem because what should you do

04:01:26.560 --> 04:01:30.560
if there are several signals coming into the computer and you want to respond to them.

04:01:30.560 --> 04:01:37.560
And some of the signals are very fast and very short.

04:01:37.560 --> 04:01:47.560
Then you might think well I should give the highest priority to the signal that's going to be there the shortest time.

04:01:47.560 --> 04:01:49.560
Something like that.

04:01:49.560 --> 04:01:57.560
The funny part is that when you made such a system the result was that if you had a computer

04:01:57.560 --> 04:02:02.560
that was responding to some signal that's coming in at a...

04:02:02.560 --> 04:02:07.560
I'm talking about the days when computers were only working at a few kilohertz.

04:02:07.560 --> 04:02:09.560
A few thousand operations a second.

04:02:09.560 --> 04:02:11.560
God that's slow.

04:02:11.560 --> 04:02:16.560
A billion times shorter than what you have in your pocket.

04:02:16.560 --> 04:02:24.560
And if you give priority to the signals that have to be reacted to very fast

04:02:24.560 --> 04:02:30.560
then what happens if you type to those computers it would never see them because it's always...

04:02:30.560 --> 04:02:32.560
I saw this happening once.

04:02:32.560 --> 04:02:41.560
And finally somebody realized that you should give the highest priority to the inputs that come in most...

04:02:41.560 --> 04:02:44.560
least frequently.

04:02:44.560 --> 04:02:51.560
Because otherwise if there's something coming in very frequently you'll just always be responding to it.

04:02:51.560 --> 04:02:56.560
Any of you run into this?

04:02:56.560 --> 04:03:01.560
It took me a while to figure out why.

04:03:01.560 --> 04:03:04.560
Anyway there are lots of kinds of problems.

04:03:04.560 --> 04:03:16.560
And the other day I was complaining that we didn't have enough ways to...

04:03:16.560 --> 04:03:24.560
We had hundreds of words for emotions and here's a couple of dozen.

04:03:24.560 --> 04:03:29.560
There are chapters seven and eight actually most of these.

04:03:29.560 --> 04:03:36.560
So here's a bunch of words for describing ways to think but they're not very technical.

04:03:36.560 --> 04:03:42.560
So you can talk about remorse and sorrow and blah blah blah.

04:03:42.560 --> 04:03:52.560
Hundreds and hundreds of words for feelings and it's a lot of effort to find a dozen words for...

04:03:52.560 --> 04:03:59.560
for intellectual, for what should I call them, problem-solving processes.

04:03:59.560 --> 04:04:08.560
So it's curious to me that the great field called cognitive psychology has not focused in that direction.

04:04:08.560 --> 04:04:18.560
Anyway here's about 20 or 30 of them and you'll find them scattered through chapters seven and eight.

04:04:18.560 --> 04:04:27.560
Here's my favorite one and I don't know of any proper name for it but if you're trying to solve a problem and you're stuck...

04:04:27.560 --> 04:04:36.560
and the example that comes to my mind is if I'm trying to remember someone's name I can tell when it's hopeless.

04:04:36.560 --> 04:04:48.560
And the reason is that for somehow or other I know that there's a huge tree of choices.

04:04:48.560 --> 04:04:59.560
That's one way to represent what's going on and I might know that I'm sure that that letter, that name has a Z in it.

04:04:59.560 --> 04:05:03.560
So you search around and try everything you can.

04:05:03.560 --> 04:05:07.560
But of course it doesn't have a Z.

04:05:07.560 --> 04:05:32.560
So the way to solve that problem is to give up and then a couple of minutes later the name occurs to you and you have no idea how it happened and so forth.

04:05:32.560 --> 04:05:52.560
So anyway the long story is that Papert and I and lots of really great students in the 60s and 70s spent a lot of time making little models of problem solvers that didn't work.

04:05:52.560 --> 04:05:58.560
We discovered that you needed something else and we put that in.

04:05:58.560 --> 04:06:03.560
Other people would come and say that's hopeless.

04:06:03.560 --> 04:06:15.560
You're putting in more things than you need and my conclusion is that wow it's the opposite of physics and physics you're always trying to find.

04:06:15.560 --> 04:06:27.560
You don't want to what is it called Occam's razor never have more structure than you need because because what well it'll waste your time.

04:06:27.560 --> 04:06:35.560
But my feeling was I never have less than you'll need but you don't know how many you'll need.

04:06:35.560 --> 04:06:48.560
So what I did I had four of these and then I forced myself to put in two more and people ask what's the difference between self models and self conscious processes and I don't care.

04:06:48.560 --> 04:06:52.560
What's the difference between self conscious and reflective.

04:06:52.560 --> 04:06:54.560
I don't care.

04:06:54.560 --> 04:07:00.560
And the reason is that wow it's nice to have a box that isn't full yet.

04:07:00.560 --> 04:07:10.560
So if you find something that your previous theory going back to Brooks.

04:07:10.560 --> 04:07:20.560
He was so successful getting simple robots to work that he concluded that the things didn't need any internal representations at all.

04:07:20.560 --> 04:07:31.560
And for some mysterious reason the artificial intelligence society gave him their annual big prize for for this very wrong idea.

04:07:31.560 --> 04:07:41.560
And it caused a research to sort of half collapse in places like Japan and said oh rule based systems is all we need.

04:07:41.560 --> 04:07:45.560
Anybody want to defend him.

04:07:45.560 --> 04:07:53.560
The odd thing is if you talk to Brooks he's one of the best philosophers you'll ever meet and he says oh yes of course that's wrong.

04:07:53.560 --> 04:07:59.560
But it helps people do research and get things done.

04:07:59.560 --> 04:08:13.560
As I think I mentioned the other day when the Three Mile Island thing happened there was no way to get into the reactor.

04:08:13.560 --> 04:08:26.560
That was 1980 and 30 years later when the what's how do you pronounce it Fukushima accident happened.

04:08:26.560 --> 04:08:42.560
There was no robot that could go in and open a door and I don't know who to blame for that maybe us.

04:08:42.560 --> 04:08:48.560
But my picture of the history is that the places that did research on robotics.

04:08:49.560 --> 04:09:00.560
There are quite a few places and for example Carnegie Mellon was very impressive in getting the Sony dogs to play soccer.

04:09:00.560 --> 04:09:11.560
And they're still at it and I think I mentioned that Sony still has a stock of what's it called.

04:09:11.560 --> 04:09:13.560
Say it again.

04:09:13.560 --> 04:09:15.560
FIBO.

04:09:15.560 --> 04:09:17.560
Right.

04:09:17.560 --> 04:09:19.560
I Bose.

04:09:19.560 --> 04:09:22.560
Right.

04:09:22.560 --> 04:09:33.560
But the trouble is they're always broken and we had a there was a robot here called Cog that Brooks made and it sometimes worked.

04:09:33.560 --> 04:09:40.560
But usually it wasn't working and so only one student at a time could experiment with the robot.

04:09:40.560 --> 04:09:47.560
What was that wonderful project of trying to make a walking machine for four years in.

04:09:47.560 --> 04:09:54.560
There was a project to make a robot walk and there was only one of it.

04:09:54.560 --> 04:10:03.560
So first only one student at a time can do research on it and most of the time it's something's broken and you're fixing it.

04:10:03.560 --> 04:10:16.560
And so you end up that you sort of get five or ten hours a week on your laboratory physical robot at the same time.

04:10:16.560 --> 04:10:28.560
Ed Fredkin had a student who tried to make a walking robot and it was a stick figure on the screen and I forgot the student's name.

04:10:28.560 --> 04:10:41.560
But anyway he simulated gravity and a few other things and in a couple of weeks he had a pretty good robot that could walk and go around turns and bank.

04:10:41.560 --> 04:10:57.560
And if you put if you simulated an oily floor it could slip and fall which we considered the high point of the demo actually.

04:10:57.560 --> 04:11:15.560
So anyway I've sort of asked you to read my two books for this course.

04:11:15.560 --> 04:11:22.560
But those are not the only good texts about artificial intelligence.

04:11:22.560 --> 04:11:45.560
If you want to dig deeper it might be a good idea to go to the web and type in Aaron Sloman S L O M A N and you'll get to his website which is something like that.

04:11:45.560 --> 04:11:53.560
And Sloman is a sort of philosopher who can program.

04:11:53.560 --> 04:12:04.560
There are a handful of them in the world and he has lots of interesting ideas that nobody's gotten to carry out.

04:12:04.560 --> 04:12:12.560
And so I recommend.

04:12:12.560 --> 04:12:14.560
Who else is.

04:12:14.560 --> 04:12:25.560
Pat do you ever recommend anyone else.

04:12:25.560 --> 04:12:35.560
I'm trying to think.

04:12:35.560 --> 04:12:38.560
I mean if you're looking for a lot for philosophers.

04:12:38.560 --> 04:12:51.560
Dan Dennett has a lot of ideas but but Sloman is the only person I'd say is a sort of real professional philosopher who tries to program.

04:12:51.560 --> 04:13:00.560
At least some of his ideas and he has successful students who have made larger systems work.

04:13:00.560 --> 04:13:10.560
So if you get tired of me and you ought to then go look at this guy and see who he recommends.

04:13:10.560 --> 04:13:16.560
So OK any who has a good question to ask.

04:13:17.560 --> 04:13:29.560
It's a mystery but.

04:13:29.560 --> 04:13:39.560
I spent most of the couple of days making this list bigger.

04:13:39.560 --> 04:13:49.560
But these aren't you know these are things that you do when you're thinking you make analogies.

04:13:49.560 --> 04:14:02.560
If you have multiple goals you try to pick the most important one or in some cases if you have several goals maybe you should try to achieve the easiest one.

04:14:02.560 --> 04:14:11.560
And there's a chance that it'll lead you into what to do about the harder ones but.

04:14:11.560 --> 04:14:16.560
A lot of people think that mostly in England.

04:14:16.560 --> 04:14:20.560
That logic is a good way to do reasoning.

04:14:20.560 --> 04:14:23.560
And that's completely wrong.

04:14:24.560 --> 04:14:31.560
Because in logic first of all you can't do analogies at all except at a very high level.

04:14:31.560 --> 04:14:41.560
It takes four or five nested quantifiers to say A is to B is C is to which of the following five or.

04:14:42.560 --> 04:14:47.560
So I've never seen anyone do analogical thinking.

04:14:47.560 --> 04:14:55.560
Using formal logic first order or higher order predicate calculus.

04:14:55.560 --> 04:14:57.560
What's logic good for.

04:14:57.560 --> 04:15:00.560
It's great after you've solved a problem.

04:15:00.560 --> 04:15:05.560
Because then you can formalize what you did and see if.

04:15:05.560 --> 04:15:08.560
Some of the things you did weren't necessary.

04:15:08.560 --> 04:15:18.560
In other words after you've got the solution to a problem which you got by going through a big search you finally found a path from A to Z.

04:15:18.560 --> 04:15:22.560
And now you can.

04:15:22.560 --> 04:15:31.560
See if the assumptions that you had to make to bridge all these various little gaps were all essential or not so.

04:15:31.560 --> 04:15:33.560
Yes.

04:15:33.560 --> 04:15:44.560
What example would you say that logic can do analogies like water is for water was like containment or like why.

04:15:44.560 --> 04:15:46.560
Why.

04:15:46.560 --> 04:15:49.560
Well.

04:15:49.560 --> 04:15:52.560
Because you have to make a list of hypotheses.

04:15:52.560 --> 04:15:56.560
And then let me see if I can find Evans.

04:15:56.560 --> 04:16:00.560
The trouble is.

04:16:00.560 --> 04:16:04.560
Don Evans name is in a picture.

04:16:04.560 --> 04:16:08.560
And word can't look inside its pictures.

04:16:08.560 --> 04:16:15.560
Can power can PowerPoint find words in its illustrations.

04:16:15.560 --> 04:16:18.560
Why don't I use PowerPoint.

04:16:18.560 --> 04:16:22.560
Because I've discovered that PowerPoint can't read.

04:16:22.560 --> 04:16:30.560
Pictures made by other programs in the Microsoft Word suite.

04:16:30.560 --> 04:16:34.560
The drawing program in Word is pretty good.

04:16:34.560 --> 04:16:41.560
And then there's an operation in Word which will make a PowerPoint out of what you drew.

04:16:41.560 --> 04:16:45.560
And.

04:16:45.560 --> 04:16:55.560
It's 25 years since Microsoft hasn't fixed the fatal errors that it makes when you do that.

04:16:55.560 --> 04:17:02.560
In other words I don't think that the PowerPoint and Word people communicate and they both make a lot of money.

04:17:02.560 --> 04:17:08.560
So that might be that might be the reason.

04:17:08.560 --> 04:17:14.560
Where was I.

04:17:14.560 --> 04:17:18.560
Well you can do anything in logic if you try hard enough but.

04:17:18.560 --> 04:17:20.560
But.

04:17:20.560 --> 04:17:23.560
A is to be a C is to X.

04:17:23.560 --> 04:17:26.560
Is a four part relation and.

04:17:26.560 --> 04:17:31.560
You'd need a whole pile of quantifiers and.

04:17:31.560 --> 04:17:34.560
How would you know what to do next.

04:17:34.560 --> 04:17:36.560
Yes.

04:17:36.560 --> 04:17:43.560
About the situation in which we are able to perform some sort of action like really fluently and really well.

04:17:43.560 --> 04:17:46.560
But we cannot describe what we're doing.

04:17:46.560 --> 04:17:52.560
And the example I give is say I'm like an expert African drummer from Africa.

04:17:52.560 --> 04:17:54.560
And I can make these like really complicated rhythms.

04:17:54.560 --> 04:17:59.560
But if you ask me what did you just do like I have no idea how to describe it.

04:17:59.560 --> 04:18:04.560
And in that case do you think the person is capable of like.

04:18:04.560 --> 04:18:11.560
Or I guess do you think the person we can say that the person understands this even though they cannot explain it.

04:18:11.560 --> 04:18:13.560
Well.

04:18:13.560 --> 04:18:18.560
But if you take an extreme form of that.

04:18:18.560 --> 04:18:23.560
You can't explain why you used us any particular word for anything.

04:18:23.560 --> 04:18:26.560
There's no reason.

04:18:26.560 --> 04:18:31.560
It's remarkable how well people can do in everyday life.

04:18:31.560 --> 04:18:36.560
To tell people how they got an idea but when you look at it.

04:18:36.560 --> 04:18:40.560
It doesn't say how you would program a machine to do it.

04:18:40.560 --> 04:18:43.560
So something very peculiar about.

04:18:43.560 --> 04:18:48.560
The idea that.

04:18:48.560 --> 04:18:51.560
Goes back to this.

04:18:51.560 --> 04:18:54.560
This idea that people have free will and so forth.

04:18:54.560 --> 04:18:57.560
Suppose I say.

04:18:57.560 --> 04:19:01.560
Look at this and say.

04:19:01.560 --> 04:19:04.560
This has a constriction at this point.

04:19:04.560 --> 04:19:07.560
Why did I say constriction.

04:19:07.560 --> 04:19:11.560
How do you get any how do you decide what word to use for something.

04:19:11.560 --> 04:19:16.560
You have no idea.

04:19:16.560 --> 04:19:19.560
So it's a very general question.

04:19:19.560 --> 04:19:21.560
It's not clear that.

04:19:21.560 --> 04:19:24.560
The different parts of the.

04:19:24.560 --> 04:19:28.560
That the frontal lobes which might have something to do with.

04:19:28.560 --> 04:19:32.560
Making plans and analyzing certain kinds of situations.

04:19:32.560 --> 04:19:35.560
Have any access to what happens in the.

04:19:35.560 --> 04:19:38.560
Broca or what's the.

04:19:38.560 --> 04:19:43.560
What's the speech production area.

04:19:43.560 --> 04:19:47.560
Broca and.

04:19:47.560 --> 04:19:49.560
I'm trying to find the name of the other one.

04:19:49.560 --> 04:19:51.560
It's connected by a cable that's.

04:19:51.560 --> 04:19:55.560
About a quarter inch thick.

04:19:55.560 --> 04:19:57.560
Yeah.

04:19:57.560 --> 04:19:59.560
We have no idea.

04:19:59.560 --> 04:20:01.560
How those work.

04:20:01.560 --> 04:20:04.560
As far as I've never seen.

04:20:04.560 --> 04:20:06.560
Any publication.

04:20:06.560 --> 04:20:08.560
In neuroscience.

04:20:08.560 --> 04:20:12.560
That says here's a theory of what happens in Wernicke's area.

04:20:12.560 --> 04:20:15.560
Have any of you ever seen one.

04:20:15.560 --> 04:20:18.560
What do those people think about.

04:20:18.560 --> 04:20:22.560
But they'll tell you about.

04:20:22.560 --> 04:20:26.560
I was reading something which said it's going to be very hard to understand these areas.

04:20:26.560 --> 04:20:31.560
Because each neuron is connected to a hundred thousand little fibers.

04:20:31.560 --> 04:20:33.560
Well, some of them are.

04:20:33.560 --> 04:20:38.560
And I bet they don't do much except sort of set the bias for.

04:20:38.560 --> 04:20:40.560
Some large.

04:20:40.560 --> 04:20:42.560
Collection of other neurons.

04:20:42.560 --> 04:20:46.560
But.

04:20:46.560 --> 04:20:50.560
But we if you ask somebody how did you think of such a word.

04:20:50.560 --> 04:20:53.560
They will tell you some story or anecdote.

04:20:53.560 --> 04:20:56.560
But they won't be able to describe some sort of procedure.

04:20:56.560 --> 04:20:58.560
Which is.

04:20:58.560 --> 04:21:01.560
Say in terms of a language like Lisbon.

04:21:01.560 --> 04:21:04.560
Say I const this and that and I took the cutter.

04:21:04.560 --> 04:21:07.560
Of this and the car of that and I.

04:21:07.560 --> 04:21:10.560
Put them in this register and then I.

04:21:10.560 --> 04:21:12.560
Swap that with.

04:21:12.560 --> 04:21:15.560
You don't see theories of how the mind works.

04:21:15.560 --> 04:21:18.560
In psychology today.

04:21:18.560 --> 04:21:21.560
The only parts are they know a little bit about.

04:21:21.560 --> 04:21:24.560
Some aspects of vision because you can track.

04:21:24.560 --> 04:21:27.560
The paths of images from the retina to the.

04:21:27.560 --> 04:21:29.560
What to call to the.

04:21:29.560 --> 04:21:32.560
Primary visual cortex and.

04:21:32.560 --> 04:21:37.560
People have been able to figure out what's what some of those cortical columns do.

04:21:37.560 --> 04:21:39.560
And.

04:21:39.560 --> 04:21:42.560
If you go back to an animal like the frog then.

04:21:42.560 --> 04:21:45.560
Researchers like bitsy and others.

04:21:45.560 --> 04:21:49.560
Have figured out how the equivalent of the cerebellum in the frog.

04:21:49.560 --> 04:21:53.560
They've got almost the whole circuit of how.

04:21:53.560 --> 04:21:55.560
When the frog sees a fly.

04:21:55.560 --> 04:22:01.560
It manages to turn its head that way and stick its tongue out and catch it.

04:22:01.560 --> 04:22:03.560
But in the case of a human.

04:22:03.560 --> 04:22:08.560
I've never seen any theory of how any person thinks of anything.

04:22:08.560 --> 04:22:10.560
So.

04:22:10.560 --> 04:22:14.560
There's artificial intelligence which has high level theories of.

04:22:14.560 --> 04:22:18.560
Semantic representations and there's new neuroscience.

04:22:18.560 --> 04:22:25.560
Which has good theories of local some parts of locomotion and some parts of sensory systems.

04:22:25.560 --> 04:22:27.560
And.

04:22:27.560 --> 04:22:30.560
To this day there's nothing much in between.

04:22:30.560 --> 04:22:32.560
So.

04:22:34.560 --> 04:22:39.560
David here has decided to go from one to the other and.

04:22:39.560 --> 04:22:42.560
Former student of mine Bob her and.

04:22:42.560 --> 04:22:44.560
Has done a little bit on both and.

04:22:44.560 --> 04:22:48.560
I bet there are 20 or 30 people around the country who have.

04:22:48.560 --> 04:22:53.560
Trying to bridge the gap between symbolic artificial intelligence and.

04:22:53.560 --> 04:22:56.560
Mapping of the nervous system.

04:22:56.560 --> 04:22:58.560
But.

04:22:58.560 --> 04:23:00.560
It's very rare and.

04:23:00.560 --> 04:23:06.560
I don't know who you could ask to get support to work on a problem like that for five years.

04:23:06.560 --> 04:23:08.560
Yeah.

04:23:08.560 --> 04:23:12.560
Presumably to build a human like artificial intelligence.

04:23:12.560 --> 04:23:13.560
We need to.

04:23:13.560 --> 04:23:17.560
Like we need to perfectly model our own intelligence which means that.

04:23:17.560 --> 04:23:19.560
We're the system.

04:23:19.560 --> 04:23:22.560
We ourselves are the system that we're trying to understand.

04:23:22.560 --> 04:23:24.560
Well it doesn't have to be exact.

04:23:24.560 --> 04:23:26.560
I mean people are different.

04:23:26.560 --> 04:23:29.560
And.

04:23:29.560 --> 04:23:33.560
Typical person has looks like they have 400.

04:23:33.560 --> 04:23:39.560
Different brain centers doing slightly different things are very different things.

04:23:39.560 --> 04:23:40.560
And.

04:23:40.560 --> 04:23:46.560
We have these examples in many cases if you lose a lot of your brain.

04:23:46.560 --> 04:23:51.560
You're very badly damaged and in other cases.

04:23:51.560 --> 04:23:55.560
You recover and become.

04:23:55.560 --> 04:23:57.560
Just about as smart as you were.

04:23:57.560 --> 04:24:02.560
Probably a few cases where you got rid of something that was holding you back but.

04:24:02.560 --> 04:24:05.560
It's hard to prove that.

04:24:05.560 --> 04:24:07.560
So we don't need to.

04:24:07.560 --> 04:24:09.560
We don't need a theory of.

04:24:09.560 --> 04:24:11.560
How people work yet.

04:24:11.560 --> 04:24:15.560
And the nice thing about AI is that.

04:24:15.560 --> 04:24:17.560
We could get we could.

04:24:17.560 --> 04:24:21.560
Eventually get models which are pretty good at solving.

04:24:21.560 --> 04:24:25.560
What people call everyday common sense problems.

04:24:25.560 --> 04:24:26.560
And.

04:24:26.560 --> 04:24:30.560
Probably in many respects they're not the way the human mind works.

04:24:30.560 --> 04:24:32.560
It doesn't matter.

04:24:32.560 --> 04:24:34.560
But once you've got.

04:24:34.560 --> 04:24:38.560
If I had a program which was pretty good at understanding why you can.

04:24:38.560 --> 04:24:42.560
Pull with a string but not push.

04:24:42.560 --> 04:24:45.560
Then there's a fair chance you could say well.

04:24:45.560 --> 04:24:49.560
That seems to resemble what people do I'll do this.

04:24:49.560 --> 04:24:52.560
A few psychological experiments and see.

04:24:52.560 --> 04:24:56.560
What's wrong with that theory and how to change it.

04:24:56.560 --> 04:24:58.560
So at some point.

04:24:58.560 --> 04:25:01.560
There'll be people making AI systems.

04:25:01.560 --> 04:25:04.560
Comparing them to two particular people.

04:25:04.560 --> 04:25:07.560
And trying to make them fit.

04:25:07.560 --> 04:25:10.560
The trouble is nowadays it takes a few months to.

04:25:10.560 --> 04:25:16.560
If you get a really good new idea to program it.

04:25:16.560 --> 04:25:19.560
I think there's something wrong with programming languages.

04:25:19.560 --> 04:25:22.560
And what we need is a.

04:25:22.560 --> 04:25:25.560
We need a programming language which.

04:25:25.560 --> 04:25:27.560
Where the instructions.

04:25:27.560 --> 04:25:30.560
Describe goals and then sub goals.

04:25:30.560 --> 04:25:34.560
And then finally you might say well let's represent.

04:25:34.560 --> 04:25:37.560
This concept by a number or a semantic.

04:25:37.560 --> 04:25:39.560
Network of some sort.

04:25:39.560 --> 04:25:41.560
But.

04:25:41.560 --> 04:25:42.560
Yes.

04:25:43.560 --> 04:25:45.560
Programming.

04:25:45.560 --> 04:25:47.560
Is there a goal oriented language.

04:25:47.560 --> 04:25:48.560
So.

04:25:48.560 --> 04:25:50.560
There's kind of one if you think about it.

04:25:50.560 --> 04:25:52.560
If you swim hard enough.

04:25:52.560 --> 04:25:54.560
Something like SQL.

04:25:54.560 --> 04:25:57.560
Where you tell him here you know I want to find.

04:25:57.560 --> 04:25:59.560
You know the top 10.

04:25:59.560 --> 04:26:02.560
People like my database with this high value.

04:26:02.560 --> 04:26:06.560
And then you don't worry about how the system goes about doing that.

04:26:06.560 --> 04:26:07.560
In a sense that's.

04:26:07.560 --> 04:26:09.560
We're defining the goal when it goes.

04:26:10.560 --> 04:26:15.560
What's it called.

04:26:15.560 --> 04:26:17.560
SQL.

04:26:21.560 --> 04:26:26.560
Oh right yes I guess database query languages are on the track.

04:26:26.560 --> 04:26:27.560
But.

04:26:27.560 --> 04:26:30.560
Wolfram alpha seems.

04:26:30.560 --> 04:26:32.560
To be better than I thought.

04:26:32.560 --> 04:26:37.560
Well he was running it.

04:26:37.560 --> 04:26:39.560
And he.

04:26:39.560 --> 04:26:43.560
Steve Wolfram was giving this demo a meeting we were at.

04:26:43.560 --> 04:26:45.560
On Monday.

04:26:45.560 --> 04:26:48.560
And he'd say well maybe I'll just say this and.

04:26:48.560 --> 04:26:52.560
And it always worked so.

04:26:52.560 --> 04:26:53.560
So maybe.

04:26:53.560 --> 04:26:56.560
Either the language is better than I thought or.

04:26:56.560 --> 04:27:02.560
Wolfram is better than I thought at something.

04:27:02.560 --> 04:27:04.560
Remarkable guy.

04:27:07.560 --> 04:27:08.560
Yes.

04:27:08.560 --> 04:27:09.560
So.

04:27:09.560 --> 04:27:11.560
I like this example of.

04:27:11.560 --> 04:27:13.560
You only remember a game after your.

04:27:13.560 --> 04:27:17.560
You remember a game after you've given up consciously trying to think about it.

04:27:17.560 --> 04:27:21.560
Do you think this is a matter of us being able to set up background.

04:27:21.560 --> 04:27:22.560
Processes and then.

04:27:22.560 --> 04:27:23.560
Either.

04:27:23.560 --> 04:27:26.560
There's some delay like we give up.

04:27:26.560 --> 04:27:29.560
There's some delay in the process or we don't have the ability to correct me.

04:27:29.560 --> 04:27:30.560
Terminate.

04:27:30.560 --> 04:27:31.560
Processes.

04:27:31.560 --> 04:27:34.560
Do you think this only works for memory or could work for.

04:27:34.560 --> 04:27:35.560
Other things.

04:27:36.560 --> 04:27:37.560
Starting.

04:27:42.560 --> 04:27:46.560
Well there's a lot of nice questions about.

04:27:46.560 --> 04:27:52.560
Things like that how many processes can you run at once in your brain and.

04:27:52.560 --> 04:27:55.560
I was having a sort of argument.

04:27:55.560 --> 04:28:00.560
The other day about.

04:28:00.560 --> 04:28:02.560
Music.

04:28:02.560 --> 04:28:04.560
And.

04:28:05.560 --> 04:28:07.560
I was wondering if.

04:28:07.560 --> 04:28:10.560
I see a big difference between Bach and.

04:28:10.560 --> 04:28:12.560
The.

04:28:12.560 --> 04:28:13.560
And.

04:28:13.560 --> 04:28:16.560
The composers who do counterpoint.

04:28:16.560 --> 04:28:17.560
Counterpoint.

04:28:17.560 --> 04:28:22.560
You usually have several versions of a very similar idea.

04:28:22.560 --> 04:28:24.560
Maybe there's one theme.

04:28:24.560 --> 04:28:25.560
And you.

04:28:25.560 --> 04:28:28.560
Have it playing and then another voice comes in.

04:28:28.560 --> 04:28:32.560
And it has that theme upside down or a variation of it.

04:28:32.560 --> 04:28:34.560
In some cases exactly the same.

04:28:34.560 --> 04:28:37.560
And then it's called a cannon.

04:28:37.560 --> 04:28:38.560
And.

04:28:38.560 --> 04:28:42.560
So the tour de force in classical music.

04:28:42.560 --> 04:28:45.560
Is when you have two or three or four.

04:28:45.560 --> 04:28:48.560
Versions of the same thought going on at.

04:28:48.560 --> 04:28:51.560
Once in different times.

04:28:51.560 --> 04:28:53.560
And my feeling was that in.

04:28:53.560 --> 04:28:57.560
Popular music or red.

04:28:57.560 --> 04:29:00.560
If you take it to a typical band.

04:29:00.560 --> 04:29:01.560
Then.

04:29:01.560 --> 04:29:03.560
There might be four people.

04:29:03.560 --> 04:29:06.560
And they're doing different things at the same time.

04:29:06.560 --> 04:29:09.560
Usually not the same.

04:29:09.560 --> 04:29:10.560
Musical tunes.

04:29:10.560 --> 04:29:14.560
But there's a rhythm and there's.

04:29:14.560 --> 04:29:18.560
A timpani and there's various instruments doing different things.

04:29:18.560 --> 04:29:20.560
But there you don't have several doing the same thing.

04:29:20.560 --> 04:29:24.560
I might might be wrong and.

04:29:24.560 --> 04:29:27.560
Somebody said well some some popular music.

04:29:27.560 --> 04:29:29.560
Has a lot of counterpoint.

04:29:29.560 --> 04:29:31.560
I'm just not familiar with it.

04:29:31.560 --> 04:29:33.560
But I think that's.

04:29:33.560 --> 04:29:36.560
If you're trying to solve a hard problem.

04:29:36.560 --> 04:29:40.560
It's fairly easy to look at the problem in several different ways.

04:29:40.560 --> 04:29:46.560
But what's hard is to look at in several almost the same ways that are slightly different.

04:29:46.560 --> 04:29:48.560
Because probably.

04:29:48.560 --> 04:29:54.560
If you believe that the brain is made of agents or resources or whatever.

04:29:54.560 --> 04:29:57.560
You probably don't have duplicate copies of.

04:29:57.560 --> 04:30:00.560
Ones that do important things because.

04:30:00.560 --> 04:30:03.560
That would take up too much real estate.

04:30:03.560 --> 04:30:06.560
Anyway I might be completely wrong about.

04:30:06.560 --> 04:30:10.560
Jazz somebody.

04:30:10.560 --> 04:30:12.560
Maybe they have.

04:30:12.560 --> 04:30:16.560
Just as complicated overlapping things.

04:30:16.560 --> 04:30:17.560
As.

04:30:17.560 --> 04:30:19.560
Buck and.

04:30:19.560 --> 04:30:25.560
The Contrapuntal Composers did but.

04:30:25.560 --> 04:30:26.560
Yeah.

04:30:26.560 --> 04:30:29.560
What is the ultimate goal of artificial intelligence?

04:30:29.560 --> 04:30:33.560
Is it some sort of application or is it more philosophical?

04:30:33.560 --> 04:30:37.560
Oh everyone has different goals or ones.

04:30:37.560 --> 04:30:40.560
In your opinion.

04:30:40.560 --> 04:30:45.560
I think we're going to need it because.

04:30:45.560 --> 04:30:49.560
The disaster that we're working our way toward is that.

04:30:49.560 --> 04:30:51.560
People are going to live longer.

04:30:51.560 --> 04:30:53.560
And.

04:30:53.560 --> 04:30:55.560
They'll become slightly less able.

04:30:55.560 --> 04:30:57.560
And so you'll have.

04:30:57.560 --> 04:31:02.560
Billions of 200 year old people who can barely get around.

04:31:02.560 --> 04:31:06.560
And there won't be enough.

04:31:06.560 --> 04:31:09.560
People to import from underdeveloped countries.

04:31:09.560 --> 04:31:11.560
To.

04:31:11.560 --> 04:31:13.560
Or they won't be able to afford them.

04:31:13.560 --> 04:31:17.560
So we're going to have to have machines that take care of us.

04:31:17.560 --> 04:31:19.560
Of course that's just a transient because.

04:31:19.560 --> 04:31:22.560
At some point then you'll download your brain into.

04:31:22.560 --> 04:31:25.560
A machine and fix everything that's wrong.

04:31:25.560 --> 04:31:28.560
So we'll need robots for a few hundred years.

04:31:28.560 --> 04:31:30.560
Or a few decades and.

04:31:30.560 --> 04:31:35.560
Then we'll be them and we won't need them anymore.

04:31:35.560 --> 04:31:37.560
But it's an important problem.

04:31:37.560 --> 04:31:41.560
What's going to happen in the next hundred years.

04:31:41.560 --> 04:31:44.560
You're going to have.

04:31:44.560 --> 04:31:48.560
Twenty billion two hundred year olds and nobody to take care of them.

04:31:48.560 --> 04:31:58.560
Unless we get a I.

04:31:58.560 --> 04:32:04.560
Nobody seems particularly sad about that.

04:32:04.560 --> 04:32:06.560
How long.

04:32:06.560 --> 04:32:09.560
Oh another anecdote.

04:32:09.560 --> 04:32:12.560
Because once giving a lecture and.

04:32:12.560 --> 04:32:17.560
Talking about people living a long time.

04:32:17.560 --> 04:32:20.560
And nobody in the audience seemed interested in.

04:32:20.560 --> 04:32:23.560
I'd say well suppose you could live 400 years and.

04:32:23.560 --> 04:32:26.560
Most of the people I then I asked what.

04:32:26.560 --> 04:32:30.560
What was the trouble and said wouldn't it be boring.

04:32:30.560 --> 04:32:33.560
So then I tried it again in a couple of other lectures.

04:32:33.560 --> 04:32:35.560
And.

04:32:35.560 --> 04:32:38.560
If you ask a bunch of scientists.

04:32:38.560 --> 04:32:41.560
How would you like to live 400 years.

04:32:41.560 --> 04:32:45.560
Everyone says yay.

04:32:45.560 --> 04:32:47.560
And you ask them why and they say.

04:32:47.560 --> 04:32:49.560
Well I'm working on a problem that.

04:32:49.560 --> 04:32:52.560
I might not have time to solve but if I.

04:32:52.560 --> 04:32:56.560
If I had 400 years I bet I could get somewhere on it.

04:32:56.560 --> 04:32:59.560
And the other people don't have any goal.

04:32:59.560 --> 04:33:03.560
That's my cold-blooded view of the.

04:33:03.560 --> 04:33:07.560
Typical non-scientist.

04:33:07.560 --> 04:33:11.560
There's nothing for them to do in the long run.

04:33:11.560 --> 04:33:14.560
Who can think of what should people do.

04:33:14.560 --> 04:33:17.560
What's your goal.

04:33:17.560 --> 04:33:20.560
How many of you want to live 400 years.

04:33:20.560 --> 04:33:22.560
Wow.

04:33:22.560 --> 04:33:27.560
Must be scientists here.

04:33:27.560 --> 04:33:31.560
Try it on some crowd and let me know what happens.

04:33:31.560 --> 04:33:34.560
Are people really afraid yeah.

04:33:34.560 --> 04:33:37.560
Differentiating factors whether or not you're.

04:33:37.560 --> 04:33:40.560
400 years it's just going to be the repetition.

04:33:40.560 --> 04:33:43.560
Of 100 years experience or that will start to like.

04:33:43.560 --> 04:33:46.560
Take off.

04:33:46.560 --> 04:33:48.560
Well progress.

04:33:48.560 --> 04:33:50.560
Right.

04:33:50.560 --> 04:33:54.560
I've seen 30.

04:33:54.560 --> 04:33:57.560
Issues of the big bang and I don't look forward to.

04:33:57.560 --> 04:33:59.560
The next one anymore because they're all this.

04:33:59.560 --> 04:34:01.560
They're getting to be all the same.

04:34:01.560 --> 04:34:04.560
Well it's the only thing on TV that has.

04:34:04.560 --> 04:34:11.560
Scientists.

04:34:11.560 --> 04:34:17.560
Seriously I hardly read anything except journals and science fiction.

04:34:17.560 --> 04:34:19.560
Because.

04:34:19.560 --> 04:34:21.560
Yeah.

04:34:22.560 --> 04:34:46.560
I can't think of any advantages except that medicine has.

04:34:46.560 --> 04:34:48.560
Isn't getting.

04:34:48.560 --> 04:34:50.560
The the age of.

04:34:50.560 --> 04:34:52.560
Unhandy cap people.

04:34:52.560 --> 04:34:55.560
Went up at one year every four.

04:34:55.560 --> 04:34:58.560
Since the late 1940s.

04:34:58.560 --> 04:35:00.560
So life span is.

04:35:00.560 --> 04:35:04.560
So that's 60 years so people are living 15 years longer.

04:35:04.560 --> 04:35:07.560
On the average then.

04:35:07.560 --> 04:35:09.560
They did when I was born.

04:35:09.560 --> 04:35:11.560
Or even more than that.

04:35:11.560 --> 04:35:14.560
But it's leveled off lately.

04:35:14.560 --> 04:35:18.560
Now I suspect that you only have to fix a dozen genes or.

04:35:18.560 --> 04:35:20.560
Who knows nobody.

04:35:20.560 --> 04:35:22.560
Really has a good estimate.

04:35:22.560 --> 04:35:25.560
But you can probably double the lifespan if you could.

04:35:25.560 --> 04:35:28.560
Fix.

04:35:28.560 --> 04:35:31.560
Nobody knows but maybe there's just a dozen processes that.

04:35:31.560 --> 04:35:34.560
That would fix a lot of things and.

04:35:34.560 --> 04:35:37.560
Then you could live longer without deteriorating.

04:35:37.560 --> 04:35:39.560
And lots of people might.

04:35:39.560 --> 04:35:41.560
Get bored.

04:35:41.560 --> 04:35:44.560
But.

04:35:44.560 --> 04:35:46.560
They'll self select.

04:35:46.560 --> 04:35:49.560
I don't know.

04:35:49.560 --> 04:35:52.560
What's your answer.

04:35:52.560 --> 04:35:55.560
I.

04:35:55.560 --> 04:35:57.560
I hear that.

04:35:57.560 --> 04:35:59.560
Creating I know that.

04:35:59.560 --> 04:36:03.560
And more.

04:36:03.560 --> 04:36:08.560
I mean the goal is not to help take care of people but to compliment.

04:36:08.560 --> 04:36:11.560
What we already have.

04:36:11.560 --> 04:36:16.560
You could also look at them as our descendants and.

04:36:16.560 --> 04:36:19.560
They we will have them replace us.

04:36:19.560 --> 04:36:22.560
And.

04:36:22.560 --> 04:36:27.560
Just as a lot of people consider their children to be.

04:36:27.560 --> 04:36:30.560
The next generation of them.

04:36:30.560 --> 04:36:33.560
And I know a lot of people who don't.

04:36:33.560 --> 04:36:34.560
So it's.

04:36:34.560 --> 04:36:37.560
It's not a universal.

04:36:37.560 --> 04:36:43.560
But.

04:36:43.560 --> 04:36:50.560
What's the point of anything I don't want to get in.

04:36:50.560 --> 04:36:56.560
We might be the only intelligent life in the universe and.

04:36:56.560 --> 04:36:59.560
In that case it's very important that we.

04:36:59.560 --> 04:37:01.560
Solve all our problems and make sure.

04:37:01.560 --> 04:37:05.560
That something intelligent persists.

04:37:05.560 --> 04:37:11.560
Carl Sagan had some argument of that sort.

04:37:11.560 --> 04:37:14.560
If you were sure that there were lots of others.

04:37:14.560 --> 04:37:15.560
Then.

04:37:15.560 --> 04:37:25.560
Then it wouldn't seem so important.

04:37:25.560 --> 04:37:29.560
Who's the new Carl Sagan.

04:37:29.560 --> 04:37:32.560
Is there any who's the who's the note.

04:37:32.560 --> 04:37:36.560
Is there a public scientist.

04:37:36.560 --> 04:37:40.560
Who.

04:37:40.560 --> 04:37:44.560
All the time.

04:37:44.560 --> 04:37:48.560
Tyson.

04:37:48.560 --> 04:37:50.560
He's very good.

04:37:50.560 --> 04:37:56.560
Tyson is the astrophysicist.

04:37:56.560 --> 04:37:59.560
Brian Green is a great actor.

04:37:59.560 --> 04:38:04.560
Quite impressive.

04:38:04.560 --> 04:38:06.560
Yeah.

04:38:06.560 --> 04:38:27.560
Machine.

04:38:27.560 --> 04:38:30.560
Well I think that's a funny question because.

04:38:30.560 --> 04:38:32.560
If we're programming it.

04:38:32.560 --> 04:38:36.560
We can make sure that the machine has a.

04:38:36.560 --> 04:38:38.560
Very good.

04:38:38.560 --> 04:38:39.560
Abstract.

04:38:39.560 --> 04:38:42.560
But correct model of how it works.

04:38:42.560 --> 04:38:44.560
Which people don't.

04:38:44.560 --> 04:38:46.560
So people have a sense of self.

04:38:46.560 --> 04:38:49.560
But it's only a sense of self and it's.

04:38:49.560 --> 04:38:51.560
It's just plain wrong in almost every.

04:38:51.560 --> 04:38:53.560
Every respect.

04:38:53.560 --> 04:38:55.560
And.

04:38:55.560 --> 04:38:59.560
So it's a really funny question because.

04:38:59.560 --> 04:39:01.560
When you make a machine.

04:39:01.560 --> 04:39:03.560
That really has a.

04:39:03.560 --> 04:39:06.560
Good useful representation of.

04:39:06.560 --> 04:39:08.560
What it is and how it works.

04:39:08.560 --> 04:39:10.560
It might be quite different.

04:39:10.560 --> 04:39:13.560
Have different attitudes than a person does.

04:39:13.560 --> 04:39:17.560
Like it might not consider itself very valuable and say.

04:39:17.560 --> 04:39:22.560
It's a oh I could make something that's even better than me and jump into that.

04:39:22.560 --> 04:39:25.560
And so it wouldn't have the.

04:39:25.560 --> 04:39:28.560
It might not have any self protective.

04:39:28.560 --> 04:39:31.560
Reaction because.

04:39:31.560 --> 04:39:35.560
If you could improve yourself then you don't want not to.

04:39:35.560 --> 04:39:39.560
Whereas we're in a state where there's nothing much we can do except.

04:39:39.560 --> 04:39:42.560
Try to keep living and.

04:39:42.560 --> 04:39:45.560
We don't have any alternative.

04:39:45.560 --> 04:39:46.560
If.

04:39:46.560 --> 04:39:48.560
Stupid.

04:39:48.560 --> 04:39:53.560
Thing to say.

04:39:53.560 --> 04:39:56.560
I can't imagine getting tired of living but.

04:39:56.560 --> 04:40:02.560
Lots of people do.

04:40:02.560 --> 04:40:04.560
Yeah.

04:40:04.560 --> 04:40:07.560
Think about creative thinking and the way of thinking and.

04:40:07.560 --> 04:40:09.560
Where does this.

04:40:09.560 --> 04:40:15.560
I had a little section about that somewhere that I wrote.

04:40:15.560 --> 04:40:23.560
Which was the difference between artists and scientists or engineers and.

04:40:23.560 --> 04:40:25.560
Engineers are in.

04:40:25.560 --> 04:40:28.560
Have a very nice situation because.

04:40:28.560 --> 04:40:30.560
They know what they want.

04:40:30.560 --> 04:40:34.560
Because somebody's ordered them to make a.

04:40:34.560 --> 04:40:39.560
In the last month three times I've walked away.

04:40:39.560 --> 04:40:44.560
From my computer and.

04:40:44.560 --> 04:40:48.560
How many of you have a Mac with the magnetic.

04:40:48.560 --> 04:40:51.560
Thing.

04:40:51.560 --> 04:40:59.560
And three times I pulled it with by tripping on this and it fell to the floor and didn't break.

04:40:59.560 --> 04:41:03.560
And I've had Max for 20 odd years or since 1980.

04:41:03.560 --> 04:41:08.560
When did they start.

04:41:08.560 --> 04:41:12.560
30 years and.

04:41:12.560 --> 04:41:16.560
They used to they have the regular jack power supply in the old days.

04:41:16.560 --> 04:41:21.560
And I don't remember and usually when you pull the cord it comes out.

04:41:21.560 --> 04:41:25.560
Here's this cord that Steve Jobs and everybody designed.

04:41:25.560 --> 04:41:33.560
Very carefully so that when you pull it nothing bad would happen.

04:41:33.560 --> 04:41:37.560
But it does.

04:41:37.560 --> 04:41:40.560
How do you account for that.

04:41:40.560 --> 04:41:45.560
Yeah.

04:41:45.560 --> 04:41:48.560
Yeah.

04:41:48.560 --> 04:41:50.560
Well it's quite a wide angle.

04:41:50.560 --> 04:42:01.560
Yeah.

04:42:01.560 --> 04:42:05.560
Well what it needs is a little ramp so that it would slide out.

04:42:05.560 --> 04:42:11.560
I mean it would only take a minute to file it down so that it would slide out.

04:42:11.560 --> 04:42:14.560
But they didn't.

04:42:14.560 --> 04:42:21.560
I forget why I mentioned that but.

04:42:21.560 --> 04:42:22.560
Right.

04:42:22.560 --> 04:42:24.560
So what's the difference between an artist and engineer.

04:42:24.560 --> 04:42:27.560
Well when you do a painting.

04:42:27.560 --> 04:42:30.560
It seems to me if you're already good at painting.

04:42:30.560 --> 04:42:35.560
The nine tenths of the problem is what should I paint.

04:42:35.560 --> 04:42:38.560
So you can think of an artist as.

04:42:38.560 --> 04:42:44.560
10% skill and 90% trying to figure out what the problem is to solve.

04:42:44.560 --> 04:42:46.560
Whereas for the engineer.

04:42:46.560 --> 04:42:51.560
Somebody's told him what to do make a better cable connector.

04:42:51.560 --> 04:42:56.560
And so he's going to spend 90% of his time actually solving the problem.

04:42:56.560 --> 04:42:59.560
And only 10% of the time.

04:42:59.560 --> 04:43:02.560
Trying to decide what problem to solve.

04:43:02.560 --> 04:43:06.560
So I don't see any difference between artists and engineers.

04:43:06.560 --> 04:43:09.560
Except that.

04:43:09.560 --> 04:43:14.560
The artist has more problems to solve than it could possibly solve.

04:43:14.560 --> 04:43:17.560
And usually ends up by picking a really dumb one.

04:43:17.560 --> 04:43:18.560
Like.

04:43:18.560 --> 04:43:21.560
Let's have a saint in three angels.

04:43:21.560 --> 04:43:25.560
Where will I put the third angel.

04:43:25.560 --> 04:43:31.560
The engineering part.

04:43:31.560 --> 04:43:35.560
Just just improvising.

04:43:35.560 --> 04:43:36.560
So.

04:43:36.560 --> 04:43:39.560
To me the media lab makes sense.

04:43:39.560 --> 04:43:43.560
The artists and were semi artists and the scientists.

04:43:43.560 --> 04:43:46.560
Are doing almost the same thing.

04:43:46.560 --> 04:43:49.560
And if you look at the more arty people.

04:43:49.560 --> 04:43:53.560
They're a little more concerned with human social relations and.

04:43:54.560 --> 04:43:57.560
And others are more concerned with.

04:43:57.560 --> 04:44:01.560
Very technical specific aspects of signal processing or.

04:44:01.560 --> 04:44:04.560
Semantic representations.

04:44:04.560 --> 04:44:05.560
So what.

04:44:05.560 --> 04:44:06.560
But.

04:44:06.560 --> 04:44:08.560
So I don't see much difference.

04:44:08.560 --> 04:44:12.560
Between the arts and the sciences.

04:44:12.560 --> 04:44:14.560
And then.

04:44:14.560 --> 04:44:17.560
Of course the great moments are when you run into.

04:44:17.560 --> 04:44:20.560
People like Leonardo and Michelangelo who.

04:44:21.560 --> 04:44:25.560
Get some idea that requires a great new technical.

04:44:25.560 --> 04:44:26.560
Innovation that.

04:44:26.560 --> 04:44:29.560
Nobody it's ever done and.

04:44:29.560 --> 04:44:31.560
It's hard to separate them.

04:44:31.560 --> 04:44:34.560
I think there's some place where Leonardo.

04:44:34.560 --> 04:44:38.560
Realizes that the lens in the eye would mean.

04:44:38.560 --> 04:44:40.560
That the image is upside down.

04:44:40.560 --> 04:44:43.560
On the retina and he couldn't stand that.

04:44:43.560 --> 04:44:45.560
So there's a diagram he has.

04:44:45.560 --> 04:44:47.560
Where the corny is curved enough.

04:44:47.560 --> 04:44:49.560
To invert the image.

04:44:49.560 --> 04:44:54.560
And then the lens inverts it back again.

04:44:54.560 --> 04:44:58.560
Which is contrary to fact with.

04:44:58.560 --> 04:45:02.560
He has a sketch showing that he was worried about.

04:45:02.560 --> 04:45:03.560
If.

04:45:03.560 --> 04:45:06.560
If the image were upside down on the retina.

04:45:06.560 --> 04:45:08.560
Wouldn't things look upside down.

04:45:08.560 --> 04:45:09.560
But.

04:45:14.560 --> 04:45:16.560
Yeah.

04:45:16.560 --> 04:45:18.560
I don't know if they have a question.

04:45:18.560 --> 04:45:20.560
Did you ever heard of.

04:45:20.560 --> 04:45:22.560
Hiring.

04:45:22.560 --> 04:45:23.560
High air.

04:45:23.560 --> 04:45:25.560
Temporal memory.

04:45:25.560 --> 04:45:27.560
Temporal.

04:45:27.560 --> 04:45:29.560
Temporal memory.

04:45:29.560 --> 04:45:30.560
Like.

04:45:30.560 --> 04:45:32.560
There's a system that I've had.

04:45:32.560 --> 04:45:33.560
Right.

04:45:33.560 --> 04:45:34.560
That's right.

04:45:34.560 --> 04:45:35.560
Great.

04:45:35.560 --> 04:45:36.560
That's right.

04:45:36.560 --> 04:45:37.560
How.

04:45:37.560 --> 04:45:38.560
Great.

04:45:38.560 --> 04:45:40.560
Requires them.

04:45:40.560 --> 04:45:42.560
They have a company called.

04:45:42.560 --> 04:45:44.560
And they're going to release.

04:45:44.560 --> 04:45:46.560
At the end of this year.

04:45:46.560 --> 04:45:47.560
On it.

04:45:47.560 --> 04:45:49.560
And there's like some research.

04:45:49.560 --> 04:45:52.560
They have paper.

04:45:52.560 --> 04:45:55.560
Well, I'm not sure what.

04:45:55.560 --> 04:45:57.560
This is Jeff Hawkins project.

04:45:57.560 --> 04:45:58.560
I don't know.

04:45:58.560 --> 04:46:00.560
Yes.

04:46:00.560 --> 04:46:04.560
I haven't heard about 10 years ago he said Hawkins.

04:46:04.560 --> 04:46:05.560
Yeah.

04:46:05.560 --> 04:46:06.560
Hawkins.

04:46:06.560 --> 04:46:07.560
Yeah.

04:46:07.560 --> 04:46:09.560
Well he was talking about 10 years ago how.

04:46:09.560 --> 04:46:12.560
Great it was and I haven't heard a word of any progress.

04:46:12.560 --> 04:46:15.560
Is there some.

04:46:15.560 --> 04:46:18.560
Anybody heard it.

04:46:18.560 --> 04:46:20.560
There's a couple of books about it but.

04:46:20.560 --> 04:46:25.560
I've never seen any claim of that it works.

04:46:25.560 --> 04:46:29.560
They wrote a ferocious review of the society of mind.

04:46:29.560 --> 04:46:30.560
In.

04:46:30.560 --> 04:46:32.560
Which came out in 1986.

04:46:32.560 --> 04:46:35.560
And.

04:46:35.560 --> 04:46:39.560
The Hawkins group existed then and had this.

04:46:39.560 --> 04:46:44.560
Talk about a hierarchical memory system.

04:46:44.560 --> 04:46:47.560
But.

04:46:47.560 --> 04:46:51.560
So if I can tell it's all bluff nothing happened.

04:46:51.560 --> 04:46:53.560
I've never seen a report.

04:46:53.560 --> 04:46:57.560
That they have a machine which solved the problem.

04:46:57.560 --> 04:46:59.560
Let me know if you find one.

04:46:59.560 --> 04:47:03.560
Because.

04:47:03.560 --> 04:47:06.560
Oh well.

04:47:06.560 --> 04:47:10.560
Hawkins got really mad at me for pointing this out.

04:47:10.560 --> 04:47:12.560
But.

04:47:12.560 --> 04:47:14.560
I was really mad at him for.

04:47:14.560 --> 04:47:15.560
Having four of his.

04:47:15.560 --> 04:47:19.560
Assistants write a bad book review of my book so.

04:47:19.560 --> 04:47:26.560
I hope we were even.

04:47:26.560 --> 04:47:33.560
If anybody can find out whether I forget what it's called you remember its name.

04:47:34.560 --> 04:47:37.560
The game.

04:47:37.560 --> 04:47:42.560
Well let's find out if it can do anything yet.

04:47:42.560 --> 04:47:47.560
Hawkins is wealthy enough to support it for a long time so.

04:47:47.560 --> 04:47:55.560
It should be good by now.

04:47:55.560 --> 04:47:59.560
Yes.

04:47:59.560 --> 04:48:02.560
People first start out with some sort of.

04:48:02.560 --> 04:48:06.560
Classification in their head of the kind of problem it is for.

04:48:06.560 --> 04:48:08.560
Is that not necessary.

04:48:08.560 --> 04:48:10.560
Yes.

04:48:10.560 --> 04:48:12.560
That's.

04:48:12.560 --> 04:48:16.560
Well.

04:48:16.560 --> 04:48:20.560
There's this huge book called human problem solving.

04:48:20.560 --> 04:48:22.560
Which was.

04:48:22.560 --> 04:48:24.560
I don't know how many of you know.

04:48:24.560 --> 04:48:26.560
The names of Newell and Simon.

04:48:26.560 --> 04:48:30.560
Originally was Newell Shaw and Simon.

04:48:30.560 --> 04:48:32.560
And in the.

04:48:32.560 --> 04:48:35.560
Believe it or not in the late 1950s.

04:48:35.560 --> 04:48:37.560
They did some of the first.

04:48:37.560 --> 04:48:41.560
Really productive AI research.

04:48:41.560 --> 04:48:43.560
And.

04:48:43.560 --> 04:48:45.560
Then I think.

04:48:45.560 --> 04:48:47.560
In 1970.

04:48:47.560 --> 04:48:49.560
So that's.

04:48:49.560 --> 04:48:53.560
After 12 years of.

04:48:53.560 --> 04:48:56.560
Discovering interesting things.

04:48:56.560 --> 04:48:58.560
Their main discovery was.

04:48:58.560 --> 04:49:01.560
The gadget that they called GPS.

04:49:01.560 --> 04:49:04.560
Which is not global positioning satellite but.

04:49:04.560 --> 04:49:07.560
General problem solver.

04:49:07.560 --> 04:49:09.560
And.

04:49:09.560 --> 04:49:11.560
You can look it up in the index.

04:49:11.560 --> 04:49:13.560
Of my book and there's a sort of.

04:49:13.560 --> 04:49:16.560
One or two page description.

04:49:16.560 --> 04:49:19.560
If you ever get some spare time.

04:49:19.560 --> 04:49:21.560
Search the web for their early.

04:49:21.560 --> 04:49:24.560
Early paper by Newell and Simon on.

04:49:24.560 --> 04:49:27.560
How GPS worked because it's really fascinating.

04:49:27.560 --> 04:49:31.560
What it did is it looked at a problem and found some features of it.

04:49:31.560 --> 04:49:35.560
And then looked up in a table saying that.

04:49:35.560 --> 04:49:39.560
If there's this difference between what you have and what you.

04:49:39.560 --> 04:49:40.560
Want.

04:49:40.560 --> 04:49:42.560
Use such and such a method.

04:49:42.560 --> 04:49:44.560
So it was so what I called it.

04:49:44.560 --> 04:49:46.560
We named it a difference engine.

04:49:46.560 --> 04:49:48.560
As a sort of joke.

04:49:48.560 --> 04:49:50.560
Because the first computer.

04:49:50.560 --> 04:49:53.560
In history was.

04:49:53.560 --> 04:49:56.560
The one called the difference engine but.

04:49:56.560 --> 04:49:58.560
It was for.

04:49:58.560 --> 04:50:00.560
Predicting tides and things.

04:50:00.560 --> 04:50:01.560
Anyway.

04:50:01.560 --> 04:50:03.560
They did some beautiful work.

04:50:03.560 --> 04:50:05.560
And there's this big book.

04:50:05.560 --> 04:50:07.560
Which I think is about 1970.

04:50:07.560 --> 04:50:09.560
Called human problem solving.

04:50:09.560 --> 04:50:11.560
And.

04:50:11.560 --> 04:50:13.560
What they did is.

04:50:13.560 --> 04:50:15.560
Got some people to solve problems.

04:50:15.560 --> 04:50:19.560
And they trained the people to talk while they're solving the problem.

04:50:19.560 --> 04:50:26.560
So some of them were little cryptograms like.

04:50:26.560 --> 04:50:30.560
If each letter stands for.

04:50:30.560 --> 04:50:34.560
For a digit.

04:50:34.560 --> 04:50:37.560
I've forgotten it.

04:50:37.560 --> 04:50:41.560
Pat, do you remember the name one of those problems.

04:50:41.560 --> 04:50:44.560
John plus Joe.

04:50:44.560 --> 04:50:48.560
John plus Jane equals Robert or something.

04:50:48.560 --> 04:50:51.560
That I'm sure that has no solution.

04:50:51.560 --> 04:50:54.560
But those are called crypt arithmetic.

04:50:54.560 --> 04:50:58.560
And so they had dozens or hundreds of people.

04:50:58.560 --> 04:51:02.560
Who would be trained to talk aloud while they're solving.

04:51:02.560 --> 04:51:04.560
Little puzzles like that.

04:51:04.560 --> 04:51:05.560
And then.

04:51:05.560 --> 04:51:07.560
What they did was.

04:51:07.560 --> 04:51:11.560
Get exactly what the people said and how long they took and.

04:51:11.560 --> 04:51:14.560
In some cases where they moved their eyes.

04:51:14.560 --> 04:51:16.560
They had an eye tracking machine.

04:51:16.560 --> 04:51:18.560
And then they wrote programs.

04:51:18.560 --> 04:51:24.560
That showed how this guy solved a couple of these crypt arithmetic problems.

04:51:24.560 --> 04:51:26.560
Then they ran the program on a new one.

04:51:26.560 --> 04:51:30.560
And in some rare cases it actually solved the.

04:51:30.560 --> 04:51:33.560
The other problem so this is a book.

04:51:33.560 --> 04:51:35.560
Which.

04:51:35.560 --> 04:51:39.560
Looks at human behavior and makes a theory of what it's doing.

04:51:39.560 --> 04:51:41.560
And the output is a rule based system.

04:51:41.560 --> 04:51:43.560
So it's.

04:51:43.560 --> 04:51:45.560
It's not a very exciting theory, but.

04:51:45.560 --> 04:51:47.560
But.

04:51:47.560 --> 04:51:50.560
There had never been anything like it.

04:51:50.560 --> 04:51:51.560
Inside.

04:51:51.560 --> 04:51:56.560
You know, it was like Pavlov discovering conditioned reflexes for rats.

04:51:56.560 --> 04:51:57.560
Or dogs.

04:51:57.560 --> 04:51:59.560
And Newland Simon.

04:51:59.560 --> 04:52:01.560
Discovering some.

04:52:01.560 --> 04:52:04.560
Rather higher level.

04:52:05.560 --> 04:52:07.560
Almost a Rodney Brooks like system.

04:52:07.560 --> 04:52:12.560
For how humans solve some problems that most people find pretty hard.

04:52:12.560 --> 04:52:13.560
See.

04:52:13.560 --> 04:52:15.560
Anyway.

04:52:21.560 --> 04:52:24.560
What there hasn't been as much.

04:52:24.560 --> 04:52:27.560
I don't know of any follow up they spent years.

04:52:27.560 --> 04:52:30.560
Perfecting those experiments and.

04:52:30.560 --> 04:52:32.560
Writing about.

04:52:32.560 --> 04:52:34.560
Results.

04:52:34.560 --> 04:52:36.560
And.

04:52:38.560 --> 04:52:40.560
Anybody know anything like that.

04:52:40.560 --> 04:52:44.560
What psychology is to try to make.

04:52:44.560 --> 04:52:48.560
Real models of real people solving.

04:52:48.560 --> 04:52:50.560
Point problems.

04:52:53.560 --> 04:52:55.560
My.

04:53:01.560 --> 04:53:04.560
It has a green light.

04:53:04.560 --> 04:53:07.560
It has a green light, but the switch was up.

04:53:07.560 --> 04:53:09.560
Boo.

04:53:09.560 --> 04:53:12.560
Oh, it doesn't.

04:53:12.560 --> 04:53:14.560
Yes.

04:53:14.560 --> 04:53:16.560
Did that study.

04:53:16.560 --> 04:53:17.560
Try and see when.

04:53:17.560 --> 04:53:20.560
A person gave up on a particular problem solving method.

04:53:20.560 --> 04:53:24.560
How they switched another which one is which to based on.

04:53:24.560 --> 04:53:27.560
It has it has inexplicable.

04:53:27.560 --> 04:53:28.560
Points at which.

04:53:29.560 --> 04:53:32.560
The person suddenly gives up on that representation.

04:53:32.560 --> 04:53:35.560
And he says, oh, well, I guess.

04:53:35.560 --> 04:53:38.560
I guess are must be three.

04:53:41.560 --> 04:53:44.560
Did I erase well.

04:53:44.560 --> 04:53:46.560
Yes, it's got episodes.

04:53:46.560 --> 04:53:49.560
And they can't account for the.

04:53:49.560 --> 04:53:51.560
These little jerks in the script.

04:53:51.560 --> 04:53:54.560
Where the model changes.

04:53:54.560 --> 04:53:56.560
And.

04:53:56.560 --> 04:53:58.560
Sorry.

04:53:58.560 --> 04:54:01.560
And they announced those to be mysteries.

04:54:01.560 --> 04:54:03.560
And say, here's a place where the.

04:54:03.560 --> 04:54:06.560
Person has decided the strategy isn't working.

04:54:06.560 --> 04:54:11.560
And starts over or is changing something.

04:54:11.560 --> 04:54:14.560
The amazing part is that their model.

04:54:14.560 --> 04:54:17.560
Sometimes fits what the person says.

04:54:17.560 --> 04:54:20.560
For 50 or even 100 steps.

04:54:20.560 --> 04:54:23.560
The guy saying, oh, I think two must be.

04:54:23.560 --> 04:54:27.560
Z must be two and P must be seven.

04:54:27.560 --> 04:54:30.560
And that means he plus he is nine.

04:54:30.560 --> 04:54:32.560
And I wonder what's nine.

04:54:32.560 --> 04:54:34.560
And.

04:54:34.560 --> 04:54:38.560
So their model fits for very long.

04:54:38.560 --> 04:54:43.560
Strings maybe two minutes of the person mumbling.

04:54:43.560 --> 04:54:45.560
To themselves.

04:54:45.560 --> 04:54:47.560
And then.

04:54:47.560 --> 04:54:48.560
It breaks and then.

04:54:48.560 --> 04:54:51.560
Is another sequence.

04:54:51.560 --> 04:54:54.560
So new will actually spent.

04:54:54.560 --> 04:55:00.560
More than a year after doing it verbally.

04:55:00.560 --> 04:55:03.560
At tracking the person's eye motions.

04:55:03.560 --> 04:55:07.560
And trying to correlate the person's eye motions with.

04:55:07.560 --> 04:55:10.560
What the person was talking about.

04:55:10.560 --> 04:55:12.560
And guess what.

04:55:12.560 --> 04:55:15.560
None.

04:55:15.560 --> 04:55:17.560
It was almost as though.

04:55:17.560 --> 04:55:19.560
You look at something.

04:55:19.560 --> 04:55:22.560
And then to think about it, you look away.

04:55:22.560 --> 04:55:25.560
It was a.

04:55:25.560 --> 04:55:27.560
Newell was quite distressed because.

04:55:27.560 --> 04:55:29.560
He spent about a year.

04:55:29.560 --> 04:55:32.560
Crawling over this data trying to.

04:55:32.560 --> 04:55:36.560
Figure out what kinds of mental events caused the eyes to.

04:55:36.560 --> 04:55:38.560
Change what they were looking at.

04:55:38.560 --> 04:55:42.560
But when the problem got hard, you would look at a blank part of the thing more.

04:55:42.560 --> 04:55:44.560
More often than.

04:55:44.560 --> 04:55:46.560
The place where the problem.

04:55:46.560 --> 04:55:48.560
Turned up.

04:55:48.560 --> 04:55:51.560
So conclusion.

04:55:51.560 --> 04:55:54.560
That didn't work.

04:55:54.560 --> 04:55:57.560
When I was a very young.

04:55:57.560 --> 04:56:00.560
Student in college I had a.

04:56:00.560 --> 04:56:03.560
Friend named Marcus Singer who.

04:56:03.560 --> 04:56:06.560
Was trying to figure out how the.

04:56:06.560 --> 04:56:10.560
Nerve in the four limb of a frog worked.

04:56:10.560 --> 04:56:15.560
And so he was operating on tadpoles and.

04:56:16.560 --> 04:56:18.560
He spent about six weeks.

04:56:18.560 --> 04:56:21.560
Moving this sciatic nerve.

04:56:21.560 --> 04:56:24.560
From the leg up to the arm.

04:56:24.560 --> 04:56:26.560
Of this tadpole.

04:56:26.560 --> 04:56:33.560
And then they all got some fungus and died.

04:56:33.560 --> 04:56:37.560
So I said what are you going to do and he said well.

04:56:37.560 --> 04:56:40.560
I guess I'll have to do it again.

04:56:40.560 --> 04:56:43.560
I switch from biology to mathematics.

04:56:53.560 --> 04:56:56.560
But in fact he discovered the.

04:56:56.560 --> 04:56:58.560
Growth hormone that.

04:56:58.560 --> 04:57:01.560
He thought came from the nerve and made that.

04:57:01.560 --> 04:57:04.560
If you cut off the limb but of a tadpole.

04:57:04.560 --> 04:57:08.560
It'll grow another one and grow a whole.

04:57:08.560 --> 04:57:11.560
It was a nude I'm sorry it's salamander.

04:57:11.560 --> 04:57:14.560
It'll grow a new hand.

04:57:14.560 --> 04:57:16.560
If you wait till it's got a.

04:57:16.560 --> 04:57:19.560
Substantial hand it won't grow a new one.

04:57:19.560 --> 04:57:21.560
But he discovered the hormone that.

04:57:21.560 --> 04:57:23.560
Makes it do that.

04:57:23.560 --> 04:57:25.560
Yeah.

04:57:25.560 --> 04:57:27.560
Questions from the homework that.

04:57:27.560 --> 04:57:30.560
Relates to the problem solving.

04:57:30.560 --> 04:57:33.560
A common theme is having multiple ways to react to the same problem.

04:57:34.560 --> 04:57:36.560
Which.

04:57:39.560 --> 04:57:42.560
So we have a whole lot of if thens and we have to.

04:57:42.560 --> 04:57:45.560
Choose which if.

04:57:45.560 --> 04:57:51.560
I don't think I have a good theory of that.

04:57:51.560 --> 04:57:54.560
Yes if you have a huge rule based system and they're.

04:57:54.560 --> 04:57:58.560
What does Randy Davis do.

04:57:58.560 --> 04:58:00.560
What if you have a rule based system and.

04:58:01.560 --> 04:58:03.560
A whole lot of rules fit.

04:58:03.560 --> 04:58:06.560
Ifs fit the condition.

04:58:06.560 --> 04:58:09.560
Do you just take the one that's most often worked.

04:58:09.560 --> 04:58:11.560
Or.

04:58:11.560 --> 04:58:15.560
If nothing seems to be working do you.

04:58:15.560 --> 04:58:22.560
You certainly don't want to keep trying the same one.

04:58:22.560 --> 04:58:25.560
I think I mentioned Doug Lenet's rule.

04:58:25.560 --> 04:58:28.560
Some people will assign probabilities to things.

04:58:29.560 --> 04:58:31.560
To behaviors.

04:58:31.560 --> 04:58:33.560
And then pick.

04:58:33.560 --> 04:58:37.560
The way to react in proportional to the probability that.

04:58:37.560 --> 04:58:39.560
That thing has worked in the past.

04:58:39.560 --> 04:58:42.560
And Doug Lenette.

04:58:42.560 --> 04:58:46.560
Thought of doing that but instead he just put the things in a list.

04:58:46.560 --> 04:58:48.560
And whenever a hypothesis.

04:58:48.560 --> 04:58:50.560
Worked better than another one.

04:58:50.560 --> 04:58:52.560
He would raise it.

04:58:52.560 --> 04:58:55.560
Push it toward the front of the list.

04:58:55.560 --> 04:58:59.560
And then whenever there was a choice it would pick.

04:58:59.560 --> 04:59:03.560
If all the rules that fit it would pick the one at the top of the list.

04:59:03.560 --> 04:59:06.560
And if that didn't work it would get demoted.

04:59:06.560 --> 04:59:09.560
So.

04:59:09.560 --> 04:59:12.560
That's when I became an anti probability.

04:59:12.560 --> 04:59:14.560
Person.

04:59:14.560 --> 04:59:15.560
That is.

04:59:15.560 --> 04:59:20.560
If just sorting the things on the list worked pretty well.

04:59:20.560 --> 04:59:24.560
Our probabilities going to do much better.

04:59:24.560 --> 04:59:25.560
No.

04:59:25.560 --> 04:59:28.560
Because if you do probability matching.

04:59:28.560 --> 04:59:32.560
You're worse off then.

04:59:32.560 --> 04:59:36.560
Then what.

04:59:36.560 --> 04:59:39.560
Ray Solomon off discovered that.

04:59:39.560 --> 04:59:41.560
If you have.

04:59:41.560 --> 04:59:46.560
A set of probabilities that something will work.

04:59:46.560 --> 04:59:48.560
And you have no memory.

04:59:48.560 --> 04:59:51.560
So that each time you comments.

04:59:52.560 --> 04:59:54.560
Try the.

04:59:54.560 --> 04:59:57.560
I think I mentioned that the other day but.

04:59:57.560 --> 04:59:59.560
It's worth emphasizing because.

04:59:59.560 --> 05:00:05.560
Nobody in the world seems to know it.

05:00:05.560 --> 05:00:08.560
Suppose you have a list of things.

05:00:08.560 --> 05:00:09.560
He.

05:00:09.560 --> 05:00:11.560
Equals this.

05:00:11.560 --> 05:00:12.560
Or that.

05:00:12.560 --> 05:00:15.560
Or that.

05:00:15.560 --> 05:00:18.560
And.

05:00:18.560 --> 05:00:21.560
In other words suppose is a hundred boxes here.

05:00:21.560 --> 05:00:23.560
And.

05:00:23.560 --> 05:00:25.560
One of them has a.

05:00:25.560 --> 05:00:28.560
Gold brick in it.

05:00:28.560 --> 05:00:31.560
And the others don't.

05:00:31.560 --> 05:00:33.560
And so for each box.

05:00:33.560 --> 05:00:35.560
Suppose the probability is.

05:00:35.560 --> 05:00:38.560
Point nine.

05:00:38.560 --> 05:00:41.560
That this one has the gold brick.

05:00:41.560 --> 05:00:42.560
And.

05:00:42.560 --> 05:00:45.560
This one has point oh one.

05:00:46.560 --> 05:00:50.560
And this has point oh one.

05:00:50.560 --> 05:00:52.560
Let's see how many of them.

05:00:52.560 --> 05:00:54.560
So there's ten of these.

05:00:54.560 --> 05:01:02.560
That makes.

05:01:02.560 --> 05:01:07.560
Now what should you do suppose you're allowed to.

05:01:07.560 --> 05:01:09.560
Keep choosing a box.

05:01:09.560 --> 05:01:10.560
And.

05:01:10.560 --> 05:01:14.560
You want to get your gold brick as soon as possible.

05:01:14.560 --> 05:01:16.560
What's the smart thing to do.

05:01:16.560 --> 05:01:17.560
Should you.

05:01:17.560 --> 05:01:23.560
But you have no memory.

05:01:23.560 --> 05:01:25.560
Maybe the gold brick is decreasing in value.

05:01:25.560 --> 05:01:26.560
I don't care.

05:01:26.560 --> 05:01:27.560
But.

05:01:27.560 --> 05:01:32.560
So should you keep trying point nine.

05:01:32.560 --> 05:01:34.560
If you have no memory.

05:01:34.560 --> 05:01:36.560
Of course not.

05:01:36.560 --> 05:01:41.560
Because if you don't get it the first time you'll never get it.

05:01:41.560 --> 05:01:44.560
If you tried them at random.

05:01:44.560 --> 05:01:45.560
Each time.

05:01:45.560 --> 05:01:48.560
Then you'd have point nine chance of getting it.

05:01:48.560 --> 05:01:49.560
So in.

05:01:49.560 --> 05:01:51.560
In two trials.

05:01:51.560 --> 05:01:53.560
You'd have.

05:01:53.560 --> 05:01:54.560
What am I saying.

05:01:54.560 --> 05:01:55.560
In a hundred trials.

05:01:55.560 --> 05:01:57.560
You're pretty sure to get it.

05:01:57.560 --> 05:01:58.560
But.

05:01:58.560 --> 05:02:03.560
In a hundred trials.

05:02:03.560 --> 05:02:05.560
Almost certain.

05:02:05.560 --> 05:02:07.560
So if you don't have any memory.

05:02:07.560 --> 05:02:11.560
Then probability matching is not a good idea.

05:02:11.560 --> 05:02:14.560
Certainly picking the highest probability.

05:02:14.560 --> 05:02:16.560
Is not a good idea.

05:02:16.560 --> 05:02:17.560
Because.

05:02:17.560 --> 05:02:21.560
If you don't get it the first trial you'll never get it.

05:02:21.560 --> 05:02:25.560
If you keep using the probabilities.

05:02:25.560 --> 05:02:26.560
At.

05:02:26.560 --> 05:02:28.560
What am I saying.

05:02:28.560 --> 05:02:31.560
Anyway what do you think is the best thing to do.

05:02:31.560 --> 05:02:35.560
It's to take the square roots of those probabilities.

05:02:35.560 --> 05:02:38.560
And then divide them by the sum of the square roots.

05:02:38.560 --> 05:02:42.560
So it adds up to one.

05:02:42.560 --> 05:02:44.560
So a lot of psychologists.

05:02:44.560 --> 05:02:47.560
Design experiments until they get the rat.

05:02:47.560 --> 05:02:50.560
To match the probability.

05:02:50.560 --> 05:02:52.560
And then they publish it.

05:02:52.560 --> 05:02:58.560
Sort of like the.

05:02:58.560 --> 05:03:02.560
But if the animal is optimal and doesn't have much memory.

05:03:02.560 --> 05:03:05.560
It shouldn't match the probability of the unknown.

05:03:05.560 --> 05:03:08.560
It should.

05:03:08.560 --> 05:03:14.560
End of story.

05:03:14.560 --> 05:03:17.560
Every now and then I search.

05:03:17.560 --> 05:03:19.560
Every few years.

05:03:19.560 --> 05:03:24.560
To see if anybody has noticed this thing which.

05:03:24.560 --> 05:03:39.560
And I've never found it on the web.

05:03:39.560 --> 05:03:40.560
Yeah.

05:03:40.560 --> 05:03:55.560
So earlier in the course.

05:03:55.560 --> 05:03:58.560
I didn't don't mean to say they don't work.

05:03:58.560 --> 05:04:00.560
Rule based methods are great.

05:04:00.560 --> 05:04:03.560
For some kinds of problems so.

05:04:03.560 --> 05:04:07.560
Most.

05:04:07.560 --> 05:04:10.560
Most systems make money and.

05:04:10.560 --> 05:04:11.560
You know if.

05:04:11.560 --> 05:04:15.560
If you're trying to.

05:04:15.560 --> 05:04:22.560
Make hotel reservations and things.

05:04:22.560 --> 05:04:26.560
This business of rule based systems.

05:04:26.560 --> 05:04:27.560
It has a nice history.

05:04:27.560 --> 05:04:30.560
A couple of AI researchers really.

05:04:30.560 --> 05:04:32.560
Notably Ed Feigenbaum.

05:04:32.560 --> 05:04:34.560
Who was a.

05:04:34.560 --> 05:04:38.560
Student of Newell and Simon.

05:04:38.560 --> 05:04:44.560
Started a company for making rule based systems.

05:04:44.560 --> 05:04:45.560
And.

05:04:45.560 --> 05:04:48.560
Company did pretty well for a while.

05:04:48.560 --> 05:04:50.560
Until.

05:04:50.560 --> 05:04:52.560
And they maintained that.

05:04:52.560 --> 05:04:55.560
Only an expert in artificial intelligence.

05:04:55.560 --> 05:04:58.560
Could be really good at making rule based systems.

05:04:58.560 --> 05:05:00.560
And so they had a lot of customers and.

05:05:00.560 --> 05:05:04.560
Quite a bit of success for a year or two.

05:05:04.560 --> 05:05:07.560
And then some people at Arthur D little.

05:05:07.560 --> 05:05:09.560
Said oh we can do that and.

05:05:09.560 --> 05:05:12.560
They made some systems that worked fine.

05:05:12.560 --> 05:05:15.560
And.

05:05:15.560 --> 05:05:17.560
The market disappeared.

05:05:17.560 --> 05:05:18.560
Because it turned out that.

05:05:18.560 --> 05:05:20.560
You didn't have to be.

05:05:20.560 --> 05:05:22.560
Good at anything in particular.

05:05:22.560 --> 05:05:27.560
To make rule based systems work.

05:05:27.560 --> 05:05:28.560
But.

05:05:28.560 --> 05:05:30.560
For doing.

05:05:30.560 --> 05:05:36.560
Harder problems like translating from one language to another.

05:05:36.560 --> 05:05:39.560
You really needed to have more structure and.

05:05:39.560 --> 05:05:42.560
You couldn't just take the probabilities of.

05:05:42.560 --> 05:05:44.560
Words being in a sentence that you.

05:05:44.560 --> 05:05:48.560
Had to look for diagrams and trigrams and.

05:05:48.560 --> 05:05:55.560
Have some grammar theory and so forth so.

05:05:55.560 --> 05:05:59.560
But generally if you have a.

05:05:59.560 --> 05:06:03.560
Ordinary data processing problem.

05:06:03.560 --> 05:06:07.560
Try rule based system first because.

05:06:07.560 --> 05:06:11.560
If you understand what's going on good chance you'll.

05:06:11.560 --> 05:06:20.560
Get things to work I'm sure that's what the.

05:06:20.560 --> 05:06:22.560
Hawkins.

05:06:22.560 --> 05:06:30.560
Thing started out as.

05:06:30.560 --> 05:06:50.560
I don't have any questions.

05:06:51.560 --> 05:06:56.560
Sure.

05:06:56.560 --> 05:07:00.560
Machines use relatively few electronic components to run a.

05:07:00.560 --> 05:07:02.560
Different type of thought operations.

05:07:02.560 --> 05:07:05.560
All that changes is data over which the operation runs.

05:07:05.560 --> 05:07:08.560
In the critic selector model resources different.

05:07:08.560 --> 05:07:10.560
Of data with different physical parts to bring.

05:07:10.560 --> 05:07:12.560
Which model.

05:07:12.560 --> 05:07:14.560
Critics left.

05:07:14.560 --> 05:07:19.560
Oh actually.

05:07:20.560 --> 05:07:29.560
I've never seen a.

05:07:29.560 --> 05:07:34.560
I've never seen a large scale theory of how the brain.

05:07:34.560 --> 05:07:37.560
Connects it's.

05:07:37.560 --> 05:07:41.560
There doesn't seem to be a global model anywhere.

05:07:41.560 --> 05:07:43.560
Anybody.

05:07:43.560 --> 05:07:45.560
Read any.

05:07:45.560 --> 05:07:50.560
Of science books lately.

05:07:50.560 --> 05:07:54.560
I mean.

05:07:54.560 --> 05:07:57.560
I just don't know of any.

05:07:57.560 --> 05:08:03.560
Any big diagrams.

05:08:03.560 --> 05:08:10.560
Here's this wonderful behavioral diagram so.

05:08:10.560 --> 05:08:16.560
How many of you have run across the word ethology.

05:08:16.560 --> 05:08:18.560
Just a few.

05:08:18.560 --> 05:08:20.560
There's a branch of.

05:08:20.560 --> 05:08:23.560
The psychology of animals.

05:08:23.560 --> 05:08:27.560
Which is.

05:08:27.560 --> 05:08:29.560
Thanks.

05:08:29.560 --> 05:08:32.560
Which is called ethology.

05:08:32.560 --> 05:08:38.560
And it's the study of instinctive behavior.

05:08:38.560 --> 05:08:40.560
So these.

05:08:40.560 --> 05:08:45.560
And the most famous people in that field.

05:08:45.560 --> 05:08:47.560
Who.

05:08:47.560 --> 05:08:51.560
Well Tim Bergen Nico Tim Bergen and Conrad Lorenz.

05:08:51.560 --> 05:08:53.560
Are the most famous.

05:08:53.560 --> 05:08:57.560
I've just lost the name of the.

05:08:57.560 --> 05:09:00.560
Guy around the 1900.

05:09:00.560 --> 05:09:02.560
Who wrote.

05:09:02.560 --> 05:09:05.560
A lot about the behavior of ants.

05:09:05.560 --> 05:09:07.560
Anybody.

05:09:07.560 --> 05:09:09.560
Ring a bell.

05:09:09.560 --> 05:09:12.560
So he was the sort of the first ethologist.

05:09:12.560 --> 05:09:16.560
And these people don't study learning because it's hard to.

05:09:16.560 --> 05:09:18.560
I don't know why.

05:09:18.560 --> 05:09:19.560
But.

05:09:19.560 --> 05:09:22.560
So they're studying instinctive behavior which is.

05:09:22.560 --> 05:09:25.560
What are the things that all fish do.

05:09:25.560 --> 05:09:27.560
Of a certain species.

05:09:27.560 --> 05:09:29.560
And.

05:09:29.560 --> 05:09:33.560
You get these big diagrams.

05:09:33.560 --> 05:09:43.560
And.

05:09:43.560 --> 05:09:46.560
This is from a little book.

05:09:46.560 --> 05:09:48.560
Which you really should read.

05:09:48.560 --> 05:09:51.560
Called the study of instinct.

05:09:52.560 --> 05:10:05.560
And.

05:10:05.560 --> 05:10:07.560
It's a beautiful book.

05:10:07.560 --> 05:10:10.560
And if that's not enough.

05:10:10.560 --> 05:10:13.560
Then there's a two volume.

05:10:13.560 --> 05:10:16.560
Similar book by Conrad Lorenz.

05:10:16.560 --> 05:10:18.560
Who.

05:10:18.560 --> 05:10:19.560
Was.

05:10:19.560 --> 05:10:22.560
Austrian researcher.

05:10:22.560 --> 05:10:24.560
They report.

05:10:24.560 --> 05:10:26.560
They did a lot of stuff together.

05:10:26.560 --> 05:10:27.560
These two.

05:10:27.560 --> 05:10:28.560
People.

05:10:28.560 --> 05:10:30.560
And it's full of.

05:10:30.560 --> 05:10:32.560
Diagrams showing.

05:10:32.560 --> 05:10:34.560
The.

05:10:34.560 --> 05:10:37.560
Main behaviors that they were able to observe.

05:10:37.560 --> 05:10:39.560
Of various.

05:10:39.560 --> 05:10:44.560
Low cost animals.

05:10:44.560 --> 05:10:45.560
I think I.

05:10:45.560 --> 05:10:47.560
Mentioned that I had some fish and I.

05:10:48.560 --> 05:10:50.560
Watched the fish tanks.

05:10:50.560 --> 05:10:52.560
What they were doing for.

05:10:52.560 --> 05:10:55.560
A very long time.

05:10:55.560 --> 05:10:56.560
And.

05:10:56.560 --> 05:10:58.560
Came to no conclusions at all.

05:10:58.560 --> 05:10:59.560
And.

05:10:59.560 --> 05:11:01.560
When I finally read.

05:11:01.560 --> 05:11:03.560
Timbergen and Lorenz.

05:11:03.560 --> 05:11:06.560
I realized that.

05:11:06.560 --> 05:11:08.560
Just it never occurred to me.

05:11:08.560 --> 05:11:09.560
To.

05:11:09.560 --> 05:11:15.560
To guess what to look for.

05:11:15.560 --> 05:11:17.560
My favorite one was.

05:11:17.560 --> 05:11:21.560
That whenever a fire engine went by.

05:11:21.560 --> 05:11:24.560
Lorenz's sticklebacks the male sticklebacks.

05:11:24.560 --> 05:11:27.560
Would go crazy and look for a female.

05:11:27.560 --> 05:11:30.560
Because when the females in heat or whatever it's called.

05:11:30.560 --> 05:11:32.560
Estrus.

05:11:32.560 --> 05:11:37.560
The lower abdomen turns red.

05:11:37.560 --> 05:11:40.560
I think fire engines have turned yellow recently.

05:11:40.560 --> 05:11:41.560
No one.

05:11:41.560 --> 05:11:42.560
I don't know what the.

05:11:42.560 --> 05:11:49.560
Sticklebacks do about that.

05:11:49.560 --> 05:11:53.560
So if you're just an AI.

05:11:53.560 --> 05:11:55.560
You really should look at.

05:11:55.560 --> 05:11:57.560
At least one of these people.

05:11:57.560 --> 05:12:00.560
Because.

05:12:00.560 --> 05:12:02.560
It's the first appearance of rule based.

05:12:02.560 --> 05:12:06.560
Systems in great detail in psychology.

05:12:06.560 --> 05:12:17.560
There weren't any computers yet.

05:12:17.560 --> 05:12:23.560
There must be 20 questions left.

05:12:23.560 --> 05:12:24.560
Yeah.

05:12:25.560 --> 05:12:27.560
So.

05:12:27.560 --> 05:12:28.560
I know that.

05:12:28.560 --> 05:12:30.560
Early on.

05:12:30.560 --> 05:12:33.560
People were kind of.

05:12:33.560 --> 05:12:35.560
They're careful not to apply.

05:12:35.560 --> 05:12:38.560
Ecology of humans.

05:12:38.560 --> 05:12:40.560
Till about 60s.

05:12:40.560 --> 05:12:42.560
With.

05:12:42.560 --> 05:12:44.560
Sociobiology.

05:12:44.560 --> 05:12:46.560
So if you're thinking on that.

05:12:46.560 --> 05:12:48.560
Maybe.

05:12:48.560 --> 05:12:51.560
Around this area.

05:12:51.560 --> 05:12:54.560
I don't know.

05:12:54.560 --> 05:12:57.560
I sort of grew up with Ed Wilson because we.

05:12:57.560 --> 05:13:00.560
Had the same fellowship at Harvard for three years.

05:13:00.560 --> 05:13:02.560
But he was almost never there.

05:13:02.560 --> 05:13:04.560
Because he was.

05:13:04.560 --> 05:13:06.560
Out in the jungle in some little.

05:13:06.560 --> 05:13:08.560
Telephone booth watching the.

05:13:08.560 --> 05:13:10.560
Birds or.

05:13:10.560 --> 05:13:14.560
Bees or.

05:13:14.560 --> 05:13:18.560
You also had a 26 year old aunt.

05:13:18.560 --> 05:13:20.560
Not aunt.

05:13:20.560 --> 05:13:22.560
Aunt.

05:13:26.560 --> 05:13:31.560
A and T.

05:13:31.560 --> 05:13:34.560
I'm not sure what the controversy would have been but.

05:13:34.560 --> 05:13:37.560
Of course.

05:13:37.560 --> 05:13:40.560
There would be humanists who would say.

05:13:40.560 --> 05:13:46.560
People aren't animals but.

05:13:46.560 --> 05:13:51.560
But then what the devil are they.

05:13:51.560 --> 05:13:58.560
Why aren't they better than they.

05:13:58.560 --> 05:14:01.560
You've got to read this it's a fairly short book.

05:14:01.560 --> 05:14:03.560
And you'll never.

05:14:03.560 --> 05:14:05.560
See an animal is the same again.

05:14:05.560 --> 05:14:06.560
Because.

05:14:06.560 --> 05:14:08.560
I swear.

05:14:08.560 --> 05:14:10.560
You start to notice.

05:14:10.560 --> 05:14:13.560
All these little things you're probably wrong.

05:14:13.560 --> 05:14:14.560
But.

05:14:14.560 --> 05:14:18.560
You start picking up little pieces of behavior and trying to.

05:14:18.560 --> 05:14:20.560
Figure out.

05:14:20.560 --> 05:14:29.560
What what part of the instinct system is it and.

05:14:29.560 --> 05:14:35.560
Lawrence was particularly I think in chapter two of the.

05:14:35.560 --> 05:14:38.560
A motion machine I have some quotes from.

05:14:38.560 --> 05:14:43.560
These guys and.

05:14:43.560 --> 05:14:45.560
Lawrence was particularly interested in.

05:14:45.560 --> 05:14:47.560
In how.

05:14:47.560 --> 05:14:49.560
Animals got attached to their.

05:14:49.560 --> 05:14:51.560
Parents that is.

05:14:51.560 --> 05:14:54.560
For those animals that do get attached to.

05:14:54.560 --> 05:14:56.560
Like alligator babies.

05:14:56.560 --> 05:14:59.560
Live in the alligator's mouth.

05:14:59.560 --> 05:15:02.560
For quite a while.

05:15:02.560 --> 05:15:06.560
It's a good safe place.

05:15:06.560 --> 05:15:09.560
And.

05:15:09.560 --> 05:15:12.560
Lawrence would.

05:15:13.560 --> 05:15:15.560
Catch birds.

05:15:15.560 --> 05:15:17.560
Just when they're hatching.

05:15:17.560 --> 05:15:20.560
And within the first day or so.

05:15:20.560 --> 05:15:24.560
Some baby birds get attached to whatever large moving.

05:15:24.560 --> 05:15:27.560
Object is nearby.

05:15:27.560 --> 05:15:30.560
And he that was often Conrad Lawrence.

05:15:30.560 --> 05:15:32.560
Rather than the birds.

05:15:32.560 --> 05:15:34.560
Mother who's.

05:15:34.560 --> 05:15:37.560
Supposed to be sitting on the egg when it hatches and.

05:15:37.560 --> 05:15:39.560
The bird gets attached to the mother most.

05:15:40.560 --> 05:15:42.560
Most birds do because.

05:15:42.560 --> 05:15:45.560
They have to stay around and get fed.

05:15:45.560 --> 05:15:47.560
So.

05:15:47.560 --> 05:15:50.560
It is said that wherever Lawrence went.

05:15:50.560 --> 05:15:53.560
In Vienna.

05:15:53.560 --> 05:15:56.560
There were some ducks or whatever.

05:15:56.560 --> 05:15:58.560
Birds that had gotten imprinted on him.

05:15:58.560 --> 05:16:02.560
Would come out of the sky and land on his shoulder and.

05:16:02.560 --> 05:16:06.560
And on no one else.

05:16:06.560 --> 05:16:08.560
And he has various theories of.

05:16:08.560 --> 05:16:10.560
How they recognize him.

05:16:10.560 --> 05:16:12.560
But.

05:16:12.560 --> 05:16:14.560
But you could do that too.

05:16:22.560 --> 05:16:25.560
Anyway that was quite a field.

05:16:25.560 --> 05:16:27.560
This thing called ethology.

05:16:27.560 --> 05:16:29.560
And.

05:16:29.560 --> 05:16:31.560
Between 1920 and 1950.

05:16:31.560 --> 05:16:33.560
1930 I guess.

05:16:34.560 --> 05:16:36.560
There were lots of people studying.

05:16:36.560 --> 05:16:38.560
The behavior of animals and.

05:16:38.560 --> 05:16:39.560
Ed Wilson is.

05:16:39.560 --> 05:16:42.560
Probably the.

05:16:42.560 --> 05:16:44.560
Most.

05:16:44.560 --> 05:16:46.560
Well known successor to.

05:16:46.560 --> 05:16:48.560
Lorenz and Timbergen.

05:16:50.560 --> 05:16:52.560
And I think he just wrote a book is that.

05:16:52.560 --> 05:16:54.560
Anybody seen it.

05:16:56.560 --> 05:16:59.560
He has a huge book called socio biology.

05:16:59.560 --> 05:17:01.560
Which is too heavy to read.

05:17:04.560 --> 05:17:06.560
I've run out of things.

05:17:09.560 --> 05:17:11.560
Yes.

05:17:11.560 --> 05:17:13.560
Thank you.

05:17:13.560 --> 05:17:15.560
Society of mind.

05:17:15.560 --> 05:17:16.560
Ideas.

05:17:16.560 --> 05:17:18.560
That book.

05:17:18.560 --> 05:17:20.560
Had the machinery from it.

05:17:20.560 --> 05:17:22.560
What would the initial state of the machine be.

05:17:22.560 --> 05:17:23.560
You.

05:17:23.560 --> 05:17:24.560
You.

05:17:24.560 --> 05:17:25.560
You.

05:17:25.560 --> 05:17:26.560
You.

05:17:26.560 --> 05:17:27.560
You.

05:17:27.560 --> 05:17:28.560
You.

05:17:28.560 --> 05:17:29.560
You.

05:17:29.560 --> 05:17:30.560
You.

05:17:30.560 --> 05:17:32.560
You.

05:17:32.560 --> 05:17:33.560
You.

05:17:33.560 --> 05:17:34.560
You.

05:17:34.560 --> 05:17:36.560
You.

05:17:36.560 --> 05:17:37.560
You.

05:17:37.560 --> 05:17:38.560
You.

05:17:38.560 --> 05:17:40.560
You.

05:17:40.560 --> 05:17:42.560
You.

05:17:42.560 --> 05:17:43.560
You.

05:17:43.560 --> 05:17:44.560
You.

05:17:44.560 --> 05:17:45.560
You.

05:17:45.560 --> 05:17:46.560
You.

05:17:46.560 --> 05:17:47.560
You.

05:17:47.560 --> 05:17:48.560
You.

05:17:48.560 --> 05:17:49.560
You.

05:17:49.560 --> 05:17:50.560
You.

05:17:50.560 --> 05:17:51.560
You.

05:17:51.560 --> 05:17:52.560
You.

05:17:52.560 --> 05:17:53.560
You.

05:17:53.560 --> 05:17:54.560
You.

05:17:54.560 --> 05:17:55.560
You.

05:17:55.560 --> 05:17:56.560
You.

05:17:56.560 --> 05:17:57.560
You.

05:17:57.560 --> 05:17:58.560
You you.

05:17:58.560 --> 05:17:59.560
You.

05:17:59.560 --> 05:18:02.320
I guess it depends whether you want it to be a person

05:18:02.320 --> 05:18:07.000
or a marmoset or chicken or something.

05:18:11.760 --> 05:18:14.880
Are there some animals that don't learn anything?

05:18:14.880 --> 05:18:15.720
Must be.

05:18:16.880 --> 05:18:21.640
What are the ones that Sidney Brenner studied?

05:18:21.640 --> 05:18:25.920
See, I'm gonna say like, very simple associations.

05:18:25.920 --> 05:18:27.020
The little worms?

05:18:29.560 --> 05:18:40.560
There was a rumor that if you fed them RNA, was it them or was it some slightly higher animal?

05:18:40.560 --> 05:18:43.960
It was worms.

05:18:43.960 --> 05:18:44.960
What?

05:18:44.960 --> 05:18:45.960
RNA interference.

05:18:45.960 --> 05:18:46.960
Is that what you're talking about?

05:18:46.960 --> 05:18:47.960
Yeah.

05:18:47.960 --> 05:18:54.640
There was one that if you taught a worm to turn left when there was a bright light or

05:18:54.640 --> 05:19:04.640
right and put some of its RNA into another worm, that worm would copy that reaction even

05:19:04.640 --> 05:19:08.360
though it hadn't been trained.

05:19:08.360 --> 05:19:09.360
And this was…

05:19:09.360 --> 05:19:10.360
That's just a worm.

05:19:10.360 --> 05:19:11.360
Is that what it is?

05:19:11.360 --> 05:19:12.360
Slugs.

05:19:12.360 --> 05:19:13.360
Slugs.

05:19:13.360 --> 05:19:14.360
I think it was, yeah.

05:19:14.360 --> 05:19:15.360
Yes.

05:19:15.360 --> 05:19:16.360
It's a lazy-art scarex or something.

05:19:16.360 --> 05:19:20.000
It's a little snail-like thing.

05:19:20.000 --> 05:19:22.520
And nobody was ever able to replicate it.

05:19:22.520 --> 05:19:32.080
So it's that rumor spread around the world quite happily and there was a great science

05:19:32.080 --> 05:19:43.560
fiction story trying to remember in which somebody got to eat some of an alien's RNA

05:19:43.560 --> 05:19:47.680
and got magical powers.

05:19:47.680 --> 05:19:57.800
I think it's Larry Niven who is wonderful at taking little scientific ideas and making

05:19:57.800 --> 05:20:01.440
a novel out of them.

05:20:01.440 --> 05:20:09.280
And his wife Marilyn was a undergraduate here.

05:20:09.280 --> 05:20:21.160
So she introduced me to Larry Niven and I once got to write an article.

05:20:21.160 --> 05:20:23.880
I once gave a lecture and he wrote it up.

05:20:23.880 --> 05:20:31.440
It was one of the big thrills because Niven was one of my heroes.

05:20:31.440 --> 05:20:37.920
Imagine writing a book with a good idea in every paragraph.

05:20:37.920 --> 05:20:49.560
Bernie Vingy and Larry Niven and Frederick Poe seem to be able to do that or at least

05:20:49.560 --> 05:20:50.560
on every page.

05:20:50.560 --> 05:20:51.560
I don't know about every paragraph.

05:20:51.560 --> 05:20:52.560
Yeah.

05:20:52.560 --> 05:21:01.560
To follow up on that question, it seems to me that you almost were saying that if this

05:21:01.560 --> 05:21:08.560
was the difference between these sort of animals and depending on the start of the day, we

05:21:08.560 --> 05:21:12.200
could either create a chicken or a human.

05:21:12.200 --> 05:21:24.120
Well no, I don't think that I don't think that most animals have scripts.

05:21:24.120 --> 05:21:40.600
I might, but I'd say that I don't know where most animals are, but I sort of make these

05:21:40.600 --> 05:21:49.080
six levels and I'd say that none of the animals have this top self-reflective layer except

05:21:49.240 --> 05:21:58.880
for all we know, dolphins and chimpanzees and whatever, it would be nice to know more

05:21:58.880 --> 05:22:07.760
about octopuses because they do so much of wonderful things with their eight legs.

05:22:07.760 --> 05:22:11.520
What kind of, how does it manage?

05:22:11.520 --> 05:22:19.040
Have you seen pictures of an octopus picking up a shell and walking to some quiet place

05:22:19.040 --> 05:22:27.720
that can, there's some movies of this on the web and then it drops the shell and climbs

05:22:27.720 --> 05:22:29.280
under it and disappears.

05:22:29.280 --> 05:22:36.280
It's hard to imagine programming a robot to do that.

05:22:36.280 --> 05:22:37.280
Yeah.

05:22:37.280 --> 05:22:47.280
So I've noticed both your books in the lecture, a lot of your models and diagrams seem to

05:22:47.280 --> 05:22:53.280
have a very hierarchical structure to them, but as you mentioned in your book, other places,

05:22:53.280 --> 05:22:58.280
passing between levels, feedback and self-reference are all very important to diligence.

05:22:58.280 --> 05:23:04.280
So I'm curious if you could discuss some of the uses of these very hierarchical models,

05:23:04.280 --> 05:23:08.280
why you represent so many things in that way and some implementation theory?

05:23:08.280 --> 05:23:18.280
Well, it's probably very hard to debug things that aren't, so we need a sort of meta theory.

05:23:18.280 --> 05:23:27.280
One thing is that, for example, it looks like that all neurons are almost the same.

05:23:27.280 --> 05:23:33.280
Now, there's lots of difference in geometric features of them, but they all use the same

05:23:34.280 --> 05:23:46.280
one or two transmitters and every now and then you run across people saying, oh, neurons

05:23:46.280 --> 05:23:48.280
are incredibly complicated.

05:23:48.280 --> 05:23:51.280
They have 100,000 connections.

05:23:51.280 --> 05:24:00.280
You can find it if you just look up neuron on the web and get these essays, explaining

05:24:00.280 --> 05:24:06.280
that nobody will ever understand them because typically a neuron is connected to 100,000

05:24:06.280 --> 05:24:08.280
others and blah, blah, blah.

05:24:08.280 --> 05:24:13.280
So it must be something inside the neuron that figures out all this stuff.

05:24:13.280 --> 05:24:20.280
As far as I can see, it looks almost the opposite, namely probably the neuron hasn't changed

05:24:20.280 --> 05:24:28.280
for half a billion years very much, except in sort of superficial ways in which it grows

05:24:29.280 --> 05:24:38.280
because if you changed any of the genes controlling its metabolism or the way it propagates impulses,

05:24:38.280 --> 05:24:48.280
then the animal would die before it was born.

05:24:53.280 --> 05:24:57.280
That's why the embryology of all mammals is almost identical.

05:24:57.280 --> 05:25:14.280
You can't make a change at that level after the first generations of cell divisions or

05:25:14.280 --> 05:25:18.280
everything would be clobbered, the architecture would be all screwed up.

05:25:18.280 --> 05:25:25.280
So I suspect that the people who say, well, maybe the important memories of a neuron are inside it

05:25:25.280 --> 05:25:28.280
because there's so many fibers and things.

05:25:28.280 --> 05:25:36.280
I bet it's sort of like saying the important memory in a computer is in the arsenic and phosphorus atoms

05:25:36.280 --> 05:25:39.280
of the semiconductor.

05:25:39.280 --> 05:25:49.280
So I think things have to be hierarchical in evolution because if you're building later stuff on earlier stuff,

05:25:49.280 --> 05:25:54.280
then it's very hard to make any changes in the earlier stuff.

05:25:54.280 --> 05:26:03.280
So as far as I know, the neurons in sea anemones are almost identical to the neurons in mammals

05:26:03.280 --> 05:26:14.280
except for the later stages of growth and the way the fibers ramify.

05:26:15.280 --> 05:26:24.280
Who knows, but there are many people who want to find the secret of the brain in what's inside the neurons

05:26:24.280 --> 05:26:29.280
rather than outside.

05:26:29.280 --> 05:26:36.280
It would be nice to get a textbook on neurology from 50 years in the future,

05:26:36.280 --> 05:26:42.280
see how much of that stuff mattered.

05:26:42.280 --> 05:26:46.280
Where are time machines?

05:26:46.280 --> 05:26:52.280
Most systems have a state that they prefer to be in, like a state that they're most comfortable in.

05:26:52.280 --> 05:27:00.280
Do you think the mind has such a state or would it tend to certain places?

05:27:00.280 --> 05:27:06.280
That's interesting. How does that apply to living things?

05:27:06.280 --> 05:27:12.280
I mean this bottle would rather be here than here, but I'm not sure what you mean.

05:27:12.280 --> 05:27:24.280
Okay, so apparently in Professor Tannenbaum's class he shows this example of a number game.

05:27:24.280 --> 05:27:28.280
He'll give you a sequence of numbers and he'll ask you to find a pattern in it.

05:27:28.280 --> 05:27:33.280
For example, if you had a pattern like 10, 40, 50, and 55,

05:27:33.280 --> 05:27:38.280
he kind of asks the class to come up with different things that could be describing the sequence.

05:27:38.280 --> 05:27:46.280
Between the choice of, oh this sequence is a sequence of the multiples of 5

05:27:46.280 --> 05:27:52.280
versus a sequence of the multiples of 10 or multiples of 11.

05:27:52.280 --> 05:27:59.280
He says something like the multiples of 5 would have a higher private probability.

05:27:59.280 --> 05:28:04.280
So that got me thinking, why would that be?

05:28:04.280 --> 05:28:10.280
Would our minds have a preference for having as few categories as possible

05:28:10.280 --> 05:28:12.280
and trying to view the world around us?

05:28:12.280 --> 05:28:18.280
Trying to categorize things and as few things as possible?

05:28:18.280 --> 05:28:28.280
Sounds very strange to me, but certainly if you're going to generate hypotheses,

05:28:28.280 --> 05:28:41.280
you have to have the way you do it depends on what does this problem remind you of.

05:28:41.280 --> 05:28:50.280
So I don't see how you could make a general...

05:28:50.280 --> 05:28:56.280
If you look at the history of psychology, there are so many efforts to find four laws,

05:28:56.280 --> 05:28:59.280
three laws of motion like Newton's.

05:28:59.280 --> 05:29:06.280
Is he trying to do that?

05:29:06.280 --> 05:29:20.280
And here you're talking about people with language and high level semantics.

05:29:20.280 --> 05:29:32.280
Let's ask him what he meant.

05:29:32.280 --> 05:29:36.280
Yeah, it's more of a social question, but there's always this debate about

05:29:36.280 --> 05:29:41.280
how if AI gets to a point where it can take care of humans, will it ever destroy humanity?

05:29:41.280 --> 05:29:45.280
And do you think that's something that we should fear?

05:29:45.280 --> 05:29:55.280
And if so, is there some way we can prevent it?

05:29:55.280 --> 05:30:15.280
If you judge by what's happened in AI since 1980, it's hard to imagine anything to fear.

05:30:15.280 --> 05:30:22.280
Funny you should mention that I'm just trying to organize a conference sometime next year

05:30:22.280 --> 05:30:25.280
about disasters.

05:30:25.280 --> 05:30:32.280
And there's a nice book about disasters by...

05:30:32.280 --> 05:30:34.280
What's his name?

05:30:34.280 --> 05:30:37.280
The Royal... The Astronomer Royal.

05:30:37.280 --> 05:30:38.280
What?

05:30:38.280 --> 05:30:40.280
Martin Rees.

05:30:40.280 --> 05:30:48.280
So he has a nice book which I just ordered from Amazon and it came the next day.

05:30:48.280 --> 05:31:00.280
And it has about ten disasters like a big meteor coming and hitting the earth.

05:31:00.280 --> 05:31:04.280
I forget the other ten, but I have it in here somewhere.

05:31:04.280 --> 05:31:10.280
So I generated another list of ten to go with it.

05:31:10.280 --> 05:31:18.280
So there are lots of bad things that could happen.

05:31:18.280 --> 05:31:31.280
But I think right now that's not on the top of the list of disasters.

05:31:31.280 --> 05:31:41.280
Eventually some hacker ought to be able to stop the net from working because it's not very secure.

05:31:41.280 --> 05:31:58.280
And while you're at it, you could probably knock out all of the navigation satellites and maybe set off a few nuclear reactors.

05:31:58.280 --> 05:32:04.280
But I don't think AI is the principal thing to worry about.

05:32:04.280 --> 05:32:08.280
But it should very suddenly get to be a problem.

05:32:08.280 --> 05:32:11.280
And there are lots of good science fiction stories.

05:32:11.280 --> 05:32:17.280
My favorite is the Colossus series by DF Jones.

05:32:17.280 --> 05:32:19.280
Anybody know?

05:32:19.280 --> 05:32:22.280
There was a movie called The Forbidden Project.

05:32:22.280 --> 05:32:29.280
And it's about somebody who builds an AI and it's trained to do some learning.

05:32:29.280 --> 05:32:39.280
And it's also the early days of the web and it starts talking to another computer in Russia.

05:32:39.280 --> 05:32:50.280
And suddenly it gets faster and faster and takes over all the computers in the world and gets control of all the missiles.

05:32:50.280 --> 05:32:54.280
Because they're linked to the network.

05:32:54.280 --> 05:33:07.280
And it says, I will destroy all the cities in the world unless you clear off some island and start building the following machine.

05:33:07.280 --> 05:33:10.280
I think it's Sardinia or someplace.

05:33:10.280 --> 05:33:16.280
So they get bulldozers.

05:33:16.280 --> 05:33:21.280
And it starts building another machine which it calls Colossus 2.

05:33:21.280 --> 05:33:25.280
And they ask, what's it going to do?

05:33:25.280 --> 05:33:36.280
And Colossus says, well, you see, I have detected that there's a really bad AI out in space and it's coming this way.

05:33:36.280 --> 05:33:42.280
And I have to make myself smarter than it really quick.

05:33:43.280 --> 05:33:50.280
Anyway, see if you can order the sequel to Colossus.

05:33:50.280 --> 05:33:57.280
That's the second volume where the invader actually arrives and I forget what happens.

05:33:57.280 --> 05:34:08.280
And then there's a third one which was an anticlimax because I guess D.F. Jones couldn't think of anything worse that could happen.

05:34:08.280 --> 05:34:14.280
But Martin Rees can.

05:34:14.280 --> 05:34:15.280
Yeah.

05:34:15.280 --> 05:34:30.280
Going back to her question, an example, if my mind has a state, would that example be more of a pattern recognition example?

05:34:30.280 --> 05:34:35.280
So instead of 10, 40, 50, 55, it wasn't physical.

05:34:35.280 --> 05:34:38.280
Good, fine, great.

05:34:38.280 --> 05:34:46.280
And you have to come up with a word that could potentially fit in that pattern.

05:34:46.280 --> 05:34:49.280
And then that pattern could be ways to answer it.

05:34:49.280 --> 05:34:50.280
How are we?

05:34:50.280 --> 05:34:52.280
Let's do an experiment.

05:34:52.280 --> 05:34:55.280
How many of you have a resting state?

05:35:01.280 --> 05:35:16.280
Sometimes when I have nothing else to do, I try to think of twinkle, twinkle, little star happening with the second one starting in the second measure.

05:35:16.280 --> 05:35:20.280
And then the third one starts up the third measure.

05:35:20.280 --> 05:35:24.280
And when that happens, I start losing the first one.

05:35:24.280 --> 05:35:42.280
And ever since I was a baby, when I have nothing else to do, which is almost never, I try to think of three versions of the same tune at once and usually fail.

05:35:42.280 --> 05:35:46.280
What do you do when you have nothing else to do?

05:35:46.280 --> 05:35:48.280
Any volunteers?

05:35:48.280 --> 05:35:49.280
What's yours?

05:35:49.280 --> 05:35:52.280
I don't have to think anything at all.

05:35:52.280 --> 05:35:54.280
All right, not two or two?

05:35:54.280 --> 05:35:56.280
Not two.

05:35:56.280 --> 05:35:59.280
Isn't that a sort of Buddhist thing?

05:35:59.280 --> 05:36:01.280
Yes, sir.

05:36:01.280 --> 05:36:02.280
Do you ever succeed?

05:36:02.280 --> 05:36:04.280
How do you get out of it?

05:36:04.280 --> 05:36:09.280
You have to think, well, enough of this, nothingness.

05:36:09.280 --> 05:36:11.280
If you succeeded, wouldn't you be dead?

05:36:11.280 --> 05:36:15.280
We're stuck.

05:36:15.280 --> 05:36:20.280
Eventually some stimulus will appear that is too interesting to ignore.

05:36:20.280 --> 05:36:28.280
Right, and threshold goes down until even the most boring thing is fascinated.

05:36:28.280 --> 05:36:33.280
Make a good short story.

05:36:33.280 --> 05:36:38.280
There was actually a movie that really got to me when I was little.

05:36:38.280 --> 05:36:44.280
These aliens were trying to infiltrate people's brains and like their thoughts.

05:36:44.280 --> 05:36:49.280
To keep the aliens from infiltrating your thoughts, you had to think of a wall,

05:36:49.280 --> 05:36:57.280
which didn't make any sense at all, but now whenever I try to think of nothing,

05:36:57.280 --> 05:37:06.280
I just end up thinking of a wall.

05:37:06.280 --> 05:37:17.280
These awful psychoses and about every five years,

05:37:17.280 --> 05:37:24.280
I get an email from someone who says that,

05:37:24.280 --> 05:37:28.280
please help me, there's some people who are putting these terrible ideas in my head.

05:37:28.280 --> 05:37:31.280
Have you ever gotten one, Pat?

05:37:31.280 --> 05:37:39.280
And they're sort of scary because you realize that maybe the person

05:37:39.280 --> 05:37:52.280
will suddenly figure out that it's you who's doing it.

05:37:52.280 --> 05:38:08.280
I remember there was once,

05:38:08.280 --> 05:38:14.280
one of them came to visit, actually showed up and he came to visit Norbert Wiener,

05:38:14.280 --> 05:38:20.280
who is famous for, I mean he's the cybernetics person of the world.

05:38:20.280 --> 05:38:29.280
And this person came in and he got between Wiener and the door

05:38:29.280 --> 05:38:36.280
and started explaining that somebody was putting dirty words in his head

05:38:36.280 --> 05:38:41.280
and making the grass on their lawn die.

05:38:41.280 --> 05:38:49.280
And he was sure it was someone in the government and this was getting pretty scary.

05:38:49.280 --> 05:38:57.280
I was near the door, so I went and got lethin.

05:38:57.280 --> 05:39:03.280
It's a true story because nearby and I got lethin to come in

05:39:03.280 --> 05:39:09.280
and lethin actually took this guy down and took him by the arm and went somewhere

05:39:09.280 --> 05:39:15.280
and I don't know what happened, but Wiener was really scared

05:39:15.280 --> 05:39:20.280
because the guy kept keeping him from going out.

05:39:20.280 --> 05:39:30.280
Lethin was big. Wiener is not very big.

05:39:30.280 --> 05:39:36.280
Anyway, that keeps happening every few years.

05:39:36.280 --> 05:39:41.280
I get one and I don't answer them.

05:39:41.280 --> 05:39:46.280
He's probably sending it to several people and I'm sure one of them

05:39:46.280 --> 05:39:50.280
is much better at it than we are.

05:39:50.280 --> 05:39:55.280
How many of you have ever had to deal with an obsessed person?

05:39:55.280 --> 05:39:58.280
How did they find you?

05:39:58.280 --> 05:40:05.280
I don't know. They found a number of people in the media lab, actually.

05:40:05.280 --> 05:40:08.280
Don't answer anything.

05:40:08.280 --> 05:40:24.280
But if they actually come, then it's not clear what to do.

05:40:24.280 --> 05:40:29.280
Last question.

05:40:29.280 --> 05:40:32.280
Thanks for coming.

05:40:35.280 --> 05:40:39.280
Thank you.
