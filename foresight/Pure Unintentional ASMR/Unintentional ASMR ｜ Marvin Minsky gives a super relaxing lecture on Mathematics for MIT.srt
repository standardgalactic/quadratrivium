1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,740
So, what I'm going to do in this course is discuss mostly ideas that are already in the

2
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:24,600
book called The Emotion Machine, I'm sorry I used that title, and the older book called

3
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:36,360
The Society of Mind, which are, the books are not quite the same, they overlap a bit

4
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:43,680
in material, but they're sort of complementary, I like the old one better because the chapters

5
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:51,760
are all one page long, and they're moderately independent, so if you don't like one you

6
00:00:51,760 --> 00:01:01,200
can skip it. The new book is much denser and has a smaller number of long chapters, and

7
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:12,080
I think it's, over the years I got lots of reactions from young people in high school,

8
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:20,840
for example, almost all of whom like The Society of Mind and found it easy to read and seemed

9
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:30,560
to understand it, there are lots of criticisms by older people who maybe some of them found

10
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:41,040
it harder to put so many fragments together, who knows, but most of this class, most of

11
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:49,920
the things I'd like to say are in those books, so it's really like a big seminar and I'll,

12
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:58,160
my hope is that everyone who comes to this class would have a couple of questions that

13
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:06,040
they'd like to discuss, and if I can't answer them maybe some others if you can, so I'd

14
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:13,120
like to think of this as a super seminar, and normally I don't prepare lectures, and

15
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,880
I just start off asking if there are any questions, and if they're not I get really pissed off

16
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:29,800
because, but anyway I'm going to start with a series of slides. So why do we need machines,

17
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:45,880
and partly there are a lot of problems, unlike most species or kinds of animals, humans have

18
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:55,000
only been around a few million years, and they're very clever compared to other animals,

19
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:04,760
but it's not clear how long they will last, and when we go we might take all the others

20
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:14,760
with us, so there are a whole set of serious problems that are arising because there are

21
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:30,640
so many humans, and here's just a little list of things. There's a better list in a book

22
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:46,760
by the astronomer royal Martin Lise of England, anybody know the title? Yes, our final hour,

23
00:03:46,760 --> 00:04:09,880
it's a slightly scary title, and when I was a teenager, World War II came to an end with

24
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:27,720
the dropping of two atomic bombs on Japan, and I didn't believe the first one was real

25
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:37,040
because it was in Hiroshima, so I assumed that the U.S. had somehow made a big underground

26
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:46,200
underwater tanker with 20,000 tons of TNT and some few grams of radium or something and

27
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:54,040
blown it up in the harbor, and first it flew an airplane over dropping some little thing,

28
00:04:54,040 --> 00:05:04,320
and this was to fool the Japanese into thinking that we have an atomic bomb, but when they

29
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:17,800
did it again over Nagasaki that wasn't feasible, so, and when I was in grade school, sometimes

30
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:25,680
if I said something very bright, I would hear a teacher saying, maybe he's another J. Robert

31
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:36,240
Oppenheimer, because that was the name of a scientist who had been head of the Manhattan

32
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:50,560
Project, and he was, I think, three or four years earlier in grade school than I was, and I thought

33
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,400
it was very strange for a person to have a first name as just being a letter rather than a name,

34
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:11,480
and many years later, when I was at Princeton in graduate school, I met the Robert Oppenheimer,

35
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:20,280
and that was a great pleasure, and in fact he took me to lunch with a couple of other people I

36
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:29,480
admired, namely Gertl and Einstein, which was very exciting, except I couldn't understand

37
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:37,560
Einstein because I wasn't used to people with a strong German accent, but I understood Gertl

38
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:46,000
just fine, and after that lunch was over, I went and spent about a year learning about Turing

39
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:57,840
machines and trying to prove theorems about them and so forth. So anyway, in the course of these

40
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:11,080
talks, we'll run across a few of these people, and here's a big list of the people that I'm mostly

41
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:21,920
indebted to for the ideas in the Society of Mind and the Emotion Machine. The ones in blue are

42
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:37,000
people I've actually met. It would be nice to have met Aristotle because no one really knows much

43
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:47,800
about him, but you really should read, just skim through some of that and you'll find that this is a

44
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:54,440
really smart guy. We don't know if he wrote this stuff or if it were compiled by his students,

45
00:07:54,440 --> 00:08:05,360
like a lot of Feynman's writing is, and von Neumann's writing is edited from notes by their

46
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:17,160
students. Anyway, the astonishing thing about Aristotle is that he seems to be slightly more

47
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:27,280
imaginative than most cognitive scientists you'll run into in the present day. It would have been

48
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:43,040
nice to know Spinoza and Kant and the others. Also, Freud wrote 30 or 40 books, so did he fall off this

49
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:54,760
list? There he is. I just made this list the other day and I was looking up these people to find their

50
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:10,800
birthdays and stuff. Yes? Because they're religious, as far as I can see. Well, who would you, would you

51
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:37,240
say Buddha? Name one. Maybe I never heard of them. Confucius. Well, I only know of them through

52
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:58,440
aphorisms. Single Proverbs, but I don't know that Confucius had a theory of thinking. Well, I've

53
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:10,480
looked at Buddhist theories and they're, I don't think they would get a C plus. And one problem is

54
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:18,800
that there are cultures, there's something about Greek culture because it had science, it had

55
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:33,160
experiments. Somebody has a theory and they say, and like Epimenides Lucretius, somewhere in the society

56
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:43,200
of mind, I think I quoted Lucretius about translucent objects. And he says they have the

57
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:49,600
particular appearance because the rays of light bounce many times before they get to the surface, so

58
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:57,640
you can't tell where they started. And I don't find in Eastern philosophy theories that say, here's what

59
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:08,240
I think and here's a reason why. I've looked at Buddhist stuff and it's strange lists of psychological

60
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:16,520
principles, every one of which is looks pretty wrong. And they make nice two dimensional diagrams,

61
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:22,400
but no evidence for any of them. So I don't know whether to take it seriously.

62
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,560
Well, what can't be tested?

63
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,840
Then why, if they can't be tested, why should one look at it twice?

64
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:06,560
Okay, I think this is a serious argument. It seems to me that science began a little bit in China,

65
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:19,120
a little bit in India. In the Arabic world, they got up to the middle of high school algebra. But then what?

66
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,920
Well, but this wasn't as good as Archimedes, who got to the beginning of calculus. So if you look at most

67
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:36,520
cultures, they never got to the critical point of getting theories, doing experiments, discussing them

68
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:46,160
and then throwing them out. And so if you look at Buddhist philosophy, it's 2,500 years old.

69
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:57,080
If you look at Greek physics, yes, Archimedes almost got calculus and he got lots of nice principles. And

70
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:01,480
Buddha mentions, at some point, if you want to weigh an elephant,

71
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:12,560
put him in a boat and then take the elephant out and put rocks in till the boat sinks at the same level. So there

72
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:20,400
you see a good idea. But if you look at the history of the culture, if people still say this 1000 year old

73
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,120
stuff is good, then you should say, no, it's not.

74
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,280
Sure.

75
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:48,320
No, the question is why did it stop? Why did it stop?

76
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:58,440
Ancient wisdom is generally not very good. And we shouldn't respect it for too long. And that's

77
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:18,160
no, everybody. No, we, we got rid of alchemy, we got rid of what do you call it? What's caloric?

78
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:25,840
You, you use you jump off their shoulder. You don't stay on them.

79
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:35,600
So it's good to know history. But if the history doesn't get anywhere, then you don't want to admire it too

80
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,120
much because you have to ask, why did it stop when it went wrong? And usually went wrong because

81
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:50,360
barbarians came in and, well, you know, it happened to Archimedes. Some, some Roman killed him. But

82
00:14:51,200 --> 00:15:02,160
anyway, no, it's, it's good. It's a good question. Why, why didn't science happen a million years ago?

83
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,920
Because humans are five million years old. So what took it so long?

84
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:18,480
No, it's more. Sure. Okay. Do you have a theory of why science didn't develop for

85
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:27,680
so long? In most cultures, it might be religion, which is a sort of science that doesn't use

86
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:34,360
evidence. And in fact, kills people who try to get it. And so they're, they're systematic reasons why

87
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:41,720
most cultures failed. And maybe somebody has written, is there a book on why science disappeared,

88
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:53,040
except once? It's rather remarkable, isn't it? After all, the idea, if somebody says something,

89
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:59,640
and somebody else says, okay, let's do an experiment to see if that's right. You don't have to very,

90
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:06,120
be very bright. So how come it didn't happen all the time everywhere? Period.

91
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:18,040
He's speculating, even in Europe, there did happen, was it a fluke? And I think he gives the example of,

92
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:25,640
suppose an asteroid or a common crash in Paris in, you know, family year, he gives me 1150 or 1200 or

93
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:31,240
something. Then what? Whether it's with science that they never developed anywhere. He just sort of

94
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:39,800
raised it himself as a thought problem. Well, history is called the flukes. I'm trying to remember who

95
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:51,680
wrote that nice book about the plague. Some woman. And she mentions that this was spread by rats and

96
00:16:51,680 --> 00:17:02,960
fleas or something. And 30 or 40% of the population of many countries in Europe died. And the next

97
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:26,680
generation had a lot of furniture. The standard of living went way up. So anyway, here's a list of

98
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:45,480
disasters and Martin Reese is the Royal Astronomer and has that book about the last hour or whatever. And I'm

99
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:58,200
making another longer list, but he has lots of obvious disasters like some high school student looks up the

100
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:13,040
genetic sequence for smallpox virus has been published. And now you can write a list of nucleotides and send

101
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:19,480
it somewhere. And they'll make it for about 50 cents or a dollar per nucleotide for so for a couple of

102
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:27,400
hundred dollars, you can make a virus or a few hundred. And so one possibility is that some high school

103
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:36,480
student makes some smallpox only gets it wrong and it kills everyone. So there are lots of lots of

104
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:47,920
disasters like that. And no one knows what to do about that because the the DNA synthesis machinery is

105
00:18:47,920 --> 00:19:00,040
becoming less and less expensive and probably the average rich private high school could afford one. So

106
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:10,960
there are lots of other things that could happen. But one particular one is this graph which I just made up.

107
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:29,440
An interesting fact is that since 1950, when the first antibiotics started to appear, as I mentioned, I was a kid

108
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:41,800
in the 1940s, and penicillin had just hit the stands. And there wasn't much of it. And there was a researcher

109
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:55,400
lived a few blocks from us whose dog had cancer. And so its father, I don't know what you call the owner of a

110
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:07,720
dog, sneaked some penicillin out of the lab and gave it to the dog who died anyway. But he said, Well, nobody's

111
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:16,880
tried penicillin on cancer yet. Maybe it will work. And a lot of people were mad at him because he probably

112
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:26,920
cost some human its life. But he said he might have saved a billion humans their lives. So ethics, ethicists are

113
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:34,520
people who give reasons not to do things. And I'm not saying they're wrong. But it's a funny job.

114
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:45,320
So anyway, since that sort of thing happened, and medicine began to advance, people have been living one year

115
00:20:45,320 --> 00:21:02,440
longer every 12. So it's 60 years since 1950. Another. So that's five of those six. So they're living six or seven

116
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:14,200
years longer now than they were when I was born. And somebody mentioned that that curve stopped the last few years.

117
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:27,800
For other reasons. But anyway, if you extrapolated that, you find that the lifespan is going to keep increasing.

118
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:38,840
How much we don't know. Another problem is that you might discover enough about genetics to get rid of most of the

119
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:49,480
serious diseases. Maybe just 20 or 30 genes are responsible for most deaths right now. And if you could fix those,

120
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:56,920
which we can't do yet, there's no way to change a gene in a person. Because invading all the cells is pretty

121
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:06,920
massive intervention. But we'll get around that. And then it might be that people suddenly start living 200 or 300

122
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:18,120
years. No, at some point, the population has to slow down. And so you have, you can only reach equilibrium with one child per

123
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:27,000
family, and probably less than that. And so all the work has to be done by two or 300 year olds. And let's hope they're good

124
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:37,960
and healthy. So anyway, I think it's very important that we get smart robots, because we're going to have to stem the

125
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:48,040
population. And I hope people will live longer and blah, blah, blah. And so these robots have to be smart enough to replace

126
00:22:48,040 --> 00:23:06,000
most people. And how do you make something smart? Well, artificial intelligence is the field whose goal has been to make

127
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:19,840
machines that do things that we regard as smart or intelligent or whatever you want to call it. And the idea of seriously making

128
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:35,680
machines smart has roots that go back to a few pioneers like Leibniz who wrote about automata and that sort of thing. But the idea of

129
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:48,040
the general purpose computer didn't appear till the 1930s and 40s in some sense. The first form of the general purpose computer appears in

130
00:23:48,640 --> 00:24:04,400
really in the 1920s and 30s with the work of a mathematician who, Amel Post at NYU, who I happen to never meet. But we had some friends in

131
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:19,880
common. And he had the idea of production rules and basically rule based systems and proved various theorems about them. Then Kurt Gertl showed

132
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:31,560
that if you had something like a computer or a procedure that had the right kinds of rules, it could compute all sorts of things. But there were

133
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:44,040
some things it couldn't compute, unsolvable problems. And that became an exciting branch of mathematics. And the star thinker in that field was

134
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:56,800
Alan Turing, who invented a very simple kind of universal general purpose computer. Instead of random access memory, it just had a tape which it

135
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:11,520
could write on and read and change symbols and would go back and forth. And if it's in state X at C symbol Y, it will print symbol Z over the

136
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:32,560
X and move to the left or right. And just a bunch of rules like that were enough to make a universal computer. And so from about 1936, it was sort of clear to a large

137
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:49,480
mathematical community that these were great things. And a couple of general purpose like computers, very simple ones, were built in the 1930s and more in the 1940s. And in the 1950s, big

138
00:25:49,480 --> 00:26:08,560
companies started to make big computers, which were rooms full of equipment. But as you know, most programs could only do some particular thing. And none of them were very smart.

139
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:34,560
Whereas a human can handle lots of kinds of situations. And if you have one that that you've never seen before, there's a good chance you'll think of a new way to deal with that, and so forth. And so how do you make a machine that doesn't get stuck almost all the time?

140
00:26:34,560 --> 00:27:01,560
And I like to use the word resourcefulness, although I left an R out of that one. Is there a shorter word? So here's a good example.

141
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:30,560
My favorite example of a situation where a person is born, or less, with a dozen different ways of dealing with something. And the problem that I imagined that you're dealing with is this. My favorite example is I'm thirsty.

142
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:56,560
So I see that glass of water, and I do that and get it. Actually, I am. On the other hand, if I were here, I would never in a whole lifetime do this. You never walk out a window by mistake.

143
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:16,560
We're incredibly reliable. So how do I know how far it is? And that slide shows you 12 different ways that your vision system, that's only your vision system, has to measure distances.

144
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:45,560
So gradients, if things are sort of blurry, then they must be pretty far away. That's sort of a foggy day outside. Here's a situation. If you assume those are both chairs of the same size, and you know that this chair is about twice as far away as that, although you don't well,

145
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:54,560
and you know how far away they are pretty much by the absolute size.

146
00:28:54,560 --> 00:29:12,560
If you have two eyes that work well, then if something is less than 30 feet away, you can make a pretty good estimate of its distance by focusing both eyes on some feature, and your brain can tell how far apart your eyes are looking.

147
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:28,560
So there's 12 different things. It's more than you need. Lots of people are missing half of those. Lots of people have very poor vision in one eye.

148
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:48,560
Some people cannot fuse stereo images, even though both eyes have 20-20 vision, and in some cases, nobody knows why they can't do that.

149
00:29:49,560 --> 00:30:06,560
I think I once took a test for being a pilot, and they wanted to be sure you could do stereo vision, which seemed very strange, because if you're an airplane and you're less than 30 or 40 feet away from something, it's too...

150
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:15,560
Then yes, you can't use stereo, you could use stereo, but it's too late.

151
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:37,560
So anyway, that's interesting. See if you can think of an example where a person has even more 12 of these, but it's pretty amazing, isn't it? That's more redundancy.

152
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:56,560
This is too hard to read, but somehow I found in an Aristotle essay the idea that you should represent things in multiple ways.

153
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:19,560
One person might describe a house as a shelter against destruction by wind, rain, and heat. Another might describe it as a construction of stones, bricks, and timbers, but a third possible description would say it was in that form, in that material, with that purpose.

154
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:47,560
So you see there's two different descriptions. One is the functional description. It's a shelter. The second one is a structural description of how it's made, and Aristotle says which is the better description, and he dismisses the material one or the functional one is not rather the person who combines both in a single statement.

155
00:31:50,560 --> 00:32:08,560
And then I found a paragraph by Feynman who says every theoretical physicist who is any good knows six or seven different ways to represent exactly the same physics, and you know that they're all equivalent,

156
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:20,560
but you keep them all in your head hoping that they will give you different ideas for guessing. I should put more dots.

157
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:44,560
Anyway, that whole argument is to say that the interesting thing about people is that they have so many ways to do things and perceive things and think of things.

158
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:59,560
And in some cases we even know that there are different parts of the brain that are involved in one aspect or another of constructing those different representations or descriptions.

159
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:26,560
If you look at the, one of my favorite books weighs about 20 pounds. It's the book on the nervous system by Candle and Schwartz, and the index to that book is quite a lot of pages long, and it mentions 400 different structures in the brain.

160
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:50,560
So the brain is not like the, well, I shouldn't make fun of the liver, because for all I know, the liver has 400 different mini processes for doing things, but the brain has distinguishable areas that seem to perform several hundred different functions,

161
00:33:50,560 --> 00:34:08,560
and with a microscope, at first they all look pretty much the same, but if you look closely you see different, slightly different patterns of how the most layers of the cortex of the brain, most parts of it have six layers,

162
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:34,560
and each has a population of different kinds of cells. There are a lot of cross connections up and down, and sideways to other, there are engine columns of between 400 and 1,000 cells, and you have a couple of million of those, and there are lots of differences between the columns in different areas, and we know some of the functions.

163
00:34:35,560 --> 00:35:01,560
Most cases we don't know much about how any of them actually work, with the main exception of vision, where the functions of the cells in the visual cortex are fairly well understood at low levels, so we know how that part of the brain finds the edges and boundaries of different areas and textures and regions of the visual field.

164
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:20,560
But we do not know even a little bit about how the brain recognizes something as a chair and an overhead projector and CRT screen, and that sort of thing.

165
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:47,560
So, the kind of question that I got interested in was, how can you have a system which has a very large number of different kinds of computers, each of which by itself might be relatively simple or might not, I suppose,

166
00:35:48,560 --> 00:36:08,560
and how could you put them together into a larger system which could do things like learn language and prove theorems and convince people to do things that they would never have dreamed of doing five minutes earlier and stuff like that.

167
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:37,560
Now, the first sort of things I was interested in was, in fact, how to make, how to simulate simple kinds of nerve cells, because in the 1950s, there was about almost 100 years, really more like 50 years,

168
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:50,560
of science discovering things about neurons and nerve cells, the axons and dendrites that they used to communicate with other neurons.

169
00:36:50,560 --> 00:37:07,560
So, if you go back to 1890, you find a few anatomists discovering some of the functions of, or connections of neurons in the brain, and you find a few experimental physicists.

170
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:32,560
There was no oscilloscope yet, but there were very high-yane galvanometers which could detect pulses going along a nerve fiber, and by 1900, it was pretty clear that part of the activity in a nerve cell was chemical,

171
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:52,560
and part was electrical, and by 1920 or 1930, with the cathode ray tube appearing mostly because of television, but it became possible to do a lot of neurophysiology by sticking needles in brains.

172
00:37:53,560 --> 00:38:08,560
The vacuum tube appears around 1900, and you can make amplifiers that can see millivolts and then microvolts, so in the beginning of the 20th century, there was lots of progress.

173
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:20,560
By 1950, we knew a lot about the nervous system, but we still don't know much about how you learn something in the brain.

174
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:34,560
It's quite clear that the things called synapses are involved, connections between two neurons become better at conducting nerve impulses under some conditions.

175
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:53,560
But no one knows how higher-level knowledge is represented in the brain yet, and the Society of Mind Book had a lot of theories about that, and in particular, there was a theory called K-Lines,

176
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:21,560
K-Lines, knowledge lines or something, that came partly from me and partly from a couple of other researchers named David Walts and Jordan Pollack, and that's a sort of nice theory of how neural networks might remember higher-level concepts.

177
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:32,560
And for some reason, although that kind of work is from around 1980, which is 30 years ago, it has not hit the neuroscience community.

178
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:58,560
So if you look at the Emotion Machine Book or the Society of Mind, in Amazon, you might run across a review by a neurologist named Richard Restak, who says that Minsky makes up a lot of concepts like K-Lines and micro-neems and stuff like that that nobody's ever heard of, and there's no evidence for them,

179
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:15,560
and he ignores the possibility that it isn't the nerve cells in the brain that are important, but the supporting tissues called glia, which hold the neurons up and feed them, and he goes on for a couple of insane paragraphs.

180
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:41,560
It's very interesting because it doesn't occur to him that you can't look for something until you have the idea of it, and so here's this 30-year-old idea of K-Lines, and go and ask your favorite neuroscientist what it is, and he said,

181
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:45,560
oh, I think that's some AI thing, but where's the evidence for it?

182
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,560
What do you suppose is my reaction to that?

183
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,560
Who's supposed to get the evidence?

184
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:07,560
So it seems to me that there's a strange field in neuroscience, which is that it doesn't want new ideas unless you've proved them.

185
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:17,560
So I try to have conversations with them, but get somewhat tired of it.

186
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:29,560
Anyway, but in this course, I'm taking the opposite approach, which is that we don't want a theory of thinking.

187
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:37,560
We want a lot of them because probably psychology is not like physics.

188
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,560
What's the most wonderful thing about physics?

189
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:49,560
The most wonderful thing is that they have unified theories.

190
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:58,560
There wasn't much of a unified theory until Newton, and he got these three laws.

191
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,560
Wonderful laws.

192
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:14,560
One was the gravitational idea that things, bodies attract each other with a force that's the inverse square of the distance between them.

193
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:20,560
Another is that kinetic energy is conserved.

194
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:27,560
Equal reaction is equal and opposite.

195
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:34,560
If two things collide, they transfer equal amount of momentum to both.

196
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:38,560
There was a little problem up to Newton's time.

197
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,560
Galileo got some of those ideas.

198
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:50,560
My impression from reading him is that he has a dim idea that there are two things around.

199
00:42:51,560 --> 00:43:01,560
There's kinetic energy, which is mv, and there's momentum is mv, and there's kinetic energy, which is mv squared.

200
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:09,560
He doesn't have the clear idea that there are two different things here, and you can't blame him.

201
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:22,560
You wouldn't think that two quantities would combine in two different ways to make two important different concepts.

202
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:32,560
Well, that got clear to Newton somehow, and Galileo is a bit muddled, although he gets almost all the consequences of those things right.

203
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:38,560
But he doesn't get the orbits and things to come out.

204
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:51,560
Anyway, what happened in artificial intelligence, like most fields, is that people said,

205
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:57,560
well, let's try to understand thinking and psychology, and let's use physics as our model.

206
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:09,560
And so what we want is to get a very small number of universal laws, and a lot of psychologists struggled around to do that.

207
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:17,560
And then they gradually separated so that there were some psychologists, like Bill Estes,

208
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:25,560
who worked out some very nice mathematical rules for reinforcement-based learning.

209
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:35,560
Got a simple rule, if you designed an experiment right, it predicted pretty well how many trials it would take,

210
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:46,560
a rat or a pigeon or a dog or whatever, to learn a certain thing from trial and error.

211
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:52,560
And Estes got a set of four or five rules, which looked like Newton's laws.

212
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:59,560
And if you designed your experiment very carefully and shielded the animal from noise and everything else,

213
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:15,560
which is what a physicist would do for a physics experiment, the reinforcement theories got some pretty good models of how to make a machine learn.

214
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,560
But they weren't good enough.

215
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:31,560
So here's a whole list of things that happened in the early years of cognitive psychology,

216
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:37,560
when people were trying to make theories of thinking, and they were imitating the physicists.

217
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:55,560
By physics envy to borrow a term of Freud, the idea is, can you find a few simple rules that will apply to very broad classes of psychological phenomena?

218
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:01,560
And this led to various kinds of projects.

219
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:18,560
Lots of neural network and reinforcement and statistical-based methods led to learning machines that were pretty good at learning in some kinds of situations.

220
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:32,560
And they're becoming very popular, but I don't like them because if you have a lot of variables, like 50 or 100,

221
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:41,560
then to use a probabilistic analysis, you have to think of all combinations of those variables.

222
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:54,560
Because if two of them are combined in something like an exclusive or a manner, I just put the light pen in a pocket.

223
00:46:55,560 --> 00:47:01,560
It's either in a left pocket or a right pocket. Can't be both. That's an XOR.

224
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:17,560
That will cause a lot of trouble through a learning machine, and if there are 100 variables, there's no way you could decide which of the two to the 100th Boolean combinations of those variables you should think about.

225
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:36,560
And so lots of statistical learning systems are good for lots of applications, but they just won't cut it to solve hard problems where the hypothesis is a little bit complicated and has seven or eight variables with complicated interactions.

226
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:52,560
So most statistical learning people assume that if you get a lot of partial ones, then you can look for combinations of ones that have high correlations with the result.

227
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:57,560
Then you can start combining them and things get better and better.

228
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:11,560
However, if mathematically, if in effect you're looking for, it depends on the exclusive or of several variables, there's no way to approach that by successive approximations.

229
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:19,560
If any one of the variables is missing, there won't be any correlation of the phenomenon with the others.

230
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:32,560
Anyway, that's a long story, but I think it's worth complaining about because almost all young people who start working on artificial intelligence look around and say, what's popular?

231
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:42,560
Statistical learning. So I'll do that. That's exactly the way to kill yourself scientifically.

232
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:55,560
You don't want to get the most popular thing. You want to see what am I really good at that's different and what are the chances that that would provide another thing.

233
00:48:55,560 --> 00:49:00,560
So you end of long speech.

234
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:25,560
Another problem in the last 30 years, and I'm sort of, as you'll see during my lectures, I think a lot of wonderful things happened between 1950 when the idea of AI first got articulated in the 1950s.

235
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:41,560
And then the 20 years after that from 1960 to 1980, a lot of early experiments, and I'll show you some of them, looked very promising.

236
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:49,560
In fact, they may be, here we go.

237
00:49:49,560 --> 00:50:15,560
1961. Jim Slagle was a young graduate student here at MIT.

238
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:37,560
He was blind. He had gotten some retinal degeneration thing in his first or second year of high school. He was told that he would lose all his vision and there was no treatment or hope.

239
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:47,560
So he learned Braille while he could still see. And when he got to MIT, he was completely blind.

240
00:50:47,560 --> 00:51:03,560
But there was a nice big parking lot in Technology Square, and he would ride a bicycle and people like Sussman and Winston and whoever was around would yell at him,

241
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:16,560
telling him where the next obstacle would be, and Jim got better and better at that, and nothing would stop him.

242
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:24,560
And he decided he would write a program that, oh, I wrote a program that would take any formula and find its derivative.

243
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:28,560
It was really easy because there are just about five rules.

244
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:39,560
Like if there's a product UV, then you compute U times the derivative of V plus V times, you know, U, T, V plus V, D, U.

245
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:46,560
So I wrote a 20-line list program that did all the algebraic expressions.

246
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:55,560
And what it would do is put D's in and then in the right place, and then it would go back through the expression again.

247
00:51:55,560 --> 00:52:02,560
Wherever it saw a D, it would do the derivative of the thing after that, and nothing to it.

248
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:12,560
So Slagle said, well, I'll do integrals. And we all said, well, that's very hard. Nobody knows how to do it.

249
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:27,560
And in fact, in Providence at the home of the American Mathematical Society, there is a big library called the Bateman Manuscript Project,

250
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:32,560
which has been collecting all known integrals for 100 years.

251
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:39,560
And when anybody finds a new integral that they can integrate in closed form,

252
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:50,560
they send the formulas to the Bateman Manuscript Project, and some hackers there have developed ways to index it.

253
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:58,560
So if you had an integral and you didn't know how to integrate it, you could look it up.

254
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:01,560
And that was pretty big.

255
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:20,560
I should say that Slagle succeeded in writing a program that managed to do all of the kinds of integrals that one usually found on the first year calculus course at MIT,

256
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:27,560
and got an A in those, couldn't do word problems.

257
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:38,560
And the uncanny thing is that if it was a problem that usually took an MIT student five or 10 minutes, Slagle's program would take five or 10 minutes.

258
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:45,560
It's running on a IBM 701 with 20 millisecond cycle time.

259
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:48,560
It's incredibly slow.

260
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:54,560
You can type almost that fast.

261
00:53:54,560 --> 00:54:00,560
And 16K of words of memory.

262
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:05,560
So there's no significance whatever to this accident of time.

263
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:18,560
It would now take a microsecond or so, be a thousand million times faster than a student.

264
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:20,560
Quite remarkable.

265
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,560
I don't have a slide.

266
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:26,560
Joel Moses then, Slagle went and graduated.

267
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:34,560
Joel Moses was another student who was, is he a provost now or what?

268
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,560
What?

269
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:39,560
He got tired of it.

270
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:48,560
A terrific student, and he set up a project called Maxima for Project Max Symbolic, something or algebra.

271
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:56,560
And got people, several people all over the country, working on integration.

272
00:54:56,560 --> 00:55:07,560
And at some point, a couple of them, Bobby Kavanis and forget the other one, found a procedure that could in fact integrate everything,

273
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:12,560
every algebraic expression that has a, can be integrated in closed form.

274
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:15,560
I forget the couple of constraints on it.

275
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:20,560
And that became a widely used system.

276
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:26,560
It ultimately got replaced by Stephen Wolfram's Mathematica.

277
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:33,560
But Maxima was sort of the world class symbolic mathematician for quite a few years.

278
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:45,560
And Moses mentioned to me, he had read Slagle's program thesis.

279
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:54,560
And it took him a couple of weeks to understand the two pages of, or three pages of Lisp that Slagle had written.

280
00:55:54,560 --> 00:56:11,560
Because being blind, Slagle had tried to get the thing into as compact a form as possible.

281
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:14,560
But that's symbolic.

282
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:17,560
It's too easy.

283
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:21,560
It wasn't a more ambitious one, which was three years later.

284
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:28,560
Dan Bobrow, who is now a vice president doing something at Xerox.

285
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:31,560
And it solved problems like this.

286
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:35,560
The gas consumption of my car is 15 miles per gallon.

287
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:40,560
The distance between Boston and New York is 250 miles.

288
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:46,560
What is the number of gallons used on a trip between Boston and New York?

289
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:51,560
And it chomps away and solves that.

290
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:54,560
It has about 100 rules.

291
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:58,560
It doesn't really know what any of those words mean.

292
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:05,560
But it thinks that the word is is equals.

293
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:09,560
The distance between doesn't care what Boston and New York is.

294
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:15,560
It has a format thing, which says the distance between two things.

295
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:24,560
And it never bothers to, you see, because the phrase Boston and New York occurs twice in the example.

296
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:28,560
It just replaces that by some symbol.

297
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,560
It was fairly remarkable.

298
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:37,560
And generally, if you had an algebra problem and you told it to Bobrow,

299
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:40,560
Bobrow could type something in and it would solve it.

300
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:44,560
If you typed it in, it probably wouldn't.

301
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:49,560
But it was, you know, it had more than half a chance or less, about half a chance.

302
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,560
So it was pretty good.

303
00:57:51,560 --> 00:58:01,560
And if you look at an out-of-print book, I compiled called Semantic Information Processing.

304
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:04,560
Most of Bobrow's program is in that.

305
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:08,560
So that's 1964.

306
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:13,560
I'll skip Winograd, which is perhaps the most interesting program.

307
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:22,560
This was a program where you could talk to a robot that...

308
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:25,560
I don't have a good picture on the slide.

309
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:28,560
But there are a bunch of blocks of different colors.

310
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:32,560
They're all cubes in the rectangular blocks.

311
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:40,560
And you can say, which is the largest block on top of the big blue block?

312
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,560
And it would answer you.

313
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:50,560
And you could say, put the large red block on top of the small green block.

314
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,560
And it would do that.

315
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:59,560
And Winograd's program was, of course, a symbolic one.

316
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:07,560
We actually built a robot, and I guess we built it second.

317
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:15,560
Our friends at Stanford built a robot, and they imported Winograd's program.

318
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:24,560
And they had the robot actually performing these operations that you told it to do by typing.

319
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:28,560
And it was pretty exciting.

320
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:38,560
My favorite program in that period was this one, because it's so psychological.

321
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:44,560
This is called a geometrical analogy test, and it's on some IQ tests.

322
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:50,560
A is to be as C is to which of the following five.

323
00:59:51,560 --> 01:00:01,560
And Evans wrote a set of rules, which were pretty good at this.

324
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:07,560
It did as well as 16-year-olds, and it picks this one.

325
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:18,560
And if you ask it why, it says something like...

326
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:21,560
I don't have a reason that...

327
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:25,560
It moves the largest object down or something like that.

328
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:29,560
It makes up different reasons, but...

329
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:34,560
So, you see, in some sense, we're going backwards in age,

330
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:43,560
because we're going from calculus to algebra to simple analogies.

331
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:47,560
Oh, there it is.

332
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:51,560
That's one where the largest object moves down.

333
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:59,560
I don't know why I have two of them.

334
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:02,560
These are for another lecture.

335
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:13,560
Okay.

336
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:19,560
So that was a period in which we picked problems that people considered hard,

337
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:22,560
because they were mathematical.

338
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:30,560
But when you think about it more, you see, well, those math things are just procedures,

339
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:39,560
and once you know what Laplace and Gauss and those mathematicians Newton and people did,

340
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:44,560
you can write down systematic procedures for integrating

341
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:52,560
or for solving simultaneous algebraic constraint equations or things like that.

342
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:54,560
And so there's very little to it.

343
01:01:54,560 --> 01:02:02,560
So in some sense, if you look at what you're doing in math in high school, in education,

344
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:05,560
you're going from hard to easy.

345
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:07,560
It's just that people aren't...

346
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:13,560
Most people aren't very good at obeying really simple rules,

347
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:19,560
because it's so hideously boring or something.

348
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:26,560
So we gradually started to ask, well, why can't we make machines understand everyday things

349
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:32,560
and the things that everyone regards as common sense,

350
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:37,560
and people can do so you don't need machines to do them?

351
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:46,560
One of my favorite examples is, why can you pull something with a string but not push?

352
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:55,560
And there's been a lot of publicity recently about that interesting program

353
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:59,560
that I've written a group at IBM called Watson,

354
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:15,560
which is good at finding facts about sports people and celebrities and politics and so forth.

355
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:22,560
But there's no way it could understand why you could pull something with a string but not push.

356
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:29,560
And I don't know of any program that has that concept or way of dealing with it.

357
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:33,560
So that's what I got interested in.

358
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:42,560
And starting around maybe the middle 1970s or late 1970s,

359
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:49,560
several of us started to stop doing the easy stuff

360
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:59,560
and try to make theories of how you would do the kinds of things that people are uniquely good at.

361
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:03,560
I don't know of animals.

362
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:05,560
Well, I don't know.

363
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:09,560
I'm sure a monkey wouldn't try to push anything with a string.

364
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:19,560
Maybe it does it very quickly and you don't notice.

365
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:33,560
And one aspect of common sense thinking is going right back to that idea of vision having a dozen different systems.

366
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:37,560
What I think is that whatever a person normally is doing,

367
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:42,560
they are probably representing it in several different ways.

368
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:52,560
And here's an actual scene of two kids named Julie and Henry who are playing with blocks.

369
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:56,560
It's pretty hard to see those blocks.

370
01:04:56,560 --> 01:05:05,560
And you can think that Julie is thinking seven thoughts.

371
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:12,560
I'd like to see a longer list, maybe a good essay would be to take a few examples and say,

372
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:16,560
what are the most common micro worlds?

373
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:26,560
See physical, social, emotional, mental, instrumental, whatever that is, visual, tactile, spatial.

374
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:30,560
She's thinking all these things. What if I pulled out that bottom block?

375
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:33,560
You can't see the tower very well.

376
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:37,560
Should I help him or knock his tower down?

377
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:39,560
How would he react?

378
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:42,560
I forgot where I left the arch shaped block.

379
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:45,560
That was real.

380
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:48,560
It's somewhere over here.

381
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:52,560
But I don't think maybe it's that.

382
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:55,560
I don't know.

383
01:05:55,560 --> 01:06:03,560
I remember when it happened, she mentioned that she reached around and it wasn't where she thought it was.

384
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:09,560
So common sense thinking involves this.

385
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:12,560
In most cases, I think several representations.

386
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:28,560
I don't know if it's as many as seven or maybe 20 or what, but that's the kind of thing we want to know how to do.

387
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:31,560
Okay, I think I'll stop and we'll discuss things.

388
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:43,560
But in the next lecture, I'll talk about a model of how I think thinking works.

389
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:49,560
What's the difference between us and our ancestors?

390
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:52,560
We know we have a larger brain.

391
01:06:52,560 --> 01:07:02,560
But if you think about it, if you took the brain that you already had in say,

392
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:09,560
I remember the name of the little monkey that looks like a squirrel, jumps around in trees.

393
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:12,560
Anybody know it?

394
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:13,560
What?

395
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:15,560
Maybe.

396
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:19,560
It's a squirrel like thing.

397
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:23,560
I didn't know it was a monkey till you took a close look.

398
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:24,560
Maybe.

399
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:25,560
Lemur?

400
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:30,560
I don't, I forget.

401
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:40,560
Anyway, if you just made the brain bigger, then the poor animal would be slower and heavier and would need more food and take longer to reproduce.

402
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:44,560
The joke about difficulty to give birth.

403
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:48,560
I don't know if any animal has the problem that humans have.

404
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:53,560
A lot of people die.

405
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:56,560
And so on.

406
01:07:56,560 --> 01:08:03,560
So how did we evolve new ways to think and so forth?

407
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:29,560
And my first book, The Society of Mind, had this theory that maybe we evolved in a series of higher and higher levels or management structures built on the earlier ones.

408
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:41,560
And this particular picture suggests that I got this idea from Sigmund Freud's early theories.

409
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:45,560
There's been a lot of Freud bashing recently.

410
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:47,560
You can look on the web.

411
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:52,560
I forget the authors, but there are a couple of books saying that he made up all his data.

412
01:08:52,560 --> 01:09:09,560
And there's no evidence that he ever cured anyone and that he lied about all the data mentioned in his 30 or 40 books and so forth.

413
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:12,560
Yes, right.

414
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:30,560
But the funny part is that if you look at his first major book, 1895, called The Interpretation of Dreams, it sort of outlines this theory that most of thinking is unconscious and it's processes you can't get access to.

415
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:37,560
And it has a little bit about sex, but that's not a major feature.

416
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:49,560
And it's just full of great ideas that the cognitive psychologists finally began to get in the 1960s again and never give credit to Freud.

417
01:09:49,560 --> 01:10:04,560
So he may well have made up his data, but if you have a very good theory and nobody will listen to you, what can you do?

418
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:09,560
His friend Rudolf Fleece listened to him.

419
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:32,560
And there was another paper on how the neurons might be involved in thinking, which was also written around 1895, but never got published till 1950 by, forget who, called Project for a Scientific Psychology.

420
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:38,560
And it's full of ideas that if they had been published, might have changed everything.

421
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:50,560
Because anyway, what's on your mind?

422
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:52,560
What would you like to hear about?

423
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:58,560
Who has another theory?

424
01:10:58,560 --> 01:10:59,560
Great.

425
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:08,560
So earlier you talked a little bit about how we don't really see the neuroscience, all the things like K-Lines, etc.

426
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:17,560
Do you think it's because they're just really hard to find or no one's actually looking for them?

427
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:31,560
S. Dex Review says he uses vague ill-defined terms like K-Line and Microneme and a couple of others, and Frame and so forth.

428
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:38,560
They're very well-defined.

429
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:45,560
When he talks about neurotransmitters, it's as though he thinks that chemical has some real significance.

430
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:54,560
Any chemical would have the same function as any other one, provided there's another receptor that causes something to happen in the cell membrane.

431
01:11:54,560 --> 01:12:03,560
So you don't want to regard acetylcholine or epinephrine as having mental significance.

432
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:08,560
It's just another pulse, but very low resolution.

433
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:24,560
And yes, a neurochemical might affect all the neurons a little bit and raise the average amount of activity of some big population of cells and reduce the average activity of some others.

434
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:26,560
But that's nothing like thinking.

435
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:35,560
That's like saying, in order to understand how a car works, what's the most insulting thing I could say?

436
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:50,560
Or to understand how a computer works, you have to understand the arsenic and phosphorus and or what's the other one?

437
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:54,560
You have to understand these atoms that are, what?

438
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:57,560
Well, that's the matrix.

439
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:05,560
So there are these one part in a million impurities, and that's what's important about a computer, isn't it?

440
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:09,560
The fact that the transistor has gain and so forth.

441
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:11,560
Well, no.

442
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:14,560
The trouble with the computer is the transistors.

443
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:34,560
That's why practically every transistor in the computer is mated to another one in opposite phase to form a flip-flop whose properties are exactly the same except one in a quadrillion times.

444
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:40,560
In other words, everything chemical about a computer is irrelevant.

445
01:13:40,560 --> 01:14:02,560
And I suspect that almost everything chemical about the brain is unimportant except that it causes, it helps to make the columns in the cortex which are complicated arrangements of several hundred cells work reliably.

446
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:09,560
Whereas the neuroscientist is looking for the secret in the sodium.

447
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:16,560
When a neuron fires, the important thing is that that lets the sodium in and the potassium out or vice versa.

448
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:18,560
I forget which.

449
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:20,560
At 500 millivolts.

450
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:23,560
Really quite a colossal event.

451
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:25,560
But it has no significant.

452
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:41,560
It's only when it's attached to a flip-flop or to something like a K line which has an encoder and decoder of a digital sort every few microns of its length that you get something functional.

453
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:50,560
So the trouble is the poor neuroscientist started out with too much knowledge about the wrong thing.

454
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:59,560
The chemistry of the neuron firing is very interesting and complicated and cute.

455
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:05,560
And in the case of the electric eel, you know what happened there.

456
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:19,560
The neuron synapse, it got rid of the next neuron and it just, in the electric eel, you have a bunch of synapses or motor end plates, they're called, in series.

457
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:24,560
So instead of half a volt, if you have 300 of those, you get 150 volts.

458
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:30,560
I think the electric shock that an electric eel can give you is about 300 volts.

459
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:40,560
And this can cause you to drown promptly if you are in the wrong way when it happens to bump into you.

460
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:44,560
I don't know why I'm rambling this way.

461
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:50,560
You're welcome to study neuroscience, but please try to help them instead of learn from them.

462
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:57,560
And they just don't know what a K line is.

463
01:15:57,560 --> 01:16:04,560
And that's a paper that's been widely read, published in 1980, and RESTAC says, ill-defined.

464
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:08,560
And I guess he couldn't understand it.

465
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:11,560
Yeah, yeah.

466
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:18,560
Why instead of trying to make the neuroscientists, like trying to find this in the human mind,

467
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:28,560
why don't we just, like, as computer scientists, program, like, the K lines and try to prove that all this is the human mind and the claim of the producer?

468
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:36,560
Like, why is that not widely spread into the computer scientist field?

469
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:41,560
Well, I'm surprised how little has been done.

470
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:45,560
Mike Travers has a thesis, Tony Hearn.

471
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:49,560
There are three master's theses on K lines.

472
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:53,560
They sort of got them to work to solve some simple problems.

473
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:58,560
But I'd go further.

474
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:07,560
I've never met a neuroscientist who knows the pioneering work of Newell and Simon in the late 1950s.

475
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:11,560
So there's something wrong with that community.

476
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:14,560
They're just ignorant.

477
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:17,560
They're proud of it.

478
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:20,560
Oh, well.

479
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:26,560
I spent some time learning neuroscience when I was...

480
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:30,560
I once had a great stroke of luck when I was a...

481
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:36,560
I guess I was a junior at Harvard and there was a great new biology building that was just constructed.

482
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:40,560
You probably know it's a great big thing with two rhinoceroses.

483
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:45,560
What are those two huge animals?

484
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:55,560
So this building was just finished and half occupied because it was made with the future.

485
01:17:55,560 --> 01:18:01,560
So I wandered over there and I met a professor named John Welsh.

486
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:05,560
And I said, I'd like to learn neurology.

487
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:10,560
And he said, great, well, I have an extra lab.

488
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:15,560
Why don't you study the crayfish claw?

489
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:17,560
And I said, great.

490
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:22,560
So he gave me this lab, which had four rooms and a dark room.

491
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:29,560
And a lot of equipment and nobody there.

492
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:32,560
And he had worked on crayfish.

493
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:41,560
So there was somebody who went every week up to Walden Ponder somewhere and caught crayfish and bringing them back.

494
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:44,560
And I was a radio amateur hacker at the time.

495
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:46,560
So I was good at electronics.

496
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:51,560
So I got my crayfish and Welsh showed me how to.

497
01:18:51,560 --> 01:19:00,560
The great thing about this preparation is you can take the crayfish and if you claw and if you hold it just right, go snap.

498
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:03,560
It comes off, grows another one.

499
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:07,560
It takes a couple of years.

500
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:11,560
And then there's this white thing hanging out, which is the nerve.

501
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:17,560
And it turns out it's six nerves, one big one and a few little ones.

502
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:24,560
And if you keep it in ringer solution, whatever that is, it can live for several days.

503
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:36,560
So I got a lot of switches and little inductors and things and made a gadget and mounted this thing with six wires going to these nerves.

504
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:49,560
And then I programmed it to reach down and pick up a pencil like that and wave it around.

505
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:52,560
Well, that's obviously completely trivial.

506
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:57,560
And all the neuroscientists came around and gasped and said, that's incredible.

507
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:05,560
How did you do that?

508
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:11,560
They had never thought of putting the thing back together and making it work.

509
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:31,560
Anyway, it was, I always reminding myself that I'm the luckiest person in the world because every time I wanted to do something, I just happened to find the right person.

510
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:38,560
And they'd give me a lab.

511
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:49,560
I got an idea for a microscope and there was this great professor, Purcell, who got the Nobel Prize after a while.

512
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:52,560
And he said, that sounds like it would work.

513
01:20:52,560 --> 01:21:00,560
Why don't you take this lab?

514
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:07,560
It was in the Jefferson.

515
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:12,560
Anyway, yeah.

516
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:19,560
Part of the reason that you don't see experimental neuroscience on things like K-lines is that neurons are long and thin.

517
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:28,560
So if you want to do an experiment to actually measure a real neural network, you have to trace structures with roughly maybe tens of nanometer resolution.

518
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:34,560
But you need to trace them over what might be a couple or even tens of millimeters to charge a week.

519
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:41,560
And you need to do this for thousands and thousands of neurons before you could get to the point of seeing something like a K-line and understanding it.

520
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:45,560
So it's just a massive data acquisition and processing problem.

521
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:46,560
But they're doing that.

522
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:47,560
They're trying to try to.

523
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:51,560
But they don't know what to look for.

524
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:54,560
Maybe you don't have to do so much.

525
01:21:54,560 --> 01:22:01,560
Maybe you just have to do a few sections here and there and say, well, look, there were 400 of these here.

526
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:03,560
Now there's only 200.

527
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:06,560
It looks like this is the same kind.

528
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:08,560
Maybe you don't have to do the whole brain.

529
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:23,560
Even getting a single neuron is because you might get down to, you need to be looking at electron micrographs of grains that are sliced at about 30 nanometer slices.

530
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:29,560
So even just having a single person reconstruct a single neuron might take weeks.

531
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:30,560
Well, I don't know.

532
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:36,560
Maybe a bundle of K-lines is a half a millimeter thick.

533
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:40,560
Oh, so you actually do some larger scale structure to start looking at.

534
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:41,560
Yeah.

535
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:44,560
Why not?

536
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:49,560
I don't think they have no idea what to look for.

537
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:55,560
I could give you 20 of those in five minutes, but nobody's listening.

538
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:02,560
What scale?

539
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:03,560
I don't know.

540
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:05,560
I mean, they know what the neurons look like.

541
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:09,560
So you know what to look for if you're saying there's a neuron that level.

542
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:13,560
I'm saying you may only have to look at the white matter.

543
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:15,560
Oh, yeah.

544
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:26,560
Ignore the neurons because the point of K-lines is where do these go and what goes into them and out.

545
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:27,560
I don't know.

546
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:34,560
It's just this idea, let's map the whole brain, 100 billion things.

547
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:36,560
And then people, I rest exit.

548
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:40,560
Oh, and there's a thousand supporting cells for each neuron.

549
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:47,560
He's just glaring in the obscurity of it rather than trying to contribute something.

550
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:50,560
Anyway, if you run into him, give him my regards.

551
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:59,560
I really wonder how somebody can write something like that.

552
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:04,560
Yes.

553
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:07,560
Excuse my ignorance, but what is a K-line?

554
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:19,560
The idea is that suppose one part of the brain is doing something and it's in some particular state

555
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:29,560
that's very important, like I don't know, like I've just seen a glass of water.

556
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:41,560
Then another part of the brain would like to know there's a glass of water in the environment.

557
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:48,560
And I've been looking for one, so I should try to take over and do something about that.

558
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:54,560
Now at the moment, there's no theory of what happens in different parts of the brain

559
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:57,560
for a simple thing like that to happen.

560
01:24:57,560 --> 01:25:11,560
No theory at all, except they use the word association or they talk about what are the purposeful neurons.

561
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:13,560
Goal, forget.

562
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:23,560
Okay, so my theory is that there are a bunch of things which are massive collections of nerve fibers,

563
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:26,560
maybe a few hundred or a few thousand.

564
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:35,560
And when the visual system sees an apple, it turns on 50 of those wires.

565
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:41,560
And when it sees a pear, it turns on a different hundred or 50 of those wires,

566
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:44,560
but about 20 of them are the same, so forth.

567
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:47,560
In other words, it's like the edge of a punched card.

568
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:52,560
Have you ever seen a card-based retrieval system?

569
01:25:52,560 --> 01:26:04,560
If you have a book that has, suppose it's about physics and biology and Sumatra.

570
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:11,560
And a typical five-by-eight card has 80 holes in the top edge.

571
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:20,560
So what you do is, if it's Sumatra, you punch eight of these holes at random, a particular set.

572
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:26,560
They're assigned to the Sumatra, and then if it's, I forget what my first two examples were,

573
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:30,560
but you punch eight or ten holes for each of the other two words.

574
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:32,560
So now there are 24 punches.

575
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:38,560
Only probably four or five of them are duplicates, so you're punching about 20 holes.

576
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:45,560
And now, if something is looking for the cards that were punched for those three things,

577
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:49,560
even if there are 30 or 40 other holes punched in the card,

578
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:54,560
you stick your 20 wires through the whole deck and lift it up,

579
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:59,560
and only cards fall out that had those three categories punched for.

580
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:02,560
So you see, even though you had 80 holes,

581
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:09,560
you could punch combinations of up to a million different categories into that,

582
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:15,560
and if you have to put a bunch of wires through,

583
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:20,560
you'll get all of the ones that were punched for those categories, the categories you're looking for,

584
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:24,560
and you might get three or four other cards that will come down also

585
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:30,560
because all of the eight holes were punched for some category by accident.

586
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:34,560
Do you get the picture? I'll send you a reference.

587
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:46,560
It was invented in the early 1940s by a Cambridge scientist here named Calvin Moores,

588
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:53,560
and was widely used in libraries for information retrieval until computers came along.

589
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:58,560
But anyway, that's the sort of thing you could look for in a brain

590
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:03,560
if you had the concept in your head of Zato coding,

591
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:08,560
but I've never met a neuroscientist who ever heard of such a thing.

592
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:15,560
So you have this whole community which doesn't have a set of very clear ideas

593
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:22,560
about different ways that knowledge or symbols could be represented in neural activity.

594
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:26,560
So good luck to them when they get their big map.

595
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:39,560
They'll still have to say, what do I do with a hundred billion of these intricate accounts?

596
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:40,560
Yeah?

597
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:45,560
What are your thoughts about the current artificial intelligence research at MIT,

598
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:48,560
such as Winston's Legendes project?

599
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:53,560
Winston is just about one of the best ones in the whole world.

600
01:28:53,560 --> 01:29:04,560
I don't know any other projects that are trying to do things on that higher level of common sense knowledge.

601
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:12,560
He's just lost a lot of funding, so one problem is how do you support a project like that?

602
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:25,560
Have you followed it? I don't know if there's a recent summary of what they're doing.

603
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:32,560
We used to write a new book every year called The Progress Report.

604
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:42,560
The nice thing is that we had a very good form of support from ARPA, or DARPA,

605
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:48,560
which was every year we'd tell them what we had done.

606
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:56,560
They didn't want to hear what we wanted to do, and things have turned the opposite.

607
01:29:56,560 --> 01:30:06,560
So what would happen is every year we'd say we did these great things, and we might do some more.

608
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:14,560
It went on for about 20 years, and then it fell apart.

609
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:23,560
One thing that's a nice story, there was a great liberal senator, Mike Mansfield,

610
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:34,560
and unfortunately he got the idea that the Defense Department was getting too big and influential.

611
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:47,560
So he got Congress to pass a law that ARPA shouldn't be allowed to support anything that didn't have direct military application.

612
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:57,560
Congress went for this, and all of a sudden a lot of research disappeared, basic research.

613
01:30:57,560 --> 01:31:03,560
It didn't bother us much because we made up applications and said,

614
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:15,560
well, this will make a military robot that will go out and do something bad.

615
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:36,560
I don't remember ever writing anything at all, but anyway around 1980 the funding for that sort of thing just dried up because of this political accident.

616
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:44,560
It was just an accident that ARPA, mainly through the Office of Naval Research, was funding basic research.

617
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:48,560
That was a bit of history.

618
01:31:48,560 --> 01:32:00,560
If you look back at the year 1900 or so, you see people like Einstein making these nice theories.

619
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:14,560
But Einstein wasn't a very abstract mathematician, so he had a mathematician named Hermann Weill polishing his tensors and things for him.

620
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:24,560
And Hermann Weill's son, Joe, was at the Office of Naval Research in my early time.

621
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:45,560
That office had spent a lot of secret money getting scientists out of Europe while Hitler was marching around and sending them to places like Princeton and other forms of heaven in Cambridge.

622
01:32:45,560 --> 01:33:01,560
And again, one of the reasons I was lucky is that I was here and all these, you know, if you had a mathematical question you could find the best mathematician in the world down the block somewhere.

623
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:17,560
And Joe Weill was partly responsible for that, and the ONR was piping all that money to us for work on early AI.

624
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:31,560
So it was a very sad thing that maybe the most influential liberal in the US government actually ruined everything by accident.

625
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:48,560
ARPA changed its name to DARPA. It was Advanced Research Projects Agency, and it had to call itself Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.

626
01:33:48,560 --> 01:34:17,560
Well, Christianity wiped out science. That might happen tomorrow. Only choose your religion.

627
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:46,560
It's a hard problem. The number of people working on advanced ideas in AI has gotten smaller and smaller as the, right now the around 1980 rule-based systems became popular.

628
01:34:46,560 --> 01:35:15,560
There are lots of things to do. Right now, statistical-based inference systems are becoming popular. And as I said, these things are tremendously useful, but the problem is if you have a statistical system, the important part is guessing what are the plausible hypotheses and then making up the, then finding out how many instances of that are correlated with such and such.

629
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:29,560
So it's a nice idea, but the hard problem is the abstract symbolic problem of what sets of variables are worth considering at all when there are a lot of them.

630
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:44,560
So to me, the most exciting projects are the kind that Winston is developing for reasoning about real-life situations. And the one that Henry Lieberman, would you stand up, Henry?

631
01:35:45,560 --> 01:36:02,560
Lieberman runs a world-class group that's working on common sense knowledge and informal reasoning. And it seems to me that that's the critical thing that all the other systems will need.

632
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:16,560
In the meantime, there are people working on logical inference, which has the same problem that statistical inference has, namely, how do you guess which combinations of variables are worth thinking about?

633
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:36,560
Then it seems to me that the statistics isn't so important. In fact, there's a great researcher named Douglas Lenat in Austin, Texas, who once made an interesting AI system that was good at making predictions and guessing explanations for things.

634
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:52,560
And it was sort of like a probabilistic system. It had a lot of hypotheses, and every time one of them was useful in solving a problem, it moved it up one on the list.

635
01:36:52,560 --> 01:37:07,560
So Lenat's thing never used any numbers. It didn't say, this is successful .73 of the time, and now it's successful .7364825 of the time.

636
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:17,560
What it would do is, if something was useful, it would move it up past another hypothesis, every now and then, it would put a new one in.

637
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:30,560
Well, if you're trying to solve a problem, what do you need to know? You want to know what's the most likely to be useful one, and try that.

638
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:36,560
You don't care how likely it is to be useful, as long as it's the most, right?

639
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:50,560
I mean, if it's one in a million, maybe you should say, I'm getting out of here. I shouldn't be working in this field at all, or get a better problem.

640
01:37:50,560 --> 01:38:07,560
But Lenat's thing did rather wonderfully at making theories by just changing the ranking of the hypotheses that it was considered. No numbers.

641
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:12,560
It did something very cute.

642
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:36,560
It gave it examples of arithmetic, and it actually, this is a rather long effort, and it actually learned to do some arithmetic, and it invented the idea of division, and the idea of prime number, which was some number that wasn't divisible by anything.

643
01:38:36,560 --> 01:39:00,560
It decided that nine was a prime, didn't do much harm, and it crept along, and it got better and better, and it invented modular arithmetic by accident at some point, and it's a PhD thesis.

644
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:09,560
A lot of people didn't believe this PhD thesis because Lenat lost the program tape.

645
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:19,560
So he was under some cloud of suspicion for people thinking he might have faked it, but who cares?

646
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:36,560
Anyway, I think there's a lesson there, which is that let's start with something that works, and then if it's really good, then hire a mathematician who might be able to optimize it a little.

647
01:39:36,560 --> 01:40:02,560
But the important thing was the order, and a good statistical one might waste a lot of time because here's this one that's 0.78, and here's this one that's 0.56, and it's the next one down, and you get a lot of experience, and it goes up to 0.57 and 0.58, and it never, you know, might be a long time before it gets past the other one because you're doing arithmetic.

648
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:13,560
Whereas in Lenats, it would just pop up past the other one, and then it would get tried right away, and if it were no good, it would get knocked down again. Who cares?

649
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:38,560
So it's a real question of, I don't know, mathematics is great, and I love it, and a lot of you do, but there should be a name for when it's actually slowing you down and wasting your time because there's a better way that's not formal.

650
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:44,560
There are people who know the price of everything and the value of nothing.

651
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:46,560
Yes, that's very nice.

652
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:59,560
I know you're also a musician, so I have a music related question. What do you think is the role of music? Why do all cultures have it?

653
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:12,560
I have a paper about it. Oh, okay.

654
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:26,560
I've been trying to revise it, actually, but it's a strange question because there is music everywhere.

655
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:45,560
On the other hand, I have several friends who are A musical, and so when I have this theory that music is a way of teaching you to represent things in their orderly fashion and stuff like that,

656
01:41:46,560 --> 01:42:04,560
well, I have three of my colleagues who aren't musical, but they dance, so it may be that I don't know the answer.

657
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:28,560
The first theory in my paper is that when you have a lot of complicated things happening, then the only way to learn is to represent things that happen and then look at the differences between things that are similar and then try to explain the differences.

658
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:36,560
Right? I mean, what else is there? Maybe there's something else.

659
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:54,560
So in order to become intelligent and understand things, you have to be able to compare things, and to me the most important feature of what's called music is that it's divided into measures.

660
01:42:55,560 --> 01:43:00,560
Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba.

661
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:11,560
And measures are the same number of beats or whatever they are, and so now you can say da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da.

662
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:23,560
What's the difference? You change the eighth notes in the second one, the last four eighth notes, no, the two before last to a quarter note.

663
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:33,560
So you're taking things that were in different times, and you're superimposing those times, and now you can see the difference.

664
01:43:33,560 --> 01:43:45,560
And the reason you can see the difference is that you have things called measures, and the measures have things called beats, and so things get knocked into very good frames.

665
01:43:46,560 --> 01:44:01,560
Now there's some Indian music which has 14 measures for a phrase, and some of the measures go seven and five, and I can make no sense of that stuff whatever, and I've tried fairly hard but not very.

666
01:44:03,560 --> 01:44:06,560
So I don't understand how Indians can think.

667
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:13,560
Any of you can handle Indian music?

668
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:19,560
I just want to add on what you said about this.

669
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:33,560
My favorite quote from your paper on music-minded meaning is the one about what good is music, about how kids play with blocks to learn about space, and people play with music to learn about time.

670
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:41,560
And I think in that sense both music and dance are different ways that people can arrange things in time.

671
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:52,560
And in the sense like in proposatory music and in proposatory movement are both ways of different blocks if you will in time as opposed to space.

672
01:44:52,560 --> 01:45:06,560
Yeah, my friends who seem a-musically, maybe there's something different about their cochlea, or maybe they have absolute pitch in some sense, which is a bad thing to have.

673
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:27,560
Because if you're listening to a piece composed by a composer who doesn't have absolute pitch, then you're reading all sorts of things into the music that shouldn't be there, and the opposite would be true.

674
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:41,560
I read music criticism sometimes, and maybe the reviewer says, and after the second and third movement, he finally returns to the initial key of E flat major. What a relief.

675
01:45:43,560 --> 01:45:54,560
Well, I once had absolute pitch for a couple of weeks, because I ran a tuning fork in my room for a month.

676
01:45:55,560 --> 01:46:07,560
And I didn't like it, because you can't listen to Bach anymore.

677
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:26,560
Oh, well. It's a good question. Why do people like music? And I don't know any other paper like mine. If you ever find one, I'd like to see it, because if you go to a big library, there are thousands of books about music.

678
01:46:27,560 --> 01:46:37,560
And if you open one, it's mostly Berlioz complaining that somebody wouldn't give him enough money to hire a big enough chorus.

679
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:46,560
I've found very few books about music itself. Yes.

680
01:46:47,560 --> 01:46:58,560
Do you think that having a body is a necessary component of having a mind?

681
01:46:59,560 --> 01:47:08,560
Could you do just as well a simulated creature?

682
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:11,560
Oh, sure. You could have all things.

683
01:47:11,560 --> 01:47:21,560
Simulation? I think a mind that's not in a world wouldn't have much to do. It would have to invent the world.

684
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:31,560
And I don't see why it couldn't, but you might have to give it a start, like the idea of three or four dimensions.

685
01:47:39,560 --> 01:47:43,560
Can't you? What happens if you sit back and just think for a while?

686
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:51,560
You wouldn't know if your body had disappeared, would you?

687
01:47:57,560 --> 01:48:02,560
There are also some strange ideas about existence and...

688
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:10,560
Why do you think there's a world?

689
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:17,560
One of the things that bugs me is people say, well, who created it?

690
01:48:17,560 --> 01:48:22,560
And that can't make any sense, because this is just a possible world.

691
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:27,560
Suppose there are a whole lot of possible worlds, and there's one real one.

692
01:48:27,560 --> 01:48:31,560
How could you ever, how could you possibly know which one you're in?

693
01:48:31,560 --> 01:48:37,560
And then you could say, well, didn't someone have to make it?

694
01:48:37,560 --> 01:48:40,560
And what's the next thing you'd ask?

695
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:44,560
Well, who made the maker?

696
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:54,560
So the body-mind thing seems to me that once you have a computer, it can be its own world.

697
01:48:54,560 --> 01:49:07,560
The program can spend half the time simulating a world and half the time thinking about what it's like to be in it.

698
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:10,560
Yeah?

699
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:15,560
Yes, it's an empty concept.

700
01:49:15,560 --> 01:49:23,560
It's all right to say this bottle exists because let's say this bottle is in this universe.

701
01:49:23,560 --> 01:49:28,560
But what would it mean to say the universe exists?

702
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:31,560
The universe is in the universe?

703
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:40,560
So there's something wrong with thinking about, so there are only possible worlds.

704
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:47,560
There's no, it doesn't make any sense to pick one of them out and say that's the real one.

705
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:53,560
Yeah, but existence is relative.

706
01:49:53,560 --> 01:50:00,560
Yeah, you don't say this is the world I'm in, but you shouldn't say that doesn't mean it exists.

707
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:04,560
Like, two is in the set of even numbers.

708
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:07,560
What's the set of even numbers in?

709
01:50:07,560 --> 01:50:09,560
It doesn't stop anywhere.

710
01:50:09,560 --> 01:50:11,560
Yeah, lots of words.

711
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:14,560
So is mathematics or is it only worlds?

712
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:21,560
But physics explains the current world or are there no variables to use at this time?

713
01:50:21,560 --> 01:50:26,560
Well, you can't tell because five minutes from now, everything might change.

714
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:30,560
So nothing ever explains anything.

715
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:36,560
You just have to take what you've got and make the best of it.

716
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:37,560
Yeah?

717
01:50:37,560 --> 01:50:43,560
Solutions are between systems, knowledge, and visual intelligence.

718
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:44,560
Which knowledge?

719
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:51,560
Like systems, basically, in general.

720
01:50:51,560 --> 01:50:57,560
Well, there are people who talk about systems theory, but I'm not sure that it's well-defined.

721
01:50:57,560 --> 01:51:06,560
Artificial intelligence means, to me, making a system that is resourceful and doesn't get stuck.

722
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:18,560
And so if you have a system, and also it's a, how do you put it?

723
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:21,560
Some definitions are not stationary.

724
01:51:21,560 --> 01:51:29,560
Like, what's popular?

725
01:51:29,560 --> 01:51:34,560
Popular is what's popular now.

726
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:39,560
There isn't any such thing as popular music in terms of the music.

727
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:49,560
I know there were, there was once a little department called Systems Analysis at Tufts,

728
01:51:49,560 --> 01:51:56,560
which had a couple of rather good philosophers trying to make general theory of everything.

729
01:51:56,560 --> 01:52:06,560
And they were writing nice little papers and it got, it moved along.

730
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:14,560
But then there was a Senator McCarthy you've probably heard of, and he announced that,

731
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:26,560
he had evidence that the, one of the principal investigators had slept with his wife before they were married.

732
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:34,560
Well, Tufts was very frightened at this and abolished that department.

733
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:43,560
And Bill Schutts went to California and started Eselin and had a good time for the next 50 years.

734
01:52:43,560 --> 01:52:48,560
I don't know, more stories.

735
01:52:48,560 --> 01:52:50,560
Yeah.

736
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:55,560
Kind of was an extension of the body and mind question.

737
01:52:55,560 --> 01:53:02,560
It seems to me like we as humans, we learn a lot from just interacting with the environment.

738
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:08,560
Like language and hearing, being spoken, we speak it, you know, we see things, we touch things.

739
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:14,560
But it, as far as I know, a lot of the efforts in artificial intelligence so far have been

740
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:20,560
confined to the computer that does not go out into the real world,

741
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:25,560
and direct doesn't kind of turn to bitlessly learn new things.

742
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:28,560
Well, here's the problem.

743
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:32,560
I look over at Carnegie Mellon and there are some nice projects.

744
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:37,560
And the most popular one is robot soccer.

745
01:53:37,560 --> 01:53:41,560
And here are these little robots kicking a ball around.

746
01:53:41,560 --> 01:53:46,560
They're Sony, what are they called?

747
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:49,560
Yes, the Sony iBos.

748
01:53:49,560 --> 01:54:03,560
Sony stopped making the iBos, but it respected Carnegie and it made a little secret stash of iBos to send to Carnegie when the present ones break.

749
01:54:03,560 --> 01:54:16,560
But my impression of AI projects that have robots is that they do less, less, less than projects that don't.

750
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:27,560
The reason is, if you have a robot like ASIMO, made by Sony, no, Honda,

751
01:54:27,560 --> 01:54:36,560
ASIMO can get in the backseat of a car with some effort, usually falls over.

752
01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:43,560
However, if you simulate a stick figure in a computer getting into a stick figure of a car,

753
01:54:43,560 --> 01:54:47,560
then you can make it learn to do that and get better and better.

754
01:54:47,560 --> 01:54:55,560
And so all AI projects without robots are way ahead of all AI projects with robots.

755
01:54:55,560 --> 01:55:02,560
And the profound reason is that robots are usually expensive and they're always being fixed.

756
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:07,560
We have five students and the robot is being fixed.

757
01:55:07,560 --> 01:55:11,560
I don't know what they're doing, but they have to wait.

758
01:55:11,560 --> 01:55:19,560
Whereas if you have a stick figure robot, then you can just run it on this,

759
01:55:19,560 --> 01:55:23,560
although it might be a little slower than your mainframe.

760
01:55:23,560 --> 01:55:28,560
Probably not.

761
01:55:29,560 --> 01:55:35,560
Here's the theory that I just thought of.

762
01:55:35,560 --> 01:55:42,560
The idea of the body as a scene in abstract, basically a mechanism for input output.

763
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:48,560
It's a set of sensors from which our brains can get information about the world

764
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:52,560
and a set of actuators in which we can display our state.

765
01:55:53,560 --> 01:56:01,560
In that light, it's almost as if our brains are really independent on our body itself.

766
01:56:01,560 --> 01:56:05,560
It can adapt to any sort of body if we haven't hooked it up that way.

767
01:56:05,560 --> 01:56:09,560
It just so happens that we've been hooked up to this body since birth,

768
01:56:09,560 --> 01:56:14,560
that we have such good mental models of how to use this body.

769
01:56:14,560 --> 01:56:20,560
I guess an example from experiments that support this theory might be

770
01:56:20,560 --> 01:56:23,560
how when people have limbs amputated,

771
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:27,560
it takes them a while to forget that they have the limb

772
01:56:27,560 --> 01:56:32,560
because their mental models still exist and their mental models don't go away overnight.

773
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:37,560
Also, I guess they train monkeys to control robot arms with their brains.

774
01:56:37,560 --> 01:56:39,560
Sure.

775
01:56:39,560 --> 01:56:48,560
Well, but it just seems to me that a large amount of our brain is involved

776
01:56:48,560 --> 01:56:54,560
with highly evolved locomotion mechanisms.

777
01:56:54,560 --> 01:57:02,560
And as I said, when you're sitting back with your eyes closed in a chair

778
01:57:02,560 --> 01:57:10,560
thinking about something, then it's not clear how much of that machinery is important.

779
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:20,560
But it might be that I have a strange paper on...

780
01:57:21,560 --> 01:57:28,560
I don't know if it's...

781
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:38,560
I'm trying to remember its name. It's called...

782
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:58,560
I can actually get a...

783
01:57:58,560 --> 01:58:06,560
I can't remember the name of the title.

784
01:58:06,560 --> 01:58:11,560
Oh, I give up.

785
01:58:11,560 --> 01:58:20,560
The idea is that maybe in the older theories of psychology,

786
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:24,560
everything is learned by experience in the real world.

787
01:58:24,560 --> 01:58:32,560
So conditioning and reinforcement and so forth.

788
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:36,560
In this theory, I call internal grounding.

789
01:58:36,560 --> 01:58:38,560
I make a conjecture.

790
01:58:38,560 --> 01:58:42,560
Suppose the brain has a little piece of nerve tissue,

791
01:58:42,560 --> 01:58:49,560
which consists of a few neurons arranged to make...

792
01:58:49,560 --> 01:58:53,560
not a flip-flop, but a...

793
01:58:53,560 --> 01:58:56,560
what would you call a three or a four-flop?

794
01:58:56,560 --> 01:58:58,560
A flip-flop with three or four states.

795
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:00,560
Let's say three.

796
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:06,560
If you put a certain input, it goes from...

797
01:59:06,560 --> 01:59:12,560
I couldn't find the chalk.

798
01:59:12,560 --> 01:59:15,560
So here are three states.

799
01:59:15,560 --> 01:59:17,560
And here's a certain input.

800
01:59:17,560 --> 01:59:20,560
That means if you're in that state, you go to this.

801
01:59:20,560 --> 01:59:26,560
And if you pop that input again, it does this.

802
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:33,560
And if you say, go counterclockwise, it goes...

803
01:59:33,560 --> 01:59:36,560
So three of them get you back where you were.

804
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:41,560
But if I go this, this, and that,

805
01:59:41,560 --> 01:59:47,560
that would mean to go like this, this, and back.

806
01:59:47,560 --> 01:59:49,560
So this would be...

807
01:59:49,560 --> 01:59:53,560
that means that's equivalent to just going one.

808
01:59:53,560 --> 01:59:55,560
Get the idea?

809
01:59:55,560 --> 01:59:59,560
Imagine that there's a little world inside your brain,

810
01:59:59,560 --> 02:00:02,560
which is very small and only has three states.

811
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:05,560
And you have actions that you can perform on it.

812
02:00:05,560 --> 02:00:07,560
And you have an inner eye,

813
02:00:07,560 --> 02:00:12,560
which can see which of the three points of that triangle you're on.

814
02:00:12,560 --> 02:00:15,560
Then you could learn by experience

815
02:00:15,560 --> 02:00:19,560
that if you go left, left, left, you're back where you were.

816
02:00:19,560 --> 02:00:23,560
But if you go left, right, left, right, you're back where you are.

817
02:00:23,560 --> 02:00:28,560
And if you go left, left, right, that's like going one left.

818
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:32,560
In other words, you could imagine a brain

819
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:37,560
that starts out before it connects itself to the real world.

820
02:00:37,560 --> 02:00:43,560
It starts by having the top level of the brain

821
02:00:43,560 --> 02:00:45,560
connected to a little internal world,

822
02:00:45,560 --> 02:00:48,560
which just has three or four states.

823
02:00:48,560 --> 02:00:51,560
And you get very good at manipulating that.

824
02:00:51,560 --> 02:00:55,560
Then you add more sensory systems to the outer world,

825
02:00:55,560 --> 02:01:01,560
and you get to learn ways to get around in the real world.

826
02:01:01,560 --> 02:01:05,560
So I call that the internal grounding hypothesis.

827
02:01:05,560 --> 02:01:12,560
And my suggestion is maybe somewhere in the human brain,

828
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:15,560
there's a little structure that's somewhat like that,

829
02:01:15,560 --> 02:01:20,560
which is used by the frontal part of the cortex

830
02:01:20,560 --> 02:01:24,560
to make very abstract ideas.

831
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:27,560
You understand, the more abstract an idea is,

832
02:01:27,560 --> 02:01:31,560
the simpler and more stupid an elementary it is.

833
02:01:31,560 --> 02:01:33,560
Abstract doesn't mean hard.

834
02:01:33,560 --> 02:01:36,560
Abstract means stupid.

835
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:43,560
Real things like this are infinitely complicated.

836
02:01:43,560 --> 02:01:49,560
So we might have, and I wouldn't dare suggest this to a neuroscientist,

837
02:01:49,560 --> 02:01:54,560
there might be some little brain center somewhere near the frontal cortex

838
02:01:54,560 --> 02:02:00,560
that allows the frontal cortex to do some predicting and planning

839
02:02:00,560 --> 02:02:05,560
and induction about very simple,

840
02:02:05,560 --> 02:02:09,560
few simple finite state arrangements.

841
02:02:09,560 --> 02:02:12,560
Who knows?

842
02:02:12,560 --> 02:02:15,560
Would you look for it?

843
02:02:15,560 --> 02:02:17,560
Well, if you were a neuroscientist, you could say,

844
02:02:17,560 --> 02:02:21,560
oh, that's completely different from anything I ever heard.

845
02:02:21,560 --> 02:02:23,560
Let's look for it.

846
02:02:23,560 --> 02:02:27,560
And if you're wrong, you're wasted a year,

847
02:02:27,560 --> 02:02:38,560
and if you're right, then you become the new Ramoni Kahal or someone.

848
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:46,560
Who's the currently best neuroscientist?

849
02:02:47,560 --> 02:02:52,560
Maybe it's late.

850
02:02:52,560 --> 02:02:55,560
One more question.

851
02:02:55,560 --> 02:03:07,560
One last question.

852
02:03:07,560 --> 02:03:14,560
This is Cynthia Salman, who's one of the great developers of the logo language.

853
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:17,560
Hey.

854
02:03:17,560 --> 02:03:19,560
Yes?

855
02:03:19,560 --> 02:03:24,560
Maybe it's that question for me.

856
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:32,560
What do you think about theories such as Ramoni's theories

857
02:03:32,560 --> 02:03:35,560
that speak of no same thing?

858
02:03:35,560 --> 02:03:37,560
Completely weird.

859
02:03:37,560 --> 02:03:41,560
Obviously, those theories have nothing to do with human thinking,

860
02:03:41,560 --> 02:03:44,560
but they're very good for making stupid robots,

861
02:03:44,560 --> 02:03:52,560
and the vacuum cleaner is one of the great achievements of the century.

862
02:03:52,560 --> 02:03:56,560
However, his projects, what was it called?

863
02:03:56,560 --> 02:04:02,560
Cog disappeared without a trace.

864
02:04:02,560 --> 02:04:07,560
That theory was so wrong that it got a national award,

865
02:04:07,560 --> 02:04:11,560
and it corrupted AI research in Japan for several years.

866
02:04:11,560 --> 02:04:13,560
I can't understand.

867
02:04:13,560 --> 02:04:16,560
Brooks became popular because he said,

868
02:04:16,560 --> 02:04:21,560
maybe the important things about thinking is that there's no internal representation.

869
02:04:21,560 --> 02:04:24,560
You're just reacting to situations,

870
02:04:24,560 --> 02:04:29,560
and you have a big library of how to react to each situation.

871
02:04:29,560 --> 02:04:34,560
Well, David Hume had that idea,

872
02:04:34,560 --> 02:04:39,560
and he was a popular philosopher for hundreds of years,

873
02:04:39,560 --> 02:04:44,560
but it went nowhere, and it's gone, and so is Rod.

874
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:48,560
However, he is one of the great robot designers,

875
02:04:48,560 --> 02:04:58,560
and he may be the instrumental in fixing the great Japanese nuclear meltdown,

876
02:04:58,560 --> 02:05:02,560
because they're shipping some of his robots out there.

877
02:05:02,560 --> 02:05:06,560
The problem is, can it open the door?

878
02:05:06,560 --> 02:05:12,560
So far, no robot can open the door, even though it's not locked.

879
02:05:12,560 --> 02:05:15,560
I usually start by asking if there are any questions,

880
02:05:15,560 --> 02:05:19,560
but I thought I'd say a few things about chapter one,

881
02:05:19,560 --> 02:05:23,560
and then see if there are any questions.

882
02:05:23,560 --> 02:05:26,560
I can't see the pointer.

883
02:05:26,560 --> 02:05:40,560
Oh, anybody remember how to get word to make its pointer not disappear?

884
02:05:40,560 --> 02:05:43,560
Maybe I mentioned this in the first lecture,

885
02:05:43,560 --> 02:05:56,560
but I was taken by this cute poem by Dorothy Parker,

886
02:05:56,560 --> 02:06:04,560
because the first chapter was about love and stuff like that.

887
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:08,560
So I tried to get the rights to reproduce it,

888
02:06:08,560 --> 02:06:13,560
and it turned out that she was angry at all her friends.

889
02:06:13,560 --> 02:06:18,560
She must have been a perpetually pissed off person,

890
02:06:18,560 --> 02:06:25,560
and so she left all her literary rights to the NAACP,

891
02:06:25,560 --> 02:06:30,560
and I called them up for hours, and they couldn't find the rights.

892
02:06:30,560 --> 02:06:38,560
So finally, so it's in the version of the Emotion Machine on the web,

893
02:06:38,560 --> 02:06:48,560
but I had to resort to Shakespeare to replace her.

894
02:06:48,560 --> 02:06:51,560
Shakespeare's a slightly better poet,

895
02:06:52,560 --> 02:07:01,560
he's not as funny as Dorothy Parker.

896
02:07:01,560 --> 02:07:05,560
So the first chapter starts out,

897
02:07:05,560 --> 02:07:11,560
it's mostly about all the things we don't understand about the mind,

898
02:07:11,560 --> 02:07:15,560
which is almost everything,

899
02:07:15,560 --> 02:07:24,560
and the first discussion is, well the whole chapter is making fun of the most popular ideas,

900
02:07:24,560 --> 02:07:34,560
and the most popular idea of the mind is that people think that they're not doing the thinking,

901
02:07:34,560 --> 02:07:38,560
but there's something inside them that's doing the thinking.

902
02:07:38,560 --> 02:07:49,560
And it's this idea that there's a self is embedded in just about everything we say and think,

903
02:07:49,560 --> 02:07:53,560
and really it's hard to see how you would do without it.

904
02:07:53,560 --> 02:07:58,560
But if you ask what is the self,

905
02:07:58,560 --> 02:08:01,560
then since this idea is so popular,

906
02:08:01,560 --> 02:08:08,560
people begin to believe that there is such a thing and it takes all sorts of various forms,

907
02:08:08,560 --> 02:08:16,560
and the most dangerous form maybe is the one that religions exploit,

908
02:08:16,560 --> 02:08:21,560
which is that inside a person with all their complications,

909
02:08:21,560 --> 02:08:27,560
there's a little pure essence called the soul or the self or whatever you want to call it,

910
02:08:27,560 --> 02:08:37,560
and it's impossible to describe it or explain it in physical terms,

911
02:08:37,560 --> 02:08:45,560
and so that is one of the reasons why we think there are two worlds,

912
02:08:45,560 --> 02:08:50,560
a physical world and lots of other kinds of worlds.

913
02:08:50,560 --> 02:09:03,560
Each of us has some imaginary model of what they are and what they're in,

914
02:09:03,560 --> 02:09:08,560
and philosophers talk about it and existentialists and so on.

915
02:09:08,560 --> 02:09:13,560
So there are lots of problems about our ideas, about ourselves,

916
02:09:13,560 --> 02:09:19,560
and in reading around for half my life,

917
02:09:19,560 --> 02:09:26,560
I was puzzled at the strange ideas that are around,

918
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:34,560
and in Aristotle, I find the first intelligible theories of mind and emotions.

919
02:09:34,560 --> 02:09:40,560
So if you look at particular Aristotle's, there are a number of books,

920
02:09:40,560 --> 02:09:43,560
and one of them is called Rhetoric,

921
02:09:43,560 --> 02:09:49,560
and it's full of theories about how people reason and influence each other,

922
02:09:49,560 --> 02:09:58,560
and I'll show you some quotes from that,

923
02:09:58,560 --> 02:10:05,560
because when I look at the history that I've encountered about psychology,

924
02:10:05,560 --> 02:10:11,560
Aristotle stands out as being the first and among the best,

925
02:10:11,560 --> 02:10:17,560
and as far as I can see, there were no psychologists nearly as good as him.

926
02:10:17,560 --> 02:10:21,560
Of course, we don't know whether there was a him exactly,

927
02:10:21,560 --> 02:10:26,560
because what we have of Aristotle is a lot of writing,

928
02:10:26,560 --> 02:10:32,560
but it's all cobbled together by students from all sorts of manuscripts by other people

929
02:10:32,560 --> 02:10:39,560
and people who took notes, and Aristotle claims to have learned a lot from Plato.

930
02:10:39,560 --> 02:10:44,560
We have very little writing from him,

931
02:10:44,560 --> 02:10:53,560
and so there you go, three centuries before the Christian era, as it's called,

932
02:10:53,560 --> 02:10:58,560
and then a couple of thousand years later,

933
02:10:58,560 --> 02:11:09,560
we start to find people like Spinoza and Kant and John Locke and David Hume

934
02:11:09,560 --> 02:11:13,560
who start to make psychology theories,

935
02:11:13,560 --> 02:11:21,560
very little of which is as good as the ones that Aristotle has in all his fragments.

936
02:11:21,560 --> 02:11:28,560
So one question that frequently bothers me and should bother everyone is

937
02:11:28,560 --> 02:11:32,560
why did science disappear for a thousand years,

938
02:11:32,560 --> 02:11:42,560
and the standard explanation is the rise of the great religions,

939
02:11:42,560 --> 02:11:49,560
and why did it come back, and you see with the first signs of anything like modern science,

940
02:11:49,560 --> 02:11:53,560
at least in my view, with Galileo and Newton.

941
02:11:53,560 --> 02:11:56,560
There are a couple of people before that.

942
02:11:56,560 --> 02:12:02,560
There are some people in the Muslim world who invented some high school algebra,

943
02:12:02,560 --> 02:12:05,560
and they make a big fuss about that.

944
02:12:05,560 --> 02:12:13,560
It looks like Archimedes, in a very recently discovered manuscript,

945
02:12:13,560 --> 02:12:15,560
computed in integral.

946
02:12:15,560 --> 02:12:24,560
He found the volume of a cone, which is, what is it, 1, 6th, B, H, I forget.

947
02:12:24,560 --> 02:12:30,560
Anyway, so why did science disappear,

948
02:12:30,560 --> 02:12:33,560
and why did psychology appear so late?

949
02:12:33,560 --> 02:12:39,560
Because there isn't much psychology in the modern sense until 1900,

950
02:12:39,560 --> 02:12:49,560
or the late 1800s, with Francis Galton and William James lived around here,

951
02:12:49,560 --> 02:13:00,560
and Rudolf Fleiss, who, Sigmund Freud, starts writing in 1895.

952
02:13:00,560 --> 02:13:05,560
People make fun of Freud, as I mentioned last week,

953
02:13:05,560 --> 02:13:10,560
but in fact, among other things,

954
02:13:10,560 --> 02:13:13,560
how many of you have read the recent criticisms of Freud,

955
02:13:13,560 --> 02:13:20,560
which claim that he was complete faker and never cured a single patient?

956
02:13:20,560 --> 02:13:22,560
This is popular stuff.

957
02:13:22,560 --> 02:13:27,560
I don't believe Freud ever really claimed to cure a single patient.

958
02:13:27,560 --> 02:13:31,560
So the critics, who are really very ferocious,

959
02:13:31,560 --> 02:13:35,560
claim that he made up all his data and so forth.

960
02:13:35,560 --> 02:13:41,560
But most of what Freud says is that psychoanalysis might be a good way

961
02:13:41,560 --> 02:13:46,560
to find out what you're really thinking and discover more about yourself

962
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:50,560
and your goals and so forth.

963
02:13:50,560 --> 02:13:59,560
I had the good or bad luck to be introduced to L. Ron Hubbard when I was an undergraduate.

964
02:13:59,560 --> 02:14:04,560
John Campbell was the great editor of the, I think it was called,

965
02:14:04,560 --> 02:14:07,560
The Stounding Science Fiction in those days.

966
02:14:07,560 --> 02:14:09,560
What a marvelous title.

967
02:14:09,560 --> 02:14:16,560
And this fairly mediocre science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard

968
02:14:16,560 --> 02:14:22,560
invented a new form of psychiatry called...

969
02:14:22,560 --> 02:14:24,560
What was it called?

970
02:14:24,560 --> 02:14:27,560
Dianetics.

971
02:14:27,560 --> 02:14:29,560
It's pretty good.

972
02:14:29,560 --> 02:14:34,560
And I'll tell you that story another time.

973
02:14:34,560 --> 02:14:41,560
But John Campbell had Thanksgiving in the Commander Hotel every year

974
02:14:41,560 --> 02:14:44,560
and invited a bunch of friends.

975
02:14:44,560 --> 02:14:50,560
And I don't remember if that's how I got to meet Asimov and Heinlein and other people.

976
02:14:50,560 --> 02:14:57,560
But anyway, I did and science fiction had a big influence on me from my...

977
02:14:57,560 --> 02:15:05,560
Actually, early years, but starting in college, it got very serious.

978
02:15:05,560 --> 02:15:18,560
Anyway, so chapter one starts to talk about this phenomenon of psychology

979
02:15:18,560 --> 02:15:27,560
and one of the funny parts is this little section three, 1.3,

980
02:15:27,560 --> 02:15:31,560
of trying to say what are emotions.

981
02:15:31,560 --> 02:15:37,560
And I looked up emotions in dictionaries and can you all read that?

982
02:15:37,560 --> 02:15:43,560
I don't feel like reading aloud.

983
02:15:44,560 --> 02:15:50,560
There's lots of discussion of emotions and how mysterious and complex they are.

984
02:15:50,560 --> 02:15:59,560
And then the marvelous thing is how many words there are for emotional states.

985
02:15:59,560 --> 02:16:02,560
I think I got 300, but I don't remember.

986
02:16:02,560 --> 02:16:06,560
Anyway, here's from A to D.

987
02:16:06,560 --> 02:16:12,560
And I don't recall how I found those, but I think...

988
02:16:12,560 --> 02:16:15,560
But that's a lot.

989
02:16:15,560 --> 02:16:22,560
How many words for ways to think are there?

990
02:16:22,560 --> 02:16:30,560
Now, that's a serious question because I complained maybe on the next page.

991
02:16:30,560 --> 02:16:33,560
No, I didn't.

992
02:16:33,560 --> 02:16:38,560
I found myself complaining that there were very few words for ways to think.

993
02:16:38,560 --> 02:16:42,560
And then this afternoon when I was pruning these slides,

994
02:16:42,560 --> 02:16:45,560
it occurred to me that I didn't really try.

995
02:16:45,560 --> 02:16:52,560
So maybe I just didn't think enough.

996
02:16:52,560 --> 02:16:58,560
So if there are a couple of hundred words for everyday emotions,

997
02:16:58,560 --> 02:17:04,560
if any of you can find me a list of 10 or 20 common words for styles of thinking,

998
02:17:04,560 --> 02:17:12,560
I'd appreciate it because I wonder if there are a lot and if not, why not?

999
02:17:12,560 --> 02:17:24,560
So here's a list of typical situations, grieving for a lost child,

1000
02:17:24,560 --> 02:17:27,560
panic at being in an enclosed space.

1001
02:17:27,560 --> 02:17:33,560
I'm not sure any of the words in the list of 300 standard emotions

1002
02:17:33,560 --> 02:17:41,560
are good enough to describe how you feel for any of these not unusual states.

1003
02:17:41,560 --> 02:17:46,560
Have you ever lost control of your car at high speed?

1004
02:17:46,560 --> 02:17:51,560
No, but when I first learned to drive, I couldn't believe that you could read signs

1005
02:17:51,560 --> 02:17:59,560
at the same time as...

1006
02:17:59,560 --> 02:18:06,560
Well, anyway, one of the very best psychologists in history,

1007
02:18:06,560 --> 02:18:12,560
or a pair of psychologists, aren't even cold psychologists.

1008
02:18:12,560 --> 02:18:18,560
These are two guys named Conrad Lorenz and Nico Tinbergen,

1009
02:18:18,560 --> 02:18:21,560
and somebody made up the word ethology.

1010
02:18:21,560 --> 02:18:24,560
What they study is the behavior of animals,

1011
02:18:24,560 --> 02:18:29,560
and in some sense, presumably they're studying the psychology of animals

1012
02:18:29,560 --> 02:18:36,560
because just as with a person, when somebody flies into a rage,

1013
02:18:36,560 --> 02:18:38,560
you're not describing their mental state,

1014
02:18:38,560 --> 02:18:42,560
you're describing something about how they behave.

1015
02:18:42,560 --> 02:18:45,560
So the ethologists, too, are psychologists,

1016
02:18:45,560 --> 02:18:52,560
and Tinbergen and Lorenz, starting around 1920s,

1017
02:18:52,560 --> 02:19:00,560
started to analyze the behavior of animals in great detail.

1018
02:19:00,560 --> 02:19:06,560
So here's an example of how a certain fish behaves.

1019
02:19:06,560 --> 02:19:12,560
I actually forgot which fish it is, but there's a picture of it in the book.

1020
02:19:12,560 --> 02:19:19,560
And at different points in its life, it's in different phases,

1021
02:19:19,560 --> 02:19:27,560
and this is just one diagram of a dozen for this particular fish,

1022
02:19:27,560 --> 02:19:34,560
and its reproduction, which involves an environment with plants and other things,

1023
02:19:34,560 --> 02:19:40,560
and he divides its behavior into parenting, courtship, nesting and fighting,

1024
02:19:40,560 --> 02:19:46,560
and then you see each of those has a lot of subdivisions.

1025
02:19:46,560 --> 02:19:53,560
And Tinbergen and Lorenz and some students discovered all these things

1026
02:19:53,560 --> 02:19:59,560
by sitting in front of fish tanks and watching the fish for months and years.

1027
02:19:59,560 --> 02:20:08,560
Tinbergen also spent years on some beach watching seagulls,

1028
02:20:08,560 --> 02:20:18,560
and so he has a diagram like this for a particular class of seagulls.

1029
02:20:18,560 --> 02:20:28,560
When I came to Boston, my friends and I used to go to Nahant,

1030
02:20:28,560 --> 02:20:33,560
and look at these tide pools there where there are a lot of activities,

1031
02:20:33,560 --> 02:20:37,560
and it was very interesting, and I got a big fish tank

1032
02:20:37,560 --> 02:20:45,560
and imported all sorts of little animals and plants from the tide pools in Nahant,

1033
02:20:45,560 --> 02:20:50,560
and I watched them for about a year and didn't learn anything.

1034
02:20:51,560 --> 02:21:00,560
That was before I read Tinbergen, and then I realized there's something about those people,

1035
02:21:00,560 --> 02:21:04,560
which is they could watch a fish and recognize all sorts of behaviors,

1036
02:21:04,560 --> 02:21:08,560
and I would just watch a fish and wonder whether it was hungry,

1037
02:21:08,560 --> 02:21:15,560
or wouldn't you get bored swimming back and forth for three years in this.

1038
02:21:16,560 --> 02:21:23,560
Anyway, so here are the great psychologists of our day, Aristotle,

1039
02:21:23,560 --> 02:21:30,560
two thousand years ago, and Lorenz and Tinbergen in the 1930s,

1040
02:21:30,560 --> 02:21:39,560
and Sigmund Freud and Galton and William James around 1900,

1041
02:21:39,560 --> 02:21:42,560
and then what went wrong?

1042
02:21:42,560 --> 02:21:47,560
There's almost no good psychology between then and 1950s

1043
02:21:47,560 --> 02:21:51,560
when something called cognitive psychology started,

1044
02:21:51,560 --> 02:21:56,560
and it was partly due to people who said,

1045
02:21:56,560 --> 02:22:00,560
let's make psychology more scientific,

1046
02:22:00,560 --> 02:22:04,560
and you've probably all heard of Pavlov or Watson,

1047
02:22:04,560 --> 02:22:09,560
and what happened is around 1900, some psychologists said,

1048
02:22:09,560 --> 02:22:14,560
well, these Galton's and Freud's and William James are very poetic

1049
02:22:14,560 --> 02:22:19,560
and expressive and literary, and they write much better than we do

1050
02:22:19,560 --> 02:22:23,560
and tell good stories, but they're not scientists,

1051
02:22:23,560 --> 02:22:26,560
and they don't do reproducible experiments.

1052
02:22:26,560 --> 02:22:31,560
So what we have to do is simplify the situation to find the basic laws of behavior.

1053
02:22:31,560 --> 02:22:36,560
So let's take a pigeon and put it in a vacuum in the dark.

1054
02:22:36,560 --> 02:22:44,560
Well, they didn't go that far, but they did put it in the dark,

1055
02:22:44,560 --> 02:22:49,560
and there were two illuminated levers to work,

1056
02:22:49,560 --> 02:22:54,560
and you could make a sound, and the sound could be very annoying,

1057
02:22:54,560 --> 02:22:59,560
or you could have a right, annoying flashing light or something,

1058
02:22:59,560 --> 02:23:02,560
and the animal would push one of two levers,

1059
02:23:02,560 --> 02:23:07,560
and one of them would make the stimulus even more annoying,

1060
02:23:07,560 --> 02:23:11,560
and one of them would make it go away,

1061
02:23:11,560 --> 02:23:16,560
and you'd plot curves of how often the animal pressed these levers,

1062
02:23:16,560 --> 02:23:20,560
so you would get a quantitative theory of how much it learned

1063
02:23:20,560 --> 02:23:24,560
and how much it could remember and how many trials it would have to do,

1064
02:23:24,560 --> 02:23:31,560
and then instead of just looking at reactions to stimuli,

1065
02:23:31,560 --> 02:23:39,560
quickly switch to trying to teach the animal things by giving it two alternatives,

1066
02:23:39,560 --> 02:23:44,560
turn left or turn right, or push this button or that or whatever,

1067
02:23:44,560 --> 02:23:49,560
and if they pushed the one you approve of, then you'd give them a little pellet of food,

1068
02:23:49,560 --> 02:23:56,560
and there was a lot of engineering so that you would make sure that the food got to them right away,

1069
02:23:56,560 --> 02:24:02,560
because if there were a 10-second delay between an action and a reward,

1070
02:24:02,560 --> 02:24:08,560
the pigeon or a squirrel or a rat or a cat or a dog would learn much less quickly

1071
02:24:08,560 --> 02:24:11,560
than if there was a one-second delay,

1072
02:24:11,560 --> 02:24:20,560
and anyway, that went on for 50 years, starting around 1900, Pavlov and his dogs,

1073
02:24:20,560 --> 02:24:27,560
and there's a great movie that some guy came around with that had been taken of Pavlov's lab,

1074
02:24:27,560 --> 02:24:34,560
and it shows sort of like a great dictator or something.

1075
02:24:34,560 --> 02:24:39,560
There's this room with a lot of cages and dogs and mostly dogs in this case,

1076
02:24:39,560 --> 02:24:43,560
and Pavlov comes in and there are a bunch of lackeys who sort of bow and scrape,

1077
02:24:43,560 --> 02:24:47,560
because he's a lord, and he comes in,

1078
02:24:47,560 --> 02:24:53,560
and all the dogs run into the corner of their cage and yelp.

1079
02:24:53,560 --> 02:25:01,560
So the Pavlovians tried pretty hard to get that movie suppressed,

1080
02:25:01,560 --> 02:25:07,560
and I haven't seen it in recent years,

1081
02:25:07,560 --> 02:25:20,560
but anyway, Fred Skinner, who was a professor when I was an undergraduate at Harvard,

1082
02:25:20,560 --> 02:25:26,560
was the first one to really automate this experimental psychology,

1083
02:25:26,560 --> 02:25:29,560
and he invented what's called a Skinner box,

1084
02:25:29,560 --> 02:25:36,560
but it's just a soundproof, lightproof, well ventilated and thermally regulated cage,

1085
02:25:36,560 --> 02:25:42,560
and you can put a rat or a pigeon, those are the most common animals.

1086
02:25:42,560 --> 02:25:47,560
They're very inexpensive because they're free.

1087
02:25:47,560 --> 02:25:55,560
No one knows much about dolphins.

1088
02:25:55,560 --> 02:26:00,560
They've been studied for 50 years, whenever, John, what's his name?

1089
02:26:00,560 --> 02:26:05,560
Remember the name of the great dolphin?

1090
02:26:05,560 --> 02:26:07,560
Lily, thanks.

1091
02:26:07,560 --> 02:26:14,560
He discovered a lot about dolphins, and a certain amount about their communication,

1092
02:26:14,560 --> 02:26:20,560
and a little bit about whales, but there's an interesting mystery.

1093
02:26:20,560 --> 02:26:26,560
I forget which whales, but some whales have a 20-minute song,

1094
02:26:26,560 --> 02:26:32,560
and they repeat it for a whole season, and next year that song is a little bit different,

1095
02:26:32,560 --> 02:26:38,560
but it goes essentially without repeating, it's very complicated for 20 minutes,

1096
02:26:38,560 --> 02:26:47,560
and people have studied that a lot, and no one has the slightest idea of what it means,

1097
02:26:47,560 --> 02:26:51,560
and nobody even has any good conjectures, which bothers me.

1098
02:26:51,560 --> 02:26:58,560
What I think it probably means is this, when there's a whole bunch of fish somewhere for one of these whales,

1099
02:26:58,560 --> 02:27:04,560
it might be 200 miles away, and whales eat a lot,

1100
02:27:04,560 --> 02:27:08,560
and it's very important to find where the fish are,

1101
02:27:08,560 --> 02:27:16,560
and I believe this message, which changes a bit during the season,

1102
02:27:16,560 --> 02:27:24,560
might be telling you where the food is on the Atlantic or Pacific coastline,

1103
02:27:24,560 --> 02:27:30,560
in great detail, because if somebody finds a lot of fish somewhere,

1104
02:27:30,560 --> 02:27:34,560
you have to swim 300 miles, and if they're not there.

1105
02:27:34,560 --> 02:27:40,560
So anyway, it's interesting that John Lily got a lot of publicity,

1106
02:27:40,560 --> 02:27:51,560
but he didn't discover squat, and finally the dolphin studyers gave up because nothing happened.

1107
02:27:51,560 --> 02:27:57,560
Anybody have heard anything? I haven't paid any attention for 20 years.

1108
02:27:57,560 --> 02:28:01,560
Have you heard of anybody discovering anything about dolphins?

1109
02:28:01,560 --> 02:28:10,560
Except they're very good at solving a lot of physical problems.

1110
02:28:10,560 --> 02:28:23,560
Anyway, that's unbothered by the mystery of why was there some psychology in Aristotle's time,

1111
02:28:23,560 --> 02:28:34,560
and why didn't it get anywhere till 1950 when there was regular psychology,

1112
02:28:34,560 --> 02:28:38,560
but it was afflicted by what I call physics envy.

1113
02:28:38,560 --> 02:28:43,560
Namely, you run into people like Estes, and well, he was pretty good actually,

1114
02:28:43,560 --> 02:28:51,560
but there are a lot of psychologists who made up things like Maxwell's equations for how animals learn,

1115
02:28:51,560 --> 02:28:59,560
and there were generally three or four laws, and if there's a sequence of events,

1116
02:28:59,560 --> 02:29:07,560
then animals remember a lot about the first few and the last few in the sequence.

1117
02:29:07,560 --> 02:29:16,560
They don't remember much about the middle, and of course the reliability of their memory depends a lot on how recent it was

1118
02:29:16,560 --> 02:29:24,560
and on how powerful the reward was and blah, blah, and so they get these little sets of rules that look like Newton's laws,

1119
02:29:24,560 --> 02:29:34,560
and that was the kind of sort of psychological physics that the so-called behaviorists were mostly looking for.

1120
02:29:34,560 --> 02:29:44,560
This was not what Tinbergen and Lorenz did, because they wrote books with extensive descriptions of what the animals did

1121
02:29:44,560 --> 02:29:52,560
and made little diagrammatic guesses about the structure of the subroutines and substructures.

1122
02:29:52,560 --> 02:29:57,560
Anyway, end of history, but it's a nice question.

1123
02:29:57,560 --> 02:30:05,560
Why do some sciences grow and why was psychology just about the last one?

1124
02:30:05,560 --> 02:30:15,560
I suspect it could have been earlier, but people tried to imitate the physicists and tried to say maybe there's something like Newton's

1125
02:30:15,560 --> 02:30:26,560
or Maxwell's laws for the mind, and they found a few, but they weren't enough to explain much.

1126
02:30:26,560 --> 02:30:31,560
There are a lot of questions.

1127
02:30:31,560 --> 02:30:43,560
When Seymour Papert and I started thinking about these things, which was really around 1960,

1128
02:30:43,560 --> 02:30:55,560
I had been working on some ideas about AI in the late 50s, and my PhD thesis was a theory of neural networks,

1129
02:30:55,560 --> 02:31:04,560
which was sort of interesting, but never really went anywhere.

1130
02:31:04,560 --> 02:31:13,560
I went to a meeting in London somewhere and gave a talk about a theory of learning that was based on some neural network ideas,

1131
02:31:13,560 --> 02:31:23,560
and there was this person from South Africa named Seymour Papert who gave the same paper.

1132
02:31:23,560 --> 02:31:29,560
I hope this happens to you someday.

1133
02:31:29,560 --> 02:31:36,560
Find somebody who thinks so much like you, only different enough that it's worth it,

1134
02:31:36,560 --> 02:31:46,560
and that you only have to say about three words a day and some whole new thing starts because we really did write the same paper

1135
02:31:46,560 --> 02:31:54,560
and it had the same equation in it.

1136
02:31:54,560 --> 02:32:01,560
He had been working for Piaget, who was the first great child psychologist.

1137
02:32:01,560 --> 02:32:10,560
I should have mentioned Piaget, who probably discovered more things about psychology than any other single person in history,

1138
02:32:10,560 --> 02:32:19,560
and there are lots of people now who are saying he was wrong about 0.73,

1139
02:32:19,560 --> 02:32:25,560
because children learn that at the age of two and a half instead of two and three quarters.

1140
02:32:25,560 --> 02:32:32,560
I'm parodying the Piaget critic community, but it's pretty bad.

1141
02:32:32,560 --> 02:32:41,560
I think those poor guys are uncomfortable because Jean Piaget published 20 books full of observations about children

1142
02:32:41,560 --> 02:32:47,560
that, as far as I know, no one had made systematically before,

1143
02:32:47,560 --> 02:32:59,560
and in his later years he started courting algebraic mathematicians because he wanted more formal theories,

1144
02:32:59,560 --> 02:33:09,560
and in my view he wanted to make his theories worse, and nothing much happened,

1145
02:33:09,560 --> 02:33:23,560
but he did visit here a couple of times and it was really exciting to meet the starter of a whole new field.

1146
02:33:23,560 --> 02:33:37,560
Anyway, Papert and I discussed lots of things, and somehow or other we kept finding other more ideas about psychology,

1147
02:33:37,560 --> 02:33:46,560
and it finally gelled into the idea that, well, if you look at the brain, you know that there are several hundred different brain centers.

1148
02:33:46,560 --> 02:33:59,560
What's all that stuff for? And how could it possibly make any sense to try to explain what it does in terms of four laws like Newton?

1149
02:33:59,560 --> 02:34:08,560
Like, how does a car work? Is there a magical force inside the engine that causes the wheels to turn?

1150
02:34:08,560 --> 02:34:20,560
No. There's this funny thing in the back to cause a differential so that if the car isn't going in a straight line,

1151
02:34:20,560 --> 02:34:27,560
the two wheels going at different speeds won't rip the...

1152
02:34:27,560 --> 02:34:32,560
If the two wheels were going at the same speed, the tread would come off in five minutes.

1153
02:34:32,560 --> 02:34:37,560
You ever wonder what a differential is for?

1154
02:34:37,560 --> 02:34:43,560
So, most of the car is fixing bugs in the other parts.

1155
02:34:43,560 --> 02:34:51,560
Most of the brain is because we started out as fish, or lizards or whatever you like,

1156
02:34:51,560 --> 02:34:58,560
and making the brain bigger wouldn't help much,

1157
02:34:58,560 --> 02:35:05,560
because you'd just get a heavier lizard that had to eat more and would think more slowly.

1158
02:35:05,560 --> 02:35:15,560
So, size is bad, but on the other hand, if you need another cubic inch of brain to fix the bugs in the other part,

1159
02:35:15,560 --> 02:35:30,560
then the evolutionary advantage of being smarter had better make you able to catch a little more food per hour.

1160
02:35:30,560 --> 02:35:36,560
So, each person is an ecology of these different processes,

1161
02:35:36,560 --> 02:35:46,560
and the brain reached its present size about a million years ago, I guess.

1162
02:35:46,560 --> 02:35:50,560
What's the current guess? Anybody been tracked?

1163
02:35:50,560 --> 02:35:57,560
They keep discovering new ancestors of humans, and I don't have the patience to read about them,

1164
02:35:57,560 --> 02:36:03,560
because you know that next week somebody will say, oh, that isn't in the main line,

1165
02:36:04,560 --> 02:36:13,560
you were just unlucky to discover that skeleton.

1166
02:36:13,560 --> 02:36:27,560
So anyway, Papert and I and a lot of students gradually developed this picture that the mind is made of lots of processes,

1167
02:36:27,560 --> 02:36:34,560
or agents, or resources, or whatever you want to call them, and it's anybody's guess what they are.

1168
02:36:34,560 --> 02:36:41,560
If you look at the anatomy of the brain, you know that people label regions,

1169
02:36:41,560 --> 02:36:48,560
so it's very clear that this occipital lobe back here is largely concerned with vision,

1170
02:36:49,560 --> 02:36:54,560
and I forget where the one for hearing is.

1171
02:36:54,560 --> 02:37:00,560
If you destroy the part of the brain for hearing in some animals,

1172
02:37:00,560 --> 02:37:07,560
you get a little bit of increased function in some part of the visual system

1173
02:37:07,560 --> 02:37:13,560
that seems to enable the animal to hear a little bit and make some reactions.

1174
02:37:14,560 --> 02:37:23,560
And there's a whole lot of hype, I think you have to call it, about the flexibility of the nervous system.

1175
02:37:23,560 --> 02:37:28,560
That is, if certain brain areas get destroyed, other parts take over.

1176
02:37:28,560 --> 02:37:35,560
They almost never are as good, and mostly many functions never get taken over at all,

1177
02:37:35,560 --> 02:37:40,560
but are replaced by ones that superficially seem similar.

1178
02:37:40,560 --> 02:37:48,560
And so there's a whole lot of, I guess, wishful thinking that the brain is immensely resourceful

1179
02:37:48,560 --> 02:37:51,560
and error-correcting and repairing.

1180
02:37:51,560 --> 02:37:58,560
I think there was some idea that it was a general phenomenon,

1181
02:37:58,560 --> 02:38:02,560
but if you do some arithmetic, you get an interesting result.

1182
02:38:02,560 --> 02:38:11,560
Suppose that each function in the brain occurred in ten different places at random.

1183
02:38:11,560 --> 02:38:21,560
Then if you removed half the brain, how many functions would you lose?

1184
02:38:21,560 --> 02:38:28,560
Well, almost nowhere arithmetic tells you you would lose about one part in the thousand.

1185
02:38:28,560 --> 02:38:33,560
And so, in fact, you would never be able to detect it.

1186
02:38:33,560 --> 02:38:41,560
So this idea that the brain has enormous redundancy will now change that number to five.

1187
02:38:41,560 --> 02:38:47,560
Suppose each function is somewhat supported in five different parts of the brain.

1188
02:38:47,560 --> 02:38:53,560
Then if you take off half the brain, then what am I saying?

1189
02:38:53,560 --> 02:39:00,560
One part in 32, chance of losing some significant function.

1190
02:39:00,560 --> 02:39:07,560
So probably lots of things that we do are supported in several parts of the brain.

1191
02:39:07,560 --> 02:39:13,560
Apparently the language center is pretty unique and some others,

1192
02:39:14,560 --> 02:39:23,560
be careful about the conclusions you read from optimistic neuroscientists.

1193
02:39:31,560 --> 02:39:42,560
Anyway, Papert and I worked on this idea of how could these large numbers of different processes be organized

1194
02:39:42,560 --> 02:39:52,560
and we made various theories about it and then around, I guess, the late 1970s,

1195
02:39:52,560 --> 02:40:00,560
we stopped working together and Papert developed his revolutionary ideas about education,

1196
02:40:00,560 --> 02:40:11,560
which certainly have had a lot of influence although they didn't sweep the world in the way we had hoped.

1197
02:40:11,560 --> 02:40:19,560
And I kept working on the Society of Mind Theory and we didn't work together so much,

1198
02:40:19,560 --> 02:40:28,560
but we still did plenty of criticizing and supporting of each other.

1199
02:40:28,560 --> 02:40:36,560
Anyway, my theory ended up with this idea that it's sort of based on Freud.

1200
02:40:36,560 --> 02:40:41,560
I don't know if I kept a picture of his here.

1201
02:40:41,560 --> 02:40:49,560
Freud concluded that the mind was an interesting arena, sort of,

1202
02:40:49,560 --> 02:40:54,560
and he had the mind divided into three parts.

1203
02:40:54,560 --> 02:41:01,560
There's at one end of the mind, which we inherited from most other animals,

1204
02:41:01,560 --> 02:41:09,560
is called the id, which is a bunch of instinctive, mainly built-in behavioral mechanisms.

1205
02:41:09,560 --> 02:41:21,560
And a second part of the mind is what he called the superego, which is a collection of critics.

1206
02:41:21,560 --> 02:41:26,560
So in Freud's first image, the brain is in two parts.

1207
02:41:26,560 --> 02:41:31,560
One is a set of instinctive, built-in behaviors and the other is a set of critics,

1208
02:41:31,560 --> 02:41:40,560
which actually are associated with a culture and a tradition.

1209
02:41:40,560 --> 02:41:46,560
And you learn from other people things that are good to do and things that are bad to do.

1210
02:41:46,560 --> 02:41:52,560
And that's called the superego.

1211
02:41:52,560 --> 02:41:58,560
This is your set of values and standards and tests for suitable behavior.

1212
02:41:58,560 --> 02:42:06,560
And the middle is this strange object called the ego, which is not what people think it is.

1213
02:42:06,560 --> 02:42:16,560
At least Freud's word, the ego, is a kind of big neutral battleground where the instinctive behaviors,

1214
02:42:16,560 --> 02:42:29,560
I keep wanting to, oh, you can see that arrow if I take my finger off it.

1215
02:42:29,560 --> 02:42:36,560
And then gradually as I kept trying to figure out where, how problems are solved

1216
02:42:36,560 --> 02:42:44,560
and what kind of processes might be involved, I got this picture which has six layers.

1217
02:42:44,560 --> 02:42:53,560
And various people come around and say, I don't think you need to distinguish between layers four and five

1218
02:42:54,560 --> 02:43:00,560
or why don't you just lump all the three top layers into one.

1219
02:43:00,560 --> 02:43:15,560
And I sort of laugh quietly and say, these people are trying to find a physics like unified minimal theory of psychology.

1220
02:43:15,560 --> 02:43:20,560
And they're probably right in one sense, but if they do that they'll get stuck

1221
02:43:20,560 --> 02:43:28,560
because if you get a new idea there'll be no place to put it.

1222
02:43:28,560 --> 02:43:35,560
So if you have something that's very mysterious, don't imitate the physicists

1223
02:43:35,560 --> 02:43:41,560
because if you make a theory that's exactly right and just accounts for the data

1224
02:43:41,560 --> 02:43:46,560
and there's nothing extra and nothing loose,

1225
02:43:46,560 --> 02:43:56,560
even when you notice a new phenomenon like dark matter, then the physicists don't know what to do.

1226
02:43:56,560 --> 02:44:03,560
Should they regard dark matter as some obscure feature of space-time

1227
02:44:03,560 --> 02:44:08,560
or does it have something to do with this universe being near another one

1228
02:44:08,560 --> 02:44:14,560
that you can't otherwise communicate with and it's all very puzzling.

1229
02:44:14,560 --> 02:44:19,560
But there are lots of things that don't fit into Newton's laws these days.

1230
02:44:19,560 --> 02:44:34,560
And I'm not suggesting a six-layer theory of physics, but it might be worth a try.

1231
02:44:34,560 --> 02:44:47,560
Okay, so I made up some nice slides, but I think I'll stop.

1232
02:44:47,560 --> 02:44:54,560
So who has some questions and what would you like to see in the theory of psychology?

1233
02:44:54,560 --> 02:44:58,560
What do you want to be explained?

1234
02:44:58,560 --> 02:45:08,560
A lot of people are convinced that there are some really serious problems and mysteries

1235
02:45:08,560 --> 02:45:13,560
like what is consciousness?

1236
02:45:13,560 --> 02:45:27,560
And if you look at chapter four, my feeling is consciousness is an etymological accident

1237
02:45:27,560 --> 02:45:38,560
that people got a word which is a suitcase for all of the things they don't understand about the mind and more.

1238
02:45:38,560 --> 02:45:44,560
But once you've got a word and it goes in the culture,

1239
02:45:44,560 --> 02:45:49,560
consider the word consciousness for a minute from a legal point of view.

1240
02:45:49,560 --> 02:45:59,560
Suppose that you happen to be walking along and you're carrying something.

1241
02:45:59,560 --> 02:46:04,560
Where is that pointer?

1242
02:46:04,560 --> 02:46:09,560
And it happens to stick somebody's eye out.

1243
02:46:09,560 --> 02:46:23,560
Then it's very important when they sue you to establish whether you meant to do it or whether it was an accident.

1244
02:46:23,560 --> 02:46:29,560
Did you consciously plan to...

1245
02:46:29,560 --> 02:46:34,560
I can't think of the English word for putting somebody's eye out.

1246
02:46:34,560 --> 02:46:45,560
There's be heading and also to gouge is a good word.

1247
02:46:45,560 --> 02:47:00,560
So anyway, it's very important for social reasons to have a word for whether an action was deliberately violating the rules

1248
02:47:00,560 --> 02:47:03,560
as opposed to accidentally violating the rules.

1249
02:47:03,560 --> 02:47:10,560
Like if you tripped on the stairs and landed on somebody and broke their neck,

1250
02:47:10,560 --> 02:47:19,560
that's not a crime unless you were so clever as to make it appear that it was an accident.

1251
02:47:20,560 --> 02:47:23,560
Anyway, you see what I mean?

1252
02:47:23,560 --> 02:47:31,560
So we need a whole system of fairness and ethics and social responsibility

1253
02:47:31,560 --> 02:47:38,560
is based on the distinction between whether an action was deliberate or not.

1254
02:47:38,560 --> 02:47:45,560
And so did he do that consciously is a word for that.

1255
02:47:45,560 --> 02:47:48,560
And somehow the idea of conscious became elevated.

1256
02:47:48,560 --> 02:47:50,560
Well, that's a very superficial.

1257
02:47:50,560 --> 02:47:56,560
You can probably think of 10 other reasons why a word like that.

1258
02:47:56,560 --> 02:47:58,560
Yes.

1259
02:47:58,560 --> 02:48:04,560
Sometimes in your writing, it seems to me that there's both sides of it.

1260
02:48:04,560 --> 02:48:06,560
Some of you argue both sides of it.

1261
02:48:06,560 --> 02:48:09,560
It seems like in that kind of...

1262
02:48:09,560 --> 02:48:12,560
I can well imagine there's that kind of representation.

1263
02:48:12,560 --> 02:48:15,560
You have representation of self and representation of your mind,

1264
02:48:15,560 --> 02:48:18,560
but then you say there's no self or no consciousness.

1265
02:48:18,560 --> 02:48:24,560
Why can't you think about consciousness as just a process that is reasoning about your own mind?

1266
02:48:24,560 --> 02:48:26,560
Well, I...

1267
02:48:26,560 --> 02:48:30,560
I mean, I understand you don't want to talk about self as that's a real discussion, but...

1268
02:48:30,560 --> 02:48:36,560
No, but sometimes when you say conscious, that is, do you remember doing it?

1269
02:48:36,560 --> 02:48:38,560
Which is...

1270
02:48:38,560 --> 02:48:44,560
Yeah, but don't want to load up my process that asks me what I think about my own mind

1271
02:48:44,560 --> 02:48:47,560
and then I retrieve that and I say, yeah, I do remember it.

1272
02:48:47,560 --> 02:48:48,560
Well, you're right.

1273
02:48:48,560 --> 02:48:54,560
Actually, I went to a lot of trouble to find 25 or 30 different uses

1274
02:48:54,560 --> 02:48:59,560
for the word consciousness, and probably if I...

1275
02:48:59,560 --> 02:49:04,560
or if one of us worked harder, we could take those and condense them into five or six

1276
02:49:04,560 --> 02:49:09,560
much better ones that account for more stuff than the 30.

1277
02:49:09,560 --> 02:49:15,560
That might be just right for something.

1278
02:49:15,560 --> 02:49:18,560
Who knows?

1279
02:49:18,560 --> 02:49:22,560
Yes, well...

1280
02:49:23,560 --> 02:49:30,560
I think that's a great criticism of one reason why people don't like these theories quite so much

1281
02:49:30,560 --> 02:49:34,560
because I propose too many things.

1282
02:49:34,560 --> 02:49:41,560
I really should reprint that criticism from RESTAC or hand it out

1283
02:49:41,560 --> 02:49:45,560
because this neurologist who says,

1284
02:49:45,560 --> 02:49:54,560
why is he telling us all these things about K-lines and representations and so forth?

1285
02:49:54,560 --> 02:50:02,560
The answer is he's from a community that doesn't have enough variety yet.

1286
02:50:02,560 --> 02:50:07,560
And I'd be the first to admit that I try to go overboard

1287
02:50:07,560 --> 02:50:13,560
and think of five more things than are in the literature.

1288
02:50:16,560 --> 02:50:21,560
But that emotion thing is nice.

1289
02:50:21,560 --> 02:50:28,560
Remember that that was a serious challenge because when I made that list,

1290
02:50:28,560 --> 02:50:36,560
I do have a laser pointer somewhere in my jacket probably.

1291
02:50:37,560 --> 02:50:46,560
How many words for at least noticeably distinct ways of thinking or reasoning

1292
02:50:46,560 --> 02:50:51,560
or figuring out or solving problems can you think of?

1293
02:50:51,560 --> 02:50:54,560
Maybe there are 20 or 30.

1294
02:50:54,560 --> 02:51:00,560
I just realized this afternoon that I never looked.

1295
02:51:00,560 --> 02:51:05,560
I don't remember where I got this list.

1296
02:51:07,560 --> 02:51:12,560
Can I ask about your perception of free will?

1297
02:51:12,560 --> 02:51:18,560
I got a lot of readings that you don't have a strong sense of free will, so what is that?

1298
02:51:18,560 --> 02:51:24,560
I think it's the same as the one for consciousness, namely it's a legal concept.

1299
02:51:24,560 --> 02:51:28,560
The idea of free will is completely obscene, isn't it?

1300
02:51:28,560 --> 02:51:34,560
What could it possibly mean if you did something for no reason?

1301
02:51:35,560 --> 02:51:40,560
So it's a thoroughly empty idea, isn't it?

1302
02:51:40,560 --> 02:51:42,560
Or what do you mean by it?

1303
02:51:42,560 --> 02:51:50,560
Do you mean there's nobody ordering you around so you're free to do whatever you want?

1304
02:51:50,560 --> 02:51:51,560
But of course you're not.

1305
02:51:51,560 --> 02:51:56,560
You can only do what your computer computes you to do.

1306
02:51:57,560 --> 02:52:06,560
In the same way that you show the fish diagram, the fish's actions are products of the environment

1307
02:52:06,560 --> 02:52:10,560
and its current state, and it's essentially a turning machine.

1308
02:52:10,560 --> 02:52:12,560
Well, it's some kind of machine, yes, sure.

1309
02:52:12,560 --> 02:52:17,560
And so would you argue that we are also turning machines that are just turning out in the world?

1310
02:52:17,560 --> 02:52:19,560
Sure.

1311
02:52:19,560 --> 02:52:24,560
I've never heard of any even interesting alternative.

1312
02:52:24,560 --> 02:52:30,560
In other words, people who insist on free will appear to me to be like people who believe

1313
02:52:30,560 --> 02:52:34,560
that there must be a God who created the world.

1314
02:52:34,560 --> 02:52:35,560
What's the next step?

1315
02:52:35,560 --> 02:52:37,560
Who created the God?

1316
02:52:37,560 --> 02:52:39,560
They don't take that step.

1317
02:52:39,560 --> 02:52:45,560
So if your will is free, okay, then who's controlling it?

1318
02:52:45,560 --> 02:52:47,560
There's nothing there.

1319
02:52:47,560 --> 02:52:56,560
But legally it's great, because if somebody stole some money of their own free will.

1320
02:52:56,560 --> 02:53:07,560
But suppose you were a peculiar kind of epileptic, and every now and then when you go by,

1321
02:53:07,560 --> 02:53:11,560
your hand goes out and steals things.

1322
02:53:11,560 --> 02:53:15,560
Then they, what do they do?

1323
02:53:15,560 --> 02:53:19,560
They put you on parole?

1324
02:53:19,560 --> 02:53:21,560
This is very strange.

1325
02:53:21,560 --> 02:53:27,560
But if you look at religions, you see that people make money on them.

1326
02:53:27,560 --> 02:53:37,560
13% of the world's product goes to people who make their living on concepts like free will and consciousness.

1327
02:53:37,560 --> 02:53:39,560
So it's a big money thing.

1328
02:53:39,560 --> 02:53:42,560
It's not just an accident.

1329
02:53:42,560 --> 02:53:45,560
It's an industry.

1330
02:53:45,560 --> 02:53:49,560
So both of those are concepts of society?

1331
02:53:49,560 --> 02:53:50,560
They're parasitic.

1332
02:53:50,560 --> 02:53:54,560
Imagine a society without the concept of consciousness of free will.

1333
02:53:54,560 --> 02:53:56,560
But those are requirements for being free will.

1334
02:53:56,560 --> 02:53:57,560
I don't think you could.

1335
02:53:57,560 --> 02:54:04,560
You'd have to make up something to keep people in check and under control and to train them.

1336
02:54:04,560 --> 02:54:12,560
It's like the rat being, the rat needs somebody to press the reward or punish button.

1337
02:54:12,560 --> 02:54:21,560
And we have it built into our, a culture works because you build into people's head the machinery for suppressing doubt.

1338
02:54:21,560 --> 02:54:26,560
And it's very clever.

1339
02:54:26,560 --> 02:54:33,560
But you should think of it as an industry rather than an explicable phenomenon.

1340
02:54:33,560 --> 02:54:37,560
How much money goes into, yes?

1341
02:54:37,560 --> 02:54:44,560
How many ways of thinking can you think of right now?

1342
02:54:44,560 --> 02:54:51,560
That's my challenge, in fact.

1343
02:54:51,560 --> 02:54:59,560
There's probably a big list in some chapter or other, but there's nothing like this.

1344
02:54:59,560 --> 02:55:10,560
What's the trick? Three, if I go like that.

1345
02:55:10,560 --> 02:55:16,560
Actually, Dragon has a thing so you can tell it make things bigger.

1346
02:55:16,560 --> 02:55:22,560
How many of you use the new Dragon program speech thing?

1347
02:55:22,560 --> 02:55:26,560
I can't believe how good it is.

1348
02:55:26,560 --> 02:55:31,560
I was talking to Henry Lieberman about it earlier.

1349
02:55:31,560 --> 02:55:33,560
Yes?

1350
02:55:33,560 --> 02:55:41,560
So I'm wondering, personally, you would say that the side of mind here is both humans and animals.

1351
02:55:41,560 --> 02:55:46,560
Is it just that we have higher levels of organization than them?

1352
02:55:46,560 --> 02:55:49,560
And so where would you draw that line?

1353
02:55:49,560 --> 02:55:55,560
Like, do animals not have a notion of the cell that we describe in the book?

1354
02:55:55,560 --> 02:56:06,560
That's a great question and it'd be interesting to think about ways to investigate it.

1355
02:56:06,560 --> 02:56:14,560
People are, researchers are often, in fact, raising that question of,

1356
02:56:14,560 --> 02:56:18,560
do animals have a representation of themselves?

1357
02:56:18,560 --> 02:56:24,560
And there's a famous experiment, but I can't remember what its current status is,

1358
02:56:24,560 --> 02:56:30,560
where you put a red dot on a chimpanzee's head,

1359
02:56:30,560 --> 02:56:39,560
and when the chimp passes a mirror and sees that, the chimp might go like that.

1360
02:56:39,560 --> 02:56:55,560
Whereas, I don't think a dog, when it passes a mirror, would rub its forehead to see if it has a red spot.

1361
02:56:55,560 --> 02:57:04,560
I had a cat who walked past mirrors, because we have some wool full-sized mirrors around the house.

1362
02:57:04,560 --> 02:57:11,560
And the cat walks by and there's this other cat in the mirror, and she pays no attention to it, whatever.

1363
02:57:11,560 --> 02:57:18,560
So, of course, I don't know what happened the first three times she walked by that mirror.

1364
02:57:18,560 --> 02:57:23,560
Because if you see another cat going by, you'd think it would...

1365
02:57:23,560 --> 02:57:33,560
Anyway, it's a good question and people ask that and there's some evidence that elephants have a model of themselves.

1366
02:57:34,560 --> 02:57:42,560
And maybe dolphins, and I don't know where...

1367
02:57:42,560 --> 02:57:51,560
Have any of you heard any stories of other animals that can recognize, for example, when they've been painted?

1368
02:57:51,560 --> 02:57:53,560
Which?

1369
02:57:53,560 --> 02:57:54,560
Is it elephants?

1370
02:57:54,560 --> 02:57:56,560
Yes, I think elephants.

1371
02:57:56,560 --> 02:58:08,560
There's a famous child psychology experiment where, if you're less than a couple months old, you actually fail this test.

1372
02:58:08,560 --> 02:58:15,560
So, it's actually something that comes as a sign of your child progressing.

1373
02:58:15,560 --> 02:58:20,560
So, it might not be intrinsic to humanity, but it might be so.

1374
02:58:20,560 --> 02:58:23,560
So, I'm sure that the chimp can see how it can do that.

1375
02:58:24,560 --> 02:58:43,560
This is off the topic, but I once had a great email correspondence with some woman who was getting a PhD in France about how babies recognize their mothers.

1376
02:58:44,560 --> 02:58:47,560
And she concluded with...

1377
02:58:47,560 --> 02:58:56,560
You did experiments after having other people walk into the room with a mask of the mother or a different hairdo and so forth.

1378
02:58:56,560 --> 02:59:07,560
And for the first two months or three months, I think, it turned out that the baby recognizes the mother by the hairdo, which had not been known.

1379
02:59:07,560 --> 02:59:16,560
And then, I think, after three months, it's recognizing the mother by a face.

1380
02:59:16,560 --> 02:59:27,560
And at that point, she's doing experiments where you get another woman wearing a copy of the mother's face.

1381
02:59:27,560 --> 02:59:33,560
And so, now there's two mothers and the baby is absolutely delighted.

1382
02:59:34,560 --> 02:59:46,560
And then, as I can't remember, then I think at four or five months, when two copies of the mother comes in, the baby gets really panicked.

1383
02:59:46,560 --> 02:59:52,560
So, I lost track of her.

1384
02:59:52,560 --> 02:59:56,560
If you have a baby, let me know.

1385
03:00:01,560 --> 03:00:08,560
She got her PhD for this, and I haven't heard anything since. Yes?

1386
03:00:08,560 --> 03:00:16,560
Here's sort of a formulated thought that I just thought of regarding ways of thinking and ways of feeling.

1387
03:00:16,560 --> 03:00:25,560
So, it just occurred to me that it seems like, if you go back to the list of feelings, it seems like when we talk about feeling, we're talking about a state that the brain is in.

1388
03:00:25,560 --> 03:00:34,560
So, it might be a complicated state that's like some combination of a lot of different parameters, but it's a state that you can stay in for like an arbitrary amount of time.

1389
03:00:34,560 --> 03:00:45,560
But I think thinking is something that's more sequential, as in like, when you're thinking, you're necessarily changing the state of your brain all the time because you're moving bits around.

1390
03:00:46,560 --> 03:00:50,560
No, I think that's right.

1391
03:00:50,560 --> 03:00:54,560
I think when we talk about intelligent behavior, you're absolutely right.

1392
03:00:54,560 --> 03:01:02,560
What you've got is a process that's criticizing itself and seeing when you got stuck in finding things to do.

1393
03:01:03,560 --> 03:01:17,560
And I suppose in each emotional state, you're certainly also thinking, so that's going on, but maybe it's more restricted.

1394
03:01:17,560 --> 03:01:37,560
If you're confronting somebody and there's a sort of conflict, then almost all your thoughts are constrained to that subject and it's not as resourceful, but I'm just improvising.

1395
03:01:48,560 --> 03:02:14,560
Okay, I think what I'm talking about in this context is sort of extreme forms where the person changes into another machine and it's like an angry person won't listen to reason.

1396
03:02:15,560 --> 03:02:21,560
Or it's very hard to deflect them, so it's this kind of rigid thing.

1397
03:02:21,560 --> 03:02:30,560
But humans are generally, are rarely in such extreme states where nothing gets through.

1398
03:02:31,560 --> 03:02:49,560
The whole point of that was that, and I just realized that maybe it was just too lazy, that we have this huge vocabulary of nuances of emotional activity.

1399
03:02:49,560 --> 03:03:00,560
And people think these are, also people think that these are hard to explain and mysterious and non-physical and blah, blah, blah.

1400
03:03:00,560 --> 03:03:15,560
But why do we wait till next week and see if somebody comes up with, or see if we can come up with a set of 30 or 40 words about intellectual states, curiosity.

1401
03:03:16,560 --> 03:03:23,560
I just don't know how many there are and I haven't thought of any in the last few minutes.

1402
03:03:23,560 --> 03:03:26,560
Yes, has anybody thought of a couple of...

1403
03:03:26,560 --> 03:03:31,560
What's the word?

1404
03:03:31,560 --> 03:03:40,560
Flow, like just in the high, when you're really engaged in some activity that you're doing and you're really in the zone.

1405
03:03:41,560 --> 03:03:48,560
Yes, there's this, there's a state of keeping other things out so you can focus.

1406
03:03:48,560 --> 03:03:51,560
Not being interuptable, yes.

1407
03:03:51,560 --> 03:03:58,560
So in this side of mind, you talked about agents and how they divide between themselves.

1408
03:03:58,560 --> 03:04:08,560
But I don't see anywhere about how evolution modified a lot agents.

1409
03:04:08,560 --> 03:04:13,560
Like I believe that evolution modified the way we think right now.

1410
03:04:13,560 --> 03:04:18,560
I don't know if you saw, there's a paper like wrote like two years ago.

1411
03:04:18,560 --> 03:04:21,560
It's called The Region of Behavior.

1412
03:04:21,560 --> 03:04:26,560
And this guy tried to explain like how we make some decisions.

1413
03:04:26,560 --> 03:04:32,560
Evolutionary, like in a point of view of like our speech.

1414
03:04:33,560 --> 03:04:41,560
We are maximizing the probability of reproducing ourselves.

1415
03:04:41,560 --> 03:04:47,560
But individually we are not kind of increasing these efficiencies.

1416
03:04:47,560 --> 03:04:54,560
And like I think somehow like these agents would be like the decisions of agents or resources

1417
03:04:54,560 --> 03:05:04,560
would be like very determined by evolution since we have like a very long time to like of evolution of the human being.

1418
03:05:04,560 --> 03:05:08,560
And somehow we have like hard wire to make some decisions.

1419
03:05:08,560 --> 03:05:13,560
So for example, like he gives the example of like a guy.

1420
03:05:13,560 --> 03:05:16,560
Well, for lizards that's certainly true.

1421
03:05:16,560 --> 03:05:21,560
But why do humans keep changing their environment?

1422
03:05:21,560 --> 03:05:27,560
So like for example, yeah, so he gives this example of like tossing a point.

1423
03:05:27,560 --> 03:05:31,560
The guy says that like this coin is unfair.

1424
03:05:31,560 --> 03:05:41,560
And like there is seven, he doesn't say the probabilities, but there is 75% of getting heads and 25% of getting tails.

1425
03:05:41,560 --> 03:05:52,560
And like we like the subjects, they choose run only 25% of the time the tails.

1426
03:05:52,560 --> 03:06:00,560
Even though they like they can take account of the number of the times that you put heads.

1427
03:06:00,560 --> 03:06:10,560
And even though if you choose always hands, you would get more money or whatever you would make it the right decision.

1428
03:06:11,560 --> 03:06:13,560
That's called probability matching.

1429
03:06:13,560 --> 03:06:16,560
And it's not a good strategy.

1430
03:06:16,560 --> 03:06:18,560
Yeah, but humans do that.

1431
03:06:18,560 --> 03:06:25,560
No, well, they do it if the psychologist rigs the experiment very carefully.

1432
03:06:25,560 --> 03:06:29,560
It turns out that the best things, what do you think is the optimal strategy?

1433
03:06:29,560 --> 03:06:30,560
Always.

1434
03:06:30,560 --> 03:06:39,560
No, the optimal strategy turns out it's the square roots of the probabilities normalized to add up to one.

1435
03:06:39,560 --> 03:06:43,560
And I'll, I'll give you a proof next time.

1436
03:06:43,560 --> 03:06:49,560
This theorem is due to Ray Solomon off who invented inductive probability theory.

1437
03:06:49,560 --> 03:06:59,560
So evolution, if evolution did probability matching, then it would be wrong.

1438
03:06:59,560 --> 03:07:06,560
And I bet you'll find out that those experiments are wrong.

1439
03:07:06,560 --> 03:07:16,560
You have to see how did he rig the experiment so that people, if it's probability 25%, they guess that 25%.

1440
03:07:16,560 --> 03:07:22,560
I don't know.

1441
03:07:22,560 --> 03:07:26,560
There was a theory about why you would expect it.

1442
03:07:26,560 --> 03:07:27,560
It's a good question.

1443
03:07:27,560 --> 03:07:30,560
I don't think people use probabilities though.

1444
03:07:30,560 --> 03:07:45,560
So even if an experiment shows some, I would look for a flaw in the design of the experiment.

1445
03:07:45,560 --> 03:07:46,560
Yes.

1446
03:07:47,560 --> 03:07:50,560
You talked about a lot of emotions today, I'm sure.

1447
03:07:50,560 --> 03:08:05,560
And my understanding is that for someone who has a specific personality, they might have a predisposition to feel certain emotions, like anger, depression, or whatnot.

1448
03:08:05,560 --> 03:08:20,560
My question is that if you had any kind of insight or theories on to what extent our personality is affected by events or influences that happened to us over the course of a lifetime.

1449
03:08:20,560 --> 03:08:28,560
And to what extent is it impacted by sort of, you know, chemical violence when you wake up or carbohydrate?

1450
03:08:28,560 --> 03:08:33,560
Well you're asking what things do, what do people learn?

1451
03:08:34,560 --> 03:08:37,560
We don't care if it's chemical or...

1452
03:08:37,560 --> 03:08:42,560
See if it's chemical, it's still physical.

1453
03:08:42,560 --> 03:08:49,560
I mean, I reckon we'll go to that sort of treatment for your depression.

1454
03:08:49,560 --> 03:09:01,560
And the argument is that a lot of reasons for your depression is because of some sort of chemical or biological way of operating is constructed.

1455
03:09:01,560 --> 03:09:04,560
Well there's lots of complicated things about the brain.

1456
03:09:04,560 --> 03:09:09,560
One feature of the brain that I don't know if everybody...

1457
03:09:09,560 --> 03:09:14,560
You know that there are inhibitory and excitatory synapses.

1458
03:09:14,560 --> 03:09:30,560
When one neuron connects to another, the impulse that goes along the axon to the target neuron may reduce the probability or the strength of its firing or increase it.

1459
03:09:30,560 --> 03:09:35,560
So that's called inhibiting or...

1460
03:09:35,560 --> 03:09:38,560
There's no...

1461
03:09:38,560 --> 03:09:42,560
Or exciting, that's not quite the right word is it?

1462
03:09:42,560 --> 03:09:47,560
Now generally in the nervous system has a rule but not always.

1463
03:09:47,560 --> 03:09:56,560
If you follow a chain of activity, it goes inhibiting, exciting, inhibiting, exciting.

1464
03:09:56,560 --> 03:10:06,560
If you had too many excitatory things and there was a loop, then it would explode and it would wear itself out and jig time.

1465
03:10:06,560 --> 03:10:11,560
So there is this general feature of the anatomy that you alternate.

1466
03:10:11,560 --> 03:10:25,560
So when somebody talks about a drug having an inhibitory effect, that's sort of weird because it's inhibiting half the neurons and therefore lowering the thresholds.

1467
03:10:25,560 --> 03:10:28,560
Of the ones they're connected to and so on.

1468
03:10:28,560 --> 03:10:45,560
So I think the best thing is until you have a diagram of the functional relations between different brain centers, it might be best not to try to make generalizations about how the chemistry works.

1469
03:10:46,560 --> 03:11:03,560
It's easy but people think of adrenaline as a stimulant but in the nervous epinephrine but in the nervous system it's locally it may be inhibiting things that are inhibiting something else.

1470
03:11:03,560 --> 03:11:05,560
And so it appears to be exciting.

1471
03:11:05,560 --> 03:11:07,560
Yes.

1472
03:11:07,560 --> 03:11:26,560
I have a problem understanding the difference between thoughts and emotions and knowing something might be as simple but since the only thing that I can separate in my mind is that thoughts, so let's call it a time constant, I can change it kind of rapidly.

1473
03:11:26,560 --> 03:11:32,560
Emotions, time constant is long and I can control it again much less.

1474
03:11:32,560 --> 03:11:45,560
But since there is no, at least in this class, there is no preview, how can I make a decision on where the dividing line between these two entities is?

1475
03:11:45,560 --> 03:11:49,560
Oh, I think it's a waste of time.

1476
03:11:49,560 --> 03:12:02,560
As far as I can see, emotional mechanisms are generally lower level simpler ones than the ones that involve several layers of the, more layers of the brain.

1477
03:12:02,560 --> 03:12:04,560
So it's just a relative thing.

1478
03:12:04,560 --> 03:12:07,560
It's not that some states are emotional.

1479
03:12:07,560 --> 03:12:12,560
You're always having some high level thoughts and low level thoughts.

1480
03:12:12,560 --> 03:12:20,560
And the distinction, I just don't know why the distinction has occupied so much tension.

1481
03:12:20,560 --> 03:12:30,560
I think it's because, and that goes back to having more words for, or asking how many words do we have for ways to think.

1482
03:12:31,560 --> 03:12:43,560
It seems to me that in popular culture, there are very few words for ways to think and lots of words for emotions and so they're very prominent.

1483
03:12:43,560 --> 03:12:51,560
Maybe you have to be smarter to distinguish between ways to think and people generally are dumb.

1484
03:12:51,560 --> 03:13:02,560
Not because they're inherently dumb, but they come from cultures which bully you if you, you know, what happens if you're in third grade and you're smart.

1485
03:13:02,560 --> 03:13:11,560
You get it beaten out of you and you learn not to show it.

1486
03:13:11,560 --> 03:13:21,560
Kind of looked like that question of why science happened earlier and why we have more ways to describe different ways to think.

1487
03:13:21,560 --> 03:13:29,560
And that sort of puzzled me, but can we just not reflect it as much on different thinking states or different approaches?

1488
03:13:29,560 --> 03:13:32,560
I wonder if the Greeks had more, but we...

1489
03:13:32,560 --> 03:13:42,560
I think they did. I think they had also more concept of ideas and different states and their approaches.

1490
03:13:45,560 --> 03:13:50,560
Who has a theory of that? What's your theory of the Middle Ages?

1491
03:13:53,560 --> 03:13:57,560
How could things get dark for so, so dark for so long?

1492
03:13:58,560 --> 03:14:02,560
Well, I do have a theory.

1493
03:14:02,560 --> 03:14:05,560
And are we about to have one?

1494
03:14:05,560 --> 03:14:17,560
I think it has this much to do with the channels in which one can communicate ideas to other people, whether they exist or not, whether the arteries are over their clothes.

1495
03:14:17,560 --> 03:14:23,560
The Middle Ages were characterized by scientific discoveries being kept as family secrets.

1496
03:14:24,560 --> 03:14:31,560
Ah, Cardan knew how to take cube roots and he wouldn't tell anyone.

1497
03:14:31,560 --> 03:14:39,560
Well, the classic student example is baby talk, which for 300 years made a single Italian family very rich.

1498
03:14:39,560 --> 03:14:46,560
You know, using tunnels to extract the baby and crop earth increased success rate in difficult births by about 10% they say.

1499
03:14:46,560 --> 03:14:47,560
Wow.

1500
03:14:47,560 --> 03:14:52,560
And that was enough to build a family fortune until some servant finally stole the gene.

1501
03:14:58,560 --> 03:15:01,560
So, who has a theory of the Middle Ages?

1502
03:15:01,560 --> 03:15:04,560
Is there a standard theory? Yes.

1503
03:15:04,560 --> 03:15:10,560
Well, the concept of the Middle Ages as the dark ages is something that emerged mostly in the Renaissance,

1504
03:15:10,560 --> 03:15:21,560
when people in the 14th, 15th, 16th century tried to present themselves as going back to the classical age of scholarship of ancient Greece and Rome,

1505
03:15:21,560 --> 03:15:25,560
and as being better than their predecessor for the last few years.

1506
03:15:25,560 --> 03:15:31,560
This mostly happened because of the discovery of manuscripts that were translated from the ancient Greek,

1507
03:15:31,560 --> 03:15:39,560
and in certain cases Latin by muslims who at the time were sort of receding from Europe.

1508
03:15:40,560 --> 03:15:45,560
So, the entire concept of the Middle Ages might be a fabrication of the Renaissance.

1509
03:15:45,560 --> 03:15:48,560
There were some significant discoveries at the time.

1510
03:15:48,560 --> 03:15:49,560
That's a nice idea.

1511
03:15:49,560 --> 03:15:52,560
In other words, when was St. Patrick?

1512
03:15:52,560 --> 03:15:54,560
St. Patrick.

1513
03:15:54,560 --> 03:16:04,560
I'm told that he popularized a lot of technical manuscripts, brought them back into Europe.

1514
03:16:04,560 --> 03:16:09,560
He has two achievements.

1515
03:16:09,560 --> 03:16:17,560
One was bringing scientific culture back, and the other was getting snakes out of England or something.

1516
03:16:17,560 --> 03:16:19,560
Ireland.

1517
03:16:19,560 --> 03:16:22,560
I don't know which he was sainted for.

1518
03:16:22,560 --> 03:16:25,560
Don't you have to do three miracles, or is it?

1519
03:16:25,560 --> 03:16:29,560
What's, what's, yeah?

1520
03:16:29,560 --> 03:16:34,560
Yeah, my theory is that the Middle Ages ended around 2100.

1521
03:16:34,560 --> 03:16:40,560
Because they'll say, after the Middle Ages ended, they'll say, you know, those guys back in the 21st century,

1522
03:16:40,560 --> 03:16:43,560
they had no idea how thinking worked.

1523
03:16:43,560 --> 03:16:47,560
They couldn't even think of a few ways to think.

1524
03:16:47,560 --> 03:16:50,560
They had poverty, they had wars.

1525
03:16:50,560 --> 03:16:53,560
You know, those guys were barely out of their winecloths.

1526
03:16:53,560 --> 03:16:56,560
Right.

1527
03:16:56,560 --> 03:16:58,560
I just read a history of AI.

1528
03:16:58,560 --> 03:17:00,560
I forget who wrote it.

1529
03:17:00,560 --> 03:17:07,560
But it had this section saying, it mentioned the Newell Simon.

1530
03:17:07,560 --> 03:17:12,560
There was a thing called general problem solver, which I mentioned a couple of times in the book.

1531
03:17:12,560 --> 03:17:19,560
And it's the idea that the way to solve a problem is to find, it's a symbolic servo.

1532
03:17:19,560 --> 03:17:23,560
Find the difference between what you have and what you want.

1533
03:17:23,560 --> 03:17:27,560
And look in your memory for something that can reduce that difference.

1534
03:17:27,560 --> 03:17:28,560
Keep doing that.

1535
03:17:28,560 --> 03:17:36,560
And of course, it's, it's important to pay attention to the more important differences first and so forth.

1536
03:17:36,560 --> 03:17:39,560
And I'll send you this article.

1537
03:17:39,560 --> 03:17:46,560
This article is saying that they made a terrible mistake and this was a trivial theory.

1538
03:17:46,560 --> 03:17:48,560
And that's why nobody uses it anymore.

1539
03:17:48,560 --> 03:17:55,560
And it was interesting how many AI people fell for that idea in the 1960s.

1540
03:17:55,560 --> 03:18:08,560
My complaint has been that if you look in a modern textbook on, you must have some in your first volume, Pat.

1541
03:18:08,560 --> 03:18:15,560
Didn't you have some GPS things?

1542
03:18:15,560 --> 03:18:20,560
If you want to keep up with AI, you should read Patrick's textbook, even though he's,

1543
03:18:20,560 --> 03:18:28,560
people are starting to use this new one, which doesn't have any AI in it.

1544
03:18:28,560 --> 03:18:30,560
By, who's it by?

1545
03:18:30,560 --> 03:18:32,560
Russell and Norvig.

1546
03:18:32,560 --> 03:18:33,560
Russell and Norvig.

1547
03:18:33,560 --> 03:18:41,560
It's probably pretty good technically, but I leafed through it and it didn't have any, never mind.

1548
03:18:41,560 --> 03:18:54,560
It's probably better than I think because I'm jealous.

1549
03:18:54,560 --> 03:18:57,560
Yes.

1550
03:18:57,560 --> 03:18:59,560
It's kind of a different topic.

1551
03:18:59,560 --> 03:19:05,560
In Society of Learning, you're talking about the amnesia of infancy when you forget what you learned

1552
03:19:05,560 --> 03:19:08,560
and things that were once difficult to become common sense.

1553
03:19:08,560 --> 03:19:10,560
You can't even remember how it wasn't like that.

1554
03:19:10,560 --> 03:19:14,560
So it's just kind of wondering about the reverse of that process when you try and say,

1555
03:19:14,560 --> 03:19:18,560
do something to somebody that you turn on so that people can get your quick awareness on it

1556
03:19:18,560 --> 03:19:23,560
and bring back up the different levels.

1557
03:19:23,560 --> 03:19:36,560
I was wondering about, is that itself another way of relearning the things that you learned?

1558
03:19:36,560 --> 03:19:41,560
That's sure an interesting question.

1559
03:19:41,560 --> 03:19:52,560
When I first learned about programming, I had the idea that maybe babies think in machine language

1560
03:19:52,560 --> 03:19:59,560
and then after a while they start to think in FORTRAN.

1561
03:19:59,560 --> 03:20:05,560
And then finally when they're a little older, they think in ALGO or something.

1562
03:20:05,560 --> 03:20:14,560
But when they switch from machine language to FORTRAN, then they can't remember their earlier thoughts.

1563
03:20:14,560 --> 03:20:30,560
And there's almost no evidence of people finding genuine recollections from two-year-olds at later ages.

1564
03:20:30,560 --> 03:20:33,560
Now almost everybody thinks they remember something,

1565
03:20:33,560 --> 03:20:39,560
but there's the problem that you might have rehearsed it and translated it into the FORTRAN

1566
03:20:39,560 --> 03:20:47,560
and the ALGO and the LISP and the logo, whatever it is.

1567
03:20:47,560 --> 03:20:57,560
I had one of my greatest influences was a great mathematician named Andrew Gleason at Harvard,

1568
03:20:57,560 --> 03:21:04,560
who I met practically the first day I got to Harvard.

1569
03:21:04,560 --> 03:21:12,560
And he would always talk about things I didn't understand and I would go home and look them up and try to.

1570
03:21:12,560 --> 03:21:18,560
Anyway, one day we were talking about number forms.

1571
03:21:18,560 --> 03:21:27,560
And number forms are a psychological phenomenon which about 30% of people have.

1572
03:21:27,560 --> 03:21:32,560
And it was first described by Francis Galton.

1573
03:21:32,560 --> 03:21:46,560
And the phenomenon is if I ask you, close your eyes and tell me where is the number three?

1574
03:21:46,560 --> 03:21:52,560
How many of you have a place for the number three?

1575
03:21:52,560 --> 03:21:54,560
Well, that's a few.

1576
03:21:54,560 --> 03:22:04,560
So typically, if you imagine the visual field, that's a windshield, I guess.

1577
03:22:04,560 --> 03:22:23,560
So there are these numbers and they're nowhere in particular except that it's usually like that for an older child.

1578
03:22:23,560 --> 03:22:31,560
So here are these numbers and what's more in some people they're colored.

1579
03:22:31,560 --> 03:22:40,560
So I was talking to Andrew Gleason, I had read this Galton paper which was 1890 or 1885 or something.

1580
03:22:40,560 --> 03:22:44,560
And so I was asking people if they had number forms.

1581
03:22:44,560 --> 03:22:47,560
And he said, oh yes, he has one.

1582
03:22:47,560 --> 03:22:52,560
And he sketched it for me.

1583
03:22:52,560 --> 03:22:56,560
And he said, and they're colored too.

1584
03:22:56,560 --> 03:23:05,560
Oh, and his went way up and the prime numbers were bright.

1585
03:23:05,560 --> 03:23:08,560
What am I doing?

1586
03:23:08,560 --> 03:23:12,560
Maybe the composite numbers were something was bright.

1587
03:23:12,560 --> 03:23:16,560
And they were colored.

1588
03:23:16,560 --> 03:23:26,560
So I wrote this down and I, over the next couple of years, I look in antique stores for old children's blocks.

1589
03:23:26,560 --> 03:23:32,560
And I found a set of blocks that matched that.

1590
03:23:32,560 --> 03:23:39,560
And Andrew Gleason said that he knows when he acquired this thing.

1591
03:23:39,560 --> 03:23:51,560
And it was about four years old and he had a window which in this house and there was a hill.

1592
03:23:51,560 --> 03:23:58,560
And he could just see over the sill and he imagined these numbers on the side of that hill.

1593
03:23:58,560 --> 03:23:59,560
Blah, blah, blah.

1594
03:23:59,560 --> 03:24:08,560
Anyway, people who don't have a number form don't know what I'm talking about.

1595
03:24:08,560 --> 03:24:15,560
And I don't know if the 30% is still true, but it's an interesting phenomenon.

1596
03:24:15,560 --> 03:24:28,560
And in most cases of early childhood, well, that's, you can't find out because children do remember details of a house they lived in,

1597
03:24:28,560 --> 03:24:32,560
but you don't know if they've copied it.

1598
03:24:32,560 --> 03:24:37,560
So what was the original question?

1599
03:24:37,560 --> 03:24:41,560
How much can you remember from infancy?

1600
03:24:41,560 --> 03:24:46,560
Elran Hubbard thought you could go back to before you were born.

1601
03:24:46,560 --> 03:24:58,560
And you could remember people talking about you when you're still in the womb.

1602
03:24:58,560 --> 03:25:01,560
So anyway, John Campbell said you should look into this.

1603
03:25:01,560 --> 03:25:05,560
And a few of us made an expedition.

1604
03:25:05,560 --> 03:25:13,560
We went down to Elizabeth, New Jersey to visit the just starting up Dianetics Center.

1605
03:25:13,560 --> 03:25:22,560
And I met this Elran Hubbard who had green eyes and was quite hypnotic looking.

1606
03:25:23,560 --> 03:25:31,560
And the end of the story is he had been writing about how if you took this treatment of Dianetics,

1607
03:25:31,560 --> 03:25:38,560
then you could memorize an entire newspaper in five minutes and do all sorts of miraculous things like that.

1608
03:25:38,560 --> 03:25:43,560
Once your mind has been cleared of aberrations and obstacles.

1609
03:25:43,560 --> 03:25:48,560
And I became a big industry and turned into later Scientology.

1610
03:25:48,560 --> 03:25:51,560
I'm sure you've all heard about that.

1611
03:25:51,560 --> 03:25:58,560
So we asked Hubbard to look at a newspaper and tell us what was in it.

1612
03:25:58,560 --> 03:26:11,560
And he explained he was so busy training the other people to be cleared that he hadn't had time to go through the procedure himself.

1613
03:26:11,560 --> 03:26:17,560
And I never saw him again.

1614
03:26:17,560 --> 03:26:19,560
Yes?

1615
03:26:19,560 --> 03:26:29,560
What are your thoughts on memes and the fact that we're just, but because our thoughts are actually all about the good.

1616
03:26:29,560 --> 03:26:31,560
Of memes?

1617
03:26:31,560 --> 03:26:38,560
You mean Dawkins?

1618
03:26:38,560 --> 03:26:40,560
I didn't quite get the whole question.

1619
03:26:40,560 --> 03:26:44,560
The idea that...

1620
03:26:44,560 --> 03:26:49,560
So for example the way we talk and the way we all talk,

1621
03:26:49,560 --> 03:26:55,560
how we very much mix the way our parents talk to the people around us.

1622
03:26:55,560 --> 03:26:59,560
And possibly the way we think as well.

1623
03:26:59,560 --> 03:27:03,560
So how does that relate to how our mind develops?

1624
03:27:03,560 --> 03:27:08,560
Are we actually creative original characters?

1625
03:27:08,560 --> 03:27:18,560
Well of course it's both because you learn things from your culture and then you might just mainly repeat things

1626
03:27:18,560 --> 03:27:23,560
or you might get the knack of making new ideas.

1627
03:27:23,560 --> 03:27:30,560
I'm trying to remember what Dawkins main ideas are.

1628
03:27:30,560 --> 03:27:37,560
He invented the word meme to say that

1629
03:27:37,560 --> 03:27:46,560
ideas that people have might be considered to be somewhat similar to the genes in our heredity

1630
03:27:46,560 --> 03:27:57,560
and that societies are systems in which these memes which are conceptual units of meaning or knowledge

1631
03:27:57,560 --> 03:28:04,560
propagate around and self-reproduce and mutate and spread.

1632
03:28:04,560 --> 03:28:16,560
And I don't know what to say about it except that it's obviously true that every now and then someone gets a new idea

1633
03:28:16,560 --> 03:28:22,560
and tells people and for one reason or another they either forget it or tell someone else

1634
03:28:22,560 --> 03:28:32,560
and after a while it spreads and some of them fill up the whole culture and some just die out.

1635
03:28:32,560 --> 03:28:36,560
And whatever else Dawkins says, he's a very smart guy,

1636
03:28:36,560 --> 03:28:45,560
but almost everything then in my mind is that he's explaining that religions are mostly made of these memes

1637
03:28:45,560 --> 03:28:55,560
and they're very bad and cost the world a great deal in progress and productivity.

1638
03:28:55,560 --> 03:29:05,560
In other words, he's a militant atheist and there are about five best sellers in that business today.

1639
03:29:05,560 --> 03:29:14,560
But I don't know what else to say about memes. It's an obviously generally correct idea.

1640
03:29:14,560 --> 03:29:24,560
But the great thing about genes is we know the four amino acids or four nucleic acids they're made of

1641
03:29:24,560 --> 03:29:28,560
and how they're rope together and all that.

1642
03:29:28,560 --> 03:29:37,560
And I don't think Dawkins' theory develops anywhere nearly as elegantly as modern genetics.

1643
03:29:37,560 --> 03:29:49,560
So it would be nice if it could, but a really good theory of good ideas would be nice to have.

1644
03:29:50,560 --> 03:29:55,560
What would it look like?

1645
03:29:55,560 --> 03:29:58,560
Someday we'll have an AI that just punches them out.

1646
03:29:58,560 --> 03:30:02,560
I think it would look like a really good language.

1647
03:30:02,560 --> 03:30:05,560
Oh right.

1648
03:30:05,560 --> 03:30:14,560
Robert Heinlein has some stories in which the super intelligent people have a language that's so dense

1649
03:30:14,560 --> 03:30:20,560
that in five syllables they can explain something that would take you a half hour.

1650
03:30:20,560 --> 03:30:27,560
I think, I forget what it's, log land.

1651
03:30:27,560 --> 03:30:33,560
Anyway, if you need a good idea, read Robert Heinlein.

1652
03:30:33,560 --> 03:30:35,560
Sure.

1653
03:30:35,560 --> 03:30:37,560
I thought you already mentioned this.

1654
03:30:37,560 --> 03:30:48,560
When you talk about how geniuses, they might have just come up with better ways to think better,

1655
03:30:48,560 --> 03:30:58,560
like better ways to think, better ways to learn about how to better learn from better learning.

1656
03:30:58,560 --> 03:31:02,560
But why do you think they never mention it?

1657
03:31:02,560 --> 03:31:12,560
And why hasn't they propagated them better and learning about how better to learn from it?

1658
03:31:12,560 --> 03:31:14,560
That's a great question.

1659
03:31:15,560 --> 03:31:33,560
Do you think people have a concept of an idea that improves better learning?

1660
03:31:33,560 --> 03:31:41,560
There's a couple of phenomena that, like, how come there were so many geniuses in Athens?

1661
03:31:42,560 --> 03:31:58,560
And then some of the best mathematicians came from some high school in some little country next to the Baltic.

1662
03:31:58,560 --> 03:32:00,560
Bulgaria?

1663
03:32:00,560 --> 03:32:02,560
Romania.

1664
03:32:02,560 --> 03:32:08,560
Yes, there was some high school in Romania that not only produced von Neumann,

1665
03:32:08,560 --> 03:32:12,560
but about five or six other world-class mathematicians.

1666
03:32:12,560 --> 03:32:14,560
I don't remember the details.

1667
03:32:14,560 --> 03:32:15,560
So that's a nice question.

1668
03:32:15,560 --> 03:32:26,560
How come, if there are these great memes, how come there aren't more big pockets of them?

1669
03:32:26,560 --> 03:32:34,560
But there are a lot of cultures which were very inventive in other than intellectual fields.

1670
03:32:34,560 --> 03:32:37,560
How come Paris got all those artists?

1671
03:32:37,560 --> 03:32:40,560
How many of you saw the Woody Allen movie?

1672
03:32:40,560 --> 03:32:42,560
What's it called?

1673
03:32:42,560 --> 03:32:47,560
Paris at Midnight?

1674
03:32:47,560 --> 03:32:53,560
So funny.

1675
03:32:53,560 --> 03:32:56,560
Like, would you be able to say no one?

1676
03:32:56,560 --> 03:33:04,560
Say one idea that would improve, you know, your improvement of learning.

1677
03:33:04,560 --> 03:33:06,560
Right.

1678
03:33:06,560 --> 03:33:09,560
That's a good question for each of us.

1679
03:33:09,560 --> 03:33:11,560
What's your very best idea?

1680
03:33:11,560 --> 03:33:19,560
And stop fussing with the other ones and get that one out.

1681
03:33:19,560 --> 03:33:25,560
There must be some people who are very quiet and only speak once in a long time.

1682
03:33:25,560 --> 03:33:28,560
We should watch them carefully.

1683
03:33:28,560 --> 03:33:30,560
Yes?

1684
03:33:30,560 --> 03:33:35,560
I guess along with like, do you ever feel restricted by language?

1685
03:33:35,560 --> 03:33:41,560
Wait.

1686
03:33:41,560 --> 03:33:47,560
It's the sound I can't hear.

1687
03:33:47,560 --> 03:33:54,560
Am I strong enough to lift you?

1688
03:33:54,560 --> 03:33:57,560
I'm sure someone's done it.

1689
03:33:57,560 --> 03:34:00,560
Sorry about that.

1690
03:34:00,560 --> 03:34:11,560
Do you ever feel restricted by language and that you must represent your theory of mind or any theory of language?

1691
03:34:11,560 --> 03:34:12,560
No, I don't.

1692
03:34:12,560 --> 03:34:29,560
But I once was jealous when Papert explained that he got some idea and he explained he gets ideas like that when he thinks in French.

1693
03:34:29,560 --> 03:34:30,560
What?

1694
03:34:30,560 --> 03:34:31,560
You draw pictures too.

1695
03:34:31,560 --> 03:34:32,560
Oh, yeah.

1696
03:34:32,560 --> 03:34:33,560
So it's not just language.

1697
03:34:33,560 --> 03:34:35,560
That's a language.

1698
03:34:35,560 --> 03:34:38,560
Graphics.

1699
03:34:38,560 --> 03:34:50,560
So we ought to have devices within the next few years that draw pictures when you think.

1700
03:34:50,560 --> 03:34:52,560
It's so funny.

1701
03:34:52,560 --> 03:34:55,560
You know, we had cyborgs.

1702
03:34:55,560 --> 03:34:57,560
What were they called?

1703
03:34:57,560 --> 03:34:58,560
I mentioned them last time.

1704
03:34:58,560 --> 03:35:04,560
We had Steve Mann and who's the other one?

1705
03:35:04,560 --> 03:35:06,560
Yeah.

1706
03:35:06,560 --> 03:35:19,560
So there's these two guys around the Media Lab wearing various things on their head and they're always typing and you ask them a question and they've searched Google.

1707
03:35:19,560 --> 03:35:24,560
And when was that?

1708
03:35:24,560 --> 03:35:30,560
1990.

1709
03:35:30,560 --> 03:35:32,560
But it's all gone.

1710
03:35:32,560 --> 03:35:38,560
Nobody walks around with direct connection to the web.

1711
03:35:38,560 --> 03:35:40,560
Yes.

1712
03:35:40,560 --> 03:35:46,560
Anyway, I certainly expected it to turn up and something wrong.

1713
03:35:46,560 --> 03:35:50,560
So anyway, you should be able to buy one one of these days.

1714
03:35:50,560 --> 03:35:54,560
And what's your name?

1715
03:35:54,560 --> 03:36:01,560
Who is that nice woman who had the EEG thing?

1716
03:36:01,560 --> 03:36:06,560
Do you remember a Ted?

1717
03:36:06,560 --> 03:36:07,560
Forgot her name.

1718
03:36:07,560 --> 03:36:15,560
Anyway, she had this sort of helmet which had about 20 electrodes and she induced me to put it on.

1719
03:36:15,560 --> 03:36:21,560
I was on a stage with about a thousand people there, which was rather funny.

1720
03:36:21,560 --> 03:36:34,560
And there's a little spot on a CRT and I get to think about it moving one way or the other and rewarding it when it did the right thing for only about half a minute.

1721
03:36:34,560 --> 03:36:36,560
And then I could steer it around.

1722
03:36:36,560 --> 03:36:46,560
So here was a nice primitive gadget where you could sort of almost draw just by thinking this spot.

1723
03:36:46,560 --> 03:36:53,560
And then she started a company and hasn't sent me one.

1724
03:36:53,560 --> 03:36:56,560
Because maybe it was just beginners luck.

1725
03:36:56,560 --> 03:37:01,560
Beginners luck or something.

1726
03:37:01,560 --> 03:37:02,560
What?

1727
03:37:02,560 --> 03:37:04,560
Her name is Holly.

1728
03:37:04,560 --> 03:37:10,560
Yes, Lee.

1729
03:37:10,560 --> 03:37:15,560
Did you find the company?

1730
03:37:15,560 --> 03:37:21,560
Do you think there would be lots of people wearing stuff?

1731
03:37:21,560 --> 03:37:27,560
With your keyboard, right?

1732
03:37:27,560 --> 03:37:29,560
Why don't we take a five minute break?

1733
03:37:29,560 --> 03:37:50,560
I don't know.

1734
03:37:50,560 --> 03:38:14,560
Well, I hate to interrupt because I see ten different productive discussions.

1735
03:38:14,560 --> 03:38:27,560
I know.

1736
03:38:27,560 --> 03:38:29,560
Yes, I see.

1737
03:38:29,560 --> 03:38:33,560
I saw quite a few apparently productive discussions.

1738
03:38:33,560 --> 03:38:35,560
Maybe that's what the class needs.

1739
03:38:35,560 --> 03:38:41,560
But anybody come to a conclusion?

1740
03:38:41,560 --> 03:38:50,560
Yeah.

1741
03:38:50,560 --> 03:38:55,560
See if you can knock the wall down.

1742
03:38:55,560 --> 03:38:57,560
It's not a conclusion, but it's a question.

1743
03:38:57,560 --> 03:38:58,560
It's a thought experiment.

1744
03:38:58,560 --> 03:39:02,560
So if you had a black box that could sort of replace part of your brain.

1745
03:39:02,560 --> 03:39:06,560
And let's say you could replace like five percent at a time.

1746
03:39:06,560 --> 03:39:08,560
If you assume that there's a self entity.

1747
03:39:08,560 --> 03:39:14,560
At what point would you lose yourself?

1748
03:39:15,560 --> 03:39:33,560
If you change the question is, are you how how much do you have in common with with the you of yesterday as compared to when you graduated grade school?

1749
03:39:33,560 --> 03:39:46,560
So this question of the idea of identity is very, very fuzzy.

1750
03:39:46,560 --> 03:40:15,560
Yeah, I read a science fiction novel by Robert Sawyer.

1751
03:40:15,560 --> 03:40:31,560
And if you know of him, Canadian writer and it has to do with somebody who has a fatal disease.

1752
03:40:31,560 --> 03:40:34,560
So he's going to die soon.

1753
03:40:34,560 --> 03:40:40,560
But the technology is around where you can make a duplicate of him.

1754
03:40:40,560 --> 03:40:50,560
And so he has a duplicate made and he is sent to the moon for some reasons.

1755
03:40:50,560 --> 03:41:04,560
I can't remember, which is a kind of nursing home for I think people who are enfeebled and do much better with one seventh of gravity.

1756
03:41:04,560 --> 03:41:15,560
So there's some reason why anyway the living the original copy is sent to the moon and the substitute takes over.

1757
03:41:15,560 --> 03:41:26,560
But then our hero is miraculously cured by eating the right stem cells or what I don't remember.

1758
03:41:27,560 --> 03:41:36,560
So he wants to come back and the question is who gets the car?

1759
03:41:36,560 --> 03:41:47,560
So I can't remember the title of the novel except that it has alien in it.

1760
03:41:47,560 --> 03:41:56,560
Alienable rights is not something like that, but I wrote an article called alienable rights.

1761
03:41:56,560 --> 03:42:05,560
Anyway, so are you the same as you were five minutes ago or five years ago or whatever?

1762
03:42:05,560 --> 03:42:11,560
And as far as I'm concerned, the answer is who cares?

1763
03:42:11,560 --> 03:42:20,560
It's a sort of silly question because no two things are exactly the same ever anyway.

1764
03:42:20,560 --> 03:42:27,560
But again, a lot of these questions which look philosophical are legal.

1765
03:42:28,560 --> 03:42:44,560
The joke of that novel is that who owns the car is what matters to decide who is the real original and who's the copy.

1766
03:42:44,560 --> 03:42:59,560
Frederick Paul wrote a similar story much longer ago where people are copied and the copy is sent on a one way trip to some planet to fix a broken reactor.

1767
03:42:59,560 --> 03:43:06,560
And they always die and you get a million dollars for providing this copy.

1768
03:43:06,560 --> 03:43:12,560
But one of the copies survives so it's the same plot.

1769
03:43:12,560 --> 03:43:15,560
I can't remember that.

1770
03:43:15,560 --> 03:43:31,560
If you're looking for a good idea, if you go to 1950s science fiction, look for A.E. Van Voter, Frederick Paul or all those wonderful writers.

1771
03:43:31,560 --> 03:43:37,560
That was before it was necessary to describe really good characters.

1772
03:43:37,560 --> 03:43:53,560
And science fiction got better and better for the literary critics and generally worse and worse for the science fiction fans.

1773
03:43:53,560 --> 03:43:56,560
Do we really have any more questions?

1774
03:43:56,560 --> 03:43:58,560
Yes.

1775
03:43:58,560 --> 03:44:08,560
We're in a time age where sharing information between many people on a short amount of time is quite easy.

1776
03:44:08,560 --> 03:44:11,560
Do you think that this will change?

1777
03:44:11,560 --> 03:44:16,560
This will bring up many more ideas. Do you think that this will hinder?

1778
03:44:16,560 --> 03:44:23,560
Because before this time people had problems with sharing information.

1779
03:44:23,560 --> 03:44:29,560
And also now it's touching to hear from a large group of people working on one thing.

1780
03:44:29,560 --> 03:44:35,560
Do you think that this will change the way that we think and do you think that this will make us better?

1781
03:44:35,560 --> 03:44:47,560
It's a tough one. Bad things can happen and good things can happen.

1782
03:44:47,560 --> 03:44:50,560
Funny, because that reminds me again of science fiction.

1783
03:44:50,560 --> 03:45:00,560
Because in science fiction many, many years ago some writers got the idea that there would be something like an internet.

1784
03:45:00,560 --> 03:45:04,560
And some people realized there would be flash crowds.

1785
03:45:04,560 --> 03:45:07,560
And now there are flash crowds.

1786
03:45:07,560 --> 03:45:14,560
And I remember even as a kid talking to people who said,

1787
03:45:14,560 --> 03:45:20,560
why not wire up the voting machines so that they're always there?

1788
03:45:20,560 --> 03:45:27,560
And so if somebody in the government wants to know should we do this or that?

1789
03:45:27,560 --> 03:45:32,560
Should we bomb China or not?

1790
03:45:32,560 --> 03:45:39,560
You could get 100 million people to run up to the keyboard and say yes or no.

1791
03:45:39,560 --> 03:45:46,560
Presumably when the, what do they call those?

1792
03:45:46,560 --> 03:45:56,560
That great crowd of Jeffersons and Franklins and the Founding Fathers did a lot of things to prevent that.

1793
03:45:56,560 --> 03:46:04,560
And the one that they focused on, which was one of the most effective, was called the Electoral College.

1794
03:46:04,560 --> 03:46:11,560
And the United States is different from other places because we don't elect congressmen or presidents.

1795
03:46:11,560 --> 03:46:19,560
We elect smart people from the community who then get together and decide who should be president.

1796
03:46:19,560 --> 03:46:27,560
And of course now if anybody, now they belong to parties and if any of them voted for the other party's candidate,

1797
03:46:27,560 --> 03:46:30,560
they would be held to pay.

1798
03:46:30,560 --> 03:46:40,560
But it was a great idea because the Founding Fathers realized that if you had instant feedback, which is what Hitler got,

1799
03:46:40,560 --> 03:46:47,560
then you could say something really exciting and everybody would press the yes button and then you kill all the Jews.

1800
03:46:47,560 --> 03:46:58,560
And then the next speech you kill all the black people and all the yellow people and all the people whose last name doesn't begin with M.

1801
03:46:58,560 --> 03:47:03,560
And so what you don't want is instant feedback.

1802
03:47:03,560 --> 03:47:08,560
Now the new social networks are getting us close to that.

1803
03:47:08,560 --> 03:47:16,560
And the question is, is it time to have, is it time to stop that?

1804
03:47:16,560 --> 03:47:19,560
Is it getting dangerous? I don't know.

1805
03:47:19,560 --> 03:47:30,560
But there must be a lot of people who are recognizing that this thing is creeping up on us and you might be able to get 50 million people

1806
03:47:30,560 --> 03:47:38,560
to do something reckless in a few minutes if you don't put some limits.

1807
03:47:38,560 --> 03:47:49,560
I don't think we could get the electoral college back because you'd have to get a majority to, what does it take to fix the Constitution?

1808
03:47:49,560 --> 03:47:54,560
Two thirds?

1809
03:47:54,560 --> 03:47:58,560
We'll never see two thirds again.

1810
03:47:58,560 --> 03:48:03,560
It's the end of America.

1811
03:48:03,560 --> 03:48:11,560
Well, we have three minutes.

1812
03:48:11,560 --> 03:48:12,560
Yes?

1813
03:48:12,560 --> 03:48:19,560
If you would design a direction for the field of psychology, obviously one word is a set of debugging tools.

1814
03:48:19,560 --> 03:48:24,560
Why don't you say they should be doing it?

1815
03:48:24,560 --> 03:48:28,560
They should read Patrick Winston's thesis.

1816
03:48:28,560 --> 03:48:41,560
The psychologists now have disappeared into the tar pit of statistics and they don't have the idea that knowledge needs complicated representations.

1817
03:48:41,560 --> 03:48:51,560
And I don't care whether you assign probabilities to them or put them in the order in which you thought of them or, you know,

1818
03:48:51,560 --> 03:49:04,560
or do what Doug Lenet did in his thesis of swapping things when one worked better than another, but I forget the question.

1819
03:49:04,560 --> 03:49:11,560
But I think we've got to get better ideas about representation of knowledge.

1820
03:49:11,560 --> 03:49:26,560
I don't know where they're going to come from now that the whole AI community is drifting into these ways of avoiding representations.

1821
03:49:26,560 --> 03:49:30,560
I haven't read the Norvig, Russell, book.

1822
03:49:30,560 --> 03:49:40,560
Does he, can anybody summarize what it says about knowledge representation?

1823
03:49:40,560 --> 03:49:44,560
Who's read it?

1824
03:49:44,560 --> 03:49:48,560
There's a chapter on logic for sort of logic.

1825
03:49:48,560 --> 03:49:51,560
That's so funny.

1826
03:49:51,560 --> 03:50:05,560
First order of logic is what Newell and Simon thought of in 1956 before they thought of the so-called GPS thing.

1827
03:50:05,560 --> 03:50:07,560
Logic can't make analogies.

1828
03:50:07,560 --> 03:50:13,560
It's a very bad thing to get stuck with.

1829
03:50:13,560 --> 03:50:23,560
Zero or one.

1830
03:50:23,560 --> 03:50:28,560
Maybe one of our papers should be on what should AI do next year.

1831
03:50:28,560 --> 03:50:46,560
So really what my main concern it has been for quite a few years is to make some theory of how,

1832
03:50:46,560 --> 03:50:52,560
what makes people able to solve so many kinds of problems.

1833
03:50:52,560 --> 03:51:00,560
I guess if you ran through the spectrum of all the animals,

1834
03:51:00,560 --> 03:51:06,560
you'd find lots of problems that some animals can solve and people can't,

1835
03:51:06,560 --> 03:51:15,560
like how many of you could build a beaver dam or a termite nest.

1836
03:51:15,560 --> 03:51:21,560
So there are all sorts of things that evolution manages to produce.

1837
03:51:21,560 --> 03:51:34,560
But maybe the most impressive one is what the human infant can do just by hanging around for 10 or 20 or 30 years

1838
03:51:34,560 --> 03:51:39,560
and watching what other humans can do.

1839
03:51:39,560 --> 03:51:42,560
So we can solve all sorts of problems.

1840
03:51:42,560 --> 03:51:52,560
And my quarrel with the rest of the, most of the artificial intelligence community,

1841
03:51:52,560 --> 03:52:03,560
has been that the great success of science in the last 500 years really has been in physics

1842
03:52:03,560 --> 03:52:15,560
and it's been rewarded by finding little sets of rules like Newton's three laws and Maxwell's four laws

1843
03:52:15,560 --> 03:52:29,560
and Einstein's one law or two that explained a huge range of everyday phenomena.

1844
03:52:29,560 --> 03:52:39,560
Of course in the 1920s and 30s that apple cart got upset because actually Einstein himself

1845
03:52:39,560 --> 03:52:51,560
who had discovered the first quantum phenomena, namely the quantization of photons,

1846
03:52:51,560 --> 03:53:00,560
had produced various scientific laboratory observations that were inexplicable

1847
03:53:00,560 --> 03:53:08,560
in terms of either Maxwell or Newton or Einstein's earlier formulations.

1848
03:53:08,560 --> 03:53:16,560
So my picture of the history is that in the 19th century

1849
03:53:16,560 --> 03:53:25,560
and a little bit earlier going back to Locke and Spinoza and Hume and a few of those philosophers, even Immanuel Kant,

1850
03:53:25,560 --> 03:53:29,560
they had some pretty good psychological ideas.

1851
03:53:29,560 --> 03:53:39,560
And as I mentioned the other day, I suspect that Aristotle was more like a modern cognitive psychologist

1852
03:53:39,560 --> 03:53:46,560
and had even better ideas but we've probably lost a lot of them because there are no tape recorders.

1853
03:53:46,560 --> 03:53:58,560
Who knows what Aristotle and Plato said that their students didn't write down because it sounded silly.

1854
03:53:58,560 --> 03:54:13,560
So the idea that we developed around here mostly Seymour Papert and a lot of students,

1855
03:54:13,560 --> 03:54:27,560
Pat Winston was one of the great stars of that period was the idea that to get anything like human intellectual abilities

1856
03:54:27,560 --> 03:54:32,560
you're going to have to have all sorts of high level representations.

1857
03:54:32,560 --> 03:54:43,560
So one has to say the old conditioned reflex of stimulus versus stimulus producing a response isn't good enough.

1858
03:54:43,560 --> 03:54:51,560
The stimulus has to be represented by some kind of semantic structure somewhere in the brain or mind.

1859
03:54:52,560 --> 03:55:07,560
And so far as I know it's only in the theories of not even modern artificial intelligence but the AI of the 60s and 70s and 80s

1860
03:55:07,560 --> 03:55:18,560
that people thought about what could be the internal representation of the kinds of things that we think about.

1861
03:55:19,560 --> 03:55:28,560
And even more important, if one of those representations you see something or you remember some incident

1862
03:55:28,560 --> 03:55:37,560
and your brain represents it in some way and if that way doesn't work you take a breath and you sort of stumble around

1863
03:55:37,560 --> 03:55:40,560
and find another way to represent it.

1864
03:55:40,560 --> 03:55:46,560
Maybe when the original event first happened you represented it in three or four ways.

1865
03:55:46,560 --> 03:55:53,560
And so we're beginning to see, did anybody hear Faroochi's talk?

1866
03:55:53,560 --> 03:56:01,560
The Watson guy was up here a couple of days ago, I missed it,

1867
03:56:01,560 --> 03:56:10,560
but they haven't made a technical publication as far as I know of how this Watson program works

1868
03:56:10,560 --> 03:56:18,560
but it sounds like it's something of an interesting society of mind-like structure and it would be nice if they would...

1869
03:56:18,560 --> 03:56:22,560
Has anybody read any long paper on it?

1870
03:56:22,560 --> 03:56:24,560
There have been a lot of press reports.

1871
03:56:24,560 --> 03:56:26,560
Have you seen anything, Pat?

1872
03:56:28,560 --> 03:56:34,560
So anyway they seem to have done some sorts of common sense reasoning.

1873
03:56:34,560 --> 03:56:43,560
As I said the other day, I doubt that Watson could understand why you can pull something with a string but you can't push.

1874
03:56:43,560 --> 03:56:52,560
And actually I don't know if any existing program can understand that yet.

1875
03:56:53,560 --> 03:57:00,560
I saw some amazing demonstrations yesterday by...

1876
03:57:00,560 --> 03:57:10,560
Or Monday by Steve Wolfram of his Wolfram Alpha,

1877
03:57:10,560 --> 03:57:15,560
which doesn't do much common sense reasoning but it has...

1878
03:57:15,560 --> 03:57:22,560
What it does do is, if you put it in a sentence, it finds five or ten different representations,

1879
03:57:22,560 --> 03:57:25,560
anything you can find that's sort of mathematical.

1880
03:57:25,560 --> 03:57:36,560
And so when you ask it a question it gives you ten answers and it's much better than previous systems because it doesn't...

1881
03:57:36,560 --> 03:57:42,560
Well, Google gives you a quarter million answers but that's too many.

1882
03:57:43,560 --> 03:57:53,560
Anyway, I'm just going to talk a little bit more and just...

1883
03:57:53,560 --> 03:58:00,560
Everybody should be trying to think of a question that the rest of the class might answer.

1884
03:58:00,560 --> 03:58:06,560
So there are lots of different kinds of problems that people can solve going back to the first one,

1885
03:58:06,560 --> 03:58:15,560
like which moving object out there is my mother and which might be a potential threat.

1886
03:58:15,560 --> 03:58:19,560
So there are a lot of kinds of problems that we solve.

1887
03:58:19,560 --> 03:58:33,560
And I've never seen any discussion in psychology books of what are the activities, principal activities of common sense thinking.

1888
03:58:33,560 --> 03:58:41,560
Somehow they don't have...

1889
03:58:41,560 --> 03:58:47,560
Before computers there really wasn't any way to think about high-level thinking

1890
03:58:47,560 --> 03:58:56,560
because there weren't any technically usable ways to describe complicated processes.

1891
03:58:56,560 --> 03:59:07,560
The idea of a conditional expression was barely on the threshold of psychology.

1892
03:59:07,560 --> 03:59:10,560
So what kinds of problems do we have?

1893
03:59:10,560 --> 03:59:20,560
And if you take some particular problem like I find these days I can't get the top off bottles.

1894
03:59:20,560 --> 03:59:22,560
So how do I solve that?

1895
03:59:23,560 --> 03:59:26,560
There are lots of answers.

1896
03:59:26,560 --> 03:59:43,560
One is you look for somebody who looks really strong or you reach into your pocket and you probably have one of these.

1897
03:59:43,560 --> 03:59:45,560
And so on.

1898
03:59:45,560 --> 03:59:54,560
There must be some way to put it on the floor and step on it and kick it with the other foot.

1899
03:59:54,560 --> 03:59:58,560
So there are lots of problems that we're facing every day.

1900
03:59:58,560 --> 04:00:04,560
And if you look in traditional cognitive psychology you're...

1901
04:00:04,560 --> 04:00:06,560
Well, what's the worst theory?

1902
04:00:06,560 --> 04:00:12,560
The worst and the best theory got popular in the 1980s.

1903
04:00:12,560 --> 04:00:20,560
It was called rule-based systems and you just have a big library which says if you have a soda bottle

1904
04:00:20,560 --> 04:00:25,560
and you can't get the cap off then do this or that or the other.

1905
04:00:25,560 --> 04:00:31,560
And so some people decided well that's really all you need.

1906
04:00:31,560 --> 04:00:39,560
Rod Brooks in the 1980s sort of said we don't need those fancy theories

1907
04:00:39,560 --> 04:00:43,560
that people like Minsky and Papert and Winston are working on.

1908
04:00:43,560 --> 04:00:52,560
Why not just say for each situation in the outer world have a rule that says how to deal with that situation?

1909
04:00:52,560 --> 04:00:54,560
Let's make a hierarchy of them.

1910
04:00:54,560 --> 04:01:01,560
And he described a system that sort of looked like the priority interrupt system in a computer.

1911
04:01:01,560 --> 04:01:10,560
And he won all sorts of prizes for this really bad idea that's spread around the world.

1912
04:01:10,560 --> 04:01:13,560
But it solved a lot of problems.

1913
04:01:13,560 --> 04:01:17,560
There are things about priority interrupt that aren't obvious.

1914
04:01:17,560 --> 04:01:20,560
Like suppose you have...

1915
04:01:20,560 --> 04:01:26,560
In the first computers there was some problem because what should you do

1916
04:01:26,560 --> 04:01:30,560
if there are several signals coming into the computer and you want to respond to them.

1917
04:01:30,560 --> 04:01:37,560
And some of the signals are very fast and very short.

1918
04:01:37,560 --> 04:01:47,560
Then you might think well I should give the highest priority to the signal that's going to be there the shortest time.

1919
04:01:47,560 --> 04:01:49,560
Something like that.

1920
04:01:49,560 --> 04:01:57,560
The funny part is that when you made such a system the result was that if you had a computer

1921
04:01:57,560 --> 04:02:02,560
that was responding to some signal that's coming in at a...

1922
04:02:02,560 --> 04:02:07,560
I'm talking about the days when computers were only working at a few kilohertz.

1923
04:02:07,560 --> 04:02:09,560
A few thousand operations a second.

1924
04:02:09,560 --> 04:02:11,560
God that's slow.

1925
04:02:11,560 --> 04:02:16,560
A billion times shorter than what you have in your pocket.

1926
04:02:16,560 --> 04:02:24,560
And if you give priority to the signals that have to be reacted to very fast

1927
04:02:24,560 --> 04:02:30,560
then what happens if you type to those computers it would never see them because it's always...

1928
04:02:30,560 --> 04:02:32,560
I saw this happening once.

1929
04:02:32,560 --> 04:02:41,560
And finally somebody realized that you should give the highest priority to the inputs that come in most...

1930
04:02:41,560 --> 04:02:44,560
least frequently.

1931
04:02:44,560 --> 04:02:51,560
Because otherwise if there's something coming in very frequently you'll just always be responding to it.

1932
04:02:51,560 --> 04:02:56,560
Any of you run into this?

1933
04:02:56,560 --> 04:03:01,560
It took me a while to figure out why.

1934
04:03:01,560 --> 04:03:04,560
Anyway there are lots of kinds of problems.

1935
04:03:04,560 --> 04:03:16,560
And the other day I was complaining that we didn't have enough ways to...

1936
04:03:16,560 --> 04:03:24,560
We had hundreds of words for emotions and here's a couple of dozen.

1937
04:03:24,560 --> 04:03:29,560
There are chapters seven and eight actually most of these.

1938
04:03:29,560 --> 04:03:36,560
So here's a bunch of words for describing ways to think but they're not very technical.

1939
04:03:36,560 --> 04:03:42,560
So you can talk about remorse and sorrow and blah blah blah.

1940
04:03:42,560 --> 04:03:52,560
Hundreds and hundreds of words for feelings and it's a lot of effort to find a dozen words for...

1941
04:03:52,560 --> 04:03:59,560
for intellectual, for what should I call them, problem-solving processes.

1942
04:03:59,560 --> 04:04:08,560
So it's curious to me that the great field called cognitive psychology has not focused in that direction.

1943
04:04:08,560 --> 04:04:18,560
Anyway here's about 20 or 30 of them and you'll find them scattered through chapters seven and eight.

1944
04:04:18,560 --> 04:04:27,560
Here's my favorite one and I don't know of any proper name for it but if you're trying to solve a problem and you're stuck...

1945
04:04:27,560 --> 04:04:36,560
and the example that comes to my mind is if I'm trying to remember someone's name I can tell when it's hopeless.

1946
04:04:36,560 --> 04:04:48,560
And the reason is that for somehow or other I know that there's a huge tree of choices.

1947
04:04:48,560 --> 04:04:59,560
That's one way to represent what's going on and I might know that I'm sure that that letter, that name has a Z in it.

1948
04:04:59,560 --> 04:05:03,560
So you search around and try everything you can.

1949
04:05:03,560 --> 04:05:07,560
But of course it doesn't have a Z.

1950
04:05:07,560 --> 04:05:32,560
So the way to solve that problem is to give up and then a couple of minutes later the name occurs to you and you have no idea how it happened and so forth.

1951
04:05:32,560 --> 04:05:52,560
So anyway the long story is that Papert and I and lots of really great students in the 60s and 70s spent a lot of time making little models of problem solvers that didn't work.

1952
04:05:52,560 --> 04:05:58,560
We discovered that you needed something else and we put that in.

1953
04:05:58,560 --> 04:06:03,560
Other people would come and say that's hopeless.

1954
04:06:03,560 --> 04:06:15,560
You're putting in more things than you need and my conclusion is that wow it's the opposite of physics and physics you're always trying to find.

1955
04:06:15,560 --> 04:06:27,560
You don't want to what is it called Occam's razor never have more structure than you need because because what well it'll waste your time.

1956
04:06:27,560 --> 04:06:35,560
But my feeling was I never have less than you'll need but you don't know how many you'll need.

1957
04:06:35,560 --> 04:06:48,560
So what I did I had four of these and then I forced myself to put in two more and people ask what's the difference between self models and self conscious processes and I don't care.

1958
04:06:48,560 --> 04:06:52,560
What's the difference between self conscious and reflective.

1959
04:06:52,560 --> 04:06:54,560
I don't care.

1960
04:06:54,560 --> 04:07:00,560
And the reason is that wow it's nice to have a box that isn't full yet.

1961
04:07:00,560 --> 04:07:10,560
So if you find something that your previous theory going back to Brooks.

1962
04:07:10,560 --> 04:07:20,560
He was so successful getting simple robots to work that he concluded that the things didn't need any internal representations at all.

1963
04:07:20,560 --> 04:07:31,560
And for some mysterious reason the artificial intelligence society gave him their annual big prize for for this very wrong idea.

1964
04:07:31,560 --> 04:07:41,560
And it caused a research to sort of half collapse in places like Japan and said oh rule based systems is all we need.

1965
04:07:41,560 --> 04:07:45,560
Anybody want to defend him.

1966
04:07:45,560 --> 04:07:53,560
The odd thing is if you talk to Brooks he's one of the best philosophers you'll ever meet and he says oh yes of course that's wrong.

1967
04:07:53,560 --> 04:07:59,560
But it helps people do research and get things done.

1968
04:07:59,560 --> 04:08:13,560
As I think I mentioned the other day when the Three Mile Island thing happened there was no way to get into the reactor.

1969
04:08:13,560 --> 04:08:26,560
That was 1980 and 30 years later when the what's how do you pronounce it Fukushima accident happened.

1970
04:08:26,560 --> 04:08:42,560
There was no robot that could go in and open a door and I don't know who to blame for that maybe us.

1971
04:08:42,560 --> 04:08:48,560
But my picture of the history is that the places that did research on robotics.

1972
04:08:49,560 --> 04:09:00,560
There are quite a few places and for example Carnegie Mellon was very impressive in getting the Sony dogs to play soccer.

1973
04:09:00,560 --> 04:09:11,560
And they're still at it and I think I mentioned that Sony still has a stock of what's it called.

1974
04:09:11,560 --> 04:09:13,560
Say it again.

1975
04:09:13,560 --> 04:09:15,560
FIBO.

1976
04:09:15,560 --> 04:09:17,560
Right.

1977
04:09:17,560 --> 04:09:19,560
I Bose.

1978
04:09:19,560 --> 04:09:22,560
Right.

1979
04:09:22,560 --> 04:09:33,560
But the trouble is they're always broken and we had a there was a robot here called Cog that Brooks made and it sometimes worked.

1980
04:09:33,560 --> 04:09:40,560
But usually it wasn't working and so only one student at a time could experiment with the robot.

1981
04:09:40,560 --> 04:09:47,560
What was that wonderful project of trying to make a walking machine for four years in.

1982
04:09:47,560 --> 04:09:54,560
There was a project to make a robot walk and there was only one of it.

1983
04:09:54,560 --> 04:10:03,560
So first only one student at a time can do research on it and most of the time it's something's broken and you're fixing it.

1984
04:10:03,560 --> 04:10:16,560
And so you end up that you sort of get five or ten hours a week on your laboratory physical robot at the same time.

1985
04:10:16,560 --> 04:10:28,560
Ed Fredkin had a student who tried to make a walking robot and it was a stick figure on the screen and I forgot the student's name.

1986
04:10:28,560 --> 04:10:41,560
But anyway he simulated gravity and a few other things and in a couple of weeks he had a pretty good robot that could walk and go around turns and bank.

1987
04:10:41,560 --> 04:10:57,560
And if you put if you simulated an oily floor it could slip and fall which we considered the high point of the demo actually.

1988
04:10:57,560 --> 04:11:15,560
So anyway I've sort of asked you to read my two books for this course.

1989
04:11:15,560 --> 04:11:22,560
But those are not the only good texts about artificial intelligence.

1990
04:11:22,560 --> 04:11:45,560
If you want to dig deeper it might be a good idea to go to the web and type in Aaron Sloman S L O M A N and you'll get to his website which is something like that.

1991
04:11:45,560 --> 04:11:53,560
And Sloman is a sort of philosopher who can program.

1992
04:11:53,560 --> 04:12:04,560
There are a handful of them in the world and he has lots of interesting ideas that nobody's gotten to carry out.

1993
04:12:04,560 --> 04:12:12,560
And so I recommend.

1994
04:12:12,560 --> 04:12:14,560
Who else is.

1995
04:12:14,560 --> 04:12:25,560
Pat do you ever recommend anyone else.

1996
04:12:25,560 --> 04:12:35,560
I'm trying to think.

1997
04:12:35,560 --> 04:12:38,560
I mean if you're looking for a lot for philosophers.

1998
04:12:38,560 --> 04:12:51,560
Dan Dennett has a lot of ideas but but Sloman is the only person I'd say is a sort of real professional philosopher who tries to program.

1999
04:12:51,560 --> 04:13:00,560
At least some of his ideas and he has successful students who have made larger systems work.

2000
04:13:00,560 --> 04:13:10,560
So if you get tired of me and you ought to then go look at this guy and see who he recommends.

2001
04:13:10,560 --> 04:13:16,560
So OK any who has a good question to ask.

2002
04:13:17,560 --> 04:13:29,560
It's a mystery but.

2003
04:13:29,560 --> 04:13:39,560
I spent most of the couple of days making this list bigger.

2004
04:13:39,560 --> 04:13:49,560
But these aren't you know these are things that you do when you're thinking you make analogies.

2005
04:13:49,560 --> 04:14:02,560
If you have multiple goals you try to pick the most important one or in some cases if you have several goals maybe you should try to achieve the easiest one.

2006
04:14:02,560 --> 04:14:11,560
And there's a chance that it'll lead you into what to do about the harder ones but.

2007
04:14:11,560 --> 04:14:16,560
A lot of people think that mostly in England.

2008
04:14:16,560 --> 04:14:20,560
That logic is a good way to do reasoning.

2009
04:14:20,560 --> 04:14:23,560
And that's completely wrong.

2010
04:14:24,560 --> 04:14:31,560
Because in logic first of all you can't do analogies at all except at a very high level.

2011
04:14:31,560 --> 04:14:41,560
It takes four or five nested quantifiers to say A is to B is C is to which of the following five or.

2012
04:14:42,560 --> 04:14:47,560
So I've never seen anyone do analogical thinking.

2013
04:14:47,560 --> 04:14:55,560
Using formal logic first order or higher order predicate calculus.

2014
04:14:55,560 --> 04:14:57,560
What's logic good for.

2015
04:14:57,560 --> 04:15:00,560
It's great after you've solved a problem.

2016
04:15:00,560 --> 04:15:05,560
Because then you can formalize what you did and see if.

2017
04:15:05,560 --> 04:15:08,560
Some of the things you did weren't necessary.

2018
04:15:08,560 --> 04:15:18,560
In other words after you've got the solution to a problem which you got by going through a big search you finally found a path from A to Z.

2019
04:15:18,560 --> 04:15:22,560
And now you can.

2020
04:15:22,560 --> 04:15:31,560
See if the assumptions that you had to make to bridge all these various little gaps were all essential or not so.

2021
04:15:31,560 --> 04:15:33,560
Yes.

2022
04:15:33,560 --> 04:15:44,560
What example would you say that logic can do analogies like water is for water was like containment or like why.

2023
04:15:44,560 --> 04:15:46,560
Why.

2024
04:15:46,560 --> 04:15:49,560
Well.

2025
04:15:49,560 --> 04:15:52,560
Because you have to make a list of hypotheses.

2026
04:15:52,560 --> 04:15:56,560
And then let me see if I can find Evans.

2027
04:15:56,560 --> 04:16:00,560
The trouble is.

2028
04:16:00,560 --> 04:16:04,560
Don Evans name is in a picture.

2029
04:16:04,560 --> 04:16:08,560
And word can't look inside its pictures.

2030
04:16:08,560 --> 04:16:15,560
Can power can PowerPoint find words in its illustrations.

2031
04:16:15,560 --> 04:16:18,560
Why don't I use PowerPoint.

2032
04:16:18,560 --> 04:16:22,560
Because I've discovered that PowerPoint can't read.

2033
04:16:22,560 --> 04:16:30,560
Pictures made by other programs in the Microsoft Word suite.

2034
04:16:30,560 --> 04:16:34,560
The drawing program in Word is pretty good.

2035
04:16:34,560 --> 04:16:41,560
And then there's an operation in Word which will make a PowerPoint out of what you drew.

2036
04:16:41,560 --> 04:16:45,560
And.

2037
04:16:45,560 --> 04:16:55,560
It's 25 years since Microsoft hasn't fixed the fatal errors that it makes when you do that.

2038
04:16:55,560 --> 04:17:02,560
In other words I don't think that the PowerPoint and Word people communicate and they both make a lot of money.

2039
04:17:02,560 --> 04:17:08,560
So that might be that might be the reason.

2040
04:17:08,560 --> 04:17:14,560
Where was I.

2041
04:17:14,560 --> 04:17:18,560
Well you can do anything in logic if you try hard enough but.

2042
04:17:18,560 --> 04:17:20,560
But.

2043
04:17:20,560 --> 04:17:23,560
A is to be a C is to X.

2044
04:17:23,560 --> 04:17:26,560
Is a four part relation and.

2045
04:17:26,560 --> 04:17:31,560
You'd need a whole pile of quantifiers and.

2046
04:17:31,560 --> 04:17:34,560
How would you know what to do next.

2047
04:17:34,560 --> 04:17:36,560
Yes.

2048
04:17:36,560 --> 04:17:43,560
About the situation in which we are able to perform some sort of action like really fluently and really well.

2049
04:17:43,560 --> 04:17:46,560
But we cannot describe what we're doing.

2050
04:17:46,560 --> 04:17:52,560
And the example I give is say I'm like an expert African drummer from Africa.

2051
04:17:52,560 --> 04:17:54,560
And I can make these like really complicated rhythms.

2052
04:17:54,560 --> 04:17:59,560
But if you ask me what did you just do like I have no idea how to describe it.

2053
04:17:59,560 --> 04:18:04,560
And in that case do you think the person is capable of like.

2054
04:18:04,560 --> 04:18:11,560
Or I guess do you think the person we can say that the person understands this even though they cannot explain it.

2055
04:18:11,560 --> 04:18:13,560
Well.

2056
04:18:13,560 --> 04:18:18,560
But if you take an extreme form of that.

2057
04:18:18,560 --> 04:18:23,560
You can't explain why you used us any particular word for anything.

2058
04:18:23,560 --> 04:18:26,560
There's no reason.

2059
04:18:26,560 --> 04:18:31,560
It's remarkable how well people can do in everyday life.

2060
04:18:31,560 --> 04:18:36,560
To tell people how they got an idea but when you look at it.

2061
04:18:36,560 --> 04:18:40,560
It doesn't say how you would program a machine to do it.

2062
04:18:40,560 --> 04:18:43,560
So something very peculiar about.

2063
04:18:43,560 --> 04:18:48,560
The idea that.

2064
04:18:48,560 --> 04:18:51,560
Goes back to this.

2065
04:18:51,560 --> 04:18:54,560
This idea that people have free will and so forth.

2066
04:18:54,560 --> 04:18:57,560
Suppose I say.

2067
04:18:57,560 --> 04:19:01,560
Look at this and say.

2068
04:19:01,560 --> 04:19:04,560
This has a constriction at this point.

2069
04:19:04,560 --> 04:19:07,560
Why did I say constriction.

2070
04:19:07,560 --> 04:19:11,560
How do you get any how do you decide what word to use for something.

2071
04:19:11,560 --> 04:19:16,560
You have no idea.

2072
04:19:16,560 --> 04:19:19,560
So it's a very general question.

2073
04:19:19,560 --> 04:19:21,560
It's not clear that.

2074
04:19:21,560 --> 04:19:24,560
The different parts of the.

2075
04:19:24,560 --> 04:19:28,560
That the frontal lobes which might have something to do with.

2076
04:19:28,560 --> 04:19:32,560
Making plans and analyzing certain kinds of situations.

2077
04:19:32,560 --> 04:19:35,560
Have any access to what happens in the.

2078
04:19:35,560 --> 04:19:38,560
Broca or what's the.

2079
04:19:38,560 --> 04:19:43,560
What's the speech production area.

2080
04:19:43,560 --> 04:19:47,560
Broca and.

2081
04:19:47,560 --> 04:19:49,560
I'm trying to find the name of the other one.

2082
04:19:49,560 --> 04:19:51,560
It's connected by a cable that's.

2083
04:19:51,560 --> 04:19:55,560
About a quarter inch thick.

2084
04:19:55,560 --> 04:19:57,560
Yeah.

2085
04:19:57,560 --> 04:19:59,560
We have no idea.

2086
04:19:59,560 --> 04:20:01,560
How those work.

2087
04:20:01,560 --> 04:20:04,560
As far as I've never seen.

2088
04:20:04,560 --> 04:20:06,560
Any publication.

2089
04:20:06,560 --> 04:20:08,560
In neuroscience.

2090
04:20:08,560 --> 04:20:12,560
That says here's a theory of what happens in Wernicke's area.

2091
04:20:12,560 --> 04:20:15,560
Have any of you ever seen one.

2092
04:20:15,560 --> 04:20:18,560
What do those people think about.

2093
04:20:18,560 --> 04:20:22,560
But they'll tell you about.

2094
04:20:22,560 --> 04:20:26,560
I was reading something which said it's going to be very hard to understand these areas.

2095
04:20:26,560 --> 04:20:31,560
Because each neuron is connected to a hundred thousand little fibers.

2096
04:20:31,560 --> 04:20:33,560
Well, some of them are.

2097
04:20:33,560 --> 04:20:38,560
And I bet they don't do much except sort of set the bias for.

2098
04:20:38,560 --> 04:20:40,560
Some large.

2099
04:20:40,560 --> 04:20:42,560
Collection of other neurons.

2100
04:20:42,560 --> 04:20:46,560
But.

2101
04:20:46,560 --> 04:20:50,560
But we if you ask somebody how did you think of such a word.

2102
04:20:50,560 --> 04:20:53,560
They will tell you some story or anecdote.

2103
04:20:53,560 --> 04:20:56,560
But they won't be able to describe some sort of procedure.

2104
04:20:56,560 --> 04:20:58,560
Which is.

2105
04:20:58,560 --> 04:21:01,560
Say in terms of a language like Lisbon.

2106
04:21:01,560 --> 04:21:04,560
Say I const this and that and I took the cutter.

2107
04:21:04,560 --> 04:21:07,560
Of this and the car of that and I.

2108
04:21:07,560 --> 04:21:10,560
Put them in this register and then I.

2109
04:21:10,560 --> 04:21:12,560
Swap that with.

2110
04:21:12,560 --> 04:21:15,560
You don't see theories of how the mind works.

2111
04:21:15,560 --> 04:21:18,560
In psychology today.

2112
04:21:18,560 --> 04:21:21,560
The only parts are they know a little bit about.

2113
04:21:21,560 --> 04:21:24,560
Some aspects of vision because you can track.

2114
04:21:24,560 --> 04:21:27,560
The paths of images from the retina to the.

2115
04:21:27,560 --> 04:21:29,560
What to call to the.

2116
04:21:29,560 --> 04:21:32,560
Primary visual cortex and.

2117
04:21:32,560 --> 04:21:37,560
People have been able to figure out what's what some of those cortical columns do.

2118
04:21:37,560 --> 04:21:39,560
And.

2119
04:21:39,560 --> 04:21:42,560
If you go back to an animal like the frog then.

2120
04:21:42,560 --> 04:21:45,560
Researchers like bitsy and others.

2121
04:21:45,560 --> 04:21:49,560
Have figured out how the equivalent of the cerebellum in the frog.

2122
04:21:49,560 --> 04:21:53,560
They've got almost the whole circuit of how.

2123
04:21:53,560 --> 04:21:55,560
When the frog sees a fly.

2124
04:21:55,560 --> 04:22:01,560
It manages to turn its head that way and stick its tongue out and catch it.

2125
04:22:01,560 --> 04:22:03,560
But in the case of a human.

2126
04:22:03,560 --> 04:22:08,560
I've never seen any theory of how any person thinks of anything.

2127
04:22:08,560 --> 04:22:10,560
So.

2128
04:22:10,560 --> 04:22:14,560
There's artificial intelligence which has high level theories of.

2129
04:22:14,560 --> 04:22:18,560
Semantic representations and there's new neuroscience.

2130
04:22:18,560 --> 04:22:25,560
Which has good theories of local some parts of locomotion and some parts of sensory systems.

2131
04:22:25,560 --> 04:22:27,560
And.

2132
04:22:27,560 --> 04:22:30,560
To this day there's nothing much in between.

2133
04:22:30,560 --> 04:22:32,560
So.

2134
04:22:34,560 --> 04:22:39,560
David here has decided to go from one to the other and.

2135
04:22:39,560 --> 04:22:42,560
Former student of mine Bob her and.

2136
04:22:42,560 --> 04:22:44,560
Has done a little bit on both and.

2137
04:22:44,560 --> 04:22:48,560
I bet there are 20 or 30 people around the country who have.

2138
04:22:48,560 --> 04:22:53,560
Trying to bridge the gap between symbolic artificial intelligence and.

2139
04:22:53,560 --> 04:22:56,560
Mapping of the nervous system.

2140
04:22:56,560 --> 04:22:58,560
But.

2141
04:22:58,560 --> 04:23:00,560
It's very rare and.

2142
04:23:00,560 --> 04:23:06,560
I don't know who you could ask to get support to work on a problem like that for five years.

2143
04:23:06,560 --> 04:23:08,560
Yeah.

2144
04:23:08,560 --> 04:23:12,560
Presumably to build a human like artificial intelligence.

2145
04:23:12,560 --> 04:23:13,560
We need to.

2146
04:23:13,560 --> 04:23:17,560
Like we need to perfectly model our own intelligence which means that.

2147
04:23:17,560 --> 04:23:19,560
We're the system.

2148
04:23:19,560 --> 04:23:22,560
We ourselves are the system that we're trying to understand.

2149
04:23:22,560 --> 04:23:24,560
Well it doesn't have to be exact.

2150
04:23:24,560 --> 04:23:26,560
I mean people are different.

2151
04:23:26,560 --> 04:23:29,560
And.

2152
04:23:29,560 --> 04:23:33,560
Typical person has looks like they have 400.

2153
04:23:33,560 --> 04:23:39,560
Different brain centers doing slightly different things are very different things.

2154
04:23:39,560 --> 04:23:40,560
And.

2155
04:23:40,560 --> 04:23:46,560
We have these examples in many cases if you lose a lot of your brain.

2156
04:23:46,560 --> 04:23:51,560
You're very badly damaged and in other cases.

2157
04:23:51,560 --> 04:23:55,560
You recover and become.

2158
04:23:55,560 --> 04:23:57,560
Just about as smart as you were.

2159
04:23:57,560 --> 04:24:02,560
Probably a few cases where you got rid of something that was holding you back but.

2160
04:24:02,560 --> 04:24:05,560
It's hard to prove that.

2161
04:24:05,560 --> 04:24:07,560
So we don't need to.

2162
04:24:07,560 --> 04:24:09,560
We don't need a theory of.

2163
04:24:09,560 --> 04:24:11,560
How people work yet.

2164
04:24:11,560 --> 04:24:15,560
And the nice thing about AI is that.

2165
04:24:15,560 --> 04:24:17,560
We could get we could.

2166
04:24:17,560 --> 04:24:21,560
Eventually get models which are pretty good at solving.

2167
04:24:21,560 --> 04:24:25,560
What people call everyday common sense problems.

2168
04:24:25,560 --> 04:24:26,560
And.

2169
04:24:26,560 --> 04:24:30,560
Probably in many respects they're not the way the human mind works.

2170
04:24:30,560 --> 04:24:32,560
It doesn't matter.

2171
04:24:32,560 --> 04:24:34,560
But once you've got.

2172
04:24:34,560 --> 04:24:38,560
If I had a program which was pretty good at understanding why you can.

2173
04:24:38,560 --> 04:24:42,560
Pull with a string but not push.

2174
04:24:42,560 --> 04:24:45,560
Then there's a fair chance you could say well.

2175
04:24:45,560 --> 04:24:49,560
That seems to resemble what people do I'll do this.

2176
04:24:49,560 --> 04:24:52,560
A few psychological experiments and see.

2177
04:24:52,560 --> 04:24:56,560
What's wrong with that theory and how to change it.

2178
04:24:56,560 --> 04:24:58,560
So at some point.

2179
04:24:58,560 --> 04:25:01,560
There'll be people making AI systems.

2180
04:25:01,560 --> 04:25:04,560
Comparing them to two particular people.

2181
04:25:04,560 --> 04:25:07,560
And trying to make them fit.

2182
04:25:07,560 --> 04:25:10,560
The trouble is nowadays it takes a few months to.

2183
04:25:10,560 --> 04:25:16,560
If you get a really good new idea to program it.

2184
04:25:16,560 --> 04:25:19,560
I think there's something wrong with programming languages.

2185
04:25:19,560 --> 04:25:22,560
And what we need is a.

2186
04:25:22,560 --> 04:25:25,560
We need a programming language which.

2187
04:25:25,560 --> 04:25:27,560
Where the instructions.

2188
04:25:27,560 --> 04:25:30,560
Describe goals and then sub goals.

2189
04:25:30,560 --> 04:25:34,560
And then finally you might say well let's represent.

2190
04:25:34,560 --> 04:25:37,560
This concept by a number or a semantic.

2191
04:25:37,560 --> 04:25:39,560
Network of some sort.

2192
04:25:39,560 --> 04:25:41,560
But.

2193
04:25:41,560 --> 04:25:42,560
Yes.

2194
04:25:43,560 --> 04:25:45,560
Programming.

2195
04:25:45,560 --> 04:25:47,560
Is there a goal oriented language.

2196
04:25:47,560 --> 04:25:48,560
So.

2197
04:25:48,560 --> 04:25:50,560
There's kind of one if you think about it.

2198
04:25:50,560 --> 04:25:52,560
If you swim hard enough.

2199
04:25:52,560 --> 04:25:54,560
Something like SQL.

2200
04:25:54,560 --> 04:25:57,560
Where you tell him here you know I want to find.

2201
04:25:57,560 --> 04:25:59,560
You know the top 10.

2202
04:25:59,560 --> 04:26:02,560
People like my database with this high value.

2203
04:26:02,560 --> 04:26:06,560
And then you don't worry about how the system goes about doing that.

2204
04:26:06,560 --> 04:26:07,560
In a sense that's.

2205
04:26:07,560 --> 04:26:09,560
We're defining the goal when it goes.

2206
04:26:10,560 --> 04:26:15,560
What's it called.

2207
04:26:15,560 --> 04:26:17,560
SQL.

2208
04:26:21,560 --> 04:26:26,560
Oh right yes I guess database query languages are on the track.

2209
04:26:26,560 --> 04:26:27,560
But.

2210
04:26:27,560 --> 04:26:30,560
Wolfram alpha seems.

2211
04:26:30,560 --> 04:26:32,560
To be better than I thought.

2212
04:26:32,560 --> 04:26:37,560
Well he was running it.

2213
04:26:37,560 --> 04:26:39,560
And he.

2214
04:26:39,560 --> 04:26:43,560
Steve Wolfram was giving this demo a meeting we were at.

2215
04:26:43,560 --> 04:26:45,560
On Monday.

2216
04:26:45,560 --> 04:26:48,560
And he'd say well maybe I'll just say this and.

2217
04:26:48,560 --> 04:26:52,560
And it always worked so.

2218
04:26:52,560 --> 04:26:53,560
So maybe.

2219
04:26:53,560 --> 04:26:56,560
Either the language is better than I thought or.

2220
04:26:56,560 --> 04:27:02,560
Wolfram is better than I thought at something.

2221
04:27:02,560 --> 04:27:04,560
Remarkable guy.

2222
04:27:07,560 --> 04:27:08,560
Yes.

2223
04:27:08,560 --> 04:27:09,560
So.

2224
04:27:09,560 --> 04:27:11,560
I like this example of.

2225
04:27:11,560 --> 04:27:13,560
You only remember a game after your.

2226
04:27:13,560 --> 04:27:17,560
You remember a game after you've given up consciously trying to think about it.

2227
04:27:17,560 --> 04:27:21,560
Do you think this is a matter of us being able to set up background.

2228
04:27:21,560 --> 04:27:22,560
Processes and then.

2229
04:27:22,560 --> 04:27:23,560
Either.

2230
04:27:23,560 --> 04:27:26,560
There's some delay like we give up.

2231
04:27:26,560 --> 04:27:29,560
There's some delay in the process or we don't have the ability to correct me.

2232
04:27:29,560 --> 04:27:30,560
Terminate.

2233
04:27:30,560 --> 04:27:31,560
Processes.

2234
04:27:31,560 --> 04:27:34,560
Do you think this only works for memory or could work for.

2235
04:27:34,560 --> 04:27:35,560
Other things.

2236
04:27:36,560 --> 04:27:37,560
Starting.

2237
04:27:42,560 --> 04:27:46,560
Well there's a lot of nice questions about.

2238
04:27:46,560 --> 04:27:52,560
Things like that how many processes can you run at once in your brain and.

2239
04:27:52,560 --> 04:27:55,560
I was having a sort of argument.

2240
04:27:55,560 --> 04:28:00,560
The other day about.

2241
04:28:00,560 --> 04:28:02,560
Music.

2242
04:28:02,560 --> 04:28:04,560
And.

2243
04:28:05,560 --> 04:28:07,560
I was wondering if.

2244
04:28:07,560 --> 04:28:10,560
I see a big difference between Bach and.

2245
04:28:10,560 --> 04:28:12,560
The.

2246
04:28:12,560 --> 04:28:13,560
And.

2247
04:28:13,560 --> 04:28:16,560
The composers who do counterpoint.

2248
04:28:16,560 --> 04:28:17,560
Counterpoint.

2249
04:28:17,560 --> 04:28:22,560
You usually have several versions of a very similar idea.

2250
04:28:22,560 --> 04:28:24,560
Maybe there's one theme.

2251
04:28:24,560 --> 04:28:25,560
And you.

2252
04:28:25,560 --> 04:28:28,560
Have it playing and then another voice comes in.

2253
04:28:28,560 --> 04:28:32,560
And it has that theme upside down or a variation of it.

2254
04:28:32,560 --> 04:28:34,560
In some cases exactly the same.

2255
04:28:34,560 --> 04:28:37,560
And then it's called a cannon.

2256
04:28:37,560 --> 04:28:38,560
And.

2257
04:28:38,560 --> 04:28:42,560
So the tour de force in classical music.

2258
04:28:42,560 --> 04:28:45,560
Is when you have two or three or four.

2259
04:28:45,560 --> 04:28:48,560
Versions of the same thought going on at.

2260
04:28:48,560 --> 04:28:51,560
Once in different times.

2261
04:28:51,560 --> 04:28:53,560
And my feeling was that in.

2262
04:28:53,560 --> 04:28:57,560
Popular music or red.

2263
04:28:57,560 --> 04:29:00,560
If you take it to a typical band.

2264
04:29:00,560 --> 04:29:01,560
Then.

2265
04:29:01,560 --> 04:29:03,560
There might be four people.

2266
04:29:03,560 --> 04:29:06,560
And they're doing different things at the same time.

2267
04:29:06,560 --> 04:29:09,560
Usually not the same.

2268
04:29:09,560 --> 04:29:10,560
Musical tunes.

2269
04:29:10,560 --> 04:29:14,560
But there's a rhythm and there's.

2270
04:29:14,560 --> 04:29:18,560
A timpani and there's various instruments doing different things.

2271
04:29:18,560 --> 04:29:20,560
But there you don't have several doing the same thing.

2272
04:29:20,560 --> 04:29:24,560
I might might be wrong and.

2273
04:29:24,560 --> 04:29:27,560
Somebody said well some some popular music.

2274
04:29:27,560 --> 04:29:29,560
Has a lot of counterpoint.

2275
04:29:29,560 --> 04:29:31,560
I'm just not familiar with it.

2276
04:29:31,560 --> 04:29:33,560
But I think that's.

2277
04:29:33,560 --> 04:29:36,560
If you're trying to solve a hard problem.

2278
04:29:36,560 --> 04:29:40,560
It's fairly easy to look at the problem in several different ways.

2279
04:29:40,560 --> 04:29:46,560
But what's hard is to look at in several almost the same ways that are slightly different.

2280
04:29:46,560 --> 04:29:48,560
Because probably.

2281
04:29:48,560 --> 04:29:54,560
If you believe that the brain is made of agents or resources or whatever.

2282
04:29:54,560 --> 04:29:57,560
You probably don't have duplicate copies of.

2283
04:29:57,560 --> 04:30:00,560
Ones that do important things because.

2284
04:30:00,560 --> 04:30:03,560
That would take up too much real estate.

2285
04:30:03,560 --> 04:30:06,560
Anyway I might be completely wrong about.

2286
04:30:06,560 --> 04:30:10,560
Jazz somebody.

2287
04:30:10,560 --> 04:30:12,560
Maybe they have.

2288
04:30:12,560 --> 04:30:16,560
Just as complicated overlapping things.

2289
04:30:16,560 --> 04:30:17,560
As.

2290
04:30:17,560 --> 04:30:19,560
Buck and.

2291
04:30:19,560 --> 04:30:25,560
The Contrapuntal Composers did but.

2292
04:30:25,560 --> 04:30:26,560
Yeah.

2293
04:30:26,560 --> 04:30:29,560
What is the ultimate goal of artificial intelligence?

2294
04:30:29,560 --> 04:30:33,560
Is it some sort of application or is it more philosophical?

2295
04:30:33,560 --> 04:30:37,560
Oh everyone has different goals or ones.

2296
04:30:37,560 --> 04:30:40,560
In your opinion.

2297
04:30:40,560 --> 04:30:45,560
I think we're going to need it because.

2298
04:30:45,560 --> 04:30:49,560
The disaster that we're working our way toward is that.

2299
04:30:49,560 --> 04:30:51,560
People are going to live longer.

2300
04:30:51,560 --> 04:30:53,560
And.

2301
04:30:53,560 --> 04:30:55,560
They'll become slightly less able.

2302
04:30:55,560 --> 04:30:57,560
And so you'll have.

2303
04:30:57,560 --> 04:31:02,560
Billions of 200 year old people who can barely get around.

2304
04:31:02,560 --> 04:31:06,560
And there won't be enough.

2305
04:31:06,560 --> 04:31:09,560
People to import from underdeveloped countries.

2306
04:31:09,560 --> 04:31:11,560
To.

2307
04:31:11,560 --> 04:31:13,560
Or they won't be able to afford them.

2308
04:31:13,560 --> 04:31:17,560
So we're going to have to have machines that take care of us.

2309
04:31:17,560 --> 04:31:19,560
Of course that's just a transient because.

2310
04:31:19,560 --> 04:31:22,560
At some point then you'll download your brain into.

2311
04:31:22,560 --> 04:31:25,560
A machine and fix everything that's wrong.

2312
04:31:25,560 --> 04:31:28,560
So we'll need robots for a few hundred years.

2313
04:31:28,560 --> 04:31:30,560
Or a few decades and.

2314
04:31:30,560 --> 04:31:35,560
Then we'll be them and we won't need them anymore.

2315
04:31:35,560 --> 04:31:37,560
But it's an important problem.

2316
04:31:37,560 --> 04:31:41,560
What's going to happen in the next hundred years.

2317
04:31:41,560 --> 04:31:44,560
You're going to have.

2318
04:31:44,560 --> 04:31:48,560
Twenty billion two hundred year olds and nobody to take care of them.

2319
04:31:48,560 --> 04:31:58,560
Unless we get a I.

2320
04:31:58,560 --> 04:32:04,560
Nobody seems particularly sad about that.

2321
04:32:04,560 --> 04:32:06,560
How long.

2322
04:32:06,560 --> 04:32:09,560
Oh another anecdote.

2323
04:32:09,560 --> 04:32:12,560
Because once giving a lecture and.

2324
04:32:12,560 --> 04:32:17,560
Talking about people living a long time.

2325
04:32:17,560 --> 04:32:20,560
And nobody in the audience seemed interested in.

2326
04:32:20,560 --> 04:32:23,560
I'd say well suppose you could live 400 years and.

2327
04:32:23,560 --> 04:32:26,560
Most of the people I then I asked what.

2328
04:32:26,560 --> 04:32:30,560
What was the trouble and said wouldn't it be boring.

2329
04:32:30,560 --> 04:32:33,560
So then I tried it again in a couple of other lectures.

2330
04:32:33,560 --> 04:32:35,560
And.

2331
04:32:35,560 --> 04:32:38,560
If you ask a bunch of scientists.

2332
04:32:38,560 --> 04:32:41,560
How would you like to live 400 years.

2333
04:32:41,560 --> 04:32:45,560
Everyone says yay.

2334
04:32:45,560 --> 04:32:47,560
And you ask them why and they say.

2335
04:32:47,560 --> 04:32:49,560
Well I'm working on a problem that.

2336
04:32:49,560 --> 04:32:52,560
I might not have time to solve but if I.

2337
04:32:52,560 --> 04:32:56,560
If I had 400 years I bet I could get somewhere on it.

2338
04:32:56,560 --> 04:32:59,560
And the other people don't have any goal.

2339
04:32:59,560 --> 04:33:03,560
That's my cold-blooded view of the.

2340
04:33:03,560 --> 04:33:07,560
Typical non-scientist.

2341
04:33:07,560 --> 04:33:11,560
There's nothing for them to do in the long run.

2342
04:33:11,560 --> 04:33:14,560
Who can think of what should people do.

2343
04:33:14,560 --> 04:33:17,560
What's your goal.

2344
04:33:17,560 --> 04:33:20,560
How many of you want to live 400 years.

2345
04:33:20,560 --> 04:33:22,560
Wow.

2346
04:33:22,560 --> 04:33:27,560
Must be scientists here.

2347
04:33:27,560 --> 04:33:31,560
Try it on some crowd and let me know what happens.

2348
04:33:31,560 --> 04:33:34,560
Are people really afraid yeah.

2349
04:33:34,560 --> 04:33:37,560
Differentiating factors whether or not you're.

2350
04:33:37,560 --> 04:33:40,560
400 years it's just going to be the repetition.

2351
04:33:40,560 --> 04:33:43,560
Of 100 years experience or that will start to like.

2352
04:33:43,560 --> 04:33:46,560
Take off.

2353
04:33:46,560 --> 04:33:48,560
Well progress.

2354
04:33:48,560 --> 04:33:50,560
Right.

2355
04:33:50,560 --> 04:33:54,560
I've seen 30.

2356
04:33:54,560 --> 04:33:57,560
Issues of the big bang and I don't look forward to.

2357
04:33:57,560 --> 04:33:59,560
The next one anymore because they're all this.

2358
04:33:59,560 --> 04:34:01,560
They're getting to be all the same.

2359
04:34:01,560 --> 04:34:04,560
Well it's the only thing on TV that has.

2360
04:34:04,560 --> 04:34:11,560
Scientists.

2361
04:34:11,560 --> 04:34:17,560
Seriously I hardly read anything except journals and science fiction.

2362
04:34:17,560 --> 04:34:19,560
Because.

2363
04:34:19,560 --> 04:34:21,560
Yeah.

2364
04:34:22,560 --> 04:34:46,560
I can't think of any advantages except that medicine has.

2365
04:34:46,560 --> 04:34:48,560
Isn't getting.

2366
04:34:48,560 --> 04:34:50,560
The the age of.

2367
04:34:50,560 --> 04:34:52,560
Unhandy cap people.

2368
04:34:52,560 --> 04:34:55,560
Went up at one year every four.

2369
04:34:55,560 --> 04:34:58,560
Since the late 1940s.

2370
04:34:58,560 --> 04:35:00,560
So life span is.

2371
04:35:00,560 --> 04:35:04,560
So that's 60 years so people are living 15 years longer.

2372
04:35:04,560 --> 04:35:07,560
On the average then.

2373
04:35:07,560 --> 04:35:09,560
They did when I was born.

2374
04:35:09,560 --> 04:35:11,560
Or even more than that.

2375
04:35:11,560 --> 04:35:14,560
But it's leveled off lately.

2376
04:35:14,560 --> 04:35:18,560
Now I suspect that you only have to fix a dozen genes or.

2377
04:35:18,560 --> 04:35:20,560
Who knows nobody.

2378
04:35:20,560 --> 04:35:22,560
Really has a good estimate.

2379
04:35:22,560 --> 04:35:25,560
But you can probably double the lifespan if you could.

2380
04:35:25,560 --> 04:35:28,560
Fix.

2381
04:35:28,560 --> 04:35:31,560
Nobody knows but maybe there's just a dozen processes that.

2382
04:35:31,560 --> 04:35:34,560
That would fix a lot of things and.

2383
04:35:34,560 --> 04:35:37,560
Then you could live longer without deteriorating.

2384
04:35:37,560 --> 04:35:39,560
And lots of people might.

2385
04:35:39,560 --> 04:35:41,560
Get bored.

2386
04:35:41,560 --> 04:35:44,560
But.

2387
04:35:44,560 --> 04:35:46,560
They'll self select.

2388
04:35:46,560 --> 04:35:49,560
I don't know.

2389
04:35:49,560 --> 04:35:52,560
What's your answer.

2390
04:35:52,560 --> 04:35:55,560
I.

2391
04:35:55,560 --> 04:35:57,560
I hear that.

2392
04:35:57,560 --> 04:35:59,560
Creating I know that.

2393
04:35:59,560 --> 04:36:03,560
And more.

2394
04:36:03,560 --> 04:36:08,560
I mean the goal is not to help take care of people but to compliment.

2395
04:36:08,560 --> 04:36:11,560
What we already have.

2396
04:36:11,560 --> 04:36:16,560
You could also look at them as our descendants and.

2397
04:36:16,560 --> 04:36:19,560
They we will have them replace us.

2398
04:36:19,560 --> 04:36:22,560
And.

2399
04:36:22,560 --> 04:36:27,560
Just as a lot of people consider their children to be.

2400
04:36:27,560 --> 04:36:30,560
The next generation of them.

2401
04:36:30,560 --> 04:36:33,560
And I know a lot of people who don't.

2402
04:36:33,560 --> 04:36:34,560
So it's.

2403
04:36:34,560 --> 04:36:37,560
It's not a universal.

2404
04:36:37,560 --> 04:36:43,560
But.

2405
04:36:43,560 --> 04:36:50,560
What's the point of anything I don't want to get in.

2406
04:36:50,560 --> 04:36:56,560
We might be the only intelligent life in the universe and.

2407
04:36:56,560 --> 04:36:59,560
In that case it's very important that we.

2408
04:36:59,560 --> 04:37:01,560
Solve all our problems and make sure.

2409
04:37:01,560 --> 04:37:05,560
That something intelligent persists.

2410
04:37:05,560 --> 04:37:11,560
Carl Sagan had some argument of that sort.

2411
04:37:11,560 --> 04:37:14,560
If you were sure that there were lots of others.

2412
04:37:14,560 --> 04:37:15,560
Then.

2413
04:37:15,560 --> 04:37:25,560
Then it wouldn't seem so important.

2414
04:37:25,560 --> 04:37:29,560
Who's the new Carl Sagan.

2415
04:37:29,560 --> 04:37:32,560
Is there any who's the who's the note.

2416
04:37:32,560 --> 04:37:36,560
Is there a public scientist.

2417
04:37:36,560 --> 04:37:40,560
Who.

2418
04:37:40,560 --> 04:37:44,560
All the time.

2419
04:37:44,560 --> 04:37:48,560
Tyson.

2420
04:37:48,560 --> 04:37:50,560
He's very good.

2421
04:37:50,560 --> 04:37:56,560
Tyson is the astrophysicist.

2422
04:37:56,560 --> 04:37:59,560
Brian Green is a great actor.

2423
04:37:59,560 --> 04:38:04,560
Quite impressive.

2424
04:38:04,560 --> 04:38:06,560
Yeah.

2425
04:38:06,560 --> 04:38:27,560
Machine.

2426
04:38:27,560 --> 04:38:30,560
Well I think that's a funny question because.

2427
04:38:30,560 --> 04:38:32,560
If we're programming it.

2428
04:38:32,560 --> 04:38:36,560
We can make sure that the machine has a.

2429
04:38:36,560 --> 04:38:38,560
Very good.

2430
04:38:38,560 --> 04:38:39,560
Abstract.

2431
04:38:39,560 --> 04:38:42,560
But correct model of how it works.

2432
04:38:42,560 --> 04:38:44,560
Which people don't.

2433
04:38:44,560 --> 04:38:46,560
So people have a sense of self.

2434
04:38:46,560 --> 04:38:49,560
But it's only a sense of self and it's.

2435
04:38:49,560 --> 04:38:51,560
It's just plain wrong in almost every.

2436
04:38:51,560 --> 04:38:53,560
Every respect.

2437
04:38:53,560 --> 04:38:55,560
And.

2438
04:38:55,560 --> 04:38:59,560
So it's a really funny question because.

2439
04:38:59,560 --> 04:39:01,560
When you make a machine.

2440
04:39:01,560 --> 04:39:03,560
That really has a.

2441
04:39:03,560 --> 04:39:06,560
Good useful representation of.

2442
04:39:06,560 --> 04:39:08,560
What it is and how it works.

2443
04:39:08,560 --> 04:39:10,560
It might be quite different.

2444
04:39:10,560 --> 04:39:13,560
Have different attitudes than a person does.

2445
04:39:13,560 --> 04:39:17,560
Like it might not consider itself very valuable and say.

2446
04:39:17,560 --> 04:39:22,560
It's a oh I could make something that's even better than me and jump into that.

2447
04:39:22,560 --> 04:39:25,560
And so it wouldn't have the.

2448
04:39:25,560 --> 04:39:28,560
It might not have any self protective.

2449
04:39:28,560 --> 04:39:31,560
Reaction because.

2450
04:39:31,560 --> 04:39:35,560
If you could improve yourself then you don't want not to.

2451
04:39:35,560 --> 04:39:39,560
Whereas we're in a state where there's nothing much we can do except.

2452
04:39:39,560 --> 04:39:42,560
Try to keep living and.

2453
04:39:42,560 --> 04:39:45,560
We don't have any alternative.

2454
04:39:45,560 --> 04:39:46,560
If.

2455
04:39:46,560 --> 04:39:48,560
Stupid.

2456
04:39:48,560 --> 04:39:53,560
Thing to say.

2457
04:39:53,560 --> 04:39:56,560
I can't imagine getting tired of living but.

2458
04:39:56,560 --> 04:40:02,560
Lots of people do.

2459
04:40:02,560 --> 04:40:04,560
Yeah.

2460
04:40:04,560 --> 04:40:07,560
Think about creative thinking and the way of thinking and.

2461
04:40:07,560 --> 04:40:09,560
Where does this.

2462
04:40:09,560 --> 04:40:15,560
I had a little section about that somewhere that I wrote.

2463
04:40:15,560 --> 04:40:23,560
Which was the difference between artists and scientists or engineers and.

2464
04:40:23,560 --> 04:40:25,560
Engineers are in.

2465
04:40:25,560 --> 04:40:28,560
Have a very nice situation because.

2466
04:40:28,560 --> 04:40:30,560
They know what they want.

2467
04:40:30,560 --> 04:40:34,560
Because somebody's ordered them to make a.

2468
04:40:34,560 --> 04:40:39,560
In the last month three times I've walked away.

2469
04:40:39,560 --> 04:40:44,560
From my computer and.

2470
04:40:44,560 --> 04:40:48,560
How many of you have a Mac with the magnetic.

2471
04:40:48,560 --> 04:40:51,560
Thing.

2472
04:40:51,560 --> 04:40:59,560
And three times I pulled it with by tripping on this and it fell to the floor and didn't break.

2473
04:40:59,560 --> 04:41:03,560
And I've had Max for 20 odd years or since 1980.

2474
04:41:03,560 --> 04:41:08,560
When did they start.

2475
04:41:08,560 --> 04:41:12,560
30 years and.

2476
04:41:12,560 --> 04:41:16,560
They used to they have the regular jack power supply in the old days.

2477
04:41:16,560 --> 04:41:21,560
And I don't remember and usually when you pull the cord it comes out.

2478
04:41:21,560 --> 04:41:25,560
Here's this cord that Steve Jobs and everybody designed.

2479
04:41:25,560 --> 04:41:33,560
Very carefully so that when you pull it nothing bad would happen.

2480
04:41:33,560 --> 04:41:37,560
But it does.

2481
04:41:37,560 --> 04:41:40,560
How do you account for that.

2482
04:41:40,560 --> 04:41:45,560
Yeah.

2483
04:41:45,560 --> 04:41:48,560
Yeah.

2484
04:41:48,560 --> 04:41:50,560
Well it's quite a wide angle.

2485
04:41:50,560 --> 04:42:01,560
Yeah.

2486
04:42:01,560 --> 04:42:05,560
Well what it needs is a little ramp so that it would slide out.

2487
04:42:05,560 --> 04:42:11,560
I mean it would only take a minute to file it down so that it would slide out.

2488
04:42:11,560 --> 04:42:14,560
But they didn't.

2489
04:42:14,560 --> 04:42:21,560
I forget why I mentioned that but.

2490
04:42:21,560 --> 04:42:22,560
Right.

2491
04:42:22,560 --> 04:42:24,560
So what's the difference between an artist and engineer.

2492
04:42:24,560 --> 04:42:27,560
Well when you do a painting.

2493
04:42:27,560 --> 04:42:30,560
It seems to me if you're already good at painting.

2494
04:42:30,560 --> 04:42:35,560
The nine tenths of the problem is what should I paint.

2495
04:42:35,560 --> 04:42:38,560
So you can think of an artist as.

2496
04:42:38,560 --> 04:42:44,560
10% skill and 90% trying to figure out what the problem is to solve.

2497
04:42:44,560 --> 04:42:46,560
Whereas for the engineer.

2498
04:42:46,560 --> 04:42:51,560
Somebody's told him what to do make a better cable connector.

2499
04:42:51,560 --> 04:42:56,560
And so he's going to spend 90% of his time actually solving the problem.

2500
04:42:56,560 --> 04:42:59,560
And only 10% of the time.

2501
04:42:59,560 --> 04:43:02,560
Trying to decide what problem to solve.

2502
04:43:02,560 --> 04:43:06,560
So I don't see any difference between artists and engineers.

2503
04:43:06,560 --> 04:43:09,560
Except that.

2504
04:43:09,560 --> 04:43:14,560
The artist has more problems to solve than it could possibly solve.

2505
04:43:14,560 --> 04:43:17,560
And usually ends up by picking a really dumb one.

2506
04:43:17,560 --> 04:43:18,560
Like.

2507
04:43:18,560 --> 04:43:21,560
Let's have a saint in three angels.

2508
04:43:21,560 --> 04:43:25,560
Where will I put the third angel.

2509
04:43:25,560 --> 04:43:31,560
The engineering part.

2510
04:43:31,560 --> 04:43:35,560
Just just improvising.

2511
04:43:35,560 --> 04:43:36,560
So.

2512
04:43:36,560 --> 04:43:39,560
To me the media lab makes sense.

2513
04:43:39,560 --> 04:43:43,560
The artists and were semi artists and the scientists.

2514
04:43:43,560 --> 04:43:46,560
Are doing almost the same thing.

2515
04:43:46,560 --> 04:43:49,560
And if you look at the more arty people.

2516
04:43:49,560 --> 04:43:53,560
They're a little more concerned with human social relations and.

2517
04:43:54,560 --> 04:43:57,560
And others are more concerned with.

2518
04:43:57,560 --> 04:44:01,560
Very technical specific aspects of signal processing or.

2519
04:44:01,560 --> 04:44:04,560
Semantic representations.

2520
04:44:04,560 --> 04:44:05,560
So what.

2521
04:44:05,560 --> 04:44:06,560
But.

2522
04:44:06,560 --> 04:44:08,560
So I don't see much difference.

2523
04:44:08,560 --> 04:44:12,560
Between the arts and the sciences.

2524
04:44:12,560 --> 04:44:14,560
And then.

2525
04:44:14,560 --> 04:44:17,560
Of course the great moments are when you run into.

2526
04:44:17,560 --> 04:44:20,560
People like Leonardo and Michelangelo who.

2527
04:44:21,560 --> 04:44:25,560
Get some idea that requires a great new technical.

2528
04:44:25,560 --> 04:44:26,560
Innovation that.

2529
04:44:26,560 --> 04:44:29,560
Nobody it's ever done and.

2530
04:44:29,560 --> 04:44:31,560
It's hard to separate them.

2531
04:44:31,560 --> 04:44:34,560
I think there's some place where Leonardo.

2532
04:44:34,560 --> 04:44:38,560
Realizes that the lens in the eye would mean.

2533
04:44:38,560 --> 04:44:40,560
That the image is upside down.

2534
04:44:40,560 --> 04:44:43,560
On the retina and he couldn't stand that.

2535
04:44:43,560 --> 04:44:45,560
So there's a diagram he has.

2536
04:44:45,560 --> 04:44:47,560
Where the corny is curved enough.

2537
04:44:47,560 --> 04:44:49,560
To invert the image.

2538
04:44:49,560 --> 04:44:54,560
And then the lens inverts it back again.

2539
04:44:54,560 --> 04:44:58,560
Which is contrary to fact with.

2540
04:44:58,560 --> 04:45:02,560
He has a sketch showing that he was worried about.

2541
04:45:02,560 --> 04:45:03,560
If.

2542
04:45:03,560 --> 04:45:06,560
If the image were upside down on the retina.

2543
04:45:06,560 --> 04:45:08,560
Wouldn't things look upside down.

2544
04:45:08,560 --> 04:45:09,560
But.

2545
04:45:14,560 --> 04:45:16,560
Yeah.

2546
04:45:16,560 --> 04:45:18,560
I don't know if they have a question.

2547
04:45:18,560 --> 04:45:20,560
Did you ever heard of.

2548
04:45:20,560 --> 04:45:22,560
Hiring.

2549
04:45:22,560 --> 04:45:23,560
High air.

2550
04:45:23,560 --> 04:45:25,560
Temporal memory.

2551
04:45:25,560 --> 04:45:27,560
Temporal.

2552
04:45:27,560 --> 04:45:29,560
Temporal memory.

2553
04:45:29,560 --> 04:45:30,560
Like.

2554
04:45:30,560 --> 04:45:32,560
There's a system that I've had.

2555
04:45:32,560 --> 04:45:33,560
Right.

2556
04:45:33,560 --> 04:45:34,560
That's right.

2557
04:45:34,560 --> 04:45:35,560
Great.

2558
04:45:35,560 --> 04:45:36,560
That's right.

2559
04:45:36,560 --> 04:45:37,560
How.

2560
04:45:37,560 --> 04:45:38,560
Great.

2561
04:45:38,560 --> 04:45:40,560
Requires them.

2562
04:45:40,560 --> 04:45:42,560
They have a company called.

2563
04:45:42,560 --> 04:45:44,560
And they're going to release.

2564
04:45:44,560 --> 04:45:46,560
At the end of this year.

2565
04:45:46,560 --> 04:45:47,560
On it.

2566
04:45:47,560 --> 04:45:49,560
And there's like some research.

2567
04:45:49,560 --> 04:45:52,560
They have paper.

2568
04:45:52,560 --> 04:45:55,560
Well, I'm not sure what.

2569
04:45:55,560 --> 04:45:57,560
This is Jeff Hawkins project.

2570
04:45:57,560 --> 04:45:58,560
I don't know.

2571
04:45:58,560 --> 04:46:00,560
Yes.

2572
04:46:00,560 --> 04:46:04,560
I haven't heard about 10 years ago he said Hawkins.

2573
04:46:04,560 --> 04:46:05,560
Yeah.

2574
04:46:05,560 --> 04:46:06,560
Hawkins.

2575
04:46:06,560 --> 04:46:07,560
Yeah.

2576
04:46:07,560 --> 04:46:09,560
Well he was talking about 10 years ago how.

2577
04:46:09,560 --> 04:46:12,560
Great it was and I haven't heard a word of any progress.

2578
04:46:12,560 --> 04:46:15,560
Is there some.

2579
04:46:15,560 --> 04:46:18,560
Anybody heard it.

2580
04:46:18,560 --> 04:46:20,560
There's a couple of books about it but.

2581
04:46:20,560 --> 04:46:25,560
I've never seen any claim of that it works.

2582
04:46:25,560 --> 04:46:29,560
They wrote a ferocious review of the society of mind.

2583
04:46:29,560 --> 04:46:30,560
In.

2584
04:46:30,560 --> 04:46:32,560
Which came out in 1986.

2585
04:46:32,560 --> 04:46:35,560
And.

2586
04:46:35,560 --> 04:46:39,560
The Hawkins group existed then and had this.

2587
04:46:39,560 --> 04:46:44,560
Talk about a hierarchical memory system.

2588
04:46:44,560 --> 04:46:47,560
But.

2589
04:46:47,560 --> 04:46:51,560
So if I can tell it's all bluff nothing happened.

2590
04:46:51,560 --> 04:46:53,560
I've never seen a report.

2591
04:46:53,560 --> 04:46:57,560
That they have a machine which solved the problem.

2592
04:46:57,560 --> 04:46:59,560
Let me know if you find one.

2593
04:46:59,560 --> 04:47:03,560
Because.

2594
04:47:03,560 --> 04:47:06,560
Oh well.

2595
04:47:06,560 --> 04:47:10,560
Hawkins got really mad at me for pointing this out.

2596
04:47:10,560 --> 04:47:12,560
But.

2597
04:47:12,560 --> 04:47:14,560
I was really mad at him for.

2598
04:47:14,560 --> 04:47:15,560
Having four of his.

2599
04:47:15,560 --> 04:47:19,560
Assistants write a bad book review of my book so.

2600
04:47:19,560 --> 04:47:26,560
I hope we were even.

2601
04:47:26,560 --> 04:47:33,560
If anybody can find out whether I forget what it's called you remember its name.

2602
04:47:34,560 --> 04:47:37,560
The game.

2603
04:47:37,560 --> 04:47:42,560
Well let's find out if it can do anything yet.

2604
04:47:42,560 --> 04:47:47,560
Hawkins is wealthy enough to support it for a long time so.

2605
04:47:47,560 --> 04:47:55,560
It should be good by now.

2606
04:47:55,560 --> 04:47:59,560
Yes.

2607
04:47:59,560 --> 04:48:02,560
People first start out with some sort of.

2608
04:48:02,560 --> 04:48:06,560
Classification in their head of the kind of problem it is for.

2609
04:48:06,560 --> 04:48:08,560
Is that not necessary.

2610
04:48:08,560 --> 04:48:10,560
Yes.

2611
04:48:10,560 --> 04:48:12,560
That's.

2612
04:48:12,560 --> 04:48:16,560
Well.

2613
04:48:16,560 --> 04:48:20,560
There's this huge book called human problem solving.

2614
04:48:20,560 --> 04:48:22,560
Which was.

2615
04:48:22,560 --> 04:48:24,560
I don't know how many of you know.

2616
04:48:24,560 --> 04:48:26,560
The names of Newell and Simon.

2617
04:48:26,560 --> 04:48:30,560
Originally was Newell Shaw and Simon.

2618
04:48:30,560 --> 04:48:32,560
And in the.

2619
04:48:32,560 --> 04:48:35,560
Believe it or not in the late 1950s.

2620
04:48:35,560 --> 04:48:37,560
They did some of the first.

2621
04:48:37,560 --> 04:48:41,560
Really productive AI research.

2622
04:48:41,560 --> 04:48:43,560
And.

2623
04:48:43,560 --> 04:48:45,560
Then I think.

2624
04:48:45,560 --> 04:48:47,560
In 1970.

2625
04:48:47,560 --> 04:48:49,560
So that's.

2626
04:48:49,560 --> 04:48:53,560
After 12 years of.

2627
04:48:53,560 --> 04:48:56,560
Discovering interesting things.

2628
04:48:56,560 --> 04:48:58,560
Their main discovery was.

2629
04:48:58,560 --> 04:49:01,560
The gadget that they called GPS.

2630
04:49:01,560 --> 04:49:04,560
Which is not global positioning satellite but.

2631
04:49:04,560 --> 04:49:07,560
General problem solver.

2632
04:49:07,560 --> 04:49:09,560
And.

2633
04:49:09,560 --> 04:49:11,560
You can look it up in the index.

2634
04:49:11,560 --> 04:49:13,560
Of my book and there's a sort of.

2635
04:49:13,560 --> 04:49:16,560
One or two page description.

2636
04:49:16,560 --> 04:49:19,560
If you ever get some spare time.

2637
04:49:19,560 --> 04:49:21,560
Search the web for their early.

2638
04:49:21,560 --> 04:49:24,560
Early paper by Newell and Simon on.

2639
04:49:24,560 --> 04:49:27,560
How GPS worked because it's really fascinating.

2640
04:49:27,560 --> 04:49:31,560
What it did is it looked at a problem and found some features of it.

2641
04:49:31,560 --> 04:49:35,560
And then looked up in a table saying that.

2642
04:49:35,560 --> 04:49:39,560
If there's this difference between what you have and what you.

2643
04:49:39,560 --> 04:49:40,560
Want.

2644
04:49:40,560 --> 04:49:42,560
Use such and such a method.

2645
04:49:42,560 --> 04:49:44,560
So it was so what I called it.

2646
04:49:44,560 --> 04:49:46,560
We named it a difference engine.

2647
04:49:46,560 --> 04:49:48,560
As a sort of joke.

2648
04:49:48,560 --> 04:49:50,560
Because the first computer.

2649
04:49:50,560 --> 04:49:53,560
In history was.

2650
04:49:53,560 --> 04:49:56,560
The one called the difference engine but.

2651
04:49:56,560 --> 04:49:58,560
It was for.

2652
04:49:58,560 --> 04:50:00,560
Predicting tides and things.

2653
04:50:00,560 --> 04:50:01,560
Anyway.

2654
04:50:01,560 --> 04:50:03,560
They did some beautiful work.

2655
04:50:03,560 --> 04:50:05,560
And there's this big book.

2656
04:50:05,560 --> 04:50:07,560
Which I think is about 1970.

2657
04:50:07,560 --> 04:50:09,560
Called human problem solving.

2658
04:50:09,560 --> 04:50:11,560
And.

2659
04:50:11,560 --> 04:50:13,560
What they did is.

2660
04:50:13,560 --> 04:50:15,560
Got some people to solve problems.

2661
04:50:15,560 --> 04:50:19,560
And they trained the people to talk while they're solving the problem.

2662
04:50:19,560 --> 04:50:26,560
So some of them were little cryptograms like.

2663
04:50:26,560 --> 04:50:30,560
If each letter stands for.

2664
04:50:30,560 --> 04:50:34,560
For a digit.

2665
04:50:34,560 --> 04:50:37,560
I've forgotten it.

2666
04:50:37,560 --> 04:50:41,560
Pat, do you remember the name one of those problems.

2667
04:50:41,560 --> 04:50:44,560
John plus Joe.

2668
04:50:44,560 --> 04:50:48,560
John plus Jane equals Robert or something.

2669
04:50:48,560 --> 04:50:51,560
That I'm sure that has no solution.

2670
04:50:51,560 --> 04:50:54,560
But those are called crypt arithmetic.

2671
04:50:54,560 --> 04:50:58,560
And so they had dozens or hundreds of people.

2672
04:50:58,560 --> 04:51:02,560
Who would be trained to talk aloud while they're solving.

2673
04:51:02,560 --> 04:51:04,560
Little puzzles like that.

2674
04:51:04,560 --> 04:51:05,560
And then.

2675
04:51:05,560 --> 04:51:07,560
What they did was.

2676
04:51:07,560 --> 04:51:11,560
Get exactly what the people said and how long they took and.

2677
04:51:11,560 --> 04:51:14,560
In some cases where they moved their eyes.

2678
04:51:14,560 --> 04:51:16,560
They had an eye tracking machine.

2679
04:51:16,560 --> 04:51:18,560
And then they wrote programs.

2680
04:51:18,560 --> 04:51:24,560
That showed how this guy solved a couple of these crypt arithmetic problems.

2681
04:51:24,560 --> 04:51:26,560
Then they ran the program on a new one.

2682
04:51:26,560 --> 04:51:30,560
And in some rare cases it actually solved the.

2683
04:51:30,560 --> 04:51:33,560
The other problem so this is a book.

2684
04:51:33,560 --> 04:51:35,560
Which.

2685
04:51:35,560 --> 04:51:39,560
Looks at human behavior and makes a theory of what it's doing.

2686
04:51:39,560 --> 04:51:41,560
And the output is a rule based system.

2687
04:51:41,560 --> 04:51:43,560
So it's.

2688
04:51:43,560 --> 04:51:45,560
It's not a very exciting theory, but.

2689
04:51:45,560 --> 04:51:47,560
But.

2690
04:51:47,560 --> 04:51:50,560
There had never been anything like it.

2691
04:51:50,560 --> 04:51:51,560
Inside.

2692
04:51:51,560 --> 04:51:56,560
You know, it was like Pavlov discovering conditioned reflexes for rats.

2693
04:51:56,560 --> 04:51:57,560
Or dogs.

2694
04:51:57,560 --> 04:51:59,560
And Newland Simon.

2695
04:51:59,560 --> 04:52:01,560
Discovering some.

2696
04:52:01,560 --> 04:52:04,560
Rather higher level.

2697
04:52:05,560 --> 04:52:07,560
Almost a Rodney Brooks like system.

2698
04:52:07,560 --> 04:52:12,560
For how humans solve some problems that most people find pretty hard.

2699
04:52:12,560 --> 04:52:13,560
See.

2700
04:52:13,560 --> 04:52:15,560
Anyway.

2701
04:52:21,560 --> 04:52:24,560
What there hasn't been as much.

2702
04:52:24,560 --> 04:52:27,560
I don't know of any follow up they spent years.

2703
04:52:27,560 --> 04:52:30,560
Perfecting those experiments and.

2704
04:52:30,560 --> 04:52:32,560
Writing about.

2705
04:52:32,560 --> 04:52:34,560
Results.

2706
04:52:34,560 --> 04:52:36,560
And.

2707
04:52:38,560 --> 04:52:40,560
Anybody know anything like that.

2708
04:52:40,560 --> 04:52:44,560
What psychology is to try to make.

2709
04:52:44,560 --> 04:52:48,560
Real models of real people solving.

2710
04:52:48,560 --> 04:52:50,560
Point problems.

2711
04:52:53,560 --> 04:52:55,560
My.

2712
04:53:01,560 --> 04:53:04,560
It has a green light.

2713
04:53:04,560 --> 04:53:07,560
It has a green light, but the switch was up.

2714
04:53:07,560 --> 04:53:09,560
Boo.

2715
04:53:09,560 --> 04:53:12,560
Oh, it doesn't.

2716
04:53:12,560 --> 04:53:14,560
Yes.

2717
04:53:14,560 --> 04:53:16,560
Did that study.

2718
04:53:16,560 --> 04:53:17,560
Try and see when.

2719
04:53:17,560 --> 04:53:20,560
A person gave up on a particular problem solving method.

2720
04:53:20,560 --> 04:53:24,560
How they switched another which one is which to based on.

2721
04:53:24,560 --> 04:53:27,560
It has it has inexplicable.

2722
04:53:27,560 --> 04:53:28,560
Points at which.

2723
04:53:29,560 --> 04:53:32,560
The person suddenly gives up on that representation.

2724
04:53:32,560 --> 04:53:35,560
And he says, oh, well, I guess.

2725
04:53:35,560 --> 04:53:38,560
I guess are must be three.

2726
04:53:41,560 --> 04:53:44,560
Did I erase well.

2727
04:53:44,560 --> 04:53:46,560
Yes, it's got episodes.

2728
04:53:46,560 --> 04:53:49,560
And they can't account for the.

2729
04:53:49,560 --> 04:53:51,560
These little jerks in the script.

2730
04:53:51,560 --> 04:53:54,560
Where the model changes.

2731
04:53:54,560 --> 04:53:56,560
And.

2732
04:53:56,560 --> 04:53:58,560
Sorry.

2733
04:53:58,560 --> 04:54:01,560
And they announced those to be mysteries.

2734
04:54:01,560 --> 04:54:03,560
And say, here's a place where the.

2735
04:54:03,560 --> 04:54:06,560
Person has decided the strategy isn't working.

2736
04:54:06,560 --> 04:54:11,560
And starts over or is changing something.

2737
04:54:11,560 --> 04:54:14,560
The amazing part is that their model.

2738
04:54:14,560 --> 04:54:17,560
Sometimes fits what the person says.

2739
04:54:17,560 --> 04:54:20,560
For 50 or even 100 steps.

2740
04:54:20,560 --> 04:54:23,560
The guy saying, oh, I think two must be.

2741
04:54:23,560 --> 04:54:27,560
Z must be two and P must be seven.

2742
04:54:27,560 --> 04:54:30,560
And that means he plus he is nine.

2743
04:54:30,560 --> 04:54:32,560
And I wonder what's nine.

2744
04:54:32,560 --> 04:54:34,560
And.

2745
04:54:34,560 --> 04:54:38,560
So their model fits for very long.

2746
04:54:38,560 --> 04:54:43,560
Strings maybe two minutes of the person mumbling.

2747
04:54:43,560 --> 04:54:45,560
To themselves.

2748
04:54:45,560 --> 04:54:47,560
And then.

2749
04:54:47,560 --> 04:54:48,560
It breaks and then.

2750
04:54:48,560 --> 04:54:51,560
Is another sequence.

2751
04:54:51,560 --> 04:54:54,560
So new will actually spent.

2752
04:54:54,560 --> 04:55:00,560
More than a year after doing it verbally.

2753
04:55:00,560 --> 04:55:03,560
At tracking the person's eye motions.

2754
04:55:03,560 --> 04:55:07,560
And trying to correlate the person's eye motions with.

2755
04:55:07,560 --> 04:55:10,560
What the person was talking about.

2756
04:55:10,560 --> 04:55:12,560
And guess what.

2757
04:55:12,560 --> 04:55:15,560
None.

2758
04:55:15,560 --> 04:55:17,560
It was almost as though.

2759
04:55:17,560 --> 04:55:19,560
You look at something.

2760
04:55:19,560 --> 04:55:22,560
And then to think about it, you look away.

2761
04:55:22,560 --> 04:55:25,560
It was a.

2762
04:55:25,560 --> 04:55:27,560
Newell was quite distressed because.

2763
04:55:27,560 --> 04:55:29,560
He spent about a year.

2764
04:55:29,560 --> 04:55:32,560
Crawling over this data trying to.

2765
04:55:32,560 --> 04:55:36,560
Figure out what kinds of mental events caused the eyes to.

2766
04:55:36,560 --> 04:55:38,560
Change what they were looking at.

2767
04:55:38,560 --> 04:55:42,560
But when the problem got hard, you would look at a blank part of the thing more.

2768
04:55:42,560 --> 04:55:44,560
More often than.

2769
04:55:44,560 --> 04:55:46,560
The place where the problem.

2770
04:55:46,560 --> 04:55:48,560
Turned up.

2771
04:55:48,560 --> 04:55:51,560
So conclusion.

2772
04:55:51,560 --> 04:55:54,560
That didn't work.

2773
04:55:54,560 --> 04:55:57,560
When I was a very young.

2774
04:55:57,560 --> 04:56:00,560
Student in college I had a.

2775
04:56:00,560 --> 04:56:03,560
Friend named Marcus Singer who.

2776
04:56:03,560 --> 04:56:06,560
Was trying to figure out how the.

2777
04:56:06,560 --> 04:56:10,560
Nerve in the four limb of a frog worked.

2778
04:56:10,560 --> 04:56:15,560
And so he was operating on tadpoles and.

2779
04:56:16,560 --> 04:56:18,560
He spent about six weeks.

2780
04:56:18,560 --> 04:56:21,560
Moving this sciatic nerve.

2781
04:56:21,560 --> 04:56:24,560
From the leg up to the arm.

2782
04:56:24,560 --> 04:56:26,560
Of this tadpole.

2783
04:56:26,560 --> 04:56:33,560
And then they all got some fungus and died.

2784
04:56:33,560 --> 04:56:37,560
So I said what are you going to do and he said well.

2785
04:56:37,560 --> 04:56:40,560
I guess I'll have to do it again.

2786
04:56:40,560 --> 04:56:43,560
I switch from biology to mathematics.

2787
04:56:53,560 --> 04:56:56,560
But in fact he discovered the.

2788
04:56:56,560 --> 04:56:58,560
Growth hormone that.

2789
04:56:58,560 --> 04:57:01,560
He thought came from the nerve and made that.

2790
04:57:01,560 --> 04:57:04,560
If you cut off the limb but of a tadpole.

2791
04:57:04,560 --> 04:57:08,560
It'll grow another one and grow a whole.

2792
04:57:08,560 --> 04:57:11,560
It was a nude I'm sorry it's salamander.

2793
04:57:11,560 --> 04:57:14,560
It'll grow a new hand.

2794
04:57:14,560 --> 04:57:16,560
If you wait till it's got a.

2795
04:57:16,560 --> 04:57:19,560
Substantial hand it won't grow a new one.

2796
04:57:19,560 --> 04:57:21,560
But he discovered the hormone that.

2797
04:57:21,560 --> 04:57:23,560
Makes it do that.

2798
04:57:23,560 --> 04:57:25,560
Yeah.

2799
04:57:25,560 --> 04:57:27,560
Questions from the homework that.

2800
04:57:27,560 --> 04:57:30,560
Relates to the problem solving.

2801
04:57:30,560 --> 04:57:33,560
A common theme is having multiple ways to react to the same problem.

2802
04:57:34,560 --> 04:57:36,560
Which.

2803
04:57:39,560 --> 04:57:42,560
So we have a whole lot of if thens and we have to.

2804
04:57:42,560 --> 04:57:45,560
Choose which if.

2805
04:57:45,560 --> 04:57:51,560
I don't think I have a good theory of that.

2806
04:57:51,560 --> 04:57:54,560
Yes if you have a huge rule based system and they're.

2807
04:57:54,560 --> 04:57:58,560
What does Randy Davis do.

2808
04:57:58,560 --> 04:58:00,560
What if you have a rule based system and.

2809
04:58:01,560 --> 04:58:03,560
A whole lot of rules fit.

2810
04:58:03,560 --> 04:58:06,560
Ifs fit the condition.

2811
04:58:06,560 --> 04:58:09,560
Do you just take the one that's most often worked.

2812
04:58:09,560 --> 04:58:11,560
Or.

2813
04:58:11,560 --> 04:58:15,560
If nothing seems to be working do you.

2814
04:58:15,560 --> 04:58:22,560
You certainly don't want to keep trying the same one.

2815
04:58:22,560 --> 04:58:25,560
I think I mentioned Doug Lenet's rule.

2816
04:58:25,560 --> 04:58:28,560
Some people will assign probabilities to things.

2817
04:58:29,560 --> 04:58:31,560
To behaviors.

2818
04:58:31,560 --> 04:58:33,560
And then pick.

2819
04:58:33,560 --> 04:58:37,560
The way to react in proportional to the probability that.

2820
04:58:37,560 --> 04:58:39,560
That thing has worked in the past.

2821
04:58:39,560 --> 04:58:42,560
And Doug Lenette.

2822
04:58:42,560 --> 04:58:46,560
Thought of doing that but instead he just put the things in a list.

2823
04:58:46,560 --> 04:58:48,560
And whenever a hypothesis.

2824
04:58:48,560 --> 04:58:50,560
Worked better than another one.

2825
04:58:50,560 --> 04:58:52,560
He would raise it.

2826
04:58:52,560 --> 04:58:55,560
Push it toward the front of the list.

2827
04:58:55,560 --> 04:58:59,560
And then whenever there was a choice it would pick.

2828
04:58:59,560 --> 04:59:03,560
If all the rules that fit it would pick the one at the top of the list.

2829
04:59:03,560 --> 04:59:06,560
And if that didn't work it would get demoted.

2830
04:59:06,560 --> 04:59:09,560
So.

2831
04:59:09,560 --> 04:59:12,560
That's when I became an anti probability.

2832
04:59:12,560 --> 04:59:14,560
Person.

2833
04:59:14,560 --> 04:59:15,560
That is.

2834
04:59:15,560 --> 04:59:20,560
If just sorting the things on the list worked pretty well.

2835
04:59:20,560 --> 04:59:24,560
Our probabilities going to do much better.

2836
04:59:24,560 --> 04:59:25,560
No.

2837
04:59:25,560 --> 04:59:28,560
Because if you do probability matching.

2838
04:59:28,560 --> 04:59:32,560
You're worse off then.

2839
04:59:32,560 --> 04:59:36,560
Then what.

2840
04:59:36,560 --> 04:59:39,560
Ray Solomon off discovered that.

2841
04:59:39,560 --> 04:59:41,560
If you have.

2842
04:59:41,560 --> 04:59:46,560
A set of probabilities that something will work.

2843
04:59:46,560 --> 04:59:48,560
And you have no memory.

2844
04:59:48,560 --> 04:59:51,560
So that each time you comments.

2845
04:59:52,560 --> 04:59:54,560
Try the.

2846
04:59:54,560 --> 04:59:57,560
I think I mentioned that the other day but.

2847
04:59:57,560 --> 04:59:59,560
It's worth emphasizing because.

2848
04:59:59,560 --> 05:00:05,560
Nobody in the world seems to know it.

2849
05:00:05,560 --> 05:00:08,560
Suppose you have a list of things.

2850
05:00:08,560 --> 05:00:09,560
He.

2851
05:00:09,560 --> 05:00:11,560
Equals this.

2852
05:00:11,560 --> 05:00:12,560
Or that.

2853
05:00:12,560 --> 05:00:15,560
Or that.

2854
05:00:15,560 --> 05:00:18,560
And.

2855
05:00:18,560 --> 05:00:21,560
In other words suppose is a hundred boxes here.

2856
05:00:21,560 --> 05:00:23,560
And.

2857
05:00:23,560 --> 05:00:25,560
One of them has a.

2858
05:00:25,560 --> 05:00:28,560
Gold brick in it.

2859
05:00:28,560 --> 05:00:31,560
And the others don't.

2860
05:00:31,560 --> 05:00:33,560
And so for each box.

2861
05:00:33,560 --> 05:00:35,560
Suppose the probability is.

2862
05:00:35,560 --> 05:00:38,560
Point nine.

2863
05:00:38,560 --> 05:00:41,560
That this one has the gold brick.

2864
05:00:41,560 --> 05:00:42,560
And.

2865
05:00:42,560 --> 05:00:45,560
This one has point oh one.

2866
05:00:46,560 --> 05:00:50,560
And this has point oh one.

2867
05:00:50,560 --> 05:00:52,560
Let's see how many of them.

2868
05:00:52,560 --> 05:00:54,560
So there's ten of these.

2869
05:00:54,560 --> 05:01:02,560
That makes.

2870
05:01:02,560 --> 05:01:07,560
Now what should you do suppose you're allowed to.

2871
05:01:07,560 --> 05:01:09,560
Keep choosing a box.

2872
05:01:09,560 --> 05:01:10,560
And.

2873
05:01:10,560 --> 05:01:14,560
You want to get your gold brick as soon as possible.

2874
05:01:14,560 --> 05:01:16,560
What's the smart thing to do.

2875
05:01:16,560 --> 05:01:17,560
Should you.

2876
05:01:17,560 --> 05:01:23,560
But you have no memory.

2877
05:01:23,560 --> 05:01:25,560
Maybe the gold brick is decreasing in value.

2878
05:01:25,560 --> 05:01:26,560
I don't care.

2879
05:01:26,560 --> 05:01:27,560
But.

2880
05:01:27,560 --> 05:01:32,560
So should you keep trying point nine.

2881
05:01:32,560 --> 05:01:34,560
If you have no memory.

2882
05:01:34,560 --> 05:01:36,560
Of course not.

2883
05:01:36,560 --> 05:01:41,560
Because if you don't get it the first time you'll never get it.

2884
05:01:41,560 --> 05:01:44,560
If you tried them at random.

2885
05:01:44,560 --> 05:01:45,560
Each time.

2886
05:01:45,560 --> 05:01:48,560
Then you'd have point nine chance of getting it.

2887
05:01:48,560 --> 05:01:49,560
So in.

2888
05:01:49,560 --> 05:01:51,560
In two trials.

2889
05:01:51,560 --> 05:01:53,560
You'd have.

2890
05:01:53,560 --> 05:01:54,560
What am I saying.

2891
05:01:54,560 --> 05:01:55,560
In a hundred trials.

2892
05:01:55,560 --> 05:01:57,560
You're pretty sure to get it.

2893
05:01:57,560 --> 05:01:58,560
But.

2894
05:01:58,560 --> 05:02:03,560
In a hundred trials.

2895
05:02:03,560 --> 05:02:05,560
Almost certain.

2896
05:02:05,560 --> 05:02:07,560
So if you don't have any memory.

2897
05:02:07,560 --> 05:02:11,560
Then probability matching is not a good idea.

2898
05:02:11,560 --> 05:02:14,560
Certainly picking the highest probability.

2899
05:02:14,560 --> 05:02:16,560
Is not a good idea.

2900
05:02:16,560 --> 05:02:17,560
Because.

2901
05:02:17,560 --> 05:02:21,560
If you don't get it the first trial you'll never get it.

2902
05:02:21,560 --> 05:02:25,560
If you keep using the probabilities.

2903
05:02:25,560 --> 05:02:26,560
At.

2904
05:02:26,560 --> 05:02:28,560
What am I saying.

2905
05:02:28,560 --> 05:02:31,560
Anyway what do you think is the best thing to do.

2906
05:02:31,560 --> 05:02:35,560
It's to take the square roots of those probabilities.

2907
05:02:35,560 --> 05:02:38,560
And then divide them by the sum of the square roots.

2908
05:02:38,560 --> 05:02:42,560
So it adds up to one.

2909
05:02:42,560 --> 05:02:44,560
So a lot of psychologists.

2910
05:02:44,560 --> 05:02:47,560
Design experiments until they get the rat.

2911
05:02:47,560 --> 05:02:50,560
To match the probability.

2912
05:02:50,560 --> 05:02:52,560
And then they publish it.

2913
05:02:52,560 --> 05:02:58,560
Sort of like the.

2914
05:02:58,560 --> 05:03:02,560
But if the animal is optimal and doesn't have much memory.

2915
05:03:02,560 --> 05:03:05,560
It shouldn't match the probability of the unknown.

2916
05:03:05,560 --> 05:03:08,560
It should.

2917
05:03:08,560 --> 05:03:14,560
End of story.

2918
05:03:14,560 --> 05:03:17,560
Every now and then I search.

2919
05:03:17,560 --> 05:03:19,560
Every few years.

2920
05:03:19,560 --> 05:03:24,560
To see if anybody has noticed this thing which.

2921
05:03:24,560 --> 05:03:39,560
And I've never found it on the web.

2922
05:03:39,560 --> 05:03:40,560
Yeah.

2923
05:03:40,560 --> 05:03:55,560
So earlier in the course.

2924
05:03:55,560 --> 05:03:58,560
I didn't don't mean to say they don't work.

2925
05:03:58,560 --> 05:04:00,560
Rule based methods are great.

2926
05:04:00,560 --> 05:04:03,560
For some kinds of problems so.

2927
05:04:03,560 --> 05:04:07,560
Most.

2928
05:04:07,560 --> 05:04:10,560
Most systems make money and.

2929
05:04:10,560 --> 05:04:11,560
You know if.

2930
05:04:11,560 --> 05:04:15,560
If you're trying to.

2931
05:04:15,560 --> 05:04:22,560
Make hotel reservations and things.

2932
05:04:22,560 --> 05:04:26,560
This business of rule based systems.

2933
05:04:26,560 --> 05:04:27,560
It has a nice history.

2934
05:04:27,560 --> 05:04:30,560
A couple of AI researchers really.

2935
05:04:30,560 --> 05:04:32,560
Notably Ed Feigenbaum.

2936
05:04:32,560 --> 05:04:34,560
Who was a.

2937
05:04:34,560 --> 05:04:38,560
Student of Newell and Simon.

2938
05:04:38,560 --> 05:04:44,560
Started a company for making rule based systems.

2939
05:04:44,560 --> 05:04:45,560
And.

2940
05:04:45,560 --> 05:04:48,560
Company did pretty well for a while.

2941
05:04:48,560 --> 05:04:50,560
Until.

2942
05:04:50,560 --> 05:04:52,560
And they maintained that.

2943
05:04:52,560 --> 05:04:55,560
Only an expert in artificial intelligence.

2944
05:04:55,560 --> 05:04:58,560
Could be really good at making rule based systems.

2945
05:04:58,560 --> 05:05:00,560
And so they had a lot of customers and.

2946
05:05:00,560 --> 05:05:04,560
Quite a bit of success for a year or two.

2947
05:05:04,560 --> 05:05:07,560
And then some people at Arthur D little.

2948
05:05:07,560 --> 05:05:09,560
Said oh we can do that and.

2949
05:05:09,560 --> 05:05:12,560
They made some systems that worked fine.

2950
05:05:12,560 --> 05:05:15,560
And.

2951
05:05:15,560 --> 05:05:17,560
The market disappeared.

2952
05:05:17,560 --> 05:05:18,560
Because it turned out that.

2953
05:05:18,560 --> 05:05:20,560
You didn't have to be.

2954
05:05:20,560 --> 05:05:22,560
Good at anything in particular.

2955
05:05:22,560 --> 05:05:27,560
To make rule based systems work.

2956
05:05:27,560 --> 05:05:28,560
But.

2957
05:05:28,560 --> 05:05:30,560
For doing.

2958
05:05:30,560 --> 05:05:36,560
Harder problems like translating from one language to another.

2959
05:05:36,560 --> 05:05:39,560
You really needed to have more structure and.

2960
05:05:39,560 --> 05:05:42,560
You couldn't just take the probabilities of.

2961
05:05:42,560 --> 05:05:44,560
Words being in a sentence that you.

2962
05:05:44,560 --> 05:05:48,560
Had to look for diagrams and trigrams and.

2963
05:05:48,560 --> 05:05:55,560
Have some grammar theory and so forth so.

2964
05:05:55,560 --> 05:05:59,560
But generally if you have a.

2965
05:05:59,560 --> 05:06:03,560
Ordinary data processing problem.

2966
05:06:03,560 --> 05:06:07,560
Try rule based system first because.

2967
05:06:07,560 --> 05:06:11,560
If you understand what's going on good chance you'll.

2968
05:06:11,560 --> 05:06:20,560
Get things to work I'm sure that's what the.

2969
05:06:20,560 --> 05:06:22,560
Hawkins.

2970
05:06:22,560 --> 05:06:30,560
Thing started out as.

2971
05:06:30,560 --> 05:06:50,560
I don't have any questions.

2972
05:06:51,560 --> 05:06:56,560
Sure.

2973
05:06:56,560 --> 05:07:00,560
Machines use relatively few electronic components to run a.

2974
05:07:00,560 --> 05:07:02,560
Different type of thought operations.

2975
05:07:02,560 --> 05:07:05,560
All that changes is data over which the operation runs.

2976
05:07:05,560 --> 05:07:08,560
In the critic selector model resources different.

2977
05:07:08,560 --> 05:07:10,560
Of data with different physical parts to bring.

2978
05:07:10,560 --> 05:07:12,560
Which model.

2979
05:07:12,560 --> 05:07:14,560
Critics left.

2980
05:07:14,560 --> 05:07:19,560
Oh actually.

2981
05:07:20,560 --> 05:07:29,560
I've never seen a.

2982
05:07:29,560 --> 05:07:34,560
I've never seen a large scale theory of how the brain.

2983
05:07:34,560 --> 05:07:37,560
Connects it's.

2984
05:07:37,560 --> 05:07:41,560
There doesn't seem to be a global model anywhere.

2985
05:07:41,560 --> 05:07:43,560
Anybody.

2986
05:07:43,560 --> 05:07:45,560
Read any.

2987
05:07:45,560 --> 05:07:50,560
Of science books lately.

2988
05:07:50,560 --> 05:07:54,560
I mean.

2989
05:07:54,560 --> 05:07:57,560
I just don't know of any.

2990
05:07:57,560 --> 05:08:03,560
Any big diagrams.

2991
05:08:03,560 --> 05:08:10,560
Here's this wonderful behavioral diagram so.

2992
05:08:10,560 --> 05:08:16,560
How many of you have run across the word ethology.

2993
05:08:16,560 --> 05:08:18,560
Just a few.

2994
05:08:18,560 --> 05:08:20,560
There's a branch of.

2995
05:08:20,560 --> 05:08:23,560
The psychology of animals.

2996
05:08:23,560 --> 05:08:27,560
Which is.

2997
05:08:27,560 --> 05:08:29,560
Thanks.

2998
05:08:29,560 --> 05:08:32,560
Which is called ethology.

2999
05:08:32,560 --> 05:08:38,560
And it's the study of instinctive behavior.

3000
05:08:38,560 --> 05:08:40,560
So these.

3001
05:08:40,560 --> 05:08:45,560
And the most famous people in that field.

3002
05:08:45,560 --> 05:08:47,560
Who.

3003
05:08:47,560 --> 05:08:51,560
Well Tim Bergen Nico Tim Bergen and Conrad Lorenz.

3004
05:08:51,560 --> 05:08:53,560
Are the most famous.

3005
05:08:53,560 --> 05:08:57,560
I've just lost the name of the.

3006
05:08:57,560 --> 05:09:00,560
Guy around the 1900.

3007
05:09:00,560 --> 05:09:02,560
Who wrote.

3008
05:09:02,560 --> 05:09:05,560
A lot about the behavior of ants.

3009
05:09:05,560 --> 05:09:07,560
Anybody.

3010
05:09:07,560 --> 05:09:09,560
Ring a bell.

3011
05:09:09,560 --> 05:09:12,560
So he was the sort of the first ethologist.

3012
05:09:12,560 --> 05:09:16,560
And these people don't study learning because it's hard to.

3013
05:09:16,560 --> 05:09:18,560
I don't know why.

3014
05:09:18,560 --> 05:09:19,560
But.

3015
05:09:19,560 --> 05:09:22,560
So they're studying instinctive behavior which is.

3016
05:09:22,560 --> 05:09:25,560
What are the things that all fish do.

3017
05:09:25,560 --> 05:09:27,560
Of a certain species.

3018
05:09:27,560 --> 05:09:29,560
And.

3019
05:09:29,560 --> 05:09:33,560
You get these big diagrams.

3020
05:09:33,560 --> 05:09:43,560
And.

3021
05:09:43,560 --> 05:09:46,560
This is from a little book.

3022
05:09:46,560 --> 05:09:48,560
Which you really should read.

3023
05:09:48,560 --> 05:09:51,560
Called the study of instinct.

3024
05:09:52,560 --> 05:10:05,560
And.

3025
05:10:05,560 --> 05:10:07,560
It's a beautiful book.

3026
05:10:07,560 --> 05:10:10,560
And if that's not enough.

3027
05:10:10,560 --> 05:10:13,560
Then there's a two volume.

3028
05:10:13,560 --> 05:10:16,560
Similar book by Conrad Lorenz.

3029
05:10:16,560 --> 05:10:18,560
Who.

3030
05:10:18,560 --> 05:10:19,560
Was.

3031
05:10:19,560 --> 05:10:22,560
Austrian researcher.

3032
05:10:22,560 --> 05:10:24,560
They report.

3033
05:10:24,560 --> 05:10:26,560
They did a lot of stuff together.

3034
05:10:26,560 --> 05:10:27,560
These two.

3035
05:10:27,560 --> 05:10:28,560
People.

3036
05:10:28,560 --> 05:10:30,560
And it's full of.

3037
05:10:30,560 --> 05:10:32,560
Diagrams showing.

3038
05:10:32,560 --> 05:10:34,560
The.

3039
05:10:34,560 --> 05:10:37,560
Main behaviors that they were able to observe.

3040
05:10:37,560 --> 05:10:39,560
Of various.

3041
05:10:39,560 --> 05:10:44,560
Low cost animals.

3042
05:10:44,560 --> 05:10:45,560
I think I.

3043
05:10:45,560 --> 05:10:47,560
Mentioned that I had some fish and I.

3044
05:10:48,560 --> 05:10:50,560
Watched the fish tanks.

3045
05:10:50,560 --> 05:10:52,560
What they were doing for.

3046
05:10:52,560 --> 05:10:55,560
A very long time.

3047
05:10:55,560 --> 05:10:56,560
And.

3048
05:10:56,560 --> 05:10:58,560
Came to no conclusions at all.

3049
05:10:58,560 --> 05:10:59,560
And.

3050
05:10:59,560 --> 05:11:01,560
When I finally read.

3051
05:11:01,560 --> 05:11:03,560
Timbergen and Lorenz.

3052
05:11:03,560 --> 05:11:06,560
I realized that.

3053
05:11:06,560 --> 05:11:08,560
Just it never occurred to me.

3054
05:11:08,560 --> 05:11:09,560
To.

3055
05:11:09,560 --> 05:11:15,560
To guess what to look for.

3056
05:11:15,560 --> 05:11:17,560
My favorite one was.

3057
05:11:17,560 --> 05:11:21,560
That whenever a fire engine went by.

3058
05:11:21,560 --> 05:11:24,560
Lorenz's sticklebacks the male sticklebacks.

3059
05:11:24,560 --> 05:11:27,560
Would go crazy and look for a female.

3060
05:11:27,560 --> 05:11:30,560
Because when the females in heat or whatever it's called.

3061
05:11:30,560 --> 05:11:32,560
Estrus.

3062
05:11:32,560 --> 05:11:37,560
The lower abdomen turns red.

3063
05:11:37,560 --> 05:11:40,560
I think fire engines have turned yellow recently.

3064
05:11:40,560 --> 05:11:41,560
No one.

3065
05:11:41,560 --> 05:11:42,560
I don't know what the.

3066
05:11:42,560 --> 05:11:49,560
Sticklebacks do about that.

3067
05:11:49,560 --> 05:11:53,560
So if you're just an AI.

3068
05:11:53,560 --> 05:11:55,560
You really should look at.

3069
05:11:55,560 --> 05:11:57,560
At least one of these people.

3070
05:11:57,560 --> 05:12:00,560
Because.

3071
05:12:00,560 --> 05:12:02,560
It's the first appearance of rule based.

3072
05:12:02,560 --> 05:12:06,560
Systems in great detail in psychology.

3073
05:12:06,560 --> 05:12:17,560
There weren't any computers yet.

3074
05:12:17,560 --> 05:12:23,560
There must be 20 questions left.

3075
05:12:23,560 --> 05:12:24,560
Yeah.

3076
05:12:25,560 --> 05:12:27,560
So.

3077
05:12:27,560 --> 05:12:28,560
I know that.

3078
05:12:28,560 --> 05:12:30,560
Early on.

3079
05:12:30,560 --> 05:12:33,560
People were kind of.

3080
05:12:33,560 --> 05:12:35,560
They're careful not to apply.

3081
05:12:35,560 --> 05:12:38,560
Ecology of humans.

3082
05:12:38,560 --> 05:12:40,560
Till about 60s.

3083
05:12:40,560 --> 05:12:42,560
With.

3084
05:12:42,560 --> 05:12:44,560
Sociobiology.

3085
05:12:44,560 --> 05:12:46,560
So if you're thinking on that.

3086
05:12:46,560 --> 05:12:48,560
Maybe.

3087
05:12:48,560 --> 05:12:51,560
Around this area.

3088
05:12:51,560 --> 05:12:54,560
I don't know.

3089
05:12:54,560 --> 05:12:57,560
I sort of grew up with Ed Wilson because we.

3090
05:12:57,560 --> 05:13:00,560
Had the same fellowship at Harvard for three years.

3091
05:13:00,560 --> 05:13:02,560
But he was almost never there.

3092
05:13:02,560 --> 05:13:04,560
Because he was.

3093
05:13:04,560 --> 05:13:06,560
Out in the jungle in some little.

3094
05:13:06,560 --> 05:13:08,560
Telephone booth watching the.

3095
05:13:08,560 --> 05:13:10,560
Birds or.

3096
05:13:10,560 --> 05:13:14,560
Bees or.

3097
05:13:14,560 --> 05:13:18,560
You also had a 26 year old aunt.

3098
05:13:18,560 --> 05:13:20,560
Not aunt.

3099
05:13:20,560 --> 05:13:22,560
Aunt.

3100
05:13:26,560 --> 05:13:31,560
A and T.

3101
05:13:31,560 --> 05:13:34,560
I'm not sure what the controversy would have been but.

3102
05:13:34,560 --> 05:13:37,560
Of course.

3103
05:13:37,560 --> 05:13:40,560
There would be humanists who would say.

3104
05:13:40,560 --> 05:13:46,560
People aren't animals but.

3105
05:13:46,560 --> 05:13:51,560
But then what the devil are they.

3106
05:13:51,560 --> 05:13:58,560
Why aren't they better than they.

3107
05:13:58,560 --> 05:14:01,560
You've got to read this it's a fairly short book.

3108
05:14:01,560 --> 05:14:03,560
And you'll never.

3109
05:14:03,560 --> 05:14:05,560
See an animal is the same again.

3110
05:14:05,560 --> 05:14:06,560
Because.

3111
05:14:06,560 --> 05:14:08,560
I swear.

3112
05:14:08,560 --> 05:14:10,560
You start to notice.

3113
05:14:10,560 --> 05:14:13,560
All these little things you're probably wrong.

3114
05:14:13,560 --> 05:14:14,560
But.

3115
05:14:14,560 --> 05:14:18,560
You start picking up little pieces of behavior and trying to.

3116
05:14:18,560 --> 05:14:20,560
Figure out.

3117
05:14:20,560 --> 05:14:29,560
What what part of the instinct system is it and.

3118
05:14:29,560 --> 05:14:35,560
Lawrence was particularly I think in chapter two of the.

3119
05:14:35,560 --> 05:14:38,560
A motion machine I have some quotes from.

3120
05:14:38,560 --> 05:14:43,560
These guys and.

3121
05:14:43,560 --> 05:14:45,560
Lawrence was particularly interested in.

3122
05:14:45,560 --> 05:14:47,560
In how.

3123
05:14:47,560 --> 05:14:49,560
Animals got attached to their.

3124
05:14:49,560 --> 05:14:51,560
Parents that is.

3125
05:14:51,560 --> 05:14:54,560
For those animals that do get attached to.

3126
05:14:54,560 --> 05:14:56,560
Like alligator babies.

3127
05:14:56,560 --> 05:14:59,560
Live in the alligator's mouth.

3128
05:14:59,560 --> 05:15:02,560
For quite a while.

3129
05:15:02,560 --> 05:15:06,560
It's a good safe place.

3130
05:15:06,560 --> 05:15:09,560
And.

3131
05:15:09,560 --> 05:15:12,560
Lawrence would.

3132
05:15:13,560 --> 05:15:15,560
Catch birds.

3133
05:15:15,560 --> 05:15:17,560
Just when they're hatching.

3134
05:15:17,560 --> 05:15:20,560
And within the first day or so.

3135
05:15:20,560 --> 05:15:24,560
Some baby birds get attached to whatever large moving.

3136
05:15:24,560 --> 05:15:27,560
Object is nearby.

3137
05:15:27,560 --> 05:15:30,560
And he that was often Conrad Lawrence.

3138
05:15:30,560 --> 05:15:32,560
Rather than the birds.

3139
05:15:32,560 --> 05:15:34,560
Mother who's.

3140
05:15:34,560 --> 05:15:37,560
Supposed to be sitting on the egg when it hatches and.

3141
05:15:37,560 --> 05:15:39,560
The bird gets attached to the mother most.

3142
05:15:40,560 --> 05:15:42,560
Most birds do because.

3143
05:15:42,560 --> 05:15:45,560
They have to stay around and get fed.

3144
05:15:45,560 --> 05:15:47,560
So.

3145
05:15:47,560 --> 05:15:50,560
It is said that wherever Lawrence went.

3146
05:15:50,560 --> 05:15:53,560
In Vienna.

3147
05:15:53,560 --> 05:15:56,560
There were some ducks or whatever.

3148
05:15:56,560 --> 05:15:58,560
Birds that had gotten imprinted on him.

3149
05:15:58,560 --> 05:16:02,560
Would come out of the sky and land on his shoulder and.

3150
05:16:02,560 --> 05:16:06,560
And on no one else.

3151
05:16:06,560 --> 05:16:08,560
And he has various theories of.

3152
05:16:08,560 --> 05:16:10,560
How they recognize him.

3153
05:16:10,560 --> 05:16:12,560
But.

3154
05:16:12,560 --> 05:16:14,560
But you could do that too.

3155
05:16:22,560 --> 05:16:25,560
Anyway that was quite a field.

3156
05:16:25,560 --> 05:16:27,560
This thing called ethology.

3157
05:16:27,560 --> 05:16:29,560
And.

3158
05:16:29,560 --> 05:16:31,560
Between 1920 and 1950.

3159
05:16:31,560 --> 05:16:33,560
1930 I guess.

3160
05:16:34,560 --> 05:16:36,560
There were lots of people studying.

3161
05:16:36,560 --> 05:16:38,560
The behavior of animals and.

3162
05:16:38,560 --> 05:16:39,560
Ed Wilson is.

3163
05:16:39,560 --> 05:16:42,560
Probably the.

3164
05:16:42,560 --> 05:16:44,560
Most.

3165
05:16:44,560 --> 05:16:46,560
Well known successor to.

3166
05:16:46,560 --> 05:16:48,560
Lorenz and Timbergen.

3167
05:16:50,560 --> 05:16:52,560
And I think he just wrote a book is that.

3168
05:16:52,560 --> 05:16:54,560
Anybody seen it.

3169
05:16:56,560 --> 05:16:59,560
He has a huge book called socio biology.

3170
05:16:59,560 --> 05:17:01,560
Which is too heavy to read.

3171
05:17:04,560 --> 05:17:06,560
I've run out of things.

3172
05:17:09,560 --> 05:17:11,560
Yes.

3173
05:17:11,560 --> 05:17:13,560
Thank you.

3174
05:17:13,560 --> 05:17:15,560
Society of mind.

3175
05:17:15,560 --> 05:17:16,560
Ideas.

3176
05:17:16,560 --> 05:17:18,560
That book.

3177
05:17:18,560 --> 05:17:20,560
Had the machinery from it.

3178
05:17:20,560 --> 05:17:22,560
What would the initial state of the machine be.

3179
05:17:22,560 --> 05:17:23,560
You.

3180
05:17:23,560 --> 05:17:24,560
You.

3181
05:17:24,560 --> 05:17:25,560
You.

3182
05:17:25,560 --> 05:17:26,560
You.

3183
05:17:26,560 --> 05:17:27,560
You.

3184
05:17:27,560 --> 05:17:28,560
You.

3185
05:17:28,560 --> 05:17:29,560
You.

3186
05:17:29,560 --> 05:17:30,560
You.

3187
05:17:30,560 --> 05:17:32,560
You.

3188
05:17:32,560 --> 05:17:33,560
You.

3189
05:17:33,560 --> 05:17:34,560
You.

3190
05:17:34,560 --> 05:17:36,560
You.

3191
05:17:36,560 --> 05:17:37,560
You.

3192
05:17:37,560 --> 05:17:38,560
You.

3193
05:17:38,560 --> 05:17:40,560
You.

3194
05:17:40,560 --> 05:17:42,560
You.

3195
05:17:42,560 --> 05:17:43,560
You.

3196
05:17:43,560 --> 05:17:44,560
You.

3197
05:17:44,560 --> 05:17:45,560
You.

3198
05:17:45,560 --> 05:17:46,560
You.

3199
05:17:46,560 --> 05:17:47,560
You.

3200
05:17:47,560 --> 05:17:48,560
You.

3201
05:17:48,560 --> 05:17:49,560
You.

3202
05:17:49,560 --> 05:17:50,560
You.

3203
05:17:50,560 --> 05:17:51,560
You.

3204
05:17:51,560 --> 05:17:52,560
You.

3205
05:17:52,560 --> 05:17:53,560
You.

3206
05:17:53,560 --> 05:17:54,560
You.

3207
05:17:54,560 --> 05:17:55,560
You.

3208
05:17:55,560 --> 05:17:56,560
You.

3209
05:17:56,560 --> 05:17:57,560
You.

3210
05:17:57,560 --> 05:17:58,560
You you.

3211
05:17:58,560 --> 05:17:59,560
You.

3212
05:17:59,560 --> 05:18:02,320
I guess it depends whether you want it to be a person

3213
05:18:02,320 --> 05:18:07,000
or a marmoset or chicken or something.

3214
05:18:11,760 --> 05:18:14,880
Are there some animals that don't learn anything?

3215
05:18:14,880 --> 05:18:15,720
Must be.

3216
05:18:16,880 --> 05:18:21,640
What are the ones that Sidney Brenner studied?

3217
05:18:21,640 --> 05:18:25,920
See, I'm gonna say like, very simple associations.

3218
05:18:25,920 --> 05:18:27,020
The little worms?

3219
05:18:29,560 --> 05:18:40,560
There was a rumor that if you fed them RNA, was it them or was it some slightly higher animal?

3220
05:18:40,560 --> 05:18:43,960
It was worms.

3221
05:18:43,960 --> 05:18:44,960
What?

3222
05:18:44,960 --> 05:18:45,960
RNA interference.

3223
05:18:45,960 --> 05:18:46,960
Is that what you're talking about?

3224
05:18:46,960 --> 05:18:47,960
Yeah.

3225
05:18:47,960 --> 05:18:54,640
There was one that if you taught a worm to turn left when there was a bright light or

3226
05:18:54,640 --> 05:19:04,640
right and put some of its RNA into another worm, that worm would copy that reaction even

3227
05:19:04,640 --> 05:19:08,360
though it hadn't been trained.

3228
05:19:08,360 --> 05:19:09,360
And this was…

3229
05:19:09,360 --> 05:19:10,360
That's just a worm.

3230
05:19:10,360 --> 05:19:11,360
Is that what it is?

3231
05:19:11,360 --> 05:19:12,360
Slugs.

3232
05:19:12,360 --> 05:19:13,360
Slugs.

3233
05:19:13,360 --> 05:19:14,360
I think it was, yeah.

3234
05:19:14,360 --> 05:19:15,360
Yes.

3235
05:19:15,360 --> 05:19:16,360
It's a lazy-art scarex or something.

3236
05:19:16,360 --> 05:19:20,000
It's a little snail-like thing.

3237
05:19:20,000 --> 05:19:22,520
And nobody was ever able to replicate it.

3238
05:19:22,520 --> 05:19:32,080
So it's that rumor spread around the world quite happily and there was a great science

3239
05:19:32,080 --> 05:19:43,560
fiction story trying to remember in which somebody got to eat some of an alien's RNA

3240
05:19:43,560 --> 05:19:47,680
and got magical powers.

3241
05:19:47,680 --> 05:19:57,800
I think it's Larry Niven who is wonderful at taking little scientific ideas and making

3242
05:19:57,800 --> 05:20:01,440
a novel out of them.

3243
05:20:01,440 --> 05:20:09,280
And his wife Marilyn was a undergraduate here.

3244
05:20:09,280 --> 05:20:21,160
So she introduced me to Larry Niven and I once got to write an article.

3245
05:20:21,160 --> 05:20:23,880
I once gave a lecture and he wrote it up.

3246
05:20:23,880 --> 05:20:31,440
It was one of the big thrills because Niven was one of my heroes.

3247
05:20:31,440 --> 05:20:37,920
Imagine writing a book with a good idea in every paragraph.

3248
05:20:37,920 --> 05:20:49,560
Bernie Vingy and Larry Niven and Frederick Poe seem to be able to do that or at least

3249
05:20:49,560 --> 05:20:50,560
on every page.

3250
05:20:50,560 --> 05:20:51,560
I don't know about every paragraph.

3251
05:20:51,560 --> 05:20:52,560
Yeah.

3252
05:20:52,560 --> 05:21:01,560
To follow up on that question, it seems to me that you almost were saying that if this

3253
05:21:01,560 --> 05:21:08,560
was the difference between these sort of animals and depending on the start of the day, we

3254
05:21:08,560 --> 05:21:12,200
could either create a chicken or a human.

3255
05:21:12,200 --> 05:21:24,120
Well no, I don't think that I don't think that most animals have scripts.

3256
05:21:24,120 --> 05:21:40,600
I might, but I'd say that I don't know where most animals are, but I sort of make these

3257
05:21:40,600 --> 05:21:49,080
six levels and I'd say that none of the animals have this top self-reflective layer except

3258
05:21:49,240 --> 05:21:58,880
for all we know, dolphins and chimpanzees and whatever, it would be nice to know more

3259
05:21:58,880 --> 05:22:07,760
about octopuses because they do so much of wonderful things with their eight legs.

3260
05:22:07,760 --> 05:22:11,520
What kind of, how does it manage?

3261
05:22:11,520 --> 05:22:19,040
Have you seen pictures of an octopus picking up a shell and walking to some quiet place

3262
05:22:19,040 --> 05:22:27,720
that can, there's some movies of this on the web and then it drops the shell and climbs

3263
05:22:27,720 --> 05:22:29,280
under it and disappears.

3264
05:22:29,280 --> 05:22:36,280
It's hard to imagine programming a robot to do that.

3265
05:22:36,280 --> 05:22:37,280
Yeah.

3266
05:22:37,280 --> 05:22:47,280
So I've noticed both your books in the lecture, a lot of your models and diagrams seem to

3267
05:22:47,280 --> 05:22:53,280
have a very hierarchical structure to them, but as you mentioned in your book, other places,

3268
05:22:53,280 --> 05:22:58,280
passing between levels, feedback and self-reference are all very important to diligence.

3269
05:22:58,280 --> 05:23:04,280
So I'm curious if you could discuss some of the uses of these very hierarchical models,

3270
05:23:04,280 --> 05:23:08,280
why you represent so many things in that way and some implementation theory?

3271
05:23:08,280 --> 05:23:18,280
Well, it's probably very hard to debug things that aren't, so we need a sort of meta theory.

3272
05:23:18,280 --> 05:23:27,280
One thing is that, for example, it looks like that all neurons are almost the same.

3273
05:23:27,280 --> 05:23:33,280
Now, there's lots of difference in geometric features of them, but they all use the same

3274
05:23:34,280 --> 05:23:46,280
one or two transmitters and every now and then you run across people saying, oh, neurons

3275
05:23:46,280 --> 05:23:48,280
are incredibly complicated.

3276
05:23:48,280 --> 05:23:51,280
They have 100,000 connections.

3277
05:23:51,280 --> 05:24:00,280
You can find it if you just look up neuron on the web and get these essays, explaining

3278
05:24:00,280 --> 05:24:06,280
that nobody will ever understand them because typically a neuron is connected to 100,000

3279
05:24:06,280 --> 05:24:08,280
others and blah, blah, blah.

3280
05:24:08,280 --> 05:24:13,280
So it must be something inside the neuron that figures out all this stuff.

3281
05:24:13,280 --> 05:24:20,280
As far as I can see, it looks almost the opposite, namely probably the neuron hasn't changed

3282
05:24:20,280 --> 05:24:28,280
for half a billion years very much, except in sort of superficial ways in which it grows

3283
05:24:29,280 --> 05:24:38,280
because if you changed any of the genes controlling its metabolism or the way it propagates impulses,

3284
05:24:38,280 --> 05:24:48,280
then the animal would die before it was born.

3285
05:24:53,280 --> 05:24:57,280
That's why the embryology of all mammals is almost identical.

3286
05:24:57,280 --> 05:25:14,280
You can't make a change at that level after the first generations of cell divisions or

3287
05:25:14,280 --> 05:25:18,280
everything would be clobbered, the architecture would be all screwed up.

3288
05:25:18,280 --> 05:25:25,280
So I suspect that the people who say, well, maybe the important memories of a neuron are inside it

3289
05:25:25,280 --> 05:25:28,280
because there's so many fibers and things.

3290
05:25:28,280 --> 05:25:36,280
I bet it's sort of like saying the important memory in a computer is in the arsenic and phosphorus atoms

3291
05:25:36,280 --> 05:25:39,280
of the semiconductor.

3292
05:25:39,280 --> 05:25:49,280
So I think things have to be hierarchical in evolution because if you're building later stuff on earlier stuff,

3293
05:25:49,280 --> 05:25:54,280
then it's very hard to make any changes in the earlier stuff.

3294
05:25:54,280 --> 05:26:03,280
So as far as I know, the neurons in sea anemones are almost identical to the neurons in mammals

3295
05:26:03,280 --> 05:26:14,280
except for the later stages of growth and the way the fibers ramify.

3296
05:26:15,280 --> 05:26:24,280
Who knows, but there are many people who want to find the secret of the brain in what's inside the neurons

3297
05:26:24,280 --> 05:26:29,280
rather than outside.

3298
05:26:29,280 --> 05:26:36,280
It would be nice to get a textbook on neurology from 50 years in the future,

3299
05:26:36,280 --> 05:26:42,280
see how much of that stuff mattered.

3300
05:26:42,280 --> 05:26:46,280
Where are time machines?

3301
05:26:46,280 --> 05:26:52,280
Most systems have a state that they prefer to be in, like a state that they're most comfortable in.

3302
05:26:52,280 --> 05:27:00,280
Do you think the mind has such a state or would it tend to certain places?

3303
05:27:00,280 --> 05:27:06,280
That's interesting. How does that apply to living things?

3304
05:27:06,280 --> 05:27:12,280
I mean this bottle would rather be here than here, but I'm not sure what you mean.

3305
05:27:12,280 --> 05:27:24,280
Okay, so apparently in Professor Tannenbaum's class he shows this example of a number game.

3306
05:27:24,280 --> 05:27:28,280
He'll give you a sequence of numbers and he'll ask you to find a pattern in it.

3307
05:27:28,280 --> 05:27:33,280
For example, if you had a pattern like 10, 40, 50, and 55,

3308
05:27:33,280 --> 05:27:38,280
he kind of asks the class to come up with different things that could be describing the sequence.

3309
05:27:38,280 --> 05:27:46,280
Between the choice of, oh this sequence is a sequence of the multiples of 5

3310
05:27:46,280 --> 05:27:52,280
versus a sequence of the multiples of 10 or multiples of 11.

3311
05:27:52,280 --> 05:27:59,280
He says something like the multiples of 5 would have a higher private probability.

3312
05:27:59,280 --> 05:28:04,280
So that got me thinking, why would that be?

3313
05:28:04,280 --> 05:28:10,280
Would our minds have a preference for having as few categories as possible

3314
05:28:10,280 --> 05:28:12,280
and trying to view the world around us?

3315
05:28:12,280 --> 05:28:18,280
Trying to categorize things and as few things as possible?

3316
05:28:18,280 --> 05:28:28,280
Sounds very strange to me, but certainly if you're going to generate hypotheses,

3317
05:28:28,280 --> 05:28:41,280
you have to have the way you do it depends on what does this problem remind you of.

3318
05:28:41,280 --> 05:28:50,280
So I don't see how you could make a general...

3319
05:28:50,280 --> 05:28:56,280
If you look at the history of psychology, there are so many efforts to find four laws,

3320
05:28:56,280 --> 05:28:59,280
three laws of motion like Newton's.

3321
05:28:59,280 --> 05:29:06,280
Is he trying to do that?

3322
05:29:06,280 --> 05:29:20,280
And here you're talking about people with language and high level semantics.

3323
05:29:20,280 --> 05:29:32,280
Let's ask him what he meant.

3324
05:29:32,280 --> 05:29:36,280
Yeah, it's more of a social question, but there's always this debate about

3325
05:29:36,280 --> 05:29:41,280
how if AI gets to a point where it can take care of humans, will it ever destroy humanity?

3326
05:29:41,280 --> 05:29:45,280
And do you think that's something that we should fear?

3327
05:29:45,280 --> 05:29:55,280
And if so, is there some way we can prevent it?

3328
05:29:55,280 --> 05:30:15,280
If you judge by what's happened in AI since 1980, it's hard to imagine anything to fear.

3329
05:30:15,280 --> 05:30:22,280
Funny you should mention that I'm just trying to organize a conference sometime next year

3330
05:30:22,280 --> 05:30:25,280
about disasters.

3331
05:30:25,280 --> 05:30:32,280
And there's a nice book about disasters by...

3332
05:30:32,280 --> 05:30:34,280
What's his name?

3333
05:30:34,280 --> 05:30:37,280
The Royal... The Astronomer Royal.

3334
05:30:37,280 --> 05:30:38,280
What?

3335
05:30:38,280 --> 05:30:40,280
Martin Rees.

3336
05:30:40,280 --> 05:30:48,280
So he has a nice book which I just ordered from Amazon and it came the next day.

3337
05:30:48,280 --> 05:31:00,280
And it has about ten disasters like a big meteor coming and hitting the earth.

3338
05:31:00,280 --> 05:31:04,280
I forget the other ten, but I have it in here somewhere.

3339
05:31:04,280 --> 05:31:10,280
So I generated another list of ten to go with it.

3340
05:31:10,280 --> 05:31:18,280
So there are lots of bad things that could happen.

3341
05:31:18,280 --> 05:31:31,280
But I think right now that's not on the top of the list of disasters.

3342
05:31:31,280 --> 05:31:41,280
Eventually some hacker ought to be able to stop the net from working because it's not very secure.

3343
05:31:41,280 --> 05:31:58,280
And while you're at it, you could probably knock out all of the navigation satellites and maybe set off a few nuclear reactors.

3344
05:31:58,280 --> 05:32:04,280
But I don't think AI is the principal thing to worry about.

3345
05:32:04,280 --> 05:32:08,280
But it should very suddenly get to be a problem.

3346
05:32:08,280 --> 05:32:11,280
And there are lots of good science fiction stories.

3347
05:32:11,280 --> 05:32:17,280
My favorite is the Colossus series by DF Jones.

3348
05:32:17,280 --> 05:32:19,280
Anybody know?

3349
05:32:19,280 --> 05:32:22,280
There was a movie called The Forbidden Project.

3350
05:32:22,280 --> 05:32:29,280
And it's about somebody who builds an AI and it's trained to do some learning.

3351
05:32:29,280 --> 05:32:39,280
And it's also the early days of the web and it starts talking to another computer in Russia.

3352
05:32:39,280 --> 05:32:50,280
And suddenly it gets faster and faster and takes over all the computers in the world and gets control of all the missiles.

3353
05:32:50,280 --> 05:32:54,280
Because they're linked to the network.

3354
05:32:54,280 --> 05:33:07,280
And it says, I will destroy all the cities in the world unless you clear off some island and start building the following machine.

3355
05:33:07,280 --> 05:33:10,280
I think it's Sardinia or someplace.

3356
05:33:10,280 --> 05:33:16,280
So they get bulldozers.

3357
05:33:16,280 --> 05:33:21,280
And it starts building another machine which it calls Colossus 2.

3358
05:33:21,280 --> 05:33:25,280
And they ask, what's it going to do?

3359
05:33:25,280 --> 05:33:36,280
And Colossus says, well, you see, I have detected that there's a really bad AI out in space and it's coming this way.

3360
05:33:36,280 --> 05:33:42,280
And I have to make myself smarter than it really quick.

3361
05:33:43,280 --> 05:33:50,280
Anyway, see if you can order the sequel to Colossus.

3362
05:33:50,280 --> 05:33:57,280
That's the second volume where the invader actually arrives and I forget what happens.

3363
05:33:57,280 --> 05:34:08,280
And then there's a third one which was an anticlimax because I guess D.F. Jones couldn't think of anything worse that could happen.

3364
05:34:08,280 --> 05:34:14,280
But Martin Rees can.

3365
05:34:14,280 --> 05:34:15,280
Yeah.

3366
05:34:15,280 --> 05:34:30,280
Going back to her question, an example, if my mind has a state, would that example be more of a pattern recognition example?

3367
05:34:30,280 --> 05:34:35,280
So instead of 10, 40, 50, 55, it wasn't physical.

3368
05:34:35,280 --> 05:34:38,280
Good, fine, great.

3369
05:34:38,280 --> 05:34:46,280
And you have to come up with a word that could potentially fit in that pattern.

3370
05:34:46,280 --> 05:34:49,280
And then that pattern could be ways to answer it.

3371
05:34:49,280 --> 05:34:50,280
How are we?

3372
05:34:50,280 --> 05:34:52,280
Let's do an experiment.

3373
05:34:52,280 --> 05:34:55,280
How many of you have a resting state?

3374
05:35:01,280 --> 05:35:16,280
Sometimes when I have nothing else to do, I try to think of twinkle, twinkle, little star happening with the second one starting in the second measure.

3375
05:35:16,280 --> 05:35:20,280
And then the third one starts up the third measure.

3376
05:35:20,280 --> 05:35:24,280
And when that happens, I start losing the first one.

3377
05:35:24,280 --> 05:35:42,280
And ever since I was a baby, when I have nothing else to do, which is almost never, I try to think of three versions of the same tune at once and usually fail.

3378
05:35:42,280 --> 05:35:46,280
What do you do when you have nothing else to do?

3379
05:35:46,280 --> 05:35:48,280
Any volunteers?

3380
05:35:48,280 --> 05:35:49,280
What's yours?

3381
05:35:49,280 --> 05:35:52,280
I don't have to think anything at all.

3382
05:35:52,280 --> 05:35:54,280
All right, not two or two?

3383
05:35:54,280 --> 05:35:56,280
Not two.

3384
05:35:56,280 --> 05:35:59,280
Isn't that a sort of Buddhist thing?

3385
05:35:59,280 --> 05:36:01,280
Yes, sir.

3386
05:36:01,280 --> 05:36:02,280
Do you ever succeed?

3387
05:36:02,280 --> 05:36:04,280
How do you get out of it?

3388
05:36:04,280 --> 05:36:09,280
You have to think, well, enough of this, nothingness.

3389
05:36:09,280 --> 05:36:11,280
If you succeeded, wouldn't you be dead?

3390
05:36:11,280 --> 05:36:15,280
We're stuck.

3391
05:36:15,280 --> 05:36:20,280
Eventually some stimulus will appear that is too interesting to ignore.

3392
05:36:20,280 --> 05:36:28,280
Right, and threshold goes down until even the most boring thing is fascinated.

3393
05:36:28,280 --> 05:36:33,280
Make a good short story.

3394
05:36:33,280 --> 05:36:38,280
There was actually a movie that really got to me when I was little.

3395
05:36:38,280 --> 05:36:44,280
These aliens were trying to infiltrate people's brains and like their thoughts.

3396
05:36:44,280 --> 05:36:49,280
To keep the aliens from infiltrating your thoughts, you had to think of a wall,

3397
05:36:49,280 --> 05:36:57,280
which didn't make any sense at all, but now whenever I try to think of nothing,

3398
05:36:57,280 --> 05:37:06,280
I just end up thinking of a wall.

3399
05:37:06,280 --> 05:37:17,280
These awful psychoses and about every five years,

3400
05:37:17,280 --> 05:37:24,280
I get an email from someone who says that,

3401
05:37:24,280 --> 05:37:28,280
please help me, there's some people who are putting these terrible ideas in my head.

3402
05:37:28,280 --> 05:37:31,280
Have you ever gotten one, Pat?

3403
05:37:31,280 --> 05:37:39,280
And they're sort of scary because you realize that maybe the person

3404
05:37:39,280 --> 05:37:52,280
will suddenly figure out that it's you who's doing it.

3405
05:37:52,280 --> 05:38:08,280
I remember there was once,

3406
05:38:08,280 --> 05:38:14,280
one of them came to visit, actually showed up and he came to visit Norbert Wiener,

3407
05:38:14,280 --> 05:38:20,280
who is famous for, I mean he's the cybernetics person of the world.

3408
05:38:20,280 --> 05:38:29,280
And this person came in and he got between Wiener and the door

3409
05:38:29,280 --> 05:38:36,280
and started explaining that somebody was putting dirty words in his head

3410
05:38:36,280 --> 05:38:41,280
and making the grass on their lawn die.

3411
05:38:41,280 --> 05:38:49,280
And he was sure it was someone in the government and this was getting pretty scary.

3412
05:38:49,280 --> 05:38:57,280
I was near the door, so I went and got lethin.

3413
05:38:57,280 --> 05:39:03,280
It's a true story because nearby and I got lethin to come in

3414
05:39:03,280 --> 05:39:09,280
and lethin actually took this guy down and took him by the arm and went somewhere

3415
05:39:09,280 --> 05:39:15,280
and I don't know what happened, but Wiener was really scared

3416
05:39:15,280 --> 05:39:20,280
because the guy kept keeping him from going out.

3417
05:39:20,280 --> 05:39:30,280
Lethin was big. Wiener is not very big.

3418
05:39:30,280 --> 05:39:36,280
Anyway, that keeps happening every few years.

3419
05:39:36,280 --> 05:39:41,280
I get one and I don't answer them.

3420
05:39:41,280 --> 05:39:46,280
He's probably sending it to several people and I'm sure one of them

3421
05:39:46,280 --> 05:39:50,280
is much better at it than we are.

3422
05:39:50,280 --> 05:39:55,280
How many of you have ever had to deal with an obsessed person?

3423
05:39:55,280 --> 05:39:58,280
How did they find you?

3424
05:39:58,280 --> 05:40:05,280
I don't know. They found a number of people in the media lab, actually.

3425
05:40:05,280 --> 05:40:08,280
Don't answer anything.

3426
05:40:08,280 --> 05:40:24,280
But if they actually come, then it's not clear what to do.

3427
05:40:24,280 --> 05:40:29,280
Last question.

3428
05:40:29,280 --> 05:40:32,280
Thanks for coming.

3429
05:40:35,280 --> 05:40:39,280
Thank you.
