It seems like you are planning to organize items within your truck, specifically setting something down in a particular location relative to two components labeled "F8s." You mention that you will be arranging or placing these items repeatedly over different threads (discussions or locations), ensuring that they are positioned correctly with respect to the F8s. The process is repeated multiple times to confirm the setup, and eventually, you conclude by indicating that everything is now set up as intended next to the two F8s in your truck. After finishing the arrangement, you invite someone (or yourself) to proceed with the next step or continue the conversation.
