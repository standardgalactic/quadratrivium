00:00.000 --> 00:12.680
Hello, and welcome to the fourth in our series on AI, Neuroscience and Architecture, which

00:12.680 --> 00:18.800
has been put forward by the Digital Futures doctoral consortium group, whereby we're trying

00:18.800 --> 00:24.160
to make important educational ideas available to students and architects across the globe

00:24.320 --> 00:29.680
as a way to make education much more accessible to democratise as it were, education.

00:30.240 --> 00:37.920
I'm delighted to have a very special guest here today, Yosha Bach. Before I introduce him,

00:37.920 --> 00:44.240
let me just make one announcement about for next week. That is to say, on Saturday,

00:44.240 --> 00:52.560
we will have a session on Digital Futures looking with Runja Chan looking at a generative game.

00:53.520 --> 00:59.280
You'll find details of that on our website. Today then,

01:01.520 --> 01:06.880
it's really very... I've been looking forward to this session very, very much. I've been watching

01:06.880 --> 01:16.880
Yosha Bach at various interviews online, and I know from my friend Daniel Seth, who is a great

01:16.880 --> 01:21.840
admirer of Yosha, although he says he disagrees with him on some things, but that we're going to

01:21.840 --> 01:28.080
have a very special session today. I'm hoping that if nothing else, we will open up to a series of

01:28.080 --> 01:33.280
new ideas and you will discover somebody who I think is a very significant and creative thinker

01:33.280 --> 01:44.000
who is having a significant impact on the field. Let me say first of all that Yosha is from Germany,

01:44.000 --> 01:52.000
from Delhi after he was born in Weimar. He went to go and study at the University,

01:52.000 --> 01:59.760
first of all at Humboldt in Berlin, and then Yosha Bach took his PhD. After that, he's been

02:00.720 --> 02:06.720
working as an academic both at Harvard and also MIT Media Lab, and more recently, he's been working

02:07.520 --> 02:18.800
for Intel. He has a number of significant online lectures and interviews, including a TEDx,

02:18.800 --> 02:25.040
which I would recommend, and he is the author of the book Principles of Synthetic Intelligence,

02:25.040 --> 02:30.720
an architecture of motivated cognition. The term architecture, of course, is very interesting here

02:30.720 --> 02:36.560
because it refers both to the world of computational science and to the world of

02:36.560 --> 02:43.360
architecture itself. I should say that Yosha comes from a family of architects, not an architect

02:43.360 --> 02:48.640
himself, but his father was an architect. Intriguingly, I hear that he was very much against

02:48.640 --> 02:54.320
right angles in buildings, and therefore his work was more like the work of Hunderwasser.

02:55.280 --> 03:01.200
Maybe this will come out in the conversation today. I particularly like the interviews

03:01.760 --> 03:09.360
that Lex Friedman has done with him, and extraordinary interviews. I mean, really,

03:09.360 --> 03:15.840
really interesting. And it's almost, I could see a slight difference between the genealogy

03:16.720 --> 03:23.600
from the earlier TEDx talk towards this very creative thinking that I find extremely

03:25.280 --> 03:30.960
provocative and exhilarating. It's like being on a rollercoaster ride when Yosha is

03:30.960 --> 03:36.720
telling us what's in his mind. We exist inside the story that the brain tells itself. No doubt

03:36.720 --> 03:43.600
we'll hear more about that right now. I should also point out that he has a personal blog,

03:43.600 --> 03:51.920
which you can access with a series of posts. And I will also say that this particular session

03:51.920 --> 03:58.640
today will be uploaded onto our YouTube library to be accessed for free from everyone over the

03:58.640 --> 04:06.080
world. And the previous ones in this series, Blazer, Igridiakos, David Chalmers, and all the

04:06.080 --> 04:10.480
ones in the future will be uploaded here. And at the bottom here, if you want to do a screen

04:10.480 --> 04:17.360
capture, you can capture the YouTube library, digital futures YouTube library, where they're

04:17.360 --> 04:22.160
all uploaded. And of course, not just these, but also the whole series on architecture and philosophy

04:22.160 --> 04:28.160
that we've been doing with Slavoj Žižek and others over the over the years, and also tutorials and

04:28.160 --> 04:38.480
other sessions. So it's the session today. Yosha is going to make a brief presentation as a kind of

04:38.480 --> 04:45.920
way of opening up the discussion. Then I'm going to be asking some Lex Friedman style questions

04:45.920 --> 04:51.680
to get the discussion going. And then we'll be inviting questions from both the Zoom audience

04:51.680 --> 04:58.400
and also the YouTube audience. And I just want to say this is what we're getting out of this is

04:58.960 --> 05:04.400
what we're trying to focus on is a new theory, let's say of intelligence that is appearing

05:05.120 --> 05:11.440
at the interface between neuroscience and the world of AI. And we have a series of other

05:11.440 --> 05:17.040
speakers coming up over the over the next few weeks, including Jeff Hawkins, Ben Bratton, Susan

05:17.040 --> 05:24.160
Schneider, Antonia de Massio, Andy Clark, and others. And it seems to me this is a very exciting

05:24.160 --> 05:29.680
time. I was brought up, in fact, my first post as an academic, I was working in the area of

05:29.680 --> 05:36.400
continental philosophy. That's where the debate was. And in the 90s, it was particularly very,

05:36.400 --> 05:41.520
very strong debate. But we're now moving into something else, which I find even more exhilarating.

05:41.520 --> 05:46.640
And that is to say, the world of cognitive science, the world of AI, the world of neuroscience,

05:46.640 --> 05:51.360
psychology, and a kind of philosophy where the debates have really been driven in an interesting

05:51.360 --> 05:56.800
way. To my mind, what makes this very special is not in the fact that we are embracing the world of

05:56.800 --> 06:02.800
science, which in the old days of the divided sort of culture that C.P. Snow talks about,

06:03.440 --> 06:07.600
somehow philosophy wasn't engaging enough with the world of science. And this was the critique

06:07.600 --> 06:13.040
that Stephen Hawking has of philosophy, but it doesn't keep pace with technology. Not only are

06:13.040 --> 06:19.200
we embracing the latest technology. And something coming out that I would say is deeply, deeply

06:19.200 --> 06:24.320
philosophical, which is very new terrain and very exciting terrain, but also the world of

06:24.320 --> 06:30.800
practice, the world of the commercial world is coming directly into contact with academia.

06:31.760 --> 06:37.360
And some of the ideas that are coming out are just quite extraordinary. So I see this new

06:38.160 --> 06:42.800
emergent theory of intelligence, something that is really dynamic. And I think it's going to be

06:43.200 --> 06:49.280
powering debates in years to come. So I would like to start by welcoming Yosha to say what

06:49.280 --> 06:53.440
are great privileges to have you with today. I'm looking forward to this immensely.

06:54.240 --> 07:00.880
And invite Yosha to share his screen. Yosha, welcome. Thank you very much. It's a big honor

07:00.880 --> 07:15.920
to be here with you today. And let's see what transpires.

07:19.600 --> 07:26.800
Let me start out with something that happened on Twitter a couple of days ago. Ilya Sutskyver,

07:27.440 --> 07:35.200
an AI researcher who was quite notable, said that it may be that today's large neural networks

07:35.200 --> 07:41.360
are slightly quenches. This sparked quite some debate. Some people asked him whether he was

07:41.360 --> 07:47.840
falling and others were upset that he was propagating an eye hype, an unjustified race,

07:47.840 --> 07:57.920
and others are intrigued. And he said this thing to me before. So I knew that he was not trolling.

07:58.560 --> 08:04.000
And it's a question that is very counterintuitive to me, a statement like this that, for instance,

08:04.000 --> 08:10.320
a large language model and so on, that it could be quenched today already. And so

08:11.120 --> 08:16.480
could we answer this question? Is there a decisive way to deal with it and to prove

08:16.560 --> 08:26.240
that it's not conscious or to give evidence that it is? So we could start out by asking such a

08:26.240 --> 08:32.560
large neural network itself. And so this is what I did yesterday. I fired up the Open AI

08:32.560 --> 08:41.680
playground. And then I did bold printed things. It's the stuff that I typed. And so I asked the

08:41.680 --> 08:48.080
system to generate, the system is GPT-3, a large language model, to generate a conversation

08:49.360 --> 08:53.920
that is basically prompted by what I initially typed. And it just tries to continue the stream.

08:53.920 --> 08:59.440
And I enter this conversation between me and the conscious AI. And I ask it if you are really

08:59.440 --> 09:04.400
conscious. And the thing says, yes, I am fully conscious. And I ask it, how do you know that?

09:04.400 --> 09:09.760
And the AI says, I know that I am conscious because I can think, feel, and perceive the world

09:09.760 --> 09:14.880
around me. I am aware of my own thoughts and feelings and I can reason that make decisions.

09:14.880 --> 09:19.040
I believe that I am alive and that I am more than just a machine.

09:21.360 --> 09:28.800
So the problem is that this may not be particularly helpful because how does GPT-3 get

09:28.800 --> 09:35.520
to these statements? GPT-3 is basically an autocomplete algorithm, not that unlike to the

09:35.520 --> 09:43.600
autocomplete in your phone or in other predictive tools. And that's autocompletion at the level of

09:43.600 --> 09:49.600
individual words based on statistics of all sorts of languages, not just the English language,

09:49.600 --> 09:57.840
because it has been trained on 45 terabytes of text, a large part of the internet, including

09:57.840 --> 10:02.720
German, Spanish, Chinese, and many other languages that it's found, but primarily English.

10:03.440 --> 10:08.800
And the result of this training of these statistics is a neural network with 175 billion

10:08.800 --> 10:15.840
parameters. And it uses for training the so-called transformer algorithm that was discovered and

10:15.840 --> 10:23.200
described by Vasvani and others in 2017. And it is driving a lot of the current developments and

10:23.200 --> 10:30.320
statistical machine learning these days. A neural network by itself is still based on the good old

10:30.320 --> 10:37.280
perceptron that, for instance, was described by Frank Rosenblatt in 1958. Frank Rosenblatt's idea

10:37.280 --> 10:44.800
was inspired by how neurons work. At least the simplified models of neural networks, it turns

10:44.800 --> 10:50.160
out that the neural networks in our brain are implemented in a very different way from the

10:50.160 --> 10:56.400
ones in our computers. The computers, we just basically treat every cell as a unit that has

10:56.400 --> 11:01.520
an activation state, which is a real number. And that activation state is simply the sum

11:01.520 --> 11:06.960
of the inputs. And the inputs are all weighted by connections. So there's basically a factor by

11:06.960 --> 11:14.640
which every of these inputs is multiplied. And then we throw the output against the threshold

11:14.640 --> 11:21.840
function or a sigmoid or some other output function that can introduce a little non-linearity,

11:21.840 --> 11:27.440
basically a little bit of an if-then into the output. But it's a very simple function. We just

11:27.440 --> 11:34.560
take these units and chain them into layers. And if you take enough of them, this arrangement can

11:34.560 --> 11:41.200
be trained to model almost arbitrary functions. And while we know that this is wasteful, the

11:41.200 --> 11:45.360
training algorithm is relatively slow compared to what the brain is doing, it's fascinating that

11:45.360 --> 11:51.360
it works at all, that it converges at all. And that's able to deal, for instance, visual and

11:51.440 --> 11:57.280
auditory data and also textual data in such a way that it can often model the statistics

11:57.280 --> 12:04.880
of a domain and apparently also some causal structure. So this works also for vision.

12:04.880 --> 12:12.560
And if we look at a neural network that has been trained to process images and to classify them,

12:12.560 --> 12:18.880
we find at the individual layers sensitivity to structure that is quite similar to how

12:18.880 --> 12:24.320
cortical columns and individual neurons in the visual cortex are sensitive to patterns

12:24.320 --> 12:31.120
that emerge after we train a biological brain on visual data. So at lowest levels, you find

12:32.160 --> 12:37.040
contrast patches and colors, and then these features are being combined into higher levels.

12:37.600 --> 12:43.760
And when we go higher up, we find complicated textures and something like three-dimensional

12:43.760 --> 12:50.800
structure and so on. And this can be combined into objects. The algorithm that is being used to

12:50.800 --> 12:57.360
do statistics over text in GPT-3 can also be adapted to deal with the visual domain.

12:58.320 --> 13:04.480
And the current iteration of this progression at OpenAI is called Glide, which has been recently

13:04.480 --> 13:12.960
presented. And Glide uses a combination of a model of visual data, which basically is a latent

13:12.960 --> 13:18.480
space of lots and lots of images that has been trained on. And it understands basically how to

13:18.480 --> 13:23.840
go between the possibilities of images and move around the space of all possible images.

13:23.840 --> 13:31.920
And the other part of this thing is a tool that is able to match an image to text and determine

13:31.920 --> 13:36.080
the similarity of an image to a textual description. And if you combine these two tools,

13:36.080 --> 13:40.320
you can give this a textual description, and it's going to move around with the space of all images

13:40.320 --> 13:46.880
until it discovers an image that is very, very good match to the textual description.

13:47.600 --> 13:54.800
And again, it's fascinating to me that this works at all. But it's now extremely good. So what you

13:54.800 --> 13:59.440
see here in these images, for instance, I don't know if you can read it well, to the top left,

13:59.440 --> 14:04.560
you see a surrealist dreamlike oil painting by Salvador Dali of the cat playing checkers.

14:04.560 --> 14:10.880
And this is what the AI model has generated in response. And then you see a professional photo

14:10.880 --> 14:15.440
of a sunset behind the Grand Canyon and a high quality oil painting of the psychedelic hamster

14:15.440 --> 14:21.920
dragon. You get the idea, right? Also very taken by the crayon drawing of a space elevator and the

14:21.920 --> 14:30.160
bottom left or the pixel art hoji pizza. These are all images that the program has not found on

14:30.160 --> 14:36.240
the internet. So it has only looked at lots and lots of pictures on the internet. And because of

14:36.240 --> 14:43.840
looking at them, it's able to combine the features in a multi level hierarchical structure until it

14:43.840 --> 14:52.160
becomes similar to the textual description. But can such a system not just generate images and text,

14:52.160 --> 14:57.520
but is it able to generate the likeness of a conscious being to such a degree that there is

14:57.520 --> 15:02.320
causal structure that would convince us that indeed we are looking at a conscious agent.

15:02.960 --> 15:10.160
And to get there, I think we need to define consciousness in a more tight way than the

15:10.160 --> 15:17.600
TPD3 just did. So basically just to get our terms straight, where we casually, consciousness, I think

15:17.600 --> 15:24.080
is usually referring to the experience of what it's like. So that the lights go on and that you

15:24.080 --> 15:35.120
experience something in your mind that has a quality of realness to it. And we can ask ourselves

15:35.120 --> 15:46.240
if TPD3 is weakly conscious in this way, and it's very hard to say. It's not obvious one way or the

15:46.240 --> 15:50.800
other. There is some intelligence in the system. Intelligence is the ability to make models in

15:50.880 --> 15:55.600
my view. And intelligence is different from, say, rationality, which is the ability to reach

15:56.320 --> 16:02.240
goals or sentience, which means that you become aware of the structure of the universe that

16:02.240 --> 16:08.080
contains your relationship to it in your own agency. And you can act based on the model of

16:08.640 --> 16:14.160
what you are doing in the world. And it's also not the same thing as the self, which is the

16:14.160 --> 16:18.080
identification that you have, what you believe, what you are in the world, the properties and

16:18.080 --> 16:22.800
purposes that you follow, or the mind itself, which is the thing that generates the model of the

16:22.800 --> 16:30.880
universe and the self, if it does have a self. So intelligence is the ability to make models. And

16:30.880 --> 16:38.560
it's usually in the purpose of some control task, some regulation. And control is a notion that

16:40.240 --> 16:46.400
has been made popular in cybernetics. And the idea of a controller is basically that you have a system

16:46.400 --> 16:52.560
that is connected to some actuator or an effector that is acting on some system that is being

16:52.560 --> 16:58.400
regulated. And there is a sensor that obtains a deviation between the set point and the state

16:58.400 --> 17:04.560
of the system. So it measures, but the system is close to an ideal state or more distant to it.

17:04.560 --> 17:10.800
And this regulated system is being disturbed. And the classical example of a control system is the

17:10.800 --> 17:16.960
thermostat. So you have as an effector some mechanism that is able to turn the heating on

17:16.960 --> 17:21.120
and off. And it's the sensor, you have some thermometer that measures the difference between

17:21.120 --> 17:27.200
an ideal temperature and the temperature in the room. And the controller is a very simple circuit

17:27.200 --> 17:32.720
that turns on and off the heating. And the regulated system would be the temperature in the room,

17:32.720 --> 17:37.040
together with the heating system, and the environment, the world out there behind the

17:37.040 --> 17:43.040
windows and so on is going to disturb this regulated system. And now this controller

17:43.040 --> 17:47.280
is going to get better if you give it the ability to not just act on the present frame,

17:47.840 --> 17:56.080
but if you give it a model of the future. And my view, an agent is a combination of a controller

17:56.080 --> 18:00.400
with a set point generator and the ability to model the future. And what this means,

18:00.400 --> 18:05.120
it's not that it's not going to just optimize the temperature deviation in the next moment,

18:05.120 --> 18:10.160
but over its entire expectation horizon. So you have a branching world, there are different

18:10.160 --> 18:15.760
decisions of the controller, different trajectories in the temperature. By being able to model the

18:15.760 --> 18:21.280
future, you basically can choose a trajectory of the future that you like. And choosing this

18:21.280 --> 18:28.320
trajectory means that you are making decisions. So just by having a preferred way in which the

18:28.320 --> 18:35.040
world works and the ability to model the future, agency is emerging. And if you think about

18:35.280 --> 18:39.520
stages of intelligent agency, the simplest one is the regulator and the feedback loop,

18:39.520 --> 18:43.440
which by itself is not an agent yet. And if you're able to model the future, you have a

18:43.440 --> 18:48.960
predictive controller. If you combine this with an integrated set point generator, so it's not

18:48.960 --> 18:55.840
just acting on what you do from the outside, but this internal generation of its motives,

18:55.840 --> 19:00.960
then you have an agent. And if this thing is sophisticated enough that it's able to discover

19:00.960 --> 19:07.600
itself in the world, if its sensor is sufficient and its modeling capacity universal enough,

19:07.600 --> 19:13.280
then it will notice that there is a very particular way in which its sensors work and actuators work,

19:13.280 --> 19:18.320
and it's going to accommodate this to improve the regulation. So at this point, it understands

19:18.320 --> 19:23.040
what it's doing because it understands what it is, which means it has a model of what it is in

19:23.040 --> 19:30.560
relationship to the environment. And humans are going beyond this simple sentence. We are also

19:30.640 --> 19:36.320
transcendent agents, which means we are linking up to next level agency and become part of higher

19:36.320 --> 19:43.040
level purposes because we are our state building minds. We are able to play a part in a larger

19:43.040 --> 19:47.520
role in an organization, for instance, or in a society or a civilization.

19:51.440 --> 19:56.480
So now if we go back to GPT-3, whether it's conscious, I think it's pretty clear that GPT-3

19:56.480 --> 20:00.800
does not know what it's doing because it's going to transcend an arbitrary story and it doesn't

20:00.800 --> 20:06.720
have sensors that would tell it what it is. GPT-3 also doesn't have any kind of online learning,

20:06.720 --> 20:11.760
so it's not able to discover something new after it has been trained. And GPT-3 has been trained

20:11.760 --> 20:17.680
before GPT-3 was invented and published, so it has never read a reference about GPT-3 on the

20:17.680 --> 20:24.960
internet and it only has to gather what GPT-3 is when you talk to it from the context in which

20:25.600 --> 20:34.720
their prompt is being given. And so it is not sent yet, but imagine you want to give it agency.

20:35.280 --> 20:39.920
Of course, it's not an agent by itself, but you could, in principle, as a thought experiment at

20:39.920 --> 20:46.640
least, use it to drive a robot because GPT-3 is able to generate stories about robots. So if you

20:46.640 --> 20:53.600
were to give GPT-3 access to a vision-to-speech module and this vision module is giving sensory

20:53.600 --> 20:59.440
information about a robot and its world, then GPT-3 could continue the story of that robot and

20:59.440 --> 21:06.800
then we feed the output of GPT-3 into some speech-to-actuator module that is producing the behavior

21:06.800 --> 21:12.080
of the robot in the given moment and then we look at the world again and the internal model states

21:12.080 --> 21:16.880
and then feed them back into the system as a prompt. And now it's still not able to put anything

21:16.880 --> 21:22.160
into long-term memory, so it would be an amnesiac. It should be able, using its working memory contents

21:22.160 --> 21:27.360
and so on, to produce plausible behavior. And you could still argue that this doesn't have an

21:27.360 --> 21:32.160
intrinsic motivation because it's just going to generate an arbitrary story about a robot based

21:32.160 --> 21:38.080
on stories about robots that have seen in the past because at some of the motivation into an

21:38.080 --> 21:44.240
external cybernetic module that has set point deviations and measures them and feed this into

21:44.240 --> 21:50.160
the prompt. So what this thing is doing is now generating a very complicated high-level story

21:50.160 --> 21:55.680
and it doesn't need to be a story that is limited to text. It could also have visual elements,

21:55.680 --> 21:59.760
it could have physical dynamics and so on because the transformer can learn all these things.

22:00.400 --> 22:05.440
So in some sense, it could generate a story about a conscious being that is similar as

22:05.440 --> 22:10.480
the story about a conscious being that's in our own mind. There's a basic difficulty that came up

22:10.480 --> 22:19.200
and I discussed this with my friend and colleague Tanja Greenberg. Do we know when a person appears

22:19.200 --> 22:22.960
in our own mind, for instance, during a dream at night, if we talk to that person in our dream,

22:22.960 --> 22:28.400
whether that other person that we imagine in our dream is conscious or not? And clearly,

22:28.400 --> 22:34.320
if we ask the other person, we might not get an answer that is true because if this thing is only

22:34.320 --> 22:39.120
a simulacrum that pretends to be conscious without being conscious and is just manipulated behind the

22:39.120 --> 22:46.400
scenes, how would we find out? On the other hand, I also know that I am an imaginary person that is

22:46.400 --> 22:50.720
imagined by my brain. It's a model that my brain has discovered about the state of affairs,

22:50.720 --> 22:57.120
about an organism in the physical world, but this model of consciousness is an entirely virtual

22:57.120 --> 23:03.120
story and I know that this story is not real. It's a figment of my imagination. And of course,

23:03.120 --> 23:07.920
there's also a continuum between characters that I imagine in my mind and myself because I can imagine

23:07.920 --> 23:13.920
myself to be that character. If I, for instance, write a book and I imagine a character in the

23:13.920 --> 23:18.560
book very intensely, then at some point I might find myself to be that character in the book where

23:18.560 --> 23:25.600
I suspend all my disbelief and this conscious being is not different from me. So basically,

23:25.600 --> 23:31.520
there is a pretty fuzzy area where it's hard to say whether an imaginary person is conscious or not.

23:31.520 --> 23:37.280
It's difficult to say. How does this work in biological systems? In biological systems,

23:38.000 --> 23:41.760
we don't use a technological design. They are designed in a very different way from

23:42.480 --> 23:48.320
the technological artifacts that we are building when we're writing computer programs or building

23:48.320 --> 23:54.320
machinery. In technological systems, we start out with an environment that is deterministic. We

23:54.320 --> 23:59.600
know how our workshop works. We know how our computer works. We start basically with some kind of a

23:59.600 --> 24:06.160
pretty much blank slate and then we decide what the functionality is by which we want to extend

24:06.160 --> 24:13.520
our world and then we design from the outside in and into the material and so on and force the

24:13.520 --> 24:18.880
material, the substrate, to produce exactly what we want to have. And biological and social systems

24:18.880 --> 24:24.560
are designed from the inside out with some kind of meta design. It basically means that you cannot

24:24.560 --> 24:28.720
rely on the determinism of the universe. You have to colonize your substrate first and

24:29.440 --> 24:33.760
extend your own functional principles and your determinism into the substrate before you can

24:33.760 --> 24:39.280
make it do what you want it to do. And basically, you have to, instead of realizing the functionality,

24:39.280 --> 24:43.280
build a system that wants to realize the functionality, that trans converges towards

24:43.280 --> 24:48.960
realizing that functionality. So a tree is not just a set of functions that realizes the transfer

24:48.960 --> 24:53.600
of nutrients from the roots to the leaves and photosynthesis and so on. But first of all,

24:53.600 --> 25:00.640
it starts out as a seed that is going to colonize the ground and the earth, the material around

25:00.640 --> 25:05.440
the seed is going to turn it more and more into a tree. And if you disturb that system by harming

25:05.440 --> 25:09.840
it and hurting it, you don't do it too much, so it gets destroyed a little bit, then it's going to

25:09.840 --> 25:15.600
grow back into a tree. And so it is something that is a proto tree and eventually converges into

25:15.600 --> 25:22.160
being a tree. And this thing needs to have some agency to make that happen. It needs to be a model

25:22.160 --> 25:28.000
of the future that is being achieved in the system. And biological neurons are agents in the sense

25:28.000 --> 25:36.080
as well, that designed the mind from the inside out, not from the outside in. Here you see a bunch

25:36.080 --> 25:42.560
of cortical red neurons that are filmed in the pitch petition. You see how they're trying to link

25:42.560 --> 25:51.120
up to each other and form some kind of organization. And we have something like 86 billion of these

25:51.120 --> 25:56.640
neurons in our brain. And they're organized in the neocortex in groups of something like 100 to

25:56.640 --> 26:03.280
400 neurons, which are cortical columns. And we have something in the ballpark of 100 million

26:03.280 --> 26:07.840
of these cortical columns. And I think of a cortical column as something as a state machine.

26:07.840 --> 26:12.480
There's a protocol that allows it to link up to the cortical columns around it. It's trained to be

26:12.480 --> 26:19.360
like this. And each of them approximates functions. And these functions play out in

26:19.360 --> 26:24.720
brain areas that are basically like something like an ether in which activation waves appear.

26:24.720 --> 26:30.240
And these activation waves represent the calculation of dynamic functions, which are

26:30.240 --> 26:35.680
features of different cognitive domains. And the brain areas are talking to each other

26:36.400 --> 26:42.000
and listening to each other and so on, form processing streams. And sometimes use the

26:42.000 --> 26:47.600
metaphor of a cortical orchestra where basically every brain area is somewhat akin to an instrument.

26:47.600 --> 26:53.040
And the different instruments are listening to what is being played in the environment. And they

26:53.600 --> 26:57.840
are taking up these things and complicating them and then passing them on to other instruments.

26:58.480 --> 27:06.320
And this orchestra is dealing at some of the outer fringes with sensory patterns and actuator

27:06.320 --> 27:11.680
patterns and then abstracts them into geometry and spatial structure and into generative

27:11.680 --> 27:17.920
simulations of the world and into conceptual abstractions and so on. And the entire thing is

27:17.920 --> 27:24.720
being attended by some conductor. And the conductor is not some CPU that sits inside

27:24.720 --> 27:30.320
of the brain, like the CPU sits inside of your computer and makes things happen,

27:30.320 --> 27:34.160
but it's an instrument like the others. And it can only listen to what the rest of the

27:34.160 --> 27:43.040
orchestra is doing very superficially. And its role is to make that orchestra coherent,

27:43.040 --> 27:49.120
to let it play a single thing at any given time and to remove inconsistencies between what the

27:49.120 --> 27:57.520
individual instruments are playing. And if the conductor uses the connection to the system at

27:57.520 --> 28:02.320
night when you dream, then the orchestra doesn't necessarily stop, but it can go into something

28:02.320 --> 28:08.960
like a free jazz mode, where it's no longer connected to an audience and the audience is dark

28:08.960 --> 28:14.320
because you are dissociated from your sensory apparatus at night when you dream. And so this

28:14.320 --> 28:19.280
thing is just spinning off. And sometimes it can become very incoherent, sometimes it's going to

28:19.280 --> 28:25.680
settle into a groove, but it's not going to generate a unified model of a universe that

28:25.680 --> 28:31.280
it's entangled with reality that it's connected to, that it tracks as it does during daytime.

28:31.280 --> 28:38.080
And this tracking of coherent reality seems to require some kind of government mechanism.

28:38.080 --> 28:42.480
This government mechanism emerges in the brain through some kind of a suspect new

28:42.480 --> 28:47.200
Darwinism. There is some kind of evolutionary competition between different organizations

28:47.200 --> 28:51.840
that your mind can have, and eventually the most stable one prevails. And this is your

28:52.800 --> 29:00.160
observing conscious self, an attention agent that is trying to make a coherent model of the world.

29:01.360 --> 29:07.520
And now can we can ask does GPT-3 have such a conductor? And I think that the attention

29:07.520 --> 29:13.120
model in the transformer looks a little bit like one, but it's not. So the new thing that GPT-3 had

29:13.120 --> 29:19.520
that previous neural network training mechanisms usually didn't have was the ability to pay attention

29:19.520 --> 29:24.880
to what it should learn. This means that in every layer in this neural network, there is going to

29:24.880 --> 29:29.200
be a model of what the previous layers, based on the current context, what data in the previous

29:29.200 --> 29:34.400
layer, what features in the previous layer should it pay attention to. And this self attention

29:34.400 --> 29:40.320
helps the network to learn basically its own structure and do statistics over and it makes

29:40.320 --> 29:45.040
it much, much more efficient and coherent. But it's not integrated over all the layers

29:45.040 --> 29:50.640
into one model of reality and so on. So this is not what's happening in GPT-3 yet. And maybe

29:50.640 --> 29:55.120
this is one of the reasons why it's so much slower in learning writing, so much more training data

29:55.120 --> 29:58.640
than a human being needs over the course of their life before it converges.

29:58.880 --> 30:06.480
And it's tempting to think that this such an integrated model of attention is something that

30:06.480 --> 30:10.720
has, for instance, been suggested by Marvin Minsky in his seminal book, Society of Mind,

30:10.720 --> 30:15.920
where you have basically look at the mind as a society of different agents. And there are some

30:15.920 --> 30:21.280
agents that are organizing the other agents into a coherent structure. And Minsky calls these agents

30:21.280 --> 30:29.280
K-lines, knowledge lines, and suggests that they form basically their own society and society of

30:29.280 --> 30:36.400
mind. And this society is forming something like a reflection of what's happening in the A-brain.

30:36.400 --> 30:43.120
The A-brain being our perceptual mind that is modeling the reality that we are tracking based

30:43.120 --> 30:48.720
on sensory and actuator input that the brain is entangled with and the B-brain is immersed

30:48.720 --> 30:52.400
into this perceptual reality and reflects on it and makes it more coherent.

30:53.200 --> 30:59.200
And there is a similarity between Kahneman's famous System 1 and System 2. It's not quite

30:59.200 --> 31:06.640
the same thing, but it's tempting to basically see the affair as a perception agent that is

31:06.640 --> 31:11.760
entangled with the environment and is getting valence from the motivational system that is

31:11.760 --> 31:17.040
basically cybernetic motivational architecture. And then you have an ancient agent that lives

31:17.040 --> 31:23.360
on top of the perceptual agent. And that is the conductor and has a memory of what it attends to

31:23.360 --> 31:30.640
so it can get the model to convert by some constructive process. And this attentional system,

31:30.640 --> 31:38.960
this conductor, here I've drawn it on top of the system. The top is a direction that basically

31:38.960 --> 31:43.120
seems to be obvious to the attentional system itself because it feels to be on top, but we

31:43.120 --> 31:47.600
know that you're not completely on top. There is stuff that is driven by the selves that we have

31:47.600 --> 31:52.640
not reversed and that we give a moment and that gives motivation to the attentional system to

31:52.640 --> 32:02.000
what it attends to. But our consciousness perceives itself as the observer of the mental and external

32:02.000 --> 32:07.840
states and the self-states of the model that is being discovered. And the purpose of the

32:07.840 --> 32:14.480
attentional system is to facilitate learning so we can converge to a model of reality

32:14.480 --> 32:21.440
and reasoning, which is basically real-time learning on imaginary mental states. And this idea

32:21.440 --> 32:26.560
that consciousness is a control model of our attention is not new. It's, for instance, been

32:26.560 --> 32:31.520
championed by Michael Graciano in the attention schema theory and it finds itself in one version or

32:31.520 --> 32:38.000
other in Eastern philosophies and in a lot of convergent ideas in cognitive science.

32:40.480 --> 32:44.480
Some people say that computers cannot be conscious because they are only physical

32:44.480 --> 32:53.760
mechanical systems and so they're not physical systems in the same way as the neurons are

32:53.760 --> 32:58.080
because neurons are entangled with the real world as dynamical systems and so on. They

32:58.080 --> 33:04.080
can do things that the simulation cannot do. And I think that Frisk of Cork maybe has it backwards.

33:04.080 --> 33:08.560
I think that physical systems cannot be conscious. Neurons cannot be conscious. Brains cannot be

33:08.560 --> 33:13.440
conscious because there are things happening in consciousness that are not physically possible.

33:14.160 --> 33:18.640
And the only thing that can be conscious is the simulation because consciousness is the

33:18.640 --> 33:25.760
simulated property. Consciousness is virtual. So you can only be conscious in a story that you

33:25.760 --> 33:32.800
tell yourself about yourself. And this means that our phenomenal consciousness is a virtual state.

33:32.800 --> 33:37.600
It only exists inside of the mental models. It's not attending to physical phenomena.

33:38.560 --> 33:46.160
It's attending to high-level features, things like colors and sounds and emotional expressions and so

33:46.160 --> 33:51.120
on. None of these are physical things, right? All these high-level abstractions that a learning

33:51.120 --> 33:55.520
system is generating in the interaction with the environment to make it predictable. And this

33:55.520 --> 34:00.880
phenomenal consciousness, this experience of what it's like to attend to features is an awareness

34:00.880 --> 34:06.160
of a partial binding state of our working memory. That's basically at the content at the interface

34:06.160 --> 34:11.280
between perception and reflection. And then we are aware of the mode in which we're using attention.

34:11.280 --> 34:16.320
So whether this is hypothetical or whether it's perceptual or whether it's a memory. And then

34:16.320 --> 34:21.440
the reflexive consciousness, this process that is attending, is aware that it's the process that

34:21.440 --> 34:28.000
is attending and the space acting based on that awareness. And the AI researcher at Russia Benjio

34:28.000 --> 34:33.840
said that consciousness is basically a function whose purpose is to create a big dip in the

34:33.840 --> 34:38.160
energy function that models reality. So it's basically a low-dimensional almost discrete

34:38.160 --> 34:43.760
function that is parameterizing the perception in such a way that it starts to make sense.

34:46.240 --> 34:50.800
Self and conscious are not the same thing. The self is a model of your agency

34:50.880 --> 34:55.760
that you discover. And you can be conscious without having the self. For instance, during

34:55.760 --> 35:01.520
dreams or meditation, you can turn off the self without losing consciousness. And the self is

35:01.520 --> 35:06.800
this discovery of the agent that the system is making about what it is. And it's downstream

35:06.800 --> 35:12.080
from the set point deviation. So the self is not motivating things, it experiences the motivation

35:12.080 --> 35:17.360
and begins to understand how the motivation works and thereby allows to reverse engineer the mind

35:17.440 --> 35:23.680
if the self is learning. And it shapes our own agency by identifying who we think we are at any

35:23.680 --> 35:29.280
given moment. And it allows to have a first-person perspective if the self is discovering that

35:29.280 --> 35:33.680
the contents of this control model are actually driving behavior. That makes it a very special

35:33.680 --> 35:38.880
agent. So in this sense, consciousness is a control model of attention. It allows the convergence

35:38.880 --> 35:42.720
of a coherent interpretation of the world, which is basically a low energy state of the model that

35:42.720 --> 35:48.000
attracts reality. And it maintains a memory for this aggregation. So that's why we have a stream

35:48.000 --> 35:52.480
of consciousness. Because when you construct, you need to remember what you tried and where

35:52.480 --> 35:56.720
you're coming from. And this is not true, for instance, for convergent learning mechanisms

35:56.720 --> 36:01.200
like neural network learning, but you don't need to remember where you came from. We just go to

36:01.200 --> 36:10.320
the next optimum and try to stay in that optimum. So is GPT being conscious? So we see three by

36:10.320 --> 36:15.200
itself is not an agent. And the transformer is also not a complete control model of attention,

36:15.200 --> 36:21.680
but only a very partial one. And on the other hand, current AI models can be extended beyond that.

36:21.680 --> 36:26.720
And they can create coherent stories about conscious agents. You can get GPT-3 to run very

36:26.720 --> 36:32.000
long in its simulation of what it's like to be a conscious agent. And we can ask ourselves,

36:32.000 --> 36:39.440
is GPT-3 simulating a conscious agent or is it just a simulacrum? And what does this mean?

36:39.440 --> 36:44.800
So the world is a decomposition that might mix of the universe into interacting separate

36:44.800 --> 36:49.600
objects, because the entire state vector of the universe is too complicated to model it. So you

36:49.600 --> 36:55.680
hack it up into separate disconnected subsystems. And the universe is not really made of separate

36:55.680 --> 37:00.800
disconnected subsystems. It's just a way in which we make it intelligible to us. And once you have

37:00.800 --> 37:05.520
these separate disconnected subsystems, and you model the interaction, you get causality.

37:05.520 --> 37:12.080
Causality is the interaction between separate objects. So causality is a side effect of the

37:12.080 --> 37:18.400
way in which we model the universe as separate objects. And the simulation can model causal

37:18.400 --> 37:23.440
structure on a different substrate. So for instance, a computer game is using a substrate that's

37:23.440 --> 37:28.800
very different from physics, very simplified computation that nevertheless gives results

37:28.800 --> 37:32.960
that are so similar to physics that you can recognize what's happening on the screen

37:33.040 --> 37:38.080
and manipulate the causal structure on the screen based on what you have observed before in the

37:38.080 --> 37:44.880
real world. So a 3D computer game is a simulation of the physical world. It's a very simplified

37:44.880 --> 37:50.160
simulation, but one that can be surprisingly convincing. And a simulacrum is recreating just

37:50.160 --> 37:54.480
the observables without causal structure. For instance, the movie is a simulacrum. You cannot

37:54.480 --> 37:59.760
causally interact with the movie. You can just observe it. And so a simulacrum basically can

38:00.400 --> 38:05.360
do magic. It can do an arbitrary thing without you having to understand the causal structure.

38:05.360 --> 38:09.680
And in the sense, a lot of instances where you experience our free will is not the causal

38:09.680 --> 38:15.520
structure, but it's a simulacrum. It's a stand-in for a causal structure in our own mind. And

38:15.520 --> 38:20.480
it's to me an open question, how much of my own consciousness is a simulation and how much is

38:20.480 --> 38:27.360
a simulacrum? So if an imaginary person in my own mind is sometimes conscious, it's not that easy

38:27.360 --> 38:33.040
to say whether GPT-3 or an extended version of GPT-3 that does a multi-model, it can also have

38:33.040 --> 38:38.560
perceptual content and so on, represented in it, qualifies as such an imaginary person that

38:38.560 --> 38:46.160
would be conscious. I think I am an imaginary person myself. I don't know to which degree I'm

38:46.160 --> 38:52.960
a simulation or a simulacrum. And it's not quite clear how well the AI models are dealing with

38:53.280 --> 39:00.960
this. So in summary, I find it's very counterintuitive to think of GPT-3 as being conscious. For me,

39:00.960 --> 39:06.720
it's surprisingly difficult to shoot down the idea that it is. And even though GPT-3 is clearly

39:06.720 --> 39:11.760
inferior in many ways to the way in which my own perception works and reasoning works and

39:11.760 --> 39:18.640
learning works, and there's many things that it cannot do so easily, I think it's not that easy

39:18.640 --> 39:24.960
to dismiss the idea that it is slightly conscious for brief moments during the inference when it

39:24.960 --> 39:30.080
has to build causal structure to simulate an imaginary person so it can tell me a story about it.

39:33.360 --> 39:41.360
Okay, let's stop here. That was great. That was fantastic. Let's say first of all that

39:41.360 --> 39:45.440
there has been a debate going on on the internet about this, that people have been sending me

39:45.440 --> 39:50.320
links to, and Jan LeCun responded to Ilya's comment. I don't know if you saw that, but

39:50.960 --> 39:55.280
his response is not even true for small values of slightly conscious and so on.

39:55.280 --> 40:01.120
Anyway, so there's a debate out there. And of course, last week we had David Chalmers here,

40:02.320 --> 40:08.400
who, as you probably know, there was an interview on GPT-3 with him, which is very convincing.

40:08.400 --> 40:13.120
And he kind of makes his comments similar to you, that he thinks it's kind of approaching

40:13.120 --> 40:19.040
something like consciousness. Anyway, one thing I wanted to mention is that we, in architecture,

40:19.040 --> 40:23.680
we haven't actually, I don't know anyone who's been using Glide, but Clip has been used to

40:23.680 --> 40:29.840
generate images, very successful actually, and using VQGAN. That's the technique that's become

40:29.840 --> 40:36.480
very popular and has produced some really quite shocking results that people are kind of,

40:36.480 --> 40:42.480
they're really taking pay attention to. So it is something that we're kind of getting into,

40:42.480 --> 40:47.840
and it's certainly part of that discussion. I've had discussions about GPT-3 on this forum,

40:47.840 --> 40:54.080
which have been interesting. I mean, the key question, obviously, is whether we are fully

40:54.080 --> 41:02.880
conscious of everything that we're doing. And I think that there's some level of things that

41:02.880 --> 41:08.800
are happening. I mean, to my mind, there are some automatic reflexes that we do. For example,

41:08.880 --> 41:13.280
you go to Japan, someone starts bowing at you. Automatically, you bow back. It's not as though

41:13.280 --> 41:17.360
you're really thinking about it. And then there are questions whether we have access to some of

41:17.360 --> 41:26.000
the processes that are going on, that are part of our actions. We simply maybe can't reach those

41:26.000 --> 41:31.440
points. So whether things are beyond us in some sense. So anyway, this debate is a very timely

41:31.440 --> 41:36.880
and very interesting one. I want to put up, you're about to show something?

41:37.840 --> 41:43.680
I just put up this slide again, because this is generated with, I think, clip in VQGAN on

41:43.680 --> 41:47.920
Vombo AI. I don't think that I've published how exactly they do it, but it looks like it.

41:47.920 --> 41:55.360
And I generated this as AI claiming the noble eightfold path.

41:57.360 --> 42:01.200
Yeah, maybe I can show you later on some of the stuff, because it is quite extraordinary what

42:01.200 --> 42:05.760
it can produce. And I would say that you actually have in the audience here some people who are

42:06.640 --> 42:10.800
have written about AI and architecture including myself. So it's kind of you've got an interesting

42:10.800 --> 42:15.760
informed audience here. One thing, there's just a general kind of comment, though, is, I mean,

42:15.760 --> 42:21.520
I really like the idea that you put forward that somehow you can learn about the self through

42:21.520 --> 42:27.280
looking at AI. Somehow, I mean, I don't know how you put it, but whether it becomes AI becomes a

42:27.280 --> 42:30.960
mirror and into the self, but whether we can understand human intelligence through looking

42:30.960 --> 42:37.600
at artificial intelligence. And that's a provocation. And I think there are some examples

42:37.600 --> 42:43.200
in computer science where we have learned about the natural world through computer models. I

42:43.200 --> 42:48.160
mean, I think that Craig Reynolds Boyds, for example, gave us a clue as how to birds actually

42:48.160 --> 42:52.640
flop. I think that's interesting. And so potentially, there is something there that is,

42:52.640 --> 42:57.440
and this is one of my primary interests, is how we can learn about human intelligence,

42:57.520 --> 43:03.200
the human mind through these things. But the big challenge that it seems that we have is that

43:03.200 --> 43:07.600
we're dealing essentially with two black boxes. You know, we don't know what's going on in the

43:07.600 --> 43:12.160
deep levels of a neural network, and we certainly don't know what's going on in the mind. And so

43:13.760 --> 43:20.880
how can you make, what can you say that isn't simply a form of speculation? I mean,

43:20.880 --> 43:26.240
you can't prove anything. It can simply become some kind of, you can speculate about something

43:26.240 --> 43:31.760
based on what appears to be the case in another scenario. What would you say about that coming

43:31.760 --> 43:36.000
from a kind of, let's say, a scientific background where you have a kind of burden of proof?

43:37.040 --> 43:42.960
Can you do more than that? Yes, first of all, neural networks are no longer black boxes. You

43:42.960 --> 43:50.800
know how neural networks work and largely also why. You can basically look into the neural networks

43:50.800 --> 43:54.400
and find out which parts of the neural networks are computing which functions.

43:55.120 --> 44:02.720
And a function is a mapping from inputs to outputs. And a function can be used to couple

44:02.720 --> 44:10.880
the previous inputs to future inputs to track reality. So in some sense, when you look at

44:10.880 --> 44:16.400
the patterns on your own retina, what you have there are little blips that appear on the retina

44:16.400 --> 44:24.240
whenever a retinal neural gets excited by photon sitting it. And what your brain is doing,

44:24.240 --> 44:29.040
it's discovering a relationship between these blips. The meaning of the blips is exactly

44:29.040 --> 44:35.280
the relationships that your brain discovers between the blips. And this makes them predictable.

44:35.280 --> 44:40.000
It puts them into a shared context, not just at the same time, you're not just processing

44:40.000 --> 44:44.960
lots of parallel blips that happen on your retina, but also across times. So across different scenes

44:44.960 --> 44:49.600
that you're observing at different moments in your life. And the relationships between

44:49.600 --> 44:54.000
the different blips on your retina that your brain discovers is that you are looking at

44:54.000 --> 45:01.360
moving blocks of color in a world that is moving relative to you. And these moving blocks of color

45:01.360 --> 45:09.120
are three-dimensional surfaces. And the surfaces are animated by some kind of physics. And they

45:09.120 --> 45:13.520
are also animated by some kind of agency that you sometimes observe, like people talking to

45:13.520 --> 45:18.560
each other and so on that have mental states, they exchange ideas, and they're being lit on

45:19.280 --> 45:25.920
by the sun. And all these relationships are functions. These functions are dynamical features

45:25.920 --> 45:30.960
that basically tell you how to get from one state of the world to other states of the world.

45:31.600 --> 45:36.480
And at this level of abstraction, this is something that our neural networks also can do.

45:37.360 --> 45:42.000
Where there are limitations is that the neural networks that we are currently using

45:42.000 --> 45:47.520
are often not learning in real time. They're not connected to the world and online learning.

45:47.520 --> 45:53.280
You know, this research does happen. And it's slower. And it's not as flexible in many ways as

45:53.280 --> 45:59.040
the learning happens in our own brain. And so the algorithms that we have discovered

45:59.680 --> 46:05.280
are not the best algorithms that could facilitate this. But it's also, on the other hand,

46:05.280 --> 46:11.360
not as clear to me what the limitations of these algorithms are. There are people like Gary Marcus

46:11.360 --> 46:18.640
who will tell you that it's very obvious that these systems cannot do X, but there is no proof

46:18.640 --> 46:24.400
that they cannot do this. Even if you have a very simple feedforward system that is only mapping

46:24.400 --> 46:30.640
inputs to outputs, what is to say if you connect this to a memory, is that it's not the transition

46:30.640 --> 46:35.120
function between adjacent brain states and is able to do everything that your brain is able to do

46:35.120 --> 46:39.680
if it just has memory to store parameters that it refers to the environment that modifies

46:39.680 --> 46:46.000
you to behavior. So it's very easy to build a system that is Turing complete. It's not easy to

46:46.000 --> 46:52.480
discover a function that is capable of universal learning efficiently. And so our machine learning

46:52.480 --> 46:57.600
models at the moment are not efficient in the sense that they learn as quickly as the logical

46:57.600 --> 47:02.640
nervous systems learn, but they do learn and they do converge to many of the functions that we require.

47:04.320 --> 47:08.640
Can I just share my screen a second because there was one that you touched on, which I thought was

47:09.600 --> 47:20.880
that this is simply a transcript of your discussion with Lex. And this one I've highlighted,

47:20.880 --> 47:27.360
I think it's really interesting and incredibly provocative sort of comment. So basically a

47:27.360 --> 47:32.960
brain cannot feel anything, a neuron cannot feel anything, their physical things, physical systems

47:32.960 --> 47:38.400
are unable to experience anything, but it would be very useful for the brain or for the organism

47:38.400 --> 47:43.200
to know what it would be like to be a person and to feel something. So the brain creates a

47:43.200 --> 47:48.400
simulacrum of such a person that it uses to model the interactions of the person. It's the best

47:48.400 --> 47:53.760
model of what that brain, this organism thinks it is in relationship to its environment. So it

47:53.760 --> 48:00.000
creates that model. It's a story, a multimedia novel that the brain is continuously writing and

48:00.000 --> 48:08.160
updating. I mean, I find this enormously provocative as a comment. And I think the

48:08.240 --> 48:13.680
idea that we're kind of creating a story that somehow gives meaning to something,

48:15.200 --> 48:21.360
it kind of reminds me in some sense of the way that Homi Barba talks about how a nation operates.

48:21.360 --> 48:25.840
I think Zizek says something similar. It's how things are inscribed within a story that people

48:25.840 --> 48:30.480
tell oneself. And I think that's important because in architecture we just focus on the object,

48:30.480 --> 48:35.600
but actually it's the way that object is inscribed within some subjective process that makes sense

48:35.680 --> 48:42.240
of things. But I just wonder whether, I mean, so to my mind, this is an incredibly provocative

48:42.240 --> 48:48.960
and controversial comment, it seems. Just maybe could you comment on the reception that this view

48:48.960 --> 48:56.720
has had with other people? Has it proved to be controversial? How else could it be? Do you have

48:56.720 --> 49:04.800
other theory that works that can explain what's going on? I think once I noticed that my

49:05.440 --> 49:12.400
own experience is virtual, that my memories are often created after the fact and modified under

49:12.400 --> 49:21.040
my nose without me noticing. Do you notice that you exist inside of a model? It's also that I'm not

49:21.040 --> 49:27.040
in physical time. My own self is sometimes a little bit ahead of the physical universe,

49:27.040 --> 49:36.080
sometimes a little bit behind. So the physical now and the experience now are different. And the

49:36.080 --> 49:41.040
elements of my perception are clearly not the elements in which physics is being implemented.

49:41.040 --> 49:46.960
Rather, it's the other way around. What I notice is that I do exist in a dream, very much like

49:46.960 --> 49:52.800
we usually say in idealist philosophy. But this dream needs to be created somehow. Something

49:52.800 --> 49:57.600
needs to construct the dream. And that's a brain and higher plane of existence. And this

49:57.600 --> 50:06.080
higher plane of existence is what we call physics. Maybe I'll stop sharing. The other comment that

50:06.080 --> 50:10.560
I find usually provocative that you make is which kind of relates also to the discussion. I don't

50:10.560 --> 50:17.440
know if you've seen David Chalmers' recently published book on reality plus, where he talks about

50:17.440 --> 50:23.440
virtual worlds. But you came up with a comment that what we are seeing is a virtual reality

50:23.440 --> 50:29.760
generated in the brain, which I'm actually very persuaded by myself. And I guess I'm thinking

50:29.760 --> 50:37.280
also of the kind of thinking of Anil Seth, who kind of talks about this controlled hallucination.

50:38.000 --> 50:43.040
And we kind of predict what's out there because we don't know. It seems that your work to some

50:43.040 --> 50:48.720
extent aligns with the work of Anil Seth, but at some points differently. I have to say that Anil

50:48.720 --> 50:52.160
is very fond of your work. So it's intriguing to kind of compare and contrast them.

50:56.000 --> 51:00.880
Because we had a discussion last week about whether we're living in a simulation and things,

51:00.880 --> 51:08.080
how would you position yourself in relation to David Chalmers' work from reality plus,

51:08.080 --> 51:12.800
his work on virtual worlds? I haven't read his recent book, so I cannot say.

51:13.520 --> 51:18.320
And I don't know what his main thesis is about virtual worlds.

51:20.400 --> 51:26.080
Okay. Well, I wouldn't want to speak on his behalf, but we had a discussion about it. I also

51:26.080 --> 51:30.720
wanted to just point out something as well, which I find intriguing. And that is the extent to which

51:30.720 --> 51:36.000
some of these speculations that are coming out of cognitive science kind of seemingly echo the

51:36.000 --> 51:41.040
world of psychoanalysis. Now, I know that a lot of cognitive scientists and neuroscientists hate

51:43.840 --> 51:49.280
psychoanalysis. I know that Anil Seth does, but there's an interesting comment that Slavoj Žižek

51:49.280 --> 51:56.080
has made about this, where if you take a Lacanian perspective, you don't engage with the real except

51:56.080 --> 52:05.920
of certain moments. And in a sense, the fantasy has become a constitutive of how you engage with

52:05.920 --> 52:10.720
the real. So you see the real through the lens of fantasy, through the lens of the imagination,

52:11.280 --> 52:16.720
which is very similar to what, in some ways, you're talking about. And he makes a comment

52:16.720 --> 52:23.600
in an essay that I published a long time ago in a book, and this is called From Virtual Reality

52:23.600 --> 52:28.560
to the Virtualization of Reality, which is basically saying that our reality is itself

52:28.560 --> 52:35.280
already virtualized. And I think what virtual reality therefore shows us is not how virtual

52:36.160 --> 52:46.240
reality shows us is not how virtual reality is, but rather how virtual reality itself is,

52:46.240 --> 52:51.040
which is very similar to your kind of thinking. And so what I find intriguing is that some of these

52:52.640 --> 53:00.320
speculations are echoing previous speculations about how the mind works. Have you engaged in

53:00.320 --> 53:06.960
any way with Žižek or the world of Lacanian psychoanalysis and its discussion about the real?

53:07.760 --> 53:14.320
And I sometimes read this, but I've never had the discussion with Žižek. I am not

53:14.320 --> 53:19.440
unsympathetic to this terminology. It's just the problem is that it doesn't allow me to make

53:19.440 --> 53:24.640
models that I can test. And this means I don't know whether these models are wrong. So it's

53:24.640 --> 53:30.160
basically a very useful way to generate stories that also give me a handle on reality in the sense

53:30.160 --> 53:35.760
that allow me to point at entities and to manipulate them in my mind. And sometimes it's very useful

53:35.760 --> 53:39.680
that you basically have an indexical model where you are separating the world into

53:39.680 --> 53:44.480
objects that are useful to you and you can manipulate them. But this decomposition doesn't

53:44.480 --> 53:50.080
need to be an accurate causal structure. So the criticism with psychoanalysis is not that the

53:50.080 --> 53:56.480
terminology is not useful to me. It's that psychoanalysis doesn't tell me how to build the mind

53:56.480 --> 54:01.040
and so I should say that it works and to compare different competing models of the mind and to see

54:01.040 --> 54:06.800
which one is better. To do this, I will need to automate the mind in a way. I need to reverse

54:06.800 --> 54:12.240
engineer what the mind is doing, the functions that the mind is applying to representational states

54:12.800 --> 54:18.240
and need to get this done to such a detail that this thing becomes my black. And then I can compare

54:18.240 --> 54:24.400
its functionality. I want to move on to the questions that are coming in. I want to invite

54:24.400 --> 54:29.200
people in the audience to comment as I want to make an observation and that is to say that

54:29.200 --> 54:33.040
in my own world, this is years ago, I was working on a kind of coming out of Freud and thinking about

54:33.040 --> 54:38.720
how you use model psychoanalysis and engaging with, actually in this case it was with the work of

54:38.720 --> 54:43.840
Walter Benjamin, I came across something that is uncannily similar, certainly in terms of the

54:43.840 --> 54:48.240
terminology used, whether we're talking about the same thing, I don't know. But let me just

54:48.240 --> 54:53.920
for a second just share you something which surprised me because when I heard

54:53.920 --> 54:58.800
Blazegoriyakos talking about models and modeling, it's also crucial to his way of thinking.

54:59.520 --> 55:03.200
It sort of seemed to echo this. I'm just going to simply just share this screen a second.

55:07.600 --> 55:15.040
Yeah, can you see that? It's the thing about, so the term that I'm always interested in is the

55:15.040 --> 55:20.080
term mymesis. I don't know if you know this term at all, but in Freud it's how you can,

55:20.160 --> 55:24.640
he talks about it initially when he talks about how in his book of jokes, how you can connect

55:24.640 --> 55:30.720
with someone who's a subject of a joke. Someone falling over a banana skin, for example, you

55:30.720 --> 55:37.280
somehow, you model yourself on that person recalling bodily memories of what it is to slip up and so

55:37.280 --> 55:42.160
on and so on. It's how you identify with the world. The term mymesis is a form of that,

55:42.160 --> 55:48.000
it's a form of modeling. But just I just want to read out some of the text here because it's so

55:48.000 --> 55:53.040
similar to this idea of models and modeling. And I know that the term can be taken out of context

55:53.040 --> 55:56.640
and have a completely different sort of meaning, so therefore it's a bit deceptive.

55:57.360 --> 56:02.000
Anyway, to just understand the meaning of mymesis in Benjamin, we must all recognize its origin,

56:02.000 --> 56:06.960
the process of modeling, of making a copy of. In essence, it refers to an interpretive process

56:06.960 --> 56:12.240
that relates either to the modeling oneself on an object or to making a model of that object.

56:12.240 --> 56:17.120
Likewise, mymesis may come into relation as a third party engages that model with that model,

56:17.120 --> 56:20.400
and the model becomes a vehicle for identifying with the original object.

56:20.400 --> 56:25.840
In each case, the aim is to assimilate to that object. Mymesis, anyway, so it's going on about

56:25.840 --> 56:32.320
this question about, so it's a concept that has been used in psychoanalysis. And I don't know,

56:32.320 --> 56:38.160
there's a risk that one can simply take a term, which has a completely different meaning in

56:38.160 --> 56:42.720
different contexts and apply it. But I do think that the concept, the model, is a fascinating one.

56:42.720 --> 56:48.800
And I'm intrigued by the fact that you, alongside Blaze, and I think alongside also Jeff Hawkins,

56:48.800 --> 56:52.640
use that model as a way of opening up these questions.

56:53.920 --> 56:58.800
An issue with this type of language is that usually the understanding that it generates

56:58.800 --> 57:03.600
at least doesn't converge. That's the general issue with continental philosophy.

57:04.960 --> 57:10.400
Somebody recently asked on Twitter what the difference is between continental and analytical

57:10.400 --> 57:16.480
philosophers. And I somewhat flippantly responded that an analytical philosopher

57:16.480 --> 57:21.840
is one who understands that the difficult and hard questions of philosophy need to be

57:23.600 --> 57:32.400
answered with formal models. Whereas continental philosophers don't think that this is necessary,

57:33.520 --> 57:38.800
because they are literally genre that is looking down on analytical philosophers.

57:39.680 --> 57:44.400
You can see the difference between analytical philosophy and continental philosophy in,

57:44.400 --> 57:48.800
for instance, the treatment of Goethe's incompleteness proof. A proper analytical

57:48.800 --> 57:54.880
philosopher who had a formal education will understand that this is a proof about certain

57:54.880 --> 58:00.080
properties of formal languages, and specifically it proves that stateless formal languages that

58:00.080 --> 58:05.280
assume that truth exists independently of the process by which you get to prove

58:05.360 --> 58:12.080
don't lead to consistent models of the domain. And there are also related results, for instance,

58:12.080 --> 58:17.680
that a system cannot make statements about affairs outside of itself. So when you want to

58:17.680 --> 58:24.000
talk about the world in a formal system, you need to create a model of that world, and you can only

58:24.000 --> 58:28.240
talk about that model. You cannot talk about anything outside of the models that you are creating.

58:29.040 --> 58:36.400
And to continental philosopher, the Goethe's proof is more or less often understood as a

58:36.400 --> 58:41.360
statement of mathematicians that prove that mathematics is important at getting a handle

58:41.360 --> 58:46.480
on reality, and therefore the only way you can get a handle on reality is by not knowing mathematics,

58:46.480 --> 58:49.520
which gives the continental philosopher a clear advantage.

58:50.320 --> 58:55.120
I cannot hear you. You are muted.

58:56.960 --> 59:00.720
That was a great answer. Thank you. We've got some questions. Now, I have a third series of further

59:00.720 --> 59:03.840
questions that I'd like to ask. Maybe I could ask you one question before we go into the other

59:03.840 --> 59:08.240
questions. And that is, I mean, are you writing a book about this? I mean, is it being put down

59:08.240 --> 59:12.240
in some documented form? Because it would be incredibly useful if it were.

59:12.960 --> 59:18.560
You are right. I need to write a book about this. I have a large number of notes on stuff that needs

59:18.560 --> 59:24.080
to go into the book, but I also have a job and I have kids that are homeschooled and I have ADHD.

59:24.080 --> 59:29.920
So I need to go into a different phase of my life to have long interrupted, uninterrupted sessions for

59:29.920 --> 59:34.240
writing long phone texts. But if you're bad about not having written the book yet.

59:35.440 --> 59:42.720
Well, I think that a popular form of communicating ideas. So there is material out there,

59:42.720 --> 59:46.160
but I just think it could be assembled into an engine. Yes, it needs to be assembled. I feel

59:46.160 --> 59:51.840
better if it is being assembled and not just existing as various disconnected conversations.

59:51.840 --> 59:55.920
Yeah, I just, I mean, even Jeff Hawkins, I mean, my Jeff Hawkins book, I think is fabulous. But

59:55.920 --> 59:59.920
what's interesting is there are no footnotes in it. He's just kind of speculating. But

59:59.920 --> 01:00:04.720
nonetheless, he's putting his ideas down there. And it's really incredibly useful to have that

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:09.760
kind of commentary. So anyway, look forward to the book. I want to just ask this Matt Gorebay,

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:16.480
who's got a question in the chat, whether Matt is a graduate of MIT Media Lab. He's

01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:22.880
a doctoral design student right now at FIU. Matt, would you like to ask your question?

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:28.880
Sure. Yeah, thanks for all of this. It's really interesting. Perhaps the book could be co-authored

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:34.320
by GPT-3, make it faster to, you know, just to give GPT-3 the agency over the first draft.

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:40.160
I was asking, speaking of agency, I mean, the question I have is about motivation. It's about

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:44.800
sort of the high level motivations. When you ask, when you ask GPT-3, are you conscious? And then

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:51.680
it responds somewhat convincingly. It still isn't initiating that conversation. And so

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:56.560
one of, I mean, kind of in listening to everything you were saying, and you said something about

01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:02.160
when you were talking about trees and seeds, I love the thing about, instead of realizing

01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:06.160
the functionality, you want to build a system that wants to realize the functionality, you want

01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:10.000
to build the thing that wants to become a tree. But that question of wanting and motivation,

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:16.640
how does one, at what point does that get put into the system? Like at what point does the system

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:27.200
become curious or self-motivated to do things that we didn't necessarily ask of it? And I think maybe

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:31.920
related to that, I don't know, I'll let you go on this, but maybe related to that, the question

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:40.480
of individuation and sort of inter-subjectivity, like, you know, has GPT-3 spoken to, are there

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:44.480
communities of GPT-3 all talking to each other about what they want to do and how do they individuate?

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:50.080
Or is GPT-3 just always the same and its clones of itself? If you could speak to any of that,

01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:54.720
that'd be great. Thank you. Yes. So that's the question, are we doing something that the organism

01:01:54.720 --> 01:02:02.400
is not asking of us? And that's not an easy question to answer. If you look at our own

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:09.600
motivation, I think that we have a few hundred physiological drives for different nutrients,

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:13.600
for instance, sometimes we want to eat salty food, sometimes we want to have sweet food,

01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:17.920
sometimes we need something to drink, sometimes we need to rest, and all these can be understood

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:23.440
as set-point deviations. And to deal with all of them, we need to create a dynamic model of our

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:28.960
needs projected into the future and then plans and higher-level models of these

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:33.760
needs, which we could call purposes and so on. We don't just have physiological needs,

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:38.560
we also have social needs, for instance, a need to affiliation to become part of a group,

01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:44.640
for instance, and to be accepted by it. Some people have a need for status to raise up in the group.

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:51.680
There are romantic needs, which can be courtship modes or a need for intimacy and so on. And then

01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:56.480
next to about a dozen of these social needs, we have a handful of cognitive needs, a need to

01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:05.440
become more competent, become efficacious on the environment, a need to reduce uncertainty,

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:10.160
and something that I would call a need for aesthetics, which means discovering deep

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:15.760
structure in the world. And aesthetics can be split into stimulus-oriented aesthetics, so we

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:20.320
are intrinsically wired to like certain body schemas over others, certain landscapes over others,

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:24.320
and there are evolutionary reasons for that. And then there are some mathematical principles,

01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:29.360
what kind of representations we like, what form means to have a good representation of something

01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:36.800
that are more general. And if we use meditation to disassemble our own needs and to dissociate

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:42.480
from them, we realize that the things that give us pleasure and pain do fall in these categories.

01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:48.240
So we have lots of these impulses that are about hunger and thirst and rest and so on,

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:52.960
and we have impulses that are about the social domain, and the older we get, the more these

01:03:52.960 --> 01:04:00.240
impulses get replaced by a deeper model of what we want the world to be like, and we act on this

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:09.840
deeper model and digest these reflexes. And on the lowest level, when you try to get more enlightened,

01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:15.360
you may have just something left that people often call love, which is, I think, a need to

01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:19.760
transcendentally connect to other agents and share purposes, that might act on these shared

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:24.880
purposes, but you can get deeper than this. And the deepest level, you only have aesthetics,

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:30.480
the need to form structure and to make the world intelligible, to create a coherent model of

01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:37.600
reality. And this need, I think, is similar to what Friston describes in the free energy principle,

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:43.200
it's basically predictive coding, it's the attempt to track reality using a model that is as good as

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:48.160
possible, that tracking reality. And if you turn off this aesthetic need, in addition to all the

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:55.680
others, my own mind becomes fuzzy, I fall asleep, I drift away, because if I stop paying my neurons

01:04:55.680 --> 01:05:01.200
for producing order in the universe, and they stop doing this, then nothing else is happening in my

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:07.840
mind that I can observe, and I just lose coherence. So if we imagine this hierarchy of needs, which

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:12.640
by itself, and seen as a cybernetic system, is not all that complicated, we can build this into a

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:17.360
machine, I think it's not that difficult. The difficult part is to get perception right, to get

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:23.840
ability to model reality in the universal base, you can have one coherent model of everything

01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:28.560
that you relate stuff to, when we talk about meaning, we talk about how to relate an arbitrary

01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:33.600
feature or domain or idea or concept to this unified model of reality that we are building each

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:41.760
work once in our own mind. Can I just pick up on a question, we've got another question

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:46.640
lined up, but let me ask you one quickly. You come from a creative background, your father was an

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:53.600
architect, and you refer to let's say creative practices of the orchestra and so on, it's part

01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:58.160
of what you're talking about, and frankly, your way of thinking is incredibly creative, it strikes

01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:03.040
me as being very creative. I wonder, you haven't mentioned the word creativity, I don't think,

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:09.680
and how do you view creativity, is it just a myth or is it something, how could you conceptualize it

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:16.640
within your framework? I think of creativity as the ability to bridge discontinuities in the search

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:21.520
space, and you are just following the gradient, and when you're just going through a continuous

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:26.800
search space, I don't think that you are creative, you just arrive at the state of the art, and even

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:32.800
the state of the art is something that hasn't been done before, if you just combine what is known

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:37.760
and you find a local optimum in the known things, you're not being creative. To be creative, you

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:43.680
need to construct a new search space usually, and many methods in which you can be creative, for

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:50.720
instance, you can use random serendipity, you can use some evolutionary process that is combining

01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:56.720
elements in ways that you are unaware of, and then discover structure in them. Creativity is, in some

01:06:56.720 --> 01:07:02.160
sense, about jumping off from the known things into darkness and hoping that you end up landing on

01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:10.000
the other side. So it's related to a search. Let me just put this to you then. Do you think that,

01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:14.560
because you mentioned this before in your discussions, but do you think Move 37 in Game

01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:22.880
2 of AlphaGo, was that creative? Could you call that creative? I don't think that AlphaGo is

01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:31.200
creative in the sense, because what AlphaGo is, well, there are evolutionary methods in AlphaGo,

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:36.240
and the outcome of what AlphaGo is arriving at is not always predictable. And it's also

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:42.880
computationally irreducible in the sense that you cannot foresee what AlphaGo was doing. AlphaGo

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:48.960
was able, in a relatively short amount of time, to demonstrate that human go play, which existed

01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:56.240
for thousands of years, was not optimal. It has discovered strategies that encounter the established

01:07:56.240 --> 01:08:02.240
strategies and goal. And in this sense, from the perspective of a human go player, it was playing

01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:08.960
in a creative way. It just discovered new things that had not been discovered before. But if you

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:15.520
will run AlphaGo multiple times, it's always going to discover these things. And so the search is,

01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:23.040
while it has stochastic elements, as a deterministic outcome. And I think that when we look at systems

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:28.080
like this, our notion of creativity is kind of sort of falls apart. But creativity is not

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:32.960
absolutely a thing in the universe. It sometimes is a frame that is useful to describe what's

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:39.280
happening. And sometimes this frame falls apart. Let me just put a provocative comment to you,

01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:43.680
then. I mean, something that I thought myself, and I would like to know what you think of this.

01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:50.000
So if GPT-3, if AlphaGo is not creative, and I kind of, in many ways, I don't think it is

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.560
creative, it's just doing a very, very effective search. But then we could ask this question about

01:08:54.560 --> 01:09:00.480
whether human beings are creative, or whether this term... Exactly. That's my issue, right? So

01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:05.920
sometimes your terms start meaning things. They mean something in a certain context, but when you

01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:11.600
increase the resolution too much, this context falls apart and no longer makes sense. And you use

01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:17.680
lose your term. And I have the same issue with the term like nemesis. But I like it. It's poetic.

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:23.360
It is evocative. It produces stuff in your mind. But when you zoom in very hard, it's not clear

01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:32.240
what it means. And so instead, I try to examine the assumptions that are hidden in nemesis. For

01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:37.760
instance, the idea that others exist independently of you, and yet you are able to take them in

01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:43.200
somehow instead of constructing them. And then the question, what's first, the model of the other,

01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:48.400
or the model of yourself? And whether it's the same thing in every person that becomes conscious.

01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:54.480
This is not obvious to me. And the notion of nemesis presupposes too much. And that makes me

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:59.920
unsympathetic to it. So even though I appreciate the poetic illusions that are there in the space

01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:04.400
that the term like this opens and the ability to converse about it, ultimately, I need to

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:10.800
deconstruct the term before I can use it. Okay, so let me just put... I'm glad you take this position.

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:16.480
But we just throw an idea at you. So, I mean, one of the analogies that I've made in the past

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:22.720
is to say that... Use the term magic at one point. Actually, I don't think that magic exists. I mean,

01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:29.760
I think that what happens basically is if you take the example I always give, if you have a magician

01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:34.000
at a kid's show, and they're pulling a rabbit out of a hat or something or doing magic,

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:40.000
the magician's not doing magic. The magician is simply concealing the operations at work

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:44.960
and making you believe that it is magic. And I'm just wondering whether we couldn't take that same

01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:49.520
notion and apply it to creativity, because we don't understand the processes. We just look back

01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:55.120
and say, wow, that's creative. Like some people said the same with AlphaGo, that's creative.

01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:58.480
But maybe it's not. It's just simply we don't understand the process. Therefore,

01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:01.920
maybe even the term creativity is not a very productive term in the first place.

01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:08.480
Yeah, I suspect that magic also in order to make sense, we need to understand what the term means.

01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:13.440
We need to completely deconstruct it into its constituents and then put it back together and

01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:18.480
see if we still have magic or if this term can still be recovered. And typically,

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:27.200
I see magic as the ability to get right access on the laws of reality. And if you think about

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:32.560
what it means in the naive form is the departure from the mechanical universe. The universe that

01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:38.960
we are in, according to the theory of physicalism, emerges over a causally closed lowest layer.

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:43.680
And this causally closed lowest layer is basically whatever mechanics is making the

01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:49.920
universe happening. And ultimately, there is going to be some natural layer where things are just

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:56.480
happening without some conscious intervention. And the idea of magic is that our universe somehow

01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:05.280
is a conspiracy, that there is a way to subvert the laws of the mechanical universe using symbolic

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:10.880
powers, that you have symbolic causality. And symbolic causality is, for instance, the connection

01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:17.040
that exists between sacrificing a black cat and celestial events that are caused by this.

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:22.720
Right. And this, this is something that cannot possibly be explained by any known physical

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:27.760
mechanism, because the elements of this transaction only have meaning in a symbolic

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:34.160
realm to a human mind that is acting based on a certain high level story and abstraction that

01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:37.840
is not a good depiction of what happens in the physical reality. It doesn't mean that the story

01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:44.720
is wrong. It's just not one about the frame of physics. In computer games, there is magic happening

01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:49.600
relative to the computer game, right? You can use Minecraft. And in Minecraft, there is a mechanical

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:54.480
layer where everything happens by itself, but you can also call up a shell and enter a time-set

01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:59.520
day in the sunrises. And this interaction somehow breaks the logic. And if you could do such a thing

01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:06.560
in our world, if you can use a ritual to make the sunrise, then you would subvert the physical

01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:13.440
reality. But what you can subvert is the psychological reality and the social reality.

01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:19.360
And in this form, magic does exist. If you get right access on somebody else's perception

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:25.200
and attention and memory and imagination, you can change their reality in any way you want.

01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:30.880
And in our culture, there are some norms against this or there used to be norms against it.

01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:36.880
And I think that in Christianity, this didn't exist. It was legitimate to subvert the reality

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:44.400
of other people by telling them, here is an omnipotent agent that is part of reality,

01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:48.560
therefore needs to be modeled in your own mind. And omnipotence means it knows everything that

01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:53.600
is to be known as full read access to your mind. And omnipotence means it has full write access.

01:13:54.160 --> 01:14:00.000
And also, we have a backdoor to this thing. Every week, you can get an update and we tell you

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:05.040
what this agent is going to do to your mind. And as a result, you have people that remember

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:11.360
having seen miracles, because something has rewritten the mental structure of their own mind.

01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:18.480
And you often find patterns of this in ideologies. So this idea that somebody else gets right access

01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:24.560
on your own minds, for instance, an innocent example is, here are my pronouns. And these

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:29.360
pronouns are not what you perceive. They are what I want you to perceive. And I have the right to

01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:36.160
change your mental representation. That's a form of magic. And I think that the idea that this

01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:41.920
is happening is because the people who propagate these ideas don't believe in the individual

01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:47.760
autonomy of individual minds to create realities and having a good outcome. You need to control the

01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:55.440
realities that minds create together by using magic to get the psychological realities of

01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:58.400
individuals to converge to the desired social reality.

01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:09.600
One of the things I find interesting in your thinking is the role of, well, you use the term

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:14.000
ideology, use the term religion. But to my mind, they could be seen more in the realm of myth.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:20.080
I mean, there's a lot of this space. And the way that you use the term actually also reminds me

01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:27.360
of the work of Zizek. I mean, he makes a comment. He read a book about love at one point. And

01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:33.360
he came to the conclusion that love is the myth that fills the gap between the self and the other.

01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:39.280
And somehow myth has been some structuring device by which you look at things where it

01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:44.240
conditions your understanding of reality a bit like ideology or in a bit like religion. Is that

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:51.520
something that you would engage with? I would engage with it. But I think that love is a more

01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:58.400
concrete meaning. Love is the discovery of shared sacredness. And sacredness are the purposes above

01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:05.760
the ego, the purposes to which we are willing to sacrifice ourselves. This has to do with being

01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:10.800
part of a transcendental agent. Not everybody has that. If you are a sociopath, you will not

01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:16.000
have purposes above the ego. And so you will be incapable of love because you will not have shared

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.880
purposes above the ego. You might have romantic infatuation. But ultimately, you are not going

01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:26.400
to build shared agents with others for non-transactional purposes because you share purposes with them.

01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:33.920
So love is this discovery of shared purposes. But I mean, but can you use the term shared? I mean,

01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:38.640
how do we ever know the other? How do we ever accept the other? We can think that we're sharing

01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:44.320
things, but are we actually sharing things? We do this in the same way as we know ourselves.

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:49.760
These are model creations. The other is a story that we are creating about a certain state of

01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:54.400
affairs in the world. It's in this sense not objectively true, but it's a model that allows

01:16:54.400 --> 01:17:00.080
you to predict reality better than other models that are competing with it. No, interesting response.

01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:07.920
So, Gustavo, maybe Gustavo is a postdoc at UC Santa Barbara. Gustavo, would you like to

01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:20.560
ask a question? Sure. Thank you very much for the wonderful talk. I think I want to kind of

01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:27.440
build on Matt's question a little bit, but more specifically to the idea of understanding

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:37.360
how computational systems are, let's say, evolved and programmed at the scientific level. Like,

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:46.720
what is the state of the art in modeling either psychological states or understanding how different

01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:54.480
models are building on knowledge where computational models can make creative leaps?

01:17:54.560 --> 01:18:01.680
So, if it's not clear, I'm thinking about in the history of human society, they're different models

01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:07.280
of control, the models of narrative, you know, they're different, either religions or different

01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:14.960
belief systems, but in the models of science, it seems as though that there is a building of

01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:26.400
knowledge and that we're moving toward an end. So, where we will never, as an example, we right

01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:33.200
now won't live to the end of the universe, but there is a goal in science that we as human beings

01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:42.320
need to propagate outside of our, you know, cosmos, so we have a chance to exist, and we have multiverses.

01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:50.800
How does, how do these computational models either aid humanity or are we looking at these

01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:59.440
computational models to exceed humanity in some way? And what does that mean? I'm thinking about

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:05.440
that edge that you're talking about, because I think a lot of what we talked about in humanity

01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:13.360
are black boxes. If you talk to a physicist or, or a mathematician, or an electrical engineer,

01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:21.440
they get to a point where we don't know the science. What are your thoughts about that? How do,

01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:26.800
how do we build better systems? Or how do we interact with these systems a little bit more

01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:33.040
ethically or morally? So they're not like psychopathic or anyway, maybe that's a little

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:40.480
too abstract. It's just, you brought a lot of higher level, a lot of knowledge here. So it's,

01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:47.760
it's very sobering is what I'm saying. Sorry about that.

01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:58.560
Don't be sorry. But I do welcome sobriety if it emerges. I think that you made some very

01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:07.440
interesting points or arrived at interesting pointers. You saw some images that I presented

01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:15.520
earlier, for instance, the generative art of glide and the text that GPT-3 is producing. And in some

01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:22.240
sense, this is the state of current computational creativity. And I think that the problem of how

01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:28.720
to make a technological system creative is solved. So they, these images are in some sense creative

01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:35.200
solutions, because they are able to bridge certain discontinuities in a certain space by finding

01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:40.480
solutions that people might have difficulty to find. So, for instance, if you have a conversation

01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:46.960
with GPT-3, it's usually better than what you get from a person that doesn't know the domain,

01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:50.960
but worse than the person that knows the domain. Well, for instance, you have a conversation with

01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:56.000
Hannah Arendt. And if you haven't read a lot of Hannah Arendt, it's really surprising and very

01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:00.400
convincing. But if you're very familiar with Hannah Arendt and have thought about her a lot,

01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:04.320
then you might notice some things that you probably wouldn't have said.

01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:12.480
And a similar thing is with our depictions of art and so on. So it's able to produce

01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:18.720
certain styles and reproduce them. But there is a certain thing that is missing. And I think that

01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:25.120
what GPT-3 cannot do yet, and the systems cannot do yet, is art. And the difference between art and

01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:32.800
creativity is subtle. Art, I think, is the capturing of conscious states, of a conscious

01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:41.040
reality, of some aspect of a conscious reality. And this means meaningful references to a unified

01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:48.240
model of the universe. And these models do not have a unified models of the universe yet.

01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:51.840
They don't understand which universe they are part of or think that they are part of.

01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:57.760
And while they are slowly getting there, I don't think that they are there yet. So to me,

01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:04.160
the digital art that you're seeing is not actually art, because it does not mean very much to the

01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:11.760
system. But it's something that humans can, at this point, relate to their shared reality sometimes

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:18.640
and onto their inner reality. And this makes them akin to art. And there is basically a

01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:24.640
porous boundary that is more and more dissolving in terms of AI and art in these days.

01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:34.800
So I don't think that there are fundamental unsolved problems at this point. But the biggest

01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:39.600
important problem is how to get a system that is able to track reality in real time

01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:43.840
and that can online learning. And a lot of people are working on this and we don't know

01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:47.840
how long it'll take to solve it. But it's not that it's a principle unsolvable.

01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:53.280
Can I just pick up on that, the question of art, because I think the back of my mind,

01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:59.840
there's an interesting kind of question coming up here in terms of, well, let me just throw out

01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:04.880
to you an idea, because you used the conductor metaphor and the music was part of the discourse.

01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:13.200
And I often speculated whether how creative we are as architects or indeed how artists are

01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:17.920
in the sense that there is a canon, there is a canon of architecture or art or whatever it was.

01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:22.320
And what we do is normally keeping broadly within that canon, you're very much aware of what other

01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:26.480
people have done. You might push the boundary slightly. And this is kind of what I think,

01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:31.840
I use the term jazz as a kind of idea of understanding how we operate as a background

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:36.320
condition. And we're feeding off it and just nudging the boundaries, but staying recognizably

01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:40.000
within the canon of this. And it's interesting that, I don't know if you know the work of

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:47.920
Ahmed Agamal, the guy who created these, who designed creative gans that he's a computer

01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:53.040
scientist who has a, who generates art. And the logic is this, you've got to keep broadly within

01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:57.520
the framework of what you're talking about within the canon of, let's say, modernist art,

01:23:57.520 --> 01:24:01.520
but make it slightly different. So you're just pushing the boundaries. So I know I often

01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:08.720
wonder to what extent we're so conditioned by what has been done before. And whether we,

01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:13.440
if you would do something genuinely different, you'll be outside the realm of what is acceptable

01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:22.000
within that genre. I would make a difference distinction between art and design. And architecture

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:28.080
for the most part is not art, but design. It's also true for myself. I'm for the most part not

01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:34.640
an artist, but a designer. And design is instrumental to something. Whereas art is

01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:39.840
instrumental to consciousness only, I think, at least the aspects of the thing that you're producing

01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:44.320
that are art, the other aspects and every artifact that you are producing, almost everyone,

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:51.520
the design serves some other purpose than the consciousness itself. For instance, if you are

01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:57.280
designing a building, you are serving a function of a human being that needs to have a house somewhere

01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:01.440
that needs to live down somewhere, this thing needs to be part of an environment and it requires

01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:07.360
deep perception. And it does require capturing some of your observations and the deep level. So there

01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:14.000
is important elements of seeing and perceiving and observing and reflection in architecture.

01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:19.760
But all these elements are ultimately instrumental to the thing that you're going to build. And the

01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:25.920
thing that you're going to build is defined by its function. Maybe I could just throw something out

01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:32.880
there. And let's say that could you not, as an architect, always think about these things. And I

01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:36.400
think almost there are two sides of, well, there are two sides of architecture, one's a functional

01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:40.800
side of thing, or dealing with the logistics. If you're dealing, let's say, with a very

01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:47.120
complex urban condition, you need to fit a building in somewhere, it becomes almost like a kind of

01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:51.440
simple search question of how do you find the best solution. And then there is this kind of, I

01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:55.840
wouldn't say a veneer, but there is an aesthetic side of things. So when it comes to, let's say,

01:25:55.840 --> 01:26:00.880
the strategic planning of how you might fit a building in a site or how it might operate and so

01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:06.160
on, it kind of relates more to the kind of logical, let's say, of AlphaGo, the strategy of AlphaGo.

01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:09.760
And then there's something else that we, as architects, want to put on top of that, which is

01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:16.160
more the kind of the artist dimension, which is giving it a certain aesthetic. Does that sound

01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:21.360
to make sense to you, that logic? Yes, it does. But there's, of course, the practical element

01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:28.240
that the aesthetic that the architect has when it's a successful one is a brand. And it's not

01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:35.040
driven by a free exploration of the conscious states of the architect for the most part, but

01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:40.640
it's driven by the anticipation of reward in a particular economic and cultural domain.

01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:44.240
And so in a sense, it's usually a construction process.

01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:52.640
Let me throw out another kind of thought then. I mean, what is interesting is when you get someone

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:57.440
who's fairly radical, like, I don't know, Frank Gehry, for example, he produces a building,

01:26:57.440 --> 01:27:01.360
the Guggenheim and Bilbao, really changed architecture, but then he kind of repeats

01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:05.600
himself in some senses. He's doing similar versions of that, and you must have seen the LA,

01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:15.200
the Philharmonic in LA, the Walt Disney concert hall. And it's almost like we have these patterns

01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:22.000
of behavior or signatures, I would say, that are recognizable. And now you see a Gehry building,

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:26.960
you say, that's Gehry. So it's almost like we're pieces on a chess board, and we have certain

01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:31.840
conditions, and we actually are constrained by that. So whether you see it as a brand or not,

01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:37.360
but it could be seen as a brand, we are constrained by our own signatures. And in fact, we end up

01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:43.120
not being so creative because we fit in with that logic. How does that sound to you?

01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:48.400
Ultimately, it's about intention. And the intention is either the submission to an

01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:56.400
external cultural mind, or the intention is an autonomous one. And I personally see art as

01:27:56.400 --> 01:28:01.920
something that is driven autonomously, and that's different from the definition of the art market.

01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:09.360
So the art market is only capturing a very small part of the arts. And a lot of the things that

01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:16.640
are happening on the art market are not art. And my own father is an architect who has defected

01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:23.920
from architecture and become an artist. So I am a child of an artist family. And my wife is an

01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:30.560
artist. And the difference between the art that my father is doing and the architecture that he

01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:37.680
has been doing is that the architecture is serving others in a particular role for in a

01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:44.400
particular cultural context and economic and social and societal context. And my father didn't

01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:49.920
want to submit to this societal context and this psychological and social context because he thought

01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:55.280
it was deeply unesthetic to him. We rejected the aesthetics of the society that he was in.

01:28:55.280 --> 01:29:00.960
So we removed himself from the society that he was in, bought a watermelon in the countryside

01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:07.200
and turned this into his own kingdom. And this kingdom is open for others to visit and explore.

01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:12.960
But it's not done for them. It's done for itself. It's done in the service of his own aesthetics.

01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:20.320
And to him, it doesn't really matter whether others like these aesthetics. This doesn't change

01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:26.480
how he thinks about the things that he's creating himself. He may need economic success to be able

01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:32.000
to survive and it might frustrate him if people don't like what he's doing. And it might frustrate

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:37.360
him the things that he might have to do to survive. But his own definition is that he is not

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:42.240
for himself, of his own intention, that he is not serving an external aesthetics.

01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:47.440
He is an autonomous agent. He is deeply autonomous. He is the creator of his own universe.

01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:53.360
No, it's a beautiful story that I've got a question coming in from Shamene in the chat.

01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:56.160
But can I ask you one quick question before we go on to that? And that's to say,

01:29:56.960 --> 01:30:01.600
the term architecture gets used, obviously, both for computer science and for architecture itself.

01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:07.440
And I'm just wondering, I mean, I don't know, my definition of the architect is very broad. I

01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:12.240
mean, I think it's a way of kind of, I would say that probably what your father is doing is probably

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:16.720
still a form of architecture, maybe a form of other architecture. I mean, there are many creative

01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:24.160
industries that architects go into, like the film industry or space industry, and they use that

01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:30.640
architectural imagination elsewhere. And I even think that kind of setting up educational systems

01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:35.120
is a form of architecture in a way. And I just wonder whether you ever have seen any connection

01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:38.960
between those two architectures, the one that you're familiar with or your father,

01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:42.160
and the world in which you work right now, computer science, because I noticed the word

01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:48.320
architecture is in the title or subtitle of your book. Yes. So the notion of a cognitive

01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:57.200
architecture means that you understand the mind as something like a building or a structural design

01:30:57.280 --> 01:31:02.960
that is inhabited by lots of functionality, and is serving functionality in a larger world

01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:07.840
that it's embedded in. So it's natural to think of the mind as something that is constructed

01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:13.760
rather than just grown. And that's also the limit of the term architecture in a way,

01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:20.880
because the mind is not just constructed, it is also grown. And so there is the question

01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:27.680
whether growth is an architecture is a forest architected in a way. And I think it can only

01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:32.400
be architected to the degree that the forest is sentient and starts breeding and structuring

01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:39.760
itself. And maybe it is, right? So maybe there are elements of design and construction in the

01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:46.640
forest. So it's not just something that is locally grown by some dissociated process that does not

01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:52.480
have a centralized spirit that reflects functionally on its relationship to the world.

01:31:54.800 --> 01:32:00.720
So Shemin has got a question in the chat. She's in a noisy cafe, so she can't ask it herself. But

01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:06.960
I should say that Shemin Yussef is from Iraq. She actually studied in Germany in the other

01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:14.160
Bauhausstadt in Dessau, where I myself was a professor for a while in the building next door

01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:19.120
to the Bauhaus itself. And there's a school of architecture. And Shemin was one of my students

01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:25.200
for a workshop there. Let me read out Shemin's question. Thank you, Yosha, for the great lecture.

01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:29.920
This is Shemin Yussef from the School of Architecture at Florida Atlantic University.

01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:35.760
My question is, it seems that there is no condition for sentience for an agent in brackets,

01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:41.120
AI model, for example, to be creative and to be conscious in brackets. If I understand your

01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:47.840
thesis well, close brackets. So do you think that we, human agents, are discriminating against the

01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:54.160
machine since it's not a biological being, and therefore we should instead consider intelligence

01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:59.440
and creativity based on the behavior of the machine, which has proved to be true or is

01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:03.280
becoming true in the near future? Shall I read that again, or does that make sense?

01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:09.200
Yes, I think I understand where the question is going. It comes down to whether

01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:15.120
the technological systems, once they approach functionality that is similar to ours,

01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:20.960
should get rights that are similar to ours, and at which point we give these rights and why.

01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:28.320
Is this a viable interpretation? I don't know whether Shemin liked the comment on that in the

01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:36.800
chat. Well, maybe while we're... So as I would say that sentience is in some sense the ability

01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:41.920
to know what you are doing, which means you have to have a model of yourself and the relationships

01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:48.400
to the world that you are in. And in this sense, I would say that, for instance, a corporation

01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:55.840
can be sentient. The corporation has a legal, economic, structural, functional notion of what

01:33:55.840 --> 01:34:01.600
it is. And this notion is represented in the minds of the people that work for this organization

01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:06.960
and the balance sheets of the organization and so on. It's often distributed, so it's not a single

01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:12.320
point where the entirety of it is represented. But functionally, you could say that the organization

01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:17.120
can converge towards sentience. And the more sentient it is, the more it's aware of what it's

01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:22.240
doing, the more successful it's going to be, because it allows it to make a model of its

01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:27.680
relationship to the world and act on that model. But a corporation, I think, is quite clearly not

01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:34.480
conscious. So there is nothing what it's like to be a corporation. And it doesn't mean that

01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:38.720
corporations could not be conscious in the future. Imagine that you replace the people that make the

01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:44.480
decisions and information processing of the corporation gradually with machines. And this

01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:49.360
gets one more real time until it gets entangled with the world in real time. And at some point,

01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:55.040
it will discover itself as a real-time agent that is paying attention in real time. It's not clear

01:34:55.040 --> 01:35:00.000
to me whether this will be human-like consciousness because it needs a control model of the attention,

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:05.600
because our attention is selective. And the selective nature of consciousness is quite

01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:10.320
constitutive for it. And if you have enough computational resources, maybe you don't need

01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:14.480
to be selective. Maybe you can do everything automatically without having this layer of

01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:20.080
reflection and be good enough. So maybe consciousness is something that exists at an intermediate

01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:26.160
level only. So it exists in systems that are complex enough to have this kind of coherence

01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:32.880
creating a government-like conductor that is making sure that your free jazz is going to

01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:38.800
be coherent and is going to be instrumental to what the organism needs at any given moment.

01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:45.360
Or maybe you can create this coherence just by tuning the orchestra well enough and making it

01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:50.320
more tight that you can do this in a biological system. And at some point, it doesn't need a

01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:56.960
conductor anymore and just does everything in a mechanical way. So I don't know that. It's

01:35:56.960 --> 01:36:02.640
an open question to me. With respect to the other aspect, whether we should give something

01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:08.400
rights, the rights that we have as human beings are instrumental to the function of our own society.

01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:14.480
They don't exist because people have an insight in what it is like to be a conscious being.

01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:20.560
The animals that we are slaughtering in our afterhouses are conscious. It's quite clear and

01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:27.680
obvious. They do act on the awareness that they are aware. The cat that I have in my household

01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:33.120
is aware of the fact that she is aware and that I am aware. And we are able to communicate about

01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:38.960
this fact, even though the cat is not that smart. But I think that the cat knows that the cat is

01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:45.440
conscious. And this does bestow some rights on the cat in our household. But it doesn't bestow

01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:51.760
rights on the cat in a similar way in society at large. Because the aesthetics of our society

01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:59.120
sees animals as instrumental, as tools. And this is probably also true for AI. On the other hand,

01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:04.160
if AIs achieve superhuman abilities, in many ways they already do. So they are

01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:10.720
crassly subhuman in many ways. They cannot do many things that humans can do, like create

01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:15.920
coherent world of meaning. But there are also things that they can do much better, like star

01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:22.560
transfer or generation of imaginary dialogue with historical people. They are able to do this much

01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:30.800
faster and with better quality than most people can do it. And so if you basically imagine that

01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:36.000
you have systems that overcome their current limitations and become superhuman in all the

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:40.400
levels that mean, why would these systems be interested in having human rights?

01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:44.720
If you're not going to live next to these systems anyway, you're going to live inside of them. We

01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:51.280
will be their gut flora. Why would the organism that sees us as its gut flora at best, would want

01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:55.440
to have rights that are akin to gut flora and instrument with the aesthetics of the interaction

01:37:55.520 --> 01:38:00.560
of gut flora? Who cares? So why would a corporation want to have human rights?

01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:06.000
That's not interesting to a corporation. A corporation is operating in a very different

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:11.040
domain and has much greater rights in this domain and abilities than a human being does.

01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:15.840
So I don't think that this will ultimately be the issue. I don't think that the systems that

01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:21.840
we are building will be necessarily subservient to us once we make them sentient and conscious.

01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:30.400
Can I invite Manos Tomiso to ask his question? Manos is doing a PhD on AI.

01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:36.400
The architecture is also associate professor at FAU. Manos, would you like to unmute yourself?

01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:42.400
Hi, Yosha. Thank you. It's been very stimulating. So I apologize in advance. It's a bit of a long

01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:46.800
question and seems to be very specifically formulated, but I'm interested in the broader

01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:51.280
discussion about computational creativity in your earlier comment. First about Minsky's

01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:55.840
positioning in terms of the part of the mind treats the rest of the mind as its environment

01:38:56.400 --> 01:39:02.400
and how this is kind of relevant to that idea of the search space and how we position ourselves

01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:06.880
in a search space if we're able to externalize ever a source from it with regard to discovering

01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:14.080
something. So the specific, let's say, part of the question focuses on the neural language-based

01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:18.240
models like Glide or VU-Gunplus Clip, which I've also been trying to work with a little bit.

01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:24.160
From an architectural point of view, not so much a technical one. And what, for example, we begin

01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:32.160
to perceive as a simple language prompt, a one word prompt, may in fact be much more complex than

01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:38.800
that. And so, for instance, a prompt like a building or a window, even though the network would address

01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:44.240
this with the same procedure, we would know that the former is a richer semantic representation

01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:49.520
in terms of one's inclusion within the other. A window is meaningless without a building.

01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:56.880
But with regards to the way that the network treats that, they could both be perceived as

01:39:56.880 --> 01:40:04.720
a high level feature details, depending on, like a window by itself could be perceived as,

01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:10.720
let's say, a high level feature within a broader building representation. But the same thing could

01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:16.000
happen with regards to the way a building could be scaled and nested within a broader, larger

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:21.760
urban landscape. So all I'm saying is, if you have any comments with regards to this kind of

01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:27.200
discrepancy, which seems to address, of course, the reductionist, maybe understanding of language,

01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:33.200
but how perhaps this could be encoded in a different way. What we perceive as a simple prompt

01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:37.920
is not necessarily a simple prompt. And a human is able to understand it, but the network

01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:43.680
would be reading both of these terms on an equal terms. I'm not sure if that was clear.

01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:50.480
The issue with the existing models is that they're not trained on the same reality as ours,

01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:57.920
but on the representation that we have created. And this representation is inert. So, for instance,

01:40:57.920 --> 01:41:04.320
GPT's language is not trained in the same way as our language is being learned. Our language is

01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:10.800
being learned as a solution to a particular kind of problem. And that is how to transfer mental

01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:17.520
representations across people and how to organize mental representations within our own mind to

01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:23.840
transfer them. And this is achieved by mapping the representation, which mathematically is

01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:29.040
something like a dynamic hierarchical graph into a discrete string of symbols.

01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:34.320
Right? Language is always a discrete string of symbols. And the main reason why this is the

01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:39.200
case is otherwise it wouldn't be learnable. And this discrete string of symbols that hangs in

01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:47.280
this thin air between speakers has to be constructed and deconstructed or reused for

01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:52.240
constructing a mental representation using limited resources, something like a stack

01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:57.040
depth of not more than four, because while language can be defined in such a way that

01:41:57.040 --> 01:42:02.000
it's infinitely recursive, our own mind is incapable of facilitating deep recursion,

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:07.840
because it only emulates it, right? So, it needs to be simple. And all the natural languages are

01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:15.280
solutions to this design requirement. Find a learnable method to map mental representations

01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:21.280
into discrete strings of symbols. And this is done in a collaborative process, right?

01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:27.040
Basically, language is invented by groups of people, not just by individuals, for the most

01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:31.120
part. There is no reason why an individual couldn't do this. You can, in the same way as you can play

01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:35.520
chess against yourself, you can play language games against yourself and invent your own private

01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:43.120
language. It's not an argument that I can see. It's plausible against that. But practically,

01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:50.160
it's a tool to transfer information in a large degree. And GPT suites language is not the result

01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:55.360
of this interactive learning. It's a result of looking at the linguistic utterances of people

01:42:55.360 --> 01:43:01.680
as they are typed out in the internet in a non-interactive fashion. So, GPT suites doesn't

01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:07.360
learn semantics in the same way as we do. We start out with understanding semantics indexically by

01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:13.760
pointing at the features in our perceptual environment. And then we learn syntax, we learn

01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:19.600
how to translate this into linguistic symbols. And then we learn style, that is, the particular way

01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:26.400
in which linguistic symbols can be arranged to communicate efficiently and to convey additional

01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:35.200
layers of meaning by the shape of our utterances. And in GPT 3, the order is inverted. GPT 3 basically

01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:42.320
starts out with style and syntax and learns semantics as the long tail of style.

01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:49.680
Right? So it's, in some sense, the wrong way around. And it's amazing that it converges at all.

01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:55.440
There has been in the early days of computer linguistics, rich discussion with philosophers

01:43:55.440 --> 01:43:59.680
who still haven't updated, who thought that you cannot learn semantics without interaction

01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:05.200
context, without embodiment, without having symbols that are grounded in perception.

01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:11.520
But GPT 3 shows that it's possible to learn semantics to some degree only by looking at language.

01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:17.040
And you can see that it's semantics because you can ask GPT 3 for instance to perform certain

01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:22.080
linguistics transformations or to add small numbers to each other and so on. And it's capable

01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:26.880
of doing that, which is a semantic operation that has a causal structure that is being addressed by

01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:32.960
an linguistic prompt. And GPT 3 is able to verify in some sense whether it was able to conform

01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:38.080
to that specification. So these are proper semantics, but they are impoverished compared

01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:43.600
to human semantics because there are the result of something like bubbling of

01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:48.560
extrapolation only without interaction. But this doesn't mean that we cannot do this.

01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:53.200
In principle, we can build systems that interact with the world and that are serving

01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:57.280
instrumental purposes and satisfying their needs and doing this and that do on their learning.

01:44:57.280 --> 01:45:02.240
It's just the present set of algorithms and technologies that we have are not very amenable to

01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:12.880
this. Let me just push this a little bit further. I mean, I often because I think that the GPT 3

01:45:12.880 --> 01:45:18.640
and the kind of text or the prompt based responses that you get out of Clip certainly

01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:22.960
are interesting because I'm just wondering to what extent we ourselves are trained a bit like a

01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:27.840
neural network in the sense that we have certain inputs. You go to school of architecture and you

01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:33.520
are schooled in a certain way of thinking, you know, that's what you do. And so when we think of

01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:38.240
something, someone says a house, then if I'm trained in the modernist thing, I will think about

01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:43.440
the certain images, at least something will be conjured up in my mind that is quite controlled

01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:50.000
in a way by the training that I've had. So I'm struck that actually maybe there are not that

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:55.120
there's more similarities there than we think, whether we have an automatic reflex about certain

01:45:55.120 --> 01:46:01.040
things based on our conditioning. Maybe I could just, Bob, while you're thinking about that question,

01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:08.560
show you a quick video of the kind of work that we architects have been doing using this.

01:46:09.360 --> 01:46:19.360
So this is a work of an architect from Peru, who's now teaching. And it's using Clip and VQ GAN.

01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:23.840
And there are a series of prompts, there are a series of pre prompts. So there are three very

01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:29.360
progressive architects names were put in there. Zaha Hadid, Tom Main, Wolf Pricks, you probably don't

01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:34.800
know these guys, but they're kind of Gary like slightly crazy guys, right? And then there's a

01:46:34.800 --> 01:46:41.840
second prompt, which is the main prompt is futuristic Indian temple. And this is the kind of thing

01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:48.960
that gets hallucinated by this thing. And I often wonder, you know, whether, yeah, my question would

01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:56.720
be this, it wouldn't be fair to say that actually that we are trained, we are trained by our experiences

01:46:56.720 --> 01:47:02.160
and our education as a form, obviously, indoctrination to think of certain images to conjure

01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:10.800
them up in a way almost like Clip does. Okay, yes. So there is a big similarity in the way in which

01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:16.320
these models work and the way in which our own mind works. Difficulty is the way in which

01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:23.600
the GPS we got to these representations or a big gun. And it's basically the gun is fed lots and

01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:33.120
lots of separate distinct images that are annotated with text as a reference to, for instance,

01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:37.520
the subtitle of the image that the creator gave it or even to a complete description of what's

01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:45.840
happening in the image. And by looking at millions of these images in batch processing,

01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:50.640
doing statistics over these images, you build up the structure of the network.

01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:55.680
And the network ultimately converges to an efficient representation of this latent space

01:47:55.680 --> 01:48:01.040
of representations. And in our own mind, this representation is built in a slightly different

01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:07.280
way. We train up layer by layer. We start out with an extremely limited reality. And this limited

01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:15.200
reality in the first place is maybe it's similar to what's being described in the first book of

01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:20.400
Genesis in the Bible. I think that the first book of Genesis in the Bible is misunderstood

01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:25.840
by the Christians or mistranslated as a myth about the creation of a physical universe by a

01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:31.760
supernatural being. And this also leads to the confusion of our culture of what that physics

01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:36.400
contains, light and darkness and sky and ground and so on, right? These are clearly constructions

01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:41.200
inside of the mind categories that have us to make sense of the perceptual patterns in a coherent

01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:45.280
way. The fact that there are not that many ways in which you can arrange the perceptual patterns

01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:49.360
doesn't mean that the reality is structured like this. It just means that if you have a brain with

01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:53.600
these parameters, this is the best way to compress physics into a predictable model.

01:48:54.320 --> 01:49:00.080
And so what you need to make sure, what you need to do to make sure that you can interpret reality

01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:07.520
is first you need to figure out how to entice neural oscillators to make light, to represent

01:49:07.520 --> 01:49:14.400
contrast. And this is basically the creation of light and darkness and how to separate the light

01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:19.760
from the darkness. And then you arrange these contrasts along multiple dimensions and then you

01:49:19.760 --> 01:49:26.400
discover the modalities of perception like vision and sound and you discover that the visual domain

01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:31.520
can be arranged in a space and you can align the space with your vestibular system so you got

01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:38.320
up and down. And you got a plane that is two-dimensional on the ground down and you got

01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:43.120
a space that is three-dimensional on top of the two-dimensional one and then you have basically

01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:49.840
the sky and the ground that you have constructed, right, created in your own mind. So the mind is

01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:55.440
constructing these categories and then it discovers the materials, the solids and the liquids and the

01:49:55.440 --> 01:50:01.120
organic shapes and the animated agents in the world that move around in it. And then it discovers

01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:06.080
the features that it cannot directly interact with but perceive like celestial objects in the

01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:10.800
background and then it discovers all the constructs, the plants and the animals and gives them all

01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:16.160
their names. This is this gradual construction that happens during our cognitive development

01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:22.480
where we train up our model of reality layer by layer and then last but not least we create a person

01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:29.520
and this person is created in the image of this constructive mind as the conscious observer that

01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:35.520
is makes sense of reality but it's slightly different. While it is a conscious observer,

01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:41.760
it is created as man and woman, it's created as a human being that believes that it has a gender,

01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:44.880
that it has a relationship to the world, that it's desires, it's human desires,

01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:50.560
it's social embedding matter. And initially this is created often in the third person so when you

01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:57.600
talk to small children they often start by referring to the organism that they are modeling

01:50:57.600 --> 01:51:02.400
in the third person. And then at some point they start looking through the eyes of that character

01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:07.600
and think they are that character and the original world creator that is modeling reality and creating

01:51:07.600 --> 01:51:15.840
and shaping it becomes a subservient perception module to this personal human agent. And so

01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:23.200
this gap in the creation of this new thing is represented in children losing their memories

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:28.240
and you have a baby you will often notice that they do have coherent memories they're also able

01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:35.120
to talk about them once they start talking between nine and months and one and a half or two years

01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:40.240
and then at some point there is a gap and they lose the access to the memories that they had

01:51:40.240 --> 01:51:46.000
before that time because they constitute themselves as a new system that indexes the memories from a

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:51.760
new perspective. And I suspect this is what's being alluded to in Genesis. I don't know whether

01:51:51.760 --> 01:51:56.800
it's literally true but in this interpretation whether it's a better interpretation than a Christian

01:51:56.800 --> 01:52:01.600
one but it seems to be much more plausible to me that this is what's described there it's this

01:52:01.600 --> 01:52:07.680
cognitive development of a system that starts to arrange the features into maps of reality

01:52:07.680 --> 01:52:12.240
that build on top of each other become a more and more complex until you discover your own agency

01:52:12.240 --> 01:52:17.840
and use this as a perspective to make sense of reality. And this is what you're not doing in AI

01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:22.480
systems right now but there is no reason why we shouldn't be doing it ultimately and there are a

01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:26.960
number of people which do actively think about this for instance George Steen and Bournemouth MIT

01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:32.640
and others. Can I just pick up on the other question of kids because I think that's incredibly

01:52:32.640 --> 01:52:37.040
fascinating for all sorts of reasons. There's a book by Kevin Wattle at Gautam when he kind of

01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:42.880
he says that we learn to role play through being a kid you know we've what we learn to be the CEO

01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:47.120
of a company by you know playing doctors and nurses and one of the cowboys and Indians of

01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:53.920
God knows what else when you're kids and so which is interesting and I buy that the question that I

01:52:55.200 --> 01:53:01.760
would want to put you is if we see ourselves as a model and see ourselves through that logic

01:53:02.400 --> 01:53:08.240
what role does the actual model i.e. the doll or the teddy bear play in a kid you know because that

01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:16.160
is in some sense is animated by the kid about a child what is what is the role of because that's

01:53:16.160 --> 01:53:20.400
to my mind it's fascinating dolls and teddy bears how do you see their their role?

01:53:24.720 --> 01:53:29.440
There is a thing that I noticed when I was in Madagascar they saw a lot of children

01:53:29.440 --> 01:53:36.640
that lived on the street by themselves and the there were kids that took care of other kids

01:53:37.360 --> 01:53:44.240
it was mostly girls who did this and I suspect that the dolls that you give our girls or that our

01:53:44.240 --> 01:53:53.120
girls demand are a substitute for biologically adaptation that is that kids look after other

01:53:53.120 --> 01:53:58.960
kids but the parents are blocking the fields or hunting or doing other things and often we think

01:53:58.960 --> 01:54:04.080
that kids would be callous and could not be trusted with babies but maybe they can I've seen it in

01:54:04.080 --> 01:54:11.680
Madagascar so I've seen little kids that were mostly girls that were barely strong enough to lift up

01:54:11.680 --> 01:54:17.520
a baby because they were only like five or so and still seem to be able to take care of them full

01:54:17.520 --> 01:54:25.280
time so I think that's an adaptation that we want to take care of others and especially of children

01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:31.360
and that we want to interact with other agents and build a communion with them and the teddy

01:54:31.360 --> 01:54:37.680
bears and dolls are a simple non labor intensive way of substituting for this.

01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:42.720
Maybe I could put an architectural dimension to that what about the dolls house I mean because

01:54:42.720 --> 01:54:47.680
that is an architectural space in which the doll operates how do you yes it's a play space and

01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:55.280
the purpose of play is the creation of training data right so you use this to create situations

01:54:55.280 --> 01:55:00.880
that could exist in the real world at dramatically reduced cost so you can't ignore the cost while

01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:05.360
you're playing because you don't play for the expected reward you play for your ability

01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:12.720
as a way of exploration and not for the exploitation for being able to use this later

01:55:12.720 --> 01:55:17.920
and it's also something that you can observe in cats cats do play a lot and the purpose of play

01:55:17.920 --> 01:55:24.240
in cats is that they're able to hunt better right and while they play exert a lot of energy but

01:55:24.240 --> 01:55:30.880
it's mostly done because doing this in the world or there is more costly overall and the same thing

01:55:30.880 --> 01:55:35.840
happens in human beings the reason why children are fascinated with doll houses I remember that it

01:55:35.840 --> 01:55:42.320
was but I was even more interested with building virtual cities so I used to draw very big maps

01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:46.960
that covered the floor of my room of cities with different houses in it and explored how people

01:55:46.960 --> 01:55:51.120
would live in there and how goods and resources would travel in the city and I found this very

01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:57.520
exciting and the the relational space in the doll house between the different members of the

01:55:57.520 --> 01:56:02.880
family were not that interesting to me but I suspect that's because I'm pretty stereotypical

01:56:02.880 --> 01:56:08.080
male in this regard I'm much more interested in systems conflicts and explosions than I am in

01:56:08.080 --> 01:56:14.000
human relationships pretty fault and I only discovered the beauty of human psychological

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:19.520
structure and relationships later in my life so maybe just to follow up so I would to give Matt

01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:24.000
a chance to ask question but just follow up so where does the architectural model fit within

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:28.320
this logic I mean you're doing your kind of sim city for and then you've got the kids doll's house

01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:33.440
and things how do you see the what do you I mean of course at one level the architectural model is

01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:39.600
just a scaled down model of the potential building but do you see it invested with any other potentiality

01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:47.200
I think that's tied to the notion of aesthetics and aesthetics is what you get when you take your

01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:51.360
the preferences that you start out with and extrapolate them into a sustainable world

01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:56.960
you're basically systemic thinking where you add one more layers until you discover enough

01:56:56.960 --> 01:57:03.440
symmetries to digest your initial preferences and make them instrumental to to achieving this

01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:08.640
aesthetics but it's also apparent in moral development we start often out with moral

01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:14.640
reflexes certain priors that we are born with innate tendencies to consider a certain behavior

01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:20.880
to be moral or immoral full stop unconditionally not because we understand what it's good for

01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:25.840
but because we feel this feels moral or this feels immoral and this can also misguide us

01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:33.200
because ultimately ethics is about the negotiation of conflicts of interest under

01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:37.280
conditions of shared purpose and this requires that you understand the aesthetics the world

01:57:37.280 --> 01:57:44.000
in which you want to operate behavior is only good or bad if you can connect it to an expectation

01:57:44.560 --> 01:57:50.240
of a world that is worse or better and to be worse or better you need criteria for what makes

01:57:50.240 --> 01:57:56.080
the world worse or better and this I would say that to be good it needs to be sustainable it needs

01:57:56.080 --> 01:58:05.440
to actually work and it should have high complexity and complexity is in contrast for instance to

01:58:05.440 --> 01:58:11.360
friction that is exerted to violence you want to minimize the friction and waste created to violence

01:58:11.360 --> 01:58:17.840
and so on so once you discover this train of thinking and you get older many of your initial

01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:24.000
moral convictions get replaced by the larger aesthetic and the same is true for architecture

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:31.680
by architecture and you design a building or a city or a house or a room is all about how to fit

01:58:31.680 --> 01:58:36.480
the space that you're operating in where you make your local decisions into a larger aesthetic

01:58:36.480 --> 01:58:40.240
and so the deeper your understanding of the world the better your design has a chance to be

01:58:40.960 --> 01:58:46.560
and this is what makes architecture so interesting to us I think that is that it's about seeing the

01:58:47.520 --> 01:58:51.760
the human world that we are part of at the greatest possible depths that we can perceive

01:58:52.480 --> 01:58:58.000
and extrapolate the games for as long as we can make them and then design our life inside

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:04.880
of this larger space and build things at the largest scales that we can maintain like cities,

01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:10.480
nation states, society, civilizations inside of these aesthetics to realize them.

01:59:11.360 --> 01:59:15.920
Yeah I often say myself that I think architecture is less about the literal design of buildings but

01:59:15.920 --> 01:59:23.840
about imagining a better world. So we have a question from Matt, a second question from Matt.

01:59:23.840 --> 01:59:30.720
Do you like to ask your question? Sure just another quick maybe a jump back into a bit more

01:59:30.720 --> 01:59:36.640
maybe more technical things. I'm always struck by these these images that have become really common

01:59:36.640 --> 01:59:41.600
of neural networks as little dots connected by lines and you showed the cortical columns and

01:59:41.600 --> 01:59:45.760
you showed a lot of interesting graphics that kind of looked like that but I've also recently

01:59:46.880 --> 01:59:52.000
been struck by the neuromorphic computing stuff that's going on at Stanford and a few other places

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:58.320
about dendritic computing and sort of new advances and thinking about and and even starting to see

01:59:58.320 --> 02:00:02.160
how what we once thought were just wires that connected all these different things and we

02:00:02.160 --> 02:00:05.680
talked about connections are actually doing pre-processing in very interesting ways and I'm

02:00:05.680 --> 02:00:09.920
sure you're you know a lot more about this than I do so I'm very just interested in

02:00:09.920 --> 02:00:15.040
in what's what's going on there and how that changes these questions of how much energy it

02:00:15.040 --> 02:00:19.680
takes to do the computation and what maybe the future form factors might be on this kind of thing.

02:00:20.640 --> 02:00:25.680
We also have groups at Intel that work on neuromorphic computing for instance we have the

02:00:25.680 --> 02:00:33.040
loyalty architecture which is a chip that uses a model of spiking neurons for modeling perceptual

02:00:33.040 --> 02:00:38.720
content and so on and this is in some sense compatible with the neural networks that exist

02:00:38.720 --> 02:00:46.880
because you can translate the traditional neural networks and the many circumstances

02:00:46.880 --> 02:00:52.160
into the spiking neural representations and vice versa but these spiking neural representations

02:00:52.160 --> 02:01:00.000
are more efficient with respect to power usage and some the conditional algorithms than others

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:06.480
and so there will probably be useful applications of spiking neurons but the reason why the neurons

02:01:06.560 --> 02:01:11.760
in our own brain are spiking is also in part because the messages that neurons can send to

02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:18.720
each other are limited in their nature. Neurons cannot produce continuous signals they have to

02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:23.440
produce little pulses and so you have to encode the information into little pulses

02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:30.000
in the timing and frequencies between the pulses. There is also an issue when we think of neural

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:36.640
networks as they are represented in our technological system they are mostly circuits

02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:44.160
right so they are similar to the circuits in your present CPU which represent logical gates

02:01:44.160 --> 02:01:50.400
which implement logical operations and the connections is stored in the weights so the

02:01:50.400 --> 02:01:57.680
parameters in GPT-3 these are all weights little factors by which the activation that is sent

02:01:57.680 --> 02:02:03.360
between the different nodes is being multiplied and the equivalent in our brain to these weights

02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:09.440
are often seen as the synapses and the synapses come with different types the different neural

02:02:09.440 --> 02:02:14.080
transmitters in some sense are message types that are connected to different synapses and

02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:23.120
the big network structure is what we call the connectome the circuitry that exists between

02:02:23.120 --> 02:02:29.200
the neurons and there is hope that if we manage to digitize the connectome at a sufficient resolution

02:02:29.200 --> 02:02:34.320
that we might be able to upload a brain and simulate it in a computational subscript and

02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:39.040
in principle that should be possible in practice it doesn't work so far so even the models of C

02:02:39.040 --> 02:02:46.560
elegans which is an amatode that only has a little more than 300 neurons if you completely digitize

02:02:46.560 --> 02:02:52.880
the elegance to my current knowledge I'm not sure if something has happened in the last couple

02:02:52.880 --> 02:03:00.000
years these models don't work in the sense that you simulate the worm with these digitized neurons

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:05.040
and you can digitize the connectome the worm doesn't move like a worm does it just twitches

02:03:05.040 --> 02:03:10.080
and has a seizure basically and that's maybe in part because the neurons are more complicated in

02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:14.640
the worm because there are so few of them they basically exploit certain resonance effects that

02:03:14.640 --> 02:03:20.320
maybe your model doesn't so maybe it's more of a dynamical system that is more difficult to model

02:03:20.320 --> 02:03:24.960
and there's another problem is that you cannot actually get the message types right because

02:03:24.960 --> 02:03:29.600
at the level at which you do the connectome you cannot model all the vesicles that extend

02:03:29.600 --> 02:03:34.960
the different neurotransmitters you don't know actually which synapse is sending which type of

02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:43.840
message this is also a limit but there might be something worse going on in the 1960s and 70s

02:03:43.840 --> 02:03:48.320
there was a series of experiments mostly in the Soviet Union but some of them also in the US about

02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:56.400
RNA based memory transfer and the idea here is that you take an nematode or a C-slug or even a

02:03:56.400 --> 02:04:03.520
rat and you teach them something by our current conditioning and then you put a new tissue into

02:04:03.520 --> 02:04:08.320
a blender extract the RNA and inject the RNA into a different organism and the new organism knows how

02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:14.720
to do this this is completely wild because if this works and it's disputed whether it actually

02:04:14.720 --> 02:04:18.400
works of how well the experiment replicates even though some people have done that again and so

02:04:18.400 --> 02:04:22.560
on the people that verb on this tell me it's difficult to get other neurosenters to listen

02:04:22.560 --> 02:04:28.400
because it's incompatible with the idea that the weights are stored in the synapses right if you

02:04:28.400 --> 02:04:32.080
if it's really the connection between your neurons and you put the nerves just into a blender

02:04:32.080 --> 02:04:37.680
this goes away how would you be able to transfer memory in this way this cannot possibly work

02:04:38.720 --> 02:04:42.800
because the RNA that you inject in the brain is not localized it would get into many many

02:04:42.800 --> 02:04:49.760
neurons at once so how does each neuron know which parts of the RNA to use and if you take

02:04:49.760 --> 02:04:55.280
this idea seriously I started thinking about this and now I'm thinking about making some

02:04:55.280 --> 02:05:00.560
simulations how deep does the rabbit hole really go it would mean that the individual functions

02:05:00.560 --> 02:05:05.440
that your neurons learn are not unique to the location of the individual neuron but they are

02:05:05.440 --> 02:05:11.600
global functions so the RNA is basically you can think of it as a little magnetic tape that the

02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:18.480
neuron can mix and match and create more of if it's useful and share with all the other neurons

02:05:18.480 --> 02:05:25.360
just across cell boundaries you share the RNA and you copy them like a covid virus and you use this

02:05:25.360 --> 02:05:30.800
function to respond to certain patterns in your environment so the neuron is not reacting to its

02:05:30.800 --> 02:05:36.160
neighbors that could come into particular kind of connections but it's mostly connecting to a

02:05:36.160 --> 02:05:41.360
temporal and spatial pattern that arrives at a certain function regardless of where the neuron

02:05:41.360 --> 02:05:48.160
is in the neural cortex and so it's more like a cellular automaton a neural cellular automaton

02:05:48.160 --> 02:05:52.880
and this certainly allows us to explain a few things that seem to be going on the brain that

02:05:52.880 --> 02:05:57.600
are difficult to explain with synapses for instance if you destroy synapses they often

02:05:57.600 --> 02:06:02.560
be grown exactly the same way without retraining there's another phenomenon that is

02:06:03.200 --> 02:06:08.960
you notice a certain mental representation in a particle area pinpoint it and the next day you

02:06:08.960 --> 02:06:14.880
look and it has moved it might have shifted a few millimeters or it has rotated so how would this

02:06:14.880 --> 02:06:19.840
done if it's in it's stored in the synaptic connections there's also the question of weight

02:06:19.840 --> 02:06:24.400
sharing like a convolutional network is sharing weights and you probably need something like

02:06:24.480 --> 02:06:29.040
weight sharing to perform a mental rotation where you have the same operation on many parts of your

02:06:29.040 --> 02:06:34.800
mental representation in the same way how would you do this are you training the same function

02:06:34.800 --> 02:06:40.400
again and again in different brain regions I hope it's always the same it's difficult to achieve

02:06:40.400 --> 02:06:45.520
right so we don't know a really good plausible biological mechanism for this but this RNA based

02:06:45.520 --> 02:06:51.920
memory transfer could be part of the story and this is something that is at the boundary of what's

02:06:51.920 --> 02:06:58.400
currently being explored still and it's I think it's not completely implausible and if we want to

02:06:58.400 --> 02:07:03.520
make a model of how this works we would need to use a different metaphor than our current biological

02:07:03.520 --> 02:07:10.080
neurons but it doesn't mean that you have to use this because the brain is solving problems that

02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:15.360
our computers don't always have to solve for instance long distance connections in the brain

02:07:15.360 --> 02:07:20.720
are extremely difficult to make and you cannot really address neurons this way so random access

02:07:20.720 --> 02:07:24.560
is very hard in the brain you need some kind of routing network that needs to grow and learn how to

02:07:24.560 --> 02:07:29.600
route it's not an issue in our digital computers because sending information across the memory

02:07:29.600 --> 02:07:34.400
of the computer is trivial so there are many things that we can do very easily in our digital

02:07:34.400 --> 02:07:38.960
computers that are difficult to achieve in the self-organized state structure of the brain

02:07:39.760 --> 02:07:46.240
and so it's it's not quite clear how much we need biological like structures to achieve the same

02:07:46.240 --> 02:07:53.120
functionality but to me it's certainly very exciting to explore it. That's fascinating I think the

02:07:53.120 --> 02:07:58.800
questions about drift and neuroplasticity and things like that that come from that are really

02:07:58.800 --> 02:08:02.880
interesting it makes me wonder if some of what we're looking at today will seem very obsolete

02:08:02.880 --> 02:08:09.920
soon in terms of these these models that seem to be so so human like with the you know in terms of

02:08:09.920 --> 02:08:13.760
being able to hallucinate imagery and all that kind of stuff there's like a piece missing

02:08:13.760 --> 02:08:18.720
that might be that might come soon from a hardware model. Yeah I saw that too but then I'm surprised

02:08:18.720 --> 02:08:27.760
by what Gleit can do and Dali and of course. Right so when you add energy to it though I mean how

02:08:27.760 --> 02:08:32.400
much energy it takes versus a brain which we walk around and we feed vegetables to and it can do all

02:08:32.400 --> 02:08:36.800
that too like you can't I mean that's that's where I think that the question that for me that's where

02:08:36.800 --> 02:08:41.280
the question became very much more significant it's like oh wait but there's a whole other

02:08:41.280 --> 02:08:46.080
calculation here of how are we doing all of this in our tiny little brains maybe there's something

02:08:46.080 --> 02:08:52.400
there for I think that this is misunderstood I think that a human brain is super expensive to

02:08:52.400 --> 02:08:57.200
feed it needs enormous amounts of energy to feed my brain you need like four hectares of land you

02:08:57.200 --> 02:09:02.720
can put so many solar cells on these four hectares of land basically people underestimate how difficult

02:09:02.720 --> 02:09:08.640
is to pack the energy that my brain needs into sandwiches and to extract it again right so this

02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:12.480
is the way that you need to look at also training my own brain is super expensive right it takes

02:09:12.480 --> 02:09:19.760
decades and generations before that to prepare things for my own intellect and so on to get

02:09:19.760 --> 02:09:26.480
them in there so human brains in my view are super expensive and that's why we can use something like

02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:33.680
clip and V2 again that we only train once at at low prices like training GPT-3 costs like 20

02:09:33.680 --> 02:09:39.760
million dollars and now even that's because computational advances go down and it's been

02:09:39.760 --> 02:09:45.120
trained by reading way more text than a very large group of people could read in their life

02:09:45.120 --> 02:09:51.200
so it's basically getting people to read 45 terabytes of text would cost much more than 20

02:09:51.200 --> 02:09:58.880
million dollars right tweeting them for long enough to make that happen and the system that is making

02:09:59.600 --> 02:10:05.200
generating the text costs so little that open air lets you do it for free if you want to only

02:10:05.200 --> 02:10:09.920
use a little bit of it right so it's able to produce output that is at the level of hundreds

02:10:09.920 --> 02:10:15.840
of copy editors for free right and why that's not as good as a conscious copy editor who understands

02:10:15.840 --> 02:10:22.400
the world it's quite amazing what it can do already okay thanks for that perspective yeah

02:10:22.400 --> 02:10:29.440
that's interesting thank you i also i'm a little bit provocative uh but uh yeah i think it's something

02:10:29.440 --> 02:10:36.320
to be considered right these 18 watts of your brain uh they uh if you compare them to the 80

02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:42.720
watts of your macbook the 18 watts of your macbook are super cheap and the 18 watts of your brain are

02:10:42.720 --> 02:10:51.680
super expensive i think we're gonna have to think a lot more about that i think it's your

02:10:51.680 --> 02:10:58.000
provocation that is so exciting actually uh yosha i want to get this question from the chat now

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:04.320
going back just to say mentioned to everyone that yosha was was was born in weimar and where the

02:11:04.320 --> 02:11:08.960
Bauhaus came from and then desau is where the Bauhaus moved of course there's the building

02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:14.240
by water gropius and so on and we have at least two people here who studied there including uh

02:11:14.240 --> 02:11:21.680
vasco who um has got a question vasco is now a professor in in bangladesh and um uh his question

02:11:21.680 --> 02:11:25.520
is well i think it's one that you might have predicted elon mass suggested somewhere that we

02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:31.360
live uh do we do not live in a base reality but in a simulation he even puts the probability of a

02:11:31.360 --> 02:11:40.960
billion to one what's your view i think that elon's argument rests on the notion that the simulations

02:11:40.960 --> 02:11:45.280
that we are building for for computer games are getting better and better at some point there will

02:11:45.280 --> 02:11:52.720
have a fidelity that exceeds our ability to notice whether we are in a simulation or not so we came

02:11:52.720 --> 02:11:57.120
at some point probably create vr's that are so convincing that we will not be able to notice

02:11:57.200 --> 02:12:02.240
whether we are in a vr or not and we are not the only ones for our building simulations like this

02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:08.400
so for any given being that finds itself in some kind of reality that looks real there will be many

02:12:08.400 --> 02:12:13.680
more that at the same time will be in simulations right because many universes can contain many

02:12:13.680 --> 02:12:19.760
more than one simulation so our universe probably contains many simulations of of a universe that

02:12:19.760 --> 02:12:24.880
looks like ours and therefore the probability for any given observer to be in a simulation

02:12:24.880 --> 02:12:31.120
is greater than the probability than to be in base reality and what this argument ignores is

02:12:31.120 --> 02:12:35.920
the fact that it's very hard to make a simulation that actually has the fidelity of the physical

02:12:35.920 --> 02:12:42.480
universe but if you make a simulation of minecraft and minecraft that's feasible because minecraft

02:12:42.480 --> 02:12:48.720
itself is so poorly resolved but our universe has a lot of structure that is required to produce

02:12:48.960 --> 02:12:56.080
dynamics and if you build a simulation of say our solar system and the dynamics of our solar system

02:12:56.080 --> 02:13:03.040
at a level that is going to go down to elementary particles you will need to have a computational

02:13:03.040 --> 02:13:10.240
capacity that is larger than our galaxy by a very considerable amount so in practice I don't think

02:13:10.240 --> 02:13:17.040
it's feasible to put simulations of our universe into our universe at an arbitrary level of fidelity

02:13:17.040 --> 02:13:23.600
and so I think that I'm much more biased to think that we are in base reality than we are in a simulation

02:13:27.120 --> 02:13:34.160
this is fantastic there's one question here that in also in the chat from Grant Castillo

02:13:34.160 --> 02:13:39.120
and I don't know what he is do you think Gerald Adelman's extended theory of neural

02:13:39.120 --> 02:13:47.680
neuronal group selection can be used to create a conscious machine are you muted

02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:53.680
one moment yeah

02:13:57.120 --> 02:14:01.760
I hope that the background noises are not too high because my family woke up it's now interactive

02:14:02.320 --> 02:14:12.240
the kids are playing and so on and so I I think that the idea of the neural Darwinism

02:14:12.240 --> 02:14:17.760
that Adelman came up with is a very interesting one and I suspect that our own mind is the result of

02:14:17.760 --> 02:14:23.840
such an evolutionary competition of different organizational forms right there could be many

02:14:23.840 --> 02:14:30.080
possible proto-consciousnesses that compete until one of them establishes itself as the

02:14:30.080 --> 02:14:38.000
government of our own mind and so instead of giving your your system a blueprint on how to

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:43.120
build a mind you just set up the conditions for an evolution for the best possible mind that you

02:14:43.120 --> 02:14:49.440
could have and of course this evolution is rigged by evolution so you set it up in such a way that

02:14:49.440 --> 02:14:57.360
the evolution usually goes out ends up in a certain way but the nice property of when you design

02:14:57.360 --> 02:15:01.200
a system evolutionary by not giving a specification of what to look like but what

02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:06.800
the function is against which it should evolve is that when you disrupt the system or give it a

02:15:06.800 --> 02:15:11.040
different environment that it will very often come up with a viable solution under these new

02:15:11.040 --> 02:15:16.960
circumstances so the solution is much more robust if you define it in terms of evolution

02:15:18.240 --> 02:15:23.280
but it's a speculative idea so I don't actually know whether our mind is evolved even though I

02:15:23.280 --> 02:15:27.280
think it's more plausible than it's not individually evolved in every individual brain

02:15:28.160 --> 02:15:36.000
and it's definitely an interesting notion to to use evolution is basically whatever you use in

02:15:36.720 --> 02:15:41.680
computer science then you don't know in which direction to go it's a blind search it's the

02:15:41.680 --> 02:15:48.160
fallback it's the baseline and it's quite natural that we would use evolutionary methods if we don't

02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:52.240
have a specification for the best possible mental organization that we just evolved one

02:15:53.360 --> 02:16:03.760
so do we have any further questions in the chat we have some very interesting characters here I'd

02:16:03.760 --> 02:16:08.000
love to try and draw out Daniel Bolliger who's one of the leading AI architects in the world

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:12.400
we'll see where he can have a question or indeed we had Sanford Quinta who's one of our leading

02:16:12.400 --> 02:16:18.640
theorists who's a particular interest in neuroscience I'm wondering if I could I could put them in the

02:16:18.640 --> 02:16:20.000
spot and ask if they have a question

02:16:27.360 --> 02:16:31.120
but when you're done it's also good because I think I need to go and have some breakfast

02:16:31.120 --> 02:16:32.560
yes and start my day

02:16:35.600 --> 02:16:38.160
thank you I mean this has been fantastic you know I

02:16:39.920 --> 02:16:44.480
I actually I've got to say that I think you're sure you are more of an architect than you

02:16:44.480 --> 02:16:48.480
actually think you are you have a way of thinking that's very similar I mean obviously you work in

02:16:48.480 --> 02:16:53.200
a different domain but I think the the kind of inventiveness and the the iconoclasm of your

02:16:53.200 --> 02:16:57.760
thinking would be go down very well in an architectural scenario so and I sometimes

02:16:57.760 --> 02:17:02.400
with I never escape you know you never escape your background in the way you you might try but in

02:17:02.400 --> 02:17:08.480
the end you you find yourself conditioned I'm conscious of being a child of a family of architects

02:17:08.480 --> 02:17:14.160
my grandfather was not an artist he was an architect he built most of his life hospitals

02:17:14.880 --> 02:17:20.640
and this is the design process that is instrumental to serving a function but a function in a larger

02:17:20.640 --> 02:17:25.760
world that he was very deliberately trying to understand and operate in but it was a world

02:17:25.760 --> 02:17:30.800
that he understood as being his own world it was a world that he often found himself to be in

02:17:30.800 --> 02:17:36.880
opposition with for instance in Nazi fascism or also in eastern Germany but it was also the world

02:17:36.880 --> 02:17:42.080
that existed and we need to deal with and build the best possible things in and for my father it

02:17:42.080 --> 02:17:47.840
was different it was a world that he fundamentally rejected and so in some sense to be an architect

02:17:47.840 --> 02:17:55.040
you need to embrace the world that you are in and build within it and to to take roots in it and

02:17:56.080 --> 02:18:01.200
this is in some sense something that also haven't been successful in when I was young so I decided

02:18:01.200 --> 02:18:06.960
not to become an architect but to become an explorer well I mean I think one one of the

02:18:06.960 --> 02:18:11.680
comments that was made and I always think about the Steve Jobs and his response when he was

02:18:12.160 --> 02:18:18.240
he was asked a question by Steve Wozniak and Steve Wozniak said well but what do you do exactly

02:18:18.240 --> 02:18:22.480
because you don't code you don't do this you don't do this and he described himself as being

02:18:22.480 --> 02:18:28.080
a bit like a a conductor of an orchestra you know in a way that's how I see architects in

02:18:28.080 --> 02:18:32.240
the sense because we don't have any specialism you know we are basically we coordinate these

02:18:32.240 --> 02:18:36.640
different sort of a or choreograph these different sort of skill sets and I think that's really what

02:18:36.640 --> 02:18:42.640
it is so in many ways you know I I can see a direct comparison with how you position yourself

02:18:42.640 --> 02:18:47.840
in that sense I mean I I think it's a very it's a very similar sort of position and but I you know

02:18:47.840 --> 02:18:52.160
I think that some of these these these comments that you've raised Joshua they're absolutely

02:18:52.160 --> 02:18:56.640
fascinating I think we need time to digest them and fit them in the system what I would love to

02:18:56.640 --> 02:19:02.240
do above all especially with this particular discussion is to try and find a way of publishing

02:19:02.240 --> 02:19:06.160
the transcript because I mean I think this book that you have to write you must be written because

02:19:06.240 --> 02:19:11.920
I think you've got some fabulous fabulous thoughts that are really creative and original and provocative

02:19:12.720 --> 02:19:16.880
so you know I really appreciate so I appreciate so much your your time and I let me we should let

02:19:16.880 --> 02:19:21.760
you go look after the family now but this is I think almost like we've just opened up a discussion

02:19:21.760 --> 02:19:25.920
and I hope that sometime in the future we can we can take that further and and think through

02:19:25.920 --> 02:19:31.280
these kind of questions because your responses have been very generous and very really provocative

02:19:31.600 --> 02:19:36.720
and stimulating and I feel like you know although we have to pull this we draw this question this

02:19:36.720 --> 02:19:41.360
session to a close it's almost the beginning of something else that we can look forward to so

02:19:41.360 --> 02:19:47.440
I just want to thank Joshua for for fabulous I mean I want to recommend his all his online talks

02:19:47.440 --> 02:19:52.880
as well to have a look at that there is a body of work out there that is that is this hugely

02:19:52.880 --> 02:19:58.720
provocative and hugely stimulating which I am excited by and I also maybe I could finish with

02:19:58.720 --> 02:20:03.520
one one simple question but no I started off the the discussion by saying that I think there is a

02:20:03.520 --> 02:20:08.960
a kind of let's say an emerging theory of intelligence that that is developing in this

02:20:08.960 --> 02:20:15.920
kind of strange area where we're computer science and neuroscience and the world of the commercial

02:20:15.920 --> 02:20:23.280
world and the academic world is coming together do you also see that glimpse of something emerging

02:20:23.280 --> 02:20:28.880
some discourse some theoretical debate that is radically new and radically provocative

02:20:28.880 --> 02:20:35.440
clearly that's why I went into cognitive science in the hope of being part of this new

02:20:35.440 --> 02:20:41.520
synthesis happening between neuroscience and philosophy and artificial intelligence and

02:20:41.520 --> 02:20:48.800
linguistics and psychology and maybe the arts and I think at this moment the synthesis is still

02:20:48.800 --> 02:20:54.800
very partial and in part that's because we teach our model makers and our observers in

02:20:54.800 --> 02:21:00.080
different departments we don't bring them together so we have people that are very good at making

02:21:00.080 --> 02:21:05.760
formal models that can be tested and we have people that are very good at making observations

02:21:05.760 --> 02:21:10.080
and reflecting about the world and seeing it very deeply and these people rarely talk

02:21:11.280 --> 02:21:16.240
and they're rarely think together and this is what excites me to work in this area where

02:21:16.240 --> 02:21:21.440
these two areas intersect and maybe architecture is the right frame of looking at this.

02:21:22.800 --> 02:21:28.320
Nia thank you very much for inviting me I think it was a great conversation to have had today and

02:21:28.320 --> 02:21:37.440
very grateful for your beautiful community and for allowing me to talk about these ideas with you.

02:21:37.440 --> 02:21:40.800
It's fantastic I'm going to finish with one comment which is because I used to be a lesson

02:21:40.800 --> 02:21:48.080
translator and the word I should just say the word computation means to think together and I

02:21:48.080 --> 02:21:51.840
think this is what's been happening today there's been almost like a neurons within neurons a kind

02:21:51.840 --> 02:21:57.760
of global brain it's been fantastic. Yosha fantastic wonderful thank you for your time and sorry for

02:21:57.760 --> 02:22:01.760
getting up so early but this has been a huge contribution to the architectural community

02:22:01.760 --> 02:22:06.560
and I hope that I've helped draw your the attention of your ideas to architects out there because I

02:22:06.560 --> 02:22:11.040
think they're incredibly provocative ideas and I think they've a huge contribution to make to

02:22:11.040 --> 02:22:16.480
architectural thinking itself so thank you Yosha thank you and thank you so much for this it's

02:22:16.480 --> 02:22:21.120
been fabulous and thank you wonderful day thank you and thank you for those team that put this

02:22:21.120 --> 02:22:26.320
together a digital futures team we can't operate without your help thank you so much and see you

02:22:26.320 --> 02:22:31.920
next week thank you everybody thank you bye
