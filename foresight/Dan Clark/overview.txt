Processing Overview for Dan Clark

Checking Dan Clark/Killing the Caveman ï½œ Why COBOL should have died 20 years ago but governments need it NOW.txt
1. COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) is a high-level programming language that was first used in the late 1950s and remains widely used today, particularly in legacy systems within financial institutions like banks and in ATMs (Automated Teller Machines). It's estimated that there are still over 220 billion lines of COBOL code in use.

2. Despite being developed over 60 years ago, COBOL has been slow to be replaced because it powers a significant portion of critical business systems. Around 43% of banking systems rely on COBOL, and 90-95% of ATMs still run on it.

3. COBOL is known for its verbosity, which can lead to very long codebases that are often difficult to read and maintain. Its self-documenting nature means that the code itself serves as documentation, but this can be a double-edged sword as the code can become overly complex and hard to understand.

4. COBOL's verbosity also makes it less efficient compared to modern programming languages like Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, etc. This has led to criticism from computer scientists, including Edsger Dijkstra, who famously said that using COBOL cripples the mind because of its impact on programmers' thinking patterns.

5. The video also demonstrated a simple "Hello World" program in COBOL, highlighting its verbose syntax and the need for many lines of code to accomplish something that can be done much more concisely in modern programming languages.

6. Despite its shortcomings, COBOL continues to be used because of the critical nature of the systems it underpins. However, there is a growing push to migrate COBOL applications to newer technologies to improve efficiency and adapt to modern computing environments.
