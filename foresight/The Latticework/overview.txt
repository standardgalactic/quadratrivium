Processing Overview for The Latticework
============================
Checking The Latticework/Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned (with author Ken Stanley).txt
1. **Dissemination of the Idea**: Cal Newport, the author of "Deep Work," wonders why his book hasn't gone viral across the entire spectrum of society. He initially expected a mixed reaction, including some backlash from gatekeepers who might feel threatened by its message advocating for deep, focused work over busywork and distractions. However, he found that even those gatekeepers often come around after reading the book, realizing its value.

2. **Impact of the Message**: The core message of "Deep Work" seems to resonate with many at both personal and institutional levels, yet there is a significant gap in its adoption by institutions, which Newport finds disappointing. He acknowledges that changing organizational culture is challenging but encourages efforts in this direction.

3. **Instances of Implementation**: Newport mentions a few instances where the principles from "Deep Work" have been implemented, particularly by small startups or companies modeled after its recommendations. However, there are not many large-scale success stories yet.

4. **Further Collaboration**: Ed and Ken discuss the possibility of staying in touch to share experiences, case studies, and further ideas for spreading the message of "Deep Work." Newport is open to this idea and sees value in building a community of practitioners who can demonstrate the benefits of deep work.

5. **Next Steps**: The group agrees that it would be beneficial to document and share how individuals and organizations are applying the concepts from "Deep Work" in their lives, which could help in promoting the book's message more effectively. This could potentially lead to more institutional change and a broader acceptance of deep work principles.
