1. **NAND Gate Universality**: A NAND gate is considered universal because with only NAND gates, you can create any logical function or compute any binary operation. This is due to the fact that a NAND gate can perform both AND and OR operations, as well as inversions (NOT), by appropriately setting its inputs.

2. **Complementing Inputs**: By complementing the inputs of a function with NAND gates (flipping all 1s to 0s and all 0s to 1s), you can reverse the logic, effectively computing the logical NOT of the original function. This is because the truth table of a NAND operation is a flipped version of an AND operation.

3. **NOR Gate Universality**: Similarly, a NOR gate is also universal, meaning it can compute any logical function, although it will require different configurations compared to NAND gates.

4. **Turing's Contribution**: The concept of a universal gate is closely related to the work of Alan Turing, who laid the foundation for what it means to compute something with his theoretical construct called a Turing machine. A Turing machine can simulate any computational logic and thus is considered universal as well.

5. **Practicality**: While NAND (and NOR) gates are universal in theory, using them for practical applications like writing an operating system or video game code would be highly impractical due to the sheer number of gates required. Instead, higher-level abstractions are used in actual hardware and software implementations.

6. **Allen Turing's Legacy**: Alan Turing's work has had a profound impact on computer science and the understanding of what it means to compute something. His legacy is celebrated for his foresight and contributions to the field.
