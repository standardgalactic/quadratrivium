00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
114% this is Anton and today we're going to be discussing some of the new propositions

00:04.560 --> 00:09.840
in regards to the unusual phenomena that could be happening in many different black holes out

00:09.840 --> 00:15.200
there. Phenomena that the scientists are now exploring using quantum physics and something

00:15.200 --> 00:20.080
that can actually help us understand why certain galaxies have certain features and what happens

00:20.080 --> 00:25.680
in certain black holes that spin really really fast. But before we discuss the black holes it's

00:25.680 --> 00:30.720
actually important to understand where a lot of these ideas originally come from. They do come

00:30.720 --> 00:36.400
from quantum physics and specifically from this really unusual state of matter usually referred

00:36.400 --> 00:43.600
to as BEC back or Bose-Einstein condensate. Something that happens to certain particles of gas

00:43.600 --> 00:48.800
as you cool them down and here these particles have to be what's known as bosons. Usually this

00:48.800 --> 00:54.080
is particles of helium. As you start to cool them down each particle starts to acquire bigger and

00:54.080 --> 00:59.600
bigger wave function and eventually each of these wave functions start to sort of interact

00:59.600 --> 01:05.760
and then even joins in creating one single wave function that sort of acts as a single object

01:05.760 --> 01:10.960
and this is what we refer to as BEC. This is essentially how the scientists have been studying

01:10.960 --> 01:15.440
various quantum effects and this particular state of matter has even been created on the

01:15.440 --> 01:19.840
International Space Station and we've discussed this in a video a few years ago. But the most

01:19.840 --> 01:24.800
important part about this state of matter is that it really doesn't act like classical matter

01:24.800 --> 01:30.960
at all anymore. It acts like quantum wave and its behavior and its interaction with other stuff

01:30.960 --> 01:36.160
can actually no longer be predicted by classical physics. For example if you do something to this

01:36.160 --> 01:40.560
matter and you expect certain type of reaction based on what we know about, well I just say

01:40.560 --> 01:45.760
normal helium gas, the results are always going to be very surprising. It almost always acts in a

01:45.760 --> 01:51.280
way that's only explainable through quantum physics and because of this in the last few decades

01:51.280 --> 01:56.240
BEC has been one of the most exciting prospects in order to learn more about quantum physics

01:56.240 --> 02:01.200
and to try to understand how things work in the universe. But while studying these BECs not so long

02:01.200 --> 02:07.120
ago I guess around six years ago back in 2016 the scientists discovered a new feature of these

02:07.120 --> 02:13.440
unusual BECs specifically the ones that tend to spin really fast. So in classical physics for any

02:13.440 --> 02:18.480
kind of a spinning liquid or a spinning gas we can generally predict exactly what's going to

02:18.480 --> 02:24.480
happen to it as it spins faster and faster. As a matter of fact hydrodynamics and aerodynamics

02:24.480 --> 02:30.800
explain a lot of different spinning water and gas particles with extreme precision but for these

02:30.800 --> 02:36.640
quantum particles for these BECs things are very very different. A typical BEC as it starts spinning

02:36.640 --> 02:41.760
around starts exhibiting entirely different structures and entire different properties

02:41.760 --> 02:46.240
something that nobody could predict until the scientists started to do it. They actually start

02:46.240 --> 02:51.600
producing what the scientists today refer to as vortices but even here they're not at all similar

02:51.600 --> 02:56.880
to the ones we find in the water they don't act like this at all. Here's a microscopic image

02:56.880 --> 03:03.120
of what they really look like this right here is a spinning back spinning those Einstein condensate

03:03.120 --> 03:08.800
and each of those tiny dots you see those are tiny vortices that appear inside the condensate.

03:08.800 --> 03:14.560
But here we're talking about a kind of a quantized vortex that's formed with very unusual patterns

03:14.560 --> 03:20.000
or almost resembling a crystal. Here are some other examples from similar experiments but

03:20.000 --> 03:25.440
with the back of different size and so as you can see this phenomenon seems to appear in any kind of

03:25.440 --> 03:31.920
quantum material that starts to spin and when analyzed this particular lattice store looks like this

03:31.920 --> 03:37.120
it has a very specific order and it does seem to have its own physics that it obeys using quantum

03:37.120 --> 03:41.680
mechanics. Today the scientists believe that these vortices can actually help us explain

03:41.680 --> 03:46.800
different phenomena such as superfluidity and superconductivity but even though the scientists

03:46.800 --> 03:51.040
have been studying them for many years they're not there just yet. You can actually see some other

03:51.040 --> 03:54.960
visual examples in one of the links in the description with quite a lot of different

03:54.960 --> 04:00.400
recreations of what happens to these backs as they start spinning but these patterns are not

04:00.400 --> 04:04.560
permanent and they do change with time for example in this case it lasted for about 40

04:04.560 --> 04:08.880
seconds before changing into something a little bit different so these are definitely not permanent

04:08.880 --> 04:13.760
structures. But what does it have to do with black holes? Well when it comes to trying to explain

04:13.760 --> 04:19.200
what black holes are a lot of modern physicists realize that modern physics cannot explain what

04:19.200 --> 04:24.480
happens inside the black holes. For example Einstein's relativity only explains what happens right

04:24.480 --> 04:30.400
until the event horizon with everything after this basically becoming infinity which in physics just

04:30.400 --> 04:34.960
means that we don't really have a good explanation and so the scientists believe that quantum physics

04:34.960 --> 04:40.480
and potentially the idea known as quantum gravity could provide some answers and what happens inside

04:40.480 --> 04:46.400
black holes could be entirely quantum in nature in other words black holes could be basically very

04:46.400 --> 04:52.080
unusual quantum states of matter although naturally at the moment nobody really knows exactly how any

04:52.080 --> 04:58.400
of this works but there is at least one hypothesis and it does involve the hypothetical gravitons.

04:58.480 --> 05:02.880
The particles at some scientists believe could explain how gravity works as well

05:02.880 --> 05:08.720
and in this case because this is also a boson it can also create backs very similar to the ones that

05:08.720 --> 05:13.920
I showed you previously and thus exhibiting very similar effects especially when it starts spinning

05:13.920 --> 05:19.360
and so a few years ago the scientists proposed that well maybe backs with gravitons could explain

05:19.360 --> 05:24.640
certain types of black holes with the most recent paper that was just released going further establishing

05:24.640 --> 05:29.760
that for a spinning black hole assuming that it's made out of quantum gravitons it can actually start

05:29.760 --> 05:35.440
forming these vortices as well with each individual vortex then producing a lot of other additional

05:35.440 --> 05:40.880
effects we observe including very powerful magnetic lines that currently do not have a really good

05:40.880 --> 05:45.600
explanation otherwise or in other words the implication here is really simple some black holes

05:45.600 --> 05:51.520
or maybe even all black holes could be these very unusual boson condensates and might possess

05:51.520 --> 05:56.640
very similar properties to what we actually discover in these experiments as well even showing

05:56.640 --> 06:02.640
that a black hole that's spinning can also be described using similar physics but as a graviton

06:02.640 --> 06:08.800
boson condensate that possesses the vorticity implying that this right here is just a bigger

06:08.800 --> 06:13.680
version of what the scientists were able to take pictures of before and if correct it might provide

06:13.680 --> 06:18.560
certain answers for a lot of different mysteries of black holes first of all it would suggest that a

06:18.560 --> 06:24.240
very fast spinning black hole would be really stable and would not emit any Hawking radiation

06:24.240 --> 06:29.200
in other words it would not evaporate and would actually remain relatively constant at the same

06:29.200 --> 06:34.800
time they show that each individual vortex traps a lot of the magnetic field lines which end up

06:34.800 --> 06:40.000
releasing very specific signatures that will be impossible to produce otherwise and that can

06:40.000 --> 06:45.120
actually be experimentally detected by observing certain black holes which of course implies that

06:45.120 --> 06:50.400
this is not just a hypothesis it's a testable hypothesis that some future studies could maybe

06:50.400 --> 06:55.760
test if very specific observations are made at the same time this could also explain why

06:55.760 --> 07:02.000
certain galaxies and specifically certain galactic nuclei tend to have very powerful magnetic fields

07:02.000 --> 07:06.880
that otherwise are kind of difficult to explain as a matter of fact a lot of the magnetic fields

07:06.880 --> 07:13.280
in various galaxies could maybe stem from these unusual effects from these unusual spinning quantum

07:13.280 --> 07:19.200
black holes but i guess more importantly it also adds a completely new property to a typical black

07:19.200 --> 07:24.880
hole today black holes are generally explained by three different properties we have mass we also

07:24.880 --> 07:30.720
have charge and lastly we have spin so we know that all black holes spin they all have mass

07:30.720 --> 07:36.560
and they all possess at least some charge but now there seems to be a fourth one vorticity

07:36.560 --> 07:41.200
this could also be one of the features if the scientists behind the study are somewhat correct

07:41.200 --> 07:46.400
and if black holes are indeed quantum objects exhibiting quantum features similar to what we

07:46.400 --> 07:52.240
find in both Einstein condensates here on earth so definitely a pretty exciting proposition but

07:52.240 --> 07:56.240
something that we're not going to be able to test until some of the future very powerful

07:56.240 --> 08:01.920
observations from extremely distant black holes that we know most likely spin so definitely not

08:01.920 --> 08:07.760
testable anytime soon but back in general always create so many different surprises as a matter

08:07.760 --> 08:11.840
of fact we'll discuss some of them in videos you can find in the description below and so this

08:11.840 --> 08:16.720
unusual state of matter can definitely help us resolve a lot of different mysteries in the universe

08:16.720 --> 08:21.680
that would be very difficult to explain otherwise because this right here allows us to test and to

08:21.680 --> 08:28.240
observe quantum effects by using actual microscopes and by using larger objects something that normally

08:28.240 --> 08:33.520
only happens on subatomic scales but for now i guess we're not going to know if this is correct

08:34.160 --> 08:38.320
