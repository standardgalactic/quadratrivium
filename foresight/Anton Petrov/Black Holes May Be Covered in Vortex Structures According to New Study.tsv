0	4560	114% this is Anton and today we're going to be discussing some of the new propositions
4560	9840	in regards to the unusual phenomena that could be happening in many different black holes out
9840	15200	there. Phenomena that the scientists are now exploring using quantum physics and something
15200	20080	that can actually help us understand why certain galaxies have certain features and what happens
20080	25680	in certain black holes that spin really really fast. But before we discuss the black holes it's
25680	30720	actually important to understand where a lot of these ideas originally come from. They do come
30720	36400	from quantum physics and specifically from this really unusual state of matter usually referred
36400	43600	to as BEC back or Bose-Einstein condensate. Something that happens to certain particles of gas
43600	48800	as you cool them down and here these particles have to be what's known as bosons. Usually this
48800	54080	is particles of helium. As you start to cool them down each particle starts to acquire bigger and
54080	59600	bigger wave function and eventually each of these wave functions start to sort of interact
59600	65760	and then even joins in creating one single wave function that sort of acts as a single object
65760	70960	and this is what we refer to as BEC. This is essentially how the scientists have been studying
70960	75440	various quantum effects and this particular state of matter has even been created on the
75440	79840	International Space Station and we've discussed this in a video a few years ago. But the most
79840	84800	important part about this state of matter is that it really doesn't act like classical matter
84800	90960	at all anymore. It acts like quantum wave and its behavior and its interaction with other stuff
90960	96160	can actually no longer be predicted by classical physics. For example if you do something to this
96160	100560	matter and you expect certain type of reaction based on what we know about, well I just say
100560	105760	normal helium gas, the results are always going to be very surprising. It almost always acts in a
105760	111280	way that's only explainable through quantum physics and because of this in the last few decades
111280	116240	BEC has been one of the most exciting prospects in order to learn more about quantum physics
116240	121200	and to try to understand how things work in the universe. But while studying these BECs not so long
121200	127120	ago I guess around six years ago back in 2016 the scientists discovered a new feature of these
127120	133440	unusual BECs specifically the ones that tend to spin really fast. So in classical physics for any
133440	138480	kind of a spinning liquid or a spinning gas we can generally predict exactly what's going to
138480	144480	happen to it as it spins faster and faster. As a matter of fact hydrodynamics and aerodynamics
144480	150800	explain a lot of different spinning water and gas particles with extreme precision but for these
150800	156640	quantum particles for these BECs things are very very different. A typical BEC as it starts spinning
156640	161760	around starts exhibiting entirely different structures and entire different properties
161760	166240	something that nobody could predict until the scientists started to do it. They actually start
166240	171600	producing what the scientists today refer to as vortices but even here they're not at all similar
171600	176880	to the ones we find in the water they don't act like this at all. Here's a microscopic image
176880	183120	of what they really look like this right here is a spinning back spinning those Einstein condensate
183120	188800	and each of those tiny dots you see those are tiny vortices that appear inside the condensate.
188800	194560	But here we're talking about a kind of a quantized vortex that's formed with very unusual patterns
194560	200000	or almost resembling a crystal. Here are some other examples from similar experiments but
200000	205440	with the back of different size and so as you can see this phenomenon seems to appear in any kind of
205440	211920	quantum material that starts to spin and when analyzed this particular lattice store looks like this
211920	217120	it has a very specific order and it does seem to have its own physics that it obeys using quantum
217120	221680	mechanics. Today the scientists believe that these vortices can actually help us explain
221680	226800	different phenomena such as superfluidity and superconductivity but even though the scientists
226800	231040	have been studying them for many years they're not there just yet. You can actually see some other
231040	234960	visual examples in one of the links in the description with quite a lot of different
234960	240400	recreations of what happens to these backs as they start spinning but these patterns are not
240400	244560	permanent and they do change with time for example in this case it lasted for about 40
244560	248880	seconds before changing into something a little bit different so these are definitely not permanent
248880	253760	structures. But what does it have to do with black holes? Well when it comes to trying to explain
253760	259200	what black holes are a lot of modern physicists realize that modern physics cannot explain what
259200	264480	happens inside the black holes. For example Einstein's relativity only explains what happens right
264480	270400	until the event horizon with everything after this basically becoming infinity which in physics just
270400	274960	means that we don't really have a good explanation and so the scientists believe that quantum physics
274960	280480	and potentially the idea known as quantum gravity could provide some answers and what happens inside
280480	286400	black holes could be entirely quantum in nature in other words black holes could be basically very
286400	292080	unusual quantum states of matter although naturally at the moment nobody really knows exactly how any
292080	298400	of this works but there is at least one hypothesis and it does involve the hypothetical gravitons.
298480	302880	The particles at some scientists believe could explain how gravity works as well
302880	308720	and in this case because this is also a boson it can also create backs very similar to the ones that
308720	313920	I showed you previously and thus exhibiting very similar effects especially when it starts spinning
313920	319360	and so a few years ago the scientists proposed that well maybe backs with gravitons could explain
319360	324640	certain types of black holes with the most recent paper that was just released going further establishing
324640	329760	that for a spinning black hole assuming that it's made out of quantum gravitons it can actually start
329760	335440	forming these vortices as well with each individual vortex then producing a lot of other additional
335440	340880	effects we observe including very powerful magnetic lines that currently do not have a really good
340880	345600	explanation otherwise or in other words the implication here is really simple some black holes
345600	351520	or maybe even all black holes could be these very unusual boson condensates and might possess
351520	356640	very similar properties to what we actually discover in these experiments as well even showing
356640	362640	that a black hole that's spinning can also be described using similar physics but as a graviton
362640	368800	boson condensate that possesses the vorticity implying that this right here is just a bigger
368800	373680	version of what the scientists were able to take pictures of before and if correct it might provide
373680	378560	certain answers for a lot of different mysteries of black holes first of all it would suggest that a
378560	384240	very fast spinning black hole would be really stable and would not emit any Hawking radiation
384240	389200	in other words it would not evaporate and would actually remain relatively constant at the same
389200	394800	time they show that each individual vortex traps a lot of the magnetic field lines which end up
394800	400000	releasing very specific signatures that will be impossible to produce otherwise and that can
400000	405120	actually be experimentally detected by observing certain black holes which of course implies that
405120	410400	this is not just a hypothesis it's a testable hypothesis that some future studies could maybe
410400	415760	test if very specific observations are made at the same time this could also explain why
415760	422000	certain galaxies and specifically certain galactic nuclei tend to have very powerful magnetic fields
422000	426880	that otherwise are kind of difficult to explain as a matter of fact a lot of the magnetic fields
426880	433280	in various galaxies could maybe stem from these unusual effects from these unusual spinning quantum
433280	439200	black holes but i guess more importantly it also adds a completely new property to a typical black
439200	444880	hole today black holes are generally explained by three different properties we have mass we also
444880	450720	have charge and lastly we have spin so we know that all black holes spin they all have mass
450720	456560	and they all possess at least some charge but now there seems to be a fourth one vorticity
456560	461200	this could also be one of the features if the scientists behind the study are somewhat correct
461200	466400	and if black holes are indeed quantum objects exhibiting quantum features similar to what we
466400	472240	find in both Einstein condensates here on earth so definitely a pretty exciting proposition but
472240	476240	something that we're not going to be able to test until some of the future very powerful
476240	481920	observations from extremely distant black holes that we know most likely spin so definitely not
481920	487760	testable anytime soon but back in general always create so many different surprises as a matter
487760	491840	of fact we'll discuss some of them in videos you can find in the description below and so this
491840	496720	unusual state of matter can definitely help us resolve a lot of different mysteries in the universe
496720	501680	that would be very difficult to explain otherwise because this right here allows us to test and to
501680	508240	observe quantum effects by using actual microscopes and by using larger objects something that normally
508240	513520	only happens on subatomic scales but for now i guess we're not going to know if this is correct
514160	518320	and so until future studies thank you for watching subscribe check out some of the previous videos
