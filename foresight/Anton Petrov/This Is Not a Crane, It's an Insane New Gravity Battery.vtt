00:00.000 --> 00:03.760
Hello, wonderful person, this is Anton, and today we're going to be discussing what's

00:03.760 --> 00:10.380
known as a gravity battery, and specifically this right here, this unusual looking tower

00:10.380 --> 00:15.520
that's in reality a gravity battery, something that a company known as Energy Vault has now

00:15.520 --> 00:20.040
actually developed and is trying to sell to a lot of different bidders.

00:20.040 --> 00:24.000
But more specifically, we're going to be discussing the idea behind these gravity batteries,

00:24.000 --> 00:29.200
how they operate, and more importantly, how they might transform the future of humanity.

00:29.200 --> 00:32.240
But let's start small, actually this small.

00:32.240 --> 00:36.520
Now you might have seen a grandfather clock before, but this is actually a good example

00:36.520 --> 00:41.760
of how humans have learned to use gravity to operate something and to produce energy.

00:41.760 --> 00:47.080
The pendulum in the clock here generates all of its energy from essentially the gravity

00:47.080 --> 00:48.080
of planet Earth.

00:48.080 --> 00:53.640
And this idea of gravity as energy allows us to produce things like, for example, hydroplants.

00:53.640 --> 00:59.800
A hydro plant, or a dam, operates entirely on the idea of gravity generating energy,

00:59.800 --> 01:04.200
with the motion of water generating energy by driving the turbines.

01:04.200 --> 01:08.080
And not so long ago, I actually went on a kind of a tour trying to explore different ways

01:08.080 --> 01:12.960
energy is generated here in South Korea, because I actually wanted to make a video about all

01:12.960 --> 01:13.960
of this.

01:13.960 --> 01:18.160
Unfortunately, COVID happened, and so all of these plants are currently off limits.

01:18.160 --> 01:22.240
But during that time, when I was exploring various plants, I discovered some really really

01:22.240 --> 01:26.860
awesome ideas and some really interesting constructions that are currently used to either

01:26.860 --> 01:29.640
generate or store energy.

01:29.640 --> 01:35.480
For example, Korea actually has the world's largest tidal wave energy generator.

01:35.480 --> 01:37.800
It generates energy through the tides.

01:37.800 --> 01:40.520
And we'll talk more about this in some of the future videos, because I actually wanted

01:40.520 --> 01:43.280
to dedicate an entire video to this.

01:43.280 --> 01:48.280
But by basically using the tides to control the flow of water, it's possible to generate

01:48.280 --> 01:53.680
a lot of energy in the same way that it's usually done in a hydro plant or a dam.

01:53.680 --> 01:57.240
And so a lot of countries around the world right now are basically trying to find new

01:57.240 --> 02:00.680
ways to generate energy without the use of fossil fuels.

02:00.680 --> 02:04.000
That's obviously the priority for a lot of countries out there.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.160
But generating energy is one thing.

02:06.160 --> 02:08.920
The other thing is how do you actually store it?

02:08.920 --> 02:14.400
And storing energy, especially renewable energy, is a completely different problem that currently

02:14.400 --> 02:16.840
does not have a very good solution.

02:16.840 --> 02:21.920
And that's mostly because a lot of renewable energies like solar energy or wind energy

02:21.920 --> 02:23.840
is not really constant.

02:23.840 --> 02:28.360
It usually deviates with time and sometimes depends on certain conditions.

02:28.360 --> 02:31.720
For example, solar energy obviously does not work at night.

02:31.720 --> 02:35.960
And so the only way to make this work is to collect a lot of energy during the day and

02:35.960 --> 02:40.760
then store a lot of energy for the nighttime so that it can also be used at night.

02:40.760 --> 02:45.160
But this obviously requires a lot of batteries and an extremely efficient way of storing

02:45.160 --> 02:46.520
all of this.

02:46.520 --> 02:50.200
Chemical batteries, unfortunately, are not good enough, especially in certain climates

02:50.200 --> 02:55.200
such as in extremely hot climates or extremely cold climates where chemical batteries usually

02:55.200 --> 02:56.960
discharge very quickly.

02:56.960 --> 03:01.200
And so during my mini tour of different power plants, including nuclear power plants, I've

03:01.200 --> 03:05.720
got to talk to some experts who actually told me how a lot of this works.

03:05.720 --> 03:09.440
And it's really interesting how most of the countries solve this problem.

03:09.440 --> 03:13.920
They usually rely on gravity for providing extra battery storage.

03:13.920 --> 03:18.920
And specifically they normally use sort of like the reverse of what a typical hydro plant

03:18.920 --> 03:19.920
is.

03:19.920 --> 03:24.760
It's known as PSH, pumped storage hydroelectricity.

03:24.760 --> 03:26.920
And the idea is really simple.

03:26.920 --> 03:32.120
During daytime, for example, you use all of this extra energy to drive a lot of water

03:32.120 --> 03:36.480
uphill and then store it in some sort of a reservoir on top.

03:36.480 --> 03:40.000
Normally this is done with some sort of a mountain and some sort of a reservoir on top

03:40.000 --> 03:43.880
of the mountain with different countries using different techniques.

03:43.880 --> 03:48.440
For example, here's a picture of a pumped storage plant in Lithuania that essentially

03:48.440 --> 03:53.000
stores extra water right here in this reservoir and will then release the water when the energy

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
is required.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.440
And here's another one from Wales.

03:56.440 --> 04:02.200
This has a very funky Welsh name that I don't think I'm going to try to pronounce.

04:02.200 --> 04:06.840
And so once all of this water is collected somewhere on top, at night the flow reverses

04:06.840 --> 04:10.680
and all of this water can now generate extra electricity needed.

04:10.680 --> 04:15.520
And so today this is the most widely used gravity battery often used in conjunction

04:15.520 --> 04:21.240
with a lot of renewable energy, usually massive solar power plants, but sometimes also wind

04:21.240 --> 04:26.320
power plants or a lot of other power plants that require additional energy storage.

04:26.320 --> 04:30.840
And generally speaking, a lot of these batteries are designed to work for at least 12 hours

04:30.840 --> 04:31.840
without stopping.

04:31.840 --> 04:35.160
So basically they have enough energy for approximately half a day.

04:35.160 --> 04:37.960
And today there are quite a lot of them out there.

04:37.960 --> 04:43.000
Only a third of them are in the United States, with a total storage capacity of US alone

04:43.000 --> 04:46.600
being approximately 250 gigawatt hours.

04:46.600 --> 04:48.040
That's a lot of energy.

04:48.040 --> 04:52.320
But there's another country that has even more of them, and that's Switzerland.

04:52.320 --> 04:57.880
And the reason why Switzerland basically explains the problem with this type of energy, or this

04:57.880 --> 04:59.680
type of energy storage.

04:59.680 --> 05:04.160
The type of a gravity generator that we're talking about here requires mountains and

05:04.160 --> 05:06.320
it requires a lot of water.

05:06.320 --> 05:10.160
Without mountains and water, it would be extremely difficult to produce an efficient

05:10.160 --> 05:15.640
gravity battery, or at least a PSH, a pump storage hydroelectricity.

05:15.640 --> 05:20.320
And so most countries with mountains and water usually have no problem producing these, which

05:20.320 --> 05:24.600
is why there are quite a lot of them in South Korea, a lot of them in America, and quite

05:24.600 --> 05:26.240
a lot of them in Switzerland.

05:26.240 --> 05:31.840
But if a country is more or less flat, or if it's a desert, it becomes kind of impossible

05:31.840 --> 05:36.080
to produce this simply because there are just no resources and it would be way more expensive

05:36.080 --> 05:39.760
to produce this than even a chemical type of a battery.

05:39.760 --> 05:43.680
And by the way, fun fact, but the first one of these batteries was originally produced

05:43.680 --> 05:49.240
in Switzerland as well, back in 1907, so this is a super old technology.

05:49.240 --> 05:51.200
And so anyway, how do you solve this?

05:51.200 --> 05:55.600
If a country has no mountains and no water, something else has to be used.

05:55.600 --> 06:00.480
And that's where these two new startups decided to solve this problem by producing something

06:00.480 --> 06:02.000
quite brilliant actually.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.640
And the first startup is EnergyVolt, and this is what their battery looks like.

06:06.640 --> 06:11.440
And even though it might not look like a battery, it actually can store quite a lot of energy,

06:11.440 --> 06:14.440
even more than some of these hydroelectric ones.

06:14.440 --> 06:18.840
And the design itself, despite being kind of ugly, is modifiable and will most likely

06:18.840 --> 06:20.080
change in time.

06:20.080 --> 06:24.440
Okay, so how exactly does this work, and what exactly are they trying to achieve here?

06:24.440 --> 06:29.920
Well, in essence, it's an automated crane that picks up various blocks and stores them

06:29.920 --> 06:31.080
on top.

06:31.080 --> 06:34.280
But these blocks acting as potential energy.

06:34.280 --> 06:39.720
And so as extra energy is generated by the wind turbines or by solar power plants, all

06:39.720 --> 06:45.200
of this is stored and eventually deposited right on top of the crane itself.

06:45.200 --> 06:50.480
Then during nighttime, for example, or when there's no wind, it starts doing the opposite.

06:50.480 --> 06:56.320
It starts to slowly bring all of these blocks down and thus generates energy simply through

06:56.320 --> 07:00.080
the action of gravity pulling on all of these blocks.

07:00.080 --> 07:04.760
And the way that all of this is designed right now, it's entirely automated and runs with

07:04.760 --> 07:07.560
almost no supervision whatsoever.

07:07.560 --> 07:12.680
And so instead of using water, it uses either concrete or even some sort of recycled heavy

07:12.680 --> 07:13.880
material.

07:13.880 --> 07:18.160
And interestingly enough, it's able to store quite a lot of energy, and it's also able

07:18.160 --> 07:21.200
to produce quite a lot of energy when it needs to be produced.

07:21.200 --> 07:26.480
So the capacity here is pretty high, with a total output of approximately 5 megawatt,

07:26.480 --> 07:29.080
meaning that it can supply energy to a small town.

07:29.280 --> 07:33.560
And as you can see from this video, they already have a first function in prototype, currently

07:33.560 --> 07:36.160
located in one of the cities in Switzerland.

07:36.160 --> 07:40.840
This tower is approximately 110 meters in height and is able to move very massive concrete

07:40.840 --> 07:43.960
blocks, approximately 35 ton each.

07:43.960 --> 07:48.200
The total storage here is approximately 80 megawatt hours of energy.

07:48.200 --> 07:52.040
More importantly, this company has officially signed their first commercial deal, meaning

07:52.040 --> 07:56.400
that they're going to be producing these for some of the energy companies in Europe.

07:56.400 --> 08:00.880
And at the moment, they're designed to be powered entirely by solar energy and then

08:00.880 --> 08:03.880
store all of this energy for 910 years.

08:03.880 --> 08:08.360
And from what we know so far, the next tower is going to be somewhere in Louisiana, with

08:08.360 --> 08:12.520
a total storage capacity of nearly 500 megawatt hour.

08:12.520 --> 08:13.520
That's a lot of storage.

08:13.520 --> 08:16.880
It will be enough to power a somewhat small city.

08:16.880 --> 08:21.160
And it's expected to start operating sometime next year in 2022.

08:21.160 --> 08:25.360
And they also are planning to build at least one in Ohio and at least one in Canada somewhere

08:25.360 --> 08:26.840
in British Columbia.

08:26.840 --> 08:30.600
So this is a super exciting project and I'm really looking forward to see where all of

08:30.600 --> 08:31.600
this goes.

08:31.600 --> 08:36.880
And interestingly, this is even a little bit more efficient than the PSH I previously mentioned.

08:36.880 --> 08:41.640
Unlike the hydroelectric energy storage, this has slightly more efficiency in terms of storing

08:41.640 --> 08:45.640
energy and in terms of then retrieving it from the blocks themselves.

08:45.640 --> 08:52.700
The overall efficiency here is approximately 85% versus about 75% for a hydroelectric plant.

08:52.700 --> 08:54.640
But that's not the only company doing this.

08:54.920 --> 08:59.600
There's a company somewhere in the UK known as Gravitricity and they have a somewhat similar

08:59.600 --> 09:03.080
but a slightly different concept of gravity energy.

09:03.080 --> 09:08.480
They're planning to rely on abandoned, very deep mine shafts, usually several kilometers

09:08.480 --> 09:09.480
in depth.

09:09.480 --> 09:13.200
And instead of using a crane and a bunch of blocks, they're going to be lowering one

09:13.200 --> 09:17.920
single block deep into the mine shaft with the block itself being anywhere from about

09:17.920 --> 09:21.640
500 to even 5000 tons in mass.

09:21.640 --> 09:26.200
And by essentially moving this block just a few centimeters deep into the mine, it's

09:26.200 --> 09:31.480
able to generate a tremendous amount of electricity or vice versa, it's able to store a tremendous

09:31.480 --> 09:34.880
amount of electricity as the block is lifted from the bottom.

09:34.880 --> 09:39.120
With the current model being able to store approximately 10 megawatt hour of energy.

09:39.120 --> 09:44.000
But this particular project is still in its infancy and is still looking for more investors.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.860
Specifically though, it's also sort of reliant on these abandoned mines.

09:47.860 --> 09:51.480
So obviously only some countries are going to be able to produce this.

09:51.480 --> 09:56.860
Regardless, it shows us that this is a really exciting time for innovation and for a lot

09:56.860 --> 10:01.280
of new technologies and a lot of new concepts that are going to be appearing just to help

10:01.280 --> 10:07.160
us transition from the idea of fossil fuels and chemical energy to the idea of renewable

10:07.160 --> 10:09.600
energy and renewable storage.

10:09.600 --> 10:14.000
And so I'm actually kind of excited to see where all of this goes in the next five years.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.040
But I guess until we learn more or until some other company invents or designs something

10:18.040 --> 10:20.520
else incredible, that's all I wanted to mention.

10:20.520 --> 10:23.880
You can find all the links for each of the companies and their projects in the description

10:27.080 --> 10:30.760
space and sciences and maybe come back tomorrow to learn something else.

Maybe support us on Patreon by joining a channel membership or by buying the wonderful present

10:34.040 --> 10:35.960
t-shirt you can find in the description.

10:35.960 --> 10:40.920
Stay wonderful, I'll see you tomorrow and as always, bye bye.

10:40.920 --> 10:42.680
To Festiniog Power Station.
