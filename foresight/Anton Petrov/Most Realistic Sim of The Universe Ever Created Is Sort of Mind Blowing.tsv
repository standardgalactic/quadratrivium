0	5040	Hello and for person this is Anton and today we are going to be discussing the creation of the
5040	10720	most complex to date simulation of the entire universe. The simulation that was recently
10720	15680	created by the scientists in Japan that sort of dwarfs everything else that ever existed.
16320	20720	But I also wanted to discuss some of the previous simulations and what all of this is for
20720	24800	and what the scientists are trying to discover by doing all of this over and over.
24800	28880	And let's actually start with some of the more basic simulations I've been using on the channel
28880	33760	for several years, the ones you can technically purchase and use yourselves. So for example,
33760	39520	universe sandbox and the beautiful space engine are both meant to simulate the universe to some
39520	45280	extent, with both of them doing a pretty good job, at least when it comes to smaller patches of the
45280	50320	universe, such as for example, taking a look at what happens in the solar system, or trying to
50320	55840	imagine what a typical galaxy or possibly a global cluster looks like. But they both obviously have
55840	61280	their shortcomings. For space engine, it's the fact that things here are more or less static.
61280	66480	So for example, a star system is not going to be interacting with another star system.
66480	71200	And so in this global cluster, for example, nothing is actually moving anywhere. Everything
71200	76960	here is more or less in the same spot. Now that's obviously because of the limitations
76960	82960	and the inability to potentially simulate this on the grandiose scales like what we have right here.
82960	88080	Now, universe sandbox does almost the opposite. It tries to simulate the gravitational interactions
88080	93280	between various objects. But depending on how powerful your computer is, even here you're going
93280	98800	to start reaching your limitations pretty quickly. So in this simulation, once these moons start to
98800	104240	collide and start creating more particles, that's when my computer can no longer really handle it.
104240	109760	But when it comes to actual scientific simulations, normally this required a super computer because
109760	114800	of the limitations you can clearly see right here. And so in the last decade or so, a lot of
114800	119520	different scientific teams started to create their own simulations, such as this one right here,
119520	124960	known as the universe machine, that tried to use as many cores as possible in order to create the
124960	130800	most realistic simulation of as many objects as possible, interacting as they would in real life.
130800	137360	And every few years, these so called universes in a box or universes in a bottle have improved
137360	143120	so dramatically and have improved so much that the effects they're showing us in real time allow
143120	147840	the scientists to discover various features of galactic and star formation that they actually
147840	152320	did not know existed. And in the last few years, I've been using a lot of these videos like the one
152320	158080	you see right here that were originally created back in 2019 by the biggest and the most complex
158080	164080	simulation of the universe in the box. This is known as the illustrious project. This project is
164080	168080	freely available on the website in the description. And the cool thing here is that if you were to
168080	173360	click on the explorer, you sort of get the snapshot of one of the simulations where you can sort of
173360	180160	zoom in and see one of the extremely detailed simulations of one of these universes in a box.
180160	184160	That also allows you to change various properties of what you're actually looking at,
184160	189600	and allows you to visualize what a lot of the interaction between galaxies usually ends up
189600	194480	producing. Now I've previously discussed this project and the simulation in the video from
194480	200160	approximately two years ago, but just to summarize, the biggest simulation today involves creating a
200160	206400	tiny universe that's approximately 230 million light years across and contain tens of thousands
206400	211840	of different galaxies with a tremendous amount of detail and a lot of interacting particles.
211840	218400	Here there was approximately 20 billion particles representing dark matter, gas, stars and a lot of
218400	223840	supermassive black holes. With the actual simulation lasting around 13.8 billion years,
223840	229280	representing the age of the universe. And the point of the simulation was to try to build a
229280	234480	representation of the universe as it evolved since the beginning of the Big Bang, allowing the
234480	239840	scientists to visualize how all of these structures interact and what exactly they end up forming,
239840	244960	both in terms of large-scale structures, but also in terms of the smaller interactions and small
244960	250560	structures inside of every galaxy. Now to produce this, the obviously, as I mentioned before,
250560	256080	required a supercomputer. In this case, it used 16,000 different cores and it's known as the
256080	261520	Hazel Hunt supercomputer located in Germany. And to create all this, it required the scientists
261520	266800	approximately a year of continuous calculations. According to them, if I were to use my computer
266800	272560	to do this, it would take me approximately 15,000 years. But because of these simulations and the
272560	277840	actual representation of the universe, this allowed them to discover several major phenomena
277840	282960	that essentially involved a lot of the interaction between various types of particles in this model
282960	287280	universe. For example, one of the major discoveries, as you can kind of see in this simulation,
287280	293440	is a surprisingly common formation of various disk-shaped galaxies. They seem to be way more
293440	299040	common than we originally anticipated. With many of these galaxies also containing things like spiral
299040	304960	arms, things like bulges, and even various galactic bars extending across the galaxy.
304960	309360	More importantly, some of the more unknown discoveries were actually in regards to the
309360	314800	interaction between supernova explosions and the activity from supermassive black holes.
314800	320400	Here it was all in regards to various types of outflow of gas that created a kind of feedback
320400	325760	loop with the gas being kicked out of the galaxy through supernova and supermassive black holes
325760	331520	just to then return back into the galaxy to feed the black hole and create more supernova once again.
331520	337040	Normally, this is how we believe a lot of galaxies form today and how they evolve over time.
337040	342000	And interestingly enough, a lot of these phenomena discovered were absolutely not programmed into
342000	347120	the simulation. They sort of just happened naturally. And that's because of the complexity
347120	352080	of the simulation itself, because of the number of particles, and also because of the time it
352080	358560	represented in this simulation of the universe. But now the Japanese scientists took it a step
358560	364800	further. Okay, like a really big step further. Introducing the Japanese project they refer
364800	371920	to as Uju, which is Japanese for outer space. And this project is, well, it's basically illustrious,
371920	378640	but like on steroids, it's illustrious times 100. And I'm not exaggerating this. It literally
378640	384480	involves two trillion different particles. And it also represents a universe that's around
384480	390800	9.6 billion light years across. It's bigger, it's more complex, and it's way, way more advanced
390800	395520	than illustrious was ever able to produce. Now, let me just show you the part of the simulation
395520	400480	that was released by the scientists that you can also find in the link in the description below.
400480	404960	And so what you're looking at right here is basically the interaction between a lot of these
404960	412160	particles and the creation of the, once again, universe in the box. But this time a tremendously
412160	418240	massive universe, a universe that is almost exactly the same size as the actual observable
418240	424480	universe, just a little bit smaller. And honestly, this is absolutely mind blowing. So we don't
424480	429120	really know what's going to be discovered here just yet, mostly because the whole point of this
429120	434400	was just to create a simulation. But chances are a lot of incredible discoveries are going to be made
434400	439760	once the data from this is analyzed. And once the scientists start to look deep into what actually
439760	445280	was created by a lot of these particles interacting. And interestingly, even the scientists themselves
445280	450240	refer to this as a kind of a time machine. Here you can go forward, you can go backward,
450240	455360	you can stop time, you can zoom in, you can choose a single galaxy, you can choose a single
455360	460960	galactic cluster, and you can basically do anything you want with it and investigate anything you want
460960	466800	just to discover various properties created in this unusual and somewhat realistic universe.
466800	471680	And what makes this, I guess, to some extent more exciting, especially for amateur scientists or
471680	477760	amateur astronomers, is that all this is freely available to download. But it's not just like a
477760	482720	simulation, you can download like Space Engine. It does require a little bit of knowledge in terms
482720	487600	of data retrieval, and also a little bit of knowledge in terms of data processing as well.
487600	492720	And so for example, in order to access something like this, and to be able to see what the scientists
492720	497840	saw in their simulation, you would first have to access the data through this publicly available
497840	503680	dataset right here. With I guess the easiest way to do this, being the GitHub page right here,
503680	508560	which has a collection of different Python tools and Jupyter notebooks that have several
508560	513040	examples and several commands that you can use, especially if you have knowledge of Python,
513040	517600	with the basics on how to install this and how to use this available in there as well.
517600	523520	But because this data represents approximately 100 terabytes of data, it would be very, very
523520	528640	difficult to download all of this and to try to recreate this on your own computer. And so to
528640	533280	try to recreate something like this, it would require a little bit of data processing and the
533280	538720	ability to create visualizations using the available data. And so there are no actual videos
538720	544240	available just yet. But ultimately, one day, hopefully someone is going to be able to produce
544240	549440	something similar to Space Engine by using the data collected from these various studies,
549440	555200	allowing us to go into any time frame, and allowing us to zoom in on any of these objects,
555200	559440	in order to see some of these most incredible and most detailed representations
559440	564320	of different objects in the universe. So in this particular case, the simulation was able to create
564320	569920	something that was only a few light years across. Many of us in theory should be able to see various
569920	575200	star systems and possibly even certain planets. But to be honest, to create something like this
575200	580960	as an actual simulation similar to Space Engine might never really be possible, simply because of
580960	586880	the complexity of things involved here. Now it'll be great if someone did it, but chances are it
586880	592080	will never happen. Mostly because the actual commercial technology is just not there yet.
592080	596240	We might be able to have a lot of visualizations and a lot of videos similar to this one,
596240	601280	but we're not probably going to have a Space Engine-like exploration tool for quite a while.
601280	606000	Now hopefully someone proves me wrong, but chances are we're going to be limited to just looking at
606000	611040	the data or looking at videos. Either way though, it's still quite impressive at what the sciences
611040	617440	were able to achieve using the computer you see right here, known as Atterui II, the most powerful
617440	622720	supercomputer when it comes to astronomical simulations. Now one intriguing feature coming
622720	628400	out of this simulation is the fact that they mostly focused on the idea of dark matter. And so in
628400	634240	this simulation, the mysterious halos of dark matter more or less control what you see forming.
634240	639920	And notice how the actual formation does seem to resemble the actual universe we observe in real
639920	646240	life as well. Which of course implies that, well maybe, dark mirror halos exist after all. At the
646240	651680	same time, the purpose of the simulation is to actually try to see the future as well, or essentially
651680	656960	try to see the eventual fate of the universe. Now it's obviously not entirely clear what exactly
656960	660880	is going to happen to the universe from this simulation, and the scientists have not really
660880	666000	mentioned anything just yet. But I'm sure a lot of future studies investigating the last moments
666000	671920	of the simulation might be able to show us what's going to happen to a lot of galactic clusters,
671920	677120	a lot of different large formations, including of course galaxies, and a lot of other mysterious
677120	683120	formations such as the extremely massive cosmic web. And in case you were wondering, the supercomputer
683120	689040	contained over 40,000 different computer cores and also took over a year to generate approximately
689040	695440	three petabytes of data that would then convert to 100 terabytes of data that can be easily analyzed
695440	701040	using Python. And so it's sort of mind blowing to know that hypothetically you could download the
701040	707040	entire universe, and it's only about 100 terabytes in size. And since this is approximately 100 times
707040	711760	more advanced than the previously mentioned illustrious project, I can only imagine what we're going
711760	718240	to achieve in the next five or even 10 years. For all we know, we might be able to create a universe
718240	723440	that physically contains actual planets and moons, and potentially even has a lot of other
723440	727600	interactions on the surface as well. Now this is obviously something we might be able to create
727600	731920	in the future, and in theory nothing is really stopping us from getting there. But for now,
731920	738400	in 2021, this right here is the best we have. A universe that's about nine billion light years
738400	744560	across, and that represents approximately 13 billion years of evolution. It contains approximately
744560	750000	two trillion particles, with each of the particles representing something different, possibly a part
750000	755040	of the star, possibly some sort of a gas, or maybe a black hole. And so definitely a really
755040	758640	impressive achievement. By the way, you can learn more about all of this from the paper in the
758640	763600	description below. And so I guess for now, that's sort of all I wanted to mention. Although maybe
763600	769600	there's one more thing. The idea of a universe as a simulation, and I'm sure someone in the
769600	774720	comments is going to mention this, does this actually prove that maybe we live in an actual
774720	780960	supercomputer simulation created by something else? Well, to some extent, there's really no way to
780960	786560	prove this. And to other extent, what we're creating with these simulations, like the space
786560	792000	engine, or the one I just showed you, the one known as Uchu, it doesn't necessarily represent
792000	797760	everything we know about the universe. For example, it does not at all simulate the idea of particle
797760	804880	physics. It also completely ignores the idea of quantum physics. This mostly shows us the interaction
804880	810240	between various particles influencing each other gravitationally. And so because of this,
810240	816800	it still is extremely simple compared to what we actually have as a reality and where we live.
816800	823280	And trying to simulate this would be almost impossible. Just the fact that we have to simulate
823280	829040	quantum physics and the idea of particles being in different places at different times, that would
829040	834400	be almost impossible. That's something we cannot achieve even using some of the most complex
834400	840160	computers on the planet right now. And so since there is no actual way to prove or disprove this,
840400	845360	I'm just going to leave this as a kind of a philosophical question. But in my opinion,
845920	850080	it's very likely that we do not live in a simulation. And there are actually some really
850080	854800	strong arguments against that. And we'll talk about some of these in some of the future videos.
854800	858480	But anyway, until then, check out relevant links in the description below, subscribe if
