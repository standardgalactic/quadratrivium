0	4000	Hello wonderful person this is Anton and today we're going to be discussing one of the bigger
4000	10160	mysteries of cosmology that you can sort of see circled right here. This is referred to as the
10160	16560	cold spot. The unusually large and relatively cold area inside the so-called cosmic microwave
16560	22480	background that for the longest time now did not have a definitive explanation. And in this video
22480	26960	we're going to be talking about one of the potential and most likely resolutions to this mystery
26960	31680	or basically what exactly formed this particular spot and just generally talk about some of the
31680	37440	most unusual and most mysterious structures in the universe usually referred to as supervoids.
37440	42480	But I actually wanted to start right here with this image of what's known as the Buddhist void.
42480	47680	Mostly because back in the days this was one of the most requested videos that I never specifically
47680	52880	made on this topic for the reason I'm about to explain. And a lot of people were basically wondering
52880	58320	so what exactly is the Buddhist void, what is this mysterious great nothing that it's usually
58320	65120	referred to as and what is forming these unusually large but empty structures. And one of the reasons
65120	70320	I never specifically made a video about Buddhist void is because well it's just one of many many
70320	76560	voids. And as a matter of fact it's not the largest or the closest to us. The closest one is known as
76560	81200	the local void and there is a video about this somewhere up there. But how exactly do these
81200	85840	structures form and what actually happens inside of them. And I guess the other question is where
85840	90960	are some of the larger ones. Well in general their formation is directly connected to the
90960	96400	formation of the cosmic web that essentially sort of spreads across the entire universe and usually
96400	101920	has the galaxies connecting to one another. In essence the cosmic web itself sort of looks like
101920	106000	this and everything you see in the middle those are different galaxies and a lot of different
106000	111760	types of gas. But naturally in between the cosmic web and in between all of these galaxies and all
111760	117920	of this gas there are these voids or slightly emptier space that doesn't contain as much density,
117920	122480	doesn't contain as many galaxies and doesn't generally contain much of anything. There is
122480	127280	still some stuff there, there are even some galaxies there, just not as many as inside the
127280	132240	web itself. And a lot of these simulations made over the last few years using very super computers
132240	136800	like this one right here known as the illustrious project have generally been able to recreate
136800	142720	this cosmic web. Showing the scientists exactly how all of this forms but more importantly also
142720	147680	recreating a lot of these structures such as voids and supervoids just as we see them in the
147680	153680	real universe as well. And so in essence some of these empty spaces right here these are the voids
153680	158480	you see in this three-dimensional map of the nearby space. Oh and by the way just to give you
158480	164400	perspective here these are actually huge distances. Here it's about 700 million light-years away from
164400	168800	us and our galaxy is not even visible in this picture it's just a tiny tiny blob somewhere
168800	174000	right there. But why exactly are we talking about this? Well as you probably guessed by now the recent
174000	179520	study quite thoroughly investigates and more or less definitively proves that this cold spot right
179520	185840	here sort of represents one of the biggest voids out there that in essence answers a lot of questions
185920	191440	including the question I asked previously about the biggest supervoid out there and also the question
191440	196480	in regards to why exactly this particular cold spot even exists. Although okay let's actually
196480	202240	take a few steps back and briefly talk about the CMB. So naturally what you're looking at right here
202240	207840	is the left over radiation or the so-called relic radiation from the early universe. This is the
207840	213840	first light in the universe as it traveled across the universe for practically 13.8 billion years.
213840	219920	This light was originally created when the universe was just under 380 000 years old
219920	225120	and basically represents the first electromagnetic radiation that was created in the universe itself.
225120	230560	And by traveling for 13.8 billion years it eventually sort of redshifted into the current
230560	236240	frequencies and even though originally it was about 3000 Kelvin in temperature now it's down to
236240	242880	approximately 2.7 Kelvin so almost absolute zero temperatures. And so in essence this is the light
242880	248800	that's only visible in the microwave spectrum of radiation in the gigahertz frequencies just
248800	253920	above the radio waves. But as you can see from the map there is quite a lot of variation with
253920	258240	certain parts being specifically interesting because they seem to be a little bit cooler.
258240	263440	But the actual temperature difference here is very minute. It's about 7 micro Kelvin or about
263440	270560	0.00007 degrees Kelvin. But it is nevertheless a representation of some sort of a difference
270560	274720	or some sort of a structural formation that created this particular cold spot.
274720	279280	And here's actually what all this would look like in a nice case if you were to somehow see
279280	284080	all of this radiation. And since the original discovery of this cold spot a few years ago
284080	288800	there's been quite a lot of discussion about its potential origins. One of the more unusual
288800	294720	sort of explanations in this case involved multiple universes. In this case at least one scientist
294720	299920	made a somewhat controversial claim that it could maybe some sort of an imprint from another
299920	305760	universe that seems to be beyond our own. Something that happened before the cosmic inflation
305760	311360	early on in the creation or the formation of the universe. Now because it's somewhat difficult to
311360	317360	prove this and because the ideas here are basically extremely hypothetical it's practically impossible
317360	321920	to prove or disprove this. So a better way to actually analyze this is to see if we can come
321920	326240	up with a better explanation. If you are interested in this proposition though you can check out more
326240	331760	about this in the wiki in the description below. And so the much better and more widely accepted
331760	336800	explanation in the last few years was actually in regards to the previously mentioned voids.
336800	341520	In this particular case it's always been suggested that there was some kind of a supervoid here.
341520	346080	So large that it would make it probably the largest void we've discovered so far.
346080	351520	It's been always referred to as the Eridanus supervoid. And there are several physical theories
351520	356720	explaining how such a void would actually potentially create a cold spot inside the
356720	361440	microwave background radiation. And so this new study decided to see if they can prove the
361440	367200	existence of this void by using the data from the so-called dark energy survey. And specifically
367200	372160	they actually wanted to see if the observations from the Planck telescope that created the
372160	377760	microwave background map could be then matched with some of the other maps for example produced by
377760	382560	the dark energy survey. And this survey doesn't actually use microwave background radiation,
382560	387600	it uses entirely different observations. In this case it looks at various near ultraviolet
387600	392400	visible and near infrared observations and measures the expansion of the universe using
392400	397600	type 1 supernova, various large galactic clusters and various other effects including
397600	403440	gravitational winding effects produced by various events. And by using this survey in the past the
403440	408160	scientists have actually been able to create not just the map of the dark energy distribution
408160	413360	but also the map of dark matter which basically acts in the opposite way. And so some of the most
413360	418080	accurate dark matter maps we have so far have actually been produced by this particular survey.
418080	423920	Here's for example one of the most recent maps produced by the survey from 2021. And so by comparing
423920	430000	the maps from DES to the maps from CMB the scientists realized that they too seem to match.
430000	434320	In the process discovering that this particular region seems to have a lot less galaxies
434320	440160	than a lot of other regions nearby. Naturally also containing a lot less dark matter as well.
440160	446480	Fitting the definition of what you would call a void or in this case a super void. And according to
446480	451840	the scientists in this paper this would be a gigantic structure, empty structure. It would be
451840	458160	approximately 1.8 billion light years across and would be located approximately 2 billion light years
458160	463520	away from us. Which also means that it's probably the nearest such super void to us. Or as it's
463520	469280	referred to in the paper the nearest under density to earth. With the average density inside the void
469280	476080	being approximately 30% less than the density of mass and galaxies and so on around it. And so once
476080	480880	again it's not that it's empty space it's actually not empty at all. It just there's a lot less
480880	486320	stuff on the inside. Which is why it creates this cold spot visible right here. But at the same time
486320	492320	it also seems to be cigar shaped or sausage shaped and we're basically looking at it from I guess
492320	497360	this perspective right here. So we're sort of facing the tunnel in this case. And although this
497360	502880	does sort of explain everything once and for all it doesn't explain one thing. It doesn't explain
502880	508160	the origins or how such a huge structure was created. And mostly because at the moment all
508160	514160	of the models do not produce any such extremely large structures. It kind of suggests that either
514160	519280	there is something wrong with our current physical model of the universe. Or for some reason the
519280	525120	universe decided to produce this unusually anomalous object that's somewhat difficult to explain using
525120	530080	modern physics. Either way whatever the explanation is going to be in the next few years the paper
530080	535680	itself is very interesting. And the finding in this case almost definitively proves that a redanus
535680	540880	super void is basically the largest such formation close to us. And it's probably one of the biggest
540880	546080	super voids in the universe. And actually most likely even closer to us as well. It's also not
546080	550640	in this map right now mostly because this is a little bit outdated. But for now we don't really
550640	555440	know what's happening inside the void and how it was formed. Maybe there was more dark energy present
555440	560560	in this region and so the universe expanded a little bit faster. Or maybe there are some other
560560	565360	unexplained phenomena happening inside the void that's causing these effects. Either way though
565360	569360	it's definitely going to be really interesting to find out what the explanation for this is
569360	573280	in some of the future studies. For example one of the suggestions in the paper is that
573280	576960	maybe there's actually something going on with the slightly weaker gravitational
576960	581920	landing effect that's already been detected in the paper. Whatever it is the future will tell.
581920	586800	For now it's definitely a great confirmation and a great explanation to an old mystery.
