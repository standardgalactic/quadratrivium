0	4040	Hello and for person, this is Anton and today we are going to discuss something slightly
4040	6880	different or I guess maybe not so different.
6880	12540	In a sense that we are going to be discussing the idea behind the evolution of life but here
12540	17720	based on a somewhat intriguing study by the researchers from Google and specifically a
17720	23360	study that tries to mimic the evolution of life by using an extremely simple computer
23360	28880	code and in a process they actually do make some somewhat unexpected discoveries.
28880	33200	All of which you can discover yourself by reading the study in the description below.
33200	37520	And so let's actually discuss this in a little bit more detail and talk about why this is
37520	43880	maybe kind of important but also what it shows us in regards to the concept known as self-replication.
43880	46160	But first I guess just a brief history.
46160	51160	So this idea of trying to simulate a life like environment by using mathematical principles
51160	54800	and computer simulations is obviously not new.
54800	60160	The famous Conway's game of life is probably the best known example where a kind of an automated
60160	65200	system can actually be devised mathematically by introducing just a few simple rules and
65200	67520	by then seeing how the system evolves.
67520	70920	You can actually try the examples of this in one of the links in the description but
70920	75200	in essence this is known to produce quite a few interesting patterns with some of these
75200	79360	patterns possessing somewhat interesting behavior such as motion.
79360	84200	But the main ideas behind all of this essentially start with a kind of a mathematical slash
84200	89880	philosophical exploration back in the 1940s and 1950s with essentially one of the main
89880	95320	I guess fathers of this concept being a famous engineer, mathematician and physicist John
95320	96440	von Neumann.
96440	99680	And you might know his name because he was also responsible for the concept known as
99680	105480	the von Neumann probes or basically self-replicating probes that could technically exist somewhere
105480	110760	out there and represent a kind of an end game for various alien civilizations that could
110760	113240	help them colonize the rest of the universe.
113240	117920	And so he was actually super fascinated with the idea of self-replication with his research
117920	122440	basically inspiring a lot of other mathematicians and a lot of other scientists to try to look
122440	124040	into this a little bit further.
124040	129200	Ironically though he was able to propose all of this before we even knew DNA existed
129200	134440	and so in some sense his research became fundamental in order to help us understand how various
134440	139840	biological units are able to reproduce and are also able to evolve over time.
139920	144920	And so in some sense this new study by Google is kind of a continuation of all of this work
144920	150160	after several decades but in this case discovers something that we've never really seen before
150160	153040	which is why I thought it was kind of worth exploring.
153040	157520	So for example in that game of life I showed you previously one thing that it does not
157520	163280	do is basically create its own copies or evolve in a way where it mimics life itself.
163280	166320	And that's despite being really complex otherwise.
166320	170560	But in this new study the scientists took a slightly different approach.
170560	173840	First of all they chose an extremely simple language.
173840	175720	Okay this is going to be hard.
175720	180440	The name of the language is right here on the screen and it's essentially a somewhat
180440	186360	simple but somewhat eccentric language created by a computer science student back in 1993
186360	191360	that contains only eight simple commands but is fully functional otherwise.
191360	195200	And though it's not really meant for practical use mostly because all of the programs end
195200	200480	up being super long it is nevertheless quite functional and obviously can be used to write
200480	201520	programs.
201520	205440	And Wikipedia article below does actually provide some examples such as the famous
205440	209760	Hello World program that in this case takes quite a few lines of code.
209760	215040	And so because this language is so minimalistic it's actually surprisingly useful for all
215040	217520	kinds of evolutionary research.
217520	222520	Here because there are only eight instructions everything becomes extremely simple and extremely
222520	224080	easy to implement.
224080	228600	And so for this particular study the researchers basically did something super simple.
228600	234160	They created a kind of a digital primordial soup and to some extent you can see it visualized
234160	235280	right here.
235280	239000	And what you're looking at right here are a bunch of random programs that don't really
239000	243360	have anything in them other than a few really simple instructions.
243360	247120	But for the most part there is no general instruction, there is no rule, there is no
247120	250200	regulation all of this is just completely random.
250200	253320	So in some sense it directly mimics the game of life.
253320	257120	But most importantly there is absolutely no pressure to do anything.
257120	261720	All of these individual programs and there are millions of them here are left to do whatever
261720	262720	they want to do.
262720	263720	And this is really important.
263720	269720	There is absolutely no rule or any kind of regulation to evolve or to self-replicate.
269720	274960	And so now all of these individual pieces of code start to interact randomly combining
274960	280880	and mixing together and also executing additional instructions as they slowly change because
280880	282480	of random interactions.
282480	285880	And in this case this is done for millions of generations.
285880	290600	And the assumption here based on the idea that there is really no instruction, no regulation,
290600	295000	no particular direction or force or pressure was that basically all of this is just going
295000	300440	to randomly change over time possibly shift here and there but most likely not really
300440	302720	affect anything too dramatically.
302720	306680	So for example unlike previous simulations these programs don't even have to do anything
306680	310960	because there is no point system and they don't actually win or lose anything.
310960	315240	So the expectation being that because the population was capped at a fixed number they
315240	319640	are going to do a bunch of random stuff but do nothing that's comprehensible or that
319640	321160	has any direction.
321160	323320	And this is where the surprise starts.
323320	328720	In every single case they did something that was directional and they did evolve into something
328720	329800	unexpected.
329800	333640	And you can actually see this visualized in the bottom left corner and it's going to
333640	335720	start happening really soon.
335720	341480	In every single simulation some of these programs eventually emerged as self-replicating taking
341480	343720	over the rest of the simulation.
343720	348520	And this emergence of self-replication seems to have happened multiple times and in many
348520	353800	cases some of these self-replicators were much better than others and thus started to basically
353800	358880	kind of compete for space even though this was never programmed or never intended.
358880	363960	So in this case you can see that one of these first replicators is now taking over everything.
363960	368520	But eventually after a few more generations more and more competition started to appear
368520	372960	and in some cases would completely overwhelm all of the other programs.
372960	377920	Which is really bizarre because this mimics a biological system without any programming
377920	380480	or any code to tell it to do so.
380480	385320	And because there was no explicit fitness function yet fitness still emerged and some programs
385320	389320	were basically better than others this was a relatively big shock.
389320	393240	And you can see all of this in a couple of YouTube videos I posted in the description
393240	398560	where it helps you visualize these programs after millions and millions of evolutionary processes.
398560	403480	And in many of these experiments it sometimes took up to millions of steps before this unusual
403480	405440	behavior started to appear.
405440	409720	But interestingly enough some of these programs were basically just run on a laptop and after
409720	413840	about half an hour in every single case you would see self-replication.
413840	415720	And this is of course really interesting.
415720	420400	Even though we understand evolution to a pretty good extent we still have no idea how various
420400	424080	molecules early on eventually became self-replicating.
424080	428120	And even though this experiment doesn't really tell us exactly what happened what it does
428120	433200	kind of show us is essentially some kind of an inherent mechanism that possibly creates
433200	436080	complexity from absolutely nothing.
436080	440440	Or basically the implication here is that complex biological behavior can spontaneously
440440	442880	appear if you wait long enough.
442880	446920	And so as the researchers say themselves nothing magical happened here and absolutely
446920	451400	no direction was given to anything other than a few initial instructions.
451400	455760	And so if they were able to create this after just half an hour on a laptop we can only
455760	460280	imagine what could happen on a typical planet with a lot more complexity and a lot more
460280	463360	chemical diversity after billions of years.
463360	466440	Or I guess that's the basic conclusion from this study.
466440	470520	Because of the limitations of the computer power here obviously nothing more complex
470520	475000	arose from this and obviously none of these programs developed into some kind of a super
475000	479340	complex intelligence or even when beyond simple self-replication.
479340	484360	And that's actually one of the biggest criticisms from various biological sciences so far.
484360	488920	Here they don't actually think this would lead to more complex behavior automatically.
488920	493360	Or in other words even though self-replication is very impressive they don't think other
493360	495600	things would follow afterwards.
495600	499840	And they do actually provide several examples where this might have occurred using other
499840	502800	experiments even using things like RNA.
502800	508160	There are several experiments that used various RNA molecules where various RNA strands were
508160	513680	replicated in a test tube which resulted in RNA getting shorter and shorter and replication
513680	515600	getting faster and faster.
515600	519600	And in those experiments even though I guess replication was achieved it was not rewarding
519600	525160	complexity instead it was rewarding simplicity and the speed of self-replication.
525160	529440	And biologists believe that this is maybe the opposite of what's needed to explain the
529440	532280	complexity of biological life on Earth.
532280	536660	And so basically they don't think that having a bunch of self-replicators is going to guarantee
536660	538160	further complexity.
538160	542560	Mostly because here it's the simplicity and the speed that seems to guide everything.
542560	548400	On top of this because life actually involves DNA, RNA, proteins and a huge interplay of
548400	554480	various complex systems just looking at self-replication is not really helping us enough to understand
554480	556200	how all of this could evolve.
556200	561160	Nevertheless in this study there is maybe some evidence that this is the beginning of
561160	566040	something more complex it just it would need more time and possibly more computational
566040	567040	power.
567040	570880	On top of this the scientists actually tried this using other languages or other simple
570880	575880	languages such as FORTH, Z80 and the language known as SUBLIQ.
575880	581080	And interestingly only SUBLIQ was actually unable to produce self-replicators.
581080	585680	And here they believe it's because it required a much longer length of code with the longer
585680	591200	code no longer being able to produce replication instead of producing random programs.
591200	595840	With the main conclusion here being that the length plays a very important role in determining
595840	599040	if self-replication is going to become possible.
599040	603920	But naturally except for this simple replication there are still so many unanswered questions
603920	606000	and so many things that we still don't know.
606000	610840	For example how much additional complexity can be produced given enough time.
610840	616080	Also what exactly causes the self-replication to appear and is there any way for us to guide
616080	619880	the evolution of these systems to produce even more complexity.
619880	625360	Lastly is the evolution produced here similar to what we observe in real world or are there
625360	630280	any specific notable differences that we can want to explore in future studies.
630280	634720	And so basically at least for now the only thing we know for sure is that self-replication
634720	636440	seems to appear naturally.
636440	639480	But everything else is still kind of undetermined.
639480	644160	Although because this is a fundamental property of life technically this is a super important
644160	645160	discovery.
645160	649520	And one thing that kind of connects to all of this is once again research by von Neumann
649520	654080	and his colleague from the Los Alamos laboratory, Stanislav Ulam.
654080	659560	In the early 1940s way before the discovery of DNA and way before computers became relatively
659560	665320	widespread the first research on self-replication was actually done with clay crystals.
665320	671000	And that's because surprisingly except for DNA and RNA crystals produced inside clay
671000	674880	exhibit the only other known form of self-replication.
674880	679640	And that's because clay is made out of large number of small crystals inside the environment
679640	681560	that promotes crystal growth.
681560	686240	But it also promotes the growth of various irregularities especially when placed in water
686240	687240	solution.
687240	691640	And so as these crystals grow and develop they actually end up producing irregularities
691640	697200	that then break apart forming new crystals, new irregularities and even undergoing a kind
697200	699120	of evolutionary change.
699120	703800	Which actually surprisingly corresponds to all of the definitions of self-replication
703800	706960	and mimics the biological life extremely well.
706960	709360	Which of course raises a lot of questions.
709360	713600	For example does that actually mean that some kind of a crystalline life could exist somewhere
713600	717600	out there produced by clay on some other planet somewhere out there?
717600	722520	Or maybe this is actually how life on Earth formed as well starting from these simple
722520	727720	clays early on with these crystals eventually replaced by various organic molecules.
727720	731240	All of these questions have actually been tackled by various papers but we just don't
731240	732760	have any answers yet.
732760	737120	Nevertheless because of this new study hopefully this will lead to more interest, additional
737120	740840	simulations and possibly additional exciting discoveries.
740840	745120	But until those future studies or until other discoveries that's pretty much it.
