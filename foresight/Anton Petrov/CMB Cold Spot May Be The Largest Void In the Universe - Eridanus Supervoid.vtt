Hello wonderful person this is Anton and today we're going to be discussing one of the bigger

00:04.000 --> 00:10.160
mysteries of cosmology that you can sort of see circled right here. This is referred to as the

00:10.160 --> 00:16.560
cold spot. The unusually large and relatively cold area inside the so-called cosmic microwave

00:16.560 --> 00:22.480
background that for the longest time now did not have a definitive explanation. And in this video

00:22.480 --> 00:26.960
we're going to be talking about one of the potential and most likely resolutions to this mystery

00:26.960 --> 00:31.680
or basically what exactly formed this particular spot and just generally talk about some of the

00:31.680 --> 00:37.440
most unusual and most mysterious structures in the universe usually referred to as supervoids.

00:37.440 --> 00:42.480
But I actually wanted to start right here with this image of what's known as the Buddhist void.

00:42.480 --> 00:47.680
Mostly because back in the days this was one of the most requested videos that I never specifically

00:47.680 --> 00:52.880
made on this topic for the reason I'm about to explain. And a lot of people were basically wondering

00:52.880 --> 00:58.320
so what exactly is the Buddhist void, what is this mysterious great nothing that it's usually

00:58.320 --> 01:05.120
referred to as and what is forming these unusually large but empty structures. And one of the reasons

01:05.120 --> 01:10.320
I never specifically made a video about Buddhist void is because well it's just one of many many

01:10.320 --> 01:16.560
voids. And as a matter of fact it's not the largest or the closest to us. The closest one is known as

01:16.560 --> 01:21.200
the local void and there is a video about this somewhere up there. But how exactly do these

01:21.200 --> 01:25.840
structures form and what actually happens inside of them. And I guess the other question is where

01:25.840 --> 01:30.960
are some of the larger ones. Well in general their formation is directly connected to the

01:30.960 --> 01:36.400
formation of the cosmic web that essentially sort of spreads across the entire universe and usually

01:36.400 --> 01:41.920
has the galaxies connecting to one another. In essence the cosmic web itself sort of looks like

01:41.920 --> 01:46.000
this and everything you see in the middle those are different galaxies and a lot of different

01:46.000 --> 01:51.760
types of gas. But naturally in between the cosmic web and in between all of these galaxies and all

01:51.760 --> 01:57.920
of this gas there are these voids or slightly emptier space that doesn't contain as much density,

01:57.920 --> 02:02.480
doesn't contain as many galaxies and doesn't generally contain much of anything. There is

02:02.480 --> 02:07.280
still some stuff there, there are even some galaxies there, just not as many as inside the

02:07.280 --> 02:12.240
web itself. And a lot of these simulations made over the last few years using very super computers

02:12.240 --> 02:16.800
like this one right here known as the illustrious project have generally been able to recreate

02:16.800 --> 02:22.720
this cosmic web. Showing the scientists exactly how all of this forms but more importantly also

02:22.720 --> 02:27.680
recreating a lot of these structures such as voids and supervoids just as we see them in the

02:27.680 --> 02:33.680
real universe as well. And so in essence some of these empty spaces right here these are the voids

02:33.680 --> 02:38.480
you see in this three-dimensional map of the nearby space. Oh and by the way just to give you

02:38.480 --> 02:44.400
perspective here these are actually huge distances. Here it's about 700 million light-years away from

02:44.400 --> 02:48.800
us and our galaxy is not even visible in this picture it's just a tiny tiny blob somewhere

02:48.800 --> 02:54.000
right there. But why exactly are we talking about this? Well as you probably guessed by now the recent

02:54.000 --> 02:59.520
study quite thoroughly investigates and more or less definitively proves that this cold spot right

02:59.520 --> 03:05.840
here sort of represents one of the biggest voids out there that in essence answers a lot of questions

03:05.920 --> 03:11.440
including the question I asked previously about the biggest supervoid out there and also the question

03:11.440 --> 03:16.480
in regards to why exactly this particular cold spot even exists. Although okay let's actually

03:16.480 --> 03:22.240
take a few steps back and briefly talk about the CMB. So naturally what you're looking at right here

03:22.240 --> 03:27.840
is the left over radiation or the so-called relic radiation from the early universe. This is the

03:27.840 --> 03:33.840
first light in the universe as it traveled across the universe for practically 13.8 billion years.

03:33.840 --> 03:39.920
This light was originally created when the universe was just under 380 000 years old

03:39.920 --> 03:45.120
and basically represents the first electromagnetic radiation that was created in the universe itself.

03:45.120 --> 03:50.560
And by traveling for 13.8 billion years it eventually sort of redshifted into the current

03:50.560 --> 03:56.240
frequencies and even though originally it was about 3000 Kelvin in temperature now it's down to

03:56.240 --> 04:02.880
approximately 2.7 Kelvin so almost absolute zero temperatures. And so in essence this is the light

04:02.880 --> 04:08.800
that's only visible in the microwave spectrum of radiation in the gigahertz frequencies just

04:08.800 --> 04:13.920
above the radio waves. But as you can see from the map there is quite a lot of variation with

04:13.920 --> 04:18.240
certain parts being specifically interesting because they seem to be a little bit cooler.

04:18.240 --> 04:23.440
But the actual temperature difference here is very minute. It's about 7 micro Kelvin or about

04:23.440 --> 04:30.560
0.00007 degrees Kelvin. But it is nevertheless a representation of some sort of a difference

04:30.560 --> 04:34.720
or some sort of a structural formation that created this particular cold spot.

04:34.720 --> 04:39.280
And here's actually what all this would look like in a nice case if you were to somehow see

04:39.280 --> 04:44.080
all of this radiation. And since the original discovery of this cold spot a few years ago

04:44.080 --> 04:48.800
there's been quite a lot of discussion about its potential origins. One of the more unusual

04:48.800 --> 04:54.720
sort of explanations in this case involved multiple universes. In this case at least one scientist

04:54.720 --> 04:59.920
made a somewhat controversial claim that it could maybe some sort of an imprint from another

04:59.920 --> 05:05.760
universe that seems to be beyond our own. Something that happened before the cosmic inflation

05:05.760 --> 05:11.360
early on in the creation or the formation of the universe. Now because it's somewhat difficult to

05:11.360 --> 05:17.360
prove this and because the ideas here are basically extremely hypothetical it's practically impossible

05:17.360 --> 05:21.920
to prove or disprove this. So a better way to actually analyze this is to see if we can come

05:21.920 --> 05:26.240
up with a better explanation. If you are interested in this proposition though you can check out more

05:26.240 --> 05:31.760
about this in the wiki in the description below. And so the much better and more widely accepted

05:31.760 --> 05:36.800
explanation in the last few years was actually in regards to the previously mentioned voids.

05:36.800 --> 05:41.520
In this particular case it's always been suggested that there was some kind of a supervoid here.

05:41.520 --> 05:46.080
So large that it would make it probably the largest void we've discovered so far.

05:46.080 --> 05:51.520
It's been always referred to as the Eridanus supervoid. And there are several physical theories

05:51.520 --> 05:56.720
explaining how such a void would actually potentially create a cold spot inside the

05:56.720 --> 06:01.440
microwave background radiation. And so this new study decided to see if they can prove the

06:01.440 --> 06:07.200
existence of this void by using the data from the so-called dark energy survey. And specifically

06:07.200 --> 06:12.160
they actually wanted to see if the observations from the Planck telescope that created the

06:12.160 --> 06:17.760
microwave background map could be then matched with some of the other maps for example produced by

06:17.760 --> 06:22.560
the dark energy survey. And this survey doesn't actually use microwave background radiation,

06:22.560 --> 06:27.600
it uses entirely different observations. In this case it looks at various near ultraviolet

06:27.600 --> 06:32.400
visible and near infrared observations and measures the expansion of the universe using

06:32.400 --> 06:37.600
type 1 supernova, various large galactic clusters and various other effects including

06:37.600 --> 06:43.440
gravitational winding effects produced by various events. And by using this survey in the past the

06:43.440 --> 06:48.160
scientists have actually been able to create not just the map of the dark energy distribution

06:48.160 --> 06:53.360
but also the map of dark matter which basically acts in the opposite way. And so some of the most

06:53.360 --> 06:58.080
accurate dark matter maps we have so far have actually been produced by this particular survey.

06:58.080 --> 07:03.920
Here's for example one of the most recent maps produced by the survey from 2021. And so by comparing

07:03.920 --> 07:10.000
the maps from DES to the maps from CMB the scientists realized that they too seem to match.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.320
In the process discovering that this particular region seems to have a lot less galaxies

07:14.320 --> 07:20.160
than a lot of other regions nearby. Naturally also containing a lot less dark matter as well.

07:20.160 --> 07:26.480
Fitting the definition of what you would call a void or in this case a super void. And according to

07:26.480 --> 07:31.840
the scientists in this paper this would be a gigantic structure, empty structure. It would be

07:31.840 --> 07:38.160
approximately 1.8 billion light years across and would be located approximately 2 billion light years

07:38.160 --> 07:43.520
away from us. Which also means that it's probably the nearest such super void to us. Or as it's

07:43.520 --> 07:49.280
referred to in the paper the nearest under density to earth. With the average density inside the void

07:49.280 --> 07:56.080
being approximately 30% less than the density of mass and galaxies and so on around it. And so once

07:56.080 --> 08:00.880
again it's not that it's empty space it's actually not empty at all. It just there's a lot less

08:00.880 --> 08:06.320
stuff on the inside. Which is why it creates this cold spot visible right here. But at the same time

08:06.320 --> 08:12.320
it also seems to be cigar shaped or sausage shaped and we're basically looking at it from I guess

08:12.320 --> 08:17.360
this perspective right here. So we're sort of facing the tunnel in this case. And although this

08:17.360 --> 08:22.880
does sort of explain everything once and for all it doesn't explain one thing. It doesn't explain

08:22.880 --> 08:28.160
the origins or how such a huge structure was created. And mostly because at the moment all

08:28.160 --> 08:34.160
of the models do not produce any such extremely large structures. It kind of suggests that either

08:34.160 --> 08:39.280
there is something wrong with our current physical model of the universe. Or for some reason the

08:39.280 --> 08:45.120
universe decided to produce this unusually anomalous object that's somewhat difficult to explain using

08:45.120 --> 08:50.080
modern physics. Either way whatever the explanation is going to be in the next few years the paper

08:50.080 --> 08:55.680
itself is very interesting. And the finding in this case almost definitively proves that a redanus

08:55.680 --> 09:00.880
super void is basically the largest such formation close to us. And it's probably one of the biggest

09:00.880 --> 09:06.080
super voids in the universe. And actually most likely even closer to us as well. It's also not

09:06.080 --> 09:10.640
in this map right now mostly because this is a little bit outdated. But for now we don't really

09:10.640 --> 09:15.440
know what's happening inside the void and how it was formed. Maybe there was more dark energy present

09:15.440 --> 09:20.560
in this region and so the universe expanded a little bit faster. Or maybe there are some other

09:20.560 --> 09:25.360
unexplained phenomena happening inside the void that's causing these effects. Either way though

09:25.360 --> 09:29.360
it's definitely going to be really interesting to find out what the explanation for this is

09:29.360 --> 09:33.280
in some of the future studies. For example one of the suggestions in the paper is that

09:33.280 --> 09:36.960
maybe there's actually something going on with the slightly weaker gravitational

09:36.960 --> 09:41.920
landing effect that's already been detected in the paper. Whatever it is the future will tell.

09:41.920 --> 09:46.800
For now it's definitely a great confirmation and a great explanation to an old mystery.
