00:00.000 --> 00:04.040
Hello and for person, this is Anton and today we are going to discuss something slightly

00:04.040 --> 00:06.880
different or I guess maybe not so different.

00:06.880 --> 00:12.540
In a sense that we are going to be discussing the idea behind the evolution of life but here

00:12.540 --> 00:17.720
based on a somewhat intriguing study by the researchers from Google and specifically a

00:17.720 --> 00:23.360
study that tries to mimic the evolution of life by using an extremely simple computer

00:23.360 --> 00:28.880
code and in a process they actually do make some somewhat unexpected discoveries.

00:28.880 --> 00:33.200
All of which you can discover yourself by reading the study in the description below.

00:33.200 --> 00:37.520
And so let's actually discuss this in a little bit more detail and talk about why this is

00:37.520 --> 00:43.880
maybe kind of important but also what it shows us in regards to the concept known as self-replication.

00:43.880 --> 00:46.160
But first I guess just a brief history.

00:46.160 --> 00:51.160
So this idea of trying to simulate a life like environment by using mathematical principles

00:51.160 --> 00:54.800
and computer simulations is obviously not new.

00:54.800 --> 01:00.160
The famous Conway's game of life is probably the best known example where a kind of an automated

01:00.160 --> 01:05.200
system can actually be devised mathematically by introducing just a few simple rules and

01:05.200 --> 01:07.520
by then seeing how the system evolves.

01:07.520 --> 01:10.920
You can actually try the examples of this in one of the links in the description but

01:10.920 --> 01:15.200
in essence this is known to produce quite a few interesting patterns with some of these

01:15.200 --> 01:19.360
patterns possessing somewhat interesting behavior such as motion.

01:19.360 --> 01:24.200
But the main ideas behind all of this essentially start with a kind of a mathematical slash

01:24.200 --> 01:29.880
philosophical exploration back in the 1940s and 1950s with essentially one of the main

01:29.880 --> 01:35.320
I guess fathers of this concept being a famous engineer, mathematician and physicist John

01:35.320 --> 01:36.440
von Neumann.

01:36.440 --> 01:39.680
And you might know his name because he was also responsible for the concept known as

01:39.680 --> 01:45.480
the von Neumann probes or basically self-replicating probes that could technically exist somewhere

01:45.480 --> 01:50.760
out there and represent a kind of an end game for various alien civilizations that could

01:50.760 --> 01:53.240
help them colonize the rest of the universe.

01:53.240 --> 01:57.920
And so he was actually super fascinated with the idea of self-replication with his research

01:57.920 --> 02:02.440
basically inspiring a lot of other mathematicians and a lot of other scientists to try to look

02:02.440 --> 02:04.040
into this a little bit further.

02:04.040 --> 02:09.200
Ironically though he was able to propose all of this before we even knew DNA existed

02:09.200 --> 02:14.440
and so in some sense his research became fundamental in order to help us understand how various

02:14.440 --> 02:19.840
biological units are able to reproduce and are also able to evolve over time.

02:19.920 --> 02:24.920
And so in some sense this new study by Google is kind of a continuation of all of this work

02:24.920 --> 02:30.160
after several decades but in this case discovers something that we've never really seen before

02:30.160 --> 02:33.040
which is why I thought it was kind of worth exploring.

02:33.040 --> 02:37.520
So for example in that game of life I showed you previously one thing that it does not

02:37.520 --> 02:43.280
do is basically create its own copies or evolve in a way where it mimics life itself.

02:43.280 --> 02:46.320
And that's despite being really complex otherwise.

02:46.320 --> 02:50.560
But in this new study the scientists took a slightly different approach.

02:50.560 --> 02:53.840
First of all they chose an extremely simple language.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.720
Okay this is going to be hard.

02:55.720 --> 03:00.440
The name of the language is right here on the screen and it's essentially a somewhat

03:00.440 --> 03:06.360
simple but somewhat eccentric language created by a computer science student back in 1993

03:06.360 --> 03:11.360
that contains only eight simple commands but is fully functional otherwise.

03:11.360 --> 03:15.200
And though it's not really meant for practical use mostly because all of the programs end

03:15.200 --> 03:20.480
up being super long it is nevertheless quite functional and obviously can be used to write

03:20.480 --> 03:21.520
programs.

03:21.520 --> 03:25.440
And Wikipedia article below does actually provide some examples such as the famous

03:25.440 --> 03:29.760
Hello World program that in this case takes quite a few lines of code.

03:29.760 --> 03:35.040
And so because this language is so minimalistic it's actually surprisingly useful for all

03:35.040 --> 03:37.520
kinds of evolutionary research.

03:37.520 --> 03:42.520
Here because there are only eight instructions everything becomes extremely simple and extremely

03:42.520 --> 03:44.080
easy to implement.

03:44.080 --> 03:48.600
And so for this particular study the researchers basically did something super simple.

03:48.600 --> 03:54.160
They created a kind of a digital primordial soup and to some extent you can see it visualized

03:54.160 --> 03:55.280
right here.

03:55.280 --> 03:59.000
And what you're looking at right here are a bunch of random programs that don't really

03:59.000 --> 04:03.360
have anything in them other than a few really simple instructions.

04:03.360 --> 04:07.120
But for the most part there is no general instruction, there is no rule, there is no

04:07.120 --> 04:10.200
regulation all of this is just completely random.

04:10.200 --> 04:13.320
So in some sense it directly mimics the game of life.

04:13.320 --> 04:17.120
But most importantly there is absolutely no pressure to do anything.

04:17.120 --> 04:21.720
All of these individual programs and there are millions of them here are left to do whatever

04:21.720 --> 04:22.720
they want to do.

04:22.720 --> 04:23.720
And this is really important.

04:23.720 --> 04:29.720
There is absolutely no rule or any kind of regulation to evolve or to self-replicate.

04:29.720 --> 04:34.960
And so now all of these individual pieces of code start to interact randomly combining

04:34.960 --> 04:40.880
and mixing together and also executing additional instructions as they slowly change because

04:40.880 --> 04:42.480
of random interactions.

04:42.480 --> 04:45.880
And in this case this is done for millions of generations.

04:45.880 --> 04:50.600
And the assumption here based on the idea that there is really no instruction, no regulation,

04:50.600 --> 04:55.000
no particular direction or force or pressure was that basically all of this is just going

04:55.000 --> 05:00.440
to randomly change over time possibly shift here and there but most likely not really

05:00.440 --> 05:02.720
affect anything too dramatically.

05:02.720 --> 05:06.680
So for example unlike previous simulations these programs don't even have to do anything

05:06.680 --> 05:10.960
because there is no point system and they don't actually win or lose anything.

05:10.960 --> 05:15.240
So the expectation being that because the population was capped at a fixed number they

05:15.240 --> 05:19.640
are going to do a bunch of random stuff but do nothing that's comprehensible or that

05:19.640 --> 05:21.160
has any direction.

05:21.160 --> 05:23.320
And this is where the surprise starts.

05:23.320 --> 05:28.720
In every single case they did something that was directional and they did evolve into something

05:28.720 --> 05:29.800
unexpected.

05:29.800 --> 05:33.640
And you can actually see this visualized in the bottom left corner and it's going to

05:33.640 --> 05:35.720
start happening really soon.

05:35.720 --> 05:41.480
In every single simulation some of these programs eventually emerged as self-replicating taking

05:41.480 --> 05:43.720
over the rest of the simulation.

05:43.720 --> 05:48.520
And this emergence of self-replication seems to have happened multiple times and in many

05:48.520 --> 05:53.800
cases some of these self-replicators were much better than others and thus started to basically

05:53.800 --> 05:58.880
kind of compete for space even though this was never programmed or never intended.

05:58.880 --> 06:03.960
So in this case you can see that one of these first replicators is now taking over everything.

06:03.960 --> 06:08.520
But eventually after a few more generations more and more competition started to appear

06:08.520 --> 06:12.960
and in some cases would completely overwhelm all of the other programs.

06:12.960 --> 06:17.920
Which is really bizarre because this mimics a biological system without any programming

06:17.920 --> 06:20.480
or any code to tell it to do so.

06:20.480 --> 06:25.320
And because there was no explicit fitness function yet fitness still emerged and some programs

06:25.320 --> 06:29.320
were basically better than others this was a relatively big shock.

06:29.320 --> 06:33.240
And you can see all of this in a couple of YouTube videos I posted in the description

06:33.240 --> 06:38.560
where it helps you visualize these programs after millions and millions of evolutionary processes.

06:38.560 --> 06:43.480
And in many of these experiments it sometimes took up to millions of steps before this unusual

06:43.480 --> 06:45.440
behavior started to appear.

06:45.440 --> 06:49.720
But interestingly enough some of these programs were basically just run on a laptop and after

06:49.720 --> 06:53.840
about half an hour in every single case you would see self-replication.

06:53.840 --> 06:55.720
And this is of course really interesting.

06:55.720 --> 07:00.400
Even though we understand evolution to a pretty good extent we still have no idea how various

07:00.400 --> 07:04.080
molecules early on eventually became self-replicating.

07:04.080 --> 07:08.120
And even though this experiment doesn't really tell us exactly what happened what it does

07:08.120 --> 07:13.200
kind of show us is essentially some kind of an inherent mechanism that possibly creates

07:13.200 --> 07:16.080
complexity from absolutely nothing.

07:16.080 --> 07:20.440
Or basically the implication here is that complex biological behavior can spontaneously

07:20.440 --> 07:22.880
appear if you wait long enough.

07:22.880 --> 07:26.920
And so as the researchers say themselves nothing magical happened here and absolutely

07:26.920 --> 07:31.400
no direction was given to anything other than a few initial instructions.

07:31.400 --> 07:35.760
And so if they were able to create this after just half an hour on a laptop we can only

07:35.760 --> 07:40.280
imagine what could happen on a typical planet with a lot more complexity and a lot more

07:40.280 --> 07:43.360
chemical diversity after billions of years.

07:43.360 --> 07:46.440
Or I guess that's the basic conclusion from this study.

07:46.440 --> 07:50.520
Because of the limitations of the computer power here obviously nothing more complex

07:50.520 --> 07:55.000
arose from this and obviously none of these programs developed into some kind of a super

07:55.000 --> 07:59.340
complex intelligence or even when beyond simple self-replication.

07:59.340 --> 08:04.360
And that's actually one of the biggest criticisms from various biological sciences so far.

08:04.360 --> 08:08.920
Here they don't actually think this would lead to more complex behavior automatically.

08:08.920 --> 08:13.360
Or in other words even though self-replication is very impressive they don't think other

08:13.360 --> 08:15.600
things would follow afterwards.

08:15.600 --> 08:19.840
And they do actually provide several examples where this might have occurred using other

08:19.840 --> 08:22.800
experiments even using things like RNA.

08:22.800 --> 08:28.160
There are several experiments that used various RNA molecules where various RNA strands were

08:28.160 --> 08:33.680
replicated in a test tube which resulted in RNA getting shorter and shorter and replication

08:33.680 --> 08:35.600
getting faster and faster.

08:35.600 --> 08:39.600
And in those experiments even though I guess replication was achieved it was not rewarding

08:39.600 --> 08:45.160
complexity instead it was rewarding simplicity and the speed of self-replication.

08:45.160 --> 08:49.440
And biologists believe that this is maybe the opposite of what's needed to explain the

08:49.440 --> 08:52.280
complexity of biological life on Earth.

08:52.280 --> 08:56.660
And so basically they don't think that having a bunch of self-replicators is going to guarantee

08:56.660 --> 08:58.160
further complexity.

08:58.160 --> 09:02.560
Mostly because here it's the simplicity and the speed that seems to guide everything.

09:02.560 --> 09:08.400
On top of this because life actually involves DNA, RNA, proteins and a huge interplay of

09:08.400 --> 09:14.480
various complex systems just looking at self-replication is not really helping us enough to understand

09:14.480 --> 09:16.200
how all of this could evolve.

09:16.200 --> 09:21.160
Nevertheless in this study there is maybe some evidence that this is the beginning of

09:21.160 --> 09:26.040
something more complex it just it would need more time and possibly more computational

09:26.040 --> 09:27.040
power.

09:27.040 --> 09:30.880
On top of this the scientists actually tried this using other languages or other simple

09:30.880 --> 09:35.880
languages such as FORTH, Z80 and the language known as SUBLIQ.

09:35.880 --> 09:41.080
And interestingly only SUBLIQ was actually unable to produce self-replicators.

09:41.080 --> 09:45.680
And here they believe it's because it required a much longer length of code with the longer

09:45.680 --> 09:51.200
code no longer being able to produce replication instead of producing random programs.

09:51.200 --> 09:55.840
With the main conclusion here being that the length plays a very important role in determining

09:55.840 --> 09:59.040
if self-replication is going to become possible.

09:59.040 --> 10:03.920
But naturally except for this simple replication there are still so many unanswered questions

10:03.920 --> 10:06.000
and so many things that we still don't know.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.840
For example how much additional complexity can be produced given enough time.

10:10.840 --> 10:16.080
Also what exactly causes the self-replication to appear and is there any way for us to guide

10:16.080 --> 10:19.880
the evolution of these systems to produce even more complexity.

10:19.880 --> 10:25.360
Lastly is the evolution produced here similar to what we observe in real world or are there

10:25.360 --> 10:30.280
any specific notable differences that we can want to explore in future studies.

10:30.280 --> 10:34.720
And so basically at least for now the only thing we know for sure is that self-replication

10:34.720 --> 10:36.440
seems to appear naturally.

10:36.440 --> 10:39.480
But everything else is still kind of undetermined.

10:39.480 --> 10:44.160
Although because this is a fundamental property of life technically this is a super important

10:44.160 --> 10:45.160
discovery.

10:45.160 --> 10:49.520
And one thing that kind of connects to all of this is once again research by von Neumann

10:49.520 --> 10:54.080
and his colleague from the Los Alamos laboratory, Stanislav Ulam.

10:54.080 --> 10:59.560
In the early 1940s way before the discovery of DNA and way before computers became relatively

10:59.560 --> 11:05.320
widespread the first research on self-replication was actually done with clay crystals.

11:05.320 --> 11:11.000
And that's because surprisingly except for DNA and RNA crystals produced inside clay

11:11.000 --> 11:14.880
exhibit the only other known form of self-replication.

11:14.880 --> 11:19.640
And that's because clay is made out of large number of small crystals inside the environment

11:19.640 --> 11:21.560
that promotes crystal growth.

11:21.560 --> 11:26.240
But it also promotes the growth of various irregularities especially when placed in water

11:26.240 --> 11:27.240
solution.

11:27.240 --> 11:31.640
And so as these crystals grow and develop they actually end up producing irregularities

11:31.640 --> 11:37.200
that then break apart forming new crystals, new irregularities and even undergoing a kind

11:37.200 --> 11:39.120
of evolutionary change.

11:39.120 --> 11:43.800
Which actually surprisingly corresponds to all of the definitions of self-replication

11:43.800 --> 11:46.960
and mimics the biological life extremely well.

11:46.960 --> 11:49.360
Which of course raises a lot of questions.

11:49.360 --> 11:53.600
For example does that actually mean that some kind of a crystalline life could exist somewhere

11:53.600 --> 11:57.600
out there produced by clay on some other planet somewhere out there?

11:57.600 --> 12:02.520
Or maybe this is actually how life on Earth formed as well starting from these simple

12:02.520 --> 12:07.720
clays early on with these crystals eventually replaced by various organic molecules.

12:07.720 --> 12:11.240
All of these questions have actually been tackled by various papers but we just don't

12:11.240 --> 12:12.760
have any answers yet.

12:12.760 --> 12:17.120
Nevertheless because of this new study hopefully this will lead to more interest, additional

12:17.120 --> 12:20.840
simulations and possibly additional exciting discoveries.

12:20.840 --> 12:25.120
But until those future studies or until other discoveries that's pretty much it.
