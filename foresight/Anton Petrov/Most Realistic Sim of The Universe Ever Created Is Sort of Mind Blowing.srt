1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
Hello and for person this is Anton and today we are going to be discussing the creation of the

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,720
most complex to date simulation of the entire universe. The simulation that was recently

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,680
created by the scientists in Japan that sort of dwarfs everything else that ever existed.

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,720
But I also wanted to discuss some of the previous simulations and what all of this is for

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,800
and what the scientists are trying to discover by doing all of this over and over.

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,880
And let's actually start with some of the more basic simulations I've been using on the channel

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,760
for several years, the ones you can technically purchase and use yourselves. So for example,

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,520
universe sandbox and the beautiful space engine are both meant to simulate the universe to some

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:45,280
extent, with both of them doing a pretty good job, at least when it comes to smaller patches of the

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,320
universe, such as for example, taking a look at what happens in the solar system, or trying to

11
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,840
imagine what a typical galaxy or possibly a global cluster looks like. But they both obviously have

12
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,280
their shortcomings. For space engine, it's the fact that things here are more or less static.

13
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,480
So for example, a star system is not going to be interacting with another star system.

14
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:11,200
And so in this global cluster, for example, nothing is actually moving anywhere. Everything

15
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,960
here is more or less in the same spot. Now that's obviously because of the limitations

16
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,960
and the inability to potentially simulate this on the grandiose scales like what we have right here.

17
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,080
Now, universe sandbox does almost the opposite. It tries to simulate the gravitational interactions

18
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,280
between various objects. But depending on how powerful your computer is, even here you're going

19
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,800
to start reaching your limitations pretty quickly. So in this simulation, once these moons start to

20
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:44,240
collide and start creating more particles, that's when my computer can no longer really handle it.

21
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,760
But when it comes to actual scientific simulations, normally this required a super computer because

22
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:54,800
of the limitations you can clearly see right here. And so in the last decade or so, a lot of

23
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,520
different scientific teams started to create their own simulations, such as this one right here,

24
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,960
known as the universe machine, that tried to use as many cores as possible in order to create the

25
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,800
most realistic simulation of as many objects as possible, interacting as they would in real life.

26
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:17,360
And every few years, these so called universes in a box or universes in a bottle have improved

27
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,120
so dramatically and have improved so much that the effects they're showing us in real time allow

28
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,840
the scientists to discover various features of galactic and star formation that they actually

29
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,320
did not know existed. And in the last few years, I've been using a lot of these videos like the one

30
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:38,080
you see right here that were originally created back in 2019 by the biggest and the most complex

31
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:44,080
simulation of the universe in the box. This is known as the illustrious project. This project is

32
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,080
freely available on the website in the description. And the cool thing here is that if you were to

33
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,360
click on the explorer, you sort of get the snapshot of one of the simulations where you can sort of

34
00:02:53,360 --> 00:03:00,160
zoom in and see one of the extremely detailed simulations of one of these universes in a box.

35
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,160
That also allows you to change various properties of what you're actually looking at,

36
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:09,600
and allows you to visualize what a lot of the interaction between galaxies usually ends up

37
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,480
producing. Now I've previously discussed this project and the simulation in the video from

38
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,160
approximately two years ago, but just to summarize, the biggest simulation today involves creating a

39
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:26,400
tiny universe that's approximately 230 million light years across and contain tens of thousands

40
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,840
of different galaxies with a tremendous amount of detail and a lot of interacting particles.

41
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:38,400
Here there was approximately 20 billion particles representing dark matter, gas, stars and a lot of

42
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,840
supermassive black holes. With the actual simulation lasting around 13.8 billion years,

43
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,280
representing the age of the universe. And the point of the simulation was to try to build a

44
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,480
representation of the universe as it evolved since the beginning of the Big Bang, allowing the

45
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,840
scientists to visualize how all of these structures interact and what exactly they end up forming,

46
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,960
both in terms of large-scale structures, but also in terms of the smaller interactions and small

47
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:10,560
structures inside of every galaxy. Now to produce this, the obviously, as I mentioned before,

48
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,080
required a supercomputer. In this case, it used 16,000 different cores and it's known as the

49
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:21,520
Hazel Hunt supercomputer located in Germany. And to create all this, it required the scientists

50
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:26,800
approximately a year of continuous calculations. According to them, if I were to use my computer

51
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,560
to do this, it would take me approximately 15,000 years. But because of these simulations and the

52
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,840
actual representation of the universe, this allowed them to discover several major phenomena

53
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,960
that essentially involved a lot of the interaction between various types of particles in this model

54
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,280
universe. For example, one of the major discoveries, as you can kind of see in this simulation,

55
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,440
is a surprisingly common formation of various disk-shaped galaxies. They seem to be way more

56
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:59,040
common than we originally anticipated. With many of these galaxies also containing things like spiral

57
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,960
arms, things like bulges, and even various galactic bars extending across the galaxy.

58
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,360
More importantly, some of the more unknown discoveries were actually in regards to the

59
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,800
interaction between supernova explosions and the activity from supermassive black holes.

60
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,400
Here it was all in regards to various types of outflow of gas that created a kind of feedback

61
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,760
loop with the gas being kicked out of the galaxy through supernova and supermassive black holes

62
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:31,520
just to then return back into the galaxy to feed the black hole and create more supernova once again.

63
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:37,040
Normally, this is how we believe a lot of galaxies form today and how they evolve over time.

64
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:42,000
And interestingly enough, a lot of these phenomena discovered were absolutely not programmed into

65
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,120
the simulation. They sort of just happened naturally. And that's because of the complexity

66
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,080
of the simulation itself, because of the number of particles, and also because of the time it

67
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:58,560
represented in this simulation of the universe. But now the Japanese scientists took it a step

68
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,800
further. Okay, like a really big step further. Introducing the Japanese project they refer

69
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:11,920
to as Uju, which is Japanese for outer space. And this project is, well, it's basically illustrious,

70
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:18,640
but like on steroids, it's illustrious times 100. And I'm not exaggerating this. It literally

71
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:24,480
involves two trillion different particles. And it also represents a universe that's around

72
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:30,800
9.6 billion light years across. It's bigger, it's more complex, and it's way, way more advanced

73
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,520
than illustrious was ever able to produce. Now, let me just show you the part of the simulation

74
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,480
that was released by the scientists that you can also find in the link in the description below.

75
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,960
And so what you're looking at right here is basically the interaction between a lot of these

76
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:52,160
particles and the creation of the, once again, universe in the box. But this time a tremendously

77
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:58,240
massive universe, a universe that is almost exactly the same size as the actual observable

78
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:04,480
universe, just a little bit smaller. And honestly, this is absolutely mind blowing. So we don't

79
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:09,120
really know what's going to be discovered here just yet, mostly because the whole point of this

80
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,400
was just to create a simulation. But chances are a lot of incredible discoveries are going to be made

81
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,760
once the data from this is analyzed. And once the scientists start to look deep into what actually

82
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:25,280
was created by a lot of these particles interacting. And interestingly, even the scientists themselves

83
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,240
refer to this as a kind of a time machine. Here you can go forward, you can go backward,

84
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,360
you can stop time, you can zoom in, you can choose a single galaxy, you can choose a single

85
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,960
galactic cluster, and you can basically do anything you want with it and investigate anything you want

86
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,800
just to discover various properties created in this unusual and somewhat realistic universe.

87
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,680
And what makes this, I guess, to some extent more exciting, especially for amateur scientists or

88
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,760
amateur astronomers, is that all this is freely available to download. But it's not just like a

89
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,720
simulation, you can download like Space Engine. It does require a little bit of knowledge in terms

90
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,600
of data retrieval, and also a little bit of knowledge in terms of data processing as well.

91
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:12,720
And so for example, in order to access something like this, and to be able to see what the scientists

92
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,840
saw in their simulation, you would first have to access the data through this publicly available

93
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,680
dataset right here. With I guess the easiest way to do this, being the GitHub page right here,

94
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,560
which has a collection of different Python tools and Jupyter notebooks that have several

95
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,040
examples and several commands that you can use, especially if you have knowledge of Python,

96
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:37,600
with the basics on how to install this and how to use this available in there as well.

97
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:43,520
But because this data represents approximately 100 terabytes of data, it would be very, very

98
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,640
difficult to download all of this and to try to recreate this on your own computer. And so to

99
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,280
try to recreate something like this, it would require a little bit of data processing and the

100
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:58,720
ability to create visualizations using the available data. And so there are no actual videos

101
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:04,240
available just yet. But ultimately, one day, hopefully someone is going to be able to produce

102
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,440
something similar to Space Engine by using the data collected from these various studies,

103
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,200
allowing us to go into any time frame, and allowing us to zoom in on any of these objects,

104
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,440
in order to see some of these most incredible and most detailed representations

105
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,320
of different objects in the universe. So in this particular case, the simulation was able to create

106
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,920
something that was only a few light years across. Many of us in theory should be able to see various

107
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:35,200
star systems and possibly even certain planets. But to be honest, to create something like this

108
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,960
as an actual simulation similar to Space Engine might never really be possible, simply because of

109
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:46,880
the complexity of things involved here. Now it'll be great if someone did it, but chances are it

110
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:52,080
will never happen. Mostly because the actual commercial technology is just not there yet.

111
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,240
We might be able to have a lot of visualizations and a lot of videos similar to this one,

112
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,280
but we're not probably going to have a Space Engine-like exploration tool for quite a while.

113
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:06,000
Now hopefully someone proves me wrong, but chances are we're going to be limited to just looking at

114
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,040
the data or looking at videos. Either way though, it's still quite impressive at what the sciences

115
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:17,440
were able to achieve using the computer you see right here, known as Atterui II, the most powerful

116
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,720
supercomputer when it comes to astronomical simulations. Now one intriguing feature coming

117
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:28,400
out of this simulation is the fact that they mostly focused on the idea of dark matter. And so in

118
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:34,240
this simulation, the mysterious halos of dark matter more or less control what you see forming.

119
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,920
And notice how the actual formation does seem to resemble the actual universe we observe in real

120
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:46,240
life as well. Which of course implies that, well maybe, dark mirror halos exist after all. At the

121
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,680
same time, the purpose of the simulation is to actually try to see the future as well, or essentially

122
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,960
try to see the eventual fate of the universe. Now it's obviously not entirely clear what exactly

123
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,880
is going to happen to the universe from this simulation, and the scientists have not really

124
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:06,000
mentioned anything just yet. But I'm sure a lot of future studies investigating the last moments

125
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,920
of the simulation might be able to show us what's going to happen to a lot of galactic clusters,

126
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,120
a lot of different large formations, including of course galaxies, and a lot of other mysterious

127
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:23,120
formations such as the extremely massive cosmic web. And in case you were wondering, the supercomputer

128
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:29,040
contained over 40,000 different computer cores and also took over a year to generate approximately

129
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:35,440
three petabytes of data that would then convert to 100 terabytes of data that can be easily analyzed

130
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:41,040
using Python. And so it's sort of mind blowing to know that hypothetically you could download the

131
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:47,040
entire universe, and it's only about 100 terabytes in size. And since this is approximately 100 times

132
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,760
more advanced than the previously mentioned illustrious project, I can only imagine what we're going

133
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:58,240
to achieve in the next five or even 10 years. For all we know, we might be able to create a universe

134
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,440
that physically contains actual planets and moons, and potentially even has a lot of other

135
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,600
interactions on the surface as well. Now this is obviously something we might be able to create

136
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,920
in the future, and in theory nothing is really stopping us from getting there. But for now,

137
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:18,400
in 2021, this right here is the best we have. A universe that's about nine billion light years

138
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:24,560
across, and that represents approximately 13 billion years of evolution. It contains approximately

139
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:30,000
two trillion particles, with each of the particles representing something different, possibly a part

140
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,040
of the star, possibly some sort of a gas, or maybe a black hole. And so definitely a really

141
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,640
impressive achievement. By the way, you can learn more about all of this from the paper in the

142
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:43,600
description below. And so I guess for now, that's sort of all I wanted to mention. Although maybe

143
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,600
there's one more thing. The idea of a universe as a simulation, and I'm sure someone in the

144
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,720
comments is going to mention this, does this actually prove that maybe we live in an actual

145
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,960
supercomputer simulation created by something else? Well, to some extent, there's really no way to

146
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:06,560
prove this. And to other extent, what we're creating with these simulations, like the space

147
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:12,000
engine, or the one I just showed you, the one known as Uchu, it doesn't necessarily represent

148
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,760
everything we know about the universe. For example, it does not at all simulate the idea of particle

149
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:24,880
physics. It also completely ignores the idea of quantum physics. This mostly shows us the interaction

150
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:30,240
between various particles influencing each other gravitationally. And so because of this,

151
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:36,800
it still is extremely simple compared to what we actually have as a reality and where we live.

152
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:43,280
And trying to simulate this would be almost impossible. Just the fact that we have to simulate

153
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:49,040
quantum physics and the idea of particles being in different places at different times, that would

154
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,400
be almost impossible. That's something we cannot achieve even using some of the most complex

155
00:13:54,400 --> 00:14:00,160
computers on the planet right now. And so since there is no actual way to prove or disprove this,

156
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:05,360
I'm just going to leave this as a kind of a philosophical question. But in my opinion,

157
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,080
it's very likely that we do not live in a simulation. And there are actually some really

158
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,800
strong arguments against that. And we'll talk about some of these in some of the future videos.

159
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,480
But anyway, until then, check out relevant links in the description below, subscribe if

160
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,360
you still haven't, share this with someone who loves learning about space and sciences,

161
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,880
and maybe come back tomorrow to learn something else. Maybe support this channel on Patreon by

162
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,400
joining a channel membership, or by buying the wonderful person t-shirt you can find in the

163
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,400
description. Stay wonderful, I'll see you tomorrow, and as always, bye-bye.
