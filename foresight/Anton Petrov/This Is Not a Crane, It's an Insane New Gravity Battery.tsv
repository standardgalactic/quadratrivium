0	3760	Hello, wonderful person, this is Anton, and today we're going to be discussing what's
3760	10380	known as a gravity battery, and specifically this right here, this unusual looking tower
10380	15520	that's in reality a gravity battery, something that a company known as Energy Vault has now
15520	20040	actually developed and is trying to sell to a lot of different bidders.
20040	24000	But more specifically, we're going to be discussing the idea behind these gravity batteries,
24000	29200	how they operate, and more importantly, how they might transform the future of humanity.
29200	32240	But let's start small, actually this small.
32240	36520	Now you might have seen a grandfather clock before, but this is actually a good example
36520	41760	of how humans have learned to use gravity to operate something and to produce energy.
41760	47080	The pendulum in the clock here generates all of its energy from essentially the gravity
47080	48080	of planet Earth.
48080	53640	And this idea of gravity as energy allows us to produce things like, for example, hydroplants.
53640	59800	A hydro plant, or a dam, operates entirely on the idea of gravity generating energy,
59800	64200	with the motion of water generating energy by driving the turbines.
64200	68080	And not so long ago, I actually went on a kind of a tour trying to explore different ways
68080	72960	energy is generated here in South Korea, because I actually wanted to make a video about all
72960	73960	of this.
73960	78160	Unfortunately, COVID happened, and so all of these plants are currently off limits.
78160	82240	But during that time, when I was exploring various plants, I discovered some really really
82240	86860	awesome ideas and some really interesting constructions that are currently used to either
86860	89640	generate or store energy.
89640	95480	For example, Korea actually has the world's largest tidal wave energy generator.
95480	97800	It generates energy through the tides.
97800	100520	And we'll talk more about this in some of the future videos, because I actually wanted
100520	103280	to dedicate an entire video to this.
103280	108280	But by basically using the tides to control the flow of water, it's possible to generate
108280	113680	a lot of energy in the same way that it's usually done in a hydro plant or a dam.
113680	117240	And so a lot of countries around the world right now are basically trying to find new
117240	120680	ways to generate energy without the use of fossil fuels.
120680	124000	That's obviously the priority for a lot of countries out there.
124000	126160	But generating energy is one thing.
126160	128920	The other thing is how do you actually store it?
128920	134400	And storing energy, especially renewable energy, is a completely different problem that currently
134400	136840	does not have a very good solution.
136840	141920	And that's mostly because a lot of renewable energies like solar energy or wind energy
141920	143840	is not really constant.
143840	148360	It usually deviates with time and sometimes depends on certain conditions.
148360	151720	For example, solar energy obviously does not work at night.
151720	155960	And so the only way to make this work is to collect a lot of energy during the day and
155960	160760	then store a lot of energy for the nighttime so that it can also be used at night.
160760	165160	But this obviously requires a lot of batteries and an extremely efficient way of storing
165160	166520	all of this.
166520	170200	Chemical batteries, unfortunately, are not good enough, especially in certain climates
170200	175200	such as in extremely hot climates or extremely cold climates where chemical batteries usually
175200	176960	discharge very quickly.
176960	181200	And so during my mini tour of different power plants, including nuclear power plants, I've
181200	185720	got to talk to some experts who actually told me how a lot of this works.
185720	189440	And it's really interesting how most of the countries solve this problem.
189440	193920	They usually rely on gravity for providing extra battery storage.
193920	198920	And specifically they normally use sort of like the reverse of what a typical hydro plant
198920	199920	is.
199920	204760	It's known as PSH, pumped storage hydroelectricity.
204760	206920	And the idea is really simple.
206920	212120	During daytime, for example, you use all of this extra energy to drive a lot of water
212120	216480	uphill and then store it in some sort of a reservoir on top.
216480	220000	Normally this is done with some sort of a mountain and some sort of a reservoir on top
220000	223880	of the mountain with different countries using different techniques.
223880	228440	For example, here's a picture of a pumped storage plant in Lithuania that essentially
228440	233000	stores extra water right here in this reservoir and will then release the water when the energy
233000	234000	is required.
234000	236440	And here's another one from Wales.
236440	242200	This has a very funky Welsh name that I don't think I'm going to try to pronounce.
242200	246840	And so once all of this water is collected somewhere on top, at night the flow reverses
246840	250680	and all of this water can now generate extra electricity needed.
250680	255520	And so today this is the most widely used gravity battery often used in conjunction
255520	261240	with a lot of renewable energy, usually massive solar power plants, but sometimes also wind
261240	266320	power plants or a lot of other power plants that require additional energy storage.
266320	270840	And generally speaking, a lot of these batteries are designed to work for at least 12 hours
270840	271840	without stopping.
271840	275160	So basically they have enough energy for approximately half a day.
275160	277960	And today there are quite a lot of them out there.
277960	283000	Only a third of them are in the United States, with a total storage capacity of US alone
283000	286600	being approximately 250 gigawatt hours.
286600	288040	That's a lot of energy.
288040	292320	But there's another country that has even more of them, and that's Switzerland.
292320	297880	And the reason why Switzerland basically explains the problem with this type of energy, or this
297880	299680	type of energy storage.
299680	304160	The type of a gravity generator that we're talking about here requires mountains and
304160	306320	it requires a lot of water.
306320	310160	Without mountains and water, it would be extremely difficult to produce an efficient
310160	315640	gravity battery, or at least a PSH, a pump storage hydroelectricity.
315640	320320	And so most countries with mountains and water usually have no problem producing these, which
320320	324600	is why there are quite a lot of them in South Korea, a lot of them in America, and quite
324600	326240	a lot of them in Switzerland.
326240	331840	But if a country is more or less flat, or if it's a desert, it becomes kind of impossible
331840	336080	to produce this simply because there are just no resources and it would be way more expensive
336080	339760	to produce this than even a chemical type of a battery.
339760	343680	And by the way, fun fact, but the first one of these batteries was originally produced
343680	349240	in Switzerland as well, back in 1907, so this is a super old technology.
349240	351200	And so anyway, how do you solve this?
351200	355600	If a country has no mountains and no water, something else has to be used.
355600	360480	And that's where these two new startups decided to solve this problem by producing something
360480	362000	quite brilliant actually.
362000	366640	And the first startup is EnergyVolt, and this is what their battery looks like.
366640	371440	And even though it might not look like a battery, it actually can store quite a lot of energy,
371440	374440	even more than some of these hydroelectric ones.
374440	378840	And the design itself, despite being kind of ugly, is modifiable and will most likely
378840	380080	change in time.
380080	384440	Okay, so how exactly does this work, and what exactly are they trying to achieve here?
384440	389920	Well, in essence, it's an automated crane that picks up various blocks and stores them
389920	391080	on top.
391080	394280	But these blocks acting as potential energy.
394280	399720	And so as extra energy is generated by the wind turbines or by solar power plants, all
399720	405200	of this is stored and eventually deposited right on top of the crane itself.
405200	410480	Then during nighttime, for example, or when there's no wind, it starts doing the opposite.
410480	416320	It starts to slowly bring all of these blocks down and thus generates energy simply through
416320	420080	the action of gravity pulling on all of these blocks.
420080	424760	And the way that all of this is designed right now, it's entirely automated and runs with
424760	427560	almost no supervision whatsoever.
427560	432680	And so instead of using water, it uses either concrete or even some sort of recycled heavy
432680	433880	material.
433880	438160	And interestingly enough, it's able to store quite a lot of energy, and it's also able
438160	441200	to produce quite a lot of energy when it needs to be produced.
441200	446480	So the capacity here is pretty high, with a total output of approximately 5 megawatt,
446480	449080	meaning that it can supply energy to a small town.
449280	453560	And as you can see from this video, they already have a first function in prototype, currently
453560	456160	located in one of the cities in Switzerland.
456160	460840	This tower is approximately 110 meters in height and is able to move very massive concrete
460840	463960	blocks, approximately 35 ton each.
463960	468200	The total storage here is approximately 80 megawatt hours of energy.
468200	472040	More importantly, this company has officially signed their first commercial deal, meaning
472040	476400	that they're going to be producing these for some of the energy companies in Europe.
476400	480880	And at the moment, they're designed to be powered entirely by solar energy and then
480880	483880	store all of this energy for 910 years.
483880	488360	And from what we know so far, the next tower is going to be somewhere in Louisiana, with
488360	492520	a total storage capacity of nearly 500 megawatt hour.
492520	493520	That's a lot of storage.
493520	496880	It will be enough to power a somewhat small city.
496880	501160	And it's expected to start operating sometime next year in 2022.
501160	505360	And they also are planning to build at least one in Ohio and at least one in Canada somewhere
505360	506840	in British Columbia.
506840	510600	So this is a super exciting project and I'm really looking forward to see where all of
510600	511600	this goes.
511600	516880	And interestingly, this is even a little bit more efficient than the PSH I previously mentioned.
516880	521640	Unlike the hydroelectric energy storage, this has slightly more efficiency in terms of storing
521640	525640	energy and in terms of then retrieving it from the blocks themselves.
525640	532700	The overall efficiency here is approximately 85% versus about 75% for a hydroelectric plant.
532700	534640	But that's not the only company doing this.
534920	539600	There's a company somewhere in the UK known as Gravitricity and they have a somewhat similar
539600	543080	but a slightly different concept of gravity energy.
543080	548480	They're planning to rely on abandoned, very deep mine shafts, usually several kilometers
548480	549480	in depth.
549480	553200	And instead of using a crane and a bunch of blocks, they're going to be lowering one
553200	557920	single block deep into the mine shaft with the block itself being anywhere from about
557920	561640	500 to even 5000 tons in mass.
561640	566200	And by essentially moving this block just a few centimeters deep into the mine, it's
566200	571480	able to generate a tremendous amount of electricity or vice versa, it's able to store a tremendous
571480	574880	amount of electricity as the block is lifted from the bottom.
574880	579120	With the current model being able to store approximately 10 megawatt hour of energy.
579120	584000	But this particular project is still in its infancy and is still looking for more investors.
584000	587860	Specifically though, it's also sort of reliant on these abandoned mines.
587860	591480	So obviously only some countries are going to be able to produce this.
591480	596860	Regardless, it shows us that this is a really exciting time for innovation and for a lot
596860	601280	of new technologies and a lot of new concepts that are going to be appearing just to help
601280	607160	us transition from the idea of fossil fuels and chemical energy to the idea of renewable
607160	609600	energy and renewable storage.
609600	614000	And so I'm actually kind of excited to see where all of this goes in the next five years.
614000	618040	But I guess until we learn more or until some other company invents or designs something
618040	620520	else incredible, that's all I wanted to mention.
