1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
114% this is Anton and today we're going to be discussing some of the new propositions

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,840
in regards to the unusual phenomena that could be happening in many different black holes out

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,200
there. Phenomena that the scientists are now exploring using quantum physics and something

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,080
that can actually help us understand why certain galaxies have certain features and what happens

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,680
in certain black holes that spin really really fast. But before we discuss the black holes it's

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,720
actually important to understand where a lot of these ideas originally come from. They do come

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,400
from quantum physics and specifically from this really unusual state of matter usually referred

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:43,600
to as BEC back or Bose-Einstein condensate. Something that happens to certain particles of gas

9
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,800
as you cool them down and here these particles have to be what's known as bosons. Usually this

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,080
is particles of helium. As you start to cool them down each particle starts to acquire bigger and

11
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:59,600
bigger wave function and eventually each of these wave functions start to sort of interact

12
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,760
and then even joins in creating one single wave function that sort of acts as a single object

13
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,960
and this is what we refer to as BEC. This is essentially how the scientists have been studying

14
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,440
various quantum effects and this particular state of matter has even been created on the

15
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,840
International Space Station and we've discussed this in a video a few years ago. But the most

16
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,800
important part about this state of matter is that it really doesn't act like classical matter

17
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:30,960
at all anymore. It acts like quantum wave and its behavior and its interaction with other stuff

18
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,160
can actually no longer be predicted by classical physics. For example if you do something to this

19
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,560
matter and you expect certain type of reaction based on what we know about, well I just say

20
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,760
normal helium gas, the results are always going to be very surprising. It almost always acts in a

21
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:51,280
way that's only explainable through quantum physics and because of this in the last few decades

22
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,240
BEC has been one of the most exciting prospects in order to learn more about quantum physics

23
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,200
and to try to understand how things work in the universe. But while studying these BECs not so long

24
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,120
ago I guess around six years ago back in 2016 the scientists discovered a new feature of these

25
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:13,440
unusual BECs specifically the ones that tend to spin really fast. So in classical physics for any

26
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,480
kind of a spinning liquid or a spinning gas we can generally predict exactly what's going to

27
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,480
happen to it as it spins faster and faster. As a matter of fact hydrodynamics and aerodynamics

28
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,800
explain a lot of different spinning water and gas particles with extreme precision but for these

29
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,640
quantum particles for these BECs things are very very different. A typical BEC as it starts spinning

30
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,760
around starts exhibiting entirely different structures and entire different properties

31
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,240
something that nobody could predict until the scientists started to do it. They actually start

32
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:51,600
producing what the scientists today refer to as vortices but even here they're not at all similar

33
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,880
to the ones we find in the water they don't act like this at all. Here's a microscopic image

34
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:03,120
of what they really look like this right here is a spinning back spinning those Einstein condensate

35
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,800
and each of those tiny dots you see those are tiny vortices that appear inside the condensate.

36
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,560
But here we're talking about a kind of a quantized vortex that's formed with very unusual patterns

37
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,000
or almost resembling a crystal. Here are some other examples from similar experiments but

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,440
with the back of different size and so as you can see this phenomenon seems to appear in any kind of

39
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,920
quantum material that starts to spin and when analyzed this particular lattice store looks like this

40
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,120
it has a very specific order and it does seem to have its own physics that it obeys using quantum

41
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,680
mechanics. Today the scientists believe that these vortices can actually help us explain

42
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,800
different phenomena such as superfluidity and superconductivity but even though the scientists

43
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,040
have been studying them for many years they're not there just yet. You can actually see some other

44
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,960
visual examples in one of the links in the description with quite a lot of different

45
00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:00,400
recreations of what happens to these backs as they start spinning but these patterns are not

46
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,560
permanent and they do change with time for example in this case it lasted for about 40

47
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,880
seconds before changing into something a little bit different so these are definitely not permanent

48
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,760
structures. But what does it have to do with black holes? Well when it comes to trying to explain

49
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:19,200
what black holes are a lot of modern physicists realize that modern physics cannot explain what

50
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,480
happens inside the black holes. For example Einstein's relativity only explains what happens right

51
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:30,400
until the event horizon with everything after this basically becoming infinity which in physics just

52
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,960
means that we don't really have a good explanation and so the scientists believe that quantum physics

53
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,480
and potentially the idea known as quantum gravity could provide some answers and what happens inside

54
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:46,400
black holes could be entirely quantum in nature in other words black holes could be basically very

55
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:52,080
unusual quantum states of matter although naturally at the moment nobody really knows exactly how any

56
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:58,400
of this works but there is at least one hypothesis and it does involve the hypothetical gravitons.

57
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,880
The particles at some scientists believe could explain how gravity works as well

58
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,720
and in this case because this is also a boson it can also create backs very similar to the ones that

59
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,920
I showed you previously and thus exhibiting very similar effects especially when it starts spinning

60
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:19,360
and so a few years ago the scientists proposed that well maybe backs with gravitons could explain

61
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,640
certain types of black holes with the most recent paper that was just released going further establishing

62
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,760
that for a spinning black hole assuming that it's made out of quantum gravitons it can actually start

63
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:35,440
forming these vortices as well with each individual vortex then producing a lot of other additional

64
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,880
effects we observe including very powerful magnetic lines that currently do not have a really good

65
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,600
explanation otherwise or in other words the implication here is really simple some black holes

66
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,520
or maybe even all black holes could be these very unusual boson condensates and might possess

67
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,640
very similar properties to what we actually discover in these experiments as well even showing

68
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:02,640
that a black hole that's spinning can also be described using similar physics but as a graviton

69
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:08,800
boson condensate that possesses the vorticity implying that this right here is just a bigger

70
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,680
version of what the scientists were able to take pictures of before and if correct it might provide

71
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,560
certain answers for a lot of different mysteries of black holes first of all it would suggest that a

72
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,240
very fast spinning black hole would be really stable and would not emit any Hawking radiation

73
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,200
in other words it would not evaporate and would actually remain relatively constant at the same

74
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,800
time they show that each individual vortex traps a lot of the magnetic field lines which end up

75
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,000
releasing very specific signatures that will be impossible to produce otherwise and that can

76
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,120
actually be experimentally detected by observing certain black holes which of course implies that

77
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,400
this is not just a hypothesis it's a testable hypothesis that some future studies could maybe

78
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,760
test if very specific observations are made at the same time this could also explain why

79
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:02,000
certain galaxies and specifically certain galactic nuclei tend to have very powerful magnetic fields

80
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,880
that otherwise are kind of difficult to explain as a matter of fact a lot of the magnetic fields

81
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:13,280
in various galaxies could maybe stem from these unusual effects from these unusual spinning quantum

82
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:19,200
black holes but i guess more importantly it also adds a completely new property to a typical black

83
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:24,880
hole today black holes are generally explained by three different properties we have mass we also

84
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:30,720
have charge and lastly we have spin so we know that all black holes spin they all have mass

85
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,560
and they all possess at least some charge but now there seems to be a fourth one vorticity

86
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,200
this could also be one of the features if the scientists behind the study are somewhat correct

87
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:46,400
and if black holes are indeed quantum objects exhibiting quantum features similar to what we

88
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,240
find in both Einstein condensates here on earth so definitely a pretty exciting proposition but

89
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,240
something that we're not going to be able to test until some of the future very powerful

90
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,920
observations from extremely distant black holes that we know most likely spin so definitely not

91
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:07,760
testable anytime soon but back in general always create so many different surprises as a matter

92
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,840
of fact we'll discuss some of them in videos you can find in the description below and so this

93
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,720
unusual state of matter can definitely help us resolve a lot of different mysteries in the universe

94
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,680
that would be very difficult to explain otherwise because this right here allows us to test and to

95
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:28,240
observe quantum effects by using actual microscopes and by using larger objects something that normally

96
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,520
only happens on subatomic scales but for now i guess we're not going to know if this is correct

97
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:38,320
