00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
Hello, wonderful person, this is Anton, and today we're going to be discussing what's

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:10,380
known as a gravity battery, and specifically this right here, this unusual looking tower

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,520
that's in reality a gravity battery, something that a company known as Energy Vault has now

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:20,040
actually developed and is trying to sell to a lot of different bidders.

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,000
But more specifically, we're going to be discussing the idea behind these gravity batteries,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,200
how they operate, and more importantly, how they might transform the future of humanity.

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,240
But let's start small, actually this small.

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,520
Now you might have seen a grandfather clock before, but this is actually a good example

9
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,760
of how humans have learned to use gravity to operate something and to produce energy.

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,080
The pendulum in the clock here generates all of its energy from essentially the gravity

11
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,080
of planet Earth.

12
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:53,640
And this idea of gravity as energy allows us to produce things like, for example, hydroplants.

13
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,800
A hydro plant, or a dam, operates entirely on the idea of gravity generating energy,

14
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,200
with the motion of water generating energy by driving the turbines.

15
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,080
And not so long ago, I actually went on a kind of a tour trying to explore different ways

16
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,960
energy is generated here in South Korea, because I actually wanted to make a video about all

17
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,960
of this.

18
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:18,160
Unfortunately, COVID happened, and so all of these plants are currently off limits.

19
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,240
But during that time, when I was exploring various plants, I discovered some really really

20
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,860
awesome ideas and some really interesting constructions that are currently used to either

21
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,640
generate or store energy.

22
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,480
For example, Korea actually has the world's largest tidal wave energy generator.

23
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,800
It generates energy through the tides.

24
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,520
And we'll talk more about this in some of the future videos, because I actually wanted

25
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,280
to dedicate an entire video to this.

26
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,280
But by basically using the tides to control the flow of water, it's possible to generate

27
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,680
a lot of energy in the same way that it's usually done in a hydro plant or a dam.

28
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,240
And so a lot of countries around the world right now are basically trying to find new

29
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,680
ways to generate energy without the use of fossil fuels.

30
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,000
That's obviously the priority for a lot of countries out there.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,160
But generating energy is one thing.

32
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,920
The other thing is how do you actually store it?

33
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:14,400
And storing energy, especially renewable energy, is a completely different problem that currently

34
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,840
does not have a very good solution.

35
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,920
And that's mostly because a lot of renewable energies like solar energy or wind energy

36
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,840
is not really constant.

37
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,360
It usually deviates with time and sometimes depends on certain conditions.

38
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,720
For example, solar energy obviously does not work at night.

39
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,960
And so the only way to make this work is to collect a lot of energy during the day and

40
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:40,760
then store a lot of energy for the nighttime so that it can also be used at night.

41
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,160
But this obviously requires a lot of batteries and an extremely efficient way of storing

42
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,520
all of this.

43
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,200
Chemical batteries, unfortunately, are not good enough, especially in certain climates

44
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:55,200
such as in extremely hot climates or extremely cold climates where chemical batteries usually

45
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,960
discharge very quickly.

46
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,200
And so during my mini tour of different power plants, including nuclear power plants, I've

47
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,720
got to talk to some experts who actually told me how a lot of this works.

48
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,440
And it's really interesting how most of the countries solve this problem.

49
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,920
They usually rely on gravity for providing extra battery storage.

50
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,920
And specifically they normally use sort of like the reverse of what a typical hydro plant

51
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,920
is.

52
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,760
It's known as PSH, pumped storage hydroelectricity.

53
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,920
And the idea is really simple.

54
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:32,120
During daytime, for example, you use all of this extra energy to drive a lot of water

55
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,480
uphill and then store it in some sort of a reservoir on top.

56
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,000
Normally this is done with some sort of a mountain and some sort of a reservoir on top

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,880
of the mountain with different countries using different techniques.

58
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,440
For example, here's a picture of a pumped storage plant in Lithuania that essentially

59
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:53,000
stores extra water right here in this reservoir and will then release the water when the energy

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
is required.

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,440
And here's another one from Wales.

62
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:02,200
This has a very funky Welsh name that I don't think I'm going to try to pronounce.

63
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,840
And so once all of this water is collected somewhere on top, at night the flow reverses

64
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,680
and all of this water can now generate extra electricity needed.

65
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,520
And so today this is the most widely used gravity battery often used in conjunction

66
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:21,240
with a lot of renewable energy, usually massive solar power plants, but sometimes also wind

67
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:26,320
power plants or a lot of other power plants that require additional energy storage.

68
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,840
And generally speaking, a lot of these batteries are designed to work for at least 12 hours

69
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,840
without stopping.

70
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,160
So basically they have enough energy for approximately half a day.

71
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,960
And today there are quite a lot of them out there.

72
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:43,000
Only a third of them are in the United States, with a total storage capacity of US alone

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,600
being approximately 250 gigawatt hours.

74
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,040
That's a lot of energy.

75
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,320
But there's another country that has even more of them, and that's Switzerland.

76
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,880
And the reason why Switzerland basically explains the problem with this type of energy, or this

77
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,680
type of energy storage.

78
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,160
The type of a gravity generator that we're talking about here requires mountains and

79
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,320
it requires a lot of water.

80
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,160
Without mountains and water, it would be extremely difficult to produce an efficient

81
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,640
gravity battery, or at least a PSH, a pump storage hydroelectricity.

82
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:20,320
And so most countries with mountains and water usually have no problem producing these, which

83
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,600
is why there are quite a lot of them in South Korea, a lot of them in America, and quite

84
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,240
a lot of them in Switzerland.

85
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,840
But if a country is more or less flat, or if it's a desert, it becomes kind of impossible

86
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,080
to produce this simply because there are just no resources and it would be way more expensive

87
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,760
to produce this than even a chemical type of a battery.

88
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,680
And by the way, fun fact, but the first one of these batteries was originally produced

89
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,240
in Switzerland as well, back in 1907, so this is a super old technology.

90
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,200
And so anyway, how do you solve this?

91
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,600
If a country has no mountains and no water, something else has to be used.

92
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,480
And that's where these two new startups decided to solve this problem by producing something

93
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,000
quite brilliant actually.

94
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,640
And the first startup is EnergyVolt, and this is what their battery looks like.

95
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:11,440
And even though it might not look like a battery, it actually can store quite a lot of energy,

96
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,440
even more than some of these hydroelectric ones.

97
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,840
And the design itself, despite being kind of ugly, is modifiable and will most likely

98
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,080
change in time.

99
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,440
Okay, so how exactly does this work, and what exactly are they trying to achieve here?

100
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:29,920
Well, in essence, it's an automated crane that picks up various blocks and stores them

101
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,080
on top.

102
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,280
But these blocks acting as potential energy.

103
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:39,720
And so as extra energy is generated by the wind turbines or by solar power plants, all

104
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:45,200
of this is stored and eventually deposited right on top of the crane itself.

105
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:50,480
Then during nighttime, for example, or when there's no wind, it starts doing the opposite.

106
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:56,320
It starts to slowly bring all of these blocks down and thus generates energy simply through

107
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,080
the action of gravity pulling on all of these blocks.

108
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,760
And the way that all of this is designed right now, it's entirely automated and runs with

109
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,560
almost no supervision whatsoever.

110
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,680
And so instead of using water, it uses either concrete or even some sort of recycled heavy

111
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,880
material.

112
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,160
And interestingly enough, it's able to store quite a lot of energy, and it's also able

113
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,200
to produce quite a lot of energy when it needs to be produced.

114
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,480
So the capacity here is pretty high, with a total output of approximately 5 megawatt,

115
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,080
meaning that it can supply energy to a small town.

116
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,560
And as you can see from this video, they already have a first function in prototype, currently

117
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,160
located in one of the cities in Switzerland.

118
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,840
This tower is approximately 110 meters in height and is able to move very massive concrete

119
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,960
blocks, approximately 35 ton each.

120
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,200
The total storage here is approximately 80 megawatt hours of energy.

121
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,040
More importantly, this company has officially signed their first commercial deal, meaning

122
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:56,400
that they're going to be producing these for some of the energy companies in Europe.

123
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,880
And at the moment, they're designed to be powered entirely by solar energy and then

124
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,880
store all of this energy for 910 years.

125
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:08,360
And from what we know so far, the next tower is going to be somewhere in Louisiana, with

126
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,520
a total storage capacity of nearly 500 megawatt hour.

127
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,520
That's a lot of storage.

128
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,880
It will be enough to power a somewhat small city.

129
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,160
And it's expected to start operating sometime next year in 2022.

130
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:25,360
And they also are planning to build at least one in Ohio and at least one in Canada somewhere

131
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,840
in British Columbia.

132
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,600
So this is a super exciting project and I'm really looking forward to see where all of

133
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,600
this goes.

134
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,880
And interestingly, this is even a little bit more efficient than the PSH I previously mentioned.

135
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,640
Unlike the hydroelectric energy storage, this has slightly more efficiency in terms of storing

136
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,640
energy and in terms of then retrieving it from the blocks themselves.

137
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:52,700
The overall efficiency here is approximately 85% versus about 75% for a hydroelectric plant.

138
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,640
But that's not the only company doing this.

139
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:59,600
There's a company somewhere in the UK known as Gravitricity and they have a somewhat similar

140
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,080
but a slightly different concept of gravity energy.

141
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:08,480
They're planning to rely on abandoned, very deep mine shafts, usually several kilometers

142
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,480
in depth.

143
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,200
And instead of using a crane and a bunch of blocks, they're going to be lowering one

144
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,920
single block deep into the mine shaft with the block itself being anywhere from about

145
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,640
500 to even 5000 tons in mass.

146
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:26,200
And by essentially moving this block just a few centimeters deep into the mine, it's

147
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:31,480
able to generate a tremendous amount of electricity or vice versa, it's able to store a tremendous

148
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,880
amount of electricity as the block is lifted from the bottom.

149
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,120
With the current model being able to store approximately 10 megawatt hour of energy.

150
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,000
But this particular project is still in its infancy and is still looking for more investors.

151
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,860
Specifically though, it's also sort of reliant on these abandoned mines.

152
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,480
So obviously only some countries are going to be able to produce this.

153
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,860
Regardless, it shows us that this is a really exciting time for innovation and for a lot

154
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:01,280
of new technologies and a lot of new concepts that are going to be appearing just to help

155
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:07,160
us transition from the idea of fossil fuels and chemical energy to the idea of renewable

156
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,600
energy and renewable storage.

157
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,000
And so I'm actually kind of excited to see where all of this goes in the next five years.

158
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,040
But I guess until we learn more or until some other company invents or designs something

159
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,520
else incredible, that's all I wanted to mention.

160
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,880
You can find all the links for each of the companies and their projects in the description

161
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,080
below and subscribe if you still haven't, share this with someone who was learning about

162
