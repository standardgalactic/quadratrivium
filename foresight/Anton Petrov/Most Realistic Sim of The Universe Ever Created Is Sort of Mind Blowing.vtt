00:00.000 --> 00:05.040
Hello and for person this is Anton and today we are going to be discussing the creation of the

00:05.040 --> 00:10.720
most complex to date simulation of the entire universe. The simulation that was recently

00:10.720 --> 00:15.680
created by the scientists in Japan that sort of dwarfs everything else that ever existed.

00:16.320 --> 00:20.720
But I also wanted to discuss some of the previous simulations and what all of this is for

00:20.720 --> 00:24.800
and what the scientists are trying to discover by doing all of this over and over.

00:24.800 --> 00:28.880
And let's actually start with some of the more basic simulations I've been using on the channel

00:28.880 --> 00:33.760
for several years, the ones you can technically purchase and use yourselves. So for example,

00:33.760 --> 00:39.520
universe sandbox and the beautiful space engine are both meant to simulate the universe to some

00:39.520 --> 00:45.280
extent, with both of them doing a pretty good job, at least when it comes to smaller patches of the

00:45.280 --> 00:50.320
universe, such as for example, taking a look at what happens in the solar system, or trying to

00:50.320 --> 00:55.840
imagine what a typical galaxy or possibly a global cluster looks like. But they both obviously have

00:55.840 --> 01:01.280
their shortcomings. For space engine, it's the fact that things here are more or less static.

01:01.280 --> 01:06.480
So for example, a star system is not going to be interacting with another star system.

01:06.480 --> 01:11.200
And so in this global cluster, for example, nothing is actually moving anywhere. Everything

01:11.200 --> 01:16.960
here is more or less in the same spot. Now that's obviously because of the limitations

01:16.960 --> 01:22.960
and the inability to potentially simulate this on the grandiose scales like what we have right here.

01:22.960 --> 01:28.080
Now, universe sandbox does almost the opposite. It tries to simulate the gravitational interactions

01:28.080 --> 01:33.280
between various objects. But depending on how powerful your computer is, even here you're going

01:33.280 --> 01:38.800
to start reaching your limitations pretty quickly. So in this simulation, once these moons start to

01:38.800 --> 01:44.240
collide and start creating more particles, that's when my computer can no longer really handle it.

01:44.240 --> 01:49.760
But when it comes to actual scientific simulations, normally this required a super computer because

01:49.760 --> 01:54.800
of the limitations you can clearly see right here. And so in the last decade or so, a lot of

01:54.800 --> 01:59.520
different scientific teams started to create their own simulations, such as this one right here,

01:59.520 --> 02:04.960
known as the universe machine, that tried to use as many cores as possible in order to create the

02:04.960 --> 02:10.800
most realistic simulation of as many objects as possible, interacting as they would in real life.

02:10.800 --> 02:17.360
And every few years, these so called universes in a box or universes in a bottle have improved

02:17.360 --> 02:23.120
so dramatically and have improved so much that the effects they're showing us in real time allow

02:23.120 --> 02:27.840
the scientists to discover various features of galactic and star formation that they actually

02:27.840 --> 02:32.320
did not know existed. And in the last few years, I've been using a lot of these videos like the one

02:32.320 --> 02:38.080
you see right here that were originally created back in 2019 by the biggest and the most complex

02:38.080 --> 02:44.080
simulation of the universe in the box. This is known as the illustrious project. This project is

02:44.080 --> 02:48.080
freely available on the website in the description. And the cool thing here is that if you were to

02:48.080 --> 02:53.360
click on the explorer, you sort of get the snapshot of one of the simulations where you can sort of

02:53.360 --> 03:00.160
zoom in and see one of the extremely detailed simulations of one of these universes in a box.

03:00.160 --> 03:04.160
That also allows you to change various properties of what you're actually looking at,

03:04.160 --> 03:09.600
and allows you to visualize what a lot of the interaction between galaxies usually ends up

03:09.600 --> 03:14.480
producing. Now I've previously discussed this project and the simulation in the video from

03:14.480 --> 03:20.160
approximately two years ago, but just to summarize, the biggest simulation today involves creating a

03:20.160 --> 03:26.400
tiny universe that's approximately 230 million light years across and contain tens of thousands

03:26.400 --> 03:31.840
of different galaxies with a tremendous amount of detail and a lot of interacting particles.

03:31.840 --> 03:38.400
Here there was approximately 20 billion particles representing dark matter, gas, stars and a lot of

03:38.400 --> 03:43.840
supermassive black holes. With the actual simulation lasting around 13.8 billion years,

03:43.840 --> 03:49.280
representing the age of the universe. And the point of the simulation was to try to build a

03:49.280 --> 03:54.480
representation of the universe as it evolved since the beginning of the Big Bang, allowing the

03:54.480 --> 03:59.840
scientists to visualize how all of these structures interact and what exactly they end up forming,

03:59.840 --> 04:04.960
both in terms of large-scale structures, but also in terms of the smaller interactions and small

04:04.960 --> 04:10.560
structures inside of every galaxy. Now to produce this, the obviously, as I mentioned before,

04:10.560 --> 04:16.080
required a supercomputer. In this case, it used 16,000 different cores and it's known as the

04:16.080 --> 04:21.520
Hazel Hunt supercomputer located in Germany. And to create all this, it required the scientists

04:21.520 --> 04:26.800
approximately a year of continuous calculations. According to them, if I were to use my computer

04:26.800 --> 04:32.560
to do this, it would take me approximately 15,000 years. But because of these simulations and the

04:32.560 --> 04:37.840
actual representation of the universe, this allowed them to discover several major phenomena

04:37.840 --> 04:42.960
that essentially involved a lot of the interaction between various types of particles in this model

04:42.960 --> 04:47.280
universe. For example, one of the major discoveries, as you can kind of see in this simulation,

04:47.280 --> 04:53.440
is a surprisingly common formation of various disk-shaped galaxies. They seem to be way more

04:53.440 --> 04:59.040
common than we originally anticipated. With many of these galaxies also containing things like spiral

04:59.040 --> 05:04.960
arms, things like bulges, and even various galactic bars extending across the galaxy.

05:04.960 --> 05:09.360
More importantly, some of the more unknown discoveries were actually in regards to the

05:09.360 --> 05:14.800
interaction between supernova explosions and the activity from supermassive black holes.

05:14.800 --> 05:20.400
Here it was all in regards to various types of outflow of gas that created a kind of feedback

05:20.400 --> 05:25.760
loop with the gas being kicked out of the galaxy through supernova and supermassive black holes

05:25.760 --> 05:31.520
just to then return back into the galaxy to feed the black hole and create more supernova once again.

05:31.520 --> 05:37.040
Normally, this is how we believe a lot of galaxies form today and how they evolve over time.

05:37.040 --> 05:42.000
And interestingly enough, a lot of these phenomena discovered were absolutely not programmed into

05:42.000 --> 05:47.120
the simulation. They sort of just happened naturally. And that's because of the complexity

05:47.120 --> 05:52.080
of the simulation itself, because of the number of particles, and also because of the time it

05:52.080 --> 05:58.560
represented in this simulation of the universe. But now the Japanese scientists took it a step

05:58.560 --> 06:04.800
further. Okay, like a really big step further. Introducing the Japanese project they refer

06:04.800 --> 06:11.920
to as Uju, which is Japanese for outer space. And this project is, well, it's basically illustrious,

06:11.920 --> 06:18.640
but like on steroids, it's illustrious times 100. And I'm not exaggerating this. It literally

06:18.640 --> 06:24.480
involves two trillion different particles. And it also represents a universe that's around

06:24.480 --> 06:30.800
9.6 billion light years across. It's bigger, it's more complex, and it's way, way more advanced

06:30.800 --> 06:35.520
than illustrious was ever able to produce. Now, let me just show you the part of the simulation

06:35.520 --> 06:40.480
that was released by the scientists that you can also find in the link in the description below.

06:40.480 --> 06:44.960
And so what you're looking at right here is basically the interaction between a lot of these

06:44.960 --> 06:52.160
particles and the creation of the, once again, universe in the box. But this time a tremendously

06:52.160 --> 06:58.240
massive universe, a universe that is almost exactly the same size as the actual observable

06:58.240 --> 07:04.480
universe, just a little bit smaller. And honestly, this is absolutely mind blowing. So we don't

07:04.480 --> 07:09.120
really know what's going to be discovered here just yet, mostly because the whole point of this

07:09.120 --> 07:14.400
was just to create a simulation. But chances are a lot of incredible discoveries are going to be made

07:14.400 --> 07:19.760
once the data from this is analyzed. And once the scientists start to look deep into what actually

07:19.760 --> 07:25.280
was created by a lot of these particles interacting. And interestingly, even the scientists themselves

07:25.280 --> 07:30.240
refer to this as a kind of a time machine. Here you can go forward, you can go backward,

07:30.240 --> 07:35.360
you can stop time, you can zoom in, you can choose a single galaxy, you can choose a single

07:35.360 --> 07:40.960
galactic cluster, and you can basically do anything you want with it and investigate anything you want

07:40.960 --> 07:46.800
just to discover various properties created in this unusual and somewhat realistic universe.

07:46.800 --> 07:51.680
And what makes this, I guess, to some extent more exciting, especially for amateur scientists or

07:51.680 --> 07:57.760
amateur astronomers, is that all this is freely available to download. But it's not just like a

07:57.760 --> 08:02.720
simulation, you can download like Space Engine. It does require a little bit of knowledge in terms

08:02.720 --> 08:07.600
of data retrieval, and also a little bit of knowledge in terms of data processing as well.

08:07.600 --> 08:12.720
And so for example, in order to access something like this, and to be able to see what the scientists

08:12.720 --> 08:17.840
saw in their simulation, you would first have to access the data through this publicly available

08:17.840 --> 08:23.680
dataset right here. With I guess the easiest way to do this, being the GitHub page right here,

08:23.680 --> 08:28.560
which has a collection of different Python tools and Jupyter notebooks that have several

08:28.560 --> 08:33.040
examples and several commands that you can use, especially if you have knowledge of Python,

08:33.040 --> 08:37.600
with the basics on how to install this and how to use this available in there as well.

08:37.600 --> 08:43.520
But because this data represents approximately 100 terabytes of data, it would be very, very

08:43.520 --> 08:48.640
difficult to download all of this and to try to recreate this on your own computer. And so to

08:48.640 --> 08:53.280
try to recreate something like this, it would require a little bit of data processing and the

08:53.280 --> 08:58.720
ability to create visualizations using the available data. And so there are no actual videos

08:58.720 --> 09:04.240
available just yet. But ultimately, one day, hopefully someone is going to be able to produce

09:04.240 --> 09:09.440
something similar to Space Engine by using the data collected from these various studies,

09:09.440 --> 09:15.200
allowing us to go into any time frame, and allowing us to zoom in on any of these objects,

09:15.200 --> 09:19.440
in order to see some of these most incredible and most detailed representations

09:19.440 --> 09:24.320
of different objects in the universe. So in this particular case, the simulation was able to create

09:24.320 --> 09:29.920
something that was only a few light years across. Many of us in theory should be able to see various

09:29.920 --> 09:35.200
star systems and possibly even certain planets. But to be honest, to create something like this

09:35.200 --> 09:40.960
as an actual simulation similar to Space Engine might never really be possible, simply because of

09:40.960 --> 09:46.880
the complexity of things involved here. Now it'll be great if someone did it, but chances are it

09:46.880 --> 09:52.080
will never happen. Mostly because the actual commercial technology is just not there yet.

09:52.080 --> 09:56.240
We might be able to have a lot of visualizations and a lot of videos similar to this one,

09:56.240 --> 10:01.280
but we're not probably going to have a Space Engine-like exploration tool for quite a while.

10:01.280 --> 10:06.000
Now hopefully someone proves me wrong, but chances are we're going to be limited to just looking at

10:06.000 --> 10:11.040
the data or looking at videos. Either way though, it's still quite impressive at what the sciences

10:11.040 --> 10:17.440
were able to achieve using the computer you see right here, known as Atterui II, the most powerful

10:17.440 --> 10:22.720
supercomputer when it comes to astronomical simulations. Now one intriguing feature coming

10:22.720 --> 10:28.400
out of this simulation is the fact that they mostly focused on the idea of dark matter. And so in

10:28.400 --> 10:34.240
this simulation, the mysterious halos of dark matter more or less control what you see forming.

10:34.240 --> 10:39.920
And notice how the actual formation does seem to resemble the actual universe we observe in real

10:39.920 --> 10:46.240
life as well. Which of course implies that, well maybe, dark mirror halos exist after all. At the

10:46.240 --> 10:51.680
same time, the purpose of the simulation is to actually try to see the future as well, or essentially

10:51.680 --> 10:56.960
try to see the eventual fate of the universe. Now it's obviously not entirely clear what exactly

10:56.960 --> 11:00.880
is going to happen to the universe from this simulation, and the scientists have not really

11:00.880 --> 11:06.000
mentioned anything just yet. But I'm sure a lot of future studies investigating the last moments

11:06.000 --> 11:11.920
of the simulation might be able to show us what's going to happen to a lot of galactic clusters,

11:11.920 --> 11:17.120
a lot of different large formations, including of course galaxies, and a lot of other mysterious

11:17.120 --> 11:23.120
formations such as the extremely massive cosmic web. And in case you were wondering, the supercomputer

11:23.120 --> 11:29.040
contained over 40,000 different computer cores and also took over a year to generate approximately

11:29.040 --> 11:35.440
three petabytes of data that would then convert to 100 terabytes of data that can be easily analyzed

11:35.440 --> 11:41.040
using Python. And so it's sort of mind blowing to know that hypothetically you could download the

11:41.040 --> 11:47.040
entire universe, and it's only about 100 terabytes in size. And since this is approximately 100 times

11:47.040 --> 11:51.760
more advanced than the previously mentioned illustrious project, I can only imagine what we're going

11:51.760 --> 11:58.240
to achieve in the next five or even 10 years. For all we know, we might be able to create a universe

11:58.240 --> 12:03.440
that physically contains actual planets and moons, and potentially even has a lot of other

12:03.440 --> 12:07.600
interactions on the surface as well. Now this is obviously something we might be able to create

12:07.600 --> 12:11.920
in the future, and in theory nothing is really stopping us from getting there. But for now,

12:11.920 --> 12:18.400
in 2021, this right here is the best we have. A universe that's about nine billion light years

12:18.400 --> 12:24.560
across, and that represents approximately 13 billion years of evolution. It contains approximately

12:24.560 --> 12:30.000
two trillion particles, with each of the particles representing something different, possibly a part

12:30.000 --> 12:35.040
of the star, possibly some sort of a gas, or maybe a black hole. And so definitely a really

12:35.040 --> 12:38.640
impressive achievement. By the way, you can learn more about all of this from the paper in the

12:38.640 --> 12:43.600
description below. And so I guess for now, that's sort of all I wanted to mention. Although maybe

12:43.600 --> 12:49.600
there's one more thing. The idea of a universe as a simulation, and I'm sure someone in the

12:49.600 --> 12:54.720
comments is going to mention this, does this actually prove that maybe we live in an actual

12:54.720 --> 13:00.960
supercomputer simulation created by something else? Well, to some extent, there's really no way to

13:00.960 --> 13:06.560
prove this. And to other extent, what we're creating with these simulations, like the space

13:06.560 --> 13:12.000
engine, or the one I just showed you, the one known as Uchu, it doesn't necessarily represent

13:12.000 --> 13:17.760
everything we know about the universe. For example, it does not at all simulate the idea of particle

13:17.760 --> 13:24.880
physics. It also completely ignores the idea of quantum physics. This mostly shows us the interaction

13:24.880 --> 13:30.240
between various particles influencing each other gravitationally. And so because of this,

13:30.240 --> 13:36.800
it still is extremely simple compared to what we actually have as a reality and where we live.

13:36.800 --> 13:43.280
And trying to simulate this would be almost impossible. Just the fact that we have to simulate

13:43.280 --> 13:49.040
quantum physics and the idea of particles being in different places at different times, that would

13:49.040 --> 13:54.400
be almost impossible. That's something we cannot achieve even using some of the most complex

13:54.400 --> 14:00.160
computers on the planet right now. And so since there is no actual way to prove or disprove this,

14:00.400 --> 14:05.360
I'm just going to leave this as a kind of a philosophical question. But in my opinion,

14:05.920 --> 14:10.080
it's very likely that we do not live in a simulation. And there are actually some really

14:10.080 --> 14:14.800
strong arguments against that. And we'll talk about some of these in some of the future videos.

14:14.800 --> 14:18.480
