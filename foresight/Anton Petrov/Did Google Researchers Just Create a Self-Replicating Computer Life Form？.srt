00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,040
Hello and for person, this is Anton and today we are going to discuss something slightly

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,880
different or I guess maybe not so different.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:12,540
In a sense that we are going to be discussing the idea behind the evolution of life but here

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,720
based on a somewhat intriguing study by the researchers from Google and specifically a

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:23,360
study that tries to mimic the evolution of life by using an extremely simple computer

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:28,880
code and in a process they actually do make some somewhat unexpected discoveries.

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,200
All of which you can discover yourself by reading the study in the description below.

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,520
And so let's actually discuss this in a little bit more detail and talk about why this is

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,880
maybe kind of important but also what it shows us in regards to the concept known as self-replication.

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,160
But first I guess just a brief history.

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,160
So this idea of trying to simulate a life like environment by using mathematical principles

12
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,800
and computer simulations is obviously not new.

13
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,160
The famous Conway's game of life is probably the best known example where a kind of an automated

14
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,200
system can actually be devised mathematically by introducing just a few simple rules and

15
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,520
by then seeing how the system evolves.

16
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,920
You can actually try the examples of this in one of the links in the description but

17
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,200
in essence this is known to produce quite a few interesting patterns with some of these

18
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,360
patterns possessing somewhat interesting behavior such as motion.

19
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,200
But the main ideas behind all of this essentially start with a kind of a mathematical slash

20
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,880
philosophical exploration back in the 1940s and 1950s with essentially one of the main

21
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,320
I guess fathers of this concept being a famous engineer, mathematician and physicist John

22
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,440
von Neumann.

23
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,680
And you might know his name because he was also responsible for the concept known as

24
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,480
the von Neumann probes or basically self-replicating probes that could technically exist somewhere

25
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:50,760
out there and represent a kind of an end game for various alien civilizations that could

26
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,240
help them colonize the rest of the universe.

27
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,920
And so he was actually super fascinated with the idea of self-replication with his research

28
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,440
basically inspiring a lot of other mathematicians and a lot of other scientists to try to look

29
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,040
into this a little bit further.

30
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:09,200
Ironically though he was able to propose all of this before we even knew DNA existed

31
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,440
and so in some sense his research became fundamental in order to help us understand how various

32
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,840
biological units are able to reproduce and are also able to evolve over time.

33
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,920
And so in some sense this new study by Google is kind of a continuation of all of this work

34
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:30,160
after several decades but in this case discovers something that we've never really seen before

35
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,040
which is why I thought it was kind of worth exploring.

36
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,520
So for example in that game of life I showed you previously one thing that it does not

37
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:43,280
do is basically create its own copies or evolve in a way where it mimics life itself.

38
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,320
And that's despite being really complex otherwise.

39
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,560
But in this new study the scientists took a slightly different approach.

40
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,840
First of all they chose an extremely simple language.

41
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,720
Okay this is going to be hard.

42
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,440
The name of the language is right here on the screen and it's essentially a somewhat

43
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:06,360
simple but somewhat eccentric language created by a computer science student back in 1993

44
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,360
that contains only eight simple commands but is fully functional otherwise.

45
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,200
And though it's not really meant for practical use mostly because all of the programs end

46
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,480
up being super long it is nevertheless quite functional and obviously can be used to write

47
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,520
programs.

48
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,440
And Wikipedia article below does actually provide some examples such as the famous

49
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,760
Hello World program that in this case takes quite a few lines of code.

50
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,040
And so because this language is so minimalistic it's actually surprisingly useful for all

51
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,520
kinds of evolutionary research.

52
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:42,520
Here because there are only eight instructions everything becomes extremely simple and extremely

53
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,080
easy to implement.

54
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,600
And so for this particular study the researchers basically did something super simple.

55
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:54,160
They created a kind of a digital primordial soup and to some extent you can see it visualized

56
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,280
right here.

57
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,000
And what you're looking at right here are a bunch of random programs that don't really

58
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,360
have anything in them other than a few really simple instructions.

59
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,120
But for the most part there is no general instruction, there is no rule, there is no

60
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,200
regulation all of this is just completely random.

61
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,320
So in some sense it directly mimics the game of life.

62
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:17,120
But most importantly there is absolutely no pressure to do anything.

63
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,720
All of these individual programs and there are millions of them here are left to do whatever

64
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,720
they want to do.

65
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,720
And this is really important.

66
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:29,720
There is absolutely no rule or any kind of regulation to evolve or to self-replicate.

67
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,960
And so now all of these individual pieces of code start to interact randomly combining

68
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,880
and mixing together and also executing additional instructions as they slowly change because

69
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,480
of random interactions.

70
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,880
And in this case this is done for millions of generations.

71
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,600
And the assumption here based on the idea that there is really no instruction, no regulation,

72
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,000
no particular direction or force or pressure was that basically all of this is just going

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,440
to randomly change over time possibly shift here and there but most likely not really

74
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,720
affect anything too dramatically.

75
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,680
So for example unlike previous simulations these programs don't even have to do anything

76
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,960
because there is no point system and they don't actually win or lose anything.

77
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,240
So the expectation being that because the population was capped at a fixed number they

78
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,640
are going to do a bunch of random stuff but do nothing that's comprehensible or that

79
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,160
has any direction.

80
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,320
And this is where the surprise starts.

81
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:28,720
In every single case they did something that was directional and they did evolve into something

82
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,800
unexpected.

83
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,640
And you can actually see this visualized in the bottom left corner and it's going to

84
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,720
start happening really soon.

85
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:41,480
In every single simulation some of these programs eventually emerged as self-replicating taking

86
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,720
over the rest of the simulation.

87
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,520
And this emergence of self-replication seems to have happened multiple times and in many

88
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,800
cases some of these self-replicators were much better than others and thus started to basically

89
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,880
kind of compete for space even though this was never programmed or never intended.

90
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,960
So in this case you can see that one of these first replicators is now taking over everything.

91
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,520
But eventually after a few more generations more and more competition started to appear

92
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,960
and in some cases would completely overwhelm all of the other programs.

93
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,920
Which is really bizarre because this mimics a biological system without any programming

94
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,480
or any code to tell it to do so.

95
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,320
And because there was no explicit fitness function yet fitness still emerged and some programs

96
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,320
were basically better than others this was a relatively big shock.

97
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,240
And you can see all of this in a couple of YouTube videos I posted in the description

98
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,560
where it helps you visualize these programs after millions and millions of evolutionary processes.

99
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,480
And in many of these experiments it sometimes took up to millions of steps before this unusual

100
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,440
behavior started to appear.

101
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,720
But interestingly enough some of these programs were basically just run on a laptop and after

102
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,840
about half an hour in every single case you would see self-replication.

103
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,720
And this is of course really interesting.

104
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,400
Even though we understand evolution to a pretty good extent we still have no idea how various

105
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,080
molecules early on eventually became self-replicating.

106
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,120
And even though this experiment doesn't really tell us exactly what happened what it does

107
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,200
kind of show us is essentially some kind of an inherent mechanism that possibly creates

108
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,080
complexity from absolutely nothing.

109
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,440
Or basically the implication here is that complex biological behavior can spontaneously

110
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,880
appear if you wait long enough.

111
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,920
And so as the researchers say themselves nothing magical happened here and absolutely

112
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,400
no direction was given to anything other than a few initial instructions.

113
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,760
And so if they were able to create this after just half an hour on a laptop we can only

114
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:40,280
imagine what could happen on a typical planet with a lot more complexity and a lot more

115
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,360
chemical diversity after billions of years.

116
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,440
Or I guess that's the basic conclusion from this study.

117
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,520
Because of the limitations of the computer power here obviously nothing more complex

118
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,000
arose from this and obviously none of these programs developed into some kind of a super

119
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,340
complex intelligence or even when beyond simple self-replication.

120
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:04,360
And that's actually one of the biggest criticisms from various biological sciences so far.

121
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,920
Here they don't actually think this would lead to more complex behavior automatically.

122
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,360
Or in other words even though self-replication is very impressive they don't think other

123
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,600
things would follow afterwards.

124
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,840
And they do actually provide several examples where this might have occurred using other

125
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,800
experiments even using things like RNA.

126
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,160
There are several experiments that used various RNA molecules where various RNA strands were

127
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,680
replicated in a test tube which resulted in RNA getting shorter and shorter and replication

128
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,600
getting faster and faster.

129
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,600
And in those experiments even though I guess replication was achieved it was not rewarding

130
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:45,160
complexity instead it was rewarding simplicity and the speed of self-replication.

131
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,440
And biologists believe that this is maybe the opposite of what's needed to explain the

132
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,280
complexity of biological life on Earth.

133
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:56,660
And so basically they don't think that having a bunch of self-replicators is going to guarantee

134
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,160
further complexity.

135
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,560
Mostly because here it's the simplicity and the speed that seems to guide everything.

136
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:08,400
On top of this because life actually involves DNA, RNA, proteins and a huge interplay of

137
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:14,480
various complex systems just looking at self-replication is not really helping us enough to understand

138
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,200
how all of this could evolve.

139
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,160
Nevertheless in this study there is maybe some evidence that this is the beginning of

140
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:26,040
something more complex it just it would need more time and possibly more computational

141
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,040
power.

142
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,880
On top of this the scientists actually tried this using other languages or other simple

143
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,880
languages such as FORTH, Z80 and the language known as SUBLIQ.

144
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:41,080
And interestingly only SUBLIQ was actually unable to produce self-replicators.

145
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,680
And here they believe it's because it required a much longer length of code with the longer

146
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:51,200
code no longer being able to produce replication instead of producing random programs.

147
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,840
With the main conclusion here being that the length plays a very important role in determining

148
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,040
if self-replication is going to become possible.

149
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,920
But naturally except for this simple replication there are still so many unanswered questions

150
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,000
and so many things that we still don't know.

151
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,840
For example how much additional complexity can be produced given enough time.

152
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:16,080
Also what exactly causes the self-replication to appear and is there any way for us to guide

153
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,880
the evolution of these systems to produce even more complexity.

154
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:25,360
Lastly is the evolution produced here similar to what we observe in real world or are there

155
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,280
any specific notable differences that we can want to explore in future studies.

156
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:34,720
And so basically at least for now the only thing we know for sure is that self-replication

157
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,440
seems to appear naturally.

158
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,480
But everything else is still kind of undetermined.

159
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,160
Although because this is a fundamental property of life technically this is a super important

160
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,160
discovery.

161
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:49,520
And one thing that kind of connects to all of this is once again research by von Neumann

162
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:54,080
and his colleague from the Los Alamos laboratory, Stanislav Ulam.

163
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:59,560
In the early 1940s way before the discovery of DNA and way before computers became relatively

164
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:05,320
widespread the first research on self-replication was actually done with clay crystals.

165
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:11,000
And that's because surprisingly except for DNA and RNA crystals produced inside clay

166
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,880
exhibit the only other known form of self-replication.

167
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,640
And that's because clay is made out of large number of small crystals inside the environment

168
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,560
that promotes crystal growth.

169
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:26,240
But it also promotes the growth of various irregularities especially when placed in water

170
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,240
solution.

171
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,640
And so as these crystals grow and develop they actually end up producing irregularities

172
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:37,200
that then break apart forming new crystals, new irregularities and even undergoing a kind

173
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,120
of evolutionary change.

174
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,800
Which actually surprisingly corresponds to all of the definitions of self-replication

175
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,960
and mimics the biological life extremely well.

176
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,360
Which of course raises a lot of questions.

177
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,600
For example does that actually mean that some kind of a crystalline life could exist somewhere

178
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,600
out there produced by clay on some other planet somewhere out there?

179
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,520
Or maybe this is actually how life on Earth formed as well starting from these simple

180
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:07,720
clays early on with these crystals eventually replaced by various organic molecules.

181
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,240
All of these questions have actually been tackled by various papers but we just don't

182
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,760
have any answers yet.

183
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,120
Nevertheless because of this new study hopefully this will lead to more interest, additional

184
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,840
simulations and possibly additional exciting discoveries.

185
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:25,120
But until those future studies or until other discoveries that's pretty much it.
