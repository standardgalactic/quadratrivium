00:00.000 --> 00:14.180
I don't have any slides because I decided to talk like 18 minutes ago.

00:14.180 --> 00:19.080
So my name is Chris Pfeiffer and I'm the head of data science at Cluster Truck.

00:19.080 --> 00:23.200
And so I thought I'd use this as an opportunity to explain what makes us different from a

00:23.200 --> 00:29.160
real restaurant and or a traditional restaurant and how we use data to our advantage.

00:29.160 --> 00:34.600
So in a traditional restaurant, they have data that they call the PMix or the product

00:34.600 --> 00:35.600
mix.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.840
And this is the main thing driving their menu decisions.

00:37.840 --> 00:43.720
And what this is is just how many of each item on their menu that they've sold each week.

00:43.720 --> 00:48.800
And at Cluster Truck when we launched, it was important for us to have that same PMix so

00:48.800 --> 00:51.640
that our chefs could look at that in the way that they're used to.

00:51.640 --> 00:56.600
But we also are able to go much deeper since we're a vertically integrated digital-only

00:56.600 --> 00:57.600
kitchen.

00:57.840 --> 01:00.840
How many people have heard of Cluster Truck or tried Cluster?

01:00.840 --> 01:06.520
OK, so Cluster Truck is basically a tech-enabled delivery-only kitchen.

01:06.520 --> 01:10.000
So the main difference between us and someone like DoorDash or Grubhub is that we cook all

01:10.000 --> 01:15.680
our own food and manage our own menu and are engineered 100% for delivery instead of basically

01:15.680 --> 01:19.860
attaching digital ordering and delivery to existing restaurants.

01:19.860 --> 01:26.360
So what we look at in addition to the traditional PMixes, for a certain item, if someone ordered

01:26.560 --> 01:30.560
it for the first time, what percentage of the time do they come back and order Cluster

01:30.560 --> 01:31.920
Truck again?

01:31.920 --> 01:36.040
We also look at for a certain item, if somebody ordered that on their first order.

01:36.040 --> 01:40.480
What percent of the time when they do order again, are they ordering that same item versus

01:40.480 --> 01:41.920
something else?

01:41.920 --> 01:47.480
And so we use this to optimize not only the most popular menu items, but the menu items

01:47.480 --> 01:53.480
that are more likely to result in a longer-term, more valuable customer.

01:53.480 --> 01:57.120
So another thing we're able to do differently than a traditional restaurant by leveraging

01:57.120 --> 02:02.200
data is that in a traditional restaurant, if something was wrong with your meal, you

02:02.200 --> 02:04.080
would say that to your server.

02:04.080 --> 02:08.200
They would maybe go back to the kitchen, have them modify it, tweak it, and then bring it

02:08.200 --> 02:11.640
back out, but that data wouldn't be getting captured anywhere.

02:11.640 --> 02:15.680
Well those types of errors are even more critical for us because our customer is not eating

02:15.680 --> 02:19.000
our food at the restaurant, they're eating it at their home or their workplace.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.760
And so what we've done is engineered systems that allow when we get issues through our

02:22.760 --> 02:27.960
customer experience team, we document, classify, and store all those, and our culinary team

02:27.960 --> 02:32.840
has custom data tools to look through all the different types of issues that are happening,

02:32.840 --> 02:37.640
what items have the most issues, which kitchens have the most issues, and how is that varying

02:37.640 --> 02:39.320
across items.

02:39.320 --> 02:43.840
So for example, if the Indianapolis kitchen is always nailing the Applewood chicken salad

02:43.840 --> 02:48.080
and the Columbus Ohio kitchen is always messing that up and has a high error rate, we can

02:48.080 --> 02:51.640
look at what are those two kitchens doing differently, and we can use this data to drive

02:51.640 --> 02:55.800
action and actually result in a better result for the customer.

02:55.800 --> 03:01.440
So that's another way we use data differently than a traditional restaurant.

03:01.440 --> 03:06.800
The other thing we can do is in a restaurant, you may have no traceability to a transaction.

03:06.800 --> 03:10.920
So if someone pays with cash or if they pay with card and then a different card next time,

03:10.920 --> 03:14.120
you don't really know how that customer is behaving over the long run.

03:14.120 --> 03:19.280
We use customer data because you always have to have a digital account to order a cluster

03:19.280 --> 03:20.520
truck.

03:20.520 --> 03:25.600
We can track lifetime value of customers and figure out where our most valuable customers

03:25.600 --> 03:31.480
are coming from and where they're getting delivery to, and then therefore push for traction

03:31.480 --> 03:36.480
in venues that are similar to where the most valuable customers are coming from, not just

03:36.480 --> 03:39.560
the most customers are coming from.

03:39.560 --> 03:43.400
Another way we use data to our advantage differently than a traditional restaurant.

03:43.400 --> 03:47.080
In a traditional restaurant, you walk in and they say, we're on a wait right now.

03:47.080 --> 03:49.120
It's going to be about 20 minutes.

03:49.120 --> 03:52.900
And they're doing this by essentially just looking at their wait list and kind of looking

03:52.900 --> 03:55.760
at their watch and making a guess.

03:55.760 --> 03:59.480
And most of the time, they're airing on the side of caution so that you'll be pleasantly

03:59.480 --> 04:01.760
surprised that your wait time was less than what it was.

04:01.760 --> 04:04.040
But you really don't know how long it's going to take.

04:04.040 --> 04:08.560
But when you come to Cluster Truck's website, you have no visual clue of how busy we are

04:08.560 --> 04:11.960
because you can't see a line out the door.

04:11.960 --> 04:15.720
You can't see the servers looking busy or anything like that.

04:15.720 --> 04:19.440
So what we do is we use machine learning to predict to you how long it will be if you

04:19.440 --> 04:23.120
were to place your order right now for your food to get delivered.

04:23.120 --> 04:26.960
And we're able to do this much better than our competitors like DoorDash and Grubhub

04:26.960 --> 04:28.500
because we're vertically integrated.

04:28.500 --> 04:34.000
We have insight into what everyone's cooking, how busy each station is, how many orders

04:34.000 --> 04:39.680
are being withheld until we have the driver bandwidth, and driver bandwidth or cook bandwidth

04:39.680 --> 04:41.240
to cook them.

04:41.240 --> 04:45.500
And so basically, we're able to leverage machine learning to predict our wait times with an

04:45.500 --> 04:48.260
average error of about four and a half minutes.

04:48.260 --> 04:53.740
So that's some of the ways that Cluster Truck leverages data to be different than traditional

04:53.740 --> 04:54.740
restaurants.

04:54.740 --> 04:58.580
And we're still just kind of at the beginning of understanding how powerful what we can

04:58.580 --> 05:04.900
do with the data what we have is, thanks.
