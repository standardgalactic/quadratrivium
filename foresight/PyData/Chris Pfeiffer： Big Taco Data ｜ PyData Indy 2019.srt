1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,180
I don't have any slides because I decided to talk like 18 minutes ago.

2
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:19,080
So my name is Chris Pfeiffer and I'm the head of data science at Cluster Truck.

3
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,200
And so I thought I'd use this as an opportunity to explain what makes us different from a

4
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:29,160
real restaurant and or a traditional restaurant and how we use data to our advantage.

5
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,600
So in a traditional restaurant, they have data that they call the PMix or the product

6
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,600
mix.

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,840
And this is the main thing driving their menu decisions.

8
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,720
And what this is is just how many of each item on their menu that they've sold each week.

9
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,800
And at Cluster Truck when we launched, it was important for us to have that same PMix so

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,640
that our chefs could look at that in the way that they're used to.

11
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,600
But we also are able to go much deeper since we're a vertically integrated digital-only

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,600
kitchen.

13
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,840
How many people have heard of Cluster Truck or tried Cluster?

14
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,520
OK, so Cluster Truck is basically a tech-enabled delivery-only kitchen.

15
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,000
So the main difference between us and someone like DoorDash or Grubhub is that we cook all

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,680
our own food and manage our own menu and are engineered 100% for delivery instead of basically

17
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,860
attaching digital ordering and delivery to existing restaurants.

18
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:26,360
So what we look at in addition to the traditional PMixes, for a certain item, if someone ordered

19
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,560
it for the first time, what percentage of the time do they come back and order Cluster

20
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,920
Truck again?

21
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,040
We also look at for a certain item, if somebody ordered that on their first order.

22
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,480
What percent of the time when they do order again, are they ordering that same item versus

23
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,920
something else?

24
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,480
And so we use this to optimize not only the most popular menu items, but the menu items

25
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:53,480
that are more likely to result in a longer-term, more valuable customer.

26
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,120
So another thing we're able to do differently than a traditional restaurant by leveraging

27
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:02,200
data is that in a traditional restaurant, if something was wrong with your meal, you

28
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,080
would say that to your server.

29
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,200
They would maybe go back to the kitchen, have them modify it, tweak it, and then bring it

30
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,640
back out, but that data wouldn't be getting captured anywhere.

31
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,680
Well those types of errors are even more critical for us because our customer is not eating

32
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,000
our food at the restaurant, they're eating it at their home or their workplace.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,760
And so what we've done is engineered systems that allow when we get issues through our

34
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,960
customer experience team, we document, classify, and store all those, and our culinary team

35
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,840
has custom data tools to look through all the different types of issues that are happening,

36
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,640
what items have the most issues, which kitchens have the most issues, and how is that varying

37
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,320
across items.

38
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,840
So for example, if the Indianapolis kitchen is always nailing the Applewood chicken salad

39
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,080
and the Columbus Ohio kitchen is always messing that up and has a high error rate, we can

40
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,640
look at what are those two kitchens doing differently, and we can use this data to drive

41
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,800
action and actually result in a better result for the customer.

42
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,440
So that's another way we use data differently than a traditional restaurant.

43
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,800
The other thing we can do is in a restaurant, you may have no traceability to a transaction.

44
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,920
So if someone pays with cash or if they pay with card and then a different card next time,

45
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,120
you don't really know how that customer is behaving over the long run.

46
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:19,280
We use customer data because you always have to have a digital account to order a cluster

47
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,520
truck.

48
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,600
We can track lifetime value of customers and figure out where our most valuable customers

49
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:31,480
are coming from and where they're getting delivery to, and then therefore push for traction

50
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:36,480
in venues that are similar to where the most valuable customers are coming from, not just

51
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,560
the most customers are coming from.

52
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,400
Another way we use data to our advantage differently than a traditional restaurant.

53
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,080
In a traditional restaurant, you walk in and they say, we're on a wait right now.

54
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,120
It's going to be about 20 minutes.

55
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,900
And they're doing this by essentially just looking at their wait list and kind of looking

56
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,760
at their watch and making a guess.

57
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,480
And most of the time, they're airing on the side of caution so that you'll be pleasantly

58
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,760
surprised that your wait time was less than what it was.

59
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,040
But you really don't know how long it's going to take.

60
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,560
But when you come to Cluster Truck's website, you have no visual clue of how busy we are

61
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,960
because you can't see a line out the door.

62
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,720
You can't see the servers looking busy or anything like that.

63
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,440
So what we do is we use machine learning to predict to you how long it will be if you

64
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,120
were to place your order right now for your food to get delivered.

65
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,960
And we're able to do this much better than our competitors like DoorDash and Grubhub

66
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,500
because we're vertically integrated.

67
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:34,000
We have insight into what everyone's cooking, how busy each station is, how many orders

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,680
are being withheld until we have the driver bandwidth, and driver bandwidth or cook bandwidth

69
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,240
to cook them.

70
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,500
And so basically, we're able to leverage machine learning to predict our wait times with an

71
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,260
average error of about four and a half minutes.

72
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:53,740
So that's some of the ways that Cluster Truck leverages data to be different than traditional

73
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,740
restaurants.

74
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,580
And we're still just kind of at the beginning of understanding how powerful what we can

75
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:04,900
do with the data what we have is, thanks.
