0	14180	I don't have any slides because I decided to talk like 18 minutes ago.
14180	19080	So my name is Chris Pfeiffer and I'm the head of data science at Cluster Truck.
19080	23200	And so I thought I'd use this as an opportunity to explain what makes us different from a
23200	29160	real restaurant and or a traditional restaurant and how we use data to our advantage.
29160	34600	So in a traditional restaurant, they have data that they call the PMix or the product
34600	35600	mix.
35600	37840	And this is the main thing driving their menu decisions.
37840	43720	And what this is is just how many of each item on their menu that they've sold each week.
43720	48800	And at Cluster Truck when we launched, it was important for us to have that same PMix so
48800	51640	that our chefs could look at that in the way that they're used to.
51640	56600	But we also are able to go much deeper since we're a vertically integrated digital-only
56600	57600	kitchen.
57840	60840	How many people have heard of Cluster Truck or tried Cluster?
60840	66520	OK, so Cluster Truck is basically a tech-enabled delivery-only kitchen.
66520	70000	So the main difference between us and someone like DoorDash or Grubhub is that we cook all
70000	75680	our own food and manage our own menu and are engineered 100% for delivery instead of basically
75680	79860	attaching digital ordering and delivery to existing restaurants.
79860	86360	So what we look at in addition to the traditional PMixes, for a certain item, if someone ordered
86560	90560	it for the first time, what percentage of the time do they come back and order Cluster
90560	91920	Truck again?
91920	96040	We also look at for a certain item, if somebody ordered that on their first order.
96040	100480	What percent of the time when they do order again, are they ordering that same item versus
100480	101920	something else?
101920	107480	And so we use this to optimize not only the most popular menu items, but the menu items
107480	113480	that are more likely to result in a longer-term, more valuable customer.
113480	117120	So another thing we're able to do differently than a traditional restaurant by leveraging
117120	122200	data is that in a traditional restaurant, if something was wrong with your meal, you
122200	124080	would say that to your server.
124080	128200	They would maybe go back to the kitchen, have them modify it, tweak it, and then bring it
128200	131640	back out, but that data wouldn't be getting captured anywhere.
131640	135680	Well those types of errors are even more critical for us because our customer is not eating
135680	139000	our food at the restaurant, they're eating it at their home or their workplace.
139000	142760	And so what we've done is engineered systems that allow when we get issues through our
142760	147960	customer experience team, we document, classify, and store all those, and our culinary team
147960	152840	has custom data tools to look through all the different types of issues that are happening,
152840	157640	what items have the most issues, which kitchens have the most issues, and how is that varying
157640	159320	across items.
159320	163840	So for example, if the Indianapolis kitchen is always nailing the Applewood chicken salad
163840	168080	and the Columbus Ohio kitchen is always messing that up and has a high error rate, we can
168080	171640	look at what are those two kitchens doing differently, and we can use this data to drive
171640	175800	action and actually result in a better result for the customer.
175800	181440	So that's another way we use data differently than a traditional restaurant.
181440	186800	The other thing we can do is in a restaurant, you may have no traceability to a transaction.
186800	190920	So if someone pays with cash or if they pay with card and then a different card next time,
190920	194120	you don't really know how that customer is behaving over the long run.
194120	199280	We use customer data because you always have to have a digital account to order a cluster
199280	200520	truck.
200520	205600	We can track lifetime value of customers and figure out where our most valuable customers
205600	211480	are coming from and where they're getting delivery to, and then therefore push for traction
211480	216480	in venues that are similar to where the most valuable customers are coming from, not just
216480	219560	the most customers are coming from.
219560	223400	Another way we use data to our advantage differently than a traditional restaurant.
223400	227080	In a traditional restaurant, you walk in and they say, we're on a wait right now.
227080	229120	It's going to be about 20 minutes.
229120	232900	And they're doing this by essentially just looking at their wait list and kind of looking
232900	235760	at their watch and making a guess.
235760	239480	And most of the time, they're airing on the side of caution so that you'll be pleasantly
239480	241760	surprised that your wait time was less than what it was.
241760	244040	But you really don't know how long it's going to take.
244040	248560	But when you come to Cluster Truck's website, you have no visual clue of how busy we are
248560	251960	because you can't see a line out the door.
251960	255720	You can't see the servers looking busy or anything like that.
255720	259440	So what we do is we use machine learning to predict to you how long it will be if you
259440	263120	were to place your order right now for your food to get delivered.
263120	266960	And we're able to do this much better than our competitors like DoorDash and Grubhub
266960	268500	because we're vertically integrated.
268500	274000	We have insight into what everyone's cooking, how busy each station is, how many orders
274000	279680	are being withheld until we have the driver bandwidth, and driver bandwidth or cook bandwidth
279680	281240	to cook them.
281240	285500	And so basically, we're able to leverage machine learning to predict our wait times with an
285500	288260	average error of about four and a half minutes.
288260	293740	So that's some of the ways that Cluster Truck leverages data to be different than traditional
293740	294740	restaurants.
294740	298580	And we're still just kind of at the beginning of understanding how powerful what we can
298580	304900	do with the data what we have is, thanks.
