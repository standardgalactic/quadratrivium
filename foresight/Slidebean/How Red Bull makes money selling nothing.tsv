0	2440	All right, Jose, what's going on here today, man?
2440	3760	I'm jumping off a plane.
3760	4680	Jumping out of a plane?
4680	5720	What are you, crazy?
5720	7080	Can I do this?
7080	8360	No.
8360	12800	Yep, that's me, paying $250 to jump out of a plane
12800	14000	just for the thrill of it.
14000	17720	I loved it for a moment, even though it doesn't look like it.
17720	20240	Kind of like this guy.
20240	23600	I felt I was flying or just a lot of wind in my face.
23600	30960	But of course, Red Bull didn't sponsor me back then.
30960	31960	I wish I had.
31960	34960	Red Bull sells 7.5 billion cans a year.
34960	39600	That's close to one can per person in the world, because people are hooked up on this
39600	46600	stuff and you see their logo everywhere.
46600	49640	But this is nothing compared to Coca-Cola.
49640	53400	Coca-Cola sells almost 2 billion units a day.
53400	55960	So how does Red Bull afford all of this?
55960	64480	That's a company-francics story.
64480	68840	All accounts agree that it was hot as hell when this guy called Dietrich Mattesich landed
68840	74840	in Bangkok in 1982.
74840	79400	He was exhausted, jet-lagged, but had to meet with a local distributor called Chalio Yovit.
79400	81640	I tried really hard to get the names right this time.
81640	82640	I hope I did.
82720	88800	Yovit saw this Austrian dude struggling, so he offered him a specially brewed tonic.
88800	91280	Not just any tonic, his own recipe.
91280	93000	Mattesich drank it and it was instant.
93000	95600	It was one drink and suddenly the jet-lag was gone.
95600	100120	Mattesich was hooked like an addict on heroin or someone on Red Bull.
100120	104000	Every time he visited Thailand, he told his driver to stop at a store and get some cratting
104000	105000	down.
105000	109480	Whatever this miracle beverage was, he loved it and he was not the only one.
109480	115600	You see, blue-collar workers, farmers, drivers, everybody on Thailand was drinking this thing.
115600	116960	And it wasn't by chance.
116960	120080	Chalio Yovit was a marketing genius.
120080	125480	Tonics and these types of specialty drinks, they've been popular in Asia for some time.
125480	126920	Some of them are sold as medicine.
126920	128800	And Thailand was no exception to this rule.
128800	132760	They were drinking these Japanese and these Korean brands, but they were expensive.
132760	134960	So blue-collar workers couldn't really afford them.
134960	138320	But Yovit felt that they were the ones who needed it most.
138320	142600	So he analyzed the existing beverages, looked at the ingredient list, and then he realized
142600	145480	that he could create a recipe of his own.
145480	148520	After all, he had been working in pharmaceuticals before.
148520	151520	And we are going to talk about the ingredients, but later.
151520	154240	Because in the 70s, Yovit had created this tonic.
154240	157920	The bottle had two impulse-in-balls ramming against each other with a yellow sun in the
157920	158920	background.
158920	160880	And he had made sure that it was cheap.
160880	163000	He had a tough upbringing as a dog farmer.
163000	168440	So his audience was people like him, laborers, workers, and drivers, factory workers.
168440	170720	And Krattingdang was a success.
170720	175000	In less than two years, people all over Thailand were drinking it just to get through the day.
175000	178520	And then, Yovit started sponsoring Muay Thai tournaments.
178520	182080	So these are absolutely essential to Thai culture.
182080	186720	And he cemented his drink as a must-have at these events.
186720	191200	So by this time, Matisich had tried it, Krattingdang had proved its worth.
191200	196280	So the Austrian salesman did some research, found out that at the time, the largest taxpayer
196280	201400	in Japan was an energy drink company.
201400	204640	So there was potential for global scale.
204640	207000	Matisich approached Yovit with an offer.
207000	210320	Let's take this Krattingdang to Europe.
210320	215120	Then fast forward to now.
215120	217320	For many, it's just more than a drink.
217320	218320	It's an icon.
218320	221120	And that's all Matisich's work.
222040	232040	But judging by what we see today, you could imagine that it would be the biggest challenge.
232040	235240	Nowadays, Europe is one of Red Bull's hotspots.
235240	240360	For example, in 2020, Red Bull grew the most in Turkey, in Germany, in Scandinavia, in
240360	242240	Russia, and in Switzerland.
242240	246160	And much more than that, the brand had cemented its name in global sports.
246160	248160	Look at Formula One or even football.
248160	249160	Soccer.
249200	252600	No wonder Europe loves Red Bull, but it wasn't always like this.
252600	254840	Red Bull was an idea at the beginning.
254840	259040	It was kind of like a paradox, because the beverage was more expensive than Coca-Cola.
259040	262840	It came in a smaller can, and it tasted weird.
262840	264280	But it gave us energy.
264280	266520	Nothing about Red Bull was making a lot of sense.
266520	270180	So when Matisich tried to sell the idea to European investors, he ran into this brick
270180	272400	wall because nobody wanted it.
272400	275560	But he believed this Krattingdang made sense.
275560	280480	So he convinced Yovitia for both of them to put $500,000 with the remaining 2% going
280480	281480	to Yovitia's son.
281480	285840	And they would take the brand to Europe themselves, but not before some changes.
285840	288720	The flavor and the desired effects didn't have to change.
288720	292160	On that side, everything was great, but the rest wasn't.
292160	295400	Of course, we're going to start with the name, which I am probably butchering by now,
295400	299400	Krattingdang, because that would not click in the European market.
299400	301520	But its meaning was significant.
301520	302520	But let's pause here for a second.
302520	305880	I need to talk about our sponsor for this video, which is Chartmogle, because tracking
305880	308280	your SaaS metrics is absolutely vital.
308280	313960	If you don't do it right, you might run into trouble, and we have, and we almost died because
313960	314960	of it.
314960	318600	And for years, we've been using Chartmogle to make sure that these numbers are accurate.
318600	322560	So we generate revenue from a lot of sources from SaaS, to this YouTube channel, to our
322560	326200	consulting branch, and we consolidate all of that in their platform.
326200	329840	But for SaaS specifically, which is their focus, they let you run cohort tables and
329840	334120	lifetime value reports and filter customer sources and how they perform with their lifetime
334120	335120	values.
335120	339240	You can use tags to see customers from specific regions and how well they pay.
339240	343160	And for companies under $10,000, Chartmogle is absolutely free to sign up.

351840	355400	Thanks again to our friends at Chartmogle for sponsoring today's video.
355400	357320	So let's get back to this retro story.
357320	362320	When Yuvidya created his product, he needed a name that appealed to Thai culture.
362320	366000	And all that he could think of was one thing, the garb.
366000	370440	So native to Southeast Asia, this garb animal is big.
370440	374720	Some can reach seven feet in height at the shoulder and weight up to 3,000 pounds.
374720	379360	So these are massive dudes and they epitomize hard work and strength.
379360	382480	So it was an ideal match for a beverage for the working class.
382480	387040	So that's how he came up with this two bowls butting heads with a yellow sign in the background.
387080	389640	Okay, so now we are going to talk about ingredients.
389640	393880	Because Yuvidya realized that almost all of these tonics had the same core group of ingredients.
393880	396680	Caffeine, sucrose, glucose, and taurine.
396680	401360	All Yuvidya did was make a specific recipe and add some flavor to it.
401360	402880	That was honestly it.
402880	407480	The recipe for the original Red Bull to this day remains unchanged.
407480	412240	However, in some markets, it's caffeine content that changes and you're going to see why in a sec.
412240	416080	Because that's where things get very controversial for better or worse.
416080	419440	But first, let's talk about this other ingredient called taurine.
419440	421760	And I need to get this out of the way quickly.
421760	423400	It's not bull sperm.
423400	425720	They put real bull sperm in Red Bull.
425720	426640	Seaman.
427840	430400	There's this, I mean, if you don't know what I'm talking about.
430400	437560	Since 2016, there's this myth on social networks, social media that says that taurine in Red Bull comes from bull sperm.
437560	438240	It doesn't.
438240	442200	Taurine is this sulfuric amino acid that's actually found in humans.
442200	442600	We have it.
442600	445440	We have it in our retinas and our brain and our heart and our blood.
445440	448680	And we get it from meat, we get it from fish and some other animal products.
448680	452880	So taurine comes from the Latin taurus, which means ox or bull.
452880	457120	And the first extraction of taurine came from ox bile in 1827.
457120	461440	Nowadays, Red Bull gets its story from just the pharmaceutical company that manufactures it.
461440	463920	So no, it's not, it's not sperm.
463920	464720	But back to the point.
464720	466880	Taurine is an anti-inflammatory.
466880	469920	Plus, there are suggestions that it can help with conditions like epilepsy.
469920	475760	Now that, of course, is not Red Bull's goal or any other drink, any other energy drink for that matter.
475760	479360	But taurine is an energy drinks, honestly, because of tradition.
479360	483760	People believed that taurine helped improve athletic and mental performance.
483760	488400	But regardless, taurine was controversial enough for countries to ban Red Bull altogether.
488400	492720	Red Bull Cola, the popular caffeine drink, has been banned in Germany this morning.
492720	496960	Heart attacks, strokes, respiratory illness, I mean, all kinds of things.
496960	498600	That's the very fascinating part.
498600	503240	There's not enough evidence to prove that taurine in Red Bull is harmful.
503240	505800	But there isn't enough to prove that it works.
505800	507960	It's like the supplements, right?
507960	513880	Anyway, in 2008, France dropped the ban as it could not officially prove that taurine was harmful.
513880	517720	And the weird thing is that the ingredients list isn't controversial in Asia at all.
517720	521160	But in Europe and the US, Red Bull has this bad reputation.
521160	524280	Many say that it's dangerous for your health and can even cause death.
524280	526920	And a lot of that focus is on the taurine.
526920	529720	But let's not forget about the other ingredient, which is the caffeine.
529720	531800	Now, of course, caffeine is addictive.
534760	537480	But the good thing about caffeine is that it doesn't affect your
537480	540360	economical, social, physical health like other drugs do.
541400	542920	You can get hooked on it, yes.
542920	544360	But let's look at the numbers.
544360	547320	And for this, let's look at an original Red Bull can.
557720	567080	So Red Bull has as much or more sugar than Coca-Cola, has a lot of caffeine,
567080	568760	plus the controversial taurine.
568760	572040	No wonder it gives you wings, or you end up in the hospital.
572040	575480	In some cases, they drank eight or more cans in a row.
576120	582120	That is about a cup and a half of sugar and 1.5 the daily recommended dosage of caffeine.
582120	584600	So when it comes to partying, it's even worse.
584600	587320	Ever since the 80s, people have mixed Red Bull with alcohol.
587320	592360	And that we can agree that it's not healthy at all, even though it's kind of delicious.
592360	596200	And believe it or not, carbonation has a lot to do with it.
596200	601240	If you go to Thailand and try cretin, dang, and you'd see that there's no carbonation.
601240	603560	This wasn't a thing in tonics back then.
603560	608040	And Matt Desich knew that Europeans would absolutely prefer that.
608040	610760	So that's how the world became addicted to Red Bull.
610760	616360	Almost, because people enjoyed the beverage, but Matt Desich was going to take things further.
616360	619400	Sure, cretin dang was aimed at workers, but Matt Desich had other ideas.
619400	622680	When the brand launched in 87, he made it exotic.
622680	625560	The can, the visuals, the prize, it was more expensive.
625560	626760	It was aimed at the elite.
626760	632040	And the sense of adventure wasn't in anyone's mind when they were drinking cretin dang in Thailand.
632040	633720	They just needed to stay awake.
633720	634920	In Europe, why not?
634920	637480	Why not aim at the wealthy adventurers?
637480	640440	And for this, Matt Desich had a clear strategy.
640440	645000	He targeted parties and skiers and clubbers and wealthy students.
645000	648200	Why? Because they don't want a boring cup of coffee.
648200	652920	He also paid popular university students to host parties and just give out Red Bulls.
652920	657080	Matt Desich even started pimping out some of their cars with Red Bull logos.
657080	659800	And that's how the famous Red Bull Mini Cooper was born.
659800	663720	It was an effective grassroots campaign that worked to perfection.
663720	669320	In the first year of existence, Red Bull sold 1 million cans, but Matt Desich wasn't satisfied.
669320	672520	Red Bull had to become a cultural phenomenon.
672520	677240	It had to be a conversation that transcended beverage and that blew people away.
677240	680440	And that's where extreme sports finally came into the picture.
683800	687080	In 1989, he partnered with Gerard Bergen, racecar driver.
687080	690840	And it was a small effort, a brand sponsoring a driver, not even a team.
690840	692840	But after that, Red Bull didn't stop.
692840	696520	Red Bull was sponsoring everything from BMX to skiing,
696520	699320	from mountain biking to the Dakar Rally.
699320	700520	And then there's this stuff.
700520	706200	And in this stuff, within each sport, Red Bull made sure that they were the ones who stood out.
706200	712120	Every time Red Bull sponsored something, it was an all-out party and some Red Bull to hand out.
712120	717000	Even if this recipe was successful, Matt Desich knew that partying wasn't for everyone.
717000	722440	So as the brand gained even more momentum, so did the scope of sports under the Red Bull name.
722440	728200	The company leaped from allying with one driver to sponsoring a whole Formula One team.
730280	731960	And then he aimed at football.
731960	735400	Red Bull has teams in Austria, the MLS, and the German Bundesliga.
735400	737320	Most of these have had great success.
737320	739480	And that's actually part of the magic.
739480	743640	Red Bull was into ice hockey, drifting, motorcycle racing, and then
746600	749880	Matt Desich took a man to the edge of space and had him jump.
750840	752440	Why? Because they could afford it.
752440	753800	It's more than fanfare.
753800	758200	Every year, the brand becomes more successful, further fueling its expansion.
758200	760520	But let's talk about Formula One for a sec.
760520	764520	Red Bull purchased, acquired, the failing Jaguar team for a dollar.
764520	767800	But Matt Desich promised to invest $400 million dollars.
767800	771320	By 2018, the team was worth $640 million.
771320	774840	And by 2021, it had won the championship five times.
774840	777000	This is all part of Matt Desich's strategy.
777000	779720	And no, 2021 isn't very controversial.
779720	782760	But after all, Red Bull won.
782760	786920	Their recipe for Formula One success is the topic of conversation.
786920	790520	Because a lot of the money does come from selling just Red Bull cans.
790520	793720	But they also make money from prizes and sponsorships and
794360	797320	more things associated to Formula One.
797320	800280	By the way, we have never talked about Formula One,
800280	802280	but we're happy to if you want us to make a video.
802280	803560	So let us know in the comments.
803560	805560	And then, of course, we have the standalone projects.
805560	810360	That includes spending $30 million to send Baumgarten to the edge of space and back.
810360	813800	A lot of money for sure, but a one-minute video on Red Bull's YouTube
813800	815640	has 47 million views.
815640	817080	What better promotion than that?
817080	821240	It's estimated that in the six months after the jump, sales increased 7%
821240	823160	and global sales 13%.
823160	825240	That's just genius marketing.
825240	827960	In the end, Red Bull is not about beverages.
827960	829080	It's a marketing company.
829080	830840	And it's excellent at it.
830840	833560	Take the German football team, the RB Lebsich.
833560	837560	In 2009, Red Bull purchased the rights to play in the fifth division.
837560	839160	Fifth, they renamed the team.
839160	841080	They invested millions of dollars in it.
841080	843560	And then in 2019, they classified to the Champions League.
844360	848360	Today, this team is worth 500 million euro.
848360	852200	And get this, they don't produce anything, not even the drinks.
852200	855880	That's the job of TC Pharmaceuticals back in old Thailand.
855880	857960	It produces the original concentrate,
857960	860840	and then other outsourced factories just make the different flavors.
860840	863240	Now, there's something maybe about to change,
863240	867800	because this not producing anything model might be about to disappear.
867800	871800	Because rumors say that Red Bull Formula One racing plans to take full responsibility
871800	875960	for manufacturing, producing Formula One engines in 2023.
875960	880920	So this thing began as a drink and now makes performance car engines.
880920	885640	But as for the rest of the products, Red Bull doesn't make the clothing or any goods they sell.
885640	890680	Instead, they just focus on making sure the world sees, hears,
890680	893640	and breathes Red Bull everywhere.
893640	895640	And this applies to the factory even.
895640	903160	Sarvodya Vidya says that 95% of employees don't drink Red Bull when they enter the company.
903160	905800	But once they're in, they just get hooked on it.
905800	909000	So it started with this addicting beverage,
909000	912440	but Mattesic knew that it was not going to end there.
912440	914760	And now the world loves this stuff.
914760	916920	Again, 171 countries.
916920	919480	It dominates the energy drink market.
919560	924520	And of course you have competitors, but we're talking about 7.5 billion cans in a year.
924520	930360	We millennials live at a pace that where we need some extra fuel to get through the day.
930360	932840	So it's at least for us, it's no longer just about the party,
