WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.440
All right, Jose, what's going on here today, man?

00:02.440 --> 00:03.760
I'm jumping off a plane.

00:03.760 --> 00:04.680
Jumping out of a plane?

00:04.680 --> 00:05.720
What are you, crazy?

00:05.720 --> 00:07.080
Can I do this?

00:07.080 --> 00:08.360
No.

00:08.360 --> 00:12.800
Yep, that's me, paying $250 to jump out of a plane

00:12.800 --> 00:14.000
just for the thrill of it.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.720
I loved it for a moment, even though it doesn't look like it.

00:17.720 --> 00:20.240
Kind of like this guy.

00:20.240 --> 00:23.600
I felt I was flying or just a lot of wind in my face.

00:23.600 --> 00:30.960
But of course, Red Bull didn't sponsor me back then.

00:30.960 --> 00:31.960
I wish I had.

00:31.960 --> 00:34.960
Red Bull sells 7.5 billion cans a year.

00:34.960 --> 00:39.600
That's close to one can per person in the world, because people are hooked up on this

00:39.600 --> 00:46.600
stuff and you see their logo everywhere.

00:46.600 --> 00:49.640
But this is nothing compared to Coca-Cola.

00:49.640 --> 00:53.400
Coca-Cola sells almost 2 billion units a day.

00:53.400 --> 00:55.960
So how does Red Bull afford all of this?

00:55.960 --> 01:04.480
That's a company-francics story.

01:04.480 --> 01:08.840
All accounts agree that it was hot as hell when this guy called Dietrich Mattesich landed

01:08.840 --> 01:14.840
in Bangkok in 1982.

01:14.840 --> 01:19.400
He was exhausted, jet-lagged, but had to meet with a local distributor called Chalio Yovit.

01:19.400 --> 01:21.640
I tried really hard to get the names right this time.

01:21.640 --> 01:22.640
I hope I did.

01:22.720 --> 01:28.800
Yovit saw this Austrian dude struggling, so he offered him a specially brewed tonic.

01:28.800 --> 01:31.280
Not just any tonic, his own recipe.

01:31.280 --> 01:33.000
Mattesich drank it and it was instant.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.600
It was one drink and suddenly the jet-lag was gone.

01:35.600 --> 01:40.120
Mattesich was hooked like an addict on heroin or someone on Red Bull.

01:40.120 --> 01:44.000
Every time he visited Thailand, he told his driver to stop at a store and get some cratting

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
down.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.480
Whatever this miracle beverage was, he loved it and he was not the only one.

01:49.480 --> 01:55.600
You see, blue-collar workers, farmers, drivers, everybody on Thailand was drinking this thing.

01:55.600 --> 01:56.960
And it wasn't by chance.

01:56.960 --> 02:00.080
Chalio Yovit was a marketing genius.

02:00.080 --> 02:05.480
Tonics and these types of specialty drinks, they've been popular in Asia for some time.

02:05.480 --> 02:06.920
Some of them are sold as medicine.

02:06.920 --> 02:08.800
And Thailand was no exception to this rule.

02:08.800 --> 02:12.760
They were drinking these Japanese and these Korean brands, but they were expensive.

02:12.760 --> 02:14.960
So blue-collar workers couldn't really afford them.

02:14.960 --> 02:18.320
But Yovit felt that they were the ones who needed it most.

02:18.320 --> 02:22.600
So he analyzed the existing beverages, looked at the ingredient list, and then he realized

02:22.600 --> 02:25.480
that he could create a recipe of his own.

02:25.480 --> 02:28.520
After all, he had been working in pharmaceuticals before.

02:28.520 --> 02:31.520
And we are going to talk about the ingredients, but later.

02:31.520 --> 02:34.240
Because in the 70s, Yovit had created this tonic.

02:34.240 --> 02:37.920
The bottle had two impulse-in-balls ramming against each other with a yellow sun in the

02:37.920 --> 02:38.920
background.

02:38.920 --> 02:40.880
And he had made sure that it was cheap.

02:40.880 --> 02:43.000
He had a tough upbringing as a dog farmer.

02:43.000 --> 02:48.440
So his audience was people like him, laborers, workers, and drivers, factory workers.

02:48.440 --> 02:50.720
And Krattingdang was a success.

02:50.720 --> 02:55.000
In less than two years, people all over Thailand were drinking it just to get through the day.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.520
And then, Yovit started sponsoring Muay Thai tournaments.

02:58.520 --> 03:02.080
So these are absolutely essential to Thai culture.

03:02.080 --> 03:06.720
And he cemented his drink as a must-have at these events.

03:06.720 --> 03:11.200
So by this time, Matisich had tried it, Krattingdang had proved its worth.

03:11.200 --> 03:16.280
So the Austrian salesman did some research, found out that at the time, the largest taxpayer

03:16.280 --> 03:21.400
in Japan was an energy drink company.

03:21.400 --> 03:24.640
So there was potential for global scale.

03:24.640 --> 03:27.000
Matisich approached Yovit with an offer.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.320
Let's take this Krattingdang to Europe.

03:30.320 --> 03:35.120
Then fast forward to now.

03:35.120 --> 03:37.320
For many, it's just more than a drink.

03:37.320 --> 03:38.320
It's an icon.

03:38.320 --> 03:41.120
And that's all Matisich's work.

03:42.040 --> 03:52.040
But judging by what we see today, you could imagine that it would be the biggest challenge.

03:52.040 --> 03:55.240
Nowadays, Europe is one of Red Bull's hotspots.

03:55.240 --> 04:00.360
For example, in 2020, Red Bull grew the most in Turkey, in Germany, in Scandinavia, in

04:00.360 --> 04:02.240
Russia, and in Switzerland.

04:02.240 --> 04:06.160
And much more than that, the brand had cemented its name in global sports.

04:06.160 --> 04:08.160
Look at Formula One or even football.

04:08.160 --> 04:09.160
Soccer.

04:09.200 --> 04:12.600
No wonder Europe loves Red Bull, but it wasn't always like this.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.840
Red Bull was an idea at the beginning.

04:14.840 --> 04:19.040
It was kind of like a paradox, because the beverage was more expensive than Coca-Cola.

04:19.040 --> 04:22.840
It came in a smaller can, and it tasted weird.

04:22.840 --> 04:24.280
But it gave us energy.

04:24.280 --> 04:26.520
Nothing about Red Bull was making a lot of sense.

04:26.520 --> 04:30.180
So when Matisich tried to sell the idea to European investors, he ran into this brick

04:30.180 --> 04:32.400
wall because nobody wanted it.

04:32.400 --> 04:35.560
But he believed this Krattingdang made sense.

04:35.560 --> 04:40.480
So he convinced Yovitia for both of them to put $500,000 with the remaining 2% going

04:40.480 --> 04:41.480
to Yovitia's son.

04:41.480 --> 04:45.840
And they would take the brand to Europe themselves, but not before some changes.

04:45.840 --> 04:48.720
The flavor and the desired effects didn't have to change.

04:48.720 --> 04:52.160
On that side, everything was great, but the rest wasn't.

04:52.160 --> 04:55.400
Of course, we're going to start with the name, which I am probably butchering by now,

04:55.400 --> 04:59.400
Krattingdang, because that would not click in the European market.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.520
But its meaning was significant.

05:01.520 --> 05:02.520
But let's pause here for a second.

05:02.520 --> 05:05.880
I need to talk about our sponsor for this video, which is Chartmogle, because tracking

05:05.880 --> 05:08.280
your SaaS metrics is absolutely vital.

05:08.280 --> 05:13.960
If you don't do it right, you might run into trouble, and we have, and we almost died because

05:13.960 --> 05:14.960
of it.

05:14.960 --> 05:18.600
And for years, we've been using Chartmogle to make sure that these numbers are accurate.

05:18.600 --> 05:22.560
So we generate revenue from a lot of sources from SaaS, to this YouTube channel, to our

05:22.560 --> 05:26.200
consulting branch, and we consolidate all of that in their platform.

05:26.200 --> 05:29.840
But for SaaS specifically, which is their focus, they let you run cohort tables and

05:29.840 --> 05:34.120
lifetime value reports and filter customer sources and how they perform with their lifetime

05:34.120 --> 05:35.120
values.

05:35.120 --> 05:39.240
You can use tags to see customers from specific regions and how well they pay.

05:39.240 --> 05:43.160
And for companies under $10,000, Chartmogle is absolutely free to sign up.

05:43.160 --> 05:47.200
You can use the link chartmogle.com slash Slypebean, and if you have over $10,000 in

05:47.200 --> 05:51.840
monthly subscriptions, you can write off $600 from your first year if you use the code Slypebean.

05:51.840 --> 05:55.400
Thanks again to our friends at Chartmogle for sponsoring today's video.

05:55.400 --> 05:57.320
So let's get back to this retro story.

05:57.320 --> 06:02.320
When Yuvidya created his product, he needed a name that appealed to Thai culture.

06:02.320 --> 06:06.000
And all that he could think of was one thing, the garb.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.440
So native to Southeast Asia, this garb animal is big.

06:10.440 --> 06:14.720
Some can reach seven feet in height at the shoulder and weight up to 3,000 pounds.

06:14.720 --> 06:19.360
So these are massive dudes and they epitomize hard work and strength.

06:19.360 --> 06:22.480
So it was an ideal match for a beverage for the working class.

06:22.480 --> 06:27.040
So that's how he came up with this two bowls butting heads with a yellow sign in the background.

06:27.080 --> 06:29.640
Okay, so now we are going to talk about ingredients.

06:29.640 --> 06:33.880
Because Yuvidya realized that almost all of these tonics had the same core group of ingredients.

06:33.880 --> 06:36.680
Caffeine, sucrose, glucose, and taurine.

06:36.680 --> 06:41.360
All Yuvidya did was make a specific recipe and add some flavor to it.

06:41.360 --> 06:42.880
That was honestly it.

06:42.880 --> 06:47.480
The recipe for the original Red Bull to this day remains unchanged.

06:47.480 --> 06:52.240
However, in some markets, it's caffeine content that changes and you're going to see why in a sec.

06:52.240 --> 06:56.080
Because that's where things get very controversial for better or worse.

06:56.080 --> 06:59.440
But first, let's talk about this other ingredient called taurine.

06:59.440 --> 07:01.760
And I need to get this out of the way quickly.

07:01.760 --> 07:03.400
It's not bull sperm.

07:03.400 --> 07:05.720
They put real bull sperm in Red Bull.

07:05.720 --> 07:06.640
Seaman.

07:07.840 --> 07:10.400
There's this, I mean, if you don't know what I'm talking about.

07:10.400 --> 07:17.560
Since 2016, there's this myth on social networks, social media that says that taurine in Red Bull comes from bull sperm.

07:17.560 --> 07:18.240
It doesn't.

07:18.240 --> 07:22.200
Taurine is this sulfuric amino acid that's actually found in humans.

07:22.200 --> 07:22.600
We have it.

07:22.600 --> 07:25.440
We have it in our retinas and our brain and our heart and our blood.

07:25.440 --> 07:28.680
And we get it from meat, we get it from fish and some other animal products.

07:28.680 --> 07:32.880
So taurine comes from the Latin taurus, which means ox or bull.

07:32.880 --> 07:37.120
And the first extraction of taurine came from ox bile in 1827.

07:37.120 --> 07:41.440
Nowadays, Red Bull gets its story from just the pharmaceutical company that manufactures it.

07:41.440 --> 07:43.920
So no, it's not, it's not sperm.

07:43.920 --> 07:44.720
But back to the point.

07:44.720 --> 07:46.880
Taurine is an anti-inflammatory.

07:46.880 --> 07:49.920
Plus, there are suggestions that it can help with conditions like epilepsy.

07:49.920 --> 07:55.760
Now that, of course, is not Red Bull's goal or any other drink, any other energy drink for that matter.

07:55.760 --> 07:59.360
But taurine is an energy drinks, honestly, because of tradition.

07:59.360 --> 08:03.760
People believed that taurine helped improve athletic and mental performance.

08:03.760 --> 08:08.400
But regardless, taurine was controversial enough for countries to ban Red Bull altogether.

08:08.400 --> 08:12.720
Red Bull Cola, the popular caffeine drink, has been banned in Germany this morning.

08:12.720 --> 08:16.960
Heart attacks, strokes, respiratory illness, I mean, all kinds of things.

08:16.960 --> 08:18.600
That's the very fascinating part.

08:18.600 --> 08:23.240
There's not enough evidence to prove that taurine in Red Bull is harmful.

08:23.240 --> 08:25.800
But there isn't enough to prove that it works.

08:25.800 --> 08:27.960
It's like the supplements, right?

08:27.960 --> 08:33.880
Anyway, in 2008, France dropped the ban as it could not officially prove that taurine was harmful.

08:33.880 --> 08:37.720
And the weird thing is that the ingredients list isn't controversial in Asia at all.

08:37.720 --> 08:41.160
But in Europe and the US, Red Bull has this bad reputation.

08:41.160 --> 08:44.280
Many say that it's dangerous for your health and can even cause death.

08:44.280 --> 08:46.920
And a lot of that focus is on the taurine.

08:46.920 --> 08:49.720
But let's not forget about the other ingredient, which is the caffeine.

08:49.720 --> 08:51.800
Now, of course, caffeine is addictive.

08:54.760 --> 08:57.480
But the good thing about caffeine is that it doesn't affect your

08:57.480 --> 09:00.360
economical, social, physical health like other drugs do.

09:01.400 --> 09:02.920
You can get hooked on it, yes.

09:02.920 --> 09:04.360
But let's look at the numbers.

09:04.360 --> 09:07.320
And for this, let's look at an original Red Bull can.

09:17.720 --> 09:27.080
So Red Bull has as much or more sugar than Coca-Cola, has a lot of caffeine,

09:27.080 --> 09:28.760
plus the controversial taurine.

09:28.760 --> 09:32.040
No wonder it gives you wings, or you end up in the hospital.

09:32.040 --> 09:35.480
In some cases, they drank eight or more cans in a row.

09:36.120 --> 09:42.120
That is about a cup and a half of sugar and 1.5 the daily recommended dosage of caffeine.

09:42.120 --> 09:44.600
So when it comes to partying, it's even worse.

09:44.600 --> 09:47.320
Ever since the 80s, people have mixed Red Bull with alcohol.

09:47.320 --> 09:52.360
And that we can agree that it's not healthy at all, even though it's kind of delicious.

09:52.360 --> 09:56.200
And believe it or not, carbonation has a lot to do with it.

09:56.200 --> 10:01.240
If you go to Thailand and try cretin, dang, and you'd see that there's no carbonation.

10:01.240 --> 10:03.560
This wasn't a thing in tonics back then.

10:03.560 --> 10:08.040
And Matt Desich knew that Europeans would absolutely prefer that.

10:08.040 --> 10:10.760
So that's how the world became addicted to Red Bull.

10:10.760 --> 10:16.360
Almost, because people enjoyed the beverage, but Matt Desich was going to take things further.

10:16.360 --> 10:19.400
Sure, cretin dang was aimed at workers, but Matt Desich had other ideas.

10:19.400 --> 10:22.680
When the brand launched in 87, he made it exotic.

10:22.680 --> 10:25.560
The can, the visuals, the prize, it was more expensive.

10:25.560 --> 10:26.760
It was aimed at the elite.

10:26.760 --> 10:32.040
And the sense of adventure wasn't in anyone's mind when they were drinking cretin dang in Thailand.

10:32.040 --> 10:33.720
They just needed to stay awake.

10:33.720 --> 10:34.920
In Europe, why not?

10:34.920 --> 10:37.480
Why not aim at the wealthy adventurers?

10:37.480 --> 10:40.440
And for this, Matt Desich had a clear strategy.

10:40.440 --> 10:45.000
He targeted parties and skiers and clubbers and wealthy students.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.200
Why? Because they don't want a boring cup of coffee.

10:48.200 --> 10:52.920
He also paid popular university students to host parties and just give out Red Bulls.

10:52.920 --> 10:57.080
Matt Desich even started pimping out some of their cars with Red Bull logos.

10:57.080 --> 10:59.800
And that's how the famous Red Bull Mini Cooper was born.

10:59.800 --> 11:03.720
It was an effective grassroots campaign that worked to perfection.

11:03.720 --> 11:09.320
In the first year of existence, Red Bull sold 1 million cans, but Matt Desich wasn't satisfied.

11:09.320 --> 11:12.520
Red Bull had to become a cultural phenomenon.

11:12.520 --> 11:17.240
It had to be a conversation that transcended beverage and that blew people away.

11:17.240 --> 11:20.440
And that's where extreme sports finally came into the picture.

11:23.800 --> 11:27.080
In 1989, he partnered with Gerard Bergen, racecar driver.

11:27.080 --> 11:30.840
And it was a small effort, a brand sponsoring a driver, not even a team.

11:30.840 --> 11:32.840
But after that, Red Bull didn't stop.

11:32.840 --> 11:36.520
Red Bull was sponsoring everything from BMX to skiing,

11:36.520 --> 11:39.320
from mountain biking to the Dakar Rally.

11:39.320 --> 11:40.520
And then there's this stuff.

11:40.520 --> 11:46.200
And in this stuff, within each sport, Red Bull made sure that they were the ones who stood out.

11:46.200 --> 11:52.120
Every time Red Bull sponsored something, it was an all-out party and some Red Bull to hand out.

11:52.120 --> 11:57.000
Even if this recipe was successful, Matt Desich knew that partying wasn't for everyone.

11:57.000 --> 12:02.440
So as the brand gained even more momentum, so did the scope of sports under the Red Bull name.

12:02.440 --> 12:08.200
The company leaped from allying with one driver to sponsoring a whole Formula One team.

12:10.280 --> 12:11.960
And then he aimed at football.

12:11.960 --> 12:15.400
Red Bull has teams in Austria, the MLS, and the German Bundesliga.

12:15.400 --> 12:17.320
Most of these have had great success.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.480
And that's actually part of the magic.

12:19.480 --> 12:23.640
Red Bull was into ice hockey, drifting, motorcycle racing, and then

12:26.600 --> 12:29.880
Matt Desich took a man to the edge of space and had him jump.

12:30.840 --> 12:32.440
Why? Because they could afford it.

12:32.440 --> 12:33.800
It's more than fanfare.

12:33.800 --> 12:38.200
Every year, the brand becomes more successful, further fueling its expansion.

12:38.200 --> 12:40.520
But let's talk about Formula One for a sec.

12:40.520 --> 12:44.520
Red Bull purchased, acquired, the failing Jaguar team for a dollar.

12:44.520 --> 12:47.800
But Matt Desich promised to invest $400 million dollars.

12:47.800 --> 12:51.320
By 2018, the team was worth $640 million.

12:51.320 --> 12:54.840
And by 2021, it had won the championship five times.

12:54.840 --> 12:57.000
This is all part of Matt Desich's strategy.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.720
And no, 2021 isn't very controversial.

12:59.720 --> 13:02.760
But after all, Red Bull won.

13:02.760 --> 13:06.920
Their recipe for Formula One success is the topic of conversation.

13:06.920 --> 13:10.520
Because a lot of the money does come from selling just Red Bull cans.

13:10.520 --> 13:13.720
But they also make money from prizes and sponsorships and

13:14.360 --> 13:17.320
more things associated to Formula One.

13:17.320 --> 13:20.280
By the way, we have never talked about Formula One,

13:20.280 --> 13:22.280
but we're happy to if you want us to make a video.

13:22.280 --> 13:23.560
So let us know in the comments.

13:23.560 --> 13:25.560
And then, of course, we have the standalone projects.

13:25.560 --> 13:30.360
That includes spending $30 million to send Baumgarten to the edge of space and back.

13:30.360 --> 13:33.800
A lot of money for sure, but a one-minute video on Red Bull's YouTube

13:33.800 --> 13:35.640
has 47 million views.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.080
What better promotion than that?

13:37.080 --> 13:41.240
It's estimated that in the six months after the jump, sales increased 7%

13:41.240 --> 13:43.160
and global sales 13%.

13:43.160 --> 13:45.240
That's just genius marketing.

13:45.240 --> 13:47.960
In the end, Red Bull is not about beverages.

13:47.960 --> 13:49.080
It's a marketing company.

13:49.080 --> 13:50.840
And it's excellent at it.

13:50.840 --> 13:53.560
Take the German football team, the RB Lebsich.

13:53.560 --> 13:57.560
In 2009, Red Bull purchased the rights to play in the fifth division.

13:57.560 --> 13:59.160
Fifth, they renamed the team.

13:59.160 --> 14:01.080
They invested millions of dollars in it.

14:01.080 --> 14:03.560
And then in 2019, they classified to the Champions League.

14:04.360 --> 14:08.360
Today, this team is worth 500 million euro.

14:08.360 --> 14:12.200
And get this, they don't produce anything, not even the drinks.

14:12.200 --> 14:15.880
That's the job of TC Pharmaceuticals back in old Thailand.

14:15.880 --> 14:17.960
It produces the original concentrate,

14:17.960 --> 14:20.840
and then other outsourced factories just make the different flavors.

14:20.840 --> 14:23.240
Now, there's something maybe about to change,

14:23.240 --> 14:27.800
because this not producing anything model might be about to disappear.

14:27.800 --> 14:31.800
Because rumors say that Red Bull Formula One racing plans to take full responsibility

14:31.800 --> 14:35.960
for manufacturing, producing Formula One engines in 2023.

14:35.960 --> 14:40.920
So this thing began as a drink and now makes performance car engines.

14:40.920 --> 14:45.640
But as for the rest of the products, Red Bull doesn't make the clothing or any goods they sell.

14:45.640 --> 14:50.680
Instead, they just focus on making sure the world sees, hears,

14:50.680 --> 14:53.640
and breathes Red Bull everywhere.

14:53.640 --> 14:55.640
And this applies to the factory even.

14:55.640 --> 15:03.160
Sarvodya Vidya says that 95% of employees don't drink Red Bull when they enter the company.

15:03.160 --> 15:05.800
But once they're in, they just get hooked on it.

15:05.800 --> 15:09.000
So it started with this addicting beverage,

15:09.000 --> 15:12.440
but Mattesic knew that it was not going to end there.

15:12.440 --> 15:14.760
And now the world loves this stuff.

15:14.760 --> 15:16.920
Again, 171 countries.

15:16.920 --> 15:19.480
It dominates the energy drink market.

15:19.560 --> 15:24.520
And of course you have competitors, but we're talking about 7.5 billion cans in a year.

15:24.520 --> 15:30.360
We millennials live at a pace that where we need some extra fuel to get through the day.

15:30.360 --> 15:32.840
So it's at least for us, it's no longer just about the party,

15:32.840 --> 15:34.760
it's about getting through the day.

15:34.760 --> 15:37.160
And that maybe is not that good.

15:38.040 --> 15:46.040
See you next week, guys.
