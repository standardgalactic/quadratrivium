0	12120	Hello and welcome to Imagine Belfast. I'm Alan Mabin and on this penultimate evening
12120	17920	of the 2023 Festival, it's our Festival of Ideas and Politics. What better way, what
17920	23640	better company could we have to spend it than with Noam Chomsky, renowned linguist, philosopher,
23640	28200	political activist and public intellectual and over the years a great friend to this
28200	31760	festival. Noam, you're very welcome back to Imagine Festival.
31760	36320	Thank you very much. Pleased to be with you.
36320	42840	I've been part of quite a few online conversations this week and one of the very common factors
42840	49720	is that there have been stacks of books behind the people. Now tonight you have plants rather
49720	56200	than books but in the past you might have had a good bookcase there. Do you fear that
56200	62040	in the world of screens and so on that words on paper are starting to become less common
62040	64680	by losing their value?
64680	72120	Certainly and there are good measures of it. So there have been studies when going on for
72120	84720	a long time. There have been studies of books that are assigned to young people in schools.
84720	95040	Turns out that even 20, 30 years ago there was a tendency to assign to the high school
95040	101880	students, 12th grade students that used books that used to be read in eighth grade. We get
101880	106360	students coming into the university who don't know how to write an essay. They've never
106360	114520	had that experience. Part of this is the effect of the so-called teaching to test movement
114520	122280	of the last 20 years, Bush, Obama and so on. Part of it is just the decline in reading
122280	127960	all together and it's getting worse. There was a study that just came out a couple days
127960	138280	ago of the, I think it's called Generation Z, the people who were born after 1997, high
138280	146120	school college students asking where do they get their so-called information? Almost none
146120	153760	look at the newspapers, almost none look at television. They didn't stop looking at Facebook
153760	162320	to old fashioned. They're getting their news from channels where kids are having fun dancing
162320	172200	around. Of course, that's having an effect. The social media have other effects. They're
172200	181080	tending to drive people into self-reinforcing bubbles. We're all subject to that. I am too.
181080	188040	When I pick up and start looking at things in the morning, I don't look at Breitbart.
188080	196000	I look at maybe Democracy Now or something like that and conversely, well, the media with all
196000	206560	their limitations have a certain amount of range of discussion and debate limited, but some not
206560	212760	the self-reinforcing bubbles and self-reinforcing is the crucial part. It means you don't get
212760	220840	anything but enhancing your own beliefs and prejudices. Reading is declining along with it.
222920	230040	When it comes to when you're working as an academic, there would be fewer of the journals
230040	235880	that are available on paper, more of them are online, fewer books available on paper. Are you
235920	243160	missing paper-based things? Do you soak in as much information when you're reading on a screen or
243160	252520	have you got used to it? Well, there are plenty of fine books available, but the question is,
252520	260960	do people access them? There's plenty of important information available on the screen. For example,
261440	268240	I can sit in the United States, I can read the foreign press. You learn a lot from it. How many
268240	277920	people do that? Virtually nobody. It's surprising if they even read the national press, let alone
279120	288080	the foreign press. You learn a lot. Recently, I learned about a pretty incredible scandal,
288800	298400	which is not reported here. This is called what aboutism? If you pardon it, I'll talk about the
298400	305920	real world. I'm not allowed to talk about that. Take the invasion of Iraq. There were enormous
305920	313200	atrocities. Some of the worst, most outlandish, outrageous atrocities were the destruction of
313200	323200	Fallujah. Recently, a couple months ago, the US Navy just commissioned its latest assault vessel.
323920	332400	It's called the USS Fallujah in commemoration of one of the most atrocious atrocities of the
332400	338240	worst crime of the 20th century. I didn't learn about it here. I learned about it in Al Jazeera,
339040	345440	where I could also read the reaction of the Iraqis to it, naturally outraged.
348400	356320	That information is available in principle, but you have to be motivated, stimulated,
357520	362640	educated enough to understand that you have to look at things that are available.
363200	374400	That's very rare, unfortunately. If the press and the media are still acting
374400	380880	as mediators between all that information out there and people who are kind of tuning into
380880	389040	either mass read or mass watch stuff, does the media and the press need to do more
389120	395840	to actually increase the range of stories that they tell, or is social media enough
395840	401120	that it's up to each of us to find out that information? Because not everybody is bothered
401120	405840	to wake up in the morning and even listen to the news. Never mind. Go and search it out.
408000	414960	Well, just talk about myself. The first thing I do in the morning when I get up is read the New
414960	424000	York Times and the Washington Post two national newspapers, two national newspapers. That's
424000	431440	important. There used to be lots of newspapers, so there were local high-quality newspapers.
432160	438880	I lived in Boston most of my life. Boston Globe was a pretty substantial paper, had some of the
438880	445920	best reporting, not only domestically, but also internationally, had the best coverage in the
445920	454400	country of the Central America Wars in the 1980s. Actually, the editor was personal friends. Some
454400	464400	of the reporters were gone. Now it's wire service and local news. Same with all over the country,
464400	471760	Detroit Free Press, San Francisco Chronicle, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune,
472880	479520	the newspapers have radically constricted. What happened is that the business model
480480	488240	could not survive the internet. The business model for the media is basically advertising.
488960	497600	So the media are businesses that sell a product, you and me, to other businesses. It's their
497600	505280	central structure that collapsed with the shift of advertising to the internet. One major effect
505280	512720	is radical reduction of the available information in the press. It's had the same effect on the
512800	519120	major press as well. They've constricted. It takes me much less time to read the New York Times today
519120	528640	than it did 30 or 40 years ago because it's constrained, limited. Well, all these are serious
528640	538000	effects of basically the capitalist institutional structure, which imposes a certain constraint
538000	543840	on the nature of media. Could be changed by public media. Actually, they've declined too,
544720	554240	but it's not an issue in the United States because we don't have them. That's no BBC, no German
554240	561760	national television. The reason for that is a difference between the United States and other
561760	568000	state capitalist societies. The United States has a very powerful business class,
568800	577280	class conscience, constantly fighting a savage class war. This showed up with the media, showed
577280	587120	up with radio in the 1920s, early 30s. There were attempts to popular attempts, popular groups,
587200	594080	political groups, church groups, others to try to create national media, public media,
594080	601600	that would respond to interests of the general population was defeated by a corporate opinion
601600	607200	to turn it into private media. Same thing happened with television 20 years later.
608160	617120	A result in the United States is essentially no public media margin, even that is corporate funding.
619440	626240	That's lost. You have to find other means to try to get out of the institutional factors
626320	636960	based on particular forms of savage capitalism, state capitalism that are constraining the
637760	645920	means of information available. Now, they are there. You can go to the internet and find out
645920	656080	quite a lot. I just think that that's a special for a marginal part of the population, even among
656080	664480	the educated classes, very few do it. While we're talking about the media, can we talk about Fox News?
665120	673200	Can we talk about Dominion voting systems with their defamation case? There nearly seems to be
673280	678560	more written about Rupert Murdoch who's going to get married again than there is written about the
678560	685680	actual case and the arguments that are going on in court. Should we be surprised that actually
685680	691520	that certainly over on this side of the Atlantic, it's getting reported but just a little.
692640	697840	It's not a big story, whereas it could have big implications for Fox News. It could have big
697840	705840	implications for your next presidential election. I doubt that it'll have much one effect. First
705840	712160	of all, Fox News is not a news channel. It's an echo chamber for the far right.
713840	720720	You're familiar with that in England. The Murdoch system is not interested in providing
720720	730160	news to people. It's providing echo chambers for far right propaganda. Fox News is kind of
730160	737920	interesting. I look at it sometimes just to see how wild and extremely far right can be. It's kind
737920	743760	of amusing. Sometimes I actually tell you the truth. They're a little more open in some respects
743840	751680	than the major media. For example, personal experience. I've had interviews and discussion
751680	763280	on Fox News, not in the major media. That would be very, very rare. I suspect that this scandal,
763280	775200	the court case, will blow over somehow and they'll have the same role in the coming period of
775200	784720	political confrontations. Do you still value, even if you don't see it as a news channel,
784720	791840	do you still value it as part of the plurality of outlets telling the same stories in different
791840	806080	ways? Is it still valuable to have it there? Well, frankly, I don't see much value in having a
806720	812320	pure propaganda channel. You live in Russia. Yes, that's what you have, but I don't think we need it.
812880	819920	What we need is to strengthen, expand the actual media system. So, for example,
828640	836160	there were serious and other ways of public support. There aren't technical means to do that.
836720	841680	There are people actually working on it, like Robert Bobman Chesney,
844720	850080	who is a scholar at the University of Illinois. I'm just trying to reconstruct
853280	862160	significant local media system, also the level of national media. But the main point is, the main
862160	869440	goal is educating people to recognize that there are things you have to understand about the world,
869440	876400	and you're not going to find them from a limited, even a limited media system, certainly not from
876400	882560	social media. Now, this goes back to questions about what's happening to the whole social order.
883200	890240	Why aren't people getting together to look at these things? They used to. One reason is there
890240	900480	used to be something called unions, labor unions. Labor unions were not just ways of raising wages.
901440	910880	They were cultural educational institutions. Adult education was a core part of the union
910880	918800	programs. Unions are places where people could get together, discuss, study, cultural events,
920480	927280	Reagan and Thatcher or their advisors were very sensible when they launched the
927840	934960	neoliberal assault against the population. First move, destroy the unions, the one way that people
934960	943120	have to have to protect and defend themselves. That was very effective. New labor Clinton,
943120	949920	they gave their own support to it. Now it's pretty much
951520	963680	on the United States almost gone. Another modes of intercommunication, when people you get atomization,
964320	976400	isolation, easy prey to demagogues of the Trump variety, to fake news organizations like the
976400	986320	Murdoch media. People that don't have the means of self-defense that they had when they were
986400	994320	organized, could interact with one another, mutual support, solidarity, common goals and so on.
995040	1000240	It's very interesting to see how powerful the efforts are to destroy this.
1001440	1009920	Just saw a remarkable case in England with the Corbyn phenomenon. Corbyn broke with this
1010880	1021840	long-term policy pursued by the Tory government and the Blair right new labor. What he did was
1023120	1030640	a real crime. He tried to create a labor party that would be a participatory party
1031440	1038240	and would respond to the needs and concerns of working people and the poor and it was very
1038320	1050000	successful. 2017, they were under his influence when the biggest victory they had, as far back as
1050000	1058880	you can imagine, the whole establishment came down on him like a ton of bricks from the right wing
1058880	1066400	over to the Guardian and have this. We cannot have an authentic political party
1068720	1076800	that will break with domination by a small elite committed to the rich and powerful.
1078640	1086000	You know what happened? It was charges of total fakery about anti-Semitism. It was all exposed.
1086000	1092400	You could read the extensive exposure and held to zero again, but even the Labor Party's own
1093200	1100480	commission looking into it exposed it as a fraud. No effect. Now, this is too important. We cannot
1100480	1107680	allow a development like that. That might lead to a functioning democratic society.
1108320	1115040	We don't want that. This is a society which must be in the hands of the rich and the powerful.
1116960	1124880	We are fighting a constant class war, no break from that. It's very striking. Something similar
1124880	1132320	happened in the United States, less extreme, with the Democratic party, the Clintonite party
1133200	1140880	moving along with the media to try to crush the Sanders phenomenon. It wasn't as extreme as in England,
1141680	1148000	but it had the effect of pretty much marginalizing the popular forces.
1150160	1155680	I suspect there are those who are members of the Labor Party in the UK who would dispute
1156880	1164800	your conclusion, but it does point to a difficulty when a party wants to change quickly,
1165440	1172080	when it wants to either go back to old values or new values. That seems a very difficult thing
1172080	1176640	for them to achieve. Is that going to be difficult for the Republican party to achieve if it wants
1177280	1182800	not to have Trump or if the Democrats want to reinvent? They don't seem terribly sure what
1182800	1188160	their ideology is at the moment. They're searching in terms of their policies. They're not selling
1188160	1196160	them well. I don't think that's the issue. It's very easy for a Republican to change. Let's take
1196160	1205360	the Republican Party in the United States. 2008, the Republican candidate for president was John
1205360	1216240	McCain. The most important issue in human affairs is the environmental crisis, which is going to
1216320	1221520	destroy organized human life on earth. That's the most important issue in history.
1222240	1231360	Well, 2008, the Republican Party did begin to move towards a small, limited climate program.
1232000	1243840	Not much, but something. McCain had a climate most part of the platform,
1243920	1249920	congressional Republicans were looking into things. The Koch brothers energy conglomerate,
1249920	1259840	huge conglomerate, which had been working for years to try to ensure that there was no interference
1259840	1266080	with their campaign to destroy organized human life on earth. When they, as soon as the Republican
1266080	1274960	Party began to shift immediately, they launched an enormous juggernaut intimidation, bribery,
1274960	1283360	threats, massive lobbying, asterisks, or asterisk organizations. The Republican Party turned on
1283360	1293440	a dime. They all turned total denialism. It's very easy to change a party's direction if you have
1293440	1302800	massive capital working for savage class war, plenty of other cases. So the issue is not
1305040	1312400	difficulty of changing. The problem was the kind of change that Corbyn was trying to bring about,
1313280	1322400	a change to a labor party that would be a participatory party and concerned with the needs
1322400	1330160	of its constituents. And even worse than that, what was their success? Couldn't be tolerated.
1330720	1337280	Yes, there are people in Cure Starmer's party who will object to what I'm saying, but I'm afraid
1337280	1344480	it's the truth. When it comes to the next presidential election on your side of the Atlantic,
1345840	1350880	can America cope with another four years of Trump or another four years of Biden?
1352560	1363680	Well, the Republican Party really shouldn't be called a party anymore. I'd prefer the terms used by
1363680	1372960	the political analysts of the conservative American Enterprise Institute who refer to it as a radical
1372960	1380480	insurgency that has abandoned parliamentary politics. That's pretty accurate. If you look at
1380560	1388080	international rankings of attitudes and so on, the Republican Party, if you want to call it that,
1388080	1396320	ranks alongside the far-right parties in Europe with neo-fascist origins. And they've totally
1396320	1402400	abandoned parliamentary politics. All you have to do is look at their programs. It's not even a joke.
1403360	1411360	Program is block anything, anything that might harm profit and power of the very rich in the
1411360	1417440	corporate sector. But right at the moment, sometimes it's almost comical, right at the moment,
1418400	1425440	now that they've taken over the House, lead program, prevent the internal revenues
1426240	1434240	service from checking tax cheats. That's their main program. Who are the tax cheats? Working people
1434240	1442000	who file their income tax, rich and powerful, who have a battery of corporate lawyers who figure
1442000	1450800	out a way not to pay taxes. The top program prevent the internet internally IRS from investigating
1451760	1460800	them. Take a look at Trump's legislative programs. One achievement, a massive tax cut for the very
1460800	1470400	rich in the corporate sector, stabbing everyone else in the back. Lead, a top issue for the
1470400	1479120	Republican Party is don't touch the tax cut. The Biden administration came in with a
1480080	1485440	moderately decent, not enough, but some kind of climate program. Actually,
1486240	1493600	pretty significant advance over earlier ones, which is not saying much. Cut back point by point,
1493600	1503840	step by step, by 100% Republican opposition. Not a single Republican would break ranks to say,
1504480	1510480	let's do something about a climate problem which they know perfectly well has come and destroyed
1511360	1515520	human civilization. Well, that's not a political party.
1517520	1524960	You mentioned earlier in terms of social media and the bubbles and that we naturally end up in
1524960	1531920	hearing more of what we already believe. Why can that not be weaponized by those who want change?
1532560	1538640	Because you could argue either with unions and that there are ways of people online
1539200	1545760	finding kindred spirits, lobbying, kind of building up power, or you could say in terms of
1546320	1552000	challenging political parties around climate change. Why are those tools that are free and
1552000	1557840	available not being weaponized by those who want to actually challenge those with power,
1557920	1563760	those with corporate interests? Why is there not a grassroots revolution? What stops that?
1566480	1573440	Well, it's not so easy to form a grassroots movement. You're against concentrated
1575120	1580880	state and private power. When you try to do it, take a look at what happened to Corbyn.
1581840	1588240	Take a look at what happened to the Republican Party when it started to veer slightly towards
1588880	1591920	environment. Take a look at what's happened to the labor movement.
1596640	1601040	Not for, in fact, you can ask yourself another question. Take a look at what happened. Take
1601040	1608960	the United States, which is the leading in the lead in the neoliberal assault against the world,
1608960	1616800	against the population. Well, there's measures of what's happened. The Miranda Corporation,
1616800	1623280	very respectable quasi-governmental research corporation, did a study of the
1624960	1633440	general economic effects of the neoliberal period. Over 40 years, they found,
1633440	1641680	they studied what they called a lightly transfer of wealth, highway robbery to be more exact,
1642400	1649840	transfer of wealth from the working class and the middle class, lower 90% of the population
1650400	1662560	transferred to the top 1%, $50 trillion in 40 years. That's very effective class war.
1663440	1671600	Well, you have concentrated economic power on one side, largely controlling the state. You have
1672240	1679120	general population on the other side when there are efforts to make some moves. Concentrated power
1680240	1688560	comes down on them very hard for the unions, Corbyn efforts, Sanders efforts, Lyman.
1689520	1699520	You can fight against it. Over the centuries, there's been many victories. We don't have slavery.
1700080	1707440	We don't have a few laws. There are victories, but they're hard to win. You have to recall,
1707440	1715920	remember that those with, go back to Adam Smith at the beginning of the early days of the
1716880	1725520	capitalist industrial revolution. I was an astute observer. He pointed out that in all ages,
1726640	1735520	the masters of mankind pursue their vile maxim, all for ourselves, nothing for anyone else.
1736480	1742800	Well, that was in the early stages. Now it's much more organized and controlled and so on,
1742800	1749600	but the vile maxim still prevails, and you can see its consequences. You can fight against it.
1750320	1756400	There have been victories, lots of victories even in recent years, but it's a struggle,
1756400	1761120	and you're not going to win unless you recognize what the nature of the struggle is.
1763200	1770160	Another threat might be cyber war. We've mentioned a few threats in the last few minutes.
1770720	1775760	One of the speakers at the festival yesterday talked about the possibility that China might
1775760	1782560	try and invade Taiwan. He suggested that militarily that could probably be defended,
1782560	1787760	but the consequence would be that China might unleash a cyber war on the west
1787760	1795440	that we couldn't defend against. Does that technological war worry you? Is that on your list
1795440	1803360	of things that are challenging humanity along with nuclear power and climate change and ordinary
1803360	1812480	war and so on? Well, we have to bear in mind that the world's major propaganda system in the United
1812480	1821520	States, which also has an enormous effect on Britain, largely the satellite of the United
1821600	1830400	States by now, one of its main themes is you have to hate China, critical, yellow peril,
1831200	1836960	so we have to be very worried about China invading Taiwan. Is there any sign of that?
1839440	1845680	There's some good point to build up of military in the area, exercises that are going very close
1845680	1856640	to airspace. Military exercises largely in response to US provocation. So when there is
1857440	1866880	a policy called the One China Policy, it's been in place for 50 years, was settled in the 1970s.
1866880	1876880	The policy is US and China agree that Taiwan is part of China and both agree to what was called
1876880	1886320	strategic ambiguity. We don't say it in words, but we agree that we will do nothing to disrupt
1887120	1898000	this program by threats to challenging. Who's been challenging it? China's not a saintly power,
1898000	1905680	there's plenty you can preserve. But in reality, in this case, it's the US that's been provoking it,
1905760	1916800	partly just militarily. The official US policy is quoting it to encircle China
1917520	1926960	with a ring of sentinel states with advanced weapons, advanced precision weapons aimed at China,
1927920	1944240	South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Guam, Australia, all surrounding China to encircle and constrain it.
1945280	1953040	In the case of Taiwan, the US has been regularly breaking the strategic ambiguity.
1953760	1962480	So when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi went to Taiwan, that was saying we're breaking the
1962480	1971760	arrangements. China did respond, as you described, with naval maneuvers, to indicate that it can,
1971760	1980240	if it wants, blockade Taiwan. This has continued. Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed the
1980240	1990560	Taiwan Policy Act, which says that Taiwan has to be treated as a normal non-nado ally with normal
1990560	2002080	diplomatic relations, weapon systems, interoperability of weapons, and so on. China reacts by carrying
2002160	2011520	out symbolic actions in the region around China. Those are not the only naval actions.
2011520	2018560	There are others that you didn't mention, like RIMPAC, enormous naval operations run by the
2018560	2025440	United States and its allies threatening China. But we don't talk about that. Since we own and
2025440	2031600	run the world, what we do is fine. We have to worry about it. We have to concentrate on people
2031600	2040720	who are violating the rules we establish. Right now, the United States has openly, publicly
2040720	2051120	declared an economic war with China to try to prevent it from developing the advanced technologies
2051120	2058480	that we need for the modern age. It's not a secret. You read about it in the London Financial Times,
2058480	2068400	which describes it correctly as a war against China. China is reacting now by things like
2068400	2076000	the initiatives to bring Saudi Arabia and Iran together to overcome that conflict and to throw
2076000	2084560	wrench in U.S. policy of dominating the Middle East through an alliance of reactionary states
2085040	2091680	called the Abraham Accord, including Saudi Arabia as a central, not a literal, but
2091680	2100960	partner, aimed at U.S. enemy Iran. China is disrupting that to blow to U.S. and Israel.
2101760	2109200	So, yes, these things are happening in the world. But if we're within inside the U.S.
2109200	2117440	propaganda bubble, as Britain mostly is, then, of course, we have to hate China and talk about
2117440	2122400	all the terrible things that China might be doing, but not talk about what we're doing,
2122400	2126640	because that's quite proper and appropriate since we own the world.
2127760	2134240	You have spoken out, if we kind of move to Russia and Ukraine, you have spoken out
2134880	2141440	and cautioned against how people view NATO. You have, I think, kind of reminded people
2142320	2150640	that they need to look at NATO without kind of, without looking through rose-tinted glasses.
2150640	2155440	So they need to kind of be careful how they view Russia, but also careful how they view NATO.
2156480	2160800	And I think you've talked about the fact that kind of negotiation should be happening, that
2160800	2167120	the U.S. should be promoting peace negotiations and so on. Do you see any evidence of that?
2167680	2173920	And do you think a modern war could be ended through negotiation, rather than having one
2173920	2183520	winner and one loser? Right now, the positions of the opposing parties
2183600	2192160	are, look, irreconcilable on paper, but that's where diplomacy and negotiations enter.
2193040	2197840	You see if you can make moves towards overcoming it, and there are proposals.
2200480	2208240	An article in the current issue of the Monte Diplomatique by two Finnish diplomats talks about
2208240	2213600	means you could use. Well, right now, the United States has an official position,
2214400	2220320	and Britain, as a loyal satellite of the United States, simply repeats the position.
2221040	2226960	The position is, we must continue the war in order to severely weaken Russia.
2227920	2235440	That's the official U.S. position. Basically, the U.S. imposed it on NATO. NATO, incidentally,
2235440	2240880	is now a Pacific power. Of course, the United States, at the latest summit meeting,
2241600	2247280	determined that NATO must support the United States' confrontation with China and the Pacific.
2247920	2257920	But the U.S. position is perfectly explicit. No diplomacy until, because we must severely
2257920	2263680	weaken Russia. Now, if you look at it, the United States is getting a bargain.
2264640	2273360	Not a big secret. It's discussed in Chatham House by U.S. commentators. For a small portion
2274000	2282400	of the U.S. colossal military budget, it's severely degrading the military forces of its own
2282400	2288640	only military adversary. That's a bargain. The United States is getting another bargain.
2289600	2295120	Putin's invasion of Ukraine is, of course, criminal aggression.
2295920	2303040	Major war crime. Also, an act of criminal stupidity from his point of view. It gave the
2303040	2312960	United States its most welcome gift on a silver platter. Europe drove Europe into the pocket of
2312960	2320640	the United States. It was an alternative. Combination between Europe and the East. Very
2320640	2329200	natural. The continental Europe has a very effective industrial system, German-based
2329200	2336560	industrial system, complex system. It's based very heavily on the relations with their natural
2336560	2342800	commercial partner to the East. Russia doesn't have much of an economy. It's about at the level
2342800	2351920	of Mexico. It has rich resources, raw materials, not just oil, petroleum, but minerals, and so on.
2352640	2361120	It's a path to the China market, enormous China market. In fact, the major EU market.
2362560	2370320	One possibility for Putin was to accept efforts at accommodation, which were, in fact, presented
2370320	2377680	regularly, particularly by Emmanuel Macron, telephone conversations up to a couple of
2377680	2386000	days before the invasion. Not interested in wanting to drive Europe into the US pocket.
2386640	2393200	Well, for Europe, that's pretty serious. Europe, while the United States is gaining enormously
2393200	2400000	from the war, not just financially in terms of military power, but even geopolitically
2400640	2409440	with Europe now subordinated to it, Europe is facing a serious problem. Economist Magazine
2409440	2416880	points out that Europe is facing a kind of the industrialization, not just from its break,
2416960	2423680	from its commercial partners to the East, but even with regard to China. So part of the
2424400	2434240	US war against China is to compel other countries, European countries, to break their relations
2434240	2442720	with the China market. Pretty serious. Take a look at the Netherlands as the world's most advanced
2443360	2450800	lithographic industry, which produces essential parts for computer chips,
2450800	2458960	to semiconductors, and so on. The United States is ordering them, lose your main market, China.
2460160	2467680	Will they agree? We don't know. Ordering Samsung in South Korea to do the same thing.
2468560	2474400	You lose your main market, because we don't want China to develop. Same in Japan.
2475280	2484320	Will they accept it? Open question. Let's go back to crime. Just look at logic for a moment.
2485280	2493520	Either the war will be a stalemate and continue indefinitely, or it'll be settled.
2494400	2502320	Can't argue about that. That's logic. Well, if it's a stalemate, Ukraine is going to suffer
2502320	2509120	miserably. It's already being severely harmed to military forces,
2509920	2517840	badly harmed, economy severely harmed. Go on with the stalemate, it'll get much worse.
2517920	2524880	Russia will be harmed too, but too much more. Substantial society will probably survive it.
2525760	2531760	That's if there's a stalemate. Alternative to a stalemate, one of two possibilities.
2532560	2540000	Either one side capitulates, or there's a negotiated settlement. Well, Russia is not
2540000	2547840	going to capitulate. That's pretty clear. The alternative is a negotiated settlement,
2548560	2557520	diplomacy. Who's in favor of it? Who's against it? The United States and its British satellite
2557520	2565920	are against it. We must continue the war to weaken Russia. In fact, that happened dramatically
2565920	2575440	last March. There were negotiations underway between Ukraine and Russia under Turkish auspices.
2576160	2583440	Boris Johnson, who was then the prime minister, flew to Kyiv and informed the Ukrainians that
2584240	2590240	Britain and the United States don't think this is the time for negotiations. He was followed by
2590880	2598240	US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, the Western media don't cover this. It's not a proper topic
2598240	2604800	for them, but apparently he gave his usual message of no negotiations. Now I have to
2604800	2610560	continue with the war. Well, the negotiations crashed. We don't actually know the reasons
2610560	2616720	there's very little coverage, but that was probably part of it at least. But the US and Britain
2616720	2626400	persist in saying we must continue the war to weaken Russia. Now there is an official
2627120	2634400	version of this. It says we must continue the war so that Ukraine will be in a better negotiating
2634400	2641440	position. Does that make sense? Ukraine's going to be in a worse negotiation position,
2642400	2650080	suffering badly. So let's tell the truth. We have to fight the war, continue the war,
2650080	2657200	to weaken Russia, strengthen ourselves at the cost of everyone else, mainly Ukrainians.
2657920	2665120	Well, how does the world react to this? The world says we don't want it. Almost the entire world
2665200	2672080	opposes this position. Check back at the Munich Strategic Conference a couple of weeks ago,
2672080	2679200	the International Conference. The United States made every effort to try to bring
2679760	2689600	the global south into support for the US campaign in Ukraine. Nobody, not India,
2689680	2697840	not Indonesia, not long-time US allies like Colombia, Brazil. They all said no.
2699840	2705440	What they said is this is a proxy war between you and Russia. We don't have any part of it.
2706080	2712240	We're certainly not going to pay attention to the bombast that comes out of the British and
2712240	2719040	American media and propaganda system about fighting a noble war for democracy.
2719680	2726320	We've had enough experience with you to know what that means, hundreds of years of experience.
2726880	2733200	So keep your bombast and pretentiousness for yourselves. We're looking at the actual world.
2733920	2738800	We don't want to be part of this. We would like to see a diplomatic settlement that will end the
2738800	2747840	horrors before they get worse. Take continental Europe. There's a difference between a lead opinion
2748400	2752480	and public opinion. We have polls. These are free countries.
2753440	2762560	Polls show strong support for negotiation and diplomacy. The educated classes, the media say,
2762560	2770960	no, we have to go along with the US-British no negotiations policy. That's the way the world
2771040	2777520	is dividing up. Well, what does this mean for Ukraine? Just think through the logic and just
2777520	2785840	plain logic. Russia is not going to capitulate. Ukraine is not going to get in a better negotiating
2785840	2793600	position. Either there will be some kind of stalemate, which will be devastating for Ukraine,
2794320	2800960	very dangerous in other respects, arms, millions of people in the world because of
2801600	2810400	the curtailing of grain and fertilizer exports. Very significant threat of escalation to major war.
2811600	2818560	So far, Russia has not emulated the US-British war style of war.
2818640	2831360	President Biden, Janet Yellen, other officials have visited Kyiv. Do you remember anybody who
2831360	2839920	visited Baghdad when the US and Britain were pounding at the dust? Remember anybody? No.
2839920	2846480	In fact, the few peace volunteers who were there were ordered out of the country because the United
2846480	2854880	States and Britain were smashing it up properly. That's a difference. It might move to expand the
2854880	2863600	war to the US-British style, go after the jugular, destroy communications, destroy energy,
2865280	2873760	destroy transportation, destroy everything that allows the country to function, go after
2873760	2881760	Western Ukraine with a vengeance, attack supply routes, presumably leave you in the confrontation
2881760	2889520	with NATO. Then what happens? Now it's tanks. It's beginning with jet planes. Next will be a
2889520	2896640	further escalation. The Ukrainians are the ones who'll suffer most, but the rest of the world is
2896640	2904800	also facing a problem. Well, the Ukrainians make their own decisions. What they decide,
2904800	2912240	we should support. They have a right to defend themselves. But we have our own countries to
2912240	2922960	care about. We are responsible for US, British, Irish, German policy. People of the countries
2922960	2930960	are responsible for it. I'm in the United States. Should we support a policy that says,
2931760	2938320	let's continue to fight the war, no matter how devastating the effect in order to severely
2938320	2947360	weaken Russia? No, I don't think so. We should stop the campaign to block negotiations and diplomacy.
2948000	2954480	Can they succeed? You don't know unless they try. They'll try. Of course, they don't succeed.
2955600	2962640	If there were to be a negotiated settlement or to be negotiations, could the result ever be
2963520	2969120	just from a Ukrainian point of view? Is that just a moral?
2969120	2976800	Diplomatic settlements. Diplomatic settlements almost by definition are not just a diplomatic
2976800	2983760	settlement as one which all sides accept reluctantly because none of them get their
2983760	2990880	maximum objectives, but they see that as the best of the possible outcomes or at least the least
2990880	3004000	worse. That's the nature of diplomatic settlements. If you don't want that, let's escalate to total
3004000	3013920	destruction. Yeah. We've about 10 minutes left. I'm going to come to a couple of questions from
3013920	3019120	people who are watching in a minute, but maybe if we could look at, I suppose, the rise of the
3019120	3024320	algorithm, the rise of those things. We've touched on it with social media, but we have
3025200	3031600	news this week, I think, that in France for the Paris Olympics, facial recognition will be allowed
3031600	3037840	on a so-called temporary basis until the end of the Olympics. What is temporary often becomes
3037840	3045440	very permanent. We've also got things like chat GPT, the so-called artificial intelligence chatbot
3045440	3052400	that can take your question and go off and give you a bit of an answer. What do you think about
3052400	3059520	that kind of our reliance on machines to make decisions? If you like taking the human out of
3059520	3065840	the loop, is that a danger or is that just part of technology? It's part of just modernizing,
3066320	3071600	and every technology has its good sides and its bad sides. Do these things particularly worry you?
3075040	3086640	For example, there's some of the crazier proposals are that the systems of automatic
3086640	3099280	warning of missile attacks should be automated to death sentence. We've had 70 years of experience
3100080	3109040	of virtual, coming very close to terminal nuclear war because the systems that
3109680	3119680	of our design carefully sophisticated way to determine if there's some say enemy missile attack
3120320	3129760	have failed and human intervention was necessary to prevent the end termination of human life on
3129760	3141600	earth. It's going to get worse if you automate them further. What has saved us so far is human
3141600	3149120	intervention. Several, I don't have to go through the details, but there were several cases that
3149120	3155760	are well known where Russian officials just refused to accept the information that was coming in,
3155760	3161920	just didn't hand it on to the higher authorities. That's why we're alive. Hotlines are useful things
3161920	3170320	for humans to talk to each other. It wasn't even a hunt. It was just a middle level official saying
3170320	3177280	this can't be real. I'm not going to send it on. It was one during the Cuban Missile Crisis when
3177280	3184640	Russian submarines were under attack by US destroyers. They thought they'd lost contact with
3185600	3190880	central authorities, thought a war was on. Commander decided we might as well launch our
3191760	3197920	torpedoes, which happened to be nuclear tipped, would have ended everything because of the reaction.
3198880	3208080	One officer, Vasily Akhapov, decided to veto it. So we're now talking.
3208640	3215520	There was a case when Defense Secretary William Perry was almost on the phone,
3216160	3222240	called President Carter, to tell him that the sophisticated US warning systems that
3222240	3228640	detected a Russian attack, he had now a couple minutes to respond. He got a call from the
3230000	3235280	central official, the monitoring official, said we made a computer error. Hold it off.
3236080	3242480	You want to go into that kind of system? Okay. But let's not have a look. First of all, we're very
3243840	3249920	incredible. These are all human decisions. There's no technology forcing anything, nothing.
3250640	3259360	We have to remember that the propaganda and the hype about these systems vastly exceeds the reality.
3260240	3266960	You can read all sorts of excited articles in the newspapers, papers about
3267760	3280560	chatbot being surpassing human intelligence. Are they sentient? This is total nonsense.
3281200	3286480	This is basically high-tech plagiarism. You look into the nature of the systems,
3287440	3293760	they're designed in such a way that in principle, they can tell you absolutely nothing about
3294640	3301600	language, learning, cognition, and so on. They're doing something else. Nice toys, if you like.
3302160	3308480	But no constructive purpose that anyone can think of. But they are dangerous. There are already
3308480	3315520	cases. There was an article in the Washington Post a couple days ago about one case in which a
3316400	3324960	something like a chatbot system, which was combined with artificial image creation,
3324960	3330240	which is not that difficult these days, which was used for a major defamation project.
3331280	3336320	Well, we're going to see more and that more and more of that. These are wonderful techniques for
3336880	3344400	defamation, for disinformation. When bots get involved with powerful systems behind them,
3344880	3352720	like states can be a major danger. They should certainly be concerned about that.
3353440	3363280	But as far as taking over, doing all kind of scary things, that's us, not them.
3365200	3369520	I might be dealing with this quickly, but if a question comes in, you've mentioned
3369520	3376400	Washington Post, the New York Times, your morning routine of finding news from different places.
3376400	3381200	Algae Zero, you've mentioned a few times. A question in that says, what are some of the
3381200	3387440	important places that people might look for information that gives them a balance? Should
3387440	3396240	they be looking at Brit Parts and the Daily Mail and Fox News as well as what you might
3396240	3400640	see as more reputable, more impartial places? Or should they stick to kind of a set of places?
3400640	3405360	Is there a list you have in mind of places you enjoy finding out things?
3408080	3413920	There's no such thing as impartial. I'm not impartial. You're not impartial. You should
3413920	3420720	understand it. You should be honest. It says, here's my view of the world. Understand it.
3421200	3429920	Interpret what I'm saying on the basis of my own perception of how the world works.
3430800	3435920	That's what the newspapers should be doing. Not saying I'm unbiased and neutral because
3435920	3442720	they're not. Nobody is. Let's be honest about what we are. I try to be. You try to be.
3443680	3449760	Talk to an audience. I say, here's the way I view the world. You don't have to accept it.
3449760	3456400	Just see if it makes sense or not to you. Now, if you look at the media, if I was in,
3457120	3462800	I say London, if I went on to spend time in London, the first thing to do in the morning
3462800	3471120	is pick up half of these major newspapers. The media environment is different from the
3471680	3477120	United States. You have to read half a dozen newspapers to get some degree of coverage.
3477120	3485600	But you do. There's scariest journalism. Journalists themselves, especially correspondence
3485600	3490720	on the ground, do excellent work. Honest, courageous, and learn a lot from them.
3491920	3498480	Read the major media. Read the business press, which is often very illuminating.
3501280	3510080	There are biases on their face. No problem. But financial times are very revealing material.
3511680	3517680	And then look for things that are of particular interest to you. There's no algorithms for it.
3518800	3523120	Too much goes on in the world to know everything. But what you're interested in,
3523120	3529200	you think are important pursuers. But don't get caught up in self-reinforcing bubbles.
3529920	3536880	And assume that what the major media are presenting is an accurate picture of the world.
3537600	3544960	They're presenting it from a certain perspective, which is largely subordinate to powerful,
3546560	3552800	to concentrated power in the private system and in the state system, which are closely related,
3552800	3558880	of course, in state-connected societies. So understand the nature of the institutions
3558880	3566560	and take a careful look with a critical eye. Recognize that we're fine journalists,
3566560	3570160	trustworthy, and so on. That's the way it can proceed.
3570960	3574640	I'm going to paraphrase one last question here from someone.
3577440	3581280	You speak a lot. You're very generous with your time to different groups and different audiences.
3582400	3587040	The danger of talking a lot is that there's a lot on record of what you've said.
3587600	3593920	Do you often change your mind on topics and things that you once thought you had worked out
3593920	3599280	and then think, you know, I've learned more, actually, it's a bit more nuanced than that?
3599280	3603680	Or are there things that you do kind of swing around on over time?
3606880	3608240	Learn things over time.
3608240	3609200	You're human after all.
3609920	3617680	You have a critical open mind. You're constantly criticizing yourself.
3618480	3622160	Did I understand this correctly? Is there something I should look at?
3622960	3631680	I should say that I'm pretty conservative in that respect. So my major conception of how the world
3631680	3643440	works hasn't changed much since I was 15 years old. Actually, the first article I wrote back in
3644560	3654880	1939 was a warning about at a 10-year-old level. I don't suggest anybody read it.
3654880	3660080	What was a warning about the spread of fascism in Europe, which looked ominous at the time and
3660160	3663520	inexorable, still concerned about?
3665920	3669680	I think we're probably out of time. We've had an hour of your time this evening or
3669680	3674160	this afternoon for you. Noam Chomsky, you've been very generous with the festival over the years.
3674880	3679840	Thank you so much for dropping in again this year to help us think about ideas and politics.
3680720	3685280	For those who are watching at home, if you're in and about Belfast, tomorrow is the final day of
3685280	3689680	the festival. A few more events that you can kind of attend. If you're watching online,
3689680	3693440	if you click through to the YouTube channel for the festival, you can see some of the other
3693440	3698080	events we had this year and certainly a back catalogue of things over previous years,
3698080	3701760	including Noam Chomsky talking to William Crawley probably two years ago,
3701760	3707280	or maybe even a few years before that as well. But to close, thank you very much, sir, for your time.
3708080	3710800	Noam Chomsky, thank you and good night.
3719680	3721060	you
