00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,120
Hello and welcome to Imagine Belfast. I'm Alan Mabin and on this penultimate evening

2
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,920
of the 2023 Festival, it's our Festival of Ideas and Politics. What better way, what

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,640
better company could we have to spend it than with Noam Chomsky, renowned linguist, philosopher,

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,200
political activist and public intellectual and over the years a great friend to this

5
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,760
festival. Noam, you're very welcome back to Imagine Festival.

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,320
Thank you very much. Pleased to be with you.

7
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:42,840
I've been part of quite a few online conversations this week and one of the very common factors

8
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,720
is that there have been stacks of books behind the people. Now tonight you have plants rather

9
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:56,200
than books but in the past you might have had a good bookcase there. Do you fear that

10
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:02,040
in the world of screens and so on that words on paper are starting to become less common

11
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,680
by losing their value?

12
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:12,120
Certainly and there are good measures of it. So there have been studies when going on for

13
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:24,720
a long time. There have been studies of books that are assigned to young people in schools.

14
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:35,040
Turns out that even 20, 30 years ago there was a tendency to assign to the high school

15
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,880
students, 12th grade students that used books that used to be read in eighth grade. We get

16
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,360
students coming into the university who don't know how to write an essay. They've never

17
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:54,520
had that experience. Part of this is the effect of the so-called teaching to test movement

18
00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:02,280
of the last 20 years, Bush, Obama and so on. Part of it is just the decline in reading

19
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,960
all together and it's getting worse. There was a study that just came out a couple days

20
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:18,280
ago of the, I think it's called Generation Z, the people who were born after 1997, high

21
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:26,120
school college students asking where do they get their so-called information? Almost none

22
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:33,760
look at the newspapers, almost none look at television. They didn't stop looking at Facebook

23
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:42,320
to old fashioned. They're getting their news from channels where kids are having fun dancing

24
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:52,200
around. Of course, that's having an effect. The social media have other effects. They're

25
00:02:52,200 --> 00:03:01,080
tending to drive people into self-reinforcing bubbles. We're all subject to that. I am too.

26
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:08,040
When I pick up and start looking at things in the morning, I don't look at Breitbart.

27
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:16,000
I look at maybe Democracy Now or something like that and conversely, well, the media with all

28
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:26,560
their limitations have a certain amount of range of discussion and debate limited, but some not

29
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,760
the self-reinforcing bubbles and self-reinforcing is the crucial part. It means you don't get

30
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:40,840
anything but enhancing your own beliefs and prejudices. Reading is declining along with it.

31
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:50,040
When it comes to when you're working as an academic, there would be fewer of the journals

32
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:55,880
that are available on paper, more of them are online, fewer books available on paper. Are you

33
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:03,160
missing paper-based things? Do you soak in as much information when you're reading on a screen or

34
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:12,520
have you got used to it? Well, there are plenty of fine books available, but the question is,

35
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:20,960
do people access them? There's plenty of important information available on the screen. For example,

36
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:28,240
I can sit in the United States, I can read the foreign press. You learn a lot from it. How many

37
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:37,920
people do that? Virtually nobody. It's surprising if they even read the national press, let alone

38
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:48,080
the foreign press. You learn a lot. Recently, I learned about a pretty incredible scandal,

39
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:58,400
which is not reported here. This is called what aboutism? If you pardon it, I'll talk about the

40
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:05,920
real world. I'm not allowed to talk about that. Take the invasion of Iraq. There were enormous

41
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:13,200
atrocities. Some of the worst, most outlandish, outrageous atrocities were the destruction of

42
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:23,200
Fallujah. Recently, a couple months ago, the US Navy just commissioned its latest assault vessel.

43
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:32,400
It's called the USS Fallujah in commemoration of one of the most atrocious atrocities of the

44
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,240
worst crime of the 20th century. I didn't learn about it here. I learned about it in Al Jazeera,

45
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:45,440
where I could also read the reaction of the Iraqis to it, naturally outraged.

46
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:56,320
That information is available in principle, but you have to be motivated, stimulated,

47
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,640
educated enough to understand that you have to look at things that are available.

48
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:14,400
That's very rare, unfortunately. If the press and the media are still acting

49
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,880
as mediators between all that information out there and people who are kind of tuning into

50
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:29,040
either mass read or mass watch stuff, does the media and the press need to do more

51
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,840
to actually increase the range of stories that they tell, or is social media enough

52
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,120
that it's up to each of us to find out that information? Because not everybody is bothered

53
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,840
to wake up in the morning and even listen to the news. Never mind. Go and search it out.

54
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,960
Well, just talk about myself. The first thing I do in the morning when I get up is read the New

55
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:04,000
York Times and the Washington Post two national newspapers, two national newspapers. That's

56
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,440
important. There used to be lots of newspapers, so there were local high-quality newspapers.

57
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:18,880
I lived in Boston most of my life. Boston Globe was a pretty substantial paper, had some of the

58
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:25,920
best reporting, not only domestically, but also internationally, had the best coverage in the

59
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:34,400
country of the Central America Wars in the 1980s. Actually, the editor was personal friends. Some

60
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:44,400
of the reporters were gone. Now it's wire service and local news. Same with all over the country,

61
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:51,760
Detroit Free Press, San Francisco Chronicle, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune,

62
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:59,520
the newspapers have radically constricted. What happened is that the business model

63
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:08,240
could not survive the internet. The business model for the media is basically advertising.

64
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:17,600
So the media are businesses that sell a product, you and me, to other businesses. It's their

65
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:25,280
central structure that collapsed with the shift of advertising to the internet. One major effect

66
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:32,720
is radical reduction of the available information in the press. It's had the same effect on the

67
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:39,120
major press as well. They've constricted. It takes me much less time to read the New York Times today

68
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:48,640
than it did 30 or 40 years ago because it's constrained, limited. Well, all these are serious

69
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:58,000
effects of basically the capitalist institutional structure, which imposes a certain constraint

70
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,840
on the nature of media. Could be changed by public media. Actually, they've declined too,

71
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:14,240
but it's not an issue in the United States because we don't have them. That's no BBC, no German

72
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:21,760
national television. The reason for that is a difference between the United States and other

73
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:28,000
state capitalist societies. The United States has a very powerful business class,

74
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:37,280
class conscience, constantly fighting a savage class war. This showed up with the media, showed

75
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:47,120
up with radio in the 1920s, early 30s. There were attempts to popular attempts, popular groups,

76
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:54,080
political groups, church groups, others to try to create national media, public media,

77
00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:01,600
that would respond to interests of the general population was defeated by a corporate opinion

78
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,200
to turn it into private media. Same thing happened with television 20 years later.

79
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:17,120
A result in the United States is essentially no public media margin, even that is corporate funding.

80
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:26,240
That's lost. You have to find other means to try to get out of the institutional factors

81
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:36,960
based on particular forms of savage capitalism, state capitalism that are constraining the

82
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:45,920
means of information available. Now, they are there. You can go to the internet and find out

83
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:56,080
quite a lot. I just think that that's a special for a marginal part of the population, even among

84
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:04,480
the educated classes, very few do it. While we're talking about the media, can we talk about Fox News?

85
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:13,200
Can we talk about Dominion voting systems with their defamation case? There nearly seems to be

86
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:18,560
more written about Rupert Murdoch who's going to get married again than there is written about the

87
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:25,680
actual case and the arguments that are going on in court. Should we be surprised that actually

88
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:31,520
that certainly over on this side of the Atlantic, it's getting reported but just a little.

89
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,840
It's not a big story, whereas it could have big implications for Fox News. It could have big

90
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:45,840
implications for your next presidential election. I doubt that it'll have much one effect. First

91
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:52,160
of all, Fox News is not a news channel. It's an echo chamber for the far right.

92
00:11:53,840 --> 00:12:00,720
You're familiar with that in England. The Murdoch system is not interested in providing

93
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:10,160
news to people. It's providing echo chambers for far right propaganda. Fox News is kind of

94
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:17,920
interesting. I look at it sometimes just to see how wild and extremely far right can be. It's kind

95
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:23,760
of amusing. Sometimes I actually tell you the truth. They're a little more open in some respects

96
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:31,680
than the major media. For example, personal experience. I've had interviews and discussion

97
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:43,280
on Fox News, not in the major media. That would be very, very rare. I suspect that this scandal,

98
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:55,200
the court case, will blow over somehow and they'll have the same role in the coming period of

99
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:04,720
political confrontations. Do you still value, even if you don't see it as a news channel,

100
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:11,840
do you still value it as part of the plurality of outlets telling the same stories in different

101
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:26,080
ways? Is it still valuable to have it there? Well, frankly, I don't see much value in having a

102
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:32,320
pure propaganda channel. You live in Russia. Yes, that's what you have, but I don't think we need it.

103
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:39,920
What we need is to strengthen, expand the actual media system. So, for example,

104
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:56,160
there were serious and other ways of public support. There aren't technical means to do that.

105
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,680
There are people actually working on it, like Robert Bobman Chesney,

106
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,080
who is a scholar at the University of Illinois. I'm just trying to reconstruct

107
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:22,160
significant local media system, also the level of national media. But the main point is, the main

108
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:29,440
goal is educating people to recognize that there are things you have to understand about the world,

109
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:36,400
and you're not going to find them from a limited, even a limited media system, certainly not from

110
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:42,560
social media. Now, this goes back to questions about what's happening to the whole social order.

111
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:50,240
Why aren't people getting together to look at these things? They used to. One reason is there

112
00:14:50,240 --> 00:15:00,480
used to be something called unions, labor unions. Labor unions were not just ways of raising wages.

113
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:10,880
They were cultural educational institutions. Adult education was a core part of the union

114
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:18,800
programs. Unions are places where people could get together, discuss, study, cultural events,

115
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:27,280
Reagan and Thatcher or their advisors were very sensible when they launched the

116
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:34,960
neoliberal assault against the population. First move, destroy the unions, the one way that people

117
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:43,120
have to have to protect and defend themselves. That was very effective. New labor Clinton,

118
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:49,920
they gave their own support to it. Now it's pretty much

119
00:15:51,520 --> 00:16:03,680
on the United States almost gone. Another modes of intercommunication, when people you get atomization,

120
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:16,400
isolation, easy prey to demagogues of the Trump variety, to fake news organizations like the

121
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:26,320
Murdoch media. People that don't have the means of self-defense that they had when they were

122
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:34,320
organized, could interact with one another, mutual support, solidarity, common goals and so on.

123
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:40,240
It's very interesting to see how powerful the efforts are to destroy this.

124
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:49,920
Just saw a remarkable case in England with the Corbyn phenomenon. Corbyn broke with this

125
00:16:50,880 --> 00:17:01,840
long-term policy pursued by the Tory government and the Blair right new labor. What he did was

126
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:10,640
a real crime. He tried to create a labor party that would be a participatory party

127
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:18,240
and would respond to the needs and concerns of working people and the poor and it was very

128
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:30,000
successful. 2017, they were under his influence when the biggest victory they had, as far back as

129
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:38,880
you can imagine, the whole establishment came down on him like a ton of bricks from the right wing

130
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:46,400
over to the Guardian and have this. We cannot have an authentic political party

131
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:56,800
that will break with domination by a small elite committed to the rich and powerful.

132
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:06,000
You know what happened? It was charges of total fakery about anti-Semitism. It was all exposed.

133
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,400
You could read the extensive exposure and held to zero again, but even the Labor Party's own

134
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:20,480
commission looking into it exposed it as a fraud. No effect. Now, this is too important. We cannot

135
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:27,680
allow a development like that. That might lead to a functioning democratic society.

136
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:35,040
We don't want that. This is a society which must be in the hands of the rich and the powerful.

137
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:44,880
We are fighting a constant class war, no break from that. It's very striking. Something similar

138
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:52,320
happened in the United States, less extreme, with the Democratic party, the Clintonite party

139
00:18:53,200 --> 00:19:00,880
moving along with the media to try to crush the Sanders phenomenon. It wasn't as extreme as in England,

140
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:08,000
but it had the effect of pretty much marginalizing the popular forces.

141
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,680
I suspect there are those who are members of the Labor Party in the UK who would dispute

142
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:24,800
your conclusion, but it does point to a difficulty when a party wants to change quickly,

143
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:32,080
when it wants to either go back to old values or new values. That seems a very difficult thing

144
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,640
for them to achieve. Is that going to be difficult for the Republican party to achieve if it wants

145
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,800
not to have Trump or if the Democrats want to reinvent? They don't seem terribly sure what

146
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:48,160
their ideology is at the moment. They're searching in terms of their policies. They're not selling

147
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:56,160
them well. I don't think that's the issue. It's very easy for a Republican to change. Let's take

148
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:05,360
the Republican Party in the United States. 2008, the Republican candidate for president was John

149
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:16,240
McCain. The most important issue in human affairs is the environmental crisis, which is going to

150
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,520
destroy organized human life on earth. That's the most important issue in history.

151
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:31,360
Well, 2008, the Republican Party did begin to move towards a small, limited climate program.

152
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:43,840
Not much, but something. McCain had a climate most part of the platform,

153
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:49,920
congressional Republicans were looking into things. The Koch brothers energy conglomerate,

154
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:59,840
huge conglomerate, which had been working for years to try to ensure that there was no interference

155
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:06,080
with their campaign to destroy organized human life on earth. When they, as soon as the Republican

156
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:14,960
Party began to shift immediately, they launched an enormous juggernaut intimidation, bribery,

157
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:23,360
threats, massive lobbying, asterisks, or asterisk organizations. The Republican Party turned on

158
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:33,440
a dime. They all turned total denialism. It's very easy to change a party's direction if you have

159
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:42,800
massive capital working for savage class war, plenty of other cases. So the issue is not

160
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:52,400
difficulty of changing. The problem was the kind of change that Corbyn was trying to bring about,

161
00:21:53,280 --> 00:22:02,400
a change to a labor party that would be a participatory party and concerned with the needs

162
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:10,160
of its constituents. And even worse than that, what was their success? Couldn't be tolerated.

163
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:17,280
Yes, there are people in Cure Starmer's party who will object to what I'm saying, but I'm afraid

164
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:24,480
it's the truth. When it comes to the next presidential election on your side of the Atlantic,

165
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,880
can America cope with another four years of Trump or another four years of Biden?

166
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:43,680
Well, the Republican Party really shouldn't be called a party anymore. I'd prefer the terms used by

167
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:52,960
the political analysts of the conservative American Enterprise Institute who refer to it as a radical

168
00:22:52,960 --> 00:23:00,480
insurgency that has abandoned parliamentary politics. That's pretty accurate. If you look at

169
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:08,080
international rankings of attitudes and so on, the Republican Party, if you want to call it that,

170
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:16,320
ranks alongside the far-right parties in Europe with neo-fascist origins. And they've totally

171
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:22,400
abandoned parliamentary politics. All you have to do is look at their programs. It's not even a joke.

172
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:31,360
Program is block anything, anything that might harm profit and power of the very rich in the

173
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:37,440
corporate sector. But right at the moment, sometimes it's almost comical, right at the moment,

174
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:45,440
now that they've taken over the House, lead program, prevent the internal revenues

175
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:54,240
service from checking tax cheats. That's their main program. Who are the tax cheats? Working people

176
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:02,000
who file their income tax, rich and powerful, who have a battery of corporate lawyers who figure

177
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:10,800
out a way not to pay taxes. The top program prevent the internet internally IRS from investigating

178
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:20,800
them. Take a look at Trump's legislative programs. One achievement, a massive tax cut for the very

179
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:30,400
rich in the corporate sector, stabbing everyone else in the back. Lead, a top issue for the

180
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:39,120
Republican Party is don't touch the tax cut. The Biden administration came in with a

181
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:45,440
moderately decent, not enough, but some kind of climate program. Actually,

182
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:53,600
pretty significant advance over earlier ones, which is not saying much. Cut back point by point,

183
00:24:53,600 --> 00:25:03,840
step by step, by 100% Republican opposition. Not a single Republican would break ranks to say,

184
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:10,480
let's do something about a climate problem which they know perfectly well has come and destroyed

185
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,520
human civilization. Well, that's not a political party.

186
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:24,960
You mentioned earlier in terms of social media and the bubbles and that we naturally end up in

187
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:31,920
hearing more of what we already believe. Why can that not be weaponized by those who want change?

188
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:38,640
Because you could argue either with unions and that there are ways of people online

189
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:45,760
finding kindred spirits, lobbying, kind of building up power, or you could say in terms of

190
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:52,000
challenging political parties around climate change. Why are those tools that are free and

191
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,840
available not being weaponized by those who want to actually challenge those with power,

192
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:03,760
those with corporate interests? Why is there not a grassroots revolution? What stops that?

193
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:13,440
Well, it's not so easy to form a grassroots movement. You're against concentrated

194
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:20,880
state and private power. When you try to do it, take a look at what happened to Corbyn.

195
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:28,240
Take a look at what happened to the Republican Party when it started to veer slightly towards

196
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,920
environment. Take a look at what's happened to the labor movement.

197
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,040
Not for, in fact, you can ask yourself another question. Take a look at what happened. Take

198
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:48,960
the United States, which is the leading in the lead in the neoliberal assault against the world,

199
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:56,800
against the population. Well, there's measures of what's happened. The Miranda Corporation,

200
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:03,280
very respectable quasi-governmental research corporation, did a study of the

201
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:13,440
general economic effects of the neoliberal period. Over 40 years, they found,

202
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:21,680
they studied what they called a lightly transfer of wealth, highway robbery to be more exact,

203
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:29,840
transfer of wealth from the working class and the middle class, lower 90% of the population

204
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:42,560
transferred to the top 1%, $50 trillion in 40 years. That's very effective class war.

205
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:51,600
Well, you have concentrated economic power on one side, largely controlling the state. You have

206
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:59,120
general population on the other side when there are efforts to make some moves. Concentrated power

207
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:08,560
comes down on them very hard for the unions, Corbyn efforts, Sanders efforts, Lyman.

208
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:19,520
You can fight against it. Over the centuries, there's been many victories. We don't have slavery.

209
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:27,440
We don't have a few laws. There are victories, but they're hard to win. You have to recall,

210
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:35,920
remember that those with, go back to Adam Smith at the beginning of the early days of the

211
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:45,520
capitalist industrial revolution. I was an astute observer. He pointed out that in all ages,

212
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:55,520
the masters of mankind pursue their vile maxim, all for ourselves, nothing for anyone else.

213
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:02,800
Well, that was in the early stages. Now it's much more organized and controlled and so on,

214
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:09,600
but the vile maxim still prevails, and you can see its consequences. You can fight against it.

215
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:16,400
There have been victories, lots of victories even in recent years, but it's a struggle,

216
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:21,120
and you're not going to win unless you recognize what the nature of the struggle is.

217
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:30,160
Another threat might be cyber war. We've mentioned a few threats in the last few minutes.

218
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,760
One of the speakers at the festival yesterday talked about the possibility that China might

219
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:42,560
try and invade Taiwan. He suggested that militarily that could probably be defended,

220
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:47,760
but the consequence would be that China might unleash a cyber war on the west

221
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:55,440
that we couldn't defend against. Does that technological war worry you? Is that on your list

222
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:03,360
of things that are challenging humanity along with nuclear power and climate change and ordinary

223
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:12,480
war and so on? Well, we have to bear in mind that the world's major propaganda system in the United

224
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:21,520
States, which also has an enormous effect on Britain, largely the satellite of the United

225
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:30,400
States by now, one of its main themes is you have to hate China, critical, yellow peril,

226
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,960
so we have to be very worried about China invading Taiwan. Is there any sign of that?

227
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:45,680
There's some good point to build up of military in the area, exercises that are going very close

228
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:56,640
to airspace. Military exercises largely in response to US provocation. So when there is

229
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:06,880
a policy called the One China Policy, it's been in place for 50 years, was settled in the 1970s.

230
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:16,880
The policy is US and China agree that Taiwan is part of China and both agree to what was called

231
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:26,320
strategic ambiguity. We don't say it in words, but we agree that we will do nothing to disrupt

232
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:38,000
this program by threats to challenging. Who's been challenging it? China's not a saintly power,

233
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:45,680
there's plenty you can preserve. But in reality, in this case, it's the US that's been provoking it,

234
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:56,800
partly just militarily. The official US policy is quoting it to encircle China

235
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:06,960
with a ring of sentinel states with advanced weapons, advanced precision weapons aimed at China,

236
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:24,240
South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Guam, Australia, all surrounding China to encircle and constrain it.

237
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:33,040
In the case of Taiwan, the US has been regularly breaking the strategic ambiguity.

238
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:42,480
So when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi went to Taiwan, that was saying we're breaking the

239
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:51,760
arrangements. China did respond, as you described, with naval maneuvers, to indicate that it can,

240
00:32:51,760 --> 00:33:00,240
if it wants, blockade Taiwan. This has continued. Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed the

241
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:10,560
Taiwan Policy Act, which says that Taiwan has to be treated as a normal non-nado ally with normal

242
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:22,080
diplomatic relations, weapon systems, interoperability of weapons, and so on. China reacts by carrying

243
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:31,520
out symbolic actions in the region around China. Those are not the only naval actions.

244
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:38,560
There are others that you didn't mention, like RIMPAC, enormous naval operations run by the

245
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:45,440
United States and its allies threatening China. But we don't talk about that. Since we own and

246
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:51,600
run the world, what we do is fine. We have to worry about it. We have to concentrate on people

247
00:33:51,600 --> 00:34:00,720
who are violating the rules we establish. Right now, the United States has openly, publicly

248
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:11,120
declared an economic war with China to try to prevent it from developing the advanced technologies

249
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:18,480
that we need for the modern age. It's not a secret. You read about it in the London Financial Times,

250
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:28,400
which describes it correctly as a war against China. China is reacting now by things like

251
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:36,000
the initiatives to bring Saudi Arabia and Iran together to overcome that conflict and to throw

252
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:44,560
wrench in U.S. policy of dominating the Middle East through an alliance of reactionary states

253
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:51,680
called the Abraham Accord, including Saudi Arabia as a central, not a literal, but

254
00:34:51,680 --> 00:35:00,960
partner, aimed at U.S. enemy Iran. China is disrupting that to blow to U.S. and Israel.

255
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:09,200
So, yes, these things are happening in the world. But if we're within inside the U.S.

256
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:17,440
propaganda bubble, as Britain mostly is, then, of course, we have to hate China and talk about

257
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:22,400
all the terrible things that China might be doing, but not talk about what we're doing,

258
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,640
because that's quite proper and appropriate since we own the world.

259
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:34,240
You have spoken out, if we kind of move to Russia and Ukraine, you have spoken out

260
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:41,440
and cautioned against how people view NATO. You have, I think, kind of reminded people

261
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:50,640
that they need to look at NATO without kind of, without looking through rose-tinted glasses.

262
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:55,440
So they need to kind of be careful how they view Russia, but also careful how they view NATO.

263
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,800
And I think you've talked about the fact that kind of negotiation should be happening, that

264
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:07,120
the U.S. should be promoting peace negotiations and so on. Do you see any evidence of that?

265
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:13,920
And do you think a modern war could be ended through negotiation, rather than having one

266
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:23,520
winner and one loser? Right now, the positions of the opposing parties

267
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:32,160
are, look, irreconcilable on paper, but that's where diplomacy and negotiations enter.

268
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:37,840
You see if you can make moves towards overcoming it, and there are proposals.

269
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:48,240
An article in the current issue of the Monte Diplomatique by two Finnish diplomats talks about

270
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:53,600
means you could use. Well, right now, the United States has an official position,

271
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:00,320
and Britain, as a loyal satellite of the United States, simply repeats the position.

272
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:06,960
The position is, we must continue the war in order to severely weaken Russia.

273
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:15,440
That's the official U.S. position. Basically, the U.S. imposed it on NATO. NATO, incidentally,

274
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,880
is now a Pacific power. Of course, the United States, at the latest summit meeting,

275
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:27,280
determined that NATO must support the United States' confrontation with China and the Pacific.

276
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:37,920
But the U.S. position is perfectly explicit. No diplomacy until, because we must severely

277
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:43,680
weaken Russia. Now, if you look at it, the United States is getting a bargain.

278
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:53,360
Not a big secret. It's discussed in Chatham House by U.S. commentators. For a small portion

279
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:02,400
of the U.S. colossal military budget, it's severely degrading the military forces of its own

280
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:08,640
only military adversary. That's a bargain. The United States is getting another bargain.

281
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:15,120
Putin's invasion of Ukraine is, of course, criminal aggression.

282
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:23,040
Major war crime. Also, an act of criminal stupidity from his point of view. It gave the

283
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:32,960
United States its most welcome gift on a silver platter. Europe drove Europe into the pocket of

284
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:40,640
the United States. It was an alternative. Combination between Europe and the East. Very

285
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:49,200
natural. The continental Europe has a very effective industrial system, German-based

286
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:56,560
industrial system, complex system. It's based very heavily on the relations with their natural

287
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:02,800
commercial partner to the East. Russia doesn't have much of an economy. It's about at the level

288
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:11,920
of Mexico. It has rich resources, raw materials, not just oil, petroleum, but minerals, and so on.

289
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:21,120
It's a path to the China market, enormous China market. In fact, the major EU market.

290
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:30,320
One possibility for Putin was to accept efforts at accommodation, which were, in fact, presented

291
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:37,680
regularly, particularly by Emmanuel Macron, telephone conversations up to a couple of

292
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:46,000
days before the invasion. Not interested in wanting to drive Europe into the US pocket.

293
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:53,200
Well, for Europe, that's pretty serious. Europe, while the United States is gaining enormously

294
00:39:53,200 --> 00:40:00,000
from the war, not just financially in terms of military power, but even geopolitically

295
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:09,440
with Europe now subordinated to it, Europe is facing a serious problem. Economist Magazine

296
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:16,880
points out that Europe is facing a kind of the industrialization, not just from its break,

297
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:23,680
from its commercial partners to the East, but even with regard to China. So part of the

298
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:34,240
US war against China is to compel other countries, European countries, to break their relations

299
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:42,720
with the China market. Pretty serious. Take a look at the Netherlands as the world's most advanced

300
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:50,800
lithographic industry, which produces essential parts for computer chips,

301
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:58,960
to semiconductors, and so on. The United States is ordering them, lose your main market, China.

302
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:07,680
Will they agree? We don't know. Ordering Samsung in South Korea to do the same thing.

303
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:14,400
You lose your main market, because we don't want China to develop. Same in Japan.

304
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:24,320
Will they accept it? Open question. Let's go back to crime. Just look at logic for a moment.

305
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:33,520
Either the war will be a stalemate and continue indefinitely, or it'll be settled.

306
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:42,320
Can't argue about that. That's logic. Well, if it's a stalemate, Ukraine is going to suffer

307
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:49,120
miserably. It's already being severely harmed to military forces,

308
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:57,840
badly harmed, economy severely harmed. Go on with the stalemate, it'll get much worse.

309
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:04,880
Russia will be harmed too, but too much more. Substantial society will probably survive it.

310
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:11,760
That's if there's a stalemate. Alternative to a stalemate, one of two possibilities.

311
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:20,000
Either one side capitulates, or there's a negotiated settlement. Well, Russia is not

312
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:27,840
going to capitulate. That's pretty clear. The alternative is a negotiated settlement,

313
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:37,520
diplomacy. Who's in favor of it? Who's against it? The United States and its British satellite

314
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:45,920
are against it. We must continue the war to weaken Russia. In fact, that happened dramatically

315
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:55,440
last March. There were negotiations underway between Ukraine and Russia under Turkish auspices.

316
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:03,440
Boris Johnson, who was then the prime minister, flew to Kyiv and informed the Ukrainians that

317
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:10,240
Britain and the United States don't think this is the time for negotiations. He was followed by

318
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:18,240
US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, the Western media don't cover this. It's not a proper topic

319
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:24,800
for them, but apparently he gave his usual message of no negotiations. Now I have to

320
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:30,560
continue with the war. Well, the negotiations crashed. We don't actually know the reasons

321
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:36,720
there's very little coverage, but that was probably part of it at least. But the US and Britain

322
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:46,400
persist in saying we must continue the war to weaken Russia. Now there is an official

323
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:54,400
version of this. It says we must continue the war so that Ukraine will be in a better negotiating

324
00:43:54,400 --> 00:44:01,440
position. Does that make sense? Ukraine's going to be in a worse negotiation position,

325
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:10,080
suffering badly. So let's tell the truth. We have to fight the war, continue the war,

326
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:17,200
to weaken Russia, strengthen ourselves at the cost of everyone else, mainly Ukrainians.

327
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:25,120
Well, how does the world react to this? The world says we don't want it. Almost the entire world

328
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:32,080
opposes this position. Check back at the Munich Strategic Conference a couple of weeks ago,

329
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:39,200
the International Conference. The United States made every effort to try to bring

330
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:49,600
the global south into support for the US campaign in Ukraine. Nobody, not India,

331
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:57,840
not Indonesia, not long-time US allies like Colombia, Brazil. They all said no.

332
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:05,440
What they said is this is a proxy war between you and Russia. We don't have any part of it.

333
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:12,240
We're certainly not going to pay attention to the bombast that comes out of the British and

334
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:19,040
American media and propaganda system about fighting a noble war for democracy.

335
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:26,320
We've had enough experience with you to know what that means, hundreds of years of experience.

336
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:33,200
So keep your bombast and pretentiousness for yourselves. We're looking at the actual world.

337
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:38,800
We don't want to be part of this. We would like to see a diplomatic settlement that will end the

338
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:47,840
horrors before they get worse. Take continental Europe. There's a difference between a lead opinion

339
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,480
and public opinion. We have polls. These are free countries.

340
00:45:53,440 --> 00:46:02,560
Polls show strong support for negotiation and diplomacy. The educated classes, the media say,

341
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:10,960
no, we have to go along with the US-British no negotiations policy. That's the way the world

342
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:17,520
is dividing up. Well, what does this mean for Ukraine? Just think through the logic and just

343
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:25,840
plain logic. Russia is not going to capitulate. Ukraine is not going to get in a better negotiating

344
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:33,600
position. Either there will be some kind of stalemate, which will be devastating for Ukraine,

345
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:40,960
very dangerous in other respects, arms, millions of people in the world because of

346
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:50,400
the curtailing of grain and fertilizer exports. Very significant threat of escalation to major war.

347
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:58,560
So far, Russia has not emulated the US-British war style of war.

348
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:11,360
President Biden, Janet Yellen, other officials have visited Kyiv. Do you remember anybody who

349
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:19,920
visited Baghdad when the US and Britain were pounding at the dust? Remember anybody? No.

350
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:26,480
In fact, the few peace volunteers who were there were ordered out of the country because the United

351
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:34,880
States and Britain were smashing it up properly. That's a difference. It might move to expand the

352
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:43,600
war to the US-British style, go after the jugular, destroy communications, destroy energy,

353
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:53,760
destroy transportation, destroy everything that allows the country to function, go after

354
00:47:53,760 --> 00:48:01,760
Western Ukraine with a vengeance, attack supply routes, presumably leave you in the confrontation

355
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:09,520
with NATO. Then what happens? Now it's tanks. It's beginning with jet planes. Next will be a

356
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:16,640
further escalation. The Ukrainians are the ones who'll suffer most, but the rest of the world is

357
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:24,800
also facing a problem. Well, the Ukrainians make their own decisions. What they decide,

358
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:32,240
we should support. They have a right to defend themselves. But we have our own countries to

359
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:42,960
care about. We are responsible for US, British, Irish, German policy. People of the countries

360
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:50,960
are responsible for it. I'm in the United States. Should we support a policy that says,

361
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:58,320
let's continue to fight the war, no matter how devastating the effect in order to severely

362
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:07,360
weaken Russia? No, I don't think so. We should stop the campaign to block negotiations and diplomacy.

363
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:14,480
Can they succeed? You don't know unless they try. They'll try. Of course, they don't succeed.

364
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:22,640
If there were to be a negotiated settlement or to be negotiations, could the result ever be

365
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:29,120
just from a Ukrainian point of view? Is that just a moral?

366
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:36,800
Diplomatic settlements. Diplomatic settlements almost by definition are not just a diplomatic

367
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:43,760
settlement as one which all sides accept reluctantly because none of them get their

368
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:50,880
maximum objectives, but they see that as the best of the possible outcomes or at least the least

369
00:49:50,880 --> 00:50:04,000
worse. That's the nature of diplomatic settlements. If you don't want that, let's escalate to total

370
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:13,920
destruction. Yeah. We've about 10 minutes left. I'm going to come to a couple of questions from

371
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:19,120
people who are watching in a minute, but maybe if we could look at, I suppose, the rise of the

372
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:24,320
algorithm, the rise of those things. We've touched on it with social media, but we have

373
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:31,600
news this week, I think, that in France for the Paris Olympics, facial recognition will be allowed

374
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:37,840
on a so-called temporary basis until the end of the Olympics. What is temporary often becomes

375
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:45,440
very permanent. We've also got things like chat GPT, the so-called artificial intelligence chatbot

376
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:52,400
that can take your question and go off and give you a bit of an answer. What do you think about

377
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:59,520
that kind of our reliance on machines to make decisions? If you like taking the human out of

378
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:05,840
the loop, is that a danger or is that just part of technology? It's part of just modernizing,

379
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:11,600
and every technology has its good sides and its bad sides. Do these things particularly worry you?

380
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:26,640
For example, there's some of the crazier proposals are that the systems of automatic

381
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:39,280
warning of missile attacks should be automated to death sentence. We've had 70 years of experience

382
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:49,040
of virtual, coming very close to terminal nuclear war because the systems that

383
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:59,680
of our design carefully sophisticated way to determine if there's some say enemy missile attack

384
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:09,760
have failed and human intervention was necessary to prevent the end termination of human life on

385
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:21,600
earth. It's going to get worse if you automate them further. What has saved us so far is human

386
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:29,120
intervention. Several, I don't have to go through the details, but there were several cases that

387
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:35,760
are well known where Russian officials just refused to accept the information that was coming in,

388
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:41,920
just didn't hand it on to the higher authorities. That's why we're alive. Hotlines are useful things

389
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:50,320
for humans to talk to each other. It wasn't even a hunt. It was just a middle level official saying

390
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:57,280
this can't be real. I'm not going to send it on. It was one during the Cuban Missile Crisis when

391
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:04,640
Russian submarines were under attack by US destroyers. They thought they'd lost contact with

392
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:10,880
central authorities, thought a war was on. Commander decided we might as well launch our

393
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:17,920
torpedoes, which happened to be nuclear tipped, would have ended everything because of the reaction.

394
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:28,080
One officer, Vasily Akhapov, decided to veto it. So we're now talking.

395
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:35,520
There was a case when Defense Secretary William Perry was almost on the phone,

396
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:42,240
called President Carter, to tell him that the sophisticated US warning systems that

397
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:48,640
detected a Russian attack, he had now a couple minutes to respond. He got a call from the

398
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:55,280
central official, the monitoring official, said we made a computer error. Hold it off.

399
00:53:56,080 --> 00:54:02,480
You want to go into that kind of system? Okay. But let's not have a look. First of all, we're very

400
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:09,920
incredible. These are all human decisions. There's no technology forcing anything, nothing.

401
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:19,360
We have to remember that the propaganda and the hype about these systems vastly exceeds the reality.

402
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:26,960
You can read all sorts of excited articles in the newspapers, papers about

403
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:40,560
chatbot being surpassing human intelligence. Are they sentient? This is total nonsense.

404
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:46,480
This is basically high-tech plagiarism. You look into the nature of the systems,

405
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:53,760
they're designed in such a way that in principle, they can tell you absolutely nothing about

406
00:54:54,640 --> 00:55:01,600
language, learning, cognition, and so on. They're doing something else. Nice toys, if you like.

407
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:08,480
But no constructive purpose that anyone can think of. But they are dangerous. There are already

408
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:15,520
cases. There was an article in the Washington Post a couple days ago about one case in which a

409
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:24,960
something like a chatbot system, which was combined with artificial image creation,

410
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:30,240
which is not that difficult these days, which was used for a major defamation project.

411
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:36,320
Well, we're going to see more and that more and more of that. These are wonderful techniques for

412
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:44,400
defamation, for disinformation. When bots get involved with powerful systems behind them,

413
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:52,720
like states can be a major danger. They should certainly be concerned about that.

414
00:55:53,440 --> 00:56:03,280
But as far as taking over, doing all kind of scary things, that's us, not them.

415
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:09,520
I might be dealing with this quickly, but if a question comes in, you've mentioned

416
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:16,400
Washington Post, the New York Times, your morning routine of finding news from different places.

417
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:21,200
Algae Zero, you've mentioned a few times. A question in that says, what are some of the

418
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:27,440
important places that people might look for information that gives them a balance? Should

419
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:36,240
they be looking at Brit Parts and the Daily Mail and Fox News as well as what you might

420
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:40,640
see as more reputable, more impartial places? Or should they stick to kind of a set of places?

421
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:45,360
Is there a list you have in mind of places you enjoy finding out things?

422
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:53,920
There's no such thing as impartial. I'm not impartial. You're not impartial. You should

423
00:56:53,920 --> 00:57:00,720
understand it. You should be honest. It says, here's my view of the world. Understand it.

424
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:09,920
Interpret what I'm saying on the basis of my own perception of how the world works.

425
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:15,920
That's what the newspapers should be doing. Not saying I'm unbiased and neutral because

426
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:22,720
they're not. Nobody is. Let's be honest about what we are. I try to be. You try to be.

427
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:29,760
Talk to an audience. I say, here's the way I view the world. You don't have to accept it.

428
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:36,400
Just see if it makes sense or not to you. Now, if you look at the media, if I was in,

429
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:42,800
I say London, if I went on to spend time in London, the first thing to do in the morning

430
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:51,120
is pick up half of these major newspapers. The media environment is different from the

431
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:57,120
United States. You have to read half a dozen newspapers to get some degree of coverage.

432
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:05,600
But you do. There's scariest journalism. Journalists themselves, especially correspondence

433
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:10,720
on the ground, do excellent work. Honest, courageous, and learn a lot from them.

434
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:18,480
Read the major media. Read the business press, which is often very illuminating.

435
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:30,080
There are biases on their face. No problem. But financial times are very revealing material.

436
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:37,680
And then look for things that are of particular interest to you. There's no algorithms for it.

437
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:43,120
Too much goes on in the world to know everything. But what you're interested in,

438
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:49,200
you think are important pursuers. But don't get caught up in self-reinforcing bubbles.

439
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:56,880
And assume that what the major media are presenting is an accurate picture of the world.

440
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:04,960
They're presenting it from a certain perspective, which is largely subordinate to powerful,

441
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:12,800
to concentrated power in the private system and in the state system, which are closely related,

442
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:18,880
of course, in state-connected societies. So understand the nature of the institutions

443
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:26,560
and take a careful look with a critical eye. Recognize that we're fine journalists,

444
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:30,160
trustworthy, and so on. That's the way it can proceed.

445
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:34,640
I'm going to paraphrase one last question here from someone.

446
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:41,280
You speak a lot. You're very generous with your time to different groups and different audiences.

447
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:47,040
The danger of talking a lot is that there's a lot on record of what you've said.

448
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:53,920
Do you often change your mind on topics and things that you once thought you had worked out

449
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:59,280
and then think, you know, I've learned more, actually, it's a bit more nuanced than that?

450
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:03,680
Or are there things that you do kind of swing around on over time?

451
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,240
Learn things over time.

452
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:09,200
You're human after all.

453
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:17,680
You have a critical open mind. You're constantly criticizing yourself.

454
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:22,160
Did I understand this correctly? Is there something I should look at?

455
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:31,680
I should say that I'm pretty conservative in that respect. So my major conception of how the world

456
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:43,440
works hasn't changed much since I was 15 years old. Actually, the first article I wrote back in

457
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:54,880
1939 was a warning about at a 10-year-old level. I don't suggest anybody read it.

458
01:00:54,880 --> 01:01:00,080
What was a warning about the spread of fascism in Europe, which looked ominous at the time and

459
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:03,520
inexorable, still concerned about?

460
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:09,680
I think we're probably out of time. We've had an hour of your time this evening or

461
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:14,160
this afternoon for you. Noam Chomsky, you've been very generous with the festival over the years.

462
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:19,840
Thank you so much for dropping in again this year to help us think about ideas and politics.

463
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:25,280
For those who are watching at home, if you're in and about Belfast, tomorrow is the final day of

464
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:29,680
the festival. A few more events that you can kind of attend. If you're watching online,

465
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:33,440
if you click through to the YouTube channel for the festival, you can see some of the other

466
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:38,080
events we had this year and certainly a back catalogue of things over previous years,

467
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:41,760
including Noam Chomsky talking to William Crawley probably two years ago,

468
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:47,280
or maybe even a few years before that as well. But to close, thank you very much, sir, for your time.

469
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:50,800
Noam Chomsky, thank you and good night.

470
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:01,060
you
