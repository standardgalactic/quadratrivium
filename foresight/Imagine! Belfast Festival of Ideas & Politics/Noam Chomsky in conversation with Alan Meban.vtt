Hello and welcome to Imagine Belfast. I'm Alan Mabin and on this penultimate evening

00:12.120 --> 00:17.920
of the 2023 Festival, it's our Festival of Ideas and Politics. What better way, what

00:17.920 --> 00:23.640
better company could we have to spend it than with Noam Chomsky, renowned linguist, philosopher,

00:23.640 --> 00:28.200
political activist and public intellectual and over the years a great friend to this

00:28.200 --> 00:31.760
festival. Noam, you're very welcome back to Imagine Festival.

00:31.760 --> 00:36.320
Thank you very much. Pleased to be with you.

00:36.320 --> 00:42.840
I've been part of quite a few online conversations this week and one of the very common factors

00:42.840 --> 00:49.720
is that there have been stacks of books behind the people. Now tonight you have plants rather

00:49.720 --> 00:56.200
than books but in the past you might have had a good bookcase there. Do you fear that

00:56.200 --> 01:02.040
in the world of screens and so on that words on paper are starting to become less common

01:02.040 --> 01:04.680
by losing their value?

01:04.680 --> 01:12.120
Certainly and there are good measures of it. So there have been studies when going on for

01:12.120 --> 01:24.720
a long time. There have been studies of books that are assigned to young people in schools.

01:24.720 --> 01:35.040
Turns out that even 20, 30 years ago there was a tendency to assign to the high school

01:35.040 --> 01:41.880
students, 12th grade students that used books that used to be read in eighth grade. We get

01:41.880 --> 01:46.360
students coming into the university who don't know how to write an essay. They've never

01:46.360 --> 01:54.520
had that experience. Part of this is the effect of the so-called teaching to test movement

01:54.520 --> 02:02.280
of the last 20 years, Bush, Obama and so on. Part of it is just the decline in reading

02:02.280 --> 02:07.960
all together and it's getting worse. There was a study that just came out a couple days

02:07.960 --> 02:18.280
ago of the, I think it's called Generation Z, the people who were born after 1997, high

02:18.280 --> 02:26.120
school college students asking where do they get their so-called information? Almost none

02:26.120 --> 02:33.760
look at the newspapers, almost none look at television. They didn't stop looking at Facebook

02:33.760 --> 02:42.320
to old fashioned. They're getting their news from channels where kids are having fun dancing

02:42.320 --> 02:52.200
around. Of course, that's having an effect. The social media have other effects. They're

02:52.200 --> 03:01.080
tending to drive people into self-reinforcing bubbles. We're all subject to that. I am too.

03:01.080 --> 03:08.040
When I pick up and start looking at things in the morning, I don't look at Breitbart.

03:08.080 --> 03:16.000
I look at maybe Democracy Now or something like that and conversely, well, the media with all

03:16.000 --> 03:26.560
their limitations have a certain amount of range of discussion and debate limited, but some not

03:26.560 --> 03:32.760
the self-reinforcing bubbles and self-reinforcing is the crucial part. It means you don't get

03:32.760 --> 03:40.840
anything but enhancing your own beliefs and prejudices. Reading is declining along with it.

03:42.920 --> 03:50.040
When it comes to when you're working as an academic, there would be fewer of the journals

03:50.040 --> 03:55.880
that are available on paper, more of them are online, fewer books available on paper. Are you

03:55.920 --> 04:03.160
missing paper-based things? Do you soak in as much information when you're reading on a screen or

04:03.160 --> 04:12.520
have you got used to it? Well, there are plenty of fine books available, but the question is,

04:12.520 --> 04:20.960
do people access them? There's plenty of important information available on the screen. For example,

04:21.440 --> 04:28.240
I can sit in the United States, I can read the foreign press. You learn a lot from it. How many

04:28.240 --> 04:37.920
people do that? Virtually nobody. It's surprising if they even read the national press, let alone

04:39.120 --> 04:48.080
the foreign press. You learn a lot. Recently, I learned about a pretty incredible scandal,

04:48.800 --> 04:58.400
which is not reported here. This is called what aboutism? If you pardon it, I'll talk about the

04:58.400 --> 05:05.920
real world. I'm not allowed to talk about that. Take the invasion of Iraq. There were enormous

05:05.920 --> 05:13.200
atrocities. Some of the worst, most outlandish, outrageous atrocities were the destruction of

05:13.200 --> 05:23.200
Fallujah. Recently, a couple months ago, the US Navy just commissioned its latest assault vessel.

05:23.920 --> 05:32.400
It's called the USS Fallujah in commemoration of one of the most atrocious atrocities of the

05:32.400 --> 05:38.240
worst crime of the 20th century. I didn't learn about it here. I learned about it in Al Jazeera,

05:39.040 --> 05:45.440
where I could also read the reaction of the Iraqis to it, naturally outraged.

05:48.400 --> 05:56.320
That information is available in principle, but you have to be motivated, stimulated,

05:57.520 --> 06:02.640
educated enough to understand that you have to look at things that are available.

06:03.200 --> 06:14.400
That's very rare, unfortunately. If the press and the media are still acting

06:14.400 --> 06:20.880
as mediators between all that information out there and people who are kind of tuning into

06:20.880 --> 06:29.040
either mass read or mass watch stuff, does the media and the press need to do more

06:29.120 --> 06:35.840
to actually increase the range of stories that they tell, or is social media enough

06:35.840 --> 06:41.120
that it's up to each of us to find out that information? Because not everybody is bothered

06:41.120 --> 06:45.840
to wake up in the morning and even listen to the news. Never mind. Go and search it out.

06:48.000 --> 06:54.960
Well, just talk about myself. The first thing I do in the morning when I get up is read the New

06:54.960 --> 07:04.000
York Times and the Washington Post two national newspapers, two national newspapers. That's

07:04.000 --> 07:11.440
important. There used to be lots of newspapers, so there were local high-quality newspapers.

07:12.160 --> 07:18.880
I lived in Boston most of my life. Boston Globe was a pretty substantial paper, had some of the

07:18.880 --> 07:25.920
best reporting, not only domestically, but also internationally, had the best coverage in the

07:25.920 --> 07:34.400
country of the Central America Wars in the 1980s. Actually, the editor was personal friends. Some

07:34.400 --> 07:44.400
of the reporters were gone. Now it's wire service and local news. Same with all over the country,

07:44.400 --> 07:51.760
Detroit Free Press, San Francisco Chronicle, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune,

07:52.880 --> 07:59.520
the newspapers have radically constricted. What happened is that the business model

08:00.480 --> 08:08.240
could not survive the internet. The business model for the media is basically advertising.

08:08.960 --> 08:17.600
So the media are businesses that sell a product, you and me, to other businesses. It's their

08:17.600 --> 08:25.280
central structure that collapsed with the shift of advertising to the internet. One major effect

08:25.280 --> 08:32.720
is radical reduction of the available information in the press. It's had the same effect on the

08:32.800 --> 08:39.120
major press as well. They've constricted. It takes me much less time to read the New York Times today

08:39.120 --> 08:48.640
than it did 30 or 40 years ago because it's constrained, limited. Well, all these are serious

08:48.640 --> 08:58.000
effects of basically the capitalist institutional structure, which imposes a certain constraint

08:58.000 --> 09:03.840
on the nature of media. Could be changed by public media. Actually, they've declined too,

09:04.720 --> 09:14.240
but it's not an issue in the United States because we don't have them. That's no BBC, no German

09:14.240 --> 09:21.760
national television. The reason for that is a difference between the United States and other

09:21.760 --> 09:28.000
state capitalist societies. The United States has a very powerful business class,

09:28.800 --> 09:37.280
class conscience, constantly fighting a savage class war. This showed up with the media, showed

09:37.280 --> 09:47.120
up with radio in the 1920s, early 30s. There were attempts to popular attempts, popular groups,

09:47.200 --> 09:54.080
political groups, church groups, others to try to create national media, public media,

09:54.080 --> 10:01.600
that would respond to interests of the general population was defeated by a corporate opinion

10:01.600 --> 10:07.200
to turn it into private media. Same thing happened with television 20 years later.

10:08.160 --> 10:17.120
A result in the United States is essentially no public media margin, even that is corporate funding.

10:19.440 --> 10:26.240
That's lost. You have to find other means to try to get out of the institutional factors

10:26.320 --> 10:36.960
based on particular forms of savage capitalism, state capitalism that are constraining the

10:37.760 --> 10:45.920
means of information available. Now, they are there. You can go to the internet and find out

10:45.920 --> 10:56.080
quite a lot. I just think that that's a special for a marginal part of the population, even among

10:56.080 --> 11:04.480
the educated classes, very few do it. While we're talking about the media, can we talk about Fox News?

11:05.120 --> 11:13.200
Can we talk about Dominion voting systems with their defamation case? There nearly seems to be

11:13.280 --> 11:18.560
more written about Rupert Murdoch who's going to get married again than there is written about the

11:18.560 --> 11:25.680
actual case and the arguments that are going on in court. Should we be surprised that actually

11:25.680 --> 11:31.520
that certainly over on this side of the Atlantic, it's getting reported but just a little.

11:32.640 --> 11:37.840
It's not a big story, whereas it could have big implications for Fox News. It could have big

11:37.840 --> 11:45.840
implications for your next presidential election. I doubt that it'll have much one effect. First

11:45.840 --> 11:52.160
of all, Fox News is not a news channel. It's an echo chamber for the far right.

11:53.840 --> 12:00.720
You're familiar with that in England. The Murdoch system is not interested in providing

12:00.720 --> 12:10.160
news to people. It's providing echo chambers for far right propaganda. Fox News is kind of

12:10.160 --> 12:17.920
interesting. I look at it sometimes just to see how wild and extremely far right can be. It's kind

12:17.920 --> 12:23.760
of amusing. Sometimes I actually tell you the truth. They're a little more open in some respects

12:23.840 --> 12:31.680
than the major media. For example, personal experience. I've had interviews and discussion

12:31.680 --> 12:43.280
on Fox News, not in the major media. That would be very, very rare. I suspect that this scandal,

12:43.280 --> 12:55.200
the court case, will blow over somehow and they'll have the same role in the coming period of

12:55.200 --> 13:04.720
political confrontations. Do you still value, even if you don't see it as a news channel,

13:04.720 --> 13:11.840
do you still value it as part of the plurality of outlets telling the same stories in different

13:11.840 --> 13:26.080
ways? Is it still valuable to have it there? Well, frankly, I don't see much value in having a

13:26.720 --> 13:32.320
pure propaganda channel. You live in Russia. Yes, that's what you have, but I don't think we need it.

13:32.880 --> 13:39.920
What we need is to strengthen, expand the actual media system. So, for example,

13:48.640 --> 13:56.160
there were serious and other ways of public support. There aren't technical means to do that.

13:56.720 --> 14:01.680
There are people actually working on it, like Robert Bobman Chesney,

14:04.720 --> 14:10.080
who is a scholar at the University of Illinois. I'm just trying to reconstruct

14:13.280 --> 14:22.160
significant local media system, also the level of national media. But the main point is, the main

14:22.160 --> 14:29.440
goal is educating people to recognize that there are things you have to understand about the world,

14:29.440 --> 14:36.400
and you're not going to find them from a limited, even a limited media system, certainly not from

14:36.400 --> 14:42.560
social media. Now, this goes back to questions about what's happening to the whole social order.

14:43.200 --> 14:50.240
Why aren't people getting together to look at these things? They used to. One reason is there

14:50.240 --> 15:00.480
used to be something called unions, labor unions. Labor unions were not just ways of raising wages.

15:01.440 --> 15:10.880
They were cultural educational institutions. Adult education was a core part of the union

15:10.880 --> 15:18.800
programs. Unions are places where people could get together, discuss, study, cultural events,

15:20.480 --> 15:27.280
Reagan and Thatcher or their advisors were very sensible when they launched the

15:27.840 --> 15:34.960
neoliberal assault against the population. First move, destroy the unions, the one way that people

15:34.960 --> 15:43.120
have to have to protect and defend themselves. That was very effective. New labor Clinton,

15:43.120 --> 15:49.920
they gave their own support to it. Now it's pretty much

15:51.520 --> 16:03.680
on the United States almost gone. Another modes of intercommunication, when people you get atomization,

16:04.320 --> 16:16.400
isolation, easy prey to demagogues of the Trump variety, to fake news organizations like the

16:16.400 --> 16:26.320
Murdoch media. People that don't have the means of self-defense that they had when they were

16:26.400 --> 16:34.320
organized, could interact with one another, mutual support, solidarity, common goals and so on.

16:35.040 --> 16:40.240
It's very interesting to see how powerful the efforts are to destroy this.

16:41.440 --> 16:49.920
Just saw a remarkable case in England with the Corbyn phenomenon. Corbyn broke with this

16:50.880 --> 17:01.840
long-term policy pursued by the Tory government and the Blair right new labor. What he did was

17:03.120 --> 17:10.640
a real crime. He tried to create a labor party that would be a participatory party

17:11.440 --> 17:18.240
and would respond to the needs and concerns of working people and the poor and it was very

17:18.320 --> 17:30.000
successful. 2017, they were under his influence when the biggest victory they had, as far back as

17:30.000 --> 17:38.880
you can imagine, the whole establishment came down on him like a ton of bricks from the right wing

17:38.880 --> 17:46.400
over to the Guardian and have this. We cannot have an authentic political party

17:48.720 --> 17:56.800
that will break with domination by a small elite committed to the rich and powerful.

17:58.640 --> 18:06.000
You know what happened? It was charges of total fakery about anti-Semitism. It was all exposed.

18:06.000 --> 18:12.400
You could read the extensive exposure and held to zero again, but even the Labor Party's own

18:13.200 --> 18:20.480
commission looking into it exposed it as a fraud. No effect. Now, this is too important. We cannot

18:20.480 --> 18:27.680
allow a development like that. That might lead to a functioning democratic society.

18:28.320 --> 18:35.040
We don't want that. This is a society which must be in the hands of the rich and the powerful.

18:36.960 --> 18:44.880
We are fighting a constant class war, no break from that. It's very striking. Something similar

18:44.880 --> 18:52.320
happened in the United States, less extreme, with the Democratic party, the Clintonite party

18:53.200 --> 19:00.880
moving along with the media to try to crush the Sanders phenomenon. It wasn't as extreme as in England,

19:01.680 --> 19:08.000
but it had the effect of pretty much marginalizing the popular forces.

19:10.160 --> 19:15.680
I suspect there are those who are members of the Labor Party in the UK who would dispute

19:16.880 --> 19:24.800
your conclusion, but it does point to a difficulty when a party wants to change quickly,

19:25.440 --> 19:32.080
when it wants to either go back to old values or new values. That seems a very difficult thing

19:32.080 --> 19:36.640
for them to achieve. Is that going to be difficult for the Republican party to achieve if it wants

19:37.280 --> 19:42.800
not to have Trump or if the Democrats want to reinvent? They don't seem terribly sure what

19:42.800 --> 19:48.160
their ideology is at the moment. They're searching in terms of their policies. They're not selling

19:48.160 --> 19:56.160
them well. I don't think that's the issue. It's very easy for a Republican to change. Let's take

19:56.160 --> 20:05.360
the Republican Party in the United States. 2008, the Republican candidate for president was John

20:05.360 --> 20:16.240
McCain. The most important issue in human affairs is the environmental crisis, which is going to

20:16.320 --> 20:21.520
destroy organized human life on earth. That's the most important issue in history.

20:22.240 --> 20:31.360
Well, 2008, the Republican Party did begin to move towards a small, limited climate program.

20:32.000 --> 20:43.840
Not much, but something. McCain had a climate most part of the platform,

20:43.920 --> 20:49.920
congressional Republicans were looking into things. The Koch brothers energy conglomerate,

20:49.920 --> 20:59.840
huge conglomerate, which had been working for years to try to ensure that there was no interference

20:59.840 --> 21:06.080
with their campaign to destroy organized human life on earth. When they, as soon as the Republican

21:06.080 --> 21:14.960
Party began to shift immediately, they launched an enormous juggernaut intimidation, bribery,

21:14.960 --> 21:23.360
threats, massive lobbying, asterisks, or asterisk organizations. The Republican Party turned on

21:23.360 --> 21:33.440
a dime. They all turned total denialism. It's very easy to change a party's direction if you have

21:33.440 --> 21:42.800
massive capital working for savage class war, plenty of other cases. So the issue is not

21:45.040 --> 21:52.400
difficulty of changing. The problem was the kind of change that Corbyn was trying to bring about,

21:53.280 --> 22:02.400
a change to a labor party that would be a participatory party and concerned with the needs

22:02.400 --> 22:10.160
of its constituents. And even worse than that, what was their success? Couldn't be tolerated.

22:10.720 --> 22:17.280
Yes, there are people in Cure Starmer's party who will object to what I'm saying, but I'm afraid

22:17.280 --> 22:24.480
it's the truth. When it comes to the next presidential election on your side of the Atlantic,

22:25.840 --> 22:30.880
can America cope with another four years of Trump or another four years of Biden?

22:32.560 --> 22:43.680
Well, the Republican Party really shouldn't be called a party anymore. I'd prefer the terms used by

22:43.680 --> 22:52.960
the political analysts of the conservative American Enterprise Institute who refer to it as a radical

22:52.960 --> 23:00.480
insurgency that has abandoned parliamentary politics. That's pretty accurate. If you look at

23:00.560 --> 23:08.080
international rankings of attitudes and so on, the Republican Party, if you want to call it that,

23:08.080 --> 23:16.320
ranks alongside the far-right parties in Europe with neo-fascist origins. And they've totally

23:16.320 --> 23:22.400
abandoned parliamentary politics. All you have to do is look at their programs. It's not even a joke.

23:23.360 --> 23:31.360
Program is block anything, anything that might harm profit and power of the very rich in the

23:31.360 --> 23:37.440
corporate sector. But right at the moment, sometimes it's almost comical, right at the moment,

23:38.400 --> 23:45.440
now that they've taken over the House, lead program, prevent the internal revenues

23:46.240 --> 23:54.240
service from checking tax cheats. That's their main program. Who are the tax cheats? Working people

23:54.240 --> 24:02.000
who file their income tax, rich and powerful, who have a battery of corporate lawyers who figure

24:02.000 --> 24:10.800
out a way not to pay taxes. The top program prevent the internet internally IRS from investigating

24:11.760 --> 24:20.800
them. Take a look at Trump's legislative programs. One achievement, a massive tax cut for the very

24:20.800 --> 24:30.400
rich in the corporate sector, stabbing everyone else in the back. Lead, a top issue for the

24:30.400 --> 24:39.120
Republican Party is don't touch the tax cut. The Biden administration came in with a

24:40.080 --> 24:45.440
moderately decent, not enough, but some kind of climate program. Actually,

24:46.240 --> 24:53.600
pretty significant advance over earlier ones, which is not saying much. Cut back point by point,

24:53.600 --> 25:03.840
step by step, by 100% Republican opposition. Not a single Republican would break ranks to say,

25:04.480 --> 25:10.480
let's do something about a climate problem which they know perfectly well has come and destroyed

25:11.360 --> 25:15.520
human civilization. Well, that's not a political party.

25:17.520 --> 25:24.960
You mentioned earlier in terms of social media and the bubbles and that we naturally end up in

25:24.960 --> 25:31.920
hearing more of what we already believe. Why can that not be weaponized by those who want change?

25:32.560 --> 25:38.640
Because you could argue either with unions and that there are ways of people online

25:39.200 --> 25:45.760
finding kindred spirits, lobbying, kind of building up power, or you could say in terms of

25:46.320 --> 25:52.000
challenging political parties around climate change. Why are those tools that are free and

25:52.000 --> 25:57.840
available not being weaponized by those who want to actually challenge those with power,

25:57.920 --> 26:03.760
those with corporate interests? Why is there not a grassroots revolution? What stops that?

26:06.480 --> 26:13.440
Well, it's not so easy to form a grassroots movement. You're against concentrated

26:15.120 --> 26:20.880
state and private power. When you try to do it, take a look at what happened to Corbyn.

26:21.840 --> 26:28.240
Take a look at what happened to the Republican Party when it started to veer slightly towards

26:28.880 --> 26:31.920
environment. Take a look at what's happened to the labor movement.

26:36.640 --> 26:41.040
Not for, in fact, you can ask yourself another question. Take a look at what happened. Take

26:41.040 --> 26:48.960
the United States, which is the leading in the lead in the neoliberal assault against the world,

26:48.960 --> 26:56.800
against the population. Well, there's measures of what's happened. The Miranda Corporation,

26:56.800 --> 27:03.280
very respectable quasi-governmental research corporation, did a study of the

27:04.960 --> 27:13.440
general economic effects of the neoliberal period. Over 40 years, they found,

27:13.440 --> 27:21.680
they studied what they called a lightly transfer of wealth, highway robbery to be more exact,

27:22.400 --> 27:29.840
transfer of wealth from the working class and the middle class, lower 90% of the population

27:30.400 --> 27:42.560
transferred to the top 1%, $50 trillion in 40 years. That's very effective class war.

27:43.440 --> 27:51.600
Well, you have concentrated economic power on one side, largely controlling the state. You have

27:52.240 --> 27:59.120
general population on the other side when there are efforts to make some moves. Concentrated power

28:00.240 --> 28:08.560
comes down on them very hard for the unions, Corbyn efforts, Sanders efforts, Lyman.

28:09.520 --> 28:19.520
You can fight against it. Over the centuries, there's been many victories. We don't have slavery.

28:20.080 --> 28:27.440
We don't have a few laws. There are victories, but they're hard to win. You have to recall,

28:27.440 --> 28:35.920
remember that those with, go back to Adam Smith at the beginning of the early days of the

28:36.880 --> 28:45.520
capitalist industrial revolution. I was an astute observer. He pointed out that in all ages,

28:46.640 --> 28:55.520
the masters of mankind pursue their vile maxim, all for ourselves, nothing for anyone else.

28:56.480 --> 29:02.800
Well, that was in the early stages. Now it's much more organized and controlled and so on,

29:02.800 --> 29:09.600
but the vile maxim still prevails, and you can see its consequences. You can fight against it.

29:10.320 --> 29:16.400
There have been victories, lots of victories even in recent years, but it's a struggle,

29:16.400 --> 29:21.120
and you're not going to win unless you recognize what the nature of the struggle is.

29:23.200 --> 29:30.160
Another threat might be cyber war. We've mentioned a few threats in the last few minutes.

29:30.720 --> 29:35.760
One of the speakers at the festival yesterday talked about the possibility that China might

29:35.760 --> 29:42.560
try and invade Taiwan. He suggested that militarily that could probably be defended,

29:42.560 --> 29:47.760
but the consequence would be that China might unleash a cyber war on the west

29:47.760 --> 29:55.440
that we couldn't defend against. Does that technological war worry you? Is that on your list

29:55.440 --> 30:03.360
of things that are challenging humanity along with nuclear power and climate change and ordinary

30:03.360 --> 30:12.480
war and so on? Well, we have to bear in mind that the world's major propaganda system in the United

30:12.480 --> 30:21.520
States, which also has an enormous effect on Britain, largely the satellite of the United

30:21.600 --> 30:30.400
States by now, one of its main themes is you have to hate China, critical, yellow peril,

30:31.200 --> 30:36.960
so we have to be very worried about China invading Taiwan. Is there any sign of that?

30:39.440 --> 30:45.680
There's some good point to build up of military in the area, exercises that are going very close

30:45.680 --> 30:56.640
to airspace. Military exercises largely in response to US provocation. So when there is

30:57.440 --> 31:06.880
a policy called the One China Policy, it's been in place for 50 years, was settled in the 1970s.

31:06.880 --> 31:16.880
The policy is US and China agree that Taiwan is part of China and both agree to what was called

31:16.880 --> 31:26.320
strategic ambiguity. We don't say it in words, but we agree that we will do nothing to disrupt

31:27.120 --> 31:38.000
this program by threats to challenging. Who's been challenging it? China's not a saintly power,

31:38.000 --> 31:45.680
there's plenty you can preserve. But in reality, in this case, it's the US that's been provoking it,

31:45.760 --> 31:56.800
partly just militarily. The official US policy is quoting it to encircle China

31:57.520 --> 32:06.960
with a ring of sentinel states with advanced weapons, advanced precision weapons aimed at China,

32:07.920 --> 32:24.240
South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Guam, Australia, all surrounding China to encircle and constrain it.

32:25.280 --> 32:33.040
In the case of Taiwan, the US has been regularly breaking the strategic ambiguity.

32:33.760 --> 32:42.480
So when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi went to Taiwan, that was saying we're breaking the

32:42.480 --> 32:51.760
arrangements. China did respond, as you described, with naval maneuvers, to indicate that it can,

32:51.760 --> 33:00.240
if it wants, blockade Taiwan. This has continued. Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed the

33:00.240 --> 33:10.560
Taiwan Policy Act, which says that Taiwan has to be treated as a normal non-nado ally with normal

33:10.560 --> 33:22.080
diplomatic relations, weapon systems, interoperability of weapons, and so on. China reacts by carrying

33:22.160 --> 33:31.520
out symbolic actions in the region around China. Those are not the only naval actions.

33:31.520 --> 33:38.560
There are others that you didn't mention, like RIMPAC, enormous naval operations run by the

33:38.560 --> 33:45.440
United States and its allies threatening China. But we don't talk about that. Since we own and

33:45.440 --> 33:51.600
run the world, what we do is fine. We have to worry about it. We have to concentrate on people

33:51.600 --> 34:00.720
who are violating the rules we establish. Right now, the United States has openly, publicly

34:00.720 --> 34:11.120
declared an economic war with China to try to prevent it from developing the advanced technologies

34:11.120 --> 34:18.480
that we need for the modern age. It's not a secret. You read about it in the London Financial Times,

34:18.480 --> 34:28.400
which describes it correctly as a war against China. China is reacting now by things like

34:28.400 --> 34:36.000
the initiatives to bring Saudi Arabia and Iran together to overcome that conflict and to throw

34:36.000 --> 34:44.560
wrench in U.S. policy of dominating the Middle East through an alliance of reactionary states

34:45.040 --> 34:51.680
called the Abraham Accord, including Saudi Arabia as a central, not a literal, but

34:51.680 --> 35:00.960
partner, aimed at U.S. enemy Iran. China is disrupting that to blow to U.S. and Israel.

35:01.760 --> 35:09.200
So, yes, these things are happening in the world. But if we're within inside the U.S.

35:09.200 --> 35:17.440
propaganda bubble, as Britain mostly is, then, of course, we have to hate China and talk about

35:17.440 --> 35:22.400
all the terrible things that China might be doing, but not talk about what we're doing,

35:22.400 --> 35:26.640
because that's quite proper and appropriate since we own the world.

35:27.760 --> 35:34.240
You have spoken out, if we kind of move to Russia and Ukraine, you have spoken out

35:34.880 --> 35:41.440
and cautioned against how people view NATO. You have, I think, kind of reminded people

35:42.320 --> 35:50.640
that they need to look at NATO without kind of, without looking through rose-tinted glasses.

35:50.640 --> 35:55.440
So they need to kind of be careful how they view Russia, but also careful how they view NATO.

35:56.480 --> 36:00.800
And I think you've talked about the fact that kind of negotiation should be happening, that

36:00.800 --> 36:07.120
the U.S. should be promoting peace negotiations and so on. Do you see any evidence of that?

36:07.680 --> 36:13.920
And do you think a modern war could be ended through negotiation, rather than having one

36:13.920 --> 36:23.520
winner and one loser? Right now, the positions of the opposing parties

36:23.600 --> 36:32.160
are, look, irreconcilable on paper, but that's where diplomacy and negotiations enter.

36:33.040 --> 36:37.840
You see if you can make moves towards overcoming it, and there are proposals.

36:40.480 --> 36:48.240
An article in the current issue of the Monte Diplomatique by two Finnish diplomats talks about

36:48.240 --> 36:53.600
means you could use. Well, right now, the United States has an official position,

36:54.400 --> 37:00.320
and Britain, as a loyal satellite of the United States, simply repeats the position.

37:01.040 --> 37:06.960
The position is, we must continue the war in order to severely weaken Russia.

37:07.920 --> 37:15.440
That's the official U.S. position. Basically, the U.S. imposed it on NATO. NATO, incidentally,

37:15.440 --> 37:20.880
is now a Pacific power. Of course, the United States, at the latest summit meeting,

37:21.600 --> 37:27.280
determined that NATO must support the United States' confrontation with China and the Pacific.

37:27.920 --> 37:37.920
But the U.S. position is perfectly explicit. No diplomacy until, because we must severely

37:37.920 --> 37:43.680
weaken Russia. Now, if you look at it, the United States is getting a bargain.

37:44.640 --> 37:53.360
Not a big secret. It's discussed in Chatham House by U.S. commentators. For a small portion

37:54.000 --> 38:02.400
of the U.S. colossal military budget, it's severely degrading the military forces of its own

38:02.400 --> 38:08.640
only military adversary. That's a bargain. The United States is getting another bargain.

38:09.600 --> 38:15.120
Putin's invasion of Ukraine is, of course, criminal aggression.

38:15.920 --> 38:23.040
Major war crime. Also, an act of criminal stupidity from his point of view. It gave the

38:23.040 --> 38:32.960
United States its most welcome gift on a silver platter. Europe drove Europe into the pocket of

38:32.960 --> 38:40.640
the United States. It was an alternative. Combination between Europe and the East. Very

38:40.640 --> 38:49.200
natural. The continental Europe has a very effective industrial system, German-based

38:49.200 --> 38:56.560
industrial system, complex system. It's based very heavily on the relations with their natural

38:56.560 --> 39:02.800
commercial partner to the East. Russia doesn't have much of an economy. It's about at the level

39:02.800 --> 39:11.920
of Mexico. It has rich resources, raw materials, not just oil, petroleum, but minerals, and so on.

39:12.640 --> 39:21.120
It's a path to the China market, enormous China market. In fact, the major EU market.

39:22.560 --> 39:30.320
One possibility for Putin was to accept efforts at accommodation, which were, in fact, presented

39:30.320 --> 39:37.680
regularly, particularly by Emmanuel Macron, telephone conversations up to a couple of

39:37.680 --> 39:46.000
days before the invasion. Not interested in wanting to drive Europe into the US pocket.

39:46.640 --> 39:53.200
Well, for Europe, that's pretty serious. Europe, while the United States is gaining enormously

39:53.200 --> 40:00.000
from the war, not just financially in terms of military power, but even geopolitically

40:00.640 --> 40:09.440
with Europe now subordinated to it, Europe is facing a serious problem. Economist Magazine

40:09.440 --> 40:16.880
points out that Europe is facing a kind of the industrialization, not just from its break,

40:16.960 --> 40:23.680
from its commercial partners to the East, but even with regard to China. So part of the

40:24.400 --> 40:34.240
US war against China is to compel other countries, European countries, to break their relations

40:34.240 --> 40:42.720
with the China market. Pretty serious. Take a look at the Netherlands as the world's most advanced

40:43.360 --> 40:50.800
lithographic industry, which produces essential parts for computer chips,

40:50.800 --> 40:58.960
to semiconductors, and so on. The United States is ordering them, lose your main market, China.

41:00.160 --> 41:07.680
Will they agree? We don't know. Ordering Samsung in South Korea to do the same thing.

41:08.560 --> 41:14.400
You lose your main market, because we don't want China to develop. Same in Japan.

41:15.280 --> 41:24.320
Will they accept it? Open question. Let's go back to crime. Just look at logic for a moment.

41:25.280 --> 41:33.520
Either the war will be a stalemate and continue indefinitely, or it'll be settled.

41:34.400 --> 41:42.320
Can't argue about that. That's logic. Well, if it's a stalemate, Ukraine is going to suffer

41:42.320 --> 41:49.120
miserably. It's already being severely harmed to military forces,

41:49.920 --> 41:57.840
badly harmed, economy severely harmed. Go on with the stalemate, it'll get much worse.

41:57.920 --> 42:04.880
Russia will be harmed too, but too much more. Substantial society will probably survive it.

42:05.760 --> 42:11.760
That's if there's a stalemate. Alternative to a stalemate, one of two possibilities.

42:12.560 --> 42:20.000
Either one side capitulates, or there's a negotiated settlement. Well, Russia is not

42:20.000 --> 42:27.840
going to capitulate. That's pretty clear. The alternative is a negotiated settlement,

42:28.560 --> 42:37.520
diplomacy. Who's in favor of it? Who's against it? The United States and its British satellite

42:37.520 --> 42:45.920
are against it. We must continue the war to weaken Russia. In fact, that happened dramatically

42:45.920 --> 42:55.440
last March. There were negotiations underway between Ukraine and Russia under Turkish auspices.

42:56.160 --> 43:03.440
Boris Johnson, who was then the prime minister, flew to Kyiv and informed the Ukrainians that

43:04.240 --> 43:10.240
Britain and the United States don't think this is the time for negotiations. He was followed by

43:10.880 --> 43:18.240
US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, the Western media don't cover this. It's not a proper topic

43:18.240 --> 43:24.800
for them, but apparently he gave his usual message of no negotiations. Now I have to

43:24.800 --> 43:30.560
continue with the war. Well, the negotiations crashed. We don't actually know the reasons

43:30.560 --> 43:36.720
there's very little coverage, but that was probably part of it at least. But the US and Britain

43:36.720 --> 43:46.400
persist in saying we must continue the war to weaken Russia. Now there is an official

43:47.120 --> 43:54.400
version of this. It says we must continue the war so that Ukraine will be in a better negotiating

43:54.400 --> 44:01.440
position. Does that make sense? Ukraine's going to be in a worse negotiation position,

44:02.400 --> 44:10.080
suffering badly. So let's tell the truth. We have to fight the war, continue the war,

44:10.080 --> 44:17.200
to weaken Russia, strengthen ourselves at the cost of everyone else, mainly Ukrainians.

44:17.920 --> 44:25.120
Well, how does the world react to this? The world says we don't want it. Almost the entire world

44:25.200 --> 44:32.080
opposes this position. Check back at the Munich Strategic Conference a couple of weeks ago,

44:32.080 --> 44:39.200
the International Conference. The United States made every effort to try to bring

44:39.760 --> 44:49.600
the global south into support for the US campaign in Ukraine. Nobody, not India,

44:49.680 --> 44:57.840
not Indonesia, not long-time US allies like Colombia, Brazil. They all said no.

44:59.840 --> 45:05.440
What they said is this is a proxy war between you and Russia. We don't have any part of it.

45:06.080 --> 45:12.240
We're certainly not going to pay attention to the bombast that comes out of the British and

45:12.240 --> 45:19.040
American media and propaganda system about fighting a noble war for democracy.

45:19.680 --> 45:26.320
We've had enough experience with you to know what that means, hundreds of years of experience.

45:26.880 --> 45:33.200
So keep your bombast and pretentiousness for yourselves. We're looking at the actual world.

45:33.920 --> 45:38.800
We don't want to be part of this. We would like to see a diplomatic settlement that will end the

45:38.800 --> 45:47.840
horrors before they get worse. Take continental Europe. There's a difference between a lead opinion

45:48.400 --> 45:52.480
and public opinion. We have polls. These are free countries.

45:53.440 --> 46:02.560
Polls show strong support for negotiation and diplomacy. The educated classes, the media say,

46:02.560 --> 46:10.960
no, we have to go along with the US-British no negotiations policy. That's the way the world

46:11.040 --> 46:17.520
is dividing up. Well, what does this mean for Ukraine? Just think through the logic and just

46:17.520 --> 46:25.840
plain logic. Russia is not going to capitulate. Ukraine is not going to get in a better negotiating

46:25.840 --> 46:33.600
position. Either there will be some kind of stalemate, which will be devastating for Ukraine,

46:34.320 --> 46:40.960
very dangerous in other respects, arms, millions of people in the world because of

46:41.600 --> 46:50.400
the curtailing of grain and fertilizer exports. Very significant threat of escalation to major war.

46:51.600 --> 46:58.560
So far, Russia has not emulated the US-British war style of war.

46:58.640 --> 47:11.360
President Biden, Janet Yellen, other officials have visited Kyiv. Do you remember anybody who

47:11.360 --> 47:19.920
visited Baghdad when the US and Britain were pounding at the dust? Remember anybody? No.

47:19.920 --> 47:26.480
In fact, the few peace volunteers who were there were ordered out of the country because the United

47:26.480 --> 47:34.880
States and Britain were smashing it up properly. That's a difference. It might move to expand the

47:34.880 --> 47:43.600
war to the US-British style, go after the jugular, destroy communications, destroy energy,

47:45.280 --> 47:53.760
destroy transportation, destroy everything that allows the country to function, go after

47:53.760 --> 48:01.760
Western Ukraine with a vengeance, attack supply routes, presumably leave you in the confrontation

48:01.760 --> 48:09.520
with NATO. Then what happens? Now it's tanks. It's beginning with jet planes. Next will be a

48:09.520 --> 48:16.640
further escalation. The Ukrainians are the ones who'll suffer most, but the rest of the world is

48:16.640 --> 48:24.800
also facing a problem. Well, the Ukrainians make their own decisions. What they decide,

48:24.800 --> 48:32.240
we should support. They have a right to defend themselves. But we have our own countries to

48:32.240 --> 48:42.960
care about. We are responsible for US, British, Irish, German policy. People of the countries

48:42.960 --> 48:50.960
are responsible for it. I'm in the United States. Should we support a policy that says,

48:51.760 --> 48:58.320
let's continue to fight the war, no matter how devastating the effect in order to severely

48:58.320 --> 49:07.360
weaken Russia? No, I don't think so. We should stop the campaign to block negotiations and diplomacy.

49:08.000 --> 49:14.480
Can they succeed? You don't know unless they try. They'll try. Of course, they don't succeed.

49:15.600 --> 49:22.640
If there were to be a negotiated settlement or to be negotiations, could the result ever be

49:23.520 --> 49:29.120
just from a Ukrainian point of view? Is that just a moral?

49:29.120 --> 49:36.800
Diplomatic settlements. Diplomatic settlements almost by definition are not just a diplomatic

49:36.800 --> 49:43.760
settlement as one which all sides accept reluctantly because none of them get their

49:43.760 --> 49:50.880
maximum objectives, but they see that as the best of the possible outcomes or at least the least

49:50.880 --> 50:04.000
worse. That's the nature of diplomatic settlements. If you don't want that, let's escalate to total

50:04.000 --> 50:13.920
destruction. Yeah. We've about 10 minutes left. I'm going to come to a couple of questions from

50:13.920 --> 50:19.120
people who are watching in a minute, but maybe if we could look at, I suppose, the rise of the

50:19.120 --> 50:24.320
algorithm, the rise of those things. We've touched on it with social media, but we have

50:25.200 --> 50:31.600
news this week, I think, that in France for the Paris Olympics, facial recognition will be allowed

50:31.600 --> 50:37.840
on a so-called temporary basis until the end of the Olympics. What is temporary often becomes

50:37.840 --> 50:45.440
very permanent. We've also got things like chat GPT, the so-called artificial intelligence chatbot

50:45.440 --> 50:52.400
that can take your question and go off and give you a bit of an answer. What do you think about

50:52.400 --> 50:59.520
that kind of our reliance on machines to make decisions? If you like taking the human out of

50:59.520 --> 51:05.840
the loop, is that a danger or is that just part of technology? It's part of just modernizing,

51:06.320 --> 51:11.600
and every technology has its good sides and its bad sides. Do these things particularly worry you?

51:15.040 --> 51:26.640
For example, there's some of the crazier proposals are that the systems of automatic

51:26.640 --> 51:39.280
warning of missile attacks should be automated to death sentence. We've had 70 years of experience

51:40.080 --> 51:49.040
of virtual, coming very close to terminal nuclear war because the systems that

51:49.680 --> 51:59.680
of our design carefully sophisticated way to determine if there's some say enemy missile attack

52:00.320 --> 52:09.760
have failed and human intervention was necessary to prevent the end termination of human life on

52:09.760 --> 52:21.600
earth. It's going to get worse if you automate them further. What has saved us so far is human

52:21.600 --> 52:29.120
intervention. Several, I don't have to go through the details, but there were several cases that

52:29.120 --> 52:35.760
are well known where Russian officials just refused to accept the information that was coming in,

52:35.760 --> 52:41.920
just didn't hand it on to the higher authorities. That's why we're alive. Hotlines are useful things

52:41.920 --> 52:50.320
for humans to talk to each other. It wasn't even a hunt. It was just a middle level official saying

52:50.320 --> 52:57.280
this can't be real. I'm not going to send it on. It was one during the Cuban Missile Crisis when

52:57.280 --> 53:04.640
Russian submarines were under attack by US destroyers. They thought they'd lost contact with

53:05.600 --> 53:10.880
central authorities, thought a war was on. Commander decided we might as well launch our

53:11.760 --> 53:17.920
torpedoes, which happened to be nuclear tipped, would have ended everything because of the reaction.

53:18.880 --> 53:28.080
One officer, Vasily Akhapov, decided to veto it. So we're now talking.

53:28.640 --> 53:35.520
There was a case when Defense Secretary William Perry was almost on the phone,

53:36.160 --> 53:42.240
called President Carter, to tell him that the sophisticated US warning systems that

53:42.240 --> 53:48.640
detected a Russian attack, he had now a couple minutes to respond. He got a call from the

53:50.000 --> 53:55.280
central official, the monitoring official, said we made a computer error. Hold it off.

53:56.080 --> 54:02.480
You want to go into that kind of system? Okay. But let's not have a look. First of all, we're very

54:03.840 --> 54:09.920
incredible. These are all human decisions. There's no technology forcing anything, nothing.

54:10.640 --> 54:19.360
We have to remember that the propaganda and the hype about these systems vastly exceeds the reality.

54:20.240 --> 54:26.960
You can read all sorts of excited articles in the newspapers, papers about

54:27.760 --> 54:40.560
chatbot being surpassing human intelligence. Are they sentient? This is total nonsense.

54:41.200 --> 54:46.480
This is basically high-tech plagiarism. You look into the nature of the systems,

54:47.440 --> 54:53.760
they're designed in such a way that in principle, they can tell you absolutely nothing about

54:54.640 --> 55:01.600
language, learning, cognition, and so on. They're doing something else. Nice toys, if you like.

55:02.160 --> 55:08.480
But no constructive purpose that anyone can think of. But they are dangerous. There are already

55:08.480 --> 55:15.520
cases. There was an article in the Washington Post a couple days ago about one case in which a

55:16.400 --> 55:24.960
something like a chatbot system, which was combined with artificial image creation,

55:24.960 --> 55:30.240
which is not that difficult these days, which was used for a major defamation project.

55:31.280 --> 55:36.320
Well, we're going to see more and that more and more of that. These are wonderful techniques for

55:36.880 --> 55:44.400
defamation, for disinformation. When bots get involved with powerful systems behind them,

55:44.880 --> 55:52.720
like states can be a major danger. They should certainly be concerned about that.

55:53.440 --> 56:03.280
But as far as taking over, doing all kind of scary things, that's us, not them.

56:05.200 --> 56:09.520
I might be dealing with this quickly, but if a question comes in, you've mentioned

56:09.520 --> 56:16.400
Washington Post, the New York Times, your morning routine of finding news from different places.

56:16.400 --> 56:21.200
Algae Zero, you've mentioned a few times. A question in that says, what are some of the

56:21.200 --> 56:27.440
important places that people might look for information that gives them a balance? Should

56:27.440 --> 56:36.240
they be looking at Brit Parts and the Daily Mail and Fox News as well as what you might

56:36.240 --> 56:40.640
see as more reputable, more impartial places? Or should they stick to kind of a set of places?

56:40.640 --> 56:45.360
Is there a list you have in mind of places you enjoy finding out things?

56:48.080 --> 56:53.920
There's no such thing as impartial. I'm not impartial. You're not impartial. You should

56:53.920 --> 57:00.720
understand it. You should be honest. It says, here's my view of the world. Understand it.

57:01.200 --> 57:09.920
Interpret what I'm saying on the basis of my own perception of how the world works.

57:10.800 --> 57:15.920
That's what the newspapers should be doing. Not saying I'm unbiased and neutral because

57:15.920 --> 57:22.720
they're not. Nobody is. Let's be honest about what we are. I try to be. You try to be.

57:23.680 --> 57:29.760
Talk to an audience. I say, here's the way I view the world. You don't have to accept it.

57:29.760 --> 57:36.400
Just see if it makes sense or not to you. Now, if you look at the media, if I was in,

57:37.120 --> 57:42.800
I say London, if I went on to spend time in London, the first thing to do in the morning

57:42.800 --> 57:51.120
is pick up half of these major newspapers. The media environment is different from the

57:51.680 --> 57:57.120
United States. You have to read half a dozen newspapers to get some degree of coverage.

57:57.120 --> 58:05.600
But you do. There's scariest journalism. Journalists themselves, especially correspondence

58:05.600 --> 58:10.720
on the ground, do excellent work. Honest, courageous, and learn a lot from them.

58:11.920 --> 58:18.480
Read the major media. Read the business press, which is often very illuminating.

58:21.280 --> 58:30.080
There are biases on their face. No problem. But financial times are very revealing material.

58:31.680 --> 58:37.680
And then look for things that are of particular interest to you. There's no algorithms for it.

58:38.800 --> 58:43.120
Too much goes on in the world to know everything. But what you're interested in,

58:43.120 --> 58:49.200
you think are important pursuers. But don't get caught up in self-reinforcing bubbles.

58:49.920 --> 58:56.880
And assume that what the major media are presenting is an accurate picture of the world.

58:57.600 --> 59:04.960
They're presenting it from a certain perspective, which is largely subordinate to powerful,

59:06.560 --> 59:12.800
to concentrated power in the private system and in the state system, which are closely related,

59:12.800 --> 59:18.880
of course, in state-connected societies. So understand the nature of the institutions

59:18.880 --> 59:26.560
and take a careful look with a critical eye. Recognize that we're fine journalists,

59:26.560 --> 59:30.160
trustworthy, and so on. That's the way it can proceed.

59:30.960 --> 59:34.640
I'm going to paraphrase one last question here from someone.

59:37.440 --> 59:41.280
You speak a lot. You're very generous with your time to different groups and different audiences.

59:42.400 --> 59:47.040
The danger of talking a lot is that there's a lot on record of what you've said.

59:47.600 --> 59:53.920
Do you often change your mind on topics and things that you once thought you had worked out

59:53.920 --> 59:59.280
and then think, you know, I've learned more, actually, it's a bit more nuanced than that?

59:59.280 --> 01:00:03.680
Or are there things that you do kind of swing around on over time?

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:08.240
Learn things over time.

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:09.200
You're human after all.

01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:17.680
You have a critical open mind. You're constantly criticizing yourself.

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:22.160
Did I understand this correctly? Is there something I should look at?

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:31.680
I should say that I'm pretty conservative in that respect. So my major conception of how the world

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:43.440
works hasn't changed much since I was 15 years old. Actually, the first article I wrote back in

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:54.880
1939 was a warning about at a 10-year-old level. I don't suggest anybody read it.

01:00:54.880 --> 01:01:00.080
What was a warning about the spread of fascism in Europe, which looked ominous at the time and

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:03.520
inexorable, still concerned about?

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:09.680
I think we're probably out of time. We've had an hour of your time this evening or

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:14.160
this afternoon for you. Noam Chomsky, you've been very generous with the festival over the years.

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:19.840
Thank you so much for dropping in again this year to help us think about ideas and politics.

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:25.280
For those who are watching at home, if you're in and about Belfast, tomorrow is the final day of

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:29.680
the festival. A few more events that you can kind of attend. If you're watching online,

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:33.440
if you click through to the YouTube channel for the festival, you can see some of the other

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:38.080
events we had this year and certainly a back catalogue of things over previous years,

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:41.760
including Noam Chomsky talking to William Crawley probably two years ago,

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:47.280
or maybe even a few years before that as well. But to close, thank you very much, sir, for your time.

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:50.800
Noam Chomsky, thank you and good night.

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:01.060
you
