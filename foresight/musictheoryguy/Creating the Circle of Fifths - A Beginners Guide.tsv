0	9440	The circle of fifths is really easy to create. All we're going to do is draw a circle as
9440	14160	on the screen and we're going to draw a clock. So, add in 12 o'clock as on the screen at
14160	19840	the moment and we add in 3 o'clock. We're going to add in 6 o'clock at the bottom and
19840	23680	then 9 o'clock just so we've got some key points on the clock face. And then we add
23680	28600	in the other o'clock, so 1 o'clock and then 2 o'clock. 3 o'clock is already there, so
28600	34960	4 o'clock and then 5 o'clock, 6 is already there, 7 o'clock, 8 o'clock, 9 is already
34960	43520	there, 10 o'clock and finally 11 o'clock.
43520	46960	The next thing you need to do is learn the series of letters that are appearing in the
46960	54320	top left hand corner of your screen, F-C-G-D-A-E-B. Now there's various ways to remember these.
54320	63280	We'll put together phrases. Personally, I quite like Father, Christmas, Gave, Dad and
63280	69000	Electric, Blanket.
69000	72680	It's only the first letter of each of those words that we're interested in, so we're
72680	76680	just going to get rid of all the words there so we just get back down to the correct order.
76680	83800	So we're back down to F-C-G-D-A-E and B.
83800	89040	To recap, we've done two things so far. We've put together a clock face, 12 o'clock, 1 o'clock
89040	94320	and so on and we've learned Father, Christmas, Gave, Dad and Electric, Blanket. Whatever
94320	101280	you do, don't forget that order of letters.
101280	106360	As you probably know, C major has got no sharps or flats in the key signature, so we're just
106400	110920	going to take that out of our order of letters and we're going to pop that at the very top
110920	115000	of our clock.
115000	119360	The word Father comes before Christmas, so we're going to pop that just before the C
119360	123760	and then Gave, Dad and Electric, Blanket all come after the word Christmas, so we're going
123760	130080	to pop those in order one by one after the C.
130080	135880	So remember that the C goes at the very top of the clock, 12 o'clock, Father goes before
135920	141280	and then it just goes Gave, Dad and Electric, Blanket in order, so it's just like a normal
141280	144400	English sentence.
144400	147560	Now for the other part of the clock, where we've got no letters at the moment, what we're
147560	151040	going to do, I'm just going to pop the phrase back up on the screen, Father, Christmas, Gave,
151040	157360	Dad and Electric, Blanket and all we do is reverse the phrase. So B goes up first, then
157360	164040	E, then A and so on. Now some people have some phrases for this. I've heard Blanket
164040	169760	exploded and Dad got charred feet. However you remember it, all you need to know is that
169760	177080	it is the original phrase with the letters going in the opposite order.
177080	179680	Now you've probably guessed already what we're going to do, but we're going to take the letter
179680	185440	B, the first letter from our reversed phrase and we're going to pop it onto the first available
185440	191360	notch of our clock. However, there's a catch. As you can see, I've had a little flat sign
191360	196240	next to it. On this side of the clock, everything is going to have a little flat sign next to
196240	202920	it. So the order will be V-flat, E-flat, E being the next letter of our phrase and then
202920	208760	A-flat, D-flat and G-flat.
208760	213240	Now don't worry that we haven't used the C and the F, but that's because all notches
213240	218000	of our clock have now been used up and there we go. We have a completed circle of fifths,
218000	222600	all ready to be used to work out what sharps and flats are in the key signatures of any
222600	226920	of the keys that you may decide to use for your theory or compositional work. Do look
226920	230760	at my other videos which will show you exactly how to use the clock itself. Thank you for
230760	231160	listening.
