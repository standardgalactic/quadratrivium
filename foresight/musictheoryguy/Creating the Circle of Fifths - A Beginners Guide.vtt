00:00.000 --> 00:09.440
The circle of fifths is really easy to create. All we're going to do is draw a circle as

00:09.440 --> 00:14.160
on the screen and we're going to draw a clock. So, add in 12 o'clock as on the screen at

00:14.160 --> 00:19.840
the moment and we add in 3 o'clock. We're going to add in 6 o'clock at the bottom and

00:19.840 --> 00:23.680
then 9 o'clock just so we've got some key points on the clock face. And then we add

00:23.680 --> 00:28.600
in the other o'clock, so 1 o'clock and then 2 o'clock. 3 o'clock is already there, so

00:28.600 --> 00:34.960
4 o'clock and then 5 o'clock, 6 is already there, 7 o'clock, 8 o'clock, 9 is already

00:34.960 --> 00:43.520
there, 10 o'clock and finally 11 o'clock.

00:43.520 --> 00:46.960
The next thing you need to do is learn the series of letters that are appearing in the

00:46.960 --> 00:54.320
top left hand corner of your screen, F-C-G-D-A-E-B. Now there's various ways to remember these.

00:54.320 --> 01:03.280
We'll put together phrases. Personally, I quite like Father, Christmas, Gave, Dad and

01:03.280 --> 01:09.000
Electric, Blanket.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.680
It's only the first letter of each of those words that we're interested in, so we're

01:12.680 --> 01:16.680
just going to get rid of all the words there so we just get back down to the correct order.

01:16.680 --> 01:23.800
So we're back down to F-C-G-D-A-E and B.

01:23.800 --> 01:29.040
To recap, we've done two things so far. We've put together a clock face, 12 o'clock, 1 o'clock

01:29.040 --> 01:34.320
and so on and we've learned Father, Christmas, Gave, Dad and Electric, Blanket. Whatever

01:34.320 --> 01:41.280
you do, don't forget that order of letters.

01:41.280 --> 01:46.360
As you probably know, C major has got no sharps or flats in the key signature, so we're just

01:46.400 --> 01:50.920
going to take that out of our order of letters and we're going to pop that at the very top

01:50.920 --> 01:55.000
of our clock.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.360
The word Father comes before Christmas, so we're going to pop that just before the C

01:59.360 --> 02:03.760
and then Gave, Dad and Electric, Blanket all come after the word Christmas, so we're going

02:03.760 --> 02:10.080
to pop those in order one by one after the C.

02:10.080 --> 02:15.880
So remember that the C goes at the very top of the clock, 12 o'clock, Father goes before

02:15.920 --> 02:21.280
and then it just goes Gave, Dad and Electric, Blanket in order, so it's just like a normal

02:21.280 --> 02:24.400
English sentence.

02:24.400 --> 02:27.560
Now for the other part of the clock, where we've got no letters at the moment, what we're

02:27.560 --> 02:31.040
going to do, I'm just going to pop the phrase back up on the screen, Father, Christmas, Gave,

02:31.040 --> 02:37.360
Dad and Electric, Blanket and all we do is reverse the phrase. So B goes up first, then

02:37.360 --> 02:44.040
E, then A and so on. Now some people have some phrases for this. I've heard Blanket

02:44.040 --> 02:49.760
exploded and Dad got charred feet. However you remember it, all you need to know is that

02:49.760 --> 02:57.080
it is the original phrase with the letters going in the opposite order.

02:57.080 --> 02:59.680
Now you've probably guessed already what we're going to do, but we're going to take the letter

02:59.680 --> 03:05.440
B, the first letter from our reversed phrase and we're going to pop it onto the first available

03:05.440 --> 03:11.360
notch of our clock. However, there's a catch. As you can see, I've had a little flat sign

03:11.360 --> 03:16.240
next to it. On this side of the clock, everything is going to have a little flat sign next to

03:16.240 --> 03:22.920
it. So the order will be V-flat, E-flat, E being the next letter of our phrase and then

03:22.920 --> 03:28.760
A-flat, D-flat and G-flat.

03:28.760 --> 03:33.240
Now don't worry that we haven't used the C and the F, but that's because all notches

03:33.240 --> 03:38.000
of our clock have now been used up and there we go. We have a completed circle of fifths,

03:38.000 --> 03:42.600
all ready to be used to work out what sharps and flats are in the key signatures of any

03:42.600 --> 03:46.920
of the keys that you may decide to use for your theory or compositional work. Do look

03:46.920 --> 03:50.760
at my other videos which will show you exactly how to use the clock itself. Thank you for

03:50.760 --> 03:51.160
listening.
