1. **Creating the Circle of Fifths:**
   - Draw a circle and divide it into 12 equal parts, like hours on a clock face (12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 o'clock).
   - Label the top position (12 o'clock) with 'C', as C major has no sharps or flats.
   - Remember the order of letters: F-C-G-D-A-E-B, which can be memorized using a mnemonic like "Father, Christmas, Gave, Dad and Electric Blanket."

2. **Placing the Major Keys:**
   - Start with 'C' at 12 o'clock, followed by 'F' (before 'C'), then 'G', 'D', 'A', and 'E' sequentially around the circle, forming a sentence in reverse order.
   - Each major key on the clock corresponds to the key signature in music theory.

3. **Placing the Minor Keys:**
   - For the flat side of the circle (to the left of 6 o'clock), take the reversed phrase ("Blanket Exploded and Dad Got Charred Feet") and place each note on the next available notch, with a flat sign next to each note.
   - The order for minor keys is V-flat (Bb), E-flat (Eb), A-flat (Ab), D-flat (Db), G-flat (Gb), and C-flat (F).

4. **Key Signatures:**
   - Each position on the circle indicates a key signature, with sharps above the 6 o'clock position and flats below it.
   - The circle helps determine the key signatures of all 24 major and minor keys in Western music theory.

5. **Utilizing the Circle:**
   - To find the sharps or flats in a key signature, locate the key on the circle and follow the sequence clockwise or counterclockwise to identify the notes that are sharp or flat in that key.

6. **Additional Resources:**
   - The speaker suggests checking other videos for guidance on using the Circle of Fifths effectively in practical music theory or compositional work.
