0	5840	hello friends this is Moin from curious techie and in this video I'm going to
5840	10080	show you how to resolve multi array error which is going to be occurred in
10080	16240	Python programming language so in this video I'm going to take cues of OpenCB
16240	22280	library and how how the multi array error occurred in OpenCB while importing
22280	29560	OpenCB library so let's get started open up your Python IDE and I'll just
29560	38280	import numpy package importing numpy package this is successfully installed
38280	44720	so we are getting like this so while importing cb2 that means OpenCB I will
44720	51080	get this traceback error called as multi array error and something numpy
51080	57160	version x something so this this usually occurs when one of the libraries and
57920	61960	Python programming language is incompatible with some of the versions of
61960	66280	the libraries so you have to you have to install the compatible version which is
66280	73020	suitable so I'm using Python 2.7.5 version here and let me show you the
73020	78720	numpy version
78720	91360	so my numpy version is 1.9.2 and my numpy path is installed at so this is the path
91360	96640	where I installed this numpy package so I'm using latest version of numpy 1.9.2
96640	103200	and I'm using OpenCB of 3.2 so that is the latest version of OpenCB so here
103200	110560	usually the error occurs because of OpenCB 3.2 it is an incompatible with
110560	118240	Python 2.7.5 so we have to install 2.4 to be compatible with Python 2.7.5 so
118240	124480	let's remove let's remove OpenCB 3.2 from where it is been installed so go to
124480	134800	C drive and go to C drive and delete this OpenCB folder from here
138400	144400	okay so after deleting this go to Python software Python file Python 27 and go
144400	150560	to libraries and site packages so here you will find CB2 file and just delete
150560	157440	that file so it is a 3.2 version file so just download the OpenCB 2.4 version
157440	162320	I'll provide the link in the description below so you can download it from there
162320	169200	just install the OpenCB 2.4 which is compatible with Python 2.7.5 so just
169200	177240	install this package in C drive so after successfully extracting all the files
177240	184360	in C drive just go to just open that folder and go to break and just open
184360	190840	Python and select your desired PC version I'm using 32 bit here so copy this
190840	197880	cb2 file and do as usual paste it in Python 27 folder libraries site
197880	207720	packages and just paste it here now just open here open the Python software
207720	219680	let's take this I'm importing numpy here so numpy is correctly installed so
219680	225960	while importing cb2 let's see what's happened yeah that's a difference it is
225960	231200	compatible and it supports cb2 now so that's why you get an error so you have
231200	236160	to change the versions of your library so that's it friends hope this video
236160	242000	helped you if not please comment your issue in the comment comment bar and
