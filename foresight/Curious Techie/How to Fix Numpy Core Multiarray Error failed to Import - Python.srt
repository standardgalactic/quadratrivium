hello friends this is Moin from curious techie and in this video I'm going to

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,080
show you how to resolve multi array error which is going to be occurred in

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,240
Python programming language so in this video I'm going to take cues of OpenCB

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:22,280
library and how how the multi array error occurred in OpenCB while importing

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:29,560
OpenCB library so let's get started open up your Python IDE and I'll just

6
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:38,280
import numpy package importing numpy package this is successfully installed

7
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:44,720
so we are getting like this so while importing cb2 that means OpenCB I will

8
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:51,080
get this traceback error called as multi array error and something numpy

9
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:57,160
version x something so this this usually occurs when one of the libraries and

10
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,960
Python programming language is incompatible with some of the versions of

11
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,280
the libraries so you have to you have to install the compatible version which is

12
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:13,020
suitable so I'm using Python 2.7.5 version here and let me show you the

13
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,720
numpy version

14
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:31,360
so my numpy version is 1.9.2 and my numpy path is installed at so this is the path

15
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,640
where I installed this numpy package so I'm using latest version of numpy 1.9.2

16
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:43,200
and I'm using OpenCB of 3.2 so that is the latest version of OpenCB so here

17
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:50,560
usually the error occurs because of OpenCB 3.2 it is an incompatible with

18
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:58,240
Python 2.7.5 so we have to install 2.4 to be compatible with Python 2.7.5 so

19
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,480
let's remove let's remove OpenCB 3.2 from where it is been installed so go to

20
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:14,800
C drive and go to C drive and delete this OpenCB folder from here

21
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,400
okay so after deleting this go to Python software Python file Python 27 and go

22
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,560
to libraries and site packages so here you will find CB2 file and just delete

23
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:37,440
that file so it is a 3.2 version file so just download the OpenCB 2.4 version

24
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,320
I'll provide the link in the description below so you can download it from there

25
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:49,200
just install the OpenCB 2.4 which is compatible with Python 2.7.5 so just

26
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:57,240
install this package in C drive so after successfully extracting all the files

27
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:04,360
in C drive just go to just open that folder and go to break and just open

28
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:10,840
Python and select your desired PC version I'm using 32 bit here so copy this

29
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:17,880
cb2 file and do as usual paste it in Python 27 folder libraries site

30
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:27,720
packages and just paste it here now just open here open the Python software

31
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:39,680
let's take this I'm importing numpy here so numpy is correctly installed so

32
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,960
while importing cb2 let's see what's happened yeah that's a difference it is

33
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:51,200
compatible and it supports cb2 now so that's why you get an error so you have

34
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,160
to change the versions of your library so that's it friends hope this video

35
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:02,000
helped you if not please comment your issue in the comment comment bar and
