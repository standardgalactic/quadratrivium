hello friends this is Moin from curious techie and in this video I'm going to

00:05.840 --> 00:10.080
show you how to resolve multi array error which is going to be occurred in

00:10.080 --> 00:16.240
Python programming language so in this video I'm going to take cues of OpenCB

00:16.240 --> 00:22.280
library and how how the multi array error occurred in OpenCB while importing

00:22.280 --> 00:29.560
OpenCB library so let's get started open up your Python IDE and I'll just

00:29.560 --> 00:38.280
import numpy package importing numpy package this is successfully installed

00:38.280 --> 00:44.720
so we are getting like this so while importing cb2 that means OpenCB I will

00:44.720 --> 00:51.080
get this traceback error called as multi array error and something numpy

00:51.080 --> 00:57.160
version x something so this this usually occurs when one of the libraries and

00:57.920 --> 01:01.960
Python programming language is incompatible with some of the versions of

01:01.960 --> 01:06.280
the libraries so you have to you have to install the compatible version which is

01:06.280 --> 01:13.020
suitable so I'm using Python 2.7.5 version here and let me show you the

01:13.020 --> 01:18.720
numpy version

01:18.720 --> 01:31.360
so my numpy version is 1.9.2 and my numpy path is installed at so this is the path

01:31.360 --> 01:36.640
where I installed this numpy package so I'm using latest version of numpy 1.9.2

01:36.640 --> 01:43.200
and I'm using OpenCB of 3.2 so that is the latest version of OpenCB so here

01:43.200 --> 01:50.560
usually the error occurs because of OpenCB 3.2 it is an incompatible with

01:50.560 --> 01:58.240
Python 2.7.5 so we have to install 2.4 to be compatible with Python 2.7.5 so

01:58.240 --> 02:04.480
let's remove let's remove OpenCB 3.2 from where it is been installed so go to

02:04.480 --> 02:14.800
C drive and go to C drive and delete this OpenCB folder from here

02:18.400 --> 02:24.400
okay so after deleting this go to Python software Python file Python 27 and go

02:24.400 --> 02:30.560
to libraries and site packages so here you will find CB2 file and just delete

02:30.560 --> 02:37.440
that file so it is a 3.2 version file so just download the OpenCB 2.4 version

02:37.440 --> 02:42.320
I'll provide the link in the description below so you can download it from there

02:42.320 --> 02:49.200
just install the OpenCB 2.4 which is compatible with Python 2.7.5 so just

02:49.200 --> 02:57.240
install this package in C drive so after successfully extracting all the files

02:57.240 --> 03:04.360
in C drive just go to just open that folder and go to break and just open

03:04.360 --> 03:10.840
Python and select your desired PC version I'm using 32 bit here so copy this

03:10.840 --> 03:17.880
cb2 file and do as usual paste it in Python 27 folder libraries site

03:17.880 --> 03:27.720
packages and just paste it here now just open here open the Python software

03:27.720 --> 03:39.680
let's take this I'm importing numpy here so numpy is correctly installed so

03:39.680 --> 03:45.960
while importing cb2 let's see what's happened yeah that's a difference it is

03:45.960 --> 03:51.200
compatible and it supports cb2 now so that's why you get an error so you have

03:51.200 --> 03:56.160
to change the versions of your library so that's it friends hope this video

03:56.160 --> 04:02.000
helped you if not please comment your issue in the comment comment bar and

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
