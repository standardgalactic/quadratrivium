00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Edmund Husserl and the Adventure of Phenomenology in 12 Minutes

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,160
What is the Adventure of Phenomenology?

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,240
Before examining this question, it's probably good to spend a few seconds on disambiguation

4
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,880
since the term Phenomenology appears in more than one context.

5
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,320
The term first came into prominence during the Enlightenment period, when philosophers

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,200
such as Kant and Hegel began using it.

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:36,380
However, Phenomenology in its modern philosophical sense began with the work of the Czech German

8
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:43,280
philosopher Edmund Husserl, who lived from 1859 to 1938, and has continued through the

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,880
20th and 21st centuries.

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:51,160
Basically, modern philosophical Phenomenology is about trying to provide an account of how

11
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,080
things appear to our awareness, and ultimately how the world appears to us in terms of our

12
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,880
subjective experience of it.

13
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,920
In other words, Phenomenology is about reflecting upon our everyday experience in order to gain

14
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,240
some sense of its underlying order, structure, and coherence.

15
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,480
Within the broad scope of this project, there are two basic variants.

16
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:18,360
Pure Phenomenology, which is also sometimes known as Transcendental Phenomenology, is the

17
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,800
type of Phenomenology associated with Husserl.

18
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,140
Through the course of his career, Husserl further divided pure Phenomenology into what

19
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:29,440
are known as its static and genetic forms.

20
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:35,760
However, in contrast to pure Phenomenology, existential Phenomenology is a type of Phenomenological

21
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:41,400
inquiry associated with later thinkers, such as Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty,

22
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,560
and Jean-Paul Sartre.

23
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,240
Within Husserl's framework, the usual way we see reality is in terms of what he calls

24
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,320
the natural attitude, where we proceed through our lives with the common natural belief that

25
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,560
the reality we inhabit is fundamentally separable from our subjective experience of it, that

26
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,080
the world is out there relative to our experience of it.

27
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:10,960
However, in contrast to the natural attitude, it is possible to adopt a Phenomenological

28
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:16,800
attitude wherein we suspend or bracket our belief in the natural attitude by recognizing

29
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,040
that it is just that, a kind of belief.

30
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,960
Note that this is very different from disbelieving in the natural attitude.

31
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:31,080
This act of bracketing, which is sometimes known as the epok, allows us to turn our

32
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,040
attention to the ongoing activity of consciousness through which our experience of reality is

33
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,760
ultimately constituted.

34
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:44,040
Husserl calls the overall act of using the epok to reveal this experiential terrain the

35
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,040
Phenomenological Reduction.

36
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,320
The basic shift in perspective that comes from employing the Phenomenological Reduction

37
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:56,000
to assume a Phenomenological attitude toward our experience can produce some surprising

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,320
insights into the fundamental nature of things.

39
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:04,400
For instance, from the point of view of the natural attitude, a minute of time is simply

40
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,680
a minute of time, regardless of how or where we spend it.

41
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,920
However, from the point of view of the Phenomenological attitude, a minute of time depends on how

42
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,400
we actually experience it.

43
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,160
For instance, a minute of time may pass very quickly for us if we're excited, or very

44
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,560
slowly if we're bored.

45
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,640
The upshot here is that the meaning of time can vary considerably depending upon whether

46
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,560
reviewing it from the perspective of the natural attitude, or from that of the Phenomenological

47
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,440
attitude.

48
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,160
But of course, the same thing applies to all the other facets of our lives.

49
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,920
Their significance varies quite a bit, depending upon whether reviewing them from a natural

50
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,280
or a Phenomenological perspective.

51
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,480
This is part of what makes Phenomenology an adventurous activity, because Phenomenology

52
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,460
involves becoming aware of the basic structure of our lives, things like the nature of reality

53
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:04,120
and consciousness, and exploring them instead of just taking them for granted.

54
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,680
Although the specific techniques for doing this are somewhat complex, let's take a few

55
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,160
seconds to give you a general sense for them.

56
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:18,200
As Hosuril describes in one of his main works, a work called Ideas, the way to go about exploring

57
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:23,920
consciousness is to undertake a search for what he calls its Essences, or Eidos.

58
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:28,520
That is, the features of our experience that are both necessary and invariant, and that

59
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,400
consequently make our experience what it is.

60
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,240
But how does one do that?

61
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,040
Once one has turned one's reflective awareness toward experience by employing the Phenomenological

62
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:45,860
Reduction, one can then undertake a second reduction called Nidetic Reduction with respect

63
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:52,840
to some more specific question, such as, what makes a dream a dream?

64
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,560
What Hosuril is after is a special moment in the Enquirer's Reflective Awareness, a

65
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:02,480
moment that he calls an Intuition, in which the Enquirer realizes the essential nature

66
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,680
of, say, a dream.

67
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,760
The Idetic Reduction helps bring about an Intuition into something's Essence by employing a method

68
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,600
known as Imaginary Variation.

69
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:20,280
In Imaginary Variation, the Enquirer varies all the possible attributes of an experience

70
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,800
as a way of exploring what is truly necessary for it to be what it is, to explore what makes

71
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,600
a dream a dream, for instance.

72
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,400
For example, would it still be a dream if nothing weird ever happened in it?

73
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,880
Would it still be a dream if I couldn't remember having fallen asleep beforehand?

74
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:45,040
Would it still be a dream if my consciousness felt sharp, rather than slightly fuzzy, etc.?

75
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,280
Hopefully this kind of exploration helps the Enquirer have a special moment of Intuition,

76
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:56,400
a kind of aha moment, in which he or she realizes the experience's overall essential nature.

77
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,800
As Husserl once famously characterized his project, back to the things themselves, by

78
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,660
which he meant the things as we experience them, rather than as we take them typically

79
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,440
for granted.

80
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:15,680
One of the first important realizations that appear in pure phenomenology is the realization

81
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,280
that consciousness is intentional, which here is a technical term that's definitely not

82
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,400
identical to the normal English word.

83
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:30,120
In phenomenological parlance, intentionality denotes two things simultaneously.

84
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,960
The intentionality of consciousness means that consciousness is ACTIONAL in nature, that

85
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,160
it is a kind of activity or doing.

86
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,240
Second, intentionality means that consciousness is REFERENTIAL in nature, that consciousness

87
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,240
is always referring to something.

88
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,280
Let's look at an example.

89
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:53,140
The kind of consciousness we have when we're dreaming involves the actual activity of dreaming.

90
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:57,220
This is the action-oriented side of dream consciousness, which is sometimes known as

91
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,220
a noasis, technically.

92
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:05,760
At the same time, dream consciousness involves a referent, in this case, a specific dream,

93
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,060
which is sometimes known as a noema, technically.

94
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:15,140
Basically, as Husserl learned from his mentor, Franz Brentano, consciousness is not like

95
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,620
a box that contains perceptions.

96
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:23,060
Instead, consciousness is an active, ongoing, referential process.

97
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:27,140
But in terms of our subjective experience, what makes dream consciousness different from

98
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,640
other modes of consciousness?

99
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,020
What would the ESSENCE of dreaming be?

100
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:37,660
What would be its necessary and invariant features?

101
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:42,980
The answer would reside in giving an account of how noasis and noamada cohere and unfold

102
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:48,700
over time in dream consciousness, and a phenomenology of dream consciousness would aim at exploring

103
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,740
how that specifically happens.

104
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:57,260
Dreaming consciousness in this way occupied Husserl for several decades.

105
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:02,940
However, toward the end of his life, he recast his vision of phenomenology in terms of exploring

106
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,660
what he called the LIFE WORLD.

107
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:11,400
Basically, the LIFE WORLD is the total assemblage of the entire world as we know it, including

108
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,060
the intersubjective and social spheres.

109
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:20,180
This shift in emphasis also heralded the advent of existential phenomenology, whose

110
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:25,940
exponents, such as Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, and Sartre, would become household names in

111
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,380
the decades that followed.

112
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:33,460
Phenomenology's emphasis on exploring different states of consciousness and the LIFE WORLD

113
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:38,180
from an experiential perspective has also helped to gain inroads into the domain of

114
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,180
psychology.

115
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:45,000
And indeed, phenomenology has inspired and influenced an entire school of psychological

116
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,840
thought, known naturally enough as phenomenological psychology.

117
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:56,840
Basically, phenomenological psychology proceeds on the basis of the theoretical and methodological

118
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:02,380
foundation established not only by Husserl, but also by the existential phenomenological

119
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,360
thinkers who followed him.

120
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,520
Given that foundation in phenomenological philosophy, phenomenological psychology seeks

121
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:15,960
to explore people's experiences of various psychological phenomena, such as the experience

122
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:21,120
of living through major depression or recovering from drug addiction.

123
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,120
Often this takes the form of asking people to describe their personal experiences of

124
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,240
these sorts of things, and then applying a stepwise qualitative research method to analyze

125
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,760
those descriptions in order to reveal their underlying psychological meaning.

126
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,680
All in all, phenomenology's influence on psychology was also one among many forces

127
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,440
that have invited psychology to shift its center away from being a purely objectivistic

128
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:51,400
undertaking to one that is also able to embrace and understand psychological phenomena in

129
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,280
more subjective, experiential terms.

130
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,680
But why is all of this important?

131
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,160
In the final analysis, why does it matter whether we explore our consciousness or our

132
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:08,720
existence or our being in the way that phenomenological thinkers like Husserl describe?

133
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,440
In his last unfinished work, Husserl gives at least a partial answer to that question.

134
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:19,660
For Husserl, the fact that Western philosophy and science have proceeded almost entirely

135
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:24,720
on the basis of the natural attitude, without truly exploring the experiential basis that

136
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,340
underlies it, has produced a kind of crisis in both philosophy and culture and ultimately

137
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,760
in the world as we know it.

138
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:39,320
As he writes, the crisis of philosophy implies the crisis of all modern sciences as members

139
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,940
of the philosophical universe.

140
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:48,760
At first a latent, then a more and more prominent crisis of European humanity itself in respect

141
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:54,540
of the total meaningfulness of its cultural life, its total existence.

142
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:59,420
For instance, isn't this a big part of why our modern world ends up giving birth to so

143
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,800
much chaos and devastation on such a regular basis?

144
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,040
Isn't it largely because we're proceeding through modernity with no real understanding

145
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:13,140
of the most fundamental elements of our lives, such as our consciousness, our being, and

146
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,260
existence as such?

147
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,920
Modern phenomenology represents an attempt to address that crisis, by grounding both

148
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:26,620
philosophy and science, and by implication, the whole of our technological world, in a

149
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:32,540
thoughtful, methodical understanding of our experience, our consciousness, and ultimately

150
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,380
the life world that we inhabit.

151
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,500
And that's Husserl in 12 Minutes.
