0	10640	Edmund Husserl and the Adventure of Phenomenology in 12 Minutes
10640	14160	What is the Adventure of Phenomenology?
14160	19240	Before examining this question, it's probably good to spend a few seconds on disambiguation
19240	23880	since the term Phenomenology appears in more than one context.
23880	28320	The term first came into prominence during the Enlightenment period, when philosophers
28320	31200	such as Kant and Hegel began using it.
31200	36380	However, Phenomenology in its modern philosophical sense began with the work of the Czech German
36380	43280	philosopher Edmund Husserl, who lived from 1859 to 1938, and has continued through the
43280	45880	20th and 21st centuries.
45880	51160	Basically, modern philosophical Phenomenology is about trying to provide an account of how
51160	56080	things appear to our awareness, and ultimately how the world appears to us in terms of our
56080	58880	subjective experience of it.
58880	63920	In other words, Phenomenology is about reflecting upon our everyday experience in order to gain
63920	69240	some sense of its underlying order, structure, and coherence.
69240	73480	Within the broad scope of this project, there are two basic variants.
73480	78360	Pure Phenomenology, which is also sometimes known as Transcendental Phenomenology, is the
78360	81800	type of Phenomenology associated with Husserl.
81800	86140	Through the course of his career, Husserl further divided pure Phenomenology into what
86140	89440	are known as its static and genetic forms.
89440	95760	However, in contrast to pure Phenomenology, existential Phenomenology is a type of Phenomenological
95760	101400	inquiry associated with later thinkers, such as Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty,
101400	104560	and Jean-Paul Sartre.
104560	110240	Within Husserl's framework, the usual way we see reality is in terms of what he calls
110280	115320	the natural attitude, where we proceed through our lives with the common natural belief that
115320	120560	the reality we inhabit is fundamentally separable from our subjective experience of it, that
120560	125080	the world is out there relative to our experience of it.
125080	130960	However, in contrast to the natural attitude, it is possible to adopt a Phenomenological
130960	136800	attitude wherein we suspend or bracket our belief in the natural attitude by recognizing
136840	141040	that it is just that, a kind of belief.
141040	145960	Note that this is very different from disbelieving in the natural attitude.
145960	151080	This act of bracketing, which is sometimes known as the epok, allows us to turn our
151080	156040	attention to the ongoing activity of consciousness through which our experience of reality is
156040	158760	ultimately constituted.
158760	164040	Husserl calls the overall act of using the epok to reveal this experiential terrain the
164040	167040	Phenomenological Reduction.
167040	171320	The basic shift in perspective that comes from employing the Phenomenological Reduction
171320	176000	to assume a Phenomenological attitude toward our experience can produce some surprising
176000	179320	insights into the fundamental nature of things.
179320	184400	For instance, from the point of view of the natural attitude, a minute of time is simply
184400	188680	a minute of time, regardless of how or where we spend it.
188680	193920	However, from the point of view of the Phenomenological attitude, a minute of time depends on how
193920	196400	we actually experience it.
196400	201160	For instance, a minute of time may pass very quickly for us if we're excited, or very
201160	203560	slowly if we're bored.
203560	207640	The upshot here is that the meaning of time can vary considerably depending upon whether
207640	212560	reviewing it from the perspective of the natural attitude, or from that of the Phenomenological
212560	214440	attitude.
214440	219160	But of course, the same thing applies to all the other facets of our lives.
219160	223920	Their significance varies quite a bit, depending upon whether reviewing them from a natural
223920	227280	or a Phenomenological perspective.
227280	232480	This is part of what makes Phenomenology an adventurous activity, because Phenomenology
232480	237460	involves becoming aware of the basic structure of our lives, things like the nature of reality
237460	244120	and consciousness, and exploring them instead of just taking them for granted.
244120	248680	Although the specific techniques for doing this are somewhat complex, let's take a few
248680	252160	seconds to give you a general sense for them.
252160	258200	As Hosuril describes in one of his main works, a work called Ideas, the way to go about exploring
258200	263920	consciousness is to undertake a search for what he calls its Essences, or Eidos.
263920	268520	That is, the features of our experience that are both necessary and invariant, and that
268520	272400	consequently make our experience what it is.
272400	275240	But how does one do that?
275240	280040	Once one has turned one's reflective awareness toward experience by employing the Phenomenological
280040	285860	Reduction, one can then undertake a second reduction called Nidetic Reduction with respect
285860	292840	to some more specific question, such as, what makes a dream a dream?
292840	297560	What Hosuril is after is a special moment in the Enquirer's Reflective Awareness, a
297560	302480	moment that he calls an Intuition, in which the Enquirer realizes the essential nature
302480	305680	of, say, a dream.
305680	310760	The Idetic Reduction helps bring about an Intuition into something's Essence by employing a method
310760	314600	known as Imaginary Variation.
314600	320280	In Imaginary Variation, the Enquirer varies all the possible attributes of an experience
320280	325800	as a way of exploring what is truly necessary for it to be what it is, to explore what makes
325800	328600	a dream a dream, for instance.
328600	333400	For example, would it still be a dream if nothing weird ever happened in it?
333400	337880	Would it still be a dream if I couldn't remember having fallen asleep beforehand?
337880	345040	Would it still be a dream if my consciousness felt sharp, rather than slightly fuzzy, etc.?
345040	349280	Hopefully this kind of exploration helps the Enquirer have a special moment of Intuition,
349280	356400	a kind of aha moment, in which he or she realizes the experience's overall essential nature.
356400	362800	As Husserl once famously characterized his project, back to the things themselves, by
362800	367660	which he meant the things as we experience them, rather than as we take them typically
367660	370440	for granted.
370440	375680	One of the first important realizations that appear in pure phenomenology is the realization
375680	381280	that consciousness is intentional, which here is a technical term that's definitely not
381280	384400	identical to the normal English word.
384400	390120	In phenomenological parlance, intentionality denotes two things simultaneously.
390120	394960	The intentionality of consciousness means that consciousness is ACTIONAL in nature, that
394960	398160	it is a kind of activity or doing.
398160	403240	Second, intentionality means that consciousness is REFERENTIAL in nature, that consciousness
403240	405240	is always referring to something.
405240	407280	Let's look at an example.
407280	413140	The kind of consciousness we have when we're dreaming involves the actual activity of dreaming.
413140	417220	This is the action-oriented side of dream consciousness, which is sometimes known as
417220	420220	a noasis, technically.
420220	425760	At the same time, dream consciousness involves a referent, in this case, a specific dream,
425760	429060	which is sometimes known as a noema, technically.
429060	435140	Basically, as Husserl learned from his mentor, Franz Brentano, consciousness is not like
435140	437620	a box that contains perceptions.
437620	443060	Instead, consciousness is an active, ongoing, referential process.
443060	447140	But in terms of our subjective experience, what makes dream consciousness different from
447140	449640	other modes of consciousness?
449640	453020	What would the ESSENCE of dreaming be?
453020	457660	What would be its necessary and invariant features?
457660	462980	The answer would reside in giving an account of how noasis and noamada cohere and unfold
462980	468700	over time in dream consciousness, and a phenomenology of dream consciousness would aim at exploring
468700	472740	how that specifically happens.
472740	477260	Dreaming consciousness in this way occupied Husserl for several decades.
477260	482940	However, toward the end of his life, he recast his vision of phenomenology in terms of exploring
482940	485660	what he called the LIFE WORLD.
485660	491400	Basically, the LIFE WORLD is the total assemblage of the entire world as we know it, including
491400	495060	the intersubjective and social spheres.
495060	500180	This shift in emphasis also heralded the advent of existential phenomenology, whose
500180	505940	exponents, such as Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, and Sartre, would become household names in
505940	509380	the decades that followed.
509380	513460	Phenomenology's emphasis on exploring different states of consciousness and the LIFE WORLD
513460	518180	from an experiential perspective has also helped to gain inroads into the domain of
518180	519180	psychology.
519180	525000	And indeed, phenomenology has inspired and influenced an entire school of psychological
525000	530840	thought, known naturally enough as phenomenological psychology.
530840	536840	Basically, phenomenological psychology proceeds on the basis of the theoretical and methodological
536840	542380	foundation established not only by Husserl, but also by the existential phenomenological
542380	545360	thinkers who followed him.
545360	550520	Given that foundation in phenomenological philosophy, phenomenological psychology seeks
550520	555960	to explore people's experiences of various psychological phenomena, such as the experience
555960	561120	of living through major depression or recovering from drug addiction.
561120	565120	Often this takes the form of asking people to describe their personal experiences of
565120	570240	these sorts of things, and then applying a stepwise qualitative research method to analyze
570240	575760	those descriptions in order to reveal their underlying psychological meaning.
575760	580680	All in all, phenomenology's influence on psychology was also one among many forces
580680	585440	that have invited psychology to shift its center away from being a purely objectivistic
585440	591400	undertaking to one that is also able to embrace and understand psychological phenomena in
591400	595280	more subjective, experiential terms.
595280	597680	But why is all of this important?
597680	602160	In the final analysis, why does it matter whether we explore our consciousness or our
602160	608720	existence or our being in the way that phenomenological thinkers like Husserl describe?
608720	614440	In his last unfinished work, Husserl gives at least a partial answer to that question.
614440	619660	For Husserl, the fact that Western philosophy and science have proceeded almost entirely
619660	624720	on the basis of the natural attitude, without truly exploring the experiential basis that
624720	630340	underlies it, has produced a kind of crisis in both philosophy and culture and ultimately
630340	632760	in the world as we know it.
632760	639320	As he writes, the crisis of philosophy implies the crisis of all modern sciences as members
639320	641940	of the philosophical universe.
641940	648760	At first a latent, then a more and more prominent crisis of European humanity itself in respect
648760	654540	of the total meaningfulness of its cultural life, its total existence.
654540	659420	For instance, isn't this a big part of why our modern world ends up giving birth to so
659440	663800	much chaos and devastation on such a regular basis?
663800	668040	Isn't it largely because we're proceeding through modernity with no real understanding
668040	673140	of the most fundamental elements of our lives, such as our consciousness, our being, and
673140	676260	existence as such?
676260	680920	Modern phenomenology represents an attempt to address that crisis, by grounding both
680920	686620	philosophy and science, and by implication, the whole of our technological world, in a
686660	692540	thoughtful, methodical understanding of our experience, our consciousness, and ultimately
692540	695380	the life world that we inhabit.
695380	697500	And that's Husserl in 12 Minutes.
