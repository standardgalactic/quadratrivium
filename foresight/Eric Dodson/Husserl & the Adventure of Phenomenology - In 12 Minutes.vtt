00:00.000 --> 00:10.640
Edmund Husserl and the Adventure of Phenomenology in 12 Minutes

00:10.640 --> 00:14.160
What is the Adventure of Phenomenology?

00:14.160 --> 00:19.240
Before examining this question, it's probably good to spend a few seconds on disambiguation

00:19.240 --> 00:23.880
since the term Phenomenology appears in more than one context.

00:23.880 --> 00:28.320
The term first came into prominence during the Enlightenment period, when philosophers

00:28.320 --> 00:31.200
such as Kant and Hegel began using it.

00:31.200 --> 00:36.380
However, Phenomenology in its modern philosophical sense began with the work of the Czech German

00:36.380 --> 00:43.280
philosopher Edmund Husserl, who lived from 1859 to 1938, and has continued through the

00:43.280 --> 00:45.880
20th and 21st centuries.

00:45.880 --> 00:51.160
Basically, modern philosophical Phenomenology is about trying to provide an account of how

00:51.160 --> 00:56.080
things appear to our awareness, and ultimately how the world appears to us in terms of our

00:56.080 --> 00:58.880
subjective experience of it.

00:58.880 --> 01:03.920
In other words, Phenomenology is about reflecting upon our everyday experience in order to gain

01:03.920 --> 01:09.240
some sense of its underlying order, structure, and coherence.

01:09.240 --> 01:13.480
Within the broad scope of this project, there are two basic variants.

01:13.480 --> 01:18.360
Pure Phenomenology, which is also sometimes known as Transcendental Phenomenology, is the

01:18.360 --> 01:21.800
type of Phenomenology associated with Husserl.

01:21.800 --> 01:26.140
Through the course of his career, Husserl further divided pure Phenomenology into what

01:26.140 --> 01:29.440
are known as its static and genetic forms.

01:29.440 --> 01:35.760
However, in contrast to pure Phenomenology, existential Phenomenology is a type of Phenomenological

01:35.760 --> 01:41.400
inquiry associated with later thinkers, such as Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty,

01:41.400 --> 01:44.560
and Jean-Paul Sartre.

01:44.560 --> 01:50.240
Within Husserl's framework, the usual way we see reality is in terms of what he calls

01:50.280 --> 01:55.320
the natural attitude, where we proceed through our lives with the common natural belief that

01:55.320 --> 02:00.560
the reality we inhabit is fundamentally separable from our subjective experience of it, that

02:00.560 --> 02:05.080
the world is out there relative to our experience of it.

02:05.080 --> 02:10.960
However, in contrast to the natural attitude, it is possible to adopt a Phenomenological

02:10.960 --> 02:16.800
attitude wherein we suspend or bracket our belief in the natural attitude by recognizing

02:16.840 --> 02:21.040
that it is just that, a kind of belief.

02:21.040 --> 02:25.960
Note that this is very different from disbelieving in the natural attitude.

02:25.960 --> 02:31.080
This act of bracketing, which is sometimes known as the epok, allows us to turn our

02:31.080 --> 02:36.040
attention to the ongoing activity of consciousness through which our experience of reality is

02:36.040 --> 02:38.760
ultimately constituted.

02:38.760 --> 02:44.040
Husserl calls the overall act of using the epok to reveal this experiential terrain the

02:44.040 --> 02:47.040
Phenomenological Reduction.

02:47.040 --> 02:51.320
The basic shift in perspective that comes from employing the Phenomenological Reduction

02:51.320 --> 02:56.000
to assume a Phenomenological attitude toward our experience can produce some surprising

02:56.000 --> 02:59.320
insights into the fundamental nature of things.

02:59.320 --> 03:04.400
For instance, from the point of view of the natural attitude, a minute of time is simply

03:04.400 --> 03:08.680
a minute of time, regardless of how or where we spend it.

03:08.680 --> 03:13.920
However, from the point of view of the Phenomenological attitude, a minute of time depends on how

03:13.920 --> 03:16.400
we actually experience it.

03:16.400 --> 03:21.160
For instance, a minute of time may pass very quickly for us if we're excited, or very

03:21.160 --> 03:23.560
slowly if we're bored.

03:23.560 --> 03:27.640
The upshot here is that the meaning of time can vary considerably depending upon whether

03:27.640 --> 03:32.560
reviewing it from the perspective of the natural attitude, or from that of the Phenomenological

03:32.560 --> 03:34.440
attitude.

03:34.440 --> 03:39.160
But of course, the same thing applies to all the other facets of our lives.

03:39.160 --> 03:43.920
Their significance varies quite a bit, depending upon whether reviewing them from a natural

03:43.920 --> 03:47.280
or a Phenomenological perspective.

03:47.280 --> 03:52.480
This is part of what makes Phenomenology an adventurous activity, because Phenomenology

03:52.480 --> 03:57.460
involves becoming aware of the basic structure of our lives, things like the nature of reality

03:57.460 --> 04:04.120
and consciousness, and exploring them instead of just taking them for granted.

04:04.120 --> 04:08.680
Although the specific techniques for doing this are somewhat complex, let's take a few

04:08.680 --> 04:12.160
seconds to give you a general sense for them.

04:12.160 --> 04:18.200
As Hosuril describes in one of his main works, a work called Ideas, the way to go about exploring

04:18.200 --> 04:23.920
consciousness is to undertake a search for what he calls its Essences, or Eidos.

04:23.920 --> 04:28.520
That is, the features of our experience that are both necessary and invariant, and that

04:28.520 --> 04:32.400
consequently make our experience what it is.

04:32.400 --> 04:35.240
But how does one do that?

04:35.240 --> 04:40.040
Once one has turned one's reflective awareness toward experience by employing the Phenomenological

04:40.040 --> 04:45.860
Reduction, one can then undertake a second reduction called Nidetic Reduction with respect

04:45.860 --> 04:52.840
to some more specific question, such as, what makes a dream a dream?

04:52.840 --> 04:57.560
What Hosuril is after is a special moment in the Enquirer's Reflective Awareness, a

04:57.560 --> 05:02.480
moment that he calls an Intuition, in which the Enquirer realizes the essential nature

05:02.480 --> 05:05.680
of, say, a dream.

05:05.680 --> 05:10.760
The Idetic Reduction helps bring about an Intuition into something's Essence by employing a method

05:10.760 --> 05:14.600
known as Imaginary Variation.

05:14.600 --> 05:20.280
In Imaginary Variation, the Enquirer varies all the possible attributes of an experience

05:20.280 --> 05:25.800
as a way of exploring what is truly necessary for it to be what it is, to explore what makes

05:25.800 --> 05:28.600
a dream a dream, for instance.

05:28.600 --> 05:33.400
For example, would it still be a dream if nothing weird ever happened in it?

05:33.400 --> 05:37.880
Would it still be a dream if I couldn't remember having fallen asleep beforehand?

05:37.880 --> 05:45.040
Would it still be a dream if my consciousness felt sharp, rather than slightly fuzzy, etc.?

05:45.040 --> 05:49.280
Hopefully this kind of exploration helps the Enquirer have a special moment of Intuition,

05:49.280 --> 05:56.400
a kind of aha moment, in which he or she realizes the experience's overall essential nature.

05:56.400 --> 06:02.800
As Husserl once famously characterized his project, back to the things themselves, by

06:02.800 --> 06:07.660
which he meant the things as we experience them, rather than as we take them typically

06:07.660 --> 06:10.440
for granted.

06:10.440 --> 06:15.680
One of the first important realizations that appear in pure phenomenology is the realization

06:15.680 --> 06:21.280
that consciousness is intentional, which here is a technical term that's definitely not

06:21.280 --> 06:24.400
identical to the normal English word.

06:24.400 --> 06:30.120
In phenomenological parlance, intentionality denotes two things simultaneously.

06:30.120 --> 06:34.960
The intentionality of consciousness means that consciousness is ACTIONAL in nature, that

06:34.960 --> 06:38.160
it is a kind of activity or doing.

06:38.160 --> 06:43.240
Second, intentionality means that consciousness is REFERENTIAL in nature, that consciousness

06:43.240 --> 06:45.240
is always referring to something.

06:45.240 --> 06:47.280
Let's look at an example.

06:47.280 --> 06:53.140
The kind of consciousness we have when we're dreaming involves the actual activity of dreaming.

06:53.140 --> 06:57.220
This is the action-oriented side of dream consciousness, which is sometimes known as

06:57.220 --> 07:00.220
a noasis, technically.

07:00.220 --> 07:05.760
At the same time, dream consciousness involves a referent, in this case, a specific dream,

07:05.760 --> 07:09.060
which is sometimes known as a noema, technically.

07:09.060 --> 07:15.140
Basically, as Husserl learned from his mentor, Franz Brentano, consciousness is not like

07:15.140 --> 07:17.620
a box that contains perceptions.

07:17.620 --> 07:23.060
Instead, consciousness is an active, ongoing, referential process.

07:23.060 --> 07:27.140
But in terms of our subjective experience, what makes dream consciousness different from

07:27.140 --> 07:29.640
other modes of consciousness?

07:29.640 --> 07:33.020
What would the ESSENCE of dreaming be?

07:33.020 --> 07:37.660
What would be its necessary and invariant features?

07:37.660 --> 07:42.980
The answer would reside in giving an account of how noasis and noamada cohere and unfold

07:42.980 --> 07:48.700
over time in dream consciousness, and a phenomenology of dream consciousness would aim at exploring

07:48.700 --> 07:52.740
how that specifically happens.

07:52.740 --> 07:57.260
Dreaming consciousness in this way occupied Husserl for several decades.

07:57.260 --> 08:02.940
However, toward the end of his life, he recast his vision of phenomenology in terms of exploring

08:02.940 --> 08:05.660
what he called the LIFE WORLD.

08:05.660 --> 08:11.400
Basically, the LIFE WORLD is the total assemblage of the entire world as we know it, including

08:11.400 --> 08:15.060
the intersubjective and social spheres.

08:15.060 --> 08:20.180
This shift in emphasis also heralded the advent of existential phenomenology, whose

08:20.180 --> 08:25.940
exponents, such as Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, and Sartre, would become household names in

08:25.940 --> 08:29.380
the decades that followed.

08:29.380 --> 08:33.460
Phenomenology's emphasis on exploring different states of consciousness and the LIFE WORLD

08:33.460 --> 08:38.180
from an experiential perspective has also helped to gain inroads into the domain of

08:38.180 --> 08:39.180
psychology.

08:39.180 --> 08:45.000
And indeed, phenomenology has inspired and influenced an entire school of psychological

08:45.000 --> 08:50.840
thought, known naturally enough as phenomenological psychology.

08:50.840 --> 08:56.840
Basically, phenomenological psychology proceeds on the basis of the theoretical and methodological

08:56.840 --> 09:02.380
foundation established not only by Husserl, but also by the existential phenomenological

09:02.380 --> 09:05.360
thinkers who followed him.

09:05.360 --> 09:10.520
Given that foundation in phenomenological philosophy, phenomenological psychology seeks

09:10.520 --> 09:15.960
to explore people's experiences of various psychological phenomena, such as the experience

09:15.960 --> 09:21.120
of living through major depression or recovering from drug addiction.

09:21.120 --> 09:25.120
Often this takes the form of asking people to describe their personal experiences of

09:25.120 --> 09:30.240
these sorts of things, and then applying a stepwise qualitative research method to analyze

09:30.240 --> 09:35.760
those descriptions in order to reveal their underlying psychological meaning.

09:35.760 --> 09:40.680
All in all, phenomenology's influence on psychology was also one among many forces

09:40.680 --> 09:45.440
that have invited psychology to shift its center away from being a purely objectivistic

09:45.440 --> 09:51.400
undertaking to one that is also able to embrace and understand psychological phenomena in

09:51.400 --> 09:55.280
more subjective, experiential terms.

09:55.280 --> 09:57.680
But why is all of this important?

09:57.680 --> 10:02.160
In the final analysis, why does it matter whether we explore our consciousness or our

10:02.160 --> 10:08.720
existence or our being in the way that phenomenological thinkers like Husserl describe?

10:08.720 --> 10:14.440
In his last unfinished work, Husserl gives at least a partial answer to that question.

10:14.440 --> 10:19.660
For Husserl, the fact that Western philosophy and science have proceeded almost entirely

10:19.660 --> 10:24.720
on the basis of the natural attitude, without truly exploring the experiential basis that

10:24.720 --> 10:30.340
underlies it, has produced a kind of crisis in both philosophy and culture and ultimately

10:30.340 --> 10:32.760
in the world as we know it.

10:32.760 --> 10:39.320
As he writes, the crisis of philosophy implies the crisis of all modern sciences as members

10:39.320 --> 10:41.940
of the philosophical universe.

10:41.940 --> 10:48.760
At first a latent, then a more and more prominent crisis of European humanity itself in respect

10:48.760 --> 10:54.540
of the total meaningfulness of its cultural life, its total existence.

10:54.540 --> 10:59.420
For instance, isn't this a big part of why our modern world ends up giving birth to so

10:59.440 --> 11:03.800
much chaos and devastation on such a regular basis?

11:03.800 --> 11:08.040
Isn't it largely because we're proceeding through modernity with no real understanding

11:08.040 --> 11:13.140
of the most fundamental elements of our lives, such as our consciousness, our being, and

11:13.140 --> 11:16.260
existence as such?

11:16.260 --> 11:20.920
Modern phenomenology represents an attempt to address that crisis, by grounding both

11:20.920 --> 11:26.620
philosophy and science, and by implication, the whole of our technological world, in a

11:26.660 --> 11:32.540
thoughtful, methodical understanding of our experience, our consciousness, and ultimately

11:32.540 --> 11:35.380
the life world that we inhabit.

11:35.380 --> 11:37.500
And that's Husserl in 12 Minutes.
