00:00.000 --> 00:04.080
Judith Butler might be the most misunderstood philosopher in the world,

00:04.080 --> 00:07.280
so I decided to read as much of their work as I could in one month.

00:07.280 --> 00:11.360
Actually, I read it in like four months, but YouTube videos need narrative now.

00:11.360 --> 00:16.160
Butler has been writing for over 40 years about a lot of things, including gender.

00:16.160 --> 00:19.920
If you've ever heard the idea that gender is performative, that's them.

00:19.920 --> 00:22.800
Their work has also been the subject of huge backlash,

00:22.800 --> 00:27.600
like in 2017, protesters in Brazil burned an effigy of Judith Butler.

00:27.680 --> 00:29.840
Philosophy doesn't usually get that spicy.

00:29.840 --> 00:32.560
I must have missed the effigy making class during my degree.

00:32.560 --> 00:35.520
Interestingly, the people with the strongest reactions to Butler

00:35.520 --> 00:38.560
often haven't understood or even read their work,

00:38.560 --> 00:41.600
and now they have a new book about the backlash.

00:41.600 --> 00:43.840
Who's Afraid of Gender?

00:43.840 --> 00:47.360
I've deliberately filmed the bulk of this video on a white void background

00:47.360 --> 00:48.960
with minimal costumes.

00:48.960 --> 00:51.760
Kind of an old-fashioned style on YouTube these days,

00:51.760 --> 00:55.760
but I wanted to get across the idea that as controversial as this stuff might be,

00:55.760 --> 00:56.880
there's nothing hidden.

00:56.880 --> 00:59.360
You're not committing yourself to anything by hearing it.

00:59.360 --> 01:03.120
It's just an invitation to listen and consider a different point of view.

01:03.120 --> 01:06.240
And really, that's a skill we could all do with practicing,

01:06.240 --> 01:10.000
because this philosophy has huge real-world implications.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.240
I was inspired to take this research journey

01:12.240 --> 01:14.800
when I read this article in The Washington Post.

01:14.800 --> 01:17.840
Students from E.C. Glass High School in Lynchburg, Virginia,

01:17.840 --> 01:20.240
applied for a grant from It Gets Better,

01:20.240 --> 01:22.960
a non-profit dedicated to kids' mental health.

01:22.960 --> 01:24.080
And they got it.

01:24.080 --> 01:27.920
They were awarded $10,000 to put a chill-out room in their school,

01:27.920 --> 01:31.520
a space with comfy chairs and relaxed lighting to go if they're stressed.

01:31.520 --> 01:31.920
Nice.

01:31.920 --> 01:34.880
But the school board sent the money back.

01:34.880 --> 01:36.560
They said that if they took it,

01:36.560 --> 01:41.920
students would have to watch pro-LGBTQ videos, which wasn't true.

01:41.920 --> 01:44.480
It Gets Better does focus on helping LGBTQ kids,

01:44.480 --> 01:46.080
but the room would have been open to anyone,

01:46.080 --> 01:48.720
and the grant had no requirements about watching anything.

01:48.720 --> 01:51.200
But the board wouldn't listen.

01:51.200 --> 01:53.920
The board discussed this for longer than they discussed

01:53.920 --> 01:57.920
the literal closure of two entire schools in their district.

01:57.920 --> 01:59.600
And that stunned me.

01:59.600 --> 02:02.480
A school board rejected $10,000 of free money

02:02.480 --> 02:04.960
and talked about something that isn't true for so long.

02:04.960 --> 02:07.040
It impaired their ability to work.

02:07.040 --> 02:08.800
So what happened here?

02:08.800 --> 02:10.320
Why couldn't they listen?

02:10.320 --> 02:14.720
This polarization is exactly what Butler's interested in.

02:14.720 --> 02:17.440
I'll take you through their technical philosophy.

02:17.440 --> 02:19.840
Although really, I wish I could just show you,

02:19.840 --> 02:23.840
because I'm somebody whose mind has definitely changed on these issues.

02:23.920 --> 02:26.080
But it's not like I can just go back in time

02:26.080 --> 02:28.080
and talk to my past self.

02:40.720 --> 02:41.360
Oh my god.

02:42.800 --> 02:44.080
These Maddlings are amazing.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.600
So, you're surprised?

02:49.600 --> 02:49.840
Yeah.

02:50.800 --> 02:51.120
Fair.

02:52.080 --> 02:54.000
But how surprised are you, really?

03:01.200 --> 03:02.240
You look like Mum.

03:02.240 --> 03:02.800
Right?

03:02.800 --> 03:04.080
You sound different.

03:04.960 --> 03:06.400
Seattle Voice Lab.

03:06.400 --> 03:06.880
Look them up.

03:08.240 --> 03:09.920
I can turn it on and off whenever I want.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.520
So in about three years, we have to move flats.

03:15.520 --> 03:17.760
And the internet contract is in your name.

03:17.760 --> 03:19.360
So when I call to cancel it,

03:19.440 --> 03:20.480
they won't talk to me.

03:20.480 --> 03:22.400
And I have to say, hang on a minute.

03:22.400 --> 03:25.680
I'll go get him and do your voice.

03:25.680 --> 03:26.640
Turn the phone.

03:28.480 --> 03:29.280
I'll be Mum and Dad.

03:29.280 --> 03:29.680
Take it.

03:30.320 --> 03:31.360
Really well, actually.

03:32.400 --> 03:33.840
There's this nice moment in about three years

03:33.840 --> 03:35.200
when you and Dad are going to be out.

03:35.200 --> 03:36.320
Actually, I think you're gone by this point.

03:36.320 --> 03:37.040
It's just me and him.

03:37.600 --> 03:39.360
And we bump into small family friends

03:39.360 --> 03:40.560
and they're super awkward about it.

03:40.560 --> 03:42.800
And Dad's just like, whatever, their problem.

03:42.800 --> 03:44.160
He's not embarrassed.

03:47.120 --> 03:48.000
Why would he be embarrassed?

03:48.960 --> 03:50.160
Were you dressed like this?

03:52.640 --> 03:53.680
Address however I want.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.560
Dude, that's the whole point.

03:57.440 --> 04:00.400
The whole thing is so liberating.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.160
Seriously, you are going to love it.

04:02.160 --> 04:03.840
Just the freedom to be.

04:03.840 --> 04:05.600
I don't want to be like you.

04:08.880 --> 04:09.280
Why not?

04:10.880 --> 04:12.320
Let's talk about Fem boys.

04:13.520 --> 04:15.920
I began at the beginning.

04:15.920 --> 04:17.920
Butler's 1988 paper,

04:17.920 --> 04:20.640
Performative Acts and Gender Constitution,

04:20.640 --> 04:23.040
one of the first things they ever wrote.

04:23.040 --> 04:24.880
And right up top, we should acknowledge,

04:24.880 --> 04:28.160
Butler's academic writing can sometimes be pretty difficult.

04:28.160 --> 04:29.120
And that's fair enough.

04:29.680 --> 04:31.520
Gender is a difficult subject.

04:32.320 --> 04:33.840
Mine took me two attempts.

04:33.840 --> 04:37.120
What made it click for me is it reminded me of a friend

04:37.840 --> 04:40.160
who will call F.

04:41.680 --> 04:45.600
F is very cool, clever and funny.

04:45.600 --> 04:47.680
And unpretentious, the kind of person who turns up

04:47.680 --> 04:49.440
to a fancy restaurant wearing a trucker hat.

04:50.240 --> 04:51.920
F is also a Fem boy.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.320
Fem boys take on attributes

04:54.320 --> 04:56.000
that are typically considered feminine,

04:56.000 --> 04:59.040
but they are not themselves women, usually.

04:59.600 --> 05:02.800
Fem boy is also a genre of online content.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.480
F dresses up like a girl

05:04.480 --> 05:06.480
and streams themselves playing video games.

05:06.480 --> 05:11.680
When I first met F, I wondered, is Fem boy a gender?

05:12.560 --> 05:15.840
Well, it's less a thing that you are

05:15.840 --> 05:19.040
and more a thing that you do like a job.

05:19.680 --> 05:22.320
And interestingly, because the Fem boy aesthetic

05:22.320 --> 05:24.800
is so shaped by online content,

05:24.800 --> 05:28.240
to do Fem boy in a way that other people will recognize

05:28.240 --> 05:30.720
requires you to adopt certain behaviors

05:30.720 --> 05:32.400
and stylized practices

05:32.400 --> 05:35.040
whose meaning is not determined by you.

05:35.680 --> 05:38.240
You can't choose what the trends are,

05:38.240 --> 05:41.520
what styles of makeup or dress signal Fem boy.

05:41.840 --> 05:44.080
You've got to learn them and do them

05:44.080 --> 05:45.920
if you want to be seen that way.

05:45.920 --> 05:48.000
And F works pretty hard at that.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.360
If you're very clever,

05:49.360 --> 05:51.920
you'll already have guessed where this is going.

05:52.800 --> 05:57.200
According to Butler, all gender works that way.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.800
In this paper, they say that gender is a thing

06:00.800 --> 06:05.120
we do through repeated, stylized acts.

06:05.120 --> 06:08.480
Not a property, but an embodied event.

06:09.280 --> 06:12.400
Those acts get their meaning from a social world.

06:12.400 --> 06:16.960
So in a way, gender is also a thing that is done to us.

06:16.960 --> 06:19.360
Gender is in no way a stable identity

06:19.360 --> 06:21.920
or locus of agency from which various acts proceed.

06:22.560 --> 06:26.720
Rather, it's an identity tenuously constituted in time,

06:26.720 --> 06:30.640
an identity instituted through a stylized repetition of acts.

06:31.280 --> 06:34.400
Further, gender is instituted through a stylization of the body

06:34.400 --> 06:36.880
and hence must be understood as the mundane way

06:36.880 --> 06:39.280
in which bodily gestures, movements and enactments

06:39.280 --> 06:42.960
of various kinds constitute the illusion of an abiding gendered self.

06:43.520 --> 06:44.720
You're ridiculous.

06:44.720 --> 06:46.240
Says discount Tom Hiddleston.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.240
Your face doesn't look like me anymore.

06:48.240 --> 06:50.720
Did you get plastic surgery on my face?

06:50.720 --> 06:52.320
Well, there's no plastic in me, babes.

06:52.320 --> 06:53.200
I'm all natural.

06:53.200 --> 06:55.120
Artificial surgery makes you natural, does it?

06:56.240 --> 07:00.480
At first glance, Butler's ideas seemed a little strange to me

07:00.480 --> 07:03.920
because we often talk as if gender is an inner truth.

07:03.920 --> 07:07.440
For example, when people change gender and come out,

07:07.440 --> 07:12.480
we're often said to be living authentically or being true to ourselves.

07:12.480 --> 07:17.680
Even the term coming out implies that there was an authentic self before who was hidden.

07:17.680 --> 07:21.520
But according to Butler, there might be no such thing.

07:22.320 --> 07:28.000
It's not that I exist and then I choose to perform gender in ways that you will recognize.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.480
I can't even form a concept of I without using gendered language

07:32.480 --> 07:36.800
and stylized practices whose meaning exists prior to me.

07:37.600 --> 07:42.240
Gender is one of the ways that human subjects come into existence.

07:42.240 --> 07:48.960
The technical term here is subjectification, and that process happens publicly.

07:49.840 --> 07:54.480
Gender creates the illusion of a private self which exists before all of that,

07:54.480 --> 07:56.960
but this is just an illusion.

07:56.960 --> 07:59.840
If a tree falls in the forest and nobody's around to hear it,

08:00.640 --> 08:02.560
it has no pronouns.

08:02.560 --> 08:08.160
Herein lies the distinction between performative and performance,

08:08.160 --> 08:09.360
which are often mixed up.

08:10.160 --> 08:13.120
When people say gender is a performance,

08:13.120 --> 08:16.160
they mean that people exist first without gender,

08:16.160 --> 08:20.240
and then they put on costumes or makeup or wigs the way that an actor does.

08:20.240 --> 08:22.800
But that's not what Butler is saying.

08:23.680 --> 08:27.040
Performative is a technical philosophy term

08:27.040 --> 08:31.440
for when you say something and by saying it, you also do it.

08:31.440 --> 08:37.120
For example, if you say I promise, you say the words and you make a promise.

08:37.120 --> 08:41.840
If a judge says I sentence you, they say it and they do it.

08:42.480 --> 08:47.040
When Butler says that gender is performative, they mean it that way.

08:47.040 --> 08:54.960
You do it and you make it so, and indeed by doing it, you are made so.

08:54.960 --> 08:57.600
And people have made fun of Butler for this idea.

08:57.600 --> 09:00.400
I've seen people say, oh, Judith Butler says,

09:00.400 --> 09:03.120
you can just choose to be any gender you want.

09:03.120 --> 09:07.360
Oh, I men can choose to be women and women can choose to be baboons

09:07.360 --> 09:09.680
and I can choose to be an attack helicopter.

09:09.680 --> 09:11.280
Ha ha, how silly.

09:11.280 --> 09:13.360
But when I actually read their work,

09:13.360 --> 09:16.000
I realized that's not what they're saying at all.

09:16.800 --> 09:22.640
Our very concept of ourselves as gendered subjects requires a social world.

09:22.720 --> 09:27.680
We depend on others for the recognition we need to become gendered subjects.

09:27.680 --> 09:31.600
We can still make some choices where whatever clothes or makeup you like,

09:32.160 --> 09:37.280
but the meaning of those things is not within our soul control.

09:37.280 --> 09:41.520
People have been making jokes like that about Butler for decades,

09:41.520 --> 09:48.560
even though they address this misunderstanding in their first paper, in the first paragraph.

09:49.520 --> 09:55.040
Almost like the people mocking them aren't really listening.

09:59.760 --> 10:04.560
There is no volitional subject behind the mime who decides, as it were,

10:04.560 --> 10:06.000
which gender it will be today.

10:06.640 --> 10:11.280
On the contrary, the very possibility of becoming a viable subject

10:11.280 --> 10:15.040
requires that a certain gender mime be already underway.

10:15.040 --> 10:17.360
I didn't come back here to argue with you, I'm trying to help.

10:17.360 --> 10:18.720
I don't believe it, it's a trick.

10:19.600 --> 10:20.960
You were born in your castle.

10:20.960 --> 10:22.560
Your favourite fruit is Chinese.

10:22.560 --> 10:24.400
Your first crush was named Flossy.

10:24.400 --> 10:27.360
No, no, no, you could have tortured me and got in that information.

10:27.360 --> 10:27.680
What?

10:27.680 --> 10:30.080
Well, I don't know, you could have gotten it out on me somehow in the future.

10:30.080 --> 10:33.680
Just listen to me, we're the same height, we have the same eyes.

10:33.680 --> 10:35.440
Your body's completely different.

10:35.440 --> 10:37.200
Yes, that's the point.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.200
Human bodies can't change that much.

10:39.200 --> 10:39.680
We can!

10:39.680 --> 10:42.400
Even if you are, even if you are, even if you are, even if you are.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.320
Let's talk about Kristen Stewart.

10:44.320 --> 10:49.040
Next on my reading list was Butler's famous 1990 book Gender Trouble.

10:49.040 --> 10:52.640
But it's pretty tough and technical, so we could use a bit of a run-up.

10:52.640 --> 10:55.040
We can actually start with this.

10:55.920 --> 11:00.560
In March 2024, actor Kristen Stewart appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone, looking…

11:04.720 --> 11:07.120
In the interview, Stewart said,

11:07.120 --> 11:11.920
I want to do the gayest f***ing thing you've ever seen in your life.

11:12.800 --> 11:20.480
If I could grow a little mustache, if I could grow a f***ing happy trail and unbutton my pants,

11:21.840 --> 11:22.800
I would.

11:22.800 --> 11:25.600
Later at the Berlin Film Festival, she added,

11:25.600 --> 11:31.200
The existence of a female body thrusting any type of sexuality at you that's not designed for

11:31.200 --> 11:37.440
or desired by exclusively cis straight males is something people are not super comfy with.

11:37.440 --> 11:39.600
And so I am really happy with it.

11:39.600 --> 11:41.280
I had a great time.

11:41.280 --> 11:45.520
A lot of people think that there's a difference between sex and gender.

11:46.240 --> 11:51.680
Sex is supposed to be the physical thing, some combination of genes or genitals or gametes,

11:51.680 --> 11:55.760
or maybe it's something in your brain, but it's there in the world.

11:55.760 --> 12:01.280
And gender is just what we do with it, or at least that's how the story goes.

12:01.280 --> 12:05.200
It might be helpful to know something of the history of that idea.

12:05.840 --> 12:09.360
For millennia, male-dominated societies exploited women

12:09.360 --> 12:12.960
and justified it by claiming that we are naturally inferior.

12:12.960 --> 12:16.480
From Greek and Roman philosophers saying that women can't be educated,

12:16.480 --> 12:20.480
to Victorian doctors saying that we are too emotional to vote, to today.

12:20.480 --> 12:26.880
Some people still say women are by nature not equipped to live as equal members of society.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.720
Oh, she could never lead a nation.

12:28.720 --> 12:30.800
What if she got her period and started a war?

12:32.000 --> 12:35.600
Misogyny has consistently justified itself by appealing to

12:35.680 --> 12:39.520
facts about our bodies that are simply made up.

12:39.520 --> 12:42.800
If you'd like to know more about the history of this practice, then I really recommend

12:44.240 --> 12:48.320
The Once and Future Sex by historian Eleanor Yanagher.

12:48.320 --> 12:52.160
Into this context comes French philosopher Simone de Beauvoir,

12:52.160 --> 12:58.320
whose landmark book The Second Sex comes out in 1949 and opens with this sentence.

12:58.320 --> 13:01.920
One is not born, but rather becomes a woman.

13:01.920 --> 13:07.440
De Beauvoir challenges this history, saying that whilst there are facts about female biology,

13:08.000 --> 13:14.080
male-dominated society also makes a lot of stuff up and claims that the stuff it makes up is facts.

13:14.080 --> 13:19.680
The technical term here is naturalization, making something appear natural.

13:19.680 --> 13:22.080
For example, women are denied the vote?

13:22.080 --> 13:24.560
Well, it's not because we live in an unequal society,

13:24.560 --> 13:29.040
it's because the female brain just can't handle it because of biology.

13:29.040 --> 13:38.240
So, she says, one is born female, but woman is a socially constructed ideal of subordination,

13:38.240 --> 13:42.640
that we are encouraged to embrace and punished for defying.

13:42.640 --> 13:48.960
And then, in the 1980s, along come French philosophers Monique Wittig and Michel Foucault,

13:48.960 --> 13:54.640
who say this sex versus gender distinction is just another layer of control.

13:55.280 --> 14:02.880
De Beauvoir thinks that woman is an oppressive social construct, but female somehow isn't?

14:04.320 --> 14:09.760
Human beings are 99.9% identical. Who does it serve to split hairs about the remaining 0.1%?

14:10.560 --> 14:15.200
Defining one half of the human species in terms of our capacity to carry babies and be fertile

14:15.200 --> 14:21.280
and straight and thereby participate in systems of property and inheritance overwhelmingly controlled

14:21.280 --> 14:28.080
by men? Does that sound like a natural distinction? Or does it sound like a political one?

14:28.080 --> 14:34.080
Wittig actually says that women should reject womanhood entirely by becoming lesbians,

14:34.080 --> 14:38.560
rejecting the patriarchal categories of both woman and female.

14:38.560 --> 14:44.720
Categories which she says only make sense inside the heterosexual matrix.

14:44.800 --> 14:51.840
Do not try and change sex. That's impossible. Instead, only try to realize the truth.

14:54.080 --> 14:59.440
There is no sex. We've been compelled in our bodies and in our minds to correspond

14:59.440 --> 15:03.520
feature by feature with the idea of nature that has been established for us,

15:03.520 --> 15:08.160
distorted to such an extent that our deformed body is what they call natural,

15:08.160 --> 15:13.040
what is supposed to exist as such before oppression, distorted to such an extent

15:13.040 --> 15:17.520
that in the end oppression seems to be a consequence of this nature within ourselves.

15:18.080 --> 15:23.440
By admitting that there is a natural division between women and men, we naturalize history.

15:23.440 --> 15:28.080
Not only do we naturalize history, but also consequently we naturalize the social phenomena

15:28.080 --> 15:34.160
which express our oppression, making change impossible. Lesbian is the only concept I know

15:34.160 --> 15:40.640
of which is beyond the categories of sex, woman and man, because the designated subject, lesbian,

15:40.640 --> 15:44.800
is not a woman, either economically or politically or ideologically.

15:45.520 --> 15:50.080
For what makes a woman is a specific social relation to a man, a relation that we have

15:50.080 --> 15:55.280
previously called servitude, a relation which implies personal and physical obligation as well

15:55.280 --> 16:00.080
as economic obligation, forced residence, domestic corvée, conjugal duties, unlimited production

16:00.080 --> 16:06.480
of children, etc. A relation which lesbians escape by refusing to become or stay heterosexual.

16:07.120 --> 16:11.120
I'm not sure that I personally agree with everything Wittig says, but it's a provocative

16:11.120 --> 16:17.760
thought, worth listening to, and in gender trouble, Butler thinks so too. They say we should

16:17.760 --> 16:24.640
question the idea that sex is a natural category. That might sound very out there, but just listen

16:24.640 --> 16:30.240
for a moment. Once upon a time, people believed that race was a natural category. They wrote

16:30.240 --> 16:35.120
scientific papers about it and measured people's skulls and took blood samples and they believed

16:35.120 --> 16:40.720
that it was real. Nowadays we know that race is a political grouping that was naturalized,

16:40.720 --> 16:46.720
made to look natural, in large part to justify slavery. And we also know that sex was a big

16:46.720 --> 16:53.520
part of that. Black women and white women were categorized very differently. So are you certain

16:54.080 --> 16:59.440
that the distinction between male and female is as secure as you've been told?

17:01.520 --> 17:02.400
Who told you that?

17:02.640 --> 17:06.960
Why did they tell you it?

17:09.040 --> 17:12.080
And who benefits from you continuing to believe it?

17:12.080 --> 17:13.920
You think that's pussy you're eating now?

17:13.920 --> 17:19.440
This is the artistic space that Christian Stewart's photo shoot is playing in. The

17:19.440 --> 17:26.560
piece and Stewart's comments engage in what Butler calls re-signification, giving a new

17:26.560 --> 17:32.800
meaning to something. In this case, Stewart's body. The question it poses is, what if this

17:33.520 --> 17:42.720
is also female? What does that tell us about the sense or non-sense of gendered categories?

17:42.720 --> 17:51.200
But if sex isn't real, then why did I go through all the trouble of changing mine?

17:51.600 --> 17:55.440
It's a blunt question, but it's not an unfair one.

17:56.320 --> 18:03.360
So when I finished gender trouble, I also read this, Whipping Girl by Julius Serrano. Serrano

18:03.360 --> 18:09.600
is a biologist. She believes in what she calls subconscious sex, something in the brain that

18:09.600 --> 18:14.960
expects the body to be a certain way. She thinks this would explain the existence of people like

18:14.960 --> 18:22.960
me and also her, whose gender just feels right. It's an interesting idea, and I think it gets

18:22.960 --> 18:30.480
to the heart of an intuition a lot of us have to go, look, like physical differences are there.

18:30.480 --> 18:34.480
We can see them. Some human beings can get pregnant and others can't. Like,

18:35.200 --> 18:40.080
is Butler really saying that all of that isn't real? But then I read the book again,

18:40.080 --> 18:46.400
and it turns out that's also a misunderstanding. Butler's not saying that the physical world

18:46.400 --> 18:50.720
isn't there or even that it's unknowable. They're just saying that whatever facts

18:50.720 --> 18:58.480
there might be about biological sex, we can only learn them and talk about them through gender.

18:59.200 --> 19:05.440
To say the sentence, my brain expects my body to be female, is to draw on a particular understanding

19:05.440 --> 19:09.040
of the word female. And while we're at it, a particular understanding of the meaning of the

19:09.040 --> 19:16.400
words my and body, that get their meaning from a social world. I've seen some more recent philosophers

19:16.400 --> 19:23.040
use the term sex slash gender, and even sex slash gender slash race. And now I understand why we

19:23.040 --> 19:28.080
can't really think about those things separately. It's not that there's sex, the biological reality,

19:28.080 --> 19:33.440
and then there's gender on top of it. It's all gender. It's all gender.

19:33.920 --> 19:39.440
Or why it has been. Physical features appear to be in some sense there on the far side of language,

19:39.440 --> 19:44.480
unmarked by a social system. It is unclear, however, that these features could be named

19:44.480 --> 19:49.680
in a way that would not reproduce the reductive operation of the categories of sex. In other words,

19:49.680 --> 19:56.240
sex imposes an artificial unity on an otherwise discontinuous set of attributes. As both discursive

19:56.240 --> 20:03.040
and perceptual, sex denotes a historically contingent epistemic regime, a language that forms

20:03.040 --> 20:07.920
perception by forcibly shaping the interrelationships through which physical bodies are perceived.

20:08.640 --> 20:13.520
The existence and facticity of the material or natural dimensions of the body are not denied,

20:13.520 --> 20:18.000
but reconceived as distinct from the process by which the body comes to bear cultural meanings.

20:18.560 --> 20:23.600
If gender is the cultural significance that the sexed body assumes, and if that significance

20:23.600 --> 20:27.760
is co-determined through various acts in their cultural perception, then it would appear that

20:27.760 --> 20:33.520
from within the terms of culture, it is not possible for no sex as distinct from gender.

20:57.760 --> 21:02.800
A woman is a human being who belongs to the sex class that produces large gametes.

21:05.280 --> 21:09.840
May I suggest also posting interesting and positive content on other matters?

21:09.840 --> 21:13.920
I live in England, where a lot of people are talking about sex at the moment.

21:14.800 --> 21:22.640
Some say that sex is a fixed point that cannot be changed or signified or questioned,

21:22.640 --> 21:27.440
whereas gender is just a nebulous feeling or a contested belief.

21:28.560 --> 21:30.960
I thought all that feminist philosophy was pretty interesting,

21:31.920 --> 21:37.920
but it seems some people don't want to listen.

21:53.040 --> 21:57.600
What if they walk in now and say you made a mistake?

21:57.600 --> 21:59.200
Then I made the mistake you wanted to make.

21:59.200 --> 22:01.040
Better the devil you know than the devil you don't.

22:01.760 --> 22:03.600
The gates of hell are locked from the inside.

22:03.600 --> 22:05.360
What makes me suspicious, right?

22:05.360 --> 22:08.560
Is you're coming in here going, oh, everything's wonderful, right?

22:08.560 --> 22:11.520
Trying to convince me, but you don't mention any downsides.

22:11.520 --> 22:12.800
Of course there's downsides.

22:12.800 --> 22:13.360
Well go on then.

22:15.840 --> 22:16.800
Street harassment?

22:19.280 --> 22:20.880
Men are going to shout at you in the street.

22:21.840 --> 22:24.480
Men push into you and interrupt you.

22:24.480 --> 22:25.280
And?

22:26.080 --> 22:29.760
And it's scary sometimes being a woman.

22:33.840 --> 22:35.440
There's this girl called Sarah Everard.

22:36.720 --> 22:40.560
She's going to get murdered in 2021 by a police officer.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.000
It's a big thing.

22:42.000 --> 22:42.880
It's on all the news.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.520
And I have a vigil for her in London.

22:45.520 --> 22:46.960
Women come from all over the country.

22:47.760 --> 22:51.280
And the police beat and arrest the women at the vigil.

22:53.040 --> 22:55.760
And you're going to see that and you're going to feel scared because it's like,

22:57.120 --> 22:59.760
wow, this is how they treat us.

23:01.360 --> 23:02.160
Were you there?

23:05.440 --> 23:05.940
No.

23:08.320 --> 23:10.960
I didn't feel entitled to.

23:12.320 --> 23:12.820
Good.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.840
The body we have is threatening.

23:16.160 --> 23:20.240
It wouldn't be appropriate for us to be out and about violence against women.

23:20.240 --> 23:21.200
We're not violent.

23:22.560 --> 23:27.040
I mean, we're like tall, but so are giraffes.

23:28.720 --> 23:29.680
Bodies are just bodies.

23:32.240 --> 23:33.280
I wish I had been there.

23:35.120 --> 23:36.400
We need all the allies we can get.

23:38.240 --> 23:42.880
I tell you this, you're going to have to go through so much bullshit just to get health care.

23:42.880 --> 23:46.080
And all of that comes from this place of being like, oh,

23:46.080 --> 23:48.000
everybody needs to fit a strict definition.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.360
Everyone has to be in a little box.

23:51.360 --> 23:53.360
I'll do what I want and I'll help who I can.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.280
Let's talk about feminism.

23:57.280 --> 23:59.760
If there is no natural category of sex,

24:00.480 --> 24:02.480
then how can we argue for women's rights?

24:04.160 --> 24:05.840
That's a question some people are asking.

24:05.840 --> 24:07.520
And I'll admit I was curious.

24:07.520 --> 24:10.720
I've seen some say that Butler is erasing women

24:10.720 --> 24:14.400
and that in order to protect us from things like discrimination and assault,

24:14.400 --> 24:21.120
the law needs a strict definition of women grounded in facts about biological sex.

24:21.120 --> 24:25.120
Thing is, I happen to know just off my own bat that that's actually incorrect.

24:25.120 --> 24:30.800
For example, suppose an employer denies a job to a candidate named Hillary because they think,

24:30.800 --> 24:35.920
oh, women, women be shopping, women are unreliable employees, application denied.

24:35.920 --> 24:39.760
Only it turns out Hillary is Hillary with one L. The candidate is a man.

24:40.480 --> 24:43.680
In that case, the employer can still be guilty of sexual discrimination,

24:43.680 --> 24:47.760
even though their definition of what a woman is, is false and didn't even apply.

24:48.320 --> 24:51.360
The same principle also goes in crimes like assault.

24:51.360 --> 24:54.880
If a straight person gets attacked coming out of a gay club,

24:54.880 --> 24:58.080
that can still be a homophobic hate crime if the suspect

24:58.080 --> 25:02.000
believes that they're gay and attacks them for that reason.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.120
What matters in law is the suspect's actions and motivations,

25:05.120 --> 25:07.600
not whether the victim meets a particular definition.

25:07.600 --> 25:10.400
Even though this is a matter of settled law,

25:11.040 --> 25:16.160
some people still insist that a strict definition is required,

25:17.040 --> 25:20.880
almost like those people aren't listening.

25:23.600 --> 25:29.040
But anyway, wouldn't it still be useful to have some definition of women,

25:29.040 --> 25:32.240
even if we all know it's kind of vague and loose?

25:32.240 --> 25:35.520
Could it be useful as a political standard to rally around?

25:35.520 --> 25:40.640
I read Butler's 1991 paper, Imitation and Gender Subordination,

25:40.640 --> 25:43.200
which is partly about this definition question.

25:43.840 --> 25:46.960
They say that defining womanhood has been,

25:46.960 --> 25:50.560
and still is, a key strategy of patriarchy.

25:50.560 --> 25:52.960
And that's what de Beauvoir was writing about in the 40s.

25:53.520 --> 25:59.040
Trying to set an exact definition is always going to be an exclusionary project,

25:59.040 --> 26:03.440
whereas a certain amount of grey area would be more inclusive.

26:03.440 --> 26:07.520
Indeed, they say that any category like gay, lesbian, trans,

26:08.400 --> 26:11.280
femboy, imposes limits.

26:11.280 --> 26:14.720
And trying to make everybody fit one specific box

26:14.720 --> 26:18.400
as if they must have some inner self that corresponds to one of them

26:18.960 --> 26:20.400
is just a bad idea.

26:20.400 --> 26:23.040
And I understood where Butler was coming from there.

26:23.680 --> 26:28.560
In Britain, trans people are often expected to tell doctors

26:28.560 --> 26:30.800
a certain story about our lives.

26:30.880 --> 26:33.760
We're supposed to say, oh, ever since I was a child,

26:33.760 --> 26:35.920
I called myself Wendy and wore my mother's dresses,

26:35.920 --> 26:37.840
and if your life doesn't fit that narrative,

26:38.480 --> 26:40.160
it can be very hard to get medical care.

26:41.120 --> 26:46.160
The concept of an authentic inner self that needs to be discovered

26:46.160 --> 26:50.400
and verified and checked and meet somebody else's definition

26:51.040 --> 26:52.800
is used against a fact.

26:52.800 --> 26:57.120
Identity categories tend to be instruments of regulatory regimes,

26:57.200 --> 27:01.120
whether as the normalizing categories of oppressive structures

27:01.120 --> 27:06.400
or as the rallying points for a liberatory contestation of that very oppression.

27:06.400 --> 27:10.320
That is not to say that I will not appear at political occasions

27:10.320 --> 27:12.080
under the sign of lesbian,

27:12.080 --> 27:15.280
but that I would like to have it permanently unclear

27:15.280 --> 27:18.000
what precisely that sign signifies.

27:18.000 --> 27:21.760
Which version of lesbian or gay ought to be rendered visible

27:21.760 --> 27:26.160
and which internal exclusions will that rendering visible institute?

27:26.160 --> 27:30.000
Can the visibility of identity suffice as a political strategy?

27:30.000 --> 27:34.160
Or can it only be the starting point for a strategic intervention

27:34.160 --> 27:37.040
which calls for a transformation of policy?

27:37.040 --> 27:40.400
Is it not a sign of despair over public politics

27:40.400 --> 27:43.120
when identity becomes its own policy,

27:43.120 --> 27:46.560
bringing with it those who would police it from various sides?

27:47.120 --> 27:48.240
You know what else to tell you, man?

27:49.280 --> 27:52.240
Change is difficult, but it is possible.

27:53.120 --> 27:54.480
This is going to f**k up our career.

27:55.440 --> 27:56.320
On the contrary.

27:57.280 --> 27:58.640
It's going to f**k up our love life.

28:00.400 --> 28:01.280
On the contrary.

28:02.400 --> 28:06.000
Well look, as far as anyone knows right now,

28:06.640 --> 28:09.840
I'm a cis-het white guy, right?

28:09.840 --> 28:11.360
Like I'm top of the pile.

28:11.920 --> 28:14.320
Surely it would be easier to not change.

28:14.320 --> 28:16.160
Oh yeah, way easier.

28:17.360 --> 28:19.360
If you want to be depressed every day of your life

28:19.360 --> 28:20.960
and kill yourself at 35.

28:20.960 --> 28:21.760
You know what I mean?

28:22.560 --> 28:25.360
Politically things aren't great in my time.

28:25.920 --> 28:28.320
I assume in the future they do not vastly improve.

28:29.040 --> 28:31.520
Let's talk about 9-11 and dicks.

28:32.080 --> 28:35.760
Oh this is where things get silly and then they get very not silly.

28:35.760 --> 28:39.200
A penis is an organ of the human body.

28:39.200 --> 28:42.080
It has nerves and blood vessels and skin and so on.

28:42.080 --> 28:47.040
Its primary function is to allow women who have one to pee standing up

28:47.040 --> 28:50.080
if the toilet of the train carriage that you're in is really gross.

28:52.480 --> 28:53.920
And it also does some other stuff.

28:53.920 --> 28:55.520
Remember what we said earlier though?

28:55.520 --> 28:57.760
It's not that there's the physical organ

28:57.760 --> 29:01.520
and then a bunch of other social constructee stuff on top.

29:01.520 --> 29:04.480
According to Butler, we can only know the body

29:04.480 --> 29:07.760
through the social world of symbolic meanings.

29:07.760 --> 29:12.000
So that particular organ often means power,

29:12.000 --> 29:15.600
strength, domination, particularly when used for penetration,

29:15.600 --> 29:17.920
and the threat of male violence.

29:18.640 --> 29:22.000
That bundle of cultural and symbolic meanings

29:22.000 --> 29:24.640
is what philosophers call the phallus.

29:24.640 --> 29:26.400
Can a woman have a penis?

29:26.400 --> 29:29.200
This question was a fad in British media a year or two ago.

29:29.200 --> 29:32.240
Journalists kept ambushing politicians with it and watching them struggle.

29:32.240 --> 29:33.600
But really the answer is quite simple.

29:34.160 --> 29:38.320
In Britain, you can change your legal sex without surgery.

29:38.320 --> 29:42.560
Because international human rights law recognizes it's probably morally wrong

29:42.560 --> 29:45.200
to make a certain group of people undergo expensive, difficult,

29:45.200 --> 29:47.280
potentially risky invasive medical procedures

29:47.280 --> 29:50.480
that they may not want in order to do things like get married.

29:50.480 --> 29:53.200
So if you are assigned male at birth,

29:53.200 --> 29:55.360
you can change your legal sex in Britain

29:55.360 --> 29:57.440
and become a woman without surgery.

29:58.000 --> 30:01.840
It's not an easy process, but surgery isn't mandatory.

30:02.960 --> 30:05.200
If you like your dick, you can keep it.

30:05.200 --> 30:07.200
Beyond the legal situation though,

30:07.200 --> 30:10.560
if a person assigned male takes feminizing hormones,

30:10.560 --> 30:13.360
then their body will change and that includes their genitals,

30:13.360 --> 30:15.200
which can change a lot more than you might think.

30:15.760 --> 30:18.560
In some cases, it essentially becomes a large clitoris

30:18.560 --> 30:20.800
incapable of erection or penetration.

30:20.800 --> 30:24.400
And whether you want to call that a female penis or a feminine penis

30:24.400 --> 30:26.800
or whether you think there's not much distinction there,

30:26.800 --> 30:30.000
legally and medically, the facts are in.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.120
Can a woman have a penis?

30:31.840 --> 30:32.560
Yeah.

30:32.560 --> 30:37.520
And yet, people who haven't experienced all that for themselves

30:38.160 --> 30:41.760
often don't listen to those who have.

30:41.760 --> 30:45.040
Maybe you were giggling when I told you all of that stuff.

30:45.600 --> 30:48.480
The idea of a female penis is so unimaginable

30:48.480 --> 30:50.720
that it's like a punchline, right?

30:51.520 --> 30:53.280
Despite the fact that it is just a normal thing

30:53.280 --> 30:54.080
that some people have.

30:55.040 --> 30:57.680
It appears funny and unexpected.

30:58.240 --> 31:02.240
The idea of resignifying that, using it differently,

31:02.240 --> 31:05.680
but not wrongly, not powerful, not for penetration,

31:05.680 --> 31:09.680
not even male, appears to be almost a contradiction

31:10.640 --> 31:14.720
because that bundle of cultural and symbolic meanings

31:14.720 --> 31:19.040
has been naturalized, made to seem natural.

31:20.160 --> 31:21.760
And this is a very common mistake.

31:22.960 --> 31:26.080
We might even call it a fallacy.

31:27.200 --> 31:33.200
All of this is deeply funny until the second it affects government policy.

31:34.800 --> 31:38.080
In February 2023, British Justice Secretary Dominic Robb

31:38.160 --> 31:41.840
announced that from now on, women who have male genitalia

31:41.840 --> 31:44.800
who are arrested will be sent to a men's prison,

31:44.800 --> 31:46.400
regardless of what we look like,

31:46.400 --> 31:48.960
regardless of whether we have legally changed sex

31:48.960 --> 31:51.680
and regardless of what we are charged with.

31:51.680 --> 31:55.040
If, for example, I was arrested at a protest,

31:55.040 --> 31:57.120
if I was wrongfully arrested for something,

31:57.680 --> 31:59.360
I would be sent to a men's prison.

32:00.320 --> 32:02.720
And I'm sure you can imagine, although you may not want to,

32:03.760 --> 32:04.880
how that might go.

32:04.880 --> 32:07.920
There isn't really any good kind of prison,

32:08.560 --> 32:12.880
but this policy makes prison worse for a certain section of the population

32:12.880 --> 32:14.320
because of the way that we are born.

32:14.320 --> 32:17.920
And in that regard, it's ethically unusual.

32:17.920 --> 32:20.000
It's normally a principle of justice

32:20.000 --> 32:22.640
that similar crimes should carry similar sentences,

32:22.640 --> 32:24.560
but in my home country,

32:24.560 --> 32:27.920
the same crime might carry a much harsher prison sentence

32:27.920 --> 32:29.040
if you're a trans woman.

32:29.760 --> 32:32.320
This discrimination is justified by politicians

32:32.320 --> 32:36.400
by appealing to the supposed threat that penises carry.

32:36.400 --> 32:40.160
But remember, it's regardless of our crime

32:40.720 --> 32:43.280
or what our particular bodies are capable of.

32:44.080 --> 32:46.080
And that's quite philosophically interesting.

32:46.080 --> 32:47.680
They say that we are a threat,

32:48.560 --> 32:53.840
but they are not listening to any actual facts about us.

32:53.840 --> 32:55.840
Since that 2023 announcement,

32:55.840 --> 32:58.320
I'd been trying to understand and listen

32:58.320 --> 33:00.160
to the justice secretary's perspective

33:00.800 --> 33:02.080
and work my way through the fear.

33:02.720 --> 33:06.240
So the next item on my reading list was Butler's 2003 volume

33:06.240 --> 33:07.600
Precarious Life.

33:08.320 --> 33:12.000
They write about 9-11 and the war on terror.

33:12.000 --> 33:15.360
In particular, the people who were detained indefinitely

33:15.360 --> 33:17.840
in Guantanamo Bay by the U.S. government.

33:18.400 --> 33:20.240
Terror suspects.

33:20.240 --> 33:22.160
And suspects is a key word there,

33:22.160 --> 33:24.960
because many of those imprisoned were never given a trial.

33:24.960 --> 33:27.200
Some of them were never even charged.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.560
The government said those people had to be imprisoned

33:30.560 --> 33:31.760
because they were dangerous,

33:32.480 --> 33:37.600
but not the kind of danger that they could prove in a trial.

33:38.160 --> 33:40.400
The danger that these prisoners are said to pose

33:40.400 --> 33:43.040
is unlike dangers that might be substantiated

33:43.040 --> 33:45.680
in a court of law and redressed through punishment.

33:45.680 --> 33:50.000
Establishing dangerousness is not the same as establishing guilt.

33:50.640 --> 33:54.000
A certain level of dangerousness takes a human being

33:54.000 --> 33:55.920
outside the bounds of law

33:55.920 --> 33:59.600
and even outside the bounds of the military tribunal itself

33:59.600 --> 34:02.240
makes that human into the state's possession,

34:02.800 --> 34:04.080
infinitely detainable.

34:04.800 --> 34:10.080
What counts as dangerous is what is deemed dangerous by the state,

34:10.080 --> 34:14.560
so that, once again, the state posits what is dangerous

34:14.560 --> 34:17.200
and in so doing establishes the conditions

34:17.200 --> 34:19.760
for its own preemption and usurpation of the law.

34:20.320 --> 34:22.560
If a person is deemed dangerous,

34:23.360 --> 34:26.640
then it is no longer a matter of deciding whether criminal acts occurred.

34:27.200 --> 34:32.080
Indeed, deeming someone dangerous is an unsubstantiated judgment

34:32.080 --> 34:35.520
that in these cases works to preempt determinations

34:35.520 --> 34:37.440
for which evidence is required.

34:38.000 --> 34:41.040
If you're very clever, you'll already have realised

34:41.040 --> 34:44.160
that when governments call people dangerous in this way,

34:44.800 --> 34:47.040
they're using performative speech.

34:47.920 --> 34:50.320
They say it, and they make it so.

34:50.320 --> 34:54.400
But what's happening here isn't subjectification,

34:55.200 --> 35:00.000
it's abjectification, creating non-subjects,

35:00.000 --> 35:02.800
non-people who exist outside the law

35:02.800 --> 35:05.440
and who can therefore be treated any way the government likes.

35:05.440 --> 35:08.000
We don't need trials and evidence for them

35:08.000 --> 35:09.360
because they're the bad guys.

35:10.160 --> 35:12.560
If they have their rights violated or they die,

35:12.560 --> 35:14.240
well, you shouldn't care about that

35:14.240 --> 35:17.760
because they were never really alive in a way that mattered.

35:17.760 --> 35:20.720
In fact, if you do care about what happens to them,

35:20.720 --> 35:21.840
then that's suspicious.

35:23.200 --> 35:28.240
You're not going to sympathise with the bad guys, are you?

35:28.240 --> 35:31.520
If you've been watching the news lately, you might be wondering,

35:32.080 --> 35:34.800
the people of Gaza keep being killed,

35:34.800 --> 35:37.680
but Western governments aren't listening.

35:38.240 --> 35:41.360
Is that maybe an example of abjectification?

35:41.360 --> 35:44.480
And according to Butler, the answer is yes.

35:44.480 --> 35:47.040
They are a longtime supporter of Palestinian rights

35:47.040 --> 35:50.320
and have often used their position as a public Jewish academic

35:50.320 --> 35:53.120
to call on the Israeli government to meet their obligations

35:53.120 --> 35:55.120
under international human rights law.

35:55.120 --> 35:58.800
Butler says abjectification is a tool of government

35:58.800 --> 36:01.920
in the 21st century that we need to watch out for.

36:02.560 --> 36:05.440
When the powers that be say a certain group of people

36:05.440 --> 36:07.360
are inherently dangerous,

36:07.360 --> 36:10.480
whether they're Muslims or Palestinians or trans people,

36:10.480 --> 36:14.000
that's them trying to use performative speech

36:14.000 --> 36:17.680
to make that group of people impossible to listen to.

36:18.320 --> 36:21.840
We become not subjects, but abjects.

36:22.560 --> 36:25.760
A problem to be managed against our will

36:25.760 --> 36:30.720
in the name of a public good that does not recognise us as part of the public.

36:31.600 --> 36:34.240
And I'm not drawing a moral equivalence between those three groups,

36:34.240 --> 36:36.640
I'm just highlighting this technique of government,

36:36.640 --> 36:38.000
making you aware of it,

36:38.000 --> 36:40.320
because you never know when the powers that be

36:40.320 --> 36:43.040
might decide to use it on you.

36:43.520 --> 36:45.600
Yeah, you're right about that.

36:47.200 --> 36:48.800
Politics in the future gets weird.

36:50.400 --> 36:51.360
How do you mean weird?

36:55.520 --> 36:57.120
Let's talk about JK Rowling.

37:06.880 --> 37:09.920
We come at last to Butler's new book,

37:10.880 --> 37:14.240
Who's Afraid of Gender.

37:14.880 --> 37:18.560
In recent years, scholars have been studying the rise

37:18.560 --> 37:21.440
of the global anti-gender movement,

37:22.080 --> 37:25.760
a network of people including far-right political actors,

37:25.760 --> 37:27.200
religious fundamentalists,

37:27.920 --> 37:29.920
and a lot of people who are neither.

37:30.880 --> 37:34.880
Sometimes it's a literal network of politicians and activists

37:34.880 --> 37:36.720
working together behind the scenes,

37:36.720 --> 37:39.360
but sometimes it's more of a loose association.

37:40.080 --> 37:42.960
They oppose women's rights, especially abortion,

37:42.960 --> 37:47.520
LGBTQ rights, and they strongly oppose trans people.

37:47.520 --> 37:51.200
There is a part of the movement that emerged from radical feminism,

37:51.200 --> 37:52.960
and that part tends to get a lot of attention,

37:52.960 --> 37:54.560
especially here on YouTube.

37:54.560 --> 37:57.440
Here's three great videos if you're interested,

37:57.440 --> 37:59.680
but the movement as a whole is mainly men

37:59.680 --> 38:03.120
and supports policies that would harm the vast majority of women.

38:03.680 --> 38:06.000
Women play an important role in selling it

38:06.000 --> 38:07.760
and helping it appear benign

38:07.760 --> 38:10.880
because protecting women is always good PR,

38:11.440 --> 38:13.440
but they aren't the core.

38:13.440 --> 38:17.200
The core is the fight against gender ideology,

38:18.000 --> 38:21.360
but there's not much agreement on what that actually means.

38:22.160 --> 38:24.640
In Eastern Europe, they say that gender ideology

38:24.640 --> 38:27.280
is spread by the UN and the EU,

38:27.280 --> 38:30.480
but in Italy, they say it's spread by African migrants.

38:31.200 --> 38:34.000
In Latin America, gender ideology means feminism,

38:34.000 --> 38:36.480
but in the UK, they say it's against feminism.

38:36.560 --> 38:38.080
In Florida, they say it's gay.

38:38.080 --> 38:40.000
In the UK, they say it's homophobic.

38:40.000 --> 38:43.200
They say that gender ideology is the new conversion therapy,

38:43.200 --> 38:47.680
but some anti-gender organisations are in favour of conversion therapy.

38:47.680 --> 38:50.240
Gender ideology is spread by woke students

38:50.240 --> 38:52.320
with blue hair and safe spaces,

38:52.320 --> 38:55.600
but it's also being pushed on innocent students by wicked professors.

38:55.600 --> 38:58.720
Children must not be indoctrinated into gender ideology,

38:58.720 --> 39:01.520
and so the government must make sure children believe

39:01.520 --> 39:03.600
the things it says about gender,

39:03.600 --> 39:06.240
but all of this is deeply confusing.

39:07.120 --> 39:10.480
The Oxford English Dictionary defines gender ideology as...

39:14.560 --> 39:17.760
Although gender ideology is a vague term,

39:17.760 --> 39:21.200
there are recurring themes in how it is used.

39:21.840 --> 39:24.560
One such theme is the idea that gender

39:24.560 --> 39:29.840
is in some way unnatural or artificial or fake,

39:29.840 --> 39:36.240
a contested belief, unlike biological sex and family values

39:36.320 --> 39:39.600
which definitely are natural.

39:40.160 --> 39:44.640
Another theme is that gender ideologues, whoever they are,

39:44.640 --> 39:47.920
are powerful, commanding your obedience,

39:47.920 --> 39:52.560
but also very sneaky, capturing institutions behind the scenes.

39:52.560 --> 39:54.080
And the sneakiness is important,

39:54.080 --> 39:57.040
because it allows the movement to claim gender ideologues

39:57.040 --> 39:59.120
or doing all sorts of nefarious things

39:59.120 --> 40:00.960
that they have no evidence for,

40:00.960 --> 40:02.400
but the reason they have no evidence

40:02.400 --> 40:04.080
is because they're so gosh darn sneaky.

40:04.880 --> 40:08.480
Self-victimization plays a huge role here.

40:08.480 --> 40:09.760
Another reason there's no evidence

40:09.760 --> 40:12.480
is because ordinary people are being bullied

40:12.480 --> 40:15.120
into silence by the woke genderists.

40:15.840 --> 40:19.040
Sometimes this verges into outright conspiracy theory.

40:19.040 --> 40:20.960
There are people in my country,

40:20.960 --> 40:23.760
people with serious political and media careers,

40:23.760 --> 40:26.720
who've claimed that our civil service and healthcare

40:26.720 --> 40:30.160
are secretly being run by the trans deep state,

40:30.160 --> 40:33.360
which frankly, I wish that were true.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.800
The final theme is the danger

40:36.800 --> 40:39.920
that gender ideology apparently poses.

40:39.920 --> 40:44.400
Whatever it is, it's a threat to women who are erased

40:44.400 --> 40:47.040
and to men who are made weak and helpless,

40:47.040 --> 40:49.520
to families and to children in particular

40:49.520 --> 40:52.080
who are confused or preyed upon.

40:52.080 --> 40:53.280
It's a threat to the nation,

40:53.280 --> 40:56.080
because you see gender makes us weak to communism,

40:56.080 --> 40:58.240
or capitalism, or Vladimir Putin,

40:58.240 --> 41:01.040
or Western influence, or Islamic migrants.

41:01.040 --> 41:03.840
It's a threat to the existence of humanity

41:03.840 --> 41:07.120
and the authority of God himself.

41:07.120 --> 41:09.200
The Vatican has actually claimed that.

41:09.200 --> 41:10.560
No exaggeration.

41:10.560 --> 41:15.680
Pope Francis compared gender ideology to nuclear weapons.

41:15.680 --> 41:19.120
It kind of just means the opposite of how things should be,

41:20.000 --> 41:24.240
and the way they should be is whatever you personally want.

41:25.040 --> 41:27.280
And that's a very effective strategy,

41:27.280 --> 41:29.040
because it allows people who previously

41:29.040 --> 41:32.000
might not have associated to stand together.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.400
The movement features conservative Catholics,

41:34.400 --> 41:37.920
men's rights activists, neo-Nazis, new age types,

41:37.920 --> 41:40.880
centrists, liberals, and even some feminists.

41:40.880 --> 41:43.120
And it's good at radicalizing them too.

41:43.760 --> 41:46.400
Gender ideology seems like such a big threat.

41:46.400 --> 41:49.280
It can't be stopped by traditional means.

41:49.280 --> 41:51.200
We have to get tough.

41:51.760 --> 41:54.960
Much of the blame for starting the anti-gender movement

41:54.960 --> 41:57.760
belongs, I'm afraid, to Catholics.

41:58.320 --> 42:00.240
Since the least the 1980s,

42:00.240 --> 42:03.200
conservative Catholics, both within and without the church,

42:03.200 --> 42:06.800
have said that gender ideology threatens the family and God.

42:07.360 --> 42:10.400
They use this claim as justification for their extreme

42:10.400 --> 42:13.680
authoritarian positions on abortion and queerness,

42:13.680 --> 42:15.040
among other things.

42:15.040 --> 42:18.640
It was Catholics who first started the conspiracy theory

42:18.640 --> 42:23.760
that the UN are secretly pushing an anti-Christian gender agenda.

42:23.840 --> 42:27.360
The Catholic Church has also claimed several times

42:27.360 --> 42:29.760
in writing, without evidence,

42:29.760 --> 42:33.360
that gender ideology leads to the abuse of children.

42:34.960 --> 42:39.360
An IMAX level act of projection that might honestly be funny

42:39.360 --> 42:41.680
if it weren't so insulting to the intelligence

42:41.680 --> 42:44.320
of every human being on planet Earth.

42:44.320 --> 42:48.080
Religion still plays a big role in driving anti-gender sentiment,

42:48.080 --> 42:50.960
especially in the Americas and Eastern Europe.

42:51.040 --> 42:53.680
In Britain, our version is a little more secular,

42:53.680 --> 42:55.600
but that's not the case everywhere.

42:55.600 --> 42:58.240
It's just, we don't go in for Catholicism

42:58.240 --> 42:59.200
as much as we used to.

43:01.360 --> 43:05.360
But it would be unfair to lay the blame on all Catholics.

43:05.360 --> 43:07.520
Evangelicals are getting involved too,

43:07.520 --> 43:10.960
and indeed, some ordinary Catholics might be getting scarred.

43:14.560 --> 43:16.720
I have to be careful what I say here.

43:16.720 --> 43:20.160
I can tell you that religion also plays a role

43:20.160 --> 43:22.160
in how the movement is funded.

43:22.800 --> 43:26.000
The Piotr Skarga Association, a Polish group

43:26.000 --> 43:28.880
who oppose abortion and LGBTQ rights,

43:28.880 --> 43:32.160
have raised millions of euros selling rosaries

43:32.160 --> 43:35.600
and pictures of saints to Catholics around the world

43:35.600 --> 43:36.720
via mail order.

43:37.440 --> 43:41.360
And legally, I can't say that's a scam.

43:42.480 --> 43:46.000
Maybe everyone who gives them money knows what they use it for.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.520
Maybe when a little French grandma

43:47.520 --> 43:50.400
in Toulouse buys a calendar with the Virgin Mary on it,

43:50.400 --> 43:52.800
she knows full well that her money is going

43:52.800 --> 43:54.880
to an extreme right-wing organization in Poland

43:54.880 --> 43:56.960
who are going to send some of it to anti-abortion groups

43:56.960 --> 43:59.360
in Brazil and spend the rest on luxury properties.

44:00.800 --> 44:02.640
Grandma probably did her research.

44:03.680 --> 44:07.120
And she'd have to, because their adverts don't mention it,

44:07.120 --> 44:08.880
and Piotr Skarga's financial documents

44:08.880 --> 44:10.800
were hidden from the public until journalists

44:10.800 --> 44:12.640
broke this story in 2020.

44:12.640 --> 44:14.880
Speaking of Catholic crimes, though,

44:14.880 --> 44:18.400
the narrative is that gender ideology is being pushed

44:18.400 --> 44:21.200
on the good people of the world by shadowy elites

44:21.200 --> 44:22.480
who are pulling the strings.

44:23.120 --> 44:25.280
And at this point in my reading, I was thinking,

44:25.280 --> 44:27.280
well, that sounds a lot like anti-Semitism.

44:27.840 --> 44:30.240
And yes, there are some parts of the movement

44:30.240 --> 44:32.640
that are explicitly anti-Semitic.

44:32.640 --> 44:36.240
For example, neo-Nazis have criticized Judith Butler

44:36.240 --> 44:39.600
for being a Jewish lesbian who invented gender

44:39.600 --> 44:41.120
to weaken the West.

44:41.120 --> 44:42.880
But then I read this.

44:43.760 --> 44:46.080
Anti-gender politics in the populist moment

44:46.080 --> 44:49.280
by Polish scholars Agnieszka Graf and Albert Kolszuk.

44:49.280 --> 44:53.760
They say not all anti-genderists are secretly anti-Semitic.

44:53.760 --> 44:56.240
The reason they can look similar

44:56.240 --> 44:58.640
is because they do similar things.

44:59.520 --> 45:03.360
Objectify, make a certain group of people

45:03.360 --> 45:05.280
impossible to listen to.

45:05.840 --> 45:09.840
Though Jews are almost never mentioned in a text on gender ideology,

45:09.920 --> 45:12.560
genderists and especially sexual minorities

45:12.560 --> 45:15.840
are consistently Judaized in anti-gender discourse.

45:15.840 --> 45:18.640
That is, described in a language strongly reminiscent

45:18.640 --> 45:21.040
of conspiratorial anti-Semitism.

45:21.040 --> 45:24.720
The link becomes most obvious when Soros and Butler are mentioned,

45:24.720 --> 45:27.360
or when the term cultural Marxism,

45:27.360 --> 45:30.240
notorious for its anti-Semitic subtext, is employed.

45:30.800 --> 45:32.880
Like Jews and anti-Semitic attacks,

45:32.880 --> 45:36.160
sexual minorities are presented as engaged in a secretive plot.

45:36.720 --> 45:40.160
They are scheming, devious and powerful.

45:40.160 --> 45:43.680
To this end, the term homosexual lobby is often used

45:43.680 --> 45:47.200
and the link between homosexuality and cosmopolitanism

45:47.200 --> 45:49.600
or rootlessness is persistently made.

45:50.560 --> 45:55.200
Furthermore, LGBT activists are routinely accused of sacrilege.

45:55.200 --> 45:58.880
Their very presence is said to contaminate sacred events and spaces,

45:58.880 --> 46:01.040
while the rainbow flag is seen as offensive

46:01.040 --> 46:04.240
to religious sensibilities and patriotic feelings.

46:04.240 --> 46:07.920
Finally, like Jews and pre-World War II Eastern Europe,

46:07.920 --> 46:10.560
gays are blamed for provoking violent attacks

46:10.560 --> 46:12.640
by making themselves too conspicuous.

46:13.760 --> 46:15.520
We're in the eye of the storm a lot.

46:16.560 --> 46:20.960
I mean queer people generally, but sometimes us specifically.

46:23.280 --> 46:25.600
Sometimes it feels like being under a big microscope.

46:29.360 --> 46:32.160
Do you remember when we were studying theology at university?

46:33.040 --> 46:34.160
Yeah, just about.

46:36.160 --> 46:39.440
We had this one lecturer who taught us about Genesis.

46:40.800 --> 46:45.040
Remember, he said, you are created.

46:46.160 --> 46:47.520
You are a creature.

46:47.520 --> 46:49.200
Yeah, I do remember that.

46:49.200 --> 46:50.960
I didn't like that word creature.

46:52.720 --> 46:54.960
Yeah, we belong to us.

46:56.080 --> 46:57.680
We decide what we do.

46:58.240 --> 47:02.240
Well, if it God does exist, it seems you've got notes.

47:05.440 --> 47:07.600
That's all very interesting,

47:07.600 --> 47:13.600
but it doesn't explain why the anti-gender movement just doesn't listen.

47:13.600 --> 47:16.400
Remember back at the start when we learned about the school board

47:16.400 --> 47:19.680
who turned down $10,000 of free money?

47:19.680 --> 47:22.320
Remember how the same misunderstandings of Butler's work

47:22.320 --> 47:24.000
have circulated for decades?

47:24.000 --> 47:26.400
Remember the insistence that the law was made

47:27.120 --> 47:29.200
that the law must have a strict definition of women,

47:29.200 --> 47:30.880
even though we know that's not true?

47:30.880 --> 47:32.880
Remember all those unevidence conspiracies

47:32.880 --> 47:36.720
about the trans deep state and secret UN plots?

47:36.720 --> 47:40.480
There's something else too that's very interesting.

47:41.280 --> 47:45.120
The language that the anti-gender movement uses is very

47:46.000 --> 47:52.720
actioning, threat, infiltration, danger, bullying, silencing, censorship,

47:52.720 --> 47:54.560
a comparison to nuclear weapons.

47:55.200 --> 47:56.560
It's not just that they're not listening.

47:57.280 --> 47:58.800
When they're invited to listen,

47:59.520 --> 48:02.080
it seems like that makes them feel as if they're under attack.

48:03.040 --> 48:04.720
And Butler has an explanation for this.

48:05.600 --> 48:10.320
They say that these people are caught in a phantasm.

48:11.040 --> 48:14.240
Phantasm is a technical philosophy term

48:14.240 --> 48:17.760
for a particular way of misinterpreting the world

48:17.760 --> 48:20.560
by projecting your feelings onto it.

48:21.280 --> 48:24.400
Philosopher Michael Nass says that it's a prism

48:24.400 --> 48:28.080
that refracts an as-if into an as-so.

48:28.880 --> 48:32.000
For example, the presence of a trans person

48:32.000 --> 48:33.920
with a penis in a public bathroom

48:33.920 --> 48:38.000
makes me feel as if I am under attack becomes...

48:41.360 --> 48:43.200
I am under attack.

48:43.920 --> 48:48.400
People use phantasms to avoid cognitive dissonance

48:48.400 --> 48:50.160
in the face of anxiety.

48:50.640 --> 48:53.360
For example, literature professor Darren Tenev

48:53.360 --> 48:56.000
says we use them to help us confront death.

48:56.880 --> 48:58.720
Normally, we don't want to think about our own deaths.

48:58.720 --> 49:00.080
It makes us anxious.

49:00.080 --> 49:02.560
So when we picture our own funerals

49:02.560 --> 49:05.760
and what we would want to happen to our remains,

49:05.760 --> 49:07.680
we imagine ourselves as being gone,

49:08.320 --> 49:10.320
but also kind of still around.

49:10.320 --> 49:13.360
Like, oh, I'd love to be buried somewhere that has a nice view.

49:15.040 --> 49:16.160
Well, why?

49:16.160 --> 49:18.400
You're not going to be there to enjoy it by definition.

49:18.400 --> 49:19.760
That's a contradictory dream.

49:20.720 --> 49:23.840
But the phantasm contains that contradiction

49:24.400 --> 49:26.960
and soothes our anxiety.

49:26.960 --> 49:29.600
It is as if I will still be there.

49:32.720 --> 49:34.640
I will still be there.

49:35.360 --> 49:37.360
What is characteristic of phantasms

49:37.360 --> 49:38.800
is that they are placed

49:38.800 --> 49:41.520
and place what could be called the subject of phantasm

49:42.160 --> 49:44.480
on both sides of a border,

49:44.480 --> 49:47.040
a boundary, a limit, a frontier.

49:47.040 --> 49:49.440
When there is a border, a limitation,

49:50.000 --> 49:53.040
the phantasm lets one on the other side

49:53.040 --> 49:55.600
and not only provides a contraband access

49:55.600 --> 49:56.560
through the border,

49:56.560 --> 49:59.840
but also keeps one on both sides at the same time.

49:59.840 --> 50:02.800
There is no logic of the phantasm.

50:02.800 --> 50:04.560
The phantasm is phantasm

50:04.560 --> 50:08.160
because it allows one to stand on both sides of a border,

50:08.160 --> 50:09.280
for example,

50:09.280 --> 50:12.160
allowing one to imagine one's own corpse

50:12.160 --> 50:13.760
while still being alive.

50:14.320 --> 50:16.960
Like he says, there's no logic to this.

50:17.520 --> 50:20.960
It's an exercise in trying to not make sense

50:20.960 --> 50:22.800
because you can't handle the conclusions

50:22.800 --> 50:24.240
that you would reach if you did.

50:24.880 --> 50:26.880
That's why people caught in a phantasm

50:26.880 --> 50:28.320
will throw out all kinds of claims

50:28.320 --> 50:30.720
that it doesn't really seem like they've thought through

50:30.720 --> 50:32.400
or have any evidence for

50:32.400 --> 50:33.840
and when questioned on it,

50:33.840 --> 50:35.600
they'll say you're attacking me

50:35.600 --> 50:38.320
because they're trying really hard

50:38.320 --> 50:41.520
to not think something.

50:41.520 --> 50:43.520
But what exactly?

50:43.520 --> 50:44.800
What is the thing

50:44.800 --> 50:46.960
that the anti-gender movement doesn't want to think?

50:48.880 --> 50:51.680
Well, it'll probably be different

50:51.680 --> 50:52.880
for different individuals.

50:53.920 --> 50:56.880
J.K. Rowling has been massively radicalized

50:56.880 --> 50:58.800
into the movement in the last few years.

50:58.800 --> 51:00.400
She's made a lot of very weird

51:00.400 --> 51:02.320
and false claims about trans people

51:02.320 --> 51:04.720
and gotten very aggressive when challenged.

51:05.520 --> 51:07.840
People have speculated about her trauma,

51:07.840 --> 51:08.800
maybe causing that,

51:08.800 --> 51:11.040
but as a woman who's also survived

51:11.040 --> 51:12.000
an abusive relationship,

51:12.800 --> 51:14.160
that kind of public speculation

51:14.160 --> 51:16.240
has always felt a little bit gross to me.

51:17.120 --> 51:19.840
I don't want to do armchair psychology on anyone,

51:19.840 --> 51:21.600
even though I'm sure plenty of people

51:21.600 --> 51:22.720
would love to do some on me.

51:23.600 --> 51:26.320
It's just not the philosophy cheap way.

51:26.320 --> 51:29.200
So maybe we can ask a more general version

51:29.200 --> 51:30.400
of this same question.

51:31.120 --> 51:33.520
Why are phantasms catching on?

51:34.160 --> 51:35.440
And not just about this topic,

51:35.440 --> 51:36.960
but all sorts of things.

51:36.960 --> 51:38.080
On the previous episode,

51:38.080 --> 51:41.040
we talked about 15-minute city conspiracy theories

51:41.040 --> 51:43.040
and there's QAnon and conspiracies

51:43.040 --> 51:44.480
about the royal family.

51:44.480 --> 51:46.560
Sometimes the way that Zionists talk about

51:46.560 --> 51:48.880
Palestinians has a touch of the phantasma about it,

51:48.880 --> 51:51.280
as some Jewish scholars have noted.

51:51.280 --> 51:53.440
This is a really big issue

51:53.440 --> 51:55.040
and it would be great if we could sort

51:55.040 --> 51:56.400
the whole gender thing out

51:56.400 --> 51:59.280
because we've got a lot of real problems to deal with.

51:59.280 --> 52:01.840
We don't have time to be fighting imaginary ones.

52:04.640 --> 52:08.640
Oh, Graf and Korolchuk say

52:09.280 --> 52:11.680
there really are a lot of problems in the world.

52:12.400 --> 52:14.160
And a lot of them are systemic.

52:14.880 --> 52:16.560
A lot of women really are devalued.

52:16.560 --> 52:18.080
A lot of children really are living

52:18.080 --> 52:20.800
in an increasingly dangerous and warming world.

52:20.800 --> 52:23.120
A lot of people really do rely on their families

52:23.120 --> 52:25.040
to protect them from big institutions

52:25.040 --> 52:26.240
and economic forces

52:26.240 --> 52:28.400
that really will trample every tradition

52:28.400 --> 52:31.600
and really do dissolve everything into money.

52:31.600 --> 52:34.480
According to them, the anti-gender phantasm

52:34.480 --> 52:38.160
is an attempt to criticize the effects of capitalism

52:38.960 --> 52:42.160
without naming capitalism as the problem.

52:43.040 --> 52:45.360
People see the bad results of the system that we have,

52:46.160 --> 52:48.160
but they're invested in those same systems

52:48.720 --> 52:51.360
and so the solutions become unthinkable.

52:51.920 --> 52:53.600
Their criticisms have to be expressed

52:53.600 --> 52:56.800
as a kind of moral criticism.

52:58.080 --> 53:01.200
Anti-genderism is the socialism of fools

53:02.160 --> 53:03.680
and the feminism of fools

53:04.720 --> 53:07.280
and the anti-colonialism of fools.

53:07.280 --> 53:09.280
The anti-gender movement is so effective

53:09.280 --> 53:10.480
in attracting mass support

53:10.480 --> 53:12.400
because it is structured and legitimized

53:12.400 --> 53:15.680
as a conservative response to the excesses of neoliberalism.

53:16.560 --> 53:18.000
A crucial source of anxiety

53:18.000 --> 53:21.280
is the rampant individualism of contemporary culture,

53:21.280 --> 53:22.560
the erosion of community

53:22.560 --> 53:24.480
and growing instability of everyday life.

53:25.440 --> 53:26.880
Opponents of gender ideology

53:26.880 --> 53:29.440
attribute these trends to the influence of feminism

53:29.440 --> 53:30.640
and the sexual revolution.

53:31.360 --> 53:33.200
Anti-genderism conflates gender

53:33.200 --> 53:35.040
with those aspects of capitalism

53:35.040 --> 53:36.400
that are most frustrating

53:36.400 --> 53:38.800
to members of the working and lower middle class,

53:38.800 --> 53:40.960
especially to parents and would-be parents,

53:40.960 --> 53:42.880
precarity and the crisis of care

53:42.880 --> 53:45.120
resulting from unequal distribution of wealth.

53:45.920 --> 53:48.640
Instead of naming the problem in economic terms

53:48.640 --> 53:51.120
as injustice and exploitation,

53:51.120 --> 53:54.240
anti-genderism presents the world of capitalism's winners

53:54.240 --> 53:57.120
as degenerate and morally corrupt.

53:57.120 --> 54:00.080
And here's where we tie it all together

54:00.720 --> 54:04.000
and bring it back to Judith Butler.

54:04.720 --> 54:08.240
When the anti-gender movement say that gender is an ideology

54:08.240 --> 54:10.320
and sex is a fixed point,

54:10.320 --> 54:13.760
we now understand they aren't making an observation,

54:13.760 --> 54:15.680
they're making a demand.

54:16.480 --> 54:19.280
When they say that you can't change sex,

54:19.280 --> 54:22.640
they mean you shouldn't be allowed to

54:22.640 --> 54:24.720
because that would be dangerous,

54:24.720 --> 54:27.680
not the kind of danger that is proven with evidence,

54:27.680 --> 54:32.160
but the kind they want the state to posit and punish.

54:32.560 --> 54:35.360
What they want is morally righteous violence

54:35.360 --> 54:37.520
that restores an imaginary order

54:37.520 --> 54:39.920
because they are anxious about real problems

54:39.920 --> 54:42.720
that they cannot or will not think about,

54:42.720 --> 54:45.200
and so they can only glimpse those problems

54:45.200 --> 54:50.400
through the prism of unreality.

54:50.400 --> 54:53.920
The contradictory character of the phantasm

54:53.920 --> 54:56.640
allows it to contain whatever anxiety or fear

54:56.640 --> 54:59.200
that the anti-gender ideology wishes to stoke

54:59.200 --> 55:00.400
for its own purposes,

55:00.800 --> 55:02.960
without having to make any of it cohere.

55:02.960 --> 55:06.560
Depending on the anxieties circulating in a particular region,

55:06.560 --> 55:09.360
gender can be figured as Marxist or capitalist,

55:09.360 --> 55:13.200
tyranny or libertarianism, fascism or totalitarianism,

55:13.200 --> 55:16.400
a totalizing force, or an unwanted migrant.

55:16.400 --> 55:19.360
It is not that people are unmindful of the contradiction

55:19.360 --> 55:20.880
and need to be enlightened.

55:20.880 --> 55:23.760
No, the contradiction itself is what works,

55:23.760 --> 55:26.080
in effect emancipating people from the task

55:26.080 --> 55:28.000
of developing a rational position.

55:30.640 --> 55:34.000
Maybe it's because I'm older,

55:34.960 --> 55:38.320
but part of the reason I came back is to tell you

55:38.960 --> 55:41.920
life is too short to spend it being miserable.

55:44.000 --> 55:44.960
Actually, that's the point.

55:46.560 --> 55:48.000
How come you look younger than me?

55:49.760 --> 55:50.560
Because I'm happier.

55:51.920 --> 55:52.960
Joy is youthful.

55:54.320 --> 55:55.920
Also, we get a really good skincare routine.

55:56.720 --> 55:58.240
I don't want to think about getting older.

55:58.560 --> 56:01.520
You know mom's fish pie recipe?

56:03.680 --> 56:04.080
Yeah.

56:04.080 --> 56:06.000
There's this really amazing moment that's going to happen

56:06.000 --> 56:07.200
when you're 30.

56:07.200 --> 56:10.080
You make that fish pie for a friend who's like 23,

56:10.080 --> 56:11.680
and you bring it out and she says,

56:11.680 --> 56:13.200
you are literally my mother.

56:14.240 --> 56:15.840
And that is going to be one of the first times

56:15.840 --> 56:17.440
you realize that we're getting older.

56:18.640 --> 56:20.880
But it's actually nice because it's like,

56:21.920 --> 56:24.720
we have a knowledge that younger people don't.

56:25.840 --> 56:27.440
And it's not like a superiority thing.

56:27.440 --> 56:29.360
It's that we get to be helpful.

56:31.680 --> 56:32.720
We become an auntie.

56:34.400 --> 56:37.280
We have little nieces and a nephew.

56:39.200 --> 56:40.880
We help them put on their shoes

56:40.880 --> 56:43.200
and they ask us to tell them about Shakespeare.

56:48.080 --> 56:50.240
I wish I could tell you that it's all going to be moments like that.

56:52.400 --> 56:52.960
But you're right.

56:54.480 --> 56:56.320
Your future has ups and downs.

56:56.320 --> 56:57.680
And it's mainly ups.

56:58.960 --> 57:00.400
But the politics is big down.

57:02.640 --> 57:03.440
Does it get better?

57:09.440 --> 57:11.360
Let's talk about Brainworms.

57:12.720 --> 57:15.680
Brainworms is a 2024 novel by Alison Rumford

57:15.680 --> 57:18.400
about a woman who discovers that several high-ranking British politicians

57:18.400 --> 57:20.480
and journalists are being secretly controlled

57:20.480 --> 57:23.120
by a contagious parasite that makes them bigoted.

57:23.120 --> 57:24.960
She has to uncover the conspiracy,

57:24.960 --> 57:26.000
but nobody will believe her.

57:26.320 --> 57:28.400
Because she's working class and trans.

57:29.200 --> 57:30.480
And maybe imagining it.

57:31.760 --> 57:34.560
I like that the worms are never confirmed to be real.

57:35.600 --> 57:38.000
We could read them as hallucinations.

57:39.040 --> 57:42.080
That ambiguity forces us to engage only with the metaphor.

57:42.800 --> 57:44.080
Brainworms might not be real,

57:45.040 --> 57:51.680
but hate is infectious, disgusting, and perverse.

57:51.680 --> 57:53.920
One character is a famous author

57:53.920 --> 57:56.400
who writes books about teenage witches.

57:59.200 --> 58:01.920
There's a scene where she infects someone else,

58:01.920 --> 58:05.760
coming close to her victim, worms dripping from her open mouth.

58:05.760 --> 58:07.200
And she says a line.

58:07.760 --> 58:09.440
And in the movie version, this would be the line

58:09.440 --> 58:12.240
that reveals a glimpse of her evil plan, right?

58:12.960 --> 58:14.080
But instead, she says,

58:15.440 --> 58:17.600
I've seen the future of this country.

58:19.040 --> 58:23.360
And it's going to get so much worse.

58:24.800 --> 58:26.320
The worms don't make her happy.

58:26.320 --> 58:28.320
In fact, they're a kind of contagious misery.

58:29.600 --> 58:32.960
Nobody who is infected ever gets better.

58:33.600 --> 58:38.400
So what can we do about all of the things that we have learned today?

58:38.400 --> 58:40.960
Well, there's actually two questions rolled into one there.

58:40.960 --> 58:43.600
The first is, what can we practically do

58:43.600 --> 58:45.920
about the political situation that we're all living in?

58:45.920 --> 58:48.560
And secondly, can we convince people

58:48.560 --> 58:51.120
who are stuck inside phantasms?

58:51.840 --> 58:55.680
So first things first, practically speaking, what can we do?

58:55.680 --> 58:57.920
Well, if you've been watching this show for any amount of time,

58:57.920 --> 59:00.560
you know that I hate telling people what to do or think.

59:00.560 --> 59:04.240
But here's some suggestions, maybe.

59:04.240 --> 59:07.920
If you're Catholic and you like buying little medals

59:07.920 --> 59:11.440
or rosaries or chuchkies, if you have relatives who do,

59:11.440 --> 59:12.960
maybe older relatives who do,

59:13.840 --> 59:16.960
you might like to double check where that money is going.

59:16.960 --> 59:18.560
If you happen to work in media,

59:18.720 --> 59:23.600
that all of this theory could have some practical applications for you,

59:23.600 --> 59:25.840
we might like to talk about anti-genderists

59:25.840 --> 59:29.120
the same way we talk about anti-vaxxers or climate deniers.

59:29.120 --> 59:33.200
For example, Mrs. X says this, which is false.

59:33.200 --> 59:36.800
Organization Y claims this, which is pseudoscience.

59:36.800 --> 59:38.800
Another thing that you might like to try

59:38.800 --> 59:41.680
is using the word cisgender.

59:41.680 --> 59:43.200
It was coined in the early 90s.

59:43.200 --> 59:45.520
It means not transgender.

59:45.520 --> 59:48.640
And the English language anti-gender movement hate it

59:48.640 --> 59:52.160
because it implies that trans people and cis people

59:52.160 --> 59:54.720
are both worth listening to.

59:55.440 --> 59:59.520
It resists objectification by putting us on an even playing field.

59:59.520 --> 01:00:02.720
Kind of like using the word straight or heterosexual

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:04.320
instead of saying normal.

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:08.400
Beyond that, Graf and Karl Schuch say we need to appreciate the fact

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:12.320
that right-wing populism is criticizing capitalism,

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:14.640
albeit in phantasmic terms.

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:16.720
They say we should move beyond the old idea

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:18.320
that the left are anti-capitalist

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:20.720
and the right are always pro-market.

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:23.200
Now some of them are, to be sure, but not all.

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:25.440
They say that these days a lot of people on the right

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:27.440
are actually criticizing capitalism

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:30.080
even if they don't use that kind of language.

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:33.040
And so sticking to the same old economic policies

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:34.480
we've had for the last 40 years

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:38.560
is leaving yourself wide open to those far right extremists.

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:42.320
They also say that LGBTQ stuff and gender stuff

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:45.600
can't really be separated from normal politics anymore

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:48.400
because that's how a lot of people are engaging

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.800
with normal politics these days.

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:53.360
The anti-gender phantasm isn't the only thing

01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:55.520
powering the global right, to be sure,

01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:57.520
but it's big enough that it can't be ignored.

01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:01.360
Important lessons there for centrists, perhaps.

01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:05.040
They recommend a strategy called populist feminism

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:08.800
which involves tapping into people's emotions in the moment.

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:11.120
An example from the UK might be the group

01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:13.520
Sisters Uncut who've been very successful

01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:17.200
mobilizing a broad coalition against austerity,

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:20.160
domestic violence cuts, police violence,

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:21.760
prisons, health care segregation,

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:23.280
arms sales to the Israeli government,

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:24.720
and many other things

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:27.040
because they recognize that all those forces

01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:29.200
disproportionately hurt women

01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:32.720
and therefore women can be brought together

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:34.480
to protest against them

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:37.600
if given the chance to express our feelings

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:40.160
of hurt and righteous anger.

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:42.320
There's many ways to be involved in a group like that

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:44.160
from actually taking Barton demonstrations

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:45.280
to donating money

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:48.320
which again empowers a broad coalition.

01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:50.960
A broad coalition, a coalition of broads,

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:54.240
dames, dime pieces, chicks, dolls, all standing together.

01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:55.920
Will it work?

01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:00.240
Well, join me at the end of the 21st century

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:02.080
to see humanity's final scores.

01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:04.480
And now our second question.

01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:08.800
Can we reach people stuck in phantasms?

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:11.280
Is there a cure for brainworns?

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:18.800
Well, to be honest,

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:20.880
there's somebody who does a lot of public education.

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:21.920
I really hate to admit this,

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:25.520
but I am not optimistic that education will work.

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:29.040
Butler says that this movement

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:32.000
is not only irrational but anti-rational.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Many of the most prominent people in it

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.080
proudly do not engage

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:38.320
with any of the academic material on gender.

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:41.280
At the end of my research journey,

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:44.080
I realized the reason they don't listen

01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:46.560
is because they feel that listening

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:47.840
is an act of submission.

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:55.280
And I can't help it.

01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:56.400
I think that's really sad.

01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:58.560
I really don't want to come across

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:02.240
as like patronizing or giving people

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:04.320
with mercy that they wouldn't give me,

01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:06.960
but I think it is really sad

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:10.400
when people refuse their own complexity,

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:11.840
when they refuse to become

01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:14.160
the person that they might become

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:15.200
if they just listened.

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:20.560
Indeed, there could be no greater enemy

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:23.920
for philosophy tube than the anti-gender phantasm.

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:27.360
This show is about compassion and reason

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:30.480
and sharing knowledge between equals.

01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:33.440
It's born out of my belief that

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:41.360
thinking and research and words and writing

01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:44.160
that they matter.

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:48.160
And I'm trans.

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:53.840
This is my final boss fight.

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:58.400
Informed public debate becomes impossible

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.320
when some parties refuse to read

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:02.320
the material under dispute.

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:04.320
It is nearly impossible to breach

01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:07.120
this epistemic divide with good arguments

01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:08.560
because of the fear that reading

01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:11.760
will introduce confusion into the reader's mind

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:14.720
or bring her into direct contact with the devil.

01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:17.040
They're skeptical of the academy

01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:19.200
for fear that intellectual debates

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:22.160
may well confuse them about the values they hold.

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:25.920
They're refusal to care much about consistency,

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:28.960
to base their criticisms on a reading of the text,

01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:30.640
their way of snatching phrases

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:32.240
and making them into lightning rods.

01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:36.880
However, are all finally a refusal to think critically.

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:43.920
Some individual people do get better.

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:47.840
When we first come out,

01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:50.560
there's going to be people who do not take it well.

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:56.000
But in time, they see that we are happier

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.360
and for most of them, that's enough.

01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:04.000
I'm scared of changing.

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:06.480
No offence.

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:10.240
Yeah, well, you will change.

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:14.160
But you keep the good bits.

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:21.360
Are you still making philosophy tube in the future?

01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:23.600
What did the audience say?

01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:26.720
They brought them with me.

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:33.600
Oh, hi.

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:36.640
Nice to see you all.

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:40.320
There's more of them.

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:42.320
A lot more.

01:05:58.400 --> 01:05:58.960
I love you.

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:02.640
I love you too.

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:26.400
I'd like to end by telling you my hopes for the future.

01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:29.200
I hope that I will grow old.

01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:32.080
I hope that when I am old,

01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:34.880
I will still be cooking the way that my mom taught me

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:37.520
and that I will have the wisdom of my dad.

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:42.160
I hope that my nieces and my nephew grow up into good

01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:43.200
and happy people.

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:46.640
I hope that I will see younger people

01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:48.240
have opportunities that I didn't.

01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:51.120
And I hope that I won't be too jealous.

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:55.440
I hope that I will be acting and making art

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:57.040
for the rest of my life.

01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:02.640
I hope that this is not the cleverest

01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:05.040
or the most compassionate that I will ever be,

01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:08.240
but that I will continue to change.

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:15.200
Because the only people who don't change are the dead.

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:26.400
Speaking of changes,

01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:31.280
I've been doing philosophy tube for 11 years now.

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:34.400
Some of you have been here that whole time.

01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:35.680
And I don't know if you realize it,

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:39.360
but you have changed my life.

01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:42.560
Off YouTube, I'm a professional actor.

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:45.200
YouTube kind of blew up first,

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:48.000
but it's always been separate from my acting career.

01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:51.280
Until I wrote a play called The Prince,

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:54.960
which a lot of you came to see, so it did really well.

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:57.680
And then I got cast in Baldur's Gate 3.

01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:01.280
And then I got cast in Star Wars.

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:04.800
And then I got cast in something that's even bigger than Star Wars

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:06.160
that I'm not allowed to tell you about yet.

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:11.040
And the engine of all of this has been you.

01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:14.080
I used to think that I would probably have to leave YouTube behind

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:15.760
someday to focus on acting,

01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:20.560
but now I realize that because of you and your lovely enthusiasm

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:22.960
for all of the things that I make and that I'm in,

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:28.560
I now realize we can combine YouTube and acting

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:32.560
into something more powerful than either one can be alone.

01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:36.320
So then I was like, okay, I want to write a short film.

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:37.680
And I did.

01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:40.240
It's called Dracula's Ex-Girlfriend.

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:44.000
It's about two vampire chicks in LA being horrible to each other.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.880
I pitched it to a streaming service called Nebula.

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:51.600
I said, hey, I've got this big audience and we already had success with my play.

01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:53.440
Do you maybe want to do a movie?

01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:54.480
And they said, yes.

01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:58.480
Once again, you have changed my life.

01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:01.120
Do you know how many actors would kill to have a streaming service

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:02.880
pick up their debut film?

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:04.000
I'm going to be in it too.

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:09.040
My co-stars are Morgana Ignis and Brandon Rogers from Hell of a Boss,

01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:11.760
one of the biggest shows in the world.

01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:15.280
And you will be able to see the film when it comes out

01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:19.600
at go.nebula.tv slash dex.

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:24.080
And it gets better because Nebula isn't just another streaming service.

01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:26.640
Imagine that you had a role in a show on Disney Plus.

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:29.200
Say, I don't know, Star Wars the Acolyte?

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:32.240
Well, you do the job and you have a great time.

01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:34.080
And at the end of the day, you go home.

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:36.240
Star Wars belongs to Disney.

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:41.600
But on Nebula, the people who create the thing own the thing.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.600
I wrote Dracula's ex-girlfriend, so I keep the rights.

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:50.480
They're giving the creators more power and even better.

01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:52.480
If you all go and get Disney Plus to watch Star Wars,

01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:53.360
then that's really cool.

01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:56.640
But the creators of the show don't get like a bonus or anything.

01:09:56.640 --> 01:10:00.800
However, if you get Nebula using that link specifically,

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:04.880
then I get a cut and you get a discount.

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:08.000
$2.50 a month with an annual subscription.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.200
So I help you.

01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:10.640
You're helping me.

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:13.040
We are helping each other.

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:14.800
And there's even more.

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:17.760
If you want to see the full scene that we shot for this episode,

01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:21.280
without all the video essay bits in between, that's on Nebula too.

01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:25.120
Every episode of Philosophy Tube goes up there early and uncensored.

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:26.320
Lindsay Ellis is on there.

01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:27.680
Legal Eagle's on there.

01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:29.040
H-Bomber Guy's on there.

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:31.120
They're making a whole bunch of documentaries now.

01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:33.920
They're making a sci-fi movie directed by Jesse Gender

01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:35.040
that I'm going to be in.

01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:36.240
It's called Identities.

01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:37.440
It comes out in June.

01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:40.800
If you get Nebula, you can see all of that.

01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:43.840
We are combining YouTube and acting.

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:46.400
And we are unlocking the power.

01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:49.680
You and I have had a lot of fun over these last 11 years.

01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:53.040
The next step is Dracula's ex-girlfriend.

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:58.560
And after that, wait and see.

01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:24.320
She's the type who will get what she wants, doesn't hide.

01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:31.360
Always hiding the sun and it kills me slowly.

01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:39.920
Seeing her pass me by in the city of dreams.

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:44.480
Wish that I had the power in me.

01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:52.240
But I'm just too madly insecure.

01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:58.480
All the time that I waste and always looking

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:04.240
at strangers thinking there's so much better than me.

01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:09.760
All the time that I wait is they don't make it some changes.

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:12.720
It's crazy.

01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:15.280
Who's that girl?

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:19.920
She walks around like she could rule the world.

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:25.040
She goes for everything that she deserves.

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:29.600
Say what would it take for me to be like her?

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:34.160
I want it out.

01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:38.720
I want it out.

01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:42.160
Because I just want to be somebody.

01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:44.160
Not just anybody.

01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:46.160
Tell me who's that?

01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:47.600
Who's that?

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:48.560
Who's that?

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:53.120
In your eyes, there's a sense of belief.

01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:55.600
I just cry.

01:12:55.600 --> 01:13:02.560
I'm a pretty party and I'm getting nowhere.

01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:14.000
When she comes first, how can I get some confidence with my mind?

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Never wants to be friends.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:26.000
It just keeps comparing me to her.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.480
Who's that girl?

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:33.040
She walks around like she could rule the world.

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:38.240
She goes for everything that she deserves.

01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:42.800
Say what would it take for me to be like her?

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:46.720
I want to know who's that girl.

01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:51.280
She's got a power like we're all here.

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:56.480
I bet she's got to make me wait when it works.

01:13:56.480 --> 01:14:01.040
Say what would it take for me to be like her?

01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:05.600
I want it out.

01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:10.240
I want it out.

01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:13.680
Because I just want to be somebody.

01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:15.680
Not just anybody.

01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:17.680
Tell me who's that?

01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:19.680
Who's that?

01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:23.680
Who's that girl?

01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:27.680
Who's that girl?

01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:31.680
Because I just want to be somebody.

01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:33.680
Not just anybody.

01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:35.680
Tell me who's that?

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:37.680
Who's that?

01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:39.920
Who's that girl?

01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:51.920
You can moonwalk and live your talent.

01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:53.920
Apparently.

01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:57.920
That's it, that's the end of the video.

01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:00.160
I'm just kidding.
