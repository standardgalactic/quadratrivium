0	4080	Judith Butler might be the most misunderstood philosopher in the world,
4080	7280	so I decided to read as much of their work as I could in one month.
7280	11360	Actually, I read it in like four months, but YouTube videos need narrative now.
11360	16160	Butler has been writing for over 40 years about a lot of things, including gender.
16160	19920	If you've ever heard the idea that gender is performative, that's them.
19920	22800	Their work has also been the subject of huge backlash,
22800	27600	like in 2017, protesters in Brazil burned an effigy of Judith Butler.
27680	29840	Philosophy doesn't usually get that spicy.
29840	32560	I must have missed the effigy making class during my degree.
32560	35520	Interestingly, the people with the strongest reactions to Butler
35520	38560	often haven't understood or even read their work,
38560	41600	and now they have a new book about the backlash.
41600	43840	Who's Afraid of Gender?
43840	47360	I've deliberately filmed the bulk of this video on a white void background
47360	48960	with minimal costumes.
48960	51760	Kind of an old-fashioned style on YouTube these days,
51760	55760	but I wanted to get across the idea that as controversial as this stuff might be,
55760	56880	there's nothing hidden.
56880	59360	You're not committing yourself to anything by hearing it.
59360	63120	It's just an invitation to listen and consider a different point of view.
63120	66240	And really, that's a skill we could all do with practicing,
66240	70000	because this philosophy has huge real-world implications.
70000	72240	I was inspired to take this research journey
72240	74800	when I read this article in The Washington Post.
74800	77840	Students from E.C. Glass High School in Lynchburg, Virginia,
77840	80240	applied for a grant from It Gets Better,
80240	82960	a non-profit dedicated to kids' mental health.
82960	84080	And they got it.
84080	87920	They were awarded $10,000 to put a chill-out room in their school,
87920	91520	a space with comfy chairs and relaxed lighting to go if they're stressed.
91520	91920	Nice.
91920	94880	But the school board sent the money back.
94880	96560	They said that if they took it,
96560	101920	students would have to watch pro-LGBTQ videos, which wasn't true.
101920	104480	It Gets Better does focus on helping LGBTQ kids,
104480	106080	but the room would have been open to anyone,
106080	108720	and the grant had no requirements about watching anything.
108720	111200	But the board wouldn't listen.
111200	113920	The board discussed this for longer than they discussed
113920	117920	the literal closure of two entire schools in their district.
117920	119600	And that stunned me.
119600	122480	A school board rejected $10,000 of free money
122480	124960	and talked about something that isn't true for so long.
124960	127040	It impaired their ability to work.
127040	128800	So what happened here?
128800	130320	Why couldn't they listen?
130320	134720	This polarization is exactly what Butler's interested in.
134720	137440	I'll take you through their technical philosophy.
137440	139840	Although really, I wish I could just show you,
139840	143840	because I'm somebody whose mind has definitely changed on these issues.
143920	146080	But it's not like I can just go back in time
146080	148080	and talk to my past self.
160720	161360	Oh my god.
162800	164080	These Maddlings are amazing.
168000	169600	So, you're surprised?
169600	169840	Yeah.
170800	171120	Fair.
172080	174000	But how surprised are you, really?
181200	182240	You look like Mum.
182240	182800	Right?
182800	184080	You sound different.
184960	186400	Seattle Voice Lab.
186400	186880	Look them up.
188240	189920	I can turn it on and off whenever I want.
193360	195520	So in about three years, we have to move flats.
195520	197760	And the internet contract is in your name.
197760	199360	So when I call to cancel it,
199440	200480	they won't talk to me.
200480	202400	And I have to say, hang on a minute.
202400	205680	I'll go get him and do your voice.
205680	206640	Turn the phone.
208480	209280	I'll be Mum and Dad.
209280	209680	Take it.
210320	211360	Really well, actually.
212400	213840	There's this nice moment in about three years
213840	215200	when you and Dad are going to be out.
215200	216320	Actually, I think you're gone by this point.
216320	217040	It's just me and him.
217600	219360	And we bump into small family friends
219360	220560	and they're super awkward about it.
220560	222800	And Dad's just like, whatever, their problem.
222800	224160	He's not embarrassed.
227120	228000	Why would he be embarrassed?
228960	230160	Were you dressed like this?
232640	233680	Address however I want.
235360	236560	Dude, that's the whole point.
237440	240400	The whole thing is so liberating.
240400	242160	Seriously, you are going to love it.
242160	243840	Just the freedom to be.
243840	245600	I don't want to be like you.
248880	249280	Why not?
250880	252320	Let's talk about Fem boys.
253520	255920	I began at the beginning.
255920	257920	Butler's 1988 paper,
257920	260640	Performative Acts and Gender Constitution,
260640	263040	one of the first things they ever wrote.
263040	264880	And right up top, we should acknowledge,
264880	268160	Butler's academic writing can sometimes be pretty difficult.
268160	269120	And that's fair enough.
269680	271520	Gender is a difficult subject.
272320	273840	Mine took me two attempts.
273840	277120	What made it click for me is it reminded me of a friend
277840	280160	who will call F.
281680	285600	F is very cool, clever and funny.
285600	287680	And unpretentious, the kind of person who turns up
287680	289440	to a fancy restaurant wearing a trucker hat.
290240	291920	F is also a Fem boy.
292560	294320	Fem boys take on attributes
294320	296000	that are typically considered feminine,
296000	299040	but they are not themselves women, usually.
299600	302800	Fem boy is also a genre of online content.
302800	304480	F dresses up like a girl
304480	306480	and streams themselves playing video games.
306480	311680	When I first met F, I wondered, is Fem boy a gender?
312560	315840	Well, it's less a thing that you are
315840	319040	and more a thing that you do like a job.
319680	322320	And interestingly, because the Fem boy aesthetic
322320	324800	is so shaped by online content,
324800	328240	to do Fem boy in a way that other people will recognize
328240	330720	requires you to adopt certain behaviors
330720	332400	and stylized practices
332400	335040	whose meaning is not determined by you.
335680	338240	You can't choose what the trends are,
338240	341520	what styles of makeup or dress signal Fem boy.
341840	344080	You've got to learn them and do them
344080	345920	if you want to be seen that way.
345920	348000	And F works pretty hard at that.
348000	349360	If you're very clever,
349360	351920	you'll already have guessed where this is going.
352800	357200	According to Butler, all gender works that way.
358000	360800	In this paper, they say that gender is a thing
360800	365120	we do through repeated, stylized acts.
365120	368480	Not a property, but an embodied event.
369280	372400	Those acts get their meaning from a social world.
372400	376960	So in a way, gender is also a thing that is done to us.
376960	379360	Gender is in no way a stable identity
379360	381920	or locus of agency from which various acts proceed.
382560	386720	Rather, it's an identity tenuously constituted in time,
386720	390640	an identity instituted through a stylized repetition of acts.
391280	394400	Further, gender is instituted through a stylization of the body
394400	396880	and hence must be understood as the mundane way
396880	399280	in which bodily gestures, movements and enactments
399280	402960	of various kinds constitute the illusion of an abiding gendered self.
403520	404720	You're ridiculous.
404720	406240	Says discount Tom Hiddleston.
406240	408240	Your face doesn't look like me anymore.
408240	410720	Did you get plastic surgery on my face?
410720	412320	Well, there's no plastic in me, babes.
412320	413200	I'm all natural.
413200	415120	Artificial surgery makes you natural, does it?
416240	420480	At first glance, Butler's ideas seemed a little strange to me
420480	423920	because we often talk as if gender is an inner truth.
423920	427440	For example, when people change gender and come out,
427440	432480	we're often said to be living authentically or being true to ourselves.
432480	437680	Even the term coming out implies that there was an authentic self before who was hidden.
437680	441520	But according to Butler, there might be no such thing.
442320	448000	It's not that I exist and then I choose to perform gender in ways that you will recognize.
448000	452480	I can't even form a concept of I without using gendered language
452480	456800	and stylized practices whose meaning exists prior to me.
457600	462240	Gender is one of the ways that human subjects come into existence.
462240	468960	The technical term here is subjectification, and that process happens publicly.
469840	474480	Gender creates the illusion of a private self which exists before all of that,
474480	476960	but this is just an illusion.
476960	479840	If a tree falls in the forest and nobody's around to hear it,
480640	482560	it has no pronouns.
482560	488160	Herein lies the distinction between performative and performance,
488160	489360	which are often mixed up.
490160	493120	When people say gender is a performance,
493120	496160	they mean that people exist first without gender,
496160	500240	and then they put on costumes or makeup or wigs the way that an actor does.
500240	502800	But that's not what Butler is saying.
503680	507040	Performative is a technical philosophy term
507040	511440	for when you say something and by saying it, you also do it.
511440	517120	For example, if you say I promise, you say the words and you make a promise.
517120	521840	If a judge says I sentence you, they say it and they do it.
522480	527040	When Butler says that gender is performative, they mean it that way.
527040	534960	You do it and you make it so, and indeed by doing it, you are made so.
534960	537600	And people have made fun of Butler for this idea.
537600	540400	I've seen people say, oh, Judith Butler says,
540400	543120	you can just choose to be any gender you want.
543120	547360	Oh, I men can choose to be women and women can choose to be baboons
547360	549680	and I can choose to be an attack helicopter.
549680	551280	Ha ha, how silly.
551280	553360	But when I actually read their work,
553360	556000	I realized that's not what they're saying at all.
556800	562640	Our very concept of ourselves as gendered subjects requires a social world.
562720	567680	We depend on others for the recognition we need to become gendered subjects.
567680	571600	We can still make some choices where whatever clothes or makeup you like,
572160	577280	but the meaning of those things is not within our soul control.
577280	581520	People have been making jokes like that about Butler for decades,
581520	588560	even though they address this misunderstanding in their first paper, in the first paragraph.
589520	595040	Almost like the people mocking them aren't really listening.
599760	604560	There is no volitional subject behind the mime who decides, as it were,
604560	606000	which gender it will be today.
606640	611280	On the contrary, the very possibility of becoming a viable subject
611280	615040	requires that a certain gender mime be already underway.
615040	617360	I didn't come back here to argue with you, I'm trying to help.
617360	618720	I don't believe it, it's a trick.
619600	620960	You were born in your castle.
620960	622560	Your favourite fruit is Chinese.
622560	624400	Your first crush was named Flossy.
624400	627360	No, no, no, you could have tortured me and got in that information.
627360	627680	What?
627680	630080	Well, I don't know, you could have gotten it out on me somehow in the future.
630080	633680	Just listen to me, we're the same height, we have the same eyes.
633680	635440	Your body's completely different.
635440	637200	Yes, that's the point.
637200	639200	Human bodies can't change that much.
639200	639680	We can!
639680	642400	Even if you are, even if you are, even if you are, even if you are.
642400	644320	Let's talk about Kristen Stewart.
644320	649040	Next on my reading list was Butler's famous 1990 book Gender Trouble.
649040	652640	But it's pretty tough and technical, so we could use a bit of a run-up.
652640	655040	We can actually start with this.
655920	660560	In March 2024, actor Kristen Stewart appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone, looking…
664720	667120	In the interview, Stewart said,
667120	671920	I want to do the gayest f***ing thing you've ever seen in your life.
672800	680480	If I could grow a little mustache, if I could grow a f***ing happy trail and unbutton my pants,
681840	682800	I would.
682800	685600	Later at the Berlin Film Festival, she added,
685600	691200	The existence of a female body thrusting any type of sexuality at you that's not designed for
691200	697440	or desired by exclusively cis straight males is something people are not super comfy with.
697440	699600	And so I am really happy with it.
699600	701280	I had a great time.
701280	705520	A lot of people think that there's a difference between sex and gender.
706240	711680	Sex is supposed to be the physical thing, some combination of genes or genitals or gametes,
711680	715760	or maybe it's something in your brain, but it's there in the world.
715760	721280	And gender is just what we do with it, or at least that's how the story goes.
721280	725200	It might be helpful to know something of the history of that idea.
725840	729360	For millennia, male-dominated societies exploited women
729360	732960	and justified it by claiming that we are naturally inferior.
732960	736480	From Greek and Roman philosophers saying that women can't be educated,
736480	740480	to Victorian doctors saying that we are too emotional to vote, to today.
740480	746880	Some people still say women are by nature not equipped to live as equal members of society.
746880	748720	Oh, she could never lead a nation.
748720	750800	What if she got her period and started a war?
752000	755600	Misogyny has consistently justified itself by appealing to
755680	759520	facts about our bodies that are simply made up.
759520	762800	If you'd like to know more about the history of this practice, then I really recommend
764240	768320	The Once and Future Sex by historian Eleanor Yanagher.
768320	772160	Into this context comes French philosopher Simone de Beauvoir,
772160	778320	whose landmark book The Second Sex comes out in 1949 and opens with this sentence.
778320	781920	One is not born, but rather becomes a woman.
781920	787440	De Beauvoir challenges this history, saying that whilst there are facts about female biology,
788000	794080	male-dominated society also makes a lot of stuff up and claims that the stuff it makes up is facts.
794080	799680	The technical term here is naturalization, making something appear natural.
799680	802080	For example, women are denied the vote?
802080	804560	Well, it's not because we live in an unequal society,
804560	809040	it's because the female brain just can't handle it because of biology.
809040	818240	So, she says, one is born female, but woman is a socially constructed ideal of subordination,
818240	822640	that we are encouraged to embrace and punished for defying.
822640	828960	And then, in the 1980s, along come French philosophers Monique Wittig and Michel Foucault,
828960	834640	who say this sex versus gender distinction is just another layer of control.
835280	842880	De Beauvoir thinks that woman is an oppressive social construct, but female somehow isn't?
844320	849760	Human beings are 99.9% identical. Who does it serve to split hairs about the remaining 0.1%?
850560	855200	Defining one half of the human species in terms of our capacity to carry babies and be fertile
855200	861280	and straight and thereby participate in systems of property and inheritance overwhelmingly controlled
861280	868080	by men? Does that sound like a natural distinction? Or does it sound like a political one?
868080	874080	Wittig actually says that women should reject womanhood entirely by becoming lesbians,
874080	878560	rejecting the patriarchal categories of both woman and female.
878560	884720	Categories which she says only make sense inside the heterosexual matrix.
884800	891840	Do not try and change sex. That's impossible. Instead, only try to realize the truth.
894080	899440	There is no sex. We've been compelled in our bodies and in our minds to correspond
899440	903520	feature by feature with the idea of nature that has been established for us,
903520	908160	distorted to such an extent that our deformed body is what they call natural,
908160	913040	what is supposed to exist as such before oppression, distorted to such an extent
913040	917520	that in the end oppression seems to be a consequence of this nature within ourselves.
918080	923440	By admitting that there is a natural division between women and men, we naturalize history.
923440	928080	Not only do we naturalize history, but also consequently we naturalize the social phenomena
928080	934160	which express our oppression, making change impossible. Lesbian is the only concept I know
934160	940640	of which is beyond the categories of sex, woman and man, because the designated subject, lesbian,
940640	944800	is not a woman, either economically or politically or ideologically.
945520	950080	For what makes a woman is a specific social relation to a man, a relation that we have
950080	955280	previously called servitude, a relation which implies personal and physical obligation as well
955280	960080	as economic obligation, forced residence, domestic corvée, conjugal duties, unlimited production
960080	966480	of children, etc. A relation which lesbians escape by refusing to become or stay heterosexual.
967120	971120	I'm not sure that I personally agree with everything Wittig says, but it's a provocative
971120	977760	thought, worth listening to, and in gender trouble, Butler thinks so too. They say we should
977760	984640	question the idea that sex is a natural category. That might sound very out there, but just listen
984640	990240	for a moment. Once upon a time, people believed that race was a natural category. They wrote
990240	995120	scientific papers about it and measured people's skulls and took blood samples and they believed
995120	1000720	that it was real. Nowadays we know that race is a political grouping that was naturalized,
1000720	1006720	made to look natural, in large part to justify slavery. And we also know that sex was a big
1006720	1013520	part of that. Black women and white women were categorized very differently. So are you certain
1014080	1019440	that the distinction between male and female is as secure as you've been told?
1021520	1022400	Who told you that?
1022640	1026960	Why did they tell you it?
1029040	1032080	And who benefits from you continuing to believe it?
1032080	1033920	You think that's pussy you're eating now?
1033920	1039440	This is the artistic space that Christian Stewart's photo shoot is playing in. The
1039440	1046560	piece and Stewart's comments engage in what Butler calls re-signification, giving a new
1046560	1052800	meaning to something. In this case, Stewart's body. The question it poses is, what if this
1053520	1062720	is also female? What does that tell us about the sense or non-sense of gendered categories?
1062720	1071200	But if sex isn't real, then why did I go through all the trouble of changing mine?
1071600	1075440	It's a blunt question, but it's not an unfair one.
1076320	1083360	So when I finished gender trouble, I also read this, Whipping Girl by Julius Serrano. Serrano
1083360	1089600	is a biologist. She believes in what she calls subconscious sex, something in the brain that
1089600	1094960	expects the body to be a certain way. She thinks this would explain the existence of people like
1094960	1102960	me and also her, whose gender just feels right. It's an interesting idea, and I think it gets
1102960	1110480	to the heart of an intuition a lot of us have to go, look, like physical differences are there.
1110480	1114480	We can see them. Some human beings can get pregnant and others can't. Like,
1115200	1120080	is Butler really saying that all of that isn't real? But then I read the book again,
1120080	1126400	and it turns out that's also a misunderstanding. Butler's not saying that the physical world
1126400	1130720	isn't there or even that it's unknowable. They're just saying that whatever facts
1130720	1138480	there might be about biological sex, we can only learn them and talk about them through gender.
1139200	1145440	To say the sentence, my brain expects my body to be female, is to draw on a particular understanding
1145440	1149040	of the word female. And while we're at it, a particular understanding of the meaning of the
1149040	1156400	words my and body, that get their meaning from a social world. I've seen some more recent philosophers
1156400	1163040	use the term sex slash gender, and even sex slash gender slash race. And now I understand why we
1163040	1168080	can't really think about those things separately. It's not that there's sex, the biological reality,
1168080	1173440	and then there's gender on top of it. It's all gender. It's all gender.
1173920	1179440	Or why it has been. Physical features appear to be in some sense there on the far side of language,
1179440	1184480	unmarked by a social system. It is unclear, however, that these features could be named
1184480	1189680	in a way that would not reproduce the reductive operation of the categories of sex. In other words,
1189680	1196240	sex imposes an artificial unity on an otherwise discontinuous set of attributes. As both discursive
1196240	1203040	and perceptual, sex denotes a historically contingent epistemic regime, a language that forms
1203040	1207920	perception by forcibly shaping the interrelationships through which physical bodies are perceived.
1208640	1213520	The existence and facticity of the material or natural dimensions of the body are not denied,
1213520	1218000	but reconceived as distinct from the process by which the body comes to bear cultural meanings.
1218560	1223600	If gender is the cultural significance that the sexed body assumes, and if that significance
1223600	1227760	is co-determined through various acts in their cultural perception, then it would appear that
1227760	1233520	from within the terms of culture, it is not possible for no sex as distinct from gender.
1257760	1262800	A woman is a human being who belongs to the sex class that produces large gametes.
1265280	1269840	May I suggest also posting interesting and positive content on other matters?
1269840	1273920	I live in England, where a lot of people are talking about sex at the moment.
1274800	1282640	Some say that sex is a fixed point that cannot be changed or signified or questioned,
1282640	1287440	whereas gender is just a nebulous feeling or a contested belief.
1288560	1290960	I thought all that feminist philosophy was pretty interesting,
1291920	1297920	but it seems some people don't want to listen.
1313040	1317600	What if they walk in now and say you made a mistake?
1317600	1319200	Then I made the mistake you wanted to make.
1319200	1321040	Better the devil you know than the devil you don't.
1321760	1323600	The gates of hell are locked from the inside.
1323600	1325360	What makes me suspicious, right?
1325360	1328560	Is you're coming in here going, oh, everything's wonderful, right?
1328560	1331520	Trying to convince me, but you don't mention any downsides.
1331520	1332800	Of course there's downsides.
1332800	1333360	Well go on then.
1335840	1336800	Street harassment?
1339280	1340880	Men are going to shout at you in the street.
1341840	1344480	Men push into you and interrupt you.
1344480	1345280	And?
1346080	1349760	And it's scary sometimes being a woman.
1353840	1355440	There's this girl called Sarah Everard.
1356720	1360560	She's going to get murdered in 2021 by a police officer.
1361360	1362000	It's a big thing.
1362000	1362880	It's on all the news.
1364000	1365520	And I have a vigil for her in London.
1365520	1366960	Women come from all over the country.
1367760	1371280	And the police beat and arrest the women at the vigil.
1373040	1375760	And you're going to see that and you're going to feel scared because it's like,
1377120	1379760	wow, this is how they treat us.
1381360	1382160	Were you there?
1385440	1385940	No.
1388320	1390960	I didn't feel entitled to.
1392320	1392820	Good.
1394000	1395840	The body we have is threatening.
1396160	1400240	It wouldn't be appropriate for us to be out and about violence against women.
1400240	1401200	We're not violent.
1402560	1407040	I mean, we're like tall, but so are giraffes.
1408720	1409680	Bodies are just bodies.
1412240	1413280	I wish I had been there.
1415120	1416400	We need all the allies we can get.
1418240	1422880	I tell you this, you're going to have to go through so much bullshit just to get health care.
1422880	1426080	And all of that comes from this place of being like, oh,
1426080	1428000	everybody needs to fit a strict definition.
1428000	1429360	Everyone has to be in a little box.
1431360	1433360	I'll do what I want and I'll help who I can.
1435600	1437280	Let's talk about feminism.
1437280	1439760	If there is no natural category of sex,
1440480	1442480	then how can we argue for women's rights?
1444160	1445840	That's a question some people are asking.
1445840	1447520	And I'll admit I was curious.
1447520	1450720	I've seen some say that Butler is erasing women
1450720	1454400	and that in order to protect us from things like discrimination and assault,
1454400	1461120	the law needs a strict definition of women grounded in facts about biological sex.
1461120	1465120	Thing is, I happen to know just off my own bat that that's actually incorrect.
1465120	1470800	For example, suppose an employer denies a job to a candidate named Hillary because they think,
1470800	1475920	oh, women, women be shopping, women are unreliable employees, application denied.
1475920	1479760	Only it turns out Hillary is Hillary with one L. The candidate is a man.
1480480	1483680	In that case, the employer can still be guilty of sexual discrimination,
1483680	1487760	even though their definition of what a woman is, is false and didn't even apply.
1488320	1491360	The same principle also goes in crimes like assault.
1491360	1494880	If a straight person gets attacked coming out of a gay club,
1494880	1498080	that can still be a homophobic hate crime if the suspect
1498080	1502000	believes that they're gay and attacks them for that reason.
1502000	1505120	What matters in law is the suspect's actions and motivations,
1505120	1507600	not whether the victim meets a particular definition.
1507600	1510400	Even though this is a matter of settled law,
1511040	1516160	some people still insist that a strict definition is required,
1517040	1520880	almost like those people aren't listening.
1523600	1529040	But anyway, wouldn't it still be useful to have some definition of women,
1529040	1532240	even if we all know it's kind of vague and loose?
1532240	1535520	Could it be useful as a political standard to rally around?
1535520	1540640	I read Butler's 1991 paper, Imitation and Gender Subordination,
1540640	1543200	which is partly about this definition question.
1543840	1546960	They say that defining womanhood has been,
1546960	1550560	and still is, a key strategy of patriarchy.
1550560	1552960	And that's what de Beauvoir was writing about in the 40s.
1553520	1559040	Trying to set an exact definition is always going to be an exclusionary project,
1559040	1563440	whereas a certain amount of grey area would be more inclusive.
1563440	1567520	Indeed, they say that any category like gay, lesbian, trans,
1568400	1571280	femboy, imposes limits.
1571280	1574720	And trying to make everybody fit one specific box
1574720	1578400	as if they must have some inner self that corresponds to one of them
1578960	1580400	is just a bad idea.
1580400	1583040	And I understood where Butler was coming from there.
1583680	1588560	In Britain, trans people are often expected to tell doctors
1588560	1590800	a certain story about our lives.
1590880	1593760	We're supposed to say, oh, ever since I was a child,
1593760	1595920	I called myself Wendy and wore my mother's dresses,
1595920	1597840	and if your life doesn't fit that narrative,
1598480	1600160	it can be very hard to get medical care.
1601120	1606160	The concept of an authentic inner self that needs to be discovered
1606160	1610400	and verified and checked and meet somebody else's definition
1611040	1612800	is used against a fact.
1612800	1617120	Identity categories tend to be instruments of regulatory regimes,
1617200	1621120	whether as the normalizing categories of oppressive structures
1621120	1626400	or as the rallying points for a liberatory contestation of that very oppression.
1626400	1630320	That is not to say that I will not appear at political occasions
1630320	1632080	under the sign of lesbian,
1632080	1635280	but that I would like to have it permanently unclear
1635280	1638000	what precisely that sign signifies.
1638000	1641760	Which version of lesbian or gay ought to be rendered visible
1641760	1646160	and which internal exclusions will that rendering visible institute?
1646160	1650000	Can the visibility of identity suffice as a political strategy?
1650000	1654160	Or can it only be the starting point for a strategic intervention
1654160	1657040	which calls for a transformation of policy?
1657040	1660400	Is it not a sign of despair over public politics
1660400	1663120	when identity becomes its own policy,
1663120	1666560	bringing with it those who would police it from various sides?
1667120	1668240	You know what else to tell you, man?
1669280	1672240	Change is difficult, but it is possible.
1673120	1674480	This is going to f**k up our career.
1675440	1676320	On the contrary.
1677280	1678640	It's going to f**k up our love life.
1680400	1681280	On the contrary.
1682400	1686000	Well look, as far as anyone knows right now,
1686640	1689840	I'm a cis-het white guy, right?
1689840	1691360	Like I'm top of the pile.
1691920	1694320	Surely it would be easier to not change.
1694320	1696160	Oh yeah, way easier.
1697360	1699360	If you want to be depressed every day of your life
1699360	1700960	and kill yourself at 35.
1700960	1701760	You know what I mean?
1702560	1705360	Politically things aren't great in my time.
1705920	1708320	I assume in the future they do not vastly improve.
1709040	1711520	Let's talk about 9-11 and dicks.
1712080	1715760	Oh this is where things get silly and then they get very not silly.
1715760	1719200	A penis is an organ of the human body.
1719200	1722080	It has nerves and blood vessels and skin and so on.
1722080	1727040	Its primary function is to allow women who have one to pee standing up
1727040	1730080	if the toilet of the train carriage that you're in is really gross.
1732480	1733920	And it also does some other stuff.
1733920	1735520	Remember what we said earlier though?
1735520	1737760	It's not that there's the physical organ
1737760	1741520	and then a bunch of other social constructee stuff on top.
1741520	1744480	According to Butler, we can only know the body
1744480	1747760	through the social world of symbolic meanings.
1747760	1752000	So that particular organ often means power,
1752000	1755600	strength, domination, particularly when used for penetration,
1755600	1757920	and the threat of male violence.
1758640	1762000	That bundle of cultural and symbolic meanings
1762000	1764640	is what philosophers call the phallus.
1764640	1766400	Can a woman have a penis?
1766400	1769200	This question was a fad in British media a year or two ago.
1769200	1772240	Journalists kept ambushing politicians with it and watching them struggle.
1772240	1773600	But really the answer is quite simple.
1774160	1778320	In Britain, you can change your legal sex without surgery.
1778320	1782560	Because international human rights law recognizes it's probably morally wrong
1782560	1785200	to make a certain group of people undergo expensive, difficult,
1785200	1787280	potentially risky invasive medical procedures
1787280	1790480	that they may not want in order to do things like get married.
1790480	1793200	So if you are assigned male at birth,
1793200	1795360	you can change your legal sex in Britain
1795360	1797440	and become a woman without surgery.
1798000	1801840	It's not an easy process, but surgery isn't mandatory.
1802960	1805200	If you like your dick, you can keep it.
1805200	1807200	Beyond the legal situation though,
1807200	1810560	if a person assigned male takes feminizing hormones,
1810560	1813360	then their body will change and that includes their genitals,
1813360	1815200	which can change a lot more than you might think.
1815760	1818560	In some cases, it essentially becomes a large clitoris
1818560	1820800	incapable of erection or penetration.
1820800	1824400	And whether you want to call that a female penis or a feminine penis
1824400	1826800	or whether you think there's not much distinction there,
1826800	1830000	legally and medically, the facts are in.
1830000	1831120	Can a woman have a penis?
1831840	1832560	Yeah.
1832560	1837520	And yet, people who haven't experienced all that for themselves
1838160	1841760	often don't listen to those who have.
1841760	1845040	Maybe you were giggling when I told you all of that stuff.
1845600	1848480	The idea of a female penis is so unimaginable
1848480	1850720	that it's like a punchline, right?
1851520	1853280	Despite the fact that it is just a normal thing
1853280	1854080	that some people have.
1855040	1857680	It appears funny and unexpected.
1858240	1862240	The idea of resignifying that, using it differently,
1862240	1865680	but not wrongly, not powerful, not for penetration,
1865680	1869680	not even male, appears to be almost a contradiction
1870640	1874720	because that bundle of cultural and symbolic meanings
1874720	1879040	has been naturalized, made to seem natural.
1880160	1881760	And this is a very common mistake.
1882960	1886080	We might even call it a fallacy.
1887200	1893200	All of this is deeply funny until the second it affects government policy.
1894800	1898080	In February 2023, British Justice Secretary Dominic Robb
1898160	1901840	announced that from now on, women who have male genitalia
1901840	1904800	who are arrested will be sent to a men's prison,
1904800	1906400	regardless of what we look like,
1906400	1908960	regardless of whether we have legally changed sex
1908960	1911680	and regardless of what we are charged with.
1911680	1915040	If, for example, I was arrested at a protest,
1915040	1917120	if I was wrongfully arrested for something,
1917680	1919360	I would be sent to a men's prison.
1920320	1922720	And I'm sure you can imagine, although you may not want to,
1923760	1924880	how that might go.
1924880	1927920	There isn't really any good kind of prison,
1928560	1932880	but this policy makes prison worse for a certain section of the population
1932880	1934320	because of the way that we are born.
1934320	1937920	And in that regard, it's ethically unusual.
1937920	1940000	It's normally a principle of justice
1940000	1942640	that similar crimes should carry similar sentences,
1942640	1944560	but in my home country,
1944560	1947920	the same crime might carry a much harsher prison sentence
1947920	1949040	if you're a trans woman.
1949760	1952320	This discrimination is justified by politicians
1952320	1956400	by appealing to the supposed threat that penises carry.
1956400	1960160	But remember, it's regardless of our crime
1960720	1963280	or what our particular bodies are capable of.
1964080	1966080	And that's quite philosophically interesting.
1966080	1967680	They say that we are a threat,
1968560	1973840	but they are not listening to any actual facts about us.
1973840	1975840	Since that 2023 announcement,
1975840	1978320	I'd been trying to understand and listen
1978320	1980160	to the justice secretary's perspective
1980800	1982080	and work my way through the fear.
1982720	1986240	So the next item on my reading list was Butler's 2003 volume
1986240	1987600	Precarious Life.
1988320	1992000	They write about 9-11 and the war on terror.
1992000	1995360	In particular, the people who were detained indefinitely
1995360	1997840	in Guantanamo Bay by the U.S. government.
1998400	2000240	Terror suspects.
2000240	2002160	And suspects is a key word there,
2002160	2004960	because many of those imprisoned were never given a trial.
2004960	2007200	Some of them were never even charged.
2008000	2010560	The government said those people had to be imprisoned
2010560	2011760	because they were dangerous,
2012480	2017600	but not the kind of danger that they could prove in a trial.
2018160	2020400	The danger that these prisoners are said to pose
2020400	2023040	is unlike dangers that might be substantiated
2023040	2025680	in a court of law and redressed through punishment.
2025680	2030000	Establishing dangerousness is not the same as establishing guilt.
2030640	2034000	A certain level of dangerousness takes a human being
2034000	2035920	outside the bounds of law
2035920	2039600	and even outside the bounds of the military tribunal itself
2039600	2042240	makes that human into the state's possession,
2042800	2044080	infinitely detainable.
2044800	2050080	What counts as dangerous is what is deemed dangerous by the state,
2050080	2054560	so that, once again, the state posits what is dangerous
2054560	2057200	and in so doing establishes the conditions
2057200	2059760	for its own preemption and usurpation of the law.
2060320	2062560	If a person is deemed dangerous,
2063360	2066640	then it is no longer a matter of deciding whether criminal acts occurred.
2067200	2072080	Indeed, deeming someone dangerous is an unsubstantiated judgment
2072080	2075520	that in these cases works to preempt determinations
2075520	2077440	for which evidence is required.
2078000	2081040	If you're very clever, you'll already have realised
2081040	2084160	that when governments call people dangerous in this way,
2084800	2087040	they're using performative speech.
2087920	2090320	They say it, and they make it so.
2090320	2094400	But what's happening here isn't subjectification,
2095200	2100000	it's abjectification, creating non-subjects,
2100000	2102800	non-people who exist outside the law
2102800	2105440	and who can therefore be treated any way the government likes.
2105440	2108000	We don't need trials and evidence for them
2108000	2109360	because they're the bad guys.
2110160	2112560	If they have their rights violated or they die,
2112560	2114240	well, you shouldn't care about that
2114240	2117760	because they were never really alive in a way that mattered.
2117760	2120720	In fact, if you do care about what happens to them,
2120720	2121840	then that's suspicious.
2123200	2128240	You're not going to sympathise with the bad guys, are you?
2128240	2131520	If you've been watching the news lately, you might be wondering,
2132080	2134800	the people of Gaza keep being killed,
2134800	2137680	but Western governments aren't listening.
2138240	2141360	Is that maybe an example of abjectification?
2141360	2144480	And according to Butler, the answer is yes.
2144480	2147040	They are a longtime supporter of Palestinian rights
2147040	2150320	and have often used their position as a public Jewish academic
2150320	2153120	to call on the Israeli government to meet their obligations
2153120	2155120	under international human rights law.
2155120	2158800	Butler says abjectification is a tool of government
2158800	2161920	in the 21st century that we need to watch out for.
2162560	2165440	When the powers that be say a certain group of people
2165440	2167360	are inherently dangerous,
2167360	2170480	whether they're Muslims or Palestinians or trans people,
2170480	2174000	that's them trying to use performative speech
2174000	2177680	to make that group of people impossible to listen to.
2178320	2181840	We become not subjects, but abjects.
2182560	2185760	A problem to be managed against our will
2185760	2190720	in the name of a public good that does not recognise us as part of the public.
2191600	2194240	And I'm not drawing a moral equivalence between those three groups,
2194240	2196640	I'm just highlighting this technique of government,
2196640	2198000	making you aware of it,
2198000	2200320	because you never know when the powers that be
2200320	2203040	might decide to use it on you.
2203520	2205600	Yeah, you're right about that.
2207200	2208800	Politics in the future gets weird.
2210400	2211360	How do you mean weird?
2215520	2217120	Let's talk about JK Rowling.
2226880	2229920	We come at last to Butler's new book,
2230880	2234240	Who's Afraid of Gender.
2234880	2238560	In recent years, scholars have been studying the rise
2238560	2241440	of the global anti-gender movement,
2242080	2245760	a network of people including far-right political actors,
2245760	2247200	religious fundamentalists,
2247920	2249920	and a lot of people who are neither.
2250880	2254880	Sometimes it's a literal network of politicians and activists
2254880	2256720	working together behind the scenes,
2256720	2259360	but sometimes it's more of a loose association.
2260080	2262960	They oppose women's rights, especially abortion,
2262960	2267520	LGBTQ rights, and they strongly oppose trans people.
2267520	2271200	There is a part of the movement that emerged from radical feminism,
2271200	2272960	and that part tends to get a lot of attention,
2272960	2274560	especially here on YouTube.
2274560	2277440	Here's three great videos if you're interested,
2277440	2279680	but the movement as a whole is mainly men
2279680	2283120	and supports policies that would harm the vast majority of women.
2283680	2286000	Women play an important role in selling it
2286000	2287760	and helping it appear benign
2287760	2290880	because protecting women is always good PR,
2291440	2293440	but they aren't the core.
2293440	2297200	The core is the fight against gender ideology,
2298000	2301360	but there's not much agreement on what that actually means.
2302160	2304640	In Eastern Europe, they say that gender ideology
2304640	2307280	is spread by the UN and the EU,
2307280	2310480	but in Italy, they say it's spread by African migrants.
2311200	2314000	In Latin America, gender ideology means feminism,
2314000	2316480	but in the UK, they say it's against feminism.
2316560	2318080	In Florida, they say it's gay.
2318080	2320000	In the UK, they say it's homophobic.
2320000	2323200	They say that gender ideology is the new conversion therapy,
2323200	2327680	but some anti-gender organisations are in favour of conversion therapy.
2327680	2330240	Gender ideology is spread by woke students
2330240	2332320	with blue hair and safe spaces,
2332320	2335600	but it's also being pushed on innocent students by wicked professors.
2335600	2338720	Children must not be indoctrinated into gender ideology,
2338720	2341520	and so the government must make sure children believe
2341520	2343600	the things it says about gender,
2343600	2346240	but all of this is deeply confusing.
2347120	2350480	The Oxford English Dictionary defines gender ideology as...
2354560	2357760	Although gender ideology is a vague term,
2357760	2361200	there are recurring themes in how it is used.
2361840	2364560	One such theme is the idea that gender
2364560	2369840	is in some way unnatural or artificial or fake,
2369840	2376240	a contested belief, unlike biological sex and family values
2376320	2379600	which definitely are natural.
2380160	2384640	Another theme is that gender ideologues, whoever they are,
2384640	2387920	are powerful, commanding your obedience,
2387920	2392560	but also very sneaky, capturing institutions behind the scenes.
2392560	2394080	And the sneakiness is important,
2394080	2397040	because it allows the movement to claim gender ideologues
2397040	2399120	or doing all sorts of nefarious things
2399120	2400960	that they have no evidence for,
2400960	2402400	but the reason they have no evidence
2402400	2404080	is because they're so gosh darn sneaky.
2404880	2408480	Self-victimization plays a huge role here.
2408480	2409760	Another reason there's no evidence
2409760	2412480	is because ordinary people are being bullied
2412480	2415120	into silence by the woke genderists.
2415840	2419040	Sometimes this verges into outright conspiracy theory.
2419040	2420960	There are people in my country,
2420960	2423760	people with serious political and media careers,
2423760	2426720	who've claimed that our civil service and healthcare
2426720	2430160	are secretly being run by the trans deep state,
2430160	2433360	which frankly, I wish that were true.
2434000	2436800	The final theme is the danger
2436800	2439920	that gender ideology apparently poses.
2439920	2444400	Whatever it is, it's a threat to women who are erased
2444400	2447040	and to men who are made weak and helpless,
2447040	2449520	to families and to children in particular
2449520	2452080	who are confused or preyed upon.
2452080	2453280	It's a threat to the nation,
2453280	2456080	because you see gender makes us weak to communism,
2456080	2458240	or capitalism, or Vladimir Putin,
2458240	2461040	or Western influence, or Islamic migrants.
2461040	2463840	It's a threat to the existence of humanity
2463840	2467120	and the authority of God himself.
2467120	2469200	The Vatican has actually claimed that.
2469200	2470560	No exaggeration.
2470560	2475680	Pope Francis compared gender ideology to nuclear weapons.
2475680	2479120	It kind of just means the opposite of how things should be,
2480000	2484240	and the way they should be is whatever you personally want.
2485040	2487280	And that's a very effective strategy,
2487280	2489040	because it allows people who previously
2489040	2492000	might not have associated to stand together.
2492000	2494400	The movement features conservative Catholics,
2494400	2497920	men's rights activists, neo-Nazis, new age types,
2497920	2500880	centrists, liberals, and even some feminists.
2500880	2503120	And it's good at radicalizing them too.
2503760	2506400	Gender ideology seems like such a big threat.
2506400	2509280	It can't be stopped by traditional means.
2509280	2511200	We have to get tough.
2511760	2514960	Much of the blame for starting the anti-gender movement
2514960	2517760	belongs, I'm afraid, to Catholics.
2518320	2520240	Since the least the 1980s,
2520240	2523200	conservative Catholics, both within and without the church,
2523200	2526800	have said that gender ideology threatens the family and God.
2527360	2530400	They use this claim as justification for their extreme
2530400	2533680	authoritarian positions on abortion and queerness,
2533680	2535040	among other things.
2535040	2538640	It was Catholics who first started the conspiracy theory
2538640	2543760	that the UN are secretly pushing an anti-Christian gender agenda.
2543840	2547360	The Catholic Church has also claimed several times
2547360	2549760	in writing, without evidence,
2549760	2553360	that gender ideology leads to the abuse of children.
2554960	2559360	An IMAX level act of projection that might honestly be funny
2559360	2561680	if it weren't so insulting to the intelligence
2561680	2564320	of every human being on planet Earth.
2564320	2568080	Religion still plays a big role in driving anti-gender sentiment,
2568080	2570960	especially in the Americas and Eastern Europe.
2571040	2573680	In Britain, our version is a little more secular,
2573680	2575600	but that's not the case everywhere.
2575600	2578240	It's just, we don't go in for Catholicism
2578240	2579200	as much as we used to.
2581360	2585360	But it would be unfair to lay the blame on all Catholics.
2585360	2587520	Evangelicals are getting involved too,
2587520	2590960	and indeed, some ordinary Catholics might be getting scarred.
2594560	2596720	I have to be careful what I say here.
2596720	2600160	I can tell you that religion also plays a role
2600160	2602160	in how the movement is funded.
2602800	2606000	The Piotr Skarga Association, a Polish group
2606000	2608880	who oppose abortion and LGBTQ rights,
2608880	2612160	have raised millions of euros selling rosaries
2612160	2615600	and pictures of saints to Catholics around the world
2615600	2616720	via mail order.
2617440	2621360	And legally, I can't say that's a scam.
2622480	2626000	Maybe everyone who gives them money knows what they use it for.
2626000	2627520	Maybe when a little French grandma
2627520	2630400	in Toulouse buys a calendar with the Virgin Mary on it,
2630400	2632800	she knows full well that her money is going
2632800	2634880	to an extreme right-wing organization in Poland
2634880	2636960	who are going to send some of it to anti-abortion groups
2636960	2639360	in Brazil and spend the rest on luxury properties.
2640800	2642640	Grandma probably did her research.
2643680	2647120	And she'd have to, because their adverts don't mention it,
2647120	2648880	and Piotr Skarga's financial documents
2648880	2650800	were hidden from the public until journalists
2650800	2652640	broke this story in 2020.
2652640	2654880	Speaking of Catholic crimes, though,
2654880	2658400	the narrative is that gender ideology is being pushed
2658400	2661200	on the good people of the world by shadowy elites
2661200	2662480	who are pulling the strings.
2663120	2665280	And at this point in my reading, I was thinking,
2665280	2667280	well, that sounds a lot like anti-Semitism.
2667840	2670240	And yes, there are some parts of the movement
2670240	2672640	that are explicitly anti-Semitic.
2672640	2676240	For example, neo-Nazis have criticized Judith Butler
2676240	2679600	for being a Jewish lesbian who invented gender
2679600	2681120	to weaken the West.
2681120	2682880	But then I read this.
2683760	2686080	Anti-gender politics in the populist moment
2686080	2689280	by Polish scholars Agnieszka Graf and Albert Kolszuk.
2689280	2693760	They say not all anti-genderists are secretly anti-Semitic.
2693760	2696240	The reason they can look similar
2696240	2698640	is because they do similar things.
2699520	2703360	Objectify, make a certain group of people
2703360	2705280	impossible to listen to.
2705840	2709840	Though Jews are almost never mentioned in a text on gender ideology,
2709920	2712560	genderists and especially sexual minorities
2712560	2715840	are consistently Judaized in anti-gender discourse.
2715840	2718640	That is, described in a language strongly reminiscent
2718640	2721040	of conspiratorial anti-Semitism.
2721040	2724720	The link becomes most obvious when Soros and Butler are mentioned,
2724720	2727360	or when the term cultural Marxism,
2727360	2730240	notorious for its anti-Semitic subtext, is employed.
2730800	2732880	Like Jews and anti-Semitic attacks,
2732880	2736160	sexual minorities are presented as engaged in a secretive plot.
2736720	2740160	They are scheming, devious and powerful.
2740160	2743680	To this end, the term homosexual lobby is often used
2743680	2747200	and the link between homosexuality and cosmopolitanism
2747200	2749600	or rootlessness is persistently made.
2750560	2755200	Furthermore, LGBT activists are routinely accused of sacrilege.
2755200	2758880	Their very presence is said to contaminate sacred events and spaces,
2758880	2761040	while the rainbow flag is seen as offensive
2761040	2764240	to religious sensibilities and patriotic feelings.
2764240	2767920	Finally, like Jews and pre-World War II Eastern Europe,
2767920	2770560	gays are blamed for provoking violent attacks
2770560	2772640	by making themselves too conspicuous.
2773760	2775520	We're in the eye of the storm a lot.
2776560	2780960	I mean queer people generally, but sometimes us specifically.
2783280	2785600	Sometimes it feels like being under a big microscope.
2789360	2792160	Do you remember when we were studying theology at university?
2793040	2794160	Yeah, just about.
2796160	2799440	We had this one lecturer who taught us about Genesis.
2800800	2805040	Remember, he said, you are created.
2806160	2807520	You are a creature.
2807520	2809200	Yeah, I do remember that.
2809200	2810960	I didn't like that word creature.
2812720	2814960	Yeah, we belong to us.
2816080	2817680	We decide what we do.
2818240	2822240	Well, if it God does exist, it seems you've got notes.
2825440	2827600	That's all very interesting,
2827600	2833600	but it doesn't explain why the anti-gender movement just doesn't listen.
2833600	2836400	Remember back at the start when we learned about the school board
2836400	2839680	who turned down $10,000 of free money?
2839680	2842320	Remember how the same misunderstandings of Butler's work
2842320	2844000	have circulated for decades?
2844000	2846400	Remember the insistence that the law was made
2847120	2849200	that the law must have a strict definition of women,
2849200	2850880	even though we know that's not true?
2850880	2852880	Remember all those unevidence conspiracies
2852880	2856720	about the trans deep state and secret UN plots?
2856720	2860480	There's something else too that's very interesting.
2861280	2865120	The language that the anti-gender movement uses is very
2866000	2872720	actioning, threat, infiltration, danger, bullying, silencing, censorship,
2872720	2874560	a comparison to nuclear weapons.
2875200	2876560	It's not just that they're not listening.
2877280	2878800	When they're invited to listen,
2879520	2882080	it seems like that makes them feel as if they're under attack.
2883040	2884720	And Butler has an explanation for this.
2885600	2890320	They say that these people are caught in a phantasm.
2891040	2894240	Phantasm is a technical philosophy term
2894240	2897760	for a particular way of misinterpreting the world
2897760	2900560	by projecting your feelings onto it.
2901280	2904400	Philosopher Michael Nass says that it's a prism
2904400	2908080	that refracts an as-if into an as-so.
2908880	2912000	For example, the presence of a trans person
2912000	2913920	with a penis in a public bathroom
2913920	2918000	makes me feel as if I am under attack becomes...
2921360	2923200	I am under attack.
2923920	2928400	People use phantasms to avoid cognitive dissonance
2928400	2930160	in the face of anxiety.
2930640	2933360	For example, literature professor Darren Tenev
2933360	2936000	says we use them to help us confront death.
2936880	2938720	Normally, we don't want to think about our own deaths.
2938720	2940080	It makes us anxious.
2940080	2942560	So when we picture our own funerals
2942560	2945760	and what we would want to happen to our remains,
2945760	2947680	we imagine ourselves as being gone,
2948320	2950320	but also kind of still around.
2950320	2953360	Like, oh, I'd love to be buried somewhere that has a nice view.
2955040	2956160	Well, why?
2956160	2958400	You're not going to be there to enjoy it by definition.
2958400	2959760	That's a contradictory dream.
2960720	2963840	But the phantasm contains that contradiction
2964400	2966960	and soothes our anxiety.
2966960	2969600	It is as if I will still be there.
2972720	2974640	I will still be there.
2975360	2977360	What is characteristic of phantasms
2977360	2978800	is that they are placed
2978800	2981520	and place what could be called the subject of phantasm
2982160	2984480	on both sides of a border,
2984480	2987040	a boundary, a limit, a frontier.
2987040	2989440	When there is a border, a limitation,
2990000	2993040	the phantasm lets one on the other side
2993040	2995600	and not only provides a contraband access
2995600	2996560	through the border,
2996560	2999840	but also keeps one on both sides at the same time.
2999840	3002800	There is no logic of the phantasm.
3002800	3004560	The phantasm is phantasm
3004560	3008160	because it allows one to stand on both sides of a border,
3008160	3009280	for example,
3009280	3012160	allowing one to imagine one's own corpse
3012160	3013760	while still being alive.
3014320	3016960	Like he says, there's no logic to this.
3017520	3020960	It's an exercise in trying to not make sense
3020960	3022800	because you can't handle the conclusions
3022800	3024240	that you would reach if you did.
3024880	3026880	That's why people caught in a phantasm
3026880	3028320	will throw out all kinds of claims
3028320	3030720	that it doesn't really seem like they've thought through
3030720	3032400	or have any evidence for
3032400	3033840	and when questioned on it,
3033840	3035600	they'll say you're attacking me
3035600	3038320	because they're trying really hard
3038320	3041520	to not think something.
3041520	3043520	But what exactly?
3043520	3044800	What is the thing
3044800	3046960	that the anti-gender movement doesn't want to think?
3048880	3051680	Well, it'll probably be different
3051680	3052880	for different individuals.
3053920	3056880	J.K. Rowling has been massively radicalized
3056880	3058800	into the movement in the last few years.
3058800	3060400	She's made a lot of very weird
3060400	3062320	and false claims about trans people
3062320	3064720	and gotten very aggressive when challenged.
3065520	3067840	People have speculated about her trauma,
3067840	3068800	maybe causing that,
3068800	3071040	but as a woman who's also survived
3071040	3072000	an abusive relationship,
3072800	3074160	that kind of public speculation
3074160	3076240	has always felt a little bit gross to me.
3077120	3079840	I don't want to do armchair psychology on anyone,
3079840	3081600	even though I'm sure plenty of people
3081600	3082720	would love to do some on me.
3083600	3086320	It's just not the philosophy cheap way.
3086320	3089200	So maybe we can ask a more general version
3089200	3090400	of this same question.
3091120	3093520	Why are phantasms catching on?
3094160	3095440	And not just about this topic,
3095440	3096960	but all sorts of things.
3096960	3098080	On the previous episode,
3098080	3101040	we talked about 15-minute city conspiracy theories
3101040	3103040	and there's QAnon and conspiracies
3103040	3104480	about the royal family.
3104480	3106560	Sometimes the way that Zionists talk about
3106560	3108880	Palestinians has a touch of the phantasma about it,
3108880	3111280	as some Jewish scholars have noted.
3111280	3113440	This is a really big issue
3113440	3115040	and it would be great if we could sort
3115040	3116400	the whole gender thing out
3116400	3119280	because we've got a lot of real problems to deal with.
3119280	3121840	We don't have time to be fighting imaginary ones.
3124640	3128640	Oh, Graf and Korolchuk say
3129280	3131680	there really are a lot of problems in the world.
3132400	3134160	And a lot of them are systemic.
3134880	3136560	A lot of women really are devalued.
3136560	3138080	A lot of children really are living
3138080	3140800	in an increasingly dangerous and warming world.
3140800	3143120	A lot of people really do rely on their families
3143120	3145040	to protect them from big institutions
3145040	3146240	and economic forces
3146240	3148400	that really will trample every tradition
3148400	3151600	and really do dissolve everything into money.
3151600	3154480	According to them, the anti-gender phantasm
3154480	3158160	is an attempt to criticize the effects of capitalism
3158960	3162160	without naming capitalism as the problem.
3163040	3165360	People see the bad results of the system that we have,
3166160	3168160	but they're invested in those same systems
3168720	3171360	and so the solutions become unthinkable.
3171920	3173600	Their criticisms have to be expressed
3173600	3176800	as a kind of moral criticism.
3178080	3181200	Anti-genderism is the socialism of fools
3182160	3183680	and the feminism of fools
3184720	3187280	and the anti-colonialism of fools.
3187280	3189280	The anti-gender movement is so effective
3189280	3190480	in attracting mass support
3190480	3192400	because it is structured and legitimized
3192400	3195680	as a conservative response to the excesses of neoliberalism.
3196560	3198000	A crucial source of anxiety
3198000	3201280	is the rampant individualism of contemporary culture,
3201280	3202560	the erosion of community
3202560	3204480	and growing instability of everyday life.
3205440	3206880	Opponents of gender ideology
3206880	3209440	attribute these trends to the influence of feminism
3209440	3210640	and the sexual revolution.
3211360	3213200	Anti-genderism conflates gender
3213200	3215040	with those aspects of capitalism
3215040	3216400	that are most frustrating
3216400	3218800	to members of the working and lower middle class,
3218800	3220960	especially to parents and would-be parents,
3220960	3222880	precarity and the crisis of care
3222880	3225120	resulting from unequal distribution of wealth.
3225920	3228640	Instead of naming the problem in economic terms
3228640	3231120	as injustice and exploitation,
3231120	3234240	anti-genderism presents the world of capitalism's winners
3234240	3237120	as degenerate and morally corrupt.
3237120	3240080	And here's where we tie it all together
3240720	3244000	and bring it back to Judith Butler.
3244720	3248240	When the anti-gender movement say that gender is an ideology
3248240	3250320	and sex is a fixed point,
3250320	3253760	we now understand they aren't making an observation,
3253760	3255680	they're making a demand.
3256480	3259280	When they say that you can't change sex,
3259280	3262640	they mean you shouldn't be allowed to
3262640	3264720	because that would be dangerous,
3264720	3267680	not the kind of danger that is proven with evidence,
3267680	3272160	but the kind they want the state to posit and punish.
3272560	3275360	What they want is morally righteous violence
3275360	3277520	that restores an imaginary order
3277520	3279920	because they are anxious about real problems
3279920	3282720	that they cannot or will not think about,
3282720	3285200	and so they can only glimpse those problems
3285200	3290400	through the prism of unreality.
3290400	3293920	The contradictory character of the phantasm
3293920	3296640	allows it to contain whatever anxiety or fear
3296640	3299200	that the anti-gender ideology wishes to stoke
3299200	3300400	for its own purposes,
3300800	3302960	without having to make any of it cohere.
3302960	3306560	Depending on the anxieties circulating in a particular region,
3306560	3309360	gender can be figured as Marxist or capitalist,
3309360	3313200	tyranny or libertarianism, fascism or totalitarianism,
3313200	3316400	a totalizing force, or an unwanted migrant.
3316400	3319360	It is not that people are unmindful of the contradiction
3319360	3320880	and need to be enlightened.
3320880	3323760	No, the contradiction itself is what works,
3323760	3326080	in effect emancipating people from the task
3326080	3328000	of developing a rational position.
3330640	3334000	Maybe it's because I'm older,
3334960	3338320	but part of the reason I came back is to tell you
3338960	3341920	life is too short to spend it being miserable.
3344000	3344960	Actually, that's the point.
3346560	3348000	How come you look younger than me?
3349760	3350560	Because I'm happier.
3351920	3352960	Joy is youthful.
3354320	3355920	Also, we get a really good skincare routine.
3356720	3358240	I don't want to think about getting older.
3358560	3361520	You know mom's fish pie recipe?
3363680	3364080	Yeah.
3364080	3366000	There's this really amazing moment that's going to happen
3366000	3367200	when you're 30.
3367200	3370080	You make that fish pie for a friend who's like 23,
3370080	3371680	and you bring it out and she says,
3371680	3373200	you are literally my mother.
3374240	3375840	And that is going to be one of the first times
3375840	3377440	you realize that we're getting older.
3378640	3380880	But it's actually nice because it's like,
3381920	3384720	we have a knowledge that younger people don't.
3385840	3387440	And it's not like a superiority thing.
3387440	3389360	It's that we get to be helpful.
3391680	3392720	We become an auntie.
3394400	3397280	We have little nieces and a nephew.
3399200	3400880	We help them put on their shoes
3400880	3403200	and they ask us to tell them about Shakespeare.
3408080	3410240	I wish I could tell you that it's all going to be moments like that.
3412400	3412960	But you're right.
3414480	3416320	Your future has ups and downs.
3416320	3417680	And it's mainly ups.
3418960	3420400	But the politics is big down.
3422640	3423440	Does it get better?
3429440	3431360	Let's talk about Brainworms.
3432720	3435680	Brainworms is a 2024 novel by Alison Rumford
3435680	3438400	about a woman who discovers that several high-ranking British politicians
3438400	3440480	and journalists are being secretly controlled
3440480	3443120	by a contagious parasite that makes them bigoted.
3443120	3444960	She has to uncover the conspiracy,
3444960	3446000	but nobody will believe her.
3446320	3448400	Because she's working class and trans.
3449200	3450480	And maybe imagining it.
3451760	3454560	I like that the worms are never confirmed to be real.
3455600	3458000	We could read them as hallucinations.
3459040	3462080	That ambiguity forces us to engage only with the metaphor.
3462800	3464080	Brainworms might not be real,
3465040	3471680	but hate is infectious, disgusting, and perverse.
3471680	3473920	One character is a famous author
3473920	3476400	who writes books about teenage witches.
3479200	3481920	There's a scene where she infects someone else,
3481920	3485760	coming close to her victim, worms dripping from her open mouth.
3485760	3487200	And she says a line.
3487760	3489440	And in the movie version, this would be the line
3489440	3492240	that reveals a glimpse of her evil plan, right?
3492960	3494080	But instead, she says,
3495440	3497600	I've seen the future of this country.
3499040	3503360	And it's going to get so much worse.
3504800	3506320	The worms don't make her happy.
3506320	3508320	In fact, they're a kind of contagious misery.
3509600	3512960	Nobody who is infected ever gets better.
3513600	3518400	So what can we do about all of the things that we have learned today?
3518400	3520960	Well, there's actually two questions rolled into one there.
3520960	3523600	The first is, what can we practically do
3523600	3525920	about the political situation that we're all living in?
3525920	3528560	And secondly, can we convince people
3528560	3531120	who are stuck inside phantasms?
3531840	3535680	So first things first, practically speaking, what can we do?
3535680	3537920	Well, if you've been watching this show for any amount of time,
3537920	3540560	you know that I hate telling people what to do or think.
3540560	3544240	But here's some suggestions, maybe.
3544240	3547920	If you're Catholic and you like buying little medals
3547920	3551440	or rosaries or chuchkies, if you have relatives who do,
3551440	3552960	maybe older relatives who do,
3553840	3556960	you might like to double check where that money is going.
3556960	3558560	If you happen to work in media,
3558720	3563600	that all of this theory could have some practical applications for you,
3563600	3565840	we might like to talk about anti-genderists
3565840	3569120	the same way we talk about anti-vaxxers or climate deniers.
3569120	3573200	For example, Mrs. X says this, which is false.
3573200	3576800	Organization Y claims this, which is pseudoscience.
3576800	3578800	Another thing that you might like to try
3578800	3581680	is using the word cisgender.
3581680	3583200	It was coined in the early 90s.
3583200	3585520	It means not transgender.
3585520	3588640	And the English language anti-gender movement hate it
3588640	3592160	because it implies that trans people and cis people
3592160	3594720	are both worth listening to.
3595440	3599520	It resists objectification by putting us on an even playing field.
3599520	3602720	Kind of like using the word straight or heterosexual
3602720	3604320	instead of saying normal.
3604320	3608400	Beyond that, Graf and Karl Schuch say we need to appreciate the fact
3608400	3612320	that right-wing populism is criticizing capitalism,
3612320	3614640	albeit in phantasmic terms.
3614640	3616720	They say we should move beyond the old idea
3616720	3618320	that the left are anti-capitalist
3618320	3620720	and the right are always pro-market.
3620720	3623200	Now some of them are, to be sure, but not all.
3623200	3625440	They say that these days a lot of people on the right
3625440	3627440	are actually criticizing capitalism
3627440	3630080	even if they don't use that kind of language.
3630080	3633040	And so sticking to the same old economic policies
3633040	3634480	we've had for the last 40 years
3634480	3638560	is leaving yourself wide open to those far right extremists.
3639200	3642320	They also say that LGBTQ stuff and gender stuff
3642320	3645600	can't really be separated from normal politics anymore
3646160	3648400	because that's how a lot of people are engaging
3648400	3650800	with normal politics these days.
3650800	3653360	The anti-gender phantasm isn't the only thing
3653360	3655520	powering the global right, to be sure,
3655520	3657520	but it's big enough that it can't be ignored.
3658560	3661360	Important lessons there for centrists, perhaps.
3661360	3665040	They recommend a strategy called populist feminism
3665040	3668800	which involves tapping into people's emotions in the moment.
3668800	3671120	An example from the UK might be the group
3671120	3673520	Sisters Uncut who've been very successful
3673520	3677200	mobilizing a broad coalition against austerity,
3677200	3680160	domestic violence cuts, police violence,
3680160	3681760	prisons, health care segregation,
3681760	3683280	arms sales to the Israeli government,
3683280	3684720	and many other things
3684720	3687040	because they recognize that all those forces
3687040	3689200	disproportionately hurt women
3689200	3692720	and therefore women can be brought together
3692720	3694480	to protest against them
3694480	3697600	if given the chance to express our feelings
3697600	3700160	of hurt and righteous anger.
3700240	3702320	There's many ways to be involved in a group like that
3702320	3704160	from actually taking Barton demonstrations
3704160	3705280	to donating money
3705280	3708320	which again empowers a broad coalition.
3708320	3710960	A broad coalition, a coalition of broads,
3710960	3714240	dames, dime pieces, chicks, dolls, all standing together.
3715120	3715920	Will it work?
3718240	3720240	Well, join me at the end of the 21st century
3720240	3722080	to see humanity's final scores.
3722080	3724480	And now our second question.
3725520	3728800	Can we reach people stuck in phantasms?
3728800	3731280	Is there a cure for brainworns?
3738000	3738800	Well, to be honest,
3738800	3740880	there's somebody who does a lot of public education.
3740880	3741920	I really hate to admit this,
3741920	3745520	but I am not optimistic that education will work.
3747520	3749040	Butler says that this movement
3749040	3752000	is not only irrational but anti-rational.
3752000	3754000	Many of the most prominent people in it
3754000	3756080	proudly do not engage
3756080	3758320	with any of the academic material on gender.
3759760	3761280	At the end of my research journey,
3761280	3764080	I realized the reason they don't listen
3764880	3766560	is because they feel that listening
3766560	3767840	is an act of submission.
3771280	3775280	And I can't help it.
3775280	3776400	I think that's really sad.
3777360	3778560	I really don't want to come across
3778560	3782240	as like patronizing or giving people
3782240	3784320	with mercy that they wouldn't give me,
3784320	3786960	but I think it is really sad
3787200	3790400	when people refuse their own complexity,
3790400	3791840	when they refuse to become
3792480	3794160	the person that they might become
3794160	3795200	if they just listened.
3797200	3800560	Indeed, there could be no greater enemy
3800560	3803920	for philosophy tube than the anti-gender phantasm.
3803920	3807360	This show is about compassion and reason
3807360	3810480	and sharing knowledge between equals.
3811680	3813440	It's born out of my belief that
3814160	3821360	thinking and research and words and writing
3823280	3824160	that they matter.
3826400	3828160	And I'm trans.
3831440	3833840	This is my final boss fight.
3835440	3838400	Informed public debate becomes impossible
3838400	3840320	when some parties refuse to read
3840320	3842320	the material under dispute.
3842400	3844320	It is nearly impossible to breach
3844320	3847120	this epistemic divide with good arguments
3847120	3848560	because of the fear that reading
3848560	3851760	will introduce confusion into the reader's mind
3851760	3854720	or bring her into direct contact with the devil.
3855360	3857040	They're skeptical of the academy
3857040	3859200	for fear that intellectual debates
3859200	3862160	may well confuse them about the values they hold.
3862880	3865920	They're refusal to care much about consistency,
3865920	3868960	to base their criticisms on a reading of the text,
3868960	3870640	their way of snatching phrases
3870640	3872240	and making them into lightning rods.
3872240	3876880	However, are all finally a refusal to think critically.
3880640	3883920	Some individual people do get better.
3886880	3887840	When we first come out,
3888720	3890560	there's going to be people who do not take it well.
3892880	3896000	But in time, they see that we are happier
3896000	3899360	and for most of them, that's enough.
3901360	3904000	I'm scared of changing.
3905920	3906480	No offence.
3909200	3910240	Yeah, well, you will change.
3912960	3914160	But you keep the good bits.
3917920	3921360	Are you still making philosophy tube in the future?
3922560	3923600	What did the audience say?
3925680	3926720	They brought them with me.
3931600	3933600	Oh, hi.
3935840	3936640	Nice to see you all.
3939360	3940320	There's more of them.
3941680	3942320	A lot more.
3958400	3958960	I love you.
3960960	3962640	I love you too.
3982960	3986400	I'd like to end by telling you my hopes for the future.
3987280	3989200	I hope that I will grow old.
3990640	3992080	I hope that when I am old,
3992080	3994880	I will still be cooking the way that my mom taught me
3994880	3997520	and that I will have the wisdom of my dad.
3998880	4002160	I hope that my nieces and my nephew grow up into good
4002160	4003200	and happy people.
4004640	4006640	I hope that I will see younger people
4006640	4008240	have opportunities that I didn't.
4009120	4011120	And I hope that I won't be too jealous.
4011760	4015440	I hope that I will be acting and making art
4015440	4017040	for the rest of my life.
4019840	4022640	I hope that this is not the cleverest
4022640	4025040	or the most compassionate that I will ever be,
4026080	4028240	but that I will continue to change.
4030080	4035200	Because the only people who don't change are the dead.
4042080	4046400	Speaking of changes,
4047520	4051280	I've been doing philosophy tube for 11 years now.
4051280	4054400	Some of you have been here that whole time.
4054400	4055680	And I don't know if you realize it,
4056240	4059360	but you have changed my life.
4060320	4062560	Off YouTube, I'm a professional actor.
4063360	4065200	YouTube kind of blew up first,
4065200	4068000	but it's always been separate from my acting career.
4068080	4071280	Until I wrote a play called The Prince,
4071280	4074960	which a lot of you came to see, so it did really well.
4074960	4077680	And then I got cast in Baldur's Gate 3.
4078320	4081280	And then I got cast in Star Wars.
4082160	4084800	And then I got cast in something that's even bigger than Star Wars
4084800	4086160	that I'm not allowed to tell you about yet.
4086880	4091040	And the engine of all of this has been you.
4091040	4094080	I used to think that I would probably have to leave YouTube behind
4094080	4095760	someday to focus on acting,
4096320	4100560	but now I realize that because of you and your lovely enthusiasm
4100560	4102960	for all of the things that I make and that I'm in,
4103920	4108560	I now realize we can combine YouTube and acting
4108560	4112560	into something more powerful than either one can be alone.
4113120	4116320	So then I was like, okay, I want to write a short film.
4116880	4117680	And I did.
4118320	4120240	It's called Dracula's Ex-Girlfriend.
4120240	4124000	It's about two vampire chicks in LA being horrible to each other.
4124000	4126880	I pitched it to a streaming service called Nebula.
4126880	4131600	I said, hey, I've got this big audience and we already had success with my play.
4131600	4133440	Do you maybe want to do a movie?
4133440	4134480	And they said, yes.
4135360	4138480	Once again, you have changed my life.
4138480	4141120	Do you know how many actors would kill to have a streaming service
4141120	4142880	pick up their debut film?
4142880	4144000	I'm going to be in it too.
4144560	4149040	My co-stars are Morgana Ignis and Brandon Rogers from Hell of a Boss,
4149040	4151760	one of the biggest shows in the world.
4151760	4155280	And you will be able to see the film when it comes out
4155280	4159600	at go.nebula.tv slash dex.
4159600	4164080	And it gets better because Nebula isn't just another streaming service.
4164080	4166640	Imagine that you had a role in a show on Disney Plus.
4166640	4169200	Say, I don't know, Star Wars the Acolyte?
4169920	4172240	Well, you do the job and you have a great time.
4172240	4174080	And at the end of the day, you go home.
4174080	4176240	Star Wars belongs to Disney.
4176960	4181600	But on Nebula, the people who create the thing own the thing.
4182000	4185600	I wrote Dracula's ex-girlfriend, so I keep the rights.
4185600	4190480	They're giving the creators more power and even better.
4190480	4192480	If you all go and get Disney Plus to watch Star Wars,
4192480	4193360	then that's really cool.
4193360	4196640	But the creators of the show don't get like a bonus or anything.
4196640	4200800	However, if you get Nebula using that link specifically,
4200800	4204880	then I get a cut and you get a discount.
4204880	4208000	$2.50 a month with an annual subscription.
4208000	4209200	So I help you.
4209200	4210640	You're helping me.
4210640	4213040	We are helping each other.
4213040	4214800	And there's even more.
4214800	4217760	If you want to see the full scene that we shot for this episode,
4217760	4221280	without all the video essay bits in between, that's on Nebula too.
4221280	4225120	Every episode of Philosophy Tube goes up there early and uncensored.
4225120	4226320	Lindsay Ellis is on there.
4226320	4227680	Legal Eagle's on there.
4227680	4229040	H-Bomber Guy's on there.
4229040	4231120	They're making a whole bunch of documentaries now.
4231120	4233920	They're making a sci-fi movie directed by Jesse Gender
4233920	4235040	that I'm going to be in.
4235040	4236240	It's called Identities.
4236240	4237440	It comes out in June.
4237440	4240800	If you get Nebula, you can see all of that.
4240800	4243840	We are combining YouTube and acting.
4243840	4246400	And we are unlocking the power.
4246400	4249680	You and I have had a lot of fun over these last 11 years.
4250560	4253040	The next step is Dracula's ex-girlfriend.
4253040	4258560	And after that, wait and see.
4267440	4284320	She's the type who will get what she wants, doesn't hide.
4284320	4291360	Always hiding the sun and it kills me slowly.
4291360	4299920	Seeing her pass me by in the city of dreams.
4299920	4304480	Wish that I had the power in me.
4304480	4312240	But I'm just too madly insecure.
4315040	4318480	All the time that I waste and always looking
4318480	4324240	at strangers thinking there's so much better than me.
4324240	4329760	All the time that I wait is they don't make it some changes.
4329760	4332720	It's crazy.
4332720	4335280	Who's that girl?
4335280	4339920	She walks around like she could rule the world.
4339920	4345040	She goes for everything that she deserves.
4345040	4349600	Say what would it take for me to be like her?
4349600	4354160	I want it out.
4354160	4358720	I want it out.
4358720	4362160	Because I just want to be somebody.
4362160	4364160	Not just anybody.
4364160	4366160	Tell me who's that?
4366160	4367600	Who's that?
4367600	4368560	Who's that?
4368560	4373120	In your eyes, there's a sense of belief.
4373120	4375600	I just cry.
4375600	4382560	I'm a pretty party and I'm getting nowhere.
4382560	4394000	When she comes first, how can I get some confidence with my mind?
4394000	4396000	Never wants to be friends.
4396000	4406000	It just keeps comparing me to her.
4406000	4408480	Who's that girl?
4408480	4413040	She walks around like she could rule the world.
4413040	4418240	She goes for everything that she deserves.
4418240	4422800	Say what would it take for me to be like her?
4422800	4426720	I want to know who's that girl.
4426720	4431280	She's got a power like we're all here.
4431280	4436480	I bet she's got to make me wait when it works.
4436480	4441040	Say what would it take for me to be like her?
4441040	4445600	I want it out.
4445600	4450240	I want it out.
4450240	4453680	Because I just want to be somebody.
4453680	4455680	Not just anybody.
4455680	4457680	Tell me who's that?
4457680	4459680	Who's that?
4459680	4463680	Who's that girl?
4463680	4467680	Who's that girl?
4467680	4471680	Because I just want to be somebody.
4471680	4473680	Not just anybody.
4473680	4475680	Tell me who's that?
4475680	4477680	Who's that?
4477920	4479920	Who's that girl?
4489920	4491920	You can moonwalk and live your talent.
4491920	4493920	Apparently.
4495920	4497920	That's it, that's the end of the video.
4497920	4500160	I'm just kidding.
