00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
Judith Butler might be the most misunderstood philosopher in the world,

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,280
so I decided to read as much of their work as I could in one month.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,360
Actually, I read it in like four months, but YouTube videos need narrative now.

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,160
Butler has been writing for over 40 years about a lot of things, including gender.

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,920
If you've ever heard the idea that gender is performative, that's them.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,800
Their work has also been the subject of huge backlash,

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,600
like in 2017, protesters in Brazil burned an effigy of Judith Butler.

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,840
Philosophy doesn't usually get that spicy.

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,560
I must have missed the effigy making class during my degree.

10
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,520
Interestingly, the people with the strongest reactions to Butler

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,560
often haven't understood or even read their work,

12
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,600
and now they have a new book about the backlash.

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,840
Who's Afraid of Gender?

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,360
I've deliberately filmed the bulk of this video on a white void background

15
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,960
with minimal costumes.

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,760
Kind of an old-fashioned style on YouTube these days,

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,760
but I wanted to get across the idea that as controversial as this stuff might be,

18
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,880
there's nothing hidden.

19
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,360
You're not committing yourself to anything by hearing it.

20
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,120
It's just an invitation to listen and consider a different point of view.

21
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,240
And really, that's a skill we could all do with practicing,

22
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,000
because this philosophy has huge real-world implications.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,240
I was inspired to take this research journey

24
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,800
when I read this article in The Washington Post.

25
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,840
Students from E.C. Glass High School in Lynchburg, Virginia,

26
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,240
applied for a grant from It Gets Better,

27
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,960
a non-profit dedicated to kids' mental health.

28
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,080
And they got it.

29
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,920
They were awarded $10,000 to put a chill-out room in their school,

30
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,520
a space with comfy chairs and relaxed lighting to go if they're stressed.

31
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:31,920
Nice.

32
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,880
But the school board sent the money back.

33
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,560
They said that if they took it,

34
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,920
students would have to watch pro-LGBTQ videos, which wasn't true.

35
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,480
It Gets Better does focus on helping LGBTQ kids,

36
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,080
but the room would have been open to anyone,

37
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,720
and the grant had no requirements about watching anything.

38
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,200
But the board wouldn't listen.

39
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,920
The board discussed this for longer than they discussed

40
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,920
the literal closure of two entire schools in their district.

41
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,600
And that stunned me.

42
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,480
A school board rejected $10,000 of free money

43
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,960
and talked about something that isn't true for so long.

44
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,040
It impaired their ability to work.

45
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,800
So what happened here?

46
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,320
Why couldn't they listen?

47
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,720
This polarization is exactly what Butler's interested in.

48
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,440
I'll take you through their technical philosophy.

49
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,840
Although really, I wish I could just show you,

50
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,840
because I'm somebody whose mind has definitely changed on these issues.

51
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,080
But it's not like I can just go back in time

52
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,080
and talk to my past self.

53
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,360
Oh my god.

54
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,080
These Maddlings are amazing.

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,600
So, you're surprised?

56
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:49,840
Yeah.

57
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,120
Fair.

58
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,000
But how surprised are you, really?

59
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,240
You look like Mum.

60
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:02,800
Right?

61
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,080
You sound different.

62
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,400
Seattle Voice Lab.

63
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:06,880
Look them up.

64
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,920
I can turn it on and off whenever I want.

65
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,520
So in about three years, we have to move flats.

66
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,760
And the internet contract is in your name.

67
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,360
So when I call to cancel it,

68
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,480
they won't talk to me.

69
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,400
And I have to say, hang on a minute.

70
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,680
I'll go get him and do your voice.

71
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,640
Turn the phone.

72
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,280
I'll be Mum and Dad.

73
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:29,680
Take it.

74
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,360
Really well, actually.

75
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,840
There's this nice moment in about three years

76
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,200
when you and Dad are going to be out.

77
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,320
Actually, I think you're gone by this point.

78
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,040
It's just me and him.

79
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,360
And we bump into small family friends

80
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,560
and they're super awkward about it.

81
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,800
And Dad's just like, whatever, their problem.

82
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,160
He's not embarrassed.

83
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,000
Why would he be embarrassed?

84
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,160
Were you dressed like this?

85
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,680
Address however I want.

86
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,560
Dude, that's the whole point.

87
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,400
The whole thing is so liberating.

88
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,160
Seriously, you are going to love it.

89
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,840
Just the freedom to be.

90
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,600
I don't want to be like you.

91
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,280
Why not?

92
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,320
Let's talk about Fem boys.

93
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,920
I began at the beginning.

94
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,920
Butler's 1988 paper,

95
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,640
Performative Acts and Gender Constitution,

96
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,040
one of the first things they ever wrote.

97
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,880
And right up top, we should acknowledge,

98
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,160
Butler's academic writing can sometimes be pretty difficult.

99
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,120
And that's fair enough.

100
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,520
Gender is a difficult subject.

101
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,840
Mine took me two attempts.

102
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,120
What made it click for me is it reminded me of a friend

103
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,160
who will call F.

104
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,600
F is very cool, clever and funny.

105
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,680
And unpretentious, the kind of person who turns up

106
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,440
to a fancy restaurant wearing a trucker hat.

107
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,920
F is also a Fem boy.

108
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,320
Fem boys take on attributes

109
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,000
that are typically considered feminine,

110
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,040
but they are not themselves women, usually.

111
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,800
Fem boy is also a genre of online content.

112
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,480
F dresses up like a girl

113
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,480
and streams themselves playing video games.

114
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:11,680
When I first met F, I wondered, is Fem boy a gender?

115
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,840
Well, it's less a thing that you are

116
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,040
and more a thing that you do like a job.

117
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,320
And interestingly, because the Fem boy aesthetic

118
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,800
is so shaped by online content,

119
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,240
to do Fem boy in a way that other people will recognize

120
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,720
requires you to adopt certain behaviors

121
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,400
and stylized practices

122
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,040
whose meaning is not determined by you.

123
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,240
You can't choose what the trends are,

124
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,520
what styles of makeup or dress signal Fem boy.

125
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,080
You've got to learn them and do them

126
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,920
if you want to be seen that way.

127
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,000
And F works pretty hard at that.

128
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,360
If you're very clever,

129
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,920
you'll already have guessed where this is going.

130
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,200
According to Butler, all gender works that way.

131
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,800
In this paper, they say that gender is a thing

132
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,120
we do through repeated, stylized acts.

133
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,480
Not a property, but an embodied event.

134
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,400
Those acts get their meaning from a social world.

135
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,960
So in a way, gender is also a thing that is done to us.

136
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,360
Gender is in no way a stable identity

137
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,920
or locus of agency from which various acts proceed.

138
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,720
Rather, it's an identity tenuously constituted in time,

139
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,640
an identity instituted through a stylized repetition of acts.

140
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,400
Further, gender is instituted through a stylization of the body

141
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,880
and hence must be understood as the mundane way

142
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,280
in which bodily gestures, movements and enactments

143
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,960
of various kinds constitute the illusion of an abiding gendered self.

144
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,720
You're ridiculous.

145
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,240
Says discount Tom Hiddleston.

146
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,240
Your face doesn't look like me anymore.

147
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,720
Did you get plastic surgery on my face?

148
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,320
Well, there's no plastic in me, babes.

149
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,200
I'm all natural.

150
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,120
Artificial surgery makes you natural, does it?

151
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,480
At first glance, Butler's ideas seemed a little strange to me

152
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,920
because we often talk as if gender is an inner truth.

153
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,440
For example, when people change gender and come out,

154
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,480
we're often said to be living authentically or being true to ourselves.

155
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:17,680
Even the term coming out implies that there was an authentic self before who was hidden.

156
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,520
But according to Butler, there might be no such thing.

157
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:28,000
It's not that I exist and then I choose to perform gender in ways that you will recognize.

158
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,480
I can't even form a concept of I without using gendered language

159
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,800
and stylized practices whose meaning exists prior to me.

160
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,240
Gender is one of the ways that human subjects come into existence.

161
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:48,960
The technical term here is subjectification, and that process happens publicly.

162
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,480
Gender creates the illusion of a private self which exists before all of that,

163
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,960
but this is just an illusion.

164
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,840
If a tree falls in the forest and nobody's around to hear it,

165
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,560
it has no pronouns.

166
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,160
Herein lies the distinction between performative and performance,

167
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,360
which are often mixed up.

168
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,120
When people say gender is a performance,

169
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,160
they mean that people exist first without gender,

170
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,240
and then they put on costumes or makeup or wigs the way that an actor does.

171
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,800
But that's not what Butler is saying.

172
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,040
Performative is a technical philosophy term

173
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:31,440
for when you say something and by saying it, you also do it.

174
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:37,120
For example, if you say I promise, you say the words and you make a promise.

175
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,840
If a judge says I sentence you, they say it and they do it.

176
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:47,040
When Butler says that gender is performative, they mean it that way.

177
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:54,960
You do it and you make it so, and indeed by doing it, you are made so.

178
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,600
And people have made fun of Butler for this idea.

179
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,400
I've seen people say, oh, Judith Butler says,

180
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,120
you can just choose to be any gender you want.

181
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,360
Oh, I men can choose to be women and women can choose to be baboons

182
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,680
and I can choose to be an attack helicopter.

183
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,280
Ha ha, how silly.

184
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,360
But when I actually read their work,

185
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,000
I realized that's not what they're saying at all.

186
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,640
Our very concept of ourselves as gendered subjects requires a social world.

187
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,680
We depend on others for the recognition we need to become gendered subjects.

188
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,600
We can still make some choices where whatever clothes or makeup you like,

189
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,280
but the meaning of those things is not within our soul control.

190
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:41,520
People have been making jokes like that about Butler for decades,

191
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:48,560
even though they address this misunderstanding in their first paper, in the first paragraph.

192
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:55,040
Almost like the people mocking them aren't really listening.

193
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,560
There is no volitional subject behind the mime who decides, as it were,

194
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,000
which gender it will be today.

195
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,280
On the contrary, the very possibility of becoming a viable subject

196
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,040
requires that a certain gender mime be already underway.

197
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,360
I didn't come back here to argue with you, I'm trying to help.

198
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,720
I don't believe it, it's a trick.

199
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,960
You were born in your castle.

200
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,560
Your favourite fruit is Chinese.

201
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,400
Your first crush was named Flossy.

202
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,360
No, no, no, you could have tortured me and got in that information.

203
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:27,680
What?

204
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,080
Well, I don't know, you could have gotten it out on me somehow in the future.

205
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,680
Just listen to me, we're the same height, we have the same eyes.

206
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,440
Your body's completely different.

207
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,200
Yes, that's the point.

208
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,200
Human bodies can't change that much.

209
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:39,680
We can!

210
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,400
Even if you are, even if you are, even if you are, even if you are.

211
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,320
Let's talk about Kristen Stewart.

212
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,040
Next on my reading list was Butler's famous 1990 book Gender Trouble.

213
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,640
But it's pretty tough and technical, so we could use a bit of a run-up.

214
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,040
We can actually start with this.

215
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,560
In March 2024, actor Kristen Stewart appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone, looking…

216
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,120
In the interview, Stewart said,

217
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,920
I want to do the gayest f***ing thing you've ever seen in your life.

218
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:20,480
If I could grow a little mustache, if I could grow a f***ing happy trail and unbutton my pants,

219
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,800
I would.

220
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,600
Later at the Berlin Film Festival, she added,

221
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:31,200
The existence of a female body thrusting any type of sexuality at you that's not designed for

222
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:37,440
or desired by exclusively cis straight males is something people are not super comfy with.

223
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,600
And so I am really happy with it.

224
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,280
I had a great time.

225
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,520
A lot of people think that there's a difference between sex and gender.

226
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,680
Sex is supposed to be the physical thing, some combination of genes or genitals or gametes,

227
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,760
or maybe it's something in your brain, but it's there in the world.

228
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:01,280
And gender is just what we do with it, or at least that's how the story goes.

229
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:05,200
It might be helpful to know something of the history of that idea.

230
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,360
For millennia, male-dominated societies exploited women

231
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,960
and justified it by claiming that we are naturally inferior.

232
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,480
From Greek and Roman philosophers saying that women can't be educated,

233
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,480
to Victorian doctors saying that we are too emotional to vote, to today.

234
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:26,880
Some people still say women are by nature not equipped to live as equal members of society.

235
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,720
Oh, she could never lead a nation.

236
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,800
What if she got her period and started a war?

237
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,600
Misogyny has consistently justified itself by appealing to

238
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,520
facts about our bodies that are simply made up.

239
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,800
If you'd like to know more about the history of this practice, then I really recommend

240
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,320
The Once and Future Sex by historian Eleanor Yanagher.

241
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,160
Into this context comes French philosopher Simone de Beauvoir,

242
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:58,320
whose landmark book The Second Sex comes out in 1949 and opens with this sentence.

243
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,920
One is not born, but rather becomes a woman.

244
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,440
De Beauvoir challenges this history, saying that whilst there are facts about female biology,

245
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,080
male-dominated society also makes a lot of stuff up and claims that the stuff it makes up is facts.

246
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:19,680
The technical term here is naturalization, making something appear natural.

247
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,080
For example, women are denied the vote?

248
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,560
Well, it's not because we live in an unequal society,

249
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,040
it's because the female brain just can't handle it because of biology.

250
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:38,240
So, she says, one is born female, but woman is a socially constructed ideal of subordination,

251
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,640
that we are encouraged to embrace and punished for defying.

252
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:48,960
And then, in the 1980s, along come French philosophers Monique Wittig and Michel Foucault,

253
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:54,640
who say this sex versus gender distinction is just another layer of control.

254
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:02,880
De Beauvoir thinks that woman is an oppressive social construct, but female somehow isn't?

255
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,760
Human beings are 99.9% identical. Who does it serve to split hairs about the remaining 0.1%?

256
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,200
Defining one half of the human species in terms of our capacity to carry babies and be fertile

257
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:21,280
and straight and thereby participate in systems of property and inheritance overwhelmingly controlled

258
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:28,080
by men? Does that sound like a natural distinction? Or does it sound like a political one?

259
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:34,080
Wittig actually says that women should reject womanhood entirely by becoming lesbians,

260
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:38,560
rejecting the patriarchal categories of both woman and female.

261
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:44,720
Categories which she says only make sense inside the heterosexual matrix.

262
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:51,840
Do not try and change sex. That's impossible. Instead, only try to realize the truth.

263
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:59,440
There is no sex. We've been compelled in our bodies and in our minds to correspond

264
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,520
feature by feature with the idea of nature that has been established for us,

265
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:08,160
distorted to such an extent that our deformed body is what they call natural,

266
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:13,040
what is supposed to exist as such before oppression, distorted to such an extent

267
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,520
that in the end oppression seems to be a consequence of this nature within ourselves.

268
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:23,440
By admitting that there is a natural division between women and men, we naturalize history.

269
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,080
Not only do we naturalize history, but also consequently we naturalize the social phenomena

270
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:34,160
which express our oppression, making change impossible. Lesbian is the only concept I know

271
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:40,640
of which is beyond the categories of sex, woman and man, because the designated subject, lesbian,

272
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,800
is not a woman, either economically or politically or ideologically.

273
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:50,080
For what makes a woman is a specific social relation to a man, a relation that we have

274
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:55,280
previously called servitude, a relation which implies personal and physical obligation as well

275
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:00,080
as economic obligation, forced residence, domestic corvée, conjugal duties, unlimited production

276
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:06,480
of children, etc. A relation which lesbians escape by refusing to become or stay heterosexual.

277
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,120
I'm not sure that I personally agree with everything Wittig says, but it's a provocative

278
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:17,760
thought, worth listening to, and in gender trouble, Butler thinks so too. They say we should

279
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:24,640
question the idea that sex is a natural category. That might sound very out there, but just listen

280
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:30,240
for a moment. Once upon a time, people believed that race was a natural category. They wrote

281
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,120
scientific papers about it and measured people's skulls and took blood samples and they believed

282
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,720
that it was real. Nowadays we know that race is a political grouping that was naturalized,

283
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,720
made to look natural, in large part to justify slavery. And we also know that sex was a big

284
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:53,520
part of that. Black women and white women were categorized very differently. So are you certain

285
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:59,440
that the distinction between male and female is as secure as you've been told?

286
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,400
Who told you that?

287
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:06,960
Why did they tell you it?

288
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,080
And who benefits from you continuing to believe it?

289
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,920
You think that's pussy you're eating now?

290
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:19,440
This is the artistic space that Christian Stewart's photo shoot is playing in. The

291
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:26,560
piece and Stewart's comments engage in what Butler calls re-signification, giving a new

292
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:32,800
meaning to something. In this case, Stewart's body. The question it poses is, what if this

293
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:42,720
is also female? What does that tell us about the sense or non-sense of gendered categories?

294
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:51,200
But if sex isn't real, then why did I go through all the trouble of changing mine?

295
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,440
It's a blunt question, but it's not an unfair one.

296
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:03,360
So when I finished gender trouble, I also read this, Whipping Girl by Julius Serrano. Serrano

297
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:09,600
is a biologist. She believes in what she calls subconscious sex, something in the brain that

298
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,960
expects the body to be a certain way. She thinks this would explain the existence of people like

299
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:22,960
me and also her, whose gender just feels right. It's an interesting idea, and I think it gets

300
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:30,480
to the heart of an intuition a lot of us have to go, look, like physical differences are there.

301
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,480
We can see them. Some human beings can get pregnant and others can't. Like,

302
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,080
is Butler really saying that all of that isn't real? But then I read the book again,

303
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:46,400
and it turns out that's also a misunderstanding. Butler's not saying that the physical world

304
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,720
isn't there or even that it's unknowable. They're just saying that whatever facts

305
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:58,480
there might be about biological sex, we can only learn them and talk about them through gender.

306
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:05,440
To say the sentence, my brain expects my body to be female, is to draw on a particular understanding

307
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,040
of the word female. And while we're at it, a particular understanding of the meaning of the

308
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:16,400
words my and body, that get their meaning from a social world. I've seen some more recent philosophers

309
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:23,040
use the term sex slash gender, and even sex slash gender slash race. And now I understand why we

310
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:28,080
can't really think about those things separately. It's not that there's sex, the biological reality,

311
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:33,440
and then there's gender on top of it. It's all gender. It's all gender.

312
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:39,440
Or why it has been. Physical features appear to be in some sense there on the far side of language,

313
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,480
unmarked by a social system. It is unclear, however, that these features could be named

314
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,680
in a way that would not reproduce the reductive operation of the categories of sex. In other words,

315
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:56,240
sex imposes an artificial unity on an otherwise discontinuous set of attributes. As both discursive

316
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:03,040
and perceptual, sex denotes a historically contingent epistemic regime, a language that forms

317
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:07,920
perception by forcibly shaping the interrelationships through which physical bodies are perceived.

318
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,520
The existence and facticity of the material or natural dimensions of the body are not denied,

319
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,000
but reconceived as distinct from the process by which the body comes to bear cultural meanings.

320
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:23,600
If gender is the cultural significance that the sexed body assumes, and if that significance

321
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,760
is co-determined through various acts in their cultural perception, then it would appear that

322
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:33,520
from within the terms of culture, it is not possible for no sex as distinct from gender.

323
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,800
A woman is a human being who belongs to the sex class that produces large gametes.

324
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,840
May I suggest also posting interesting and positive content on other matters?

325
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,920
I live in England, where a lot of people are talking about sex at the moment.

326
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:22,640
Some say that sex is a fixed point that cannot be changed or signified or questioned,

327
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,440
whereas gender is just a nebulous feeling or a contested belief.

328
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,960
I thought all that feminist philosophy was pretty interesting,

329
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:37,920
but it seems some people don't want to listen.

330
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:57,600
What if they walk in now and say you made a mistake?

331
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,200
Then I made the mistake you wanted to make.

332
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,040
Better the devil you know than the devil you don't.

333
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,600
The gates of hell are locked from the inside.

334
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,360
What makes me suspicious, right?

335
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,560
Is you're coming in here going, oh, everything's wonderful, right?

336
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,520
Trying to convince me, but you don't mention any downsides.

337
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,800
Of course there's downsides.

338
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,360
Well go on then.

339
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,800
Street harassment?

340
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,880
Men are going to shout at you in the street.

341
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,480
Men push into you and interrupt you.

342
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,280
And?

343
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,760
And it's scary sometimes being a woman.

344
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,440
There's this girl called Sarah Everard.

345
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,560
She's going to get murdered in 2021 by a police officer.

346
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,000
It's a big thing.

347
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,880
It's on all the news.

348
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,520
And I have a vigil for her in London.

349
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,960
Women come from all over the country.

350
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,280
And the police beat and arrest the women at the vigil.

351
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,760
And you're going to see that and you're going to feel scared because it's like,

352
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,760
wow, this is how they treat us.

353
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,160
Were you there?

354
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:05,940
No.

355
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,960
I didn't feel entitled to.

356
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:12,820
Good.

357
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,840
The body we have is threatening.

358
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:20,240
It wouldn't be appropriate for us to be out and about violence against women.

359
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,200
We're not violent.

360
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:27,040
I mean, we're like tall, but so are giraffes.

361
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,680
Bodies are just bodies.

362
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,280
I wish I had been there.

363
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,400
We need all the allies we can get.

364
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,880
I tell you this, you're going to have to go through so much bullshit just to get health care.

365
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,080
And all of that comes from this place of being like, oh,

366
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,000
everybody needs to fit a strict definition.

367
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,360
Everyone has to be in a little box.

368
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,360
I'll do what I want and I'll help who I can.

369
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,280
Let's talk about feminism.

370
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,760
If there is no natural category of sex,

371
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,480
then how can we argue for women's rights?

372
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,840
That's a question some people are asking.

373
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,520
And I'll admit I was curious.

374
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,720
I've seen some say that Butler is erasing women

375
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,400
and that in order to protect us from things like discrimination and assault,

376
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:21,120
the law needs a strict definition of women grounded in facts about biological sex.

377
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,120
Thing is, I happen to know just off my own bat that that's actually incorrect.

378
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:30,800
For example, suppose an employer denies a job to a candidate named Hillary because they think,

379
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:35,920
oh, women, women be shopping, women are unreliable employees, application denied.

380
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,760
Only it turns out Hillary is Hillary with one L. The candidate is a man.

381
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,680
In that case, the employer can still be guilty of sexual discrimination,

382
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:47,760
even though their definition of what a woman is, is false and didn't even apply.

383
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,360
The same principle also goes in crimes like assault.

384
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,880
If a straight person gets attacked coming out of a gay club,

385
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,080
that can still be a homophobic hate crime if the suspect

386
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,000
believes that they're gay and attacks them for that reason.

387
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,120
What matters in law is the suspect's actions and motivations,

388
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,600
not whether the victim meets a particular definition.

389
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,400
Even though this is a matter of settled law,

390
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:16,160
some people still insist that a strict definition is required,

391
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:20,880
almost like those people aren't listening.

392
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,040
But anyway, wouldn't it still be useful to have some definition of women,

393
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,240
even if we all know it's kind of vague and loose?

394
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,520
Could it be useful as a political standard to rally around?

395
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,640
I read Butler's 1991 paper, Imitation and Gender Subordination,

396
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,200
which is partly about this definition question.

397
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,960
They say that defining womanhood has been,

398
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,560
and still is, a key strategy of patriarchy.

399
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,960
And that's what de Beauvoir was writing about in the 40s.

400
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:59,040
Trying to set an exact definition is always going to be an exclusionary project,

401
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:03,440
whereas a certain amount of grey area would be more inclusive.

402
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,520
Indeed, they say that any category like gay, lesbian, trans,

403
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,280
femboy, imposes limits.

404
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,720
And trying to make everybody fit one specific box

405
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,400
as if they must have some inner self that corresponds to one of them

406
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,400
is just a bad idea.

407
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,040
And I understood where Butler was coming from there.

408
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:28,560
In Britain, trans people are often expected to tell doctors

409
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,800
a certain story about our lives.

410
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,760
We're supposed to say, oh, ever since I was a child,

411
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,920
I called myself Wendy and wore my mother's dresses,

412
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,840
and if your life doesn't fit that narrative,

413
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,160
it can be very hard to get medical care.

414
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:46,160
The concept of an authentic inner self that needs to be discovered

415
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:50,400
and verified and checked and meet somebody else's definition

416
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,800
is used against a fact.

417
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:57,120
Identity categories tend to be instruments of regulatory regimes,

418
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,120
whether as the normalizing categories of oppressive structures

419
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,400
or as the rallying points for a liberatory contestation of that very oppression.

420
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,320
That is not to say that I will not appear at political occasions

421
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,080
under the sign of lesbian,

422
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,280
but that I would like to have it permanently unclear

423
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,000
what precisely that sign signifies.

424
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,760
Which version of lesbian or gay ought to be rendered visible

425
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,160
and which internal exclusions will that rendering visible institute?

426
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:30,000
Can the visibility of identity suffice as a political strategy?

427
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,160
Or can it only be the starting point for a strategic intervention

428
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,040
which calls for a transformation of policy?

429
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:40,400
Is it not a sign of despair over public politics

430
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,120
when identity becomes its own policy,

431
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,560
bringing with it those who would police it from various sides?

432
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,240
You know what else to tell you, man?

433
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,240
Change is difficult, but it is possible.

434
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,480
This is going to f**k up our career.

435
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,320
On the contrary.

436
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,640
It's going to f**k up our love life.

437
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,280
On the contrary.

438
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,000
Well look, as far as anyone knows right now,

439
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,840
I'm a cis-het white guy, right?

440
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,360
Like I'm top of the pile.

441
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,320
Surely it would be easier to not change.

442
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,160
Oh yeah, way easier.

443
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,360
If you want to be depressed every day of your life

444
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,960
and kill yourself at 35.

445
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,760
You know what I mean?

446
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,360
Politically things aren't great in my time.

447
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,320
I assume in the future they do not vastly improve.

448
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,520
Let's talk about 9-11 and dicks.

449
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,760
Oh this is where things get silly and then they get very not silly.

450
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,200
A penis is an organ of the human body.

451
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,080
It has nerves and blood vessels and skin and so on.

452
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:47,040
Its primary function is to allow women who have one to pee standing up

453
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,080
if the toilet of the train carriage that you're in is really gross.

454
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,920
And it also does some other stuff.

455
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,520
Remember what we said earlier though?

456
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,760
It's not that there's the physical organ

457
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,520
and then a bunch of other social constructee stuff on top.

458
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,480
According to Butler, we can only know the body

459
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,760
through the social world of symbolic meanings.

460
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,000
So that particular organ often means power,

461
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,600
strength, domination, particularly when used for penetration,

462
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,920
and the threat of male violence.

463
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,000
That bundle of cultural and symbolic meanings

464
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,640
is what philosophers call the phallus.

465
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,400
Can a woman have a penis?

466
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,200
This question was a fad in British media a year or two ago.

467
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,240
Journalists kept ambushing politicians with it and watching them struggle.

468
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,600
But really the answer is quite simple.

469
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:38,320
In Britain, you can change your legal sex without surgery.

470
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,560
Because international human rights law recognizes it's probably morally wrong

471
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,200
to make a certain group of people undergo expensive, difficult,

472
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,280
potentially risky invasive medical procedures

473
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,480
that they may not want in order to do things like get married.

474
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,200
So if you are assigned male at birth,

475
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,360
you can change your legal sex in Britain

476
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,440
and become a woman without surgery.

477
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,840
It's not an easy process, but surgery isn't mandatory.

478
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,200
If you like your dick, you can keep it.

479
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,200
Beyond the legal situation though,

480
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,560
if a person assigned male takes feminizing hormones,

481
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,360
then their body will change and that includes their genitals,

482
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,200
which can change a lot more than you might think.

483
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,560
In some cases, it essentially becomes a large clitoris

484
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,800
incapable of erection or penetration.

485
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,400
And whether you want to call that a female penis or a feminine penis

486
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,800
or whether you think there's not much distinction there,

487
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,000
legally and medically, the facts are in.

488
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,120
Can a woman have a penis?

489
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,560
Yeah.

490
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:37,520
And yet, people who haven't experienced all that for themselves

491
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,760
often don't listen to those who have.

492
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,040
Maybe you were giggling when I told you all of that stuff.

493
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,480
The idea of a female penis is so unimaginable

494
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,720
that it's like a punchline, right?

495
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,280
Despite the fact that it is just a normal thing

496
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,080
that some people have.

497
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,680
It appears funny and unexpected.

498
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,240
The idea of resignifying that, using it differently,

499
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,680
but not wrongly, not powerful, not for penetration,

500
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,680
not even male, appears to be almost a contradiction

501
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,720
because that bundle of cultural and symbolic meanings

502
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,040
has been naturalized, made to seem natural.

503
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,760
And this is a very common mistake.

504
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,080
We might even call it a fallacy.

505
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:33,200
All of this is deeply funny until the second it affects government policy.

506
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,080
In February 2023, British Justice Secretary Dominic Robb

507
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,840
announced that from now on, women who have male genitalia

508
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,800
who are arrested will be sent to a men's prison,

509
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,400
regardless of what we look like,

510
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,960
regardless of whether we have legally changed sex

511
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,680
and regardless of what we are charged with.

512
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:55,040
If, for example, I was arrested at a protest,

513
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,120
if I was wrongfully arrested for something,

514
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,360
I would be sent to a men's prison.

515
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,720
And I'm sure you can imagine, although you may not want to,

516
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,880
how that might go.

517
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,920
There isn't really any good kind of prison,

518
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:12,880
but this policy makes prison worse for a certain section of the population

519
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,320
because of the way that we are born.

520
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,920
And in that regard, it's ethically unusual.

521
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,000
It's normally a principle of justice

522
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,640
that similar crimes should carry similar sentences,

523
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,560
but in my home country,

524
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,920
the same crime might carry a much harsher prison sentence

525
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,040
if you're a trans woman.

526
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,320
This discrimination is justified by politicians

527
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,400
by appealing to the supposed threat that penises carry.

528
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,160
But remember, it's regardless of our crime

529
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,280
or what our particular bodies are capable of.

530
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,080
And that's quite philosophically interesting.

531
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,680
They say that we are a threat,

532
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:53,840
but they are not listening to any actual facts about us.

533
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,840
Since that 2023 announcement,

534
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,320
I'd been trying to understand and listen

535
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,160
to the justice secretary's perspective

536
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,080
and work my way through the fear.

537
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,240
So the next item on my reading list was Butler's 2003 volume

538
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,600
Precarious Life.

539
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,000
They write about 9-11 and the war on terror.

540
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,360
In particular, the people who were detained indefinitely

541
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,840
in Guantanamo Bay by the U.S. government.

542
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,240
Terror suspects.

543
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,160
And suspects is a key word there,

544
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,960
because many of those imprisoned were never given a trial.

545
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,200
Some of them were never even charged.

546
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,560
The government said those people had to be imprisoned

547
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,760
because they were dangerous,

548
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:37,600
but not the kind of danger that they could prove in a trial.

549
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,400
The danger that these prisoners are said to pose

550
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,040
is unlike dangers that might be substantiated

551
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,680
in a court of law and redressed through punishment.

552
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:50,000
Establishing dangerousness is not the same as establishing guilt.

553
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,000
A certain level of dangerousness takes a human being

554
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,920
outside the bounds of law

555
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:59,600
and even outside the bounds of the military tribunal itself

556
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,240
makes that human into the state's possession,

557
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,080
infinitely detainable.

558
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:10,080
What counts as dangerous is what is deemed dangerous by the state,

559
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:14,560
so that, once again, the state posits what is dangerous

560
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,200
and in so doing establishes the conditions

561
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,760
for its own preemption and usurpation of the law.

562
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,560
If a person is deemed dangerous,

563
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,640
then it is no longer a matter of deciding whether criminal acts occurred.

564
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:32,080
Indeed, deeming someone dangerous is an unsubstantiated judgment

565
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:35,520
that in these cases works to preempt determinations

566
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,440
for which evidence is required.

567
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,040
If you're very clever, you'll already have realised

568
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,160
that when governments call people dangerous in this way,

569
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,040
they're using performative speech.

570
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,320
They say it, and they make it so.

571
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,400
But what's happening here isn't subjectification,

572
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:00,000
it's abjectification, creating non-subjects,

573
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,800
non-people who exist outside the law

574
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,440
and who can therefore be treated any way the government likes.

575
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,000
We don't need trials and evidence for them

576
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,360
because they're the bad guys.

577
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,560
If they have their rights violated or they die,

578
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,240
well, you shouldn't care about that

579
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,760
because they were never really alive in a way that mattered.

580
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,720
In fact, if you do care about what happens to them,

581
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,840
then that's suspicious.

582
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:28,240
You're not going to sympathise with the bad guys, are you?

583
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,520
If you've been watching the news lately, you might be wondering,

584
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,800
the people of Gaza keep being killed,

585
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,680
but Western governments aren't listening.

586
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,360
Is that maybe an example of abjectification?

587
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,480
And according to Butler, the answer is yes.

588
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,040
They are a longtime supporter of Palestinian rights

589
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,320
and have often used their position as a public Jewish academic

590
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,120
to call on the Israeli government to meet their obligations

591
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,120
under international human rights law.

592
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,800
Butler says abjectification is a tool of government

593
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,920
in the 21st century that we need to watch out for.

594
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,440
When the powers that be say a certain group of people

595
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,360
are inherently dangerous,

596
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,480
whether they're Muslims or Palestinians or trans people,

597
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,000
that's them trying to use performative speech

598
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,680
to make that group of people impossible to listen to.

599
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,840
We become not subjects, but abjects.

600
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,760
A problem to be managed against our will

601
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,720
in the name of a public good that does not recognise us as part of the public.

602
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,240
And I'm not drawing a moral equivalence between those three groups,

603
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,640
I'm just highlighting this technique of government,

604
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,000
making you aware of it,

605
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,320
because you never know when the powers that be

606
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,040
might decide to use it on you.

607
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,600
Yeah, you're right about that.

608
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,800
Politics in the future gets weird.

609
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,360
How do you mean weird?

610
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,120
Let's talk about JK Rowling.

611
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,920
We come at last to Butler's new book,

612
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,240
Who's Afraid of Gender.

613
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,560
In recent years, scholars have been studying the rise

614
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,440
of the global anti-gender movement,

615
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:25,760
a network of people including far-right political actors,

616
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,200
religious fundamentalists,

617
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,920
and a lot of people who are neither.

618
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,880
Sometimes it's a literal network of politicians and activists

619
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,720
working together behind the scenes,

620
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,360
but sometimes it's more of a loose association.

621
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,960
They oppose women's rights, especially abortion,

622
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,520
LGBTQ rights, and they strongly oppose trans people.

623
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,200
There is a part of the movement that emerged from radical feminism,

624
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,960
and that part tends to get a lot of attention,

625
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,560
especially here on YouTube.

626
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,440
Here's three great videos if you're interested,

627
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,680
but the movement as a whole is mainly men

628
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,120
and supports policies that would harm the vast majority of women.

629
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,000
Women play an important role in selling it

630
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,760
and helping it appear benign

631
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,880
because protecting women is always good PR,

632
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,440
but they aren't the core.

633
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,200
The core is the fight against gender ideology,

634
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,360
but there's not much agreement on what that actually means.

635
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,640
In Eastern Europe, they say that gender ideology

636
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,280
is spread by the UN and the EU,

637
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,480
but in Italy, they say it's spread by African migrants.

638
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,000
In Latin America, gender ideology means feminism,

639
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,480
but in the UK, they say it's against feminism.

640
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,080
In Florida, they say it's gay.

641
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,000
In the UK, they say it's homophobic.

642
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,200
They say that gender ideology is the new conversion therapy,

643
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,680
but some anti-gender organisations are in favour of conversion therapy.

644
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,240
Gender ideology is spread by woke students

645
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,320
with blue hair and safe spaces,

646
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,600
but it's also being pushed on innocent students by wicked professors.

647
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,720
Children must not be indoctrinated into gender ideology,

648
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,520
and so the government must make sure children believe

649
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,600
the things it says about gender,

650
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,240
but all of this is deeply confusing.

651
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,480
The Oxford English Dictionary defines gender ideology as...

652
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,760
Although gender ideology is a vague term,

653
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,200
there are recurring themes in how it is used.

654
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,560
One such theme is the idea that gender

655
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:29,840
is in some way unnatural or artificial or fake,

656
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:36,240
a contested belief, unlike biological sex and family values

657
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,600
which definitely are natural.

658
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:44,640
Another theme is that gender ideologues, whoever they are,

659
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,920
are powerful, commanding your obedience,

660
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,560
but also very sneaky, capturing institutions behind the scenes.

661
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,080
And the sneakiness is important,

662
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,040
because it allows the movement to claim gender ideologues

663
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,120
or doing all sorts of nefarious things

664
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,960
that they have no evidence for,

665
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,400
but the reason they have no evidence

666
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,080
is because they're so gosh darn sneaky.

667
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,480
Self-victimization plays a huge role here.

668
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,760
Another reason there's no evidence

669
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,480
is because ordinary people are being bullied

670
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,120
into silence by the woke genderists.

671
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:19,040
Sometimes this verges into outright conspiracy theory.

672
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,960
There are people in my country,

673
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,760
people with serious political and media careers,

674
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,720
who've claimed that our civil service and healthcare

675
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,160
are secretly being run by the trans deep state,

676
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,360
which frankly, I wish that were true.

677
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,800
The final theme is the danger

678
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,920
that gender ideology apparently poses.

679
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,400
Whatever it is, it's a threat to women who are erased

680
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,040
and to men who are made weak and helpless,

681
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,520
to families and to children in particular

682
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,080
who are confused or preyed upon.

683
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,280
It's a threat to the nation,

684
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,080
because you see gender makes us weak to communism,

685
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,240
or capitalism, or Vladimir Putin,

686
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,040
or Western influence, or Islamic migrants.

687
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,840
It's a threat to the existence of humanity

688
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:07,120
and the authority of God himself.

689
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,200
The Vatican has actually claimed that.

690
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,560
No exaggeration.

691
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:15,680
Pope Francis compared gender ideology to nuclear weapons.

692
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,120
It kind of just means the opposite of how things should be,

693
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,240
and the way they should be is whatever you personally want.

694
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,280
And that's a very effective strategy,

695
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,040
because it allows people who previously

696
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,000
might not have associated to stand together.

697
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,400
The movement features conservative Catholics,

698
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,920
men's rights activists, neo-Nazis, new age types,

699
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,880
centrists, liberals, and even some feminists.

700
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,120
And it's good at radicalizing them too.

701
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,400
Gender ideology seems like such a big threat.

702
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,280
It can't be stopped by traditional means.

703
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,200
We have to get tough.

704
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,960
Much of the blame for starting the anti-gender movement

705
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,760
belongs, I'm afraid, to Catholics.

706
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,240
Since the least the 1980s,

707
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,200
conservative Catholics, both within and without the church,

708
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,800
have said that gender ideology threatens the family and God.

709
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:10,400
They use this claim as justification for their extreme

710
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,680
authoritarian positions on abortion and queerness,

711
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,040
among other things.

712
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,640
It was Catholics who first started the conspiracy theory

713
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:23,760
that the UN are secretly pushing an anti-Christian gender agenda.

714
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:27,360
The Catholic Church has also claimed several times

715
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,760
in writing, without evidence,

716
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,360
that gender ideology leads to the abuse of children.

717
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,360
An IMAX level act of projection that might honestly be funny

718
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,680
if it weren't so insulting to the intelligence

719
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,320
of every human being on planet Earth.

720
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:48,080
Religion still plays a big role in driving anti-gender sentiment,

721
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,960
especially in the Americas and Eastern Europe.

722
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,680
In Britain, our version is a little more secular,

723
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,600
but that's not the case everywhere.

724
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,240
It's just, we don't go in for Catholicism

725
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,200
as much as we used to.

726
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:05,360
But it would be unfair to lay the blame on all Catholics.

727
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,520
Evangelicals are getting involved too,

728
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,960
and indeed, some ordinary Catholics might be getting scarred.

729
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,720
I have to be careful what I say here.

730
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,160
I can tell you that religion also plays a role

731
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,160
in how the movement is funded.

732
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,000
The Piotr Skarga Association, a Polish group

733
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,880
who oppose abortion and LGBTQ rights,

734
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,160
have raised millions of euros selling rosaries

735
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,600
and pictures of saints to Catholics around the world

736
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,720
via mail order.

737
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,360
And legally, I can't say that's a scam.

738
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,000
Maybe everyone who gives them money knows what they use it for.

739
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,520
Maybe when a little French grandma

740
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,400
in Toulouse buys a calendar with the Virgin Mary on it,

741
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,800
she knows full well that her money is going

742
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,880
to an extreme right-wing organization in Poland

743
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,960
who are going to send some of it to anti-abortion groups

744
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,360
in Brazil and spend the rest on luxury properties.

745
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,640
Grandma probably did her research.

746
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:07,120
And she'd have to, because their adverts don't mention it,

747
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,880
and Piotr Skarga's financial documents

748
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,800
were hidden from the public until journalists

749
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,640
broke this story in 2020.

750
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,880
Speaking of Catholic crimes, though,

751
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,400
the narrative is that gender ideology is being pushed

752
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,200
on the good people of the world by shadowy elites

753
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,480
who are pulling the strings.

754
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,280
And at this point in my reading, I was thinking,

755
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,280
well, that sounds a lot like anti-Semitism.

756
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:30,240
And yes, there are some parts of the movement

757
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,640
that are explicitly anti-Semitic.

758
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,240
For example, neo-Nazis have criticized Judith Butler

759
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,600
for being a Jewish lesbian who invented gender

760
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,120
to weaken the West.

761
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,880
But then I read this.

762
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,080
Anti-gender politics in the populist moment

763
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:49,280
by Polish scholars Agnieszka Graf and Albert Kolszuk.

764
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,760
They say not all anti-genderists are secretly anti-Semitic.

765
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,240
The reason they can look similar

766
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,640
is because they do similar things.

767
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:03,360
Objectify, make a certain group of people

768
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,280
impossible to listen to.

769
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:09,840
Though Jews are almost never mentioned in a text on gender ideology,

770
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,560
genderists and especially sexual minorities

771
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,840
are consistently Judaized in anti-gender discourse.

772
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,640
That is, described in a language strongly reminiscent

773
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,040
of conspiratorial anti-Semitism.

774
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,720
The link becomes most obvious when Soros and Butler are mentioned,

775
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,360
or when the term cultural Marxism,

776
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,240
notorious for its anti-Semitic subtext, is employed.

777
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,880
Like Jews and anti-Semitic attacks,

778
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,160
sexual minorities are presented as engaged in a secretive plot.

779
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,160
They are scheming, devious and powerful.

780
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,680
To this end, the term homosexual lobby is often used

781
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:47,200
and the link between homosexuality and cosmopolitanism

782
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,600
or rootlessness is persistently made.

783
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:55,200
Furthermore, LGBT activists are routinely accused of sacrilege.

784
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,880
Their very presence is said to contaminate sacred events and spaces,

785
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,040
while the rainbow flag is seen as offensive

786
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,240
to religious sensibilities and patriotic feelings.

787
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,920
Finally, like Jews and pre-World War II Eastern Europe,

788
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,560
gays are blamed for provoking violent attacks

789
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,640
by making themselves too conspicuous.

790
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,520
We're in the eye of the storm a lot.

791
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:20,960
I mean queer people generally, but sometimes us specifically.

792
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,600
Sometimes it feels like being under a big microscope.

793
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:32,160
Do you remember when we were studying theology at university?

794
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,160
Yeah, just about.

795
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,440
We had this one lecturer who taught us about Genesis.

796
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:45,040
Remember, he said, you are created.

797
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,520
You are a creature.

798
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,200
Yeah, I do remember that.

799
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,960
I didn't like that word creature.

800
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,960
Yeah, we belong to us.

801
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,680
We decide what we do.

802
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:02,240
Well, if it God does exist, it seems you've got notes.

803
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,600
That's all very interesting,

804
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:13,600
but it doesn't explain why the anti-gender movement just doesn't listen.

805
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,400
Remember back at the start when we learned about the school board

806
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,680
who turned down $10,000 of free money?

807
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,320
Remember how the same misunderstandings of Butler's work

808
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,000
have circulated for decades?

809
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,400
Remember the insistence that the law was made

810
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,200
that the law must have a strict definition of women,

811
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,880
even though we know that's not true?

812
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,880
Remember all those unevidence conspiracies

813
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,720
about the trans deep state and secret UN plots?

814
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,480
There's something else too that's very interesting.

815
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:45,120
The language that the anti-gender movement uses is very

816
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:52,720
actioning, threat, infiltration, danger, bullying, silencing, censorship,

817
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,560
a comparison to nuclear weapons.

818
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,560
It's not just that they're not listening.

819
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,800
When they're invited to listen,

820
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,080
it seems like that makes them feel as if they're under attack.

821
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,720
And Butler has an explanation for this.

822
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:10,320
They say that these people are caught in a phantasm.

823
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,240
Phantasm is a technical philosophy term

824
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,760
for a particular way of misinterpreting the world

825
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,560
by projecting your feelings onto it.

826
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,400
Philosopher Michael Nass says that it's a prism

827
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,080
that refracts an as-if into an as-so.

828
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,000
For example, the presence of a trans person

829
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,920
with a penis in a public bathroom

830
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:38,000
makes me feel as if I am under attack becomes...

831
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:43,200
I am under attack.

832
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,400
People use phantasms to avoid cognitive dissonance

833
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,160
in the face of anxiety.

834
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,360
For example, literature professor Darren Tenev

835
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:56,000
says we use them to help us confront death.

836
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,720
Normally, we don't want to think about our own deaths.

837
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,080
It makes us anxious.

838
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:02,560
So when we picture our own funerals

839
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,760
and what we would want to happen to our remains,

840
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,680
we imagine ourselves as being gone,

841
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,320
but also kind of still around.

842
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:13,360
Like, oh, I'd love to be buried somewhere that has a nice view.

843
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,160
Well, why?

844
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,400
You're not going to be there to enjoy it by definition.

845
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,760
That's a contradictory dream.

846
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,840
But the phantasm contains that contradiction

847
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,960
and soothes our anxiety.

848
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,600
It is as if I will still be there.

849
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,640
I will still be there.

850
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:37,360
What is characteristic of phantasms

851
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:38,800
is that they are placed

852
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,520
and place what could be called the subject of phantasm

853
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,480
on both sides of a border,

854
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,040
a boundary, a limit, a frontier.

855
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,440
When there is a border, a limitation,

856
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,040
the phantasm lets one on the other side

857
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,600
and not only provides a contraband access

858
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,560
through the border,

859
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:59,840
but also keeps one on both sides at the same time.

860
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:02,800
There is no logic of the phantasm.

861
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,560
The phantasm is phantasm

862
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:08,160
because it allows one to stand on both sides of a border,

863
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,280
for example,

864
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,160
allowing one to imagine one's own corpse

865
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,760
while still being alive.

866
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,960
Like he says, there's no logic to this.

867
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,960
It's an exercise in trying to not make sense

868
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,800
because you can't handle the conclusions

869
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,240
that you would reach if you did.

870
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,880
That's why people caught in a phantasm

871
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,320
will throw out all kinds of claims

872
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,720
that it doesn't really seem like they've thought through

873
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,400
or have any evidence for

874
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,840
and when questioned on it,

875
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,600
they'll say you're attacking me

876
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,320
because they're trying really hard

877
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:41,520
to not think something.

878
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,520
But what exactly?

879
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,800
What is the thing

880
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,960
that the anti-gender movement doesn't want to think?

881
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,680
Well, it'll probably be different

882
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,880
for different individuals.

883
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,880
J.K. Rowling has been massively radicalized

884
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,800
into the movement in the last few years.

885
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,400
She's made a lot of very weird

886
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,320
and false claims about trans people

887
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,720
and gotten very aggressive when challenged.

888
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,840
People have speculated about her trauma,

889
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:08,800
maybe causing that,

890
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,040
but as a woman who's also survived

891
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,000
an abusive relationship,

892
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,160
that kind of public speculation

893
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,240
has always felt a little bit gross to me.

894
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,840
I don't want to do armchair psychology on anyone,

895
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:21,600
even though I'm sure plenty of people

896
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:22,720
would love to do some on me.

897
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,320
It's just not the philosophy cheap way.

898
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:29,200
So maybe we can ask a more general version

899
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,400
of this same question.

900
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:33,520
Why are phantasms catching on?

901
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,440
And not just about this topic,

902
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,960
but all sorts of things.

903
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,080
On the previous episode,

904
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:41,040
we talked about 15-minute city conspiracy theories

905
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,040
and there's QAnon and conspiracies

906
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,480
about the royal family.

907
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,560
Sometimes the way that Zionists talk about

908
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,880
Palestinians has a touch of the phantasma about it,

909
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,280
as some Jewish scholars have noted.

910
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,440
This is a really big issue

911
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,040
and it would be great if we could sort

912
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,400
the whole gender thing out

913
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,280
because we've got a lot of real problems to deal with.

914
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,840
We don't have time to be fighting imaginary ones.

915
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:08,640
Oh, Graf and Korolchuk say

916
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,680
there really are a lot of problems in the world.

917
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,160
And a lot of them are systemic.

918
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,560
A lot of women really are devalued.

919
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,080
A lot of children really are living

920
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,800
in an increasingly dangerous and warming world.

921
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,120
A lot of people really do rely on their families

922
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,040
to protect them from big institutions

923
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,240
and economic forces

924
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,400
that really will trample every tradition

925
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,600
and really do dissolve everything into money.

926
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,480
According to them, the anti-gender phantasm

927
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:38,160
is an attempt to criticize the effects of capitalism

928
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,160
without naming capitalism as the problem.

929
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,360
People see the bad results of the system that we have,

930
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,160
but they're invested in those same systems

931
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,360
and so the solutions become unthinkable.

932
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,600
Their criticisms have to be expressed

933
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:56,800
as a kind of moral criticism.

934
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:01,200
Anti-genderism is the socialism of fools

935
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,680
and the feminism of fools

936
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,280
and the anti-colonialism of fools.

937
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,280
The anti-gender movement is so effective

938
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,480
in attracting mass support

939
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,400
because it is structured and legitimized

940
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,680
as a conservative response to the excesses of neoliberalism.

941
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,000
A crucial source of anxiety

942
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,280
is the rampant individualism of contemporary culture,

943
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,560
the erosion of community

944
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,480
and growing instability of everyday life.

945
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,880
Opponents of gender ideology

946
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,440
attribute these trends to the influence of feminism

947
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,640
and the sexual revolution.

948
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,200
Anti-genderism conflates gender

949
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,040
with those aspects of capitalism

950
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,400
that are most frustrating

951
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,800
to members of the working and lower middle class,

952
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,960
especially to parents and would-be parents,

953
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,880
precarity and the crisis of care

954
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,120
resulting from unequal distribution of wealth.

955
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,640
Instead of naming the problem in economic terms

956
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,120
as injustice and exploitation,

957
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:54,240
anti-genderism presents the world of capitalism's winners

958
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:57,120
as degenerate and morally corrupt.

959
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:00,080
And here's where we tie it all together

960
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:04,000
and bring it back to Judith Butler.

961
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:08,240
When the anti-gender movement say that gender is an ideology

962
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,320
and sex is a fixed point,

963
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:13,760
we now understand they aren't making an observation,

964
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,680
they're making a demand.

965
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,280
When they say that you can't change sex,

966
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,640
they mean you shouldn't be allowed to

967
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,720
because that would be dangerous,

968
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,680
not the kind of danger that is proven with evidence,

969
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:32,160
but the kind they want the state to posit and punish.

970
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:35,360
What they want is morally righteous violence

971
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,520
that restores an imaginary order

972
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,920
because they are anxious about real problems

973
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,720
that they cannot or will not think about,

974
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,200
and so they can only glimpse those problems

975
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:50,400
through the prism of unreality.

976
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,920
The contradictory character of the phantasm

977
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,640
allows it to contain whatever anxiety or fear

978
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,200
that the anti-gender ideology wishes to stoke

979
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,400
for its own purposes,

980
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,960
without having to make any of it cohere.

981
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,560
Depending on the anxieties circulating in a particular region,

982
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:09,360
gender can be figured as Marxist or capitalist,

983
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:13,200
tyranny or libertarianism, fascism or totalitarianism,

984
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,400
a totalizing force, or an unwanted migrant.

985
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,360
It is not that people are unmindful of the contradiction

986
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,880
and need to be enlightened.

987
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,760
No, the contradiction itself is what works,

988
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,080
in effect emancipating people from the task

989
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:28,000
of developing a rational position.

990
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:34,000
Maybe it's because I'm older,

991
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,320
but part of the reason I came back is to tell you

992
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,920
life is too short to spend it being miserable.

993
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:44,960
Actually, that's the point.

994
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,000
How come you look younger than me?

995
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:50,560
Because I'm happier.

996
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:52,960
Joy is youthful.

997
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:55,920
Also, we get a really good skincare routine.

998
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,240
I don't want to think about getting older.

999
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:01,520
You know mom's fish pie recipe?

1000
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:04,080
Yeah.

1001
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:06,000
There's this really amazing moment that's going to happen

1002
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,200
when you're 30.

1003
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,080
You make that fish pie for a friend who's like 23,

1004
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:11,680
and you bring it out and she says,

1005
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,200
you are literally my mother.

1006
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,840
And that is going to be one of the first times

1007
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,440
you realize that we're getting older.

1008
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,880
But it's actually nice because it's like,

1009
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,720
we have a knowledge that younger people don't.

1010
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,440
And it's not like a superiority thing.

1011
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,360
It's that we get to be helpful.

1012
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:32,720
We become an auntie.

1013
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,280
We have little nieces and a nephew.

1014
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,880
We help them put on their shoes

1015
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,200
and they ask us to tell them about Shakespeare.

1016
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:50,240
I wish I could tell you that it's all going to be moments like that.

1017
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:52,960
But you're right.

1018
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,320
Your future has ups and downs.

1019
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:57,680
And it's mainly ups.

1020
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,400
But the politics is big down.

1021
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,440
Does it get better?

1022
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,360
Let's talk about Brainworms.

1023
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,680
Brainworms is a 2024 novel by Alison Rumford

1024
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,400
about a woman who discovers that several high-ranking British politicians

1025
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,480
and journalists are being secretly controlled

1026
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,120
by a contagious parasite that makes them bigoted.

1027
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:24,960
She has to uncover the conspiracy,

1028
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,000
but nobody will believe her.

1029
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,400
Because she's working class and trans.

1030
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,480
And maybe imagining it.

1031
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:34,560
I like that the worms are never confirmed to be real.

1032
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:38,000
We could read them as hallucinations.

1033
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:42,080
That ambiguity forces us to engage only with the metaphor.

1034
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,080
Brainworms might not be real,

1035
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:51,680
but hate is infectious, disgusting, and perverse.

1036
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,920
One character is a famous author

1037
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,400
who writes books about teenage witches.

1038
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,920
There's a scene where she infects someone else,

1039
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:05,760
coming close to her victim, worms dripping from her open mouth.

1040
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,200
And she says a line.

1041
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,440
And in the movie version, this would be the line

1042
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:12,240
that reveals a glimpse of her evil plan, right?

1043
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,080
But instead, she says,

1044
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,600
I've seen the future of this country.

1045
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:23,360
And it's going to get so much worse.

1046
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,320
The worms don't make her happy.

1047
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,320
In fact, they're a kind of contagious misery.

1048
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:32,960
Nobody who is infected ever gets better.

1049
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:38,400
So what can we do about all of the things that we have learned today?

1050
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,960
Well, there's actually two questions rolled into one there.

1051
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,600
The first is, what can we practically do

1052
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,920
about the political situation that we're all living in?

1053
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,560
And secondly, can we convince people

1054
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:51,120
who are stuck inside phantasms?

1055
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:55,680
So first things first, practically speaking, what can we do?

1056
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,920
Well, if you've been watching this show for any amount of time,

1057
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,560
you know that I hate telling people what to do or think.

1058
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:04,240
But here's some suggestions, maybe.

1059
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:07,920
If you're Catholic and you like buying little medals

1060
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,440
or rosaries or chuchkies, if you have relatives who do,

1061
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:12,960
maybe older relatives who do,

1062
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:16,960
you might like to double check where that money is going.

1063
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,560
If you happen to work in media,

1064
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:23,600
that all of this theory could have some practical applications for you,

1065
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:25,840
we might like to talk about anti-genderists

1066
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:29,120
the same way we talk about anti-vaxxers or climate deniers.

1067
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:33,200
For example, Mrs. X says this, which is false.

1068
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,800
Organization Y claims this, which is pseudoscience.

1069
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,800
Another thing that you might like to try

1070
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:41,680
is using the word cisgender.

1071
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,200
It was coined in the early 90s.

1072
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,520
It means not transgender.

1073
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:48,640
And the English language anti-gender movement hate it

1074
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:52,160
because it implies that trans people and cis people

1075
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,720
are both worth listening to.

1076
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:59,520
It resists objectification by putting us on an even playing field.

1077
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:02,720
Kind of like using the word straight or heterosexual

1078
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,320
instead of saying normal.

1079
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:08,400
Beyond that, Graf and Karl Schuch say we need to appreciate the fact

1080
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:12,320
that right-wing populism is criticizing capitalism,

1081
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,640
albeit in phantasmic terms.

1082
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,720
They say we should move beyond the old idea

1083
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,320
that the left are anti-capitalist

1084
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:20,720
and the right are always pro-market.

1085
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:23,200
Now some of them are, to be sure, but not all.

1086
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,440
They say that these days a lot of people on the right

1087
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,440
are actually criticizing capitalism

1088
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:30,080
even if they don't use that kind of language.

1089
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:33,040
And so sticking to the same old economic policies

1090
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,480
we've had for the last 40 years

1091
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:38,560
is leaving yourself wide open to those far right extremists.

1092
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:42,320
They also say that LGBTQ stuff and gender stuff

1093
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:45,600
can't really be separated from normal politics anymore

1094
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,400
because that's how a lot of people are engaging

1095
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,800
with normal politics these days.

1096
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:53,360
The anti-gender phantasm isn't the only thing

1097
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:55,520
powering the global right, to be sure,

1098
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,520
but it's big enough that it can't be ignored.

1099
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:01,360
Important lessons there for centrists, perhaps.

1100
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:05,040
They recommend a strategy called populist feminism

1101
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:08,800
which involves tapping into people's emotions in the moment.

1102
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:11,120
An example from the UK might be the group

1103
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:13,520
Sisters Uncut who've been very successful

1104
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:17,200
mobilizing a broad coalition against austerity,

1105
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:20,160
domestic violence cuts, police violence,

1106
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,760
prisons, health care segregation,

1107
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,280
arms sales to the Israeli government,

1108
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:24,720
and many other things

1109
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:27,040
because they recognize that all those forces

1110
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:29,200
disproportionately hurt women

1111
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:32,720
and therefore women can be brought together

1112
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:34,480
to protest against them

1113
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:37,600
if given the chance to express our feelings

1114
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:40,160
of hurt and righteous anger.

1115
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:42,320
There's many ways to be involved in a group like that

1116
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,160
from actually taking Barton demonstrations

1117
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,280
to donating money

1118
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:48,320
which again empowers a broad coalition.

1119
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:50,960
A broad coalition, a coalition of broads,

1120
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:54,240
dames, dime pieces, chicks, dolls, all standing together.

1121
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:55,920
Will it work?

1122
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,240
Well, join me at the end of the 21st century

1123
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:02,080
to see humanity's final scores.

1124
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:04,480
And now our second question.

1125
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:08,800
Can we reach people stuck in phantasms?

1126
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:11,280
Is there a cure for brainworns?

1127
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:18,800
Well, to be honest,

1128
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,880
there's somebody who does a lot of public education.

1129
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:21,920
I really hate to admit this,

1130
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:25,520
but I am not optimistic that education will work.

1131
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,040
Butler says that this movement

1132
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:32,000
is not only irrational but anti-rational.

1133
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Many of the most prominent people in it

1134
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,080
proudly do not engage

1135
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:38,320
with any of the academic material on gender.

1136
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,280
At the end of my research journey,

1137
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:44,080
I realized the reason they don't listen

1138
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,560
is because they feel that listening

1139
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:47,840
is an act of submission.

1140
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:55,280
And I can't help it.

1141
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:56,400
I think that's really sad.

1142
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:58,560
I really don't want to come across

1143
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:02,240
as like patronizing or giving people

1144
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,320
with mercy that they wouldn't give me,

1145
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:06,960
but I think it is really sad

1146
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:10,400
when people refuse their own complexity,

1147
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:11,840
when they refuse to become

1148
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,160
the person that they might become

1149
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:15,200
if they just listened.

1150
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:20,560
Indeed, there could be no greater enemy

1151
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:23,920
for philosophy tube than the anti-gender phantasm.

1152
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:27,360
This show is about compassion and reason

1153
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:30,480
and sharing knowledge between equals.

1154
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,440
It's born out of my belief that

1155
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:41,360
thinking and research and words and writing

1156
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:44,160
that they matter.

1157
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,160
And I'm trans.

1158
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:53,840
This is my final boss fight.

1159
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:58,400
Informed public debate becomes impossible

1160
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,320
when some parties refuse to read

1161
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:02,320
the material under dispute.

1162
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,320
It is nearly impossible to breach

1163
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:07,120
this epistemic divide with good arguments

1164
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:08,560
because of the fear that reading

1165
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:11,760
will introduce confusion into the reader's mind

1166
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,720
or bring her into direct contact with the devil.

1167
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:17,040
They're skeptical of the academy

1168
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:19,200
for fear that intellectual debates

1169
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:22,160
may well confuse them about the values they hold.

1170
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:25,920
They're refusal to care much about consistency,

1171
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:28,960
to base their criticisms on a reading of the text,

1172
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,640
their way of snatching phrases

1173
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:32,240
and making them into lightning rods.

1174
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:36,880
However, are all finally a refusal to think critically.

1175
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:43,920
Some individual people do get better.

1176
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:47,840
When we first come out,

1177
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,560
there's going to be people who do not take it well.

1178
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:56,000
But in time, they see that we are happier

1179
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,360
and for most of them, that's enough.

1180
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:04,000
I'm scared of changing.

1181
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:06,480
No offence.

1182
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:10,240
Yeah, well, you will change.

1183
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:14,160
But you keep the good bits.

1184
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:21,360
Are you still making philosophy tube in the future?

1185
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:23,600
What did the audience say?

1186
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:26,720
They brought them with me.

1187
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:33,600
Oh, hi.

1188
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:36,640
Nice to see you all.

1189
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:40,320
There's more of them.

1190
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:42,320
A lot more.

1191
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:58,960
I love you.

1192
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:02,640
I love you too.

1193
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:26,400
I'd like to end by telling you my hopes for the future.

1194
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:29,200
I hope that I will grow old.

1195
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:32,080
I hope that when I am old,

1196
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:34,880
I will still be cooking the way that my mom taught me

1197
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:37,520
and that I will have the wisdom of my dad.

1198
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:42,160
I hope that my nieces and my nephew grow up into good

1199
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:43,200
and happy people.

1200
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:46,640
I hope that I will see younger people

1201
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:48,240
have opportunities that I didn't.

1202
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:51,120
And I hope that I won't be too jealous.

1203
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:55,440
I hope that I will be acting and making art

1204
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:57,040
for the rest of my life.

1205
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:02,640
I hope that this is not the cleverest

1206
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:05,040
or the most compassionate that I will ever be,

1207
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:08,240
but that I will continue to change.

1208
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:15,200
Because the only people who don't change are the dead.

1209
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:26,400
Speaking of changes,

1210
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:31,280
I've been doing philosophy tube for 11 years now.

1211
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:34,400
Some of you have been here that whole time.

1212
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:35,680
And I don't know if you realize it,

1213
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:39,360
but you have changed my life.

1214
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:42,560
Off YouTube, I'm a professional actor.

1215
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:45,200
YouTube kind of blew up first,

1216
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:48,000
but it's always been separate from my acting career.

1217
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:51,280
Until I wrote a play called The Prince,

1218
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:54,960
which a lot of you came to see, so it did really well.

1219
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:57,680
And then I got cast in Baldur's Gate 3.

1220
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:01,280
And then I got cast in Star Wars.

1221
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,800
And then I got cast in something that's even bigger than Star Wars

1222
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:06,160
that I'm not allowed to tell you about yet.

1223
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:11,040
And the engine of all of this has been you.

1224
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:14,080
I used to think that I would probably have to leave YouTube behind

1225
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:15,760
someday to focus on acting,

1226
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:20,560
but now I realize that because of you and your lovely enthusiasm

1227
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:22,960
for all of the things that I make and that I'm in,

1228
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:28,560
I now realize we can combine YouTube and acting

1229
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:32,560
into something more powerful than either one can be alone.

1230
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:36,320
So then I was like, okay, I want to write a short film.

1231
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:37,680
And I did.

1232
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:40,240
It's called Dracula's Ex-Girlfriend.

1233
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:44,000
It's about two vampire chicks in LA being horrible to each other.

1234
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,880
I pitched it to a streaming service called Nebula.

1235
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:51,600
I said, hey, I've got this big audience and we already had success with my play.

1236
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,440
Do you maybe want to do a movie?

1237
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:54,480
And they said, yes.

1238
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:58,480
Once again, you have changed my life.

1239
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:01,120
Do you know how many actors would kill to have a streaming service

1240
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:02,880
pick up their debut film?

1241
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,000
I'm going to be in it too.

1242
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:09,040
My co-stars are Morgana Ignis and Brandon Rogers from Hell of a Boss,

1243
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:11,760
one of the biggest shows in the world.

1244
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:15,280
And you will be able to see the film when it comes out

1245
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:19,600
at go.nebula.tv slash dex.

1246
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:24,080
And it gets better because Nebula isn't just another streaming service.

1247
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:26,640
Imagine that you had a role in a show on Disney Plus.

1248
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:29,200
Say, I don't know, Star Wars the Acolyte?

1249
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:32,240
Well, you do the job and you have a great time.

1250
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:34,080
And at the end of the day, you go home.

1251
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:36,240
Star Wars belongs to Disney.

1252
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:41,600
But on Nebula, the people who create the thing own the thing.

1253
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,600
I wrote Dracula's ex-girlfriend, so I keep the rights.

1254
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:50,480
They're giving the creators more power and even better.

1255
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:52,480
If you all go and get Disney Plus to watch Star Wars,

1256
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:53,360
then that's really cool.

1257
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:56,640
But the creators of the show don't get like a bonus or anything.

1258
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:00,800
However, if you get Nebula using that link specifically,

1259
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:04,880
then I get a cut and you get a discount.

1260
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:08,000
$2.50 a month with an annual subscription.

1261
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,200
So I help you.

1262
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:10,640
You're helping me.

1263
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:13,040
We are helping each other.

1264
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:14,800
And there's even more.

1265
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,760
If you want to see the full scene that we shot for this episode,

1266
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:21,280
without all the video essay bits in between, that's on Nebula too.

1267
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:25,120
Every episode of Philosophy Tube goes up there early and uncensored.

1268
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:26,320
Lindsay Ellis is on there.

1269
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:27,680
Legal Eagle's on there.

1270
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:29,040
H-Bomber Guy's on there.

1271
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:31,120
They're making a whole bunch of documentaries now.

1272
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:33,920
They're making a sci-fi movie directed by Jesse Gender

1273
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,040
that I'm going to be in.

1274
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:36,240
It's called Identities.

1275
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:37,440
It comes out in June.

1276
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:40,800
If you get Nebula, you can see all of that.

1277
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:43,840
We are combining YouTube and acting.

1278
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:46,400
And we are unlocking the power.

1279
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:49,680
You and I have had a lot of fun over these last 11 years.

1280
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:53,040
The next step is Dracula's ex-girlfriend.

1281
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:58,560
And after that, wait and see.

1282
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:24,320
She's the type who will get what she wants, doesn't hide.

1283
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:31,360
Always hiding the sun and it kills me slowly.

1284
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:39,920
Seeing her pass me by in the city of dreams.

1285
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:44,480
Wish that I had the power in me.

1286
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:52,240
But I'm just too madly insecure.

1287
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:58,480
All the time that I waste and always looking

1288
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:04,240
at strangers thinking there's so much better than me.

1289
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:09,760
All the time that I wait is they don't make it some changes.

1290
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:12,720
It's crazy.

1291
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:15,280
Who's that girl?

1292
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:19,920
She walks around like she could rule the world.

1293
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:25,040
She goes for everything that she deserves.

1294
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:29,600
Say what would it take for me to be like her?

1295
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:34,160
I want it out.

1296
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:38,720
I want it out.

1297
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:42,160
Because I just want to be somebody.

1298
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:44,160
Not just anybody.

1299
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:46,160
Tell me who's that?

1300
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:47,600
Who's that?

1301
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:48,560
Who's that?

1302
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:53,120
In your eyes, there's a sense of belief.

1303
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:55,600
I just cry.

1304
01:12:55,600 --> 01:13:02,560
I'm a pretty party and I'm getting nowhere.

1305
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:14,000
When she comes first, how can I get some confidence with my mind?

1306
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Never wants to be friends.

1307
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:26,000
It just keeps comparing me to her.

1308
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,480
Who's that girl?

1309
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:33,040
She walks around like she could rule the world.

1310
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:38,240
She goes for everything that she deserves.

1311
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:42,800
Say what would it take for me to be like her?

1312
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:46,720
I want to know who's that girl.

1313
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:51,280
She's got a power like we're all here.

1314
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:56,480
I bet she's got to make me wait when it works.

1315
01:13:56,480 --> 01:14:01,040
Say what would it take for me to be like her?

1316
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:05,600
I want it out.

1317
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:10,240
I want it out.

1318
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:13,680
Because I just want to be somebody.

1319
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:15,680
Not just anybody.

1320
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:17,680
Tell me who's that?

1321
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:19,680
Who's that?

1322
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:23,680
Who's that girl?

1323
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:27,680
Who's that girl?

1324
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:31,680
Because I just want to be somebody.

1325
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:33,680
Not just anybody.

1326
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:35,680
Tell me who's that?

1327
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:37,680
Who's that?

1328
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:39,920
Who's that girl?

1329
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,920
You can moonwalk and live your talent.

1330
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,920
Apparently.

1331
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,920
That's it, that's the end of the video.

1332
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:00,160
I'm just kidding.
