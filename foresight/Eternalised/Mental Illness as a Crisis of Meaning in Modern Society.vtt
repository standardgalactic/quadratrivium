00:00.000 --> 00:08.400
Modern society is characterized by many things, but perhaps most notably by the remarkable scientific and technological advancement,

00:08.400 --> 00:12.160
as well as capitalism, individualism and hedonism.

00:12.160 --> 00:17.280
We are wealthier than our ancestors, we live in more safe and comfortable environments,

00:17.280 --> 00:20.080
we have more access to food and other basic needs.

00:20.080 --> 00:24.480
Why then have we seen a massive spike in mental illness?

00:24.480 --> 00:32.160
The bulk of evidence concludes that there seems to have been a significant rise in the incidence of lunacy in the 19th century,

00:32.160 --> 00:38.160
and that this increase consisted largely of patients with the illness we now call schizophrenia.

00:38.160 --> 00:45.680
One of the most widely ramifying features of modernity is the intense focus on the value and power of the individual self,

00:45.680 --> 00:53.280
to turn away from the search of an objective external order and to instead turn inward and become aware of our own activity.

00:53.360 --> 00:59.120
This becomes a pervasive feature of human experience and self-knowledge in the 19th century,

00:59.120 --> 01:04.160
Western cultures dominated by individualism, subjectivism and relativism,

01:04.160 --> 01:09.520
with the rise of a new character type that dominates our age, the psychological man,

01:09.520 --> 01:12.720
who is intent upon the conquest of his inner life.

01:12.720 --> 01:17.280
Mental illness must also be viewed in line with a modern social structure,

01:17.280 --> 01:26.400
with bureaucratization, technologization, secularization and rationalization of the modern world on the level of individual experience.

01:26.400 --> 01:31.040
The conditions of modern life, with its rational forms of social organization,

01:31.040 --> 01:37.120
are more complex, conflicting and require potentially disorienting cognitive requirements.

01:37.120 --> 01:44.640
While there is an emphasis on individuality, one must also simultaneously adapt to society's evolving needs.

01:44.720 --> 01:50.240
The problem arises when these two are in contradiction, leading to a sense of inner division.

01:50.240 --> 01:56.560
In the myth of mental illness, psychiatrist Thomas Sass criticizes the psychiatric establishment,

01:56.560 --> 02:03.760
who uses mental illness as a metaphor to describe an offending or disturbing pattern of behavior,

02:03.760 --> 02:09.280
under the wide-ranging term schizophrenia, as an illness or disease, Sass wrote,

02:09.280 --> 02:14.320
If you talk to God, you are praying. If God talks to you, you have schizophrenia.

02:14.320 --> 02:20.320
If the dead talk to you, you are a spiritualist. If you talk to the dead, you are a schizophrenic.

02:20.320 --> 02:25.920
While many behave and think in disturbing ways, this does not mean they actually have a disease.

02:25.920 --> 02:33.680
Unlike physical illness and disease, mental illness is judged from certain psychosocial, ethical or legal norms.

02:33.680 --> 02:36.720
Transgressing these is not a consequence of illness,

02:36.720 --> 02:40.960
but of the attempt to confront and tackle the problems in living.

02:40.960 --> 02:46.240
Sass does not suggest that mental illnesses do not exist. Rather, he's claiming that many such

02:46.240 --> 02:52.000
phenomena is a consequence of the attempt to confront and tackle the problem of how to live,

02:52.000 --> 02:58.880
and to identify such phenomena as a disease or an illness, is to hide the very real problems in

02:58.880 --> 03:04.000
living that people face. With increasing understanding of himself and of the world,

03:04.000 --> 03:09.520
modern man feels that he's free to direct his own life and must take responsibility for it.

03:09.520 --> 03:15.600
We are, as Jean-Paul Sartre asserted, condemned to be free, condemned to shoulder the burden of our

03:15.600 --> 03:21.760
freedom and responsibility without being able to seek refuge in others. We must be responsible

03:21.760 --> 03:27.040
for ourselves, for we have no other way of experiencing ourselves or the world as being in

03:27.040 --> 03:32.480
any other mode than our own existence. We cannot have our existence depend on somebody else,

03:32.480 --> 03:37.440
for that would contradict the very core of our being. We can ask for other people's opinions,

03:37.440 --> 03:44.480
but the choice ultimately lies in us. Many cannot stand this desing freedom. Kierkegaard says that

03:44.480 --> 03:49.920
one can either get lost in the infinite, a state of analysis paralysis where one thinks of the

03:49.920 --> 03:55.360
infinite possibilities but never acts, or get lost in the finite, becoming an imitation,

03:55.360 --> 04:01.600
a number, a scythe in the crowd. The latter is a finitude to spare, or what we would now call

04:01.600 --> 04:07.360
depressive psychosis. One cannot imagine any alternate ways of life and release himself

04:07.360 --> 04:13.520
from the trivial obligations that give him no value. It is as if one has literally died to life,

04:13.520 --> 04:19.600
but must remain physically in this world. One lives dyingly. Eventually, one faces the Y of

04:19.600 --> 04:25.920
existence, as Albert Camus writes, rising, streetcar, four hours in the office or factory,

04:25.920 --> 04:32.400
meal, streetcar, four hours of work, meal, sleep, and Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,

04:32.400 --> 04:38.400
Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, according to the same rhythm. This path is easily followed most

04:38.400 --> 04:44.720
of the time, but one day the Y arises, and everything begins in that weariness tinged with

04:44.720 --> 04:51.520
amazement. Camus' absurd person is one who is seen through the ridiculous repetitions of daily life.

04:51.520 --> 04:57.600
He is conscious of his Sisyphian condemnation. We all have to push our own boulders and watch it

04:57.600 --> 05:03.520
roll back down. If what we do does not satisfy our Y of existence, we must search for other

05:03.520 --> 05:10.320
alternatives, or risk falling into an existential crisis, a nauseating sensation of trying to justify

05:10.320 --> 05:16.880
one's existence, which can lead to suicide. One of Western civilization's most significant events

05:16.880 --> 05:23.200
is the Age of Enlightenment in the 18th century, a period which undermined the values that society

05:23.200 --> 05:30.080
had hitherto relied on, namely on the religious view. This engenders the most profound cultural,

05:30.080 --> 05:36.160
sociological, and psychological repercussions, leaving many facing a crisis in discerning a

05:36.160 --> 05:40.960
meaning or purpose for their existence, and struggling to tackle the problems in living

05:40.960 --> 05:46.320
that this gives rise to. While we previously had ready answers to the problem of how life

05:46.400 --> 05:51.920
ought to be lived and what its overall meaning and purpose was, since faith in the existence of God

05:51.920 --> 05:57.680
gave us the reassurance that we are partaking in a divine project, we are now slowly experiencing

05:57.680 --> 06:03.600
the consequences of what Nietzsche proclaimed as the death of God, whose full consequences would

06:03.600 --> 06:10.240
elude many people as he made clear. This tremendous event is still on its way, still wondering,

06:10.240 --> 06:15.680
it has not yet reached the ears of men. This deed is still more distant from them than the

06:15.680 --> 06:21.680
most distant stars, and yet they have done it themselves. This realization forces us to be

06:21.680 --> 06:27.920
faced with the terrifying question, has existence any meaning at all? The modern age is characterized

06:27.920 --> 06:34.560
by a sense of disorientation, of not knowing what to do with one's life. One notable figure who

06:34.560 --> 06:40.320
has attempted to respond to this existential crisis, and the psychological manifestations of

06:40.320 --> 06:46.480
meaninglessness is Viktor Frankl, who had been left in an existential vacuum. The meaning crisis

06:46.480 --> 06:52.720
and mass neurosis of modern times is the unheard cry for meaning. Frankl believes this is the

06:52.720 --> 06:58.640
cause of much of modernity's increase in mental illness, it is the struggle to confront the

06:58.640 --> 07:05.360
existential vacuum. He writes, such widespread phenomena as depression, aggression and addiction

07:05.360 --> 07:11.680
are not understandable unless we recognize the existential vacuum underlying them. Frankl's

07:11.680 --> 07:18.000
therapeutic response to those experiencing such phenomena is to reorient the person to the meaning

07:18.000 --> 07:23.040
or the purpose of their existence, to confront the question of the meaning of their existence,

07:23.040 --> 07:29.520
to explore the question and ultimately to provide a positive answer to it. Finding meaning to one's

07:29.520 --> 07:35.360
life is not to be understood as some idle or academic curiosity that one engages in when more

07:35.360 --> 07:41.360
fundamental needs have been met. The striving to search for and to possess a meaning or a purpose

07:41.360 --> 07:46.960
for one's life is said to be the primary motivational force in man. Without a meaning,

07:46.960 --> 07:53.600
all of life's struggles, strivings and projects become ultimately futile. Frankl believes that

07:53.600 --> 07:59.920
this sense of futility is what characterizes addiction, aggression and depression. There is

07:59.920 --> 08:06.000
nothing in the world that would so effectively help one to survive even the worst conditions as the

08:06.000 --> 08:12.320
knowledge that there is a meaning in one's life. Frankl concludes, in a word, each man is questioned

08:12.320 --> 08:19.520
by life and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life. To life he can only respond by

08:19.520 --> 08:25.920
being responsible. Modern man is in desperate need for the hero journey. In Man and His Symbols,

08:25.920 --> 08:32.240
Union psychologist Joseph Anderson describes the importance of the hero myth as a universal pattern

08:32.240 --> 08:37.920
throughout the world. The hero descends into darkness to slay a dragon, rescue a damsel in

08:37.920 --> 08:44.000
distress and gather the treasure. The early weakness of the hero is balanced by the appearance of

08:44.080 --> 08:49.920
strong guardians who enable him to perform the tasks that he cannot accomplish unaided.

08:49.920 --> 08:55.520
Their role is the development of one's strengths and weaknesses in a manner that will equip one

08:55.520 --> 09:01.760
for the arduous tasks which life confronts him. This can be linked to being dependent on one's

09:01.760 --> 09:07.920
parents. It is only when one becomes independent and confronts the world by himself that the individual

09:07.920 --> 09:15.200
has passed his initial test and can enter the mature phase of life. In Memories, Dreams, Reflections,

09:15.200 --> 09:20.800
Carl Jung's research brought him into the burning question what actually takes place inside the

09:20.800 --> 09:27.200
mentally ill. He writes, to my mind, therapy only really begins after the investigation of that

09:27.200 --> 09:33.600
holy personal story. It is the patient's secret, the rugged games which he is shattered. If I know

09:33.600 --> 09:39.840
his secret story, I have a key to the treatment. In most cases, exploration of the conscious material

09:39.840 --> 09:46.560
is insufficient. In therapy, the problem is always the whole person, never the symptom alone. We must

09:46.560 --> 09:53.200
ask questions which challenge the whole personality. Jung treated many schizophrenic patients who were

09:53.200 --> 09:59.280
considered a last cause. The paradox of schizophrenia is that there is both a dissolution of the self in

09:59.280 --> 10:06.000
the world but also the dissolution of the world in the self. Eternal punishment but divine omnipotence.

10:06.000 --> 10:11.440
The patient doubts that it is really him who is thinking his thoughts. Reality might as well be a

10:11.440 --> 10:18.480
train of illusions produced in him by evil scientists. It is the most profound form of self-contradiction

10:18.480 --> 10:26.240
to be both God and a worm. Jung, however, found out that many people who were diagnosed with schizophrenia

10:26.240 --> 10:32.160
actually had ordinary depression as a result of traumas and difficult life experiences that had

10:32.160 --> 10:38.480
been repressed. He tells the story of an 18-year-old girl who had been abused at the age of 15.

10:38.480 --> 10:44.960
She retreated into isolation and concealed herself from people. She was taken to a mental hospital

10:44.960 --> 10:50.880
and remained in a catatonic state. Over the course of many weeks, Jung gradually persuaded her to

10:51.440 --> 10:56.800
After overcoming many resistances, she told Jung that she had been living on the moon. She said

10:56.800 --> 11:02.560
that she did not like this world and that the moon was beautiful and life there was rich in meaning.

11:02.560 --> 11:09.040
He writes, as a result of the incest to which she had been subjected as a girl, she felt humiliated

11:09.040 --> 11:14.480
in the eyes of the world but elevated in the realm of fantasy. The consequence was complete

11:14.480 --> 11:20.640
alienation from the world, a state of psychosis. She became extra mundane as it were and lost

11:20.640 --> 11:26.640
contact with humanity. She plunged into cosmic distances into outer space where she met with

11:26.640 --> 11:33.120
a winged demon. By telling me her story, she had in a sense betrayed the demon and attached herself

11:33.120 --> 11:39.120
to an earthly human being. Thereafter, I regarded the sufferings of the mentally ill in a different

11:39.120 --> 11:44.960
light for I had gained insight into the richness and importance of the inner experiences.

11:45.600 --> 11:51.040
In his book Tribe, Sebastian Jung argues that throughout history, humans have had a strong

11:51.040 --> 11:57.360
instinct to belong to small groups or tribes. These tribes gave people a purpose and understanding

11:57.360 --> 12:04.560
of life. However, this tribal connection has been obliterated in modern society. During wars with

12:04.560 --> 12:10.400
the Indian tribes, many European settlers were taken as prisoners and held within the tribes.

12:10.400 --> 12:16.720
After they had a chance to escape and return to their modern society, many refused to do so. They

12:16.720 --> 12:23.200
preferred the Primitive Society over their modern one. On the contrary, not one tribesman wanted

12:23.200 --> 12:29.600
to flee to modern society. We have evolved genetically to live in an interdependent group

12:29.600 --> 12:35.680
in order to survive, and this creates equality as everyone plays a necessary role in the tribe.

12:35.680 --> 12:42.000
They work 12 hours a week to survive in contrast to the average 40 hours a week that many westernized

12:42.000 --> 12:48.000
societies require. The tribes collaborate for survival. Each day they go to hunt and gather,

12:48.000 --> 12:53.760
and in the evening they return to share the food. People often believe that modern life with all

12:53.840 --> 12:59.600
its efficient technology has allowed for more leisure time. However, the exact opposite is true.

12:59.600 --> 13:05.520
Modern life is characterized by a desperate cycle of work, financial obligation, and more work,

13:05.520 --> 13:11.520
sacrificing personal freedom. One might argue, however, that modernity has allowed for a sense

13:11.520 --> 13:17.360
of independence, which primitive man could never have achieved, leading to a sense of freedom,

13:17.360 --> 13:23.760
but can also lead to a feeling of alienation and depression. We have not yet been genetically

13:23.760 --> 13:30.000
adapted to our environment. The enormous changes of agriculture and the industrial revolution have

13:30.000 --> 13:35.840
hardly begun to affect our gene pool. In other words, even though we live in more complex societies,

13:35.840 --> 13:42.080
we are still hardwired to be hunter-gatherers. Today we can be surrounded by a group of people

13:42.080 --> 13:47.920
and yet feel completely alone. This is not something we have experienced until quite recently.

13:47.920 --> 13:54.000
We are wired to belong to a group where we feel valued by our contributions to it,

13:54.000 --> 14:00.000
and without a group, many fall into a sense of meaninglessness. Sociologists Emile Durkheim

14:00.000 --> 14:05.280
first noticed the positive effects of war on mental health, the suicide rate,

14:05.280 --> 14:10.880
homicide, and admission to psych wards dropped down. Likewise, in natural disasters, people

14:10.880 --> 14:16.880
overwhelmingly devote their energy to the community rather than themselves. Adversity

14:16.880 --> 14:22.880
produces pro-social behaviors in which one is likely to abandon his self-interest and sacrifice

14:22.880 --> 14:28.720
himself for others, acting as a unified society, sending people back into a more ancient way of

14:28.720 --> 14:35.040
life. Modernity has disrupted the social bonds that has always characterized the human experience.

14:35.040 --> 14:40.560
It breeds comfort, allowing people to act selfishly. This shows an increase of mental

14:40.560 --> 14:47.200
illness in modern society's deep lack of a sense of community which the tripod historically provided

14:47.200 --> 14:54.640
us. We have much to learn from our ancestors in this regard. The world hangs on a thin thread,

14:54.640 --> 15:01.360
and that is the psyche of man. We are the great danger. How important it is to know something

15:01.360 --> 15:07.360
about it, but we know nothing about it. Jung warns us that we are pitifully unaware of our

15:07.360 --> 15:12.880
unconscious. We have become too rational and have lost contact with our primitive instincts,

15:12.880 --> 15:18.000
leading to a dissociation in the psyche of modern civilization. He writes,

15:18.000 --> 15:23.760
Things whose enormity nobody could have imagined in the idealic harmlessness of the first decade of

15:23.760 --> 15:30.080
our country have happened and have turned our world upside down. Ever since, the world has remained

15:30.080 --> 15:36.080
in a state of schizophrenia. Modern man does not understand how much his rationalism, which has

15:36.080 --> 15:42.320
destroyed his capacity to respond to numerous symbols and ideas, has put him at the mercy of

15:42.320 --> 15:48.160
this psychic underworld. He has freed himself from superstition, or so he believes. But in the

15:48.160 --> 15:54.560
process he has lost his spiritual values to a positively dangerous degree. His moral and spiritual

15:54.560 --> 16:01.920
tradition has disintegrated, and he's now paying the price for this breakup in worldwide disorientation

16:01.920 --> 16:08.000
and dissociation. The surface of our world seems to be cleansed of all superstitious

16:08.000 --> 16:14.160
and irrational elements. However, a realistic picture of the human mind reveals many primitive

16:14.160 --> 16:20.240
traits which are still playing their role just as if nothing had happened during the last centuries.

16:20.240 --> 16:26.720
Man feels himself isolated in the cosmos because he no longer has a deep relation with nature.

16:26.720 --> 16:32.480
When a primitive society's spiritual values are exposed to the impact of modern civilization,

16:32.480 --> 16:37.360
its people lose the meaning of their lives, their social organization disintegrates,

16:37.360 --> 16:43.760
and they themselves morally decay. As Ernest Becker writes, anthropologists have long known

16:43.760 --> 16:48.400
that when a tribe of people lose their feeling that their way of life is worthwhile,

16:48.400 --> 16:54.320
they may stop reproducing, or in large numbers simply lie down and die. Besides streams full

16:54.320 --> 17:01.600
of fish, food is not the primary nourishment of man. Unlike primitive man, modern man has lost

17:01.600 --> 17:08.240
contact with nature and his relationship with animals and trees through mystical participation.

17:08.240 --> 17:13.760
We may have advanced in the outer world, but our inner world is still delicate and fragmentary.

17:13.840 --> 17:20.880
A famous fictional example of the modern dissociation is Dr. Jackal and Mr. Hyde. In the story,

17:20.880 --> 17:28.240
Jackal's split took the form of a physical change, rather than as in reality an inner psychic state.

17:28.240 --> 17:35.040
Jung writes, we can be possessed and altered by moods, or become unreasonable and unable to recall

17:35.040 --> 17:40.400
important facts about ourselves or others. We talk about being able to control ourselves,

17:40.400 --> 17:46.240
but self-control is a rare and remarkable virtue. There is a world of difference between a conscious

17:46.240 --> 17:52.560
decision to split off and temporarily suppress a part of one's psyche, and a condition in which

17:52.560 --> 17:58.720
this happens spontaneously, without one's knowledge or consent and even against one's intention.

17:58.720 --> 18:05.440
The former is a civilized achievement, the latter a primitive loss of a soul, or even a pathological

18:05.440 --> 18:12.880
cause of a neurosis. In order to heal the split in the psyche, Jung tells us to explore our unconscious

18:12.880 --> 18:18.640
through self-reflection and dream journaling. We must understand that there are things within us

18:18.640 --> 18:25.120
that are beyond our control, which are autonomous personalities. Here's where we find the vital

18:25.120 --> 18:30.880
insight for our lives, and where the primitive aspects that form part of the original mind

18:30.880 --> 18:37.040
are preserved as archetypes. Despite our differences, we all share a collective unconscious,

18:37.040 --> 18:43.520
which adapts itself to the particularities of the individual's life. We have been so busy with

18:43.520 --> 18:50.720
the question of what we think that we entirely forgot to ask what the unconscious psyche thinks about us.
