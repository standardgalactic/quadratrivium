0	8400	Modern society is characterized by many things, but perhaps most notably by the remarkable scientific and technological advancement,
8400	12160	as well as capitalism, individualism and hedonism.
12160	17280	We are wealthier than our ancestors, we live in more safe and comfortable environments,
17280	20080	we have more access to food and other basic needs.
20080	24480	Why then have we seen a massive spike in mental illness?
24480	32160	The bulk of evidence concludes that there seems to have been a significant rise in the incidence of lunacy in the 19th century,
32160	38160	and that this increase consisted largely of patients with the illness we now call schizophrenia.
38160	45680	One of the most widely ramifying features of modernity is the intense focus on the value and power of the individual self,
45680	53280	to turn away from the search of an objective external order and to instead turn inward and become aware of our own activity.
53360	59120	This becomes a pervasive feature of human experience and self-knowledge in the 19th century,
59120	64160	Western cultures dominated by individualism, subjectivism and relativism,
64160	69520	with the rise of a new character type that dominates our age, the psychological man,
69520	72720	who is intent upon the conquest of his inner life.
72720	77280	Mental illness must also be viewed in line with a modern social structure,
77280	86400	with bureaucratization, technologization, secularization and rationalization of the modern world on the level of individual experience.
86400	91040	The conditions of modern life, with its rational forms of social organization,
91040	97120	are more complex, conflicting and require potentially disorienting cognitive requirements.
97120	104640	While there is an emphasis on individuality, one must also simultaneously adapt to society's evolving needs.
104720	110240	The problem arises when these two are in contradiction, leading to a sense of inner division.
110240	116560	In the myth of mental illness, psychiatrist Thomas Sass criticizes the psychiatric establishment,
116560	123760	who uses mental illness as a metaphor to describe an offending or disturbing pattern of behavior,
123760	129280	under the wide-ranging term schizophrenia, as an illness or disease, Sass wrote,
129280	134320	If you talk to God, you are praying. If God talks to you, you have schizophrenia.
134320	140320	If the dead talk to you, you are a spiritualist. If you talk to the dead, you are a schizophrenic.
140320	145920	While many behave and think in disturbing ways, this does not mean they actually have a disease.
145920	153680	Unlike physical illness and disease, mental illness is judged from certain psychosocial, ethical or legal norms.
153680	156720	Transgressing these is not a consequence of illness,
156720	160960	but of the attempt to confront and tackle the problems in living.
160960	166240	Sass does not suggest that mental illnesses do not exist. Rather, he's claiming that many such
166240	172000	phenomena is a consequence of the attempt to confront and tackle the problem of how to live,
172000	178880	and to identify such phenomena as a disease or an illness, is to hide the very real problems in
178880	184000	living that people face. With increasing understanding of himself and of the world,
184000	189520	modern man feels that he's free to direct his own life and must take responsibility for it.
189520	195600	We are, as Jean-Paul Sartre asserted, condemned to be free, condemned to shoulder the burden of our
195600	201760	freedom and responsibility without being able to seek refuge in others. We must be responsible
201760	207040	for ourselves, for we have no other way of experiencing ourselves or the world as being in
207040	212480	any other mode than our own existence. We cannot have our existence depend on somebody else,
212480	217440	for that would contradict the very core of our being. We can ask for other people's opinions,
217440	224480	but the choice ultimately lies in us. Many cannot stand this desing freedom. Kierkegaard says that
224480	229920	one can either get lost in the infinite, a state of analysis paralysis where one thinks of the
229920	235360	infinite possibilities but never acts, or get lost in the finite, becoming an imitation,
235360	241600	a number, a scythe in the crowd. The latter is a finitude to spare, or what we would now call
241600	247360	depressive psychosis. One cannot imagine any alternate ways of life and release himself
247360	253520	from the trivial obligations that give him no value. It is as if one has literally died to life,
253520	259600	but must remain physically in this world. One lives dyingly. Eventually, one faces the Y of
259600	265920	existence, as Albert Camus writes, rising, streetcar, four hours in the office or factory,
265920	272400	meal, streetcar, four hours of work, meal, sleep, and Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
272400	278400	Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, according to the same rhythm. This path is easily followed most
278400	284720	of the time, but one day the Y arises, and everything begins in that weariness tinged with
284720	291520	amazement. Camus' absurd person is one who is seen through the ridiculous repetitions of daily life.
291520	297600	He is conscious of his Sisyphian condemnation. We all have to push our own boulders and watch it
297600	303520	roll back down. If what we do does not satisfy our Y of existence, we must search for other
303520	310320	alternatives, or risk falling into an existential crisis, a nauseating sensation of trying to justify
310320	316880	one's existence, which can lead to suicide. One of Western civilization's most significant events
316880	323200	is the Age of Enlightenment in the 18th century, a period which undermined the values that society
323200	330080	had hitherto relied on, namely on the religious view. This engenders the most profound cultural,
330080	336160	sociological, and psychological repercussions, leaving many facing a crisis in discerning a
336160	340960	meaning or purpose for their existence, and struggling to tackle the problems in living
340960	346320	that this gives rise to. While we previously had ready answers to the problem of how life
346400	351920	ought to be lived and what its overall meaning and purpose was, since faith in the existence of God
351920	357680	gave us the reassurance that we are partaking in a divine project, we are now slowly experiencing
357680	363600	the consequences of what Nietzsche proclaimed as the death of God, whose full consequences would
363600	370240	elude many people as he made clear. This tremendous event is still on its way, still wondering,
370240	375680	it has not yet reached the ears of men. This deed is still more distant from them than the
375680	381680	most distant stars, and yet they have done it themselves. This realization forces us to be
381680	387920	faced with the terrifying question, has existence any meaning at all? The modern age is characterized
387920	394560	by a sense of disorientation, of not knowing what to do with one's life. One notable figure who
394560	400320	has attempted to respond to this existential crisis, and the psychological manifestations of
400320	406480	meaninglessness is Viktor Frankl, who had been left in an existential vacuum. The meaning crisis
406480	412720	and mass neurosis of modern times is the unheard cry for meaning. Frankl believes this is the
412720	418640	cause of much of modernity's increase in mental illness, it is the struggle to confront the
418640	425360	existential vacuum. He writes, such widespread phenomena as depression, aggression and addiction
425360	431680	are not understandable unless we recognize the existential vacuum underlying them. Frankl's
431680	438000	therapeutic response to those experiencing such phenomena is to reorient the person to the meaning
438000	443040	or the purpose of their existence, to confront the question of the meaning of their existence,
443040	449520	to explore the question and ultimately to provide a positive answer to it. Finding meaning to one's
449520	455360	life is not to be understood as some idle or academic curiosity that one engages in when more
455360	461360	fundamental needs have been met. The striving to search for and to possess a meaning or a purpose
461360	466960	for one's life is said to be the primary motivational force in man. Without a meaning,
466960	473600	all of life's struggles, strivings and projects become ultimately futile. Frankl believes that
473600	479920	this sense of futility is what characterizes addiction, aggression and depression. There is
479920	486000	nothing in the world that would so effectively help one to survive even the worst conditions as the
486000	492320	knowledge that there is a meaning in one's life. Frankl concludes, in a word, each man is questioned
492320	499520	by life and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life. To life he can only respond by
499520	505920	being responsible. Modern man is in desperate need for the hero journey. In Man and His Symbols,
505920	512240	Union psychologist Joseph Anderson describes the importance of the hero myth as a universal pattern
512240	517920	throughout the world. The hero descends into darkness to slay a dragon, rescue a damsel in
517920	524000	distress and gather the treasure. The early weakness of the hero is balanced by the appearance of
524080	529920	strong guardians who enable him to perform the tasks that he cannot accomplish unaided.
529920	535520	Their role is the development of one's strengths and weaknesses in a manner that will equip one
535520	541760	for the arduous tasks which life confronts him. This can be linked to being dependent on one's
541760	547920	parents. It is only when one becomes independent and confronts the world by himself that the individual
547920	555200	has passed his initial test and can enter the mature phase of life. In Memories, Dreams, Reflections,
555200	560800	Carl Jung's research brought him into the burning question what actually takes place inside the
560800	567200	mentally ill. He writes, to my mind, therapy only really begins after the investigation of that
567200	573600	holy personal story. It is the patient's secret, the rugged games which he is shattered. If I know
573600	579840	his secret story, I have a key to the treatment. In most cases, exploration of the conscious material
579840	586560	is insufficient. In therapy, the problem is always the whole person, never the symptom alone. We must
586560	593200	ask questions which challenge the whole personality. Jung treated many schizophrenic patients who were
593200	599280	considered a last cause. The paradox of schizophrenia is that there is both a dissolution of the self in
599280	606000	the world but also the dissolution of the world in the self. Eternal punishment but divine omnipotence.
606000	611440	The patient doubts that it is really him who is thinking his thoughts. Reality might as well be a
611440	618480	train of illusions produced in him by evil scientists. It is the most profound form of self-contradiction
618480	626240	to be both God and a worm. Jung, however, found out that many people who were diagnosed with schizophrenia
626240	632160	actually had ordinary depression as a result of traumas and difficult life experiences that had
632160	638480	been repressed. He tells the story of an 18-year-old girl who had been abused at the age of 15.
638480	644960	She retreated into isolation and concealed herself from people. She was taken to a mental hospital
644960	650880	and remained in a catatonic state. Over the course of many weeks, Jung gradually persuaded her to
651440	656800	After overcoming many resistances, she told Jung that she had been living on the moon. She said
656800	662560	that she did not like this world and that the moon was beautiful and life there was rich in meaning.
662560	669040	He writes, as a result of the incest to which she had been subjected as a girl, she felt humiliated
669040	674480	in the eyes of the world but elevated in the realm of fantasy. The consequence was complete
674480	680640	alienation from the world, a state of psychosis. She became extra mundane as it were and lost
680640	686640	contact with humanity. She plunged into cosmic distances into outer space where she met with
686640	693120	a winged demon. By telling me her story, she had in a sense betrayed the demon and attached herself
693120	699120	to an earthly human being. Thereafter, I regarded the sufferings of the mentally ill in a different
699120	704960	light for I had gained insight into the richness and importance of the inner experiences.
705600	711040	In his book Tribe, Sebastian Jung argues that throughout history, humans have had a strong
711040	717360	instinct to belong to small groups or tribes. These tribes gave people a purpose and understanding
717360	724560	of life. However, this tribal connection has been obliterated in modern society. During wars with
724560	730400	the Indian tribes, many European settlers were taken as prisoners and held within the tribes.
730400	736720	After they had a chance to escape and return to their modern society, many refused to do so. They
736720	743200	preferred the Primitive Society over their modern one. On the contrary, not one tribesman wanted
743200	749600	to flee to modern society. We have evolved genetically to live in an interdependent group
749600	755680	in order to survive, and this creates equality as everyone plays a necessary role in the tribe.
755680	762000	They work 12 hours a week to survive in contrast to the average 40 hours a week that many westernized
762000	768000	societies require. The tribes collaborate for survival. Each day they go to hunt and gather,
768000	773760	and in the evening they return to share the food. People often believe that modern life with all
773840	779600	its efficient technology has allowed for more leisure time. However, the exact opposite is true.
779600	785520	Modern life is characterized by a desperate cycle of work, financial obligation, and more work,
785520	791520	sacrificing personal freedom. One might argue, however, that modernity has allowed for a sense
791520	797360	of independence, which primitive man could never have achieved, leading to a sense of freedom,
797360	803760	but can also lead to a feeling of alienation and depression. We have not yet been genetically
803760	810000	adapted to our environment. The enormous changes of agriculture and the industrial revolution have
810000	815840	hardly begun to affect our gene pool. In other words, even though we live in more complex societies,
815840	822080	we are still hardwired to be hunter-gatherers. Today we can be surrounded by a group of people
822080	827920	and yet feel completely alone. This is not something we have experienced until quite recently.
827920	834000	We are wired to belong to a group where we feel valued by our contributions to it,
834000	840000	and without a group, many fall into a sense of meaninglessness. Sociologists Emile Durkheim
840000	845280	first noticed the positive effects of war on mental health, the suicide rate,
845280	850880	homicide, and admission to psych wards dropped down. Likewise, in natural disasters, people
850880	856880	overwhelmingly devote their energy to the community rather than themselves. Adversity
856880	862880	produces pro-social behaviors in which one is likely to abandon his self-interest and sacrifice
862880	868720	himself for others, acting as a unified society, sending people back into a more ancient way of
868720	875040	life. Modernity has disrupted the social bonds that has always characterized the human experience.
875040	880560	It breeds comfort, allowing people to act selfishly. This shows an increase of mental
880560	887200	illness in modern society's deep lack of a sense of community which the tripod historically provided
887200	894640	us. We have much to learn from our ancestors in this regard. The world hangs on a thin thread,
894640	901360	and that is the psyche of man. We are the great danger. How important it is to know something
901360	907360	about it, but we know nothing about it. Jung warns us that we are pitifully unaware of our
907360	912880	unconscious. We have become too rational and have lost contact with our primitive instincts,
912880	918000	leading to a dissociation in the psyche of modern civilization. He writes,
918000	923760	Things whose enormity nobody could have imagined in the idealic harmlessness of the first decade of
923760	930080	our country have happened and have turned our world upside down. Ever since, the world has remained
930080	936080	in a state of schizophrenia. Modern man does not understand how much his rationalism, which has
936080	942320	destroyed his capacity to respond to numerous symbols and ideas, has put him at the mercy of
942320	948160	this psychic underworld. He has freed himself from superstition, or so he believes. But in the
948160	954560	process he has lost his spiritual values to a positively dangerous degree. His moral and spiritual
954560	961920	tradition has disintegrated, and he's now paying the price for this breakup in worldwide disorientation
961920	968000	and dissociation. The surface of our world seems to be cleansed of all superstitious
968000	974160	and irrational elements. However, a realistic picture of the human mind reveals many primitive
974160	980240	traits which are still playing their role just as if nothing had happened during the last centuries.
980240	986720	Man feels himself isolated in the cosmos because he no longer has a deep relation with nature.
986720	992480	When a primitive society's spiritual values are exposed to the impact of modern civilization,
992480	997360	its people lose the meaning of their lives, their social organization disintegrates,
997360	1003760	and they themselves morally decay. As Ernest Becker writes, anthropologists have long known
1003760	1008400	that when a tribe of people lose their feeling that their way of life is worthwhile,
1008400	1014320	they may stop reproducing, or in large numbers simply lie down and die. Besides streams full
1014320	1021600	of fish, food is not the primary nourishment of man. Unlike primitive man, modern man has lost
1021600	1028240	contact with nature and his relationship with animals and trees through mystical participation.
1028240	1033760	We may have advanced in the outer world, but our inner world is still delicate and fragmentary.
1033840	1040880	A famous fictional example of the modern dissociation is Dr. Jackal and Mr. Hyde. In the story,
1040880	1048240	Jackal's split took the form of a physical change, rather than as in reality an inner psychic state.
1048240	1055040	Jung writes, we can be possessed and altered by moods, or become unreasonable and unable to recall
1055040	1060400	important facts about ourselves or others. We talk about being able to control ourselves,
1060400	1066240	but self-control is a rare and remarkable virtue. There is a world of difference between a conscious
1066240	1072560	decision to split off and temporarily suppress a part of one's psyche, and a condition in which
1072560	1078720	this happens spontaneously, without one's knowledge or consent and even against one's intention.
1078720	1085440	The former is a civilized achievement, the latter a primitive loss of a soul, or even a pathological
1085440	1092880	cause of a neurosis. In order to heal the split in the psyche, Jung tells us to explore our unconscious
1092880	1098640	through self-reflection and dream journaling. We must understand that there are things within us
1098640	1105120	that are beyond our control, which are autonomous personalities. Here's where we find the vital
1105120	1110880	insight for our lives, and where the primitive aspects that form part of the original mind
1110880	1117040	are preserved as archetypes. Despite our differences, we all share a collective unconscious,
1117040	1123520	which adapts itself to the particularities of the individual's life. We have been so busy with
1123520	1130720	the question of what we think that we entirely forgot to ask what the unconscious psyche thinks about us.
