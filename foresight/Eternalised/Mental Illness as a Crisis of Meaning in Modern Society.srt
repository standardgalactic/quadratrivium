1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,400
Modern society is characterized by many things, but perhaps most notably by the remarkable scientific and technological advancement,

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,160
as well as capitalism, individualism and hedonism.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,280
We are wealthier than our ancestors, we live in more safe and comfortable environments,

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,080
we have more access to food and other basic needs.

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,480
Why then have we seen a massive spike in mental illness?

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:32,160
The bulk of evidence concludes that there seems to have been a significant rise in the incidence of lunacy in the 19th century,

7
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:38,160
and that this increase consisted largely of patients with the illness we now call schizophrenia.

8
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:45,680
One of the most widely ramifying features of modernity is the intense focus on the value and power of the individual self,

9
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:53,280
to turn away from the search of an objective external order and to instead turn inward and become aware of our own activity.

10
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,120
This becomes a pervasive feature of human experience and self-knowledge in the 19th century,

11
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,160
Western cultures dominated by individualism, subjectivism and relativism,

12
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:09,520
with the rise of a new character type that dominates our age, the psychological man,

13
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,720
who is intent upon the conquest of his inner life.

14
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,280
Mental illness must also be viewed in line with a modern social structure,

15
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:26,400
with bureaucratization, technologization, secularization and rationalization of the modern world on the level of individual experience.

16
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,040
The conditions of modern life, with its rational forms of social organization,

17
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,120
are more complex, conflicting and require potentially disorienting cognitive requirements.

18
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:44,640
While there is an emphasis on individuality, one must also simultaneously adapt to society's evolving needs.

19
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:50,240
The problem arises when these two are in contradiction, leading to a sense of inner division.

20
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:56,560
In the myth of mental illness, psychiatrist Thomas Sass criticizes the psychiatric establishment,

21
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:03,760
who uses mental illness as a metaphor to describe an offending or disturbing pattern of behavior,

22
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:09,280
under the wide-ranging term schizophrenia, as an illness or disease, Sass wrote,

23
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,320
If you talk to God, you are praying. If God talks to you, you have schizophrenia.

24
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:20,320
If the dead talk to you, you are a spiritualist. If you talk to the dead, you are a schizophrenic.

25
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,920
While many behave and think in disturbing ways, this does not mean they actually have a disease.

26
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:33,680
Unlike physical illness and disease, mental illness is judged from certain psychosocial, ethical or legal norms.

27
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,720
Transgressing these is not a consequence of illness,

28
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,960
but of the attempt to confront and tackle the problems in living.

29
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:46,240
Sass does not suggest that mental illnesses do not exist. Rather, he's claiming that many such

30
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:52,000
phenomena is a consequence of the attempt to confront and tackle the problem of how to live,

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,880
and to identify such phenomena as a disease or an illness, is to hide the very real problems in

32
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:04,000
living that people face. With increasing understanding of himself and of the world,

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,520
modern man feels that he's free to direct his own life and must take responsibility for it.

34
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:15,600
We are, as Jean-Paul Sartre asserted, condemned to be free, condemned to shoulder the burden of our

35
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:21,760
freedom and responsibility without being able to seek refuge in others. We must be responsible

36
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,040
for ourselves, for we have no other way of experiencing ourselves or the world as being in

37
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,480
any other mode than our own existence. We cannot have our existence depend on somebody else,

38
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,440
for that would contradict the very core of our being. We can ask for other people's opinions,

39
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:44,480
but the choice ultimately lies in us. Many cannot stand this desing freedom. Kierkegaard says that

40
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,920
one can either get lost in the infinite, a state of analysis paralysis where one thinks of the

41
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,360
infinite possibilities but never acts, or get lost in the finite, becoming an imitation,

42
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,600
a number, a scythe in the crowd. The latter is a finitude to spare, or what we would now call

43
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:07,360
depressive psychosis. One cannot imagine any alternate ways of life and release himself

44
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,520
from the trivial obligations that give him no value. It is as if one has literally died to life,

45
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:19,600
but must remain physically in this world. One lives dyingly. Eventually, one faces the Y of

46
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,920
existence, as Albert Camus writes, rising, streetcar, four hours in the office or factory,

47
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:32,400
meal, streetcar, four hours of work, meal, sleep, and Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,

48
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,400
Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, according to the same rhythm. This path is easily followed most

49
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,720
of the time, but one day the Y arises, and everything begins in that weariness tinged with

50
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:51,520
amazement. Camus' absurd person is one who is seen through the ridiculous repetitions of daily life.

51
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,600
He is conscious of his Sisyphian condemnation. We all have to push our own boulders and watch it

52
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,520
roll back down. If what we do does not satisfy our Y of existence, we must search for other

53
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:10,320
alternatives, or risk falling into an existential crisis, a nauseating sensation of trying to justify

54
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:16,880
one's existence, which can lead to suicide. One of Western civilization's most significant events

55
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:23,200
is the Age of Enlightenment in the 18th century, a period which undermined the values that society

56
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:30,080
had hitherto relied on, namely on the religious view. This engenders the most profound cultural,

57
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:36,160
sociological, and psychological repercussions, leaving many facing a crisis in discerning a

58
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,960
meaning or purpose for their existence, and struggling to tackle the problems in living

59
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,320
that this gives rise to. While we previously had ready answers to the problem of how life

60
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,920
ought to be lived and what its overall meaning and purpose was, since faith in the existence of God

61
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:57,680
gave us the reassurance that we are partaking in a divine project, we are now slowly experiencing

62
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,600
the consequences of what Nietzsche proclaimed as the death of God, whose full consequences would

63
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:10,240
elude many people as he made clear. This tremendous event is still on its way, still wondering,

64
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,680
it has not yet reached the ears of men. This deed is still more distant from them than the

65
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,680
most distant stars, and yet they have done it themselves. This realization forces us to be

66
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,920
faced with the terrifying question, has existence any meaning at all? The modern age is characterized

67
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:34,560
by a sense of disorientation, of not knowing what to do with one's life. One notable figure who

68
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,320
has attempted to respond to this existential crisis, and the psychological manifestations of

69
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:46,480
meaninglessness is Viktor Frankl, who had been left in an existential vacuum. The meaning crisis

70
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:52,720
and mass neurosis of modern times is the unheard cry for meaning. Frankl believes this is the

71
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,640
cause of much of modernity's increase in mental illness, it is the struggle to confront the

72
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:05,360
existential vacuum. He writes, such widespread phenomena as depression, aggression and addiction

73
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:11,680
are not understandable unless we recognize the existential vacuum underlying them. Frankl's

74
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:18,000
therapeutic response to those experiencing such phenomena is to reorient the person to the meaning

75
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,040
or the purpose of their existence, to confront the question of the meaning of their existence,

76
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:29,520
to explore the question and ultimately to provide a positive answer to it. Finding meaning to one's

77
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,360
life is not to be understood as some idle or academic curiosity that one engages in when more

78
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:41,360
fundamental needs have been met. The striving to search for and to possess a meaning or a purpose

79
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,960
for one's life is said to be the primary motivational force in man. Without a meaning,

80
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:53,600
all of life's struggles, strivings and projects become ultimately futile. Frankl believes that

81
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:59,920
this sense of futility is what characterizes addiction, aggression and depression. There is

82
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:06,000
nothing in the world that would so effectively help one to survive even the worst conditions as the

83
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,320
knowledge that there is a meaning in one's life. Frankl concludes, in a word, each man is questioned

84
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:19,520
by life and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life. To life he can only respond by

85
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:25,920
being responsible. Modern man is in desperate need for the hero journey. In Man and His Symbols,

86
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:32,240
Union psychologist Joseph Anderson describes the importance of the hero myth as a universal pattern

87
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,920
throughout the world. The hero descends into darkness to slay a dragon, rescue a damsel in

88
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:44,000
distress and gather the treasure. The early weakness of the hero is balanced by the appearance of

89
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,920
strong guardians who enable him to perform the tasks that he cannot accomplish unaided.

90
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,520
Their role is the development of one's strengths and weaknesses in a manner that will equip one

91
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:01,760
for the arduous tasks which life confronts him. This can be linked to being dependent on one's

92
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,920
parents. It is only when one becomes independent and confronts the world by himself that the individual

93
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:15,200
has passed his initial test and can enter the mature phase of life. In Memories, Dreams, Reflections,

94
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,800
Carl Jung's research brought him into the burning question what actually takes place inside the

95
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:27,200
mentally ill. He writes, to my mind, therapy only really begins after the investigation of that

96
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:33,600
holy personal story. It is the patient's secret, the rugged games which he is shattered. If I know

97
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:39,840
his secret story, I have a key to the treatment. In most cases, exploration of the conscious material

98
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:46,560
is insufficient. In therapy, the problem is always the whole person, never the symptom alone. We must

99
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:53,200
ask questions which challenge the whole personality. Jung treated many schizophrenic patients who were

100
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:59,280
considered a last cause. The paradox of schizophrenia is that there is both a dissolution of the self in

101
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:06,000
the world but also the dissolution of the world in the self. Eternal punishment but divine omnipotence.

102
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,440
The patient doubts that it is really him who is thinking his thoughts. Reality might as well be a

103
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:18,480
train of illusions produced in him by evil scientists. It is the most profound form of self-contradiction

104
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:26,240
to be both God and a worm. Jung, however, found out that many people who were diagnosed with schizophrenia

105
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:32,160
actually had ordinary depression as a result of traumas and difficult life experiences that had

106
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:38,480
been repressed. He tells the story of an 18-year-old girl who had been abused at the age of 15.

107
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:44,960
She retreated into isolation and concealed herself from people. She was taken to a mental hospital

108
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:50,880
and remained in a catatonic state. Over the course of many weeks, Jung gradually persuaded her to

109
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,800
After overcoming many resistances, she told Jung that she had been living on the moon. She said

110
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:02,560
that she did not like this world and that the moon was beautiful and life there was rich in meaning.

111
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:09,040
He writes, as a result of the incest to which she had been subjected as a girl, she felt humiliated

112
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,480
in the eyes of the world but elevated in the realm of fantasy. The consequence was complete

113
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,640
alienation from the world, a state of psychosis. She became extra mundane as it were and lost

114
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:26,640
contact with humanity. She plunged into cosmic distances into outer space where she met with

115
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:33,120
a winged demon. By telling me her story, she had in a sense betrayed the demon and attached herself

116
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:39,120
to an earthly human being. Thereafter, I regarded the sufferings of the mentally ill in a different

117
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,960
light for I had gained insight into the richness and importance of the inner experiences.

118
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:51,040
In his book Tribe, Sebastian Jung argues that throughout history, humans have had a strong

119
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:57,360
instinct to belong to small groups or tribes. These tribes gave people a purpose and understanding

120
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:04,560
of life. However, this tribal connection has been obliterated in modern society. During wars with

121
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:10,400
the Indian tribes, many European settlers were taken as prisoners and held within the tribes.

122
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:16,720
After they had a chance to escape and return to their modern society, many refused to do so. They

123
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:23,200
preferred the Primitive Society over their modern one. On the contrary, not one tribesman wanted

124
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:29,600
to flee to modern society. We have evolved genetically to live in an interdependent group

125
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,680
in order to survive, and this creates equality as everyone plays a necessary role in the tribe.

126
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:42,000
They work 12 hours a week to survive in contrast to the average 40 hours a week that many westernized

127
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
societies require. The tribes collaborate for survival. Each day they go to hunt and gather,

128
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,760
and in the evening they return to share the food. People often believe that modern life with all

129
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:59,600
its efficient technology has allowed for more leisure time. However, the exact opposite is true.

130
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,520
Modern life is characterized by a desperate cycle of work, financial obligation, and more work,

131
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:11,520
sacrificing personal freedom. One might argue, however, that modernity has allowed for a sense

132
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:17,360
of independence, which primitive man could never have achieved, leading to a sense of freedom,

133
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:23,760
but can also lead to a feeling of alienation and depression. We have not yet been genetically

134
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:30,000
adapted to our environment. The enormous changes of agriculture and the industrial revolution have

135
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,840
hardly begun to affect our gene pool. In other words, even though we live in more complex societies,

136
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:42,080
we are still hardwired to be hunter-gatherers. Today we can be surrounded by a group of people

137
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:47,920
and yet feel completely alone. This is not something we have experienced until quite recently.

138
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:54,000
We are wired to belong to a group where we feel valued by our contributions to it,

139
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,000
and without a group, many fall into a sense of meaninglessness. Sociologists Emile Durkheim

140
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,280
first noticed the positive effects of war on mental health, the suicide rate,

141
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:10,880
homicide, and admission to psych wards dropped down. Likewise, in natural disasters, people

142
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:16,880
overwhelmingly devote their energy to the community rather than themselves. Adversity

143
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:22,880
produces pro-social behaviors in which one is likely to abandon his self-interest and sacrifice

144
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:28,720
himself for others, acting as a unified society, sending people back into a more ancient way of

145
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:35,040
life. Modernity has disrupted the social bonds that has always characterized the human experience.

146
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,560
It breeds comfort, allowing people to act selfishly. This shows an increase of mental

147
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:47,200
illness in modern society's deep lack of a sense of community which the tripod historically provided

148
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:54,640
us. We have much to learn from our ancestors in this regard. The world hangs on a thin thread,

149
00:14:54,640 --> 00:15:01,360
and that is the psyche of man. We are the great danger. How important it is to know something

150
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:07,360
about it, but we know nothing about it. Jung warns us that we are pitifully unaware of our

151
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,880
unconscious. We have become too rational and have lost contact with our primitive instincts,

152
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:18,000
leading to a dissociation in the psyche of modern civilization. He writes,

153
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,760
Things whose enormity nobody could have imagined in the idealic harmlessness of the first decade of

154
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:30,080
our country have happened and have turned our world upside down. Ever since, the world has remained

155
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:36,080
in a state of schizophrenia. Modern man does not understand how much his rationalism, which has

156
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:42,320
destroyed his capacity to respond to numerous symbols and ideas, has put him at the mercy of

157
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:48,160
this psychic underworld. He has freed himself from superstition, or so he believes. But in the

158
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:54,560
process he has lost his spiritual values to a positively dangerous degree. His moral and spiritual

159
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:01,920
tradition has disintegrated, and he's now paying the price for this breakup in worldwide disorientation

160
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:08,000
and dissociation. The surface of our world seems to be cleansed of all superstitious

161
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,160
and irrational elements. However, a realistic picture of the human mind reveals many primitive

162
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:20,240
traits which are still playing their role just as if nothing had happened during the last centuries.

163
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:26,720
Man feels himself isolated in the cosmos because he no longer has a deep relation with nature.

164
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:32,480
When a primitive society's spiritual values are exposed to the impact of modern civilization,

165
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,360
its people lose the meaning of their lives, their social organization disintegrates,

166
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,760
and they themselves morally decay. As Ernest Becker writes, anthropologists have long known

167
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:48,400
that when a tribe of people lose their feeling that their way of life is worthwhile,

168
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:54,320
they may stop reproducing, or in large numbers simply lie down and die. Besides streams full

169
00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:01,600
of fish, food is not the primary nourishment of man. Unlike primitive man, modern man has lost

170
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:08,240
contact with nature and his relationship with animals and trees through mystical participation.

171
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,760
We may have advanced in the outer world, but our inner world is still delicate and fragmentary.

172
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:20,880
A famous fictional example of the modern dissociation is Dr. Jackal and Mr. Hyde. In the story,

173
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:28,240
Jackal's split took the form of a physical change, rather than as in reality an inner psychic state.

174
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:35,040
Jung writes, we can be possessed and altered by moods, or become unreasonable and unable to recall

175
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:40,400
important facts about ourselves or others. We talk about being able to control ourselves,

176
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:46,240
but self-control is a rare and remarkable virtue. There is a world of difference between a conscious

177
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:52,560
decision to split off and temporarily suppress a part of one's psyche, and a condition in which

178
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:58,720
this happens spontaneously, without one's knowledge or consent and even against one's intention.

179
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:05,440
The former is a civilized achievement, the latter a primitive loss of a soul, or even a pathological

180
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:12,880
cause of a neurosis. In order to heal the split in the psyche, Jung tells us to explore our unconscious

181
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:18,640
through self-reflection and dream journaling. We must understand that there are things within us

182
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:25,120
that are beyond our control, which are autonomous personalities. Here's where we find the vital

183
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:30,880
insight for our lives, and where the primitive aspects that form part of the original mind

184
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:37,040
are preserved as archetypes. Despite our differences, we all share a collective unconscious,

185
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:43,520
which adapts itself to the particularities of the individual's life. We have been so busy with

186
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:50,720
the question of what we think that we entirely forgot to ask what the unconscious psyche thinks about us.
