1. **Historical Context of AI**: Marvin Minsky's contributions and the long evolution of AI, which took about 60 years to become a consolidated field, similar to the time it took for the steam engine to become established. AI remains an experimental artifact, with a lack of comprehensive theoretical understanding, particularly in the area of statistical learning.

2. **AI as an Experiment**: As an experiment, AI operates with a level of complexity that is not fully understood, akin to past machines whose behaviors were also not always predictable. This experimental phase comes with inherent risks and uncertainties.

3. **Monopolization in Computing**: Information technologies have historically led to monopolization faster than other sectors, and AI is accelerating this trend. Large companies are leveraging AI to maintain and extend their monopolistic positions within capitalism.

4. **Utopian Potential of AI**: There is a hopeful perspective that AI, as a manifestation of the 'general intellect' or a collective intelligence, could have liberatory potential, challenging and eventually overcoming capitalist structures. However, this view must consider the social division of labor and the ways in which AI is already reshaping it.

5. **AI's Impact on Labor**: AI is not just automating work but also transforming the management of labor through platformization. This is evident in the rise of gig economy jobs, where workers are increasingly controlled by online platforms. AI acts as a centralized apparatus that organizes labor in a way that multiplies the number of workers while replacing traditional managers.

6. **Societal Implications**: The transformation of the labor market due to AI suggests a shift towards a new social order, where humans become more like gig workers serving an automated intelligence system. This raises questions about the future role of humanity within the structures created by AI and the potential for AI to redefine our relationship with work and management.

In summary, while AI offers significant opportunities for economic growth and efficiency, it also presents challenges related to power dynamics, monopolization, and the potential reshaping of labor and societal structures. The utopian or dystopian outcomes of AI depend on how society chooses to navigate these transformations.
