1. **Half-Grids in P3**: We are considering non-projectively equivalent half-grids in the projective 3-space P3, specifically 4-4 half-grids. These are sets of points such that for any line not contained in the quadric surface containing the points, there are exactly two lines through a point of the half-grid that do not lie on the quadric surface.

2. **Classification**: The classification of these 4-4 half-grids results in two distinct cases:
   - **Unharmonic Case**: Here, the points are aligned in columns and also aligned in the last row. The coordinates of the points follow a pattern involving the primitive sixth root of unity, epsilon.
   - **Harmonic Case**: In this case, the points in the columns are collinear, and there are no collinearities in the rows. The points lie on two sets of transversals that intersect at exactly one point.

3. **Permutations**: Permutations that leave the cross-ratio invariant are considered, including those that are involuntary (the four permutations associated with the lines) and those specific to the harmonic and unharmonic cases. In the harmonic case, there are eight additional permutations, and in the unharmonic case, there are twelve.

4. **Transversals**: The existence of two transversals for any line containing a point of the half-grid is significant. If one line is removed from the half-grid, the remaining points form a 3-4 grid or a default configuration, which in the case of a 4-4 half-grid cannot be a default configuration as it would lack the four aligned points.

5. **Future Work**: The next challenge is to classify AB half-grids where A is at least 5 and B is greater than or equal to 8. This is an open problem that remains to be solved.

6. **Implications for the Logo**: The discussion of these half-grids is related to the logo worn by the presenter, which incorporates the concept of default configurations within its design, reflecting the mathematical principles discussed in the classification of half-grids.
