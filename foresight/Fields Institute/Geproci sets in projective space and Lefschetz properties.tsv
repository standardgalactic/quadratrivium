0	13000	Thank you. First of all, I would like to thank the organizers for inviting me here, for letting me come here with Carolina, and for accepting the talk.
13000	24000	So I'm going to speak about the joint project with Luca Chiantini, Giuseppe Favacchio, Brian Harvon, Juan Miore, Thomas Schenberg, and Justin Ashpond.
24000	36000	And for short, I will call these polytools, because there are three Polish members to Italian and to US-based members.
37000	47000	And this is our logo. See on my t-shirt, I guess Giuseppe also has the same t-shirt, but he didn't show me the talk.
47000	58000	So the logo is not just a logo, it has some meaning. I hope it will be visible after my talk.
58000	68000	And the talk is based on two preprints. The first one is the same as Giuseppe was talking about, but not chapter two, the rest of chapters.
68000	80000	And the second is the new preprint from 2023. Both preprints are available at ARCH.
81000	87000	So let me start with the definition of the property.
87000	101000	So if we have a property p, whatever property you would like, and a finite set of points z in the projective space over the fields of complex numbers.
101000	117000	I will drop this assumption. I won't write c in the next slides, but all the talk is for projective and dimensional space over c, or then three-dimensional space.
117000	137000	And we say that a set c is a general projection from a general point to a hyperplane, which is isomorphic to pn-1, as the property p.
137000	146000	So for example, we can think of the property p as being Gorinstein, and then we can speak of Gepro-Gorinstein sets.
146000	159000	We can also say about p being a complete intersection, so ci, and that is how Gepro-T sets come from.
159000	164000	And there are lots of open problems connected with Gepro-P sets.
164000	175000	So they are very open, and the first is given a certain property, classify Gepro-P sets in pn.
175000	183000	So it is very, very general, and this is a starting open problem.
184000	198000	You can consider a property like being Gorinstein, and then you can try to classify Gepro-Gorinstein sets in pn.
198000	206000	You can note that Gepro-Gorinstein sets are Gepro-Gorinstein sets, but not the other way around.
206000	212000	And you can also try to classify Gepro-T sets in pn.
212000	225000	This is also very general, and in this talk I would like to say something about Gepro-T sets in p3, since we don't know any examples in pn.
225000	229000	And we have some classifications in p3.
229000	237000	So let's move to p3, and from now on everything is going on in p3.
237000	246000	So we say that a finite set of points z is an ab Gepro-T set.
246000	254000	If its general projection to a plane is an intersection of curves of degree a and b.
254000	270000	So we have a set of points in p3, and we project this set from a general point to a general plane, and the result lies on the intersection of two curves of degree a and b.
270000	274000	This is an ab Gepro-T set.
274000	281000	And we call the set, the Gepro-T set, the generate if it is contained in a plane.
281000	287000	So here you have two curves, these curves are of degree two.
287000	310000	And our set z contains four points, the intersection points, and then if you take any point somewhere in the space p3, and you project to another plane, the images of these curves would be the curves whose intersection is the complete intersection.
310000	321000	So this is a very simple example, and we don't want to speak about this kind of example.
322000	332000	The question asked by Francesco Polizzi in 2011 was whether every Gepro-T set in p3 is degenerate.
332000	345000	So is it true that all these sets are in fact sets contained in a plane and projected to another plane?
345000	360000	So if we think about the answer, we may think about two curves in p3 intersecting, because in the plane it is what happens.
360000	370000	We have two curves which intersect, and then we project, and the images of these curves would give this complete intersection.
370000	390000	And the theorem of Dufida and Dias from 1986 says that if we have two smooth irreducible non-degenerate curves in p3 of degrees A and B, then the number of intersection points is bounded by this number.
391000	400000	So it is A-1 times B-1 plus 1, so it is not even close to A times B.
400000	406000	So this is not the way how we can construct the Gepro-T set.
406000	415000	Let me mention also the second part of the theorem, the maximal value achieved if both curves are on the same quadric.
415000	424000	I want to mention it because quadrics play a role here in this theorem.
424000	441000	So as I have already said, the set of intersection points of two smooth irreducible non-degenerate curves in p3 of degrees A and B is not an A-B Gepro-T set.
441000	452000	So we have to look for another method to construct or to give examples of such sets.
452000	456000	Okay, so let me tell you what was the answer.
456000	466000	The answer was given by Dmitry Panov in the same year, in 2009.
466000	471000	Let me recall the question was, is every Gepro-T set degenerate?
471000	477000	So does the point lie on a surface already?
477000	480000	And Panov said, no, it is not true.
480000	488000	So there are sets of points which are not on a surface and are Gepro-T, and these sets are called grids.
488000	492000	So what is a grid?
492000	495000	Let me say what is an A-B grid.
495000	506000	An A-B grid is a set of A times B points, which are of the form A intersected with B.
506000	508000	So the intersection of two sets.
508000	513000	And the first set is the union of pairwise disjoint lines.
513000	520000	And the second is the union of, let's say, more pairwise disjoint lines.
520000	530000	So that each lines from the set A meet each line of the set B in exactly one point.
530000	538000	So if we consider the sets in B3, we will just see on a simple example how it looks.
538000	545000	I took it from Brian's presentation, so here we see a two or three grid.
545000	553000	So one set of lines is black lines, and the other set is the orange lines.
553000	566000	So these are two sets in B3 having six intersection points, and these six intersection points are called the grid.
566000	570000	And why grids are Gepro-T sets?
570000	576000	So let us see on the example.
576000	591000	We have this grid in the space, and if we project from a general point in a space to a general hyperplane, then we get the black lines are projected.
591000	596000	So black lines and the orange lines are projected to orange lines.
596000	604000	Of course now the lines intersect, but this is not a problem because we look at the intersection point of the two curves.
604000	609000	One curve is a black curve, and the other curve is the orange curve.
609000	617000	So the black curve intersects with the orange curve in six points, and this is the complete intersection.
617000	628000	So the grid above is a Gepro-T set, here it is a two or three Gepro-T.
628000	636000	Okay, so we may now consider whether there are some other Gepro-T sets which are not the generative and not grids.
636000	640000	We will call these sets non-trivial.
640000	648000	So trivial if they are the generative of grids, and now we are looking for non-trivial, a Gepro-T set.
648000	657000	And the modified question of quality would look like this, is it true that every Gepro-T set in P3 is trivial?
657000	665000	And if it's not trivial, is it possible to classify the Gepro-T sets at the productive equivalence?
665000	673000	Maybe not all, maybe just for some small number of points.
673000	684000	So let us look for, on the first example, this is the, the example is the D4 configuration.
684000	700000	And it was studied by Alessandra Bernardi, Luca Piantini, Graham Benham, Giuseppe Favacchio, Brian Harbourn, Juan Miliore, Thomas Schenberg, and Justina Spahn during the previous lecture workshop in Meditaterme.
700000	703000	So this configuration looks like this.
703000	713000	We have, we have, let's think of a cube, so eight vertices.
713000	723000	Here we have six vertices, and the, sorry, seven vertices, and the other one is hidden behind.
723000	737000	So we take these eight vertices, then we add the vertices, which are the centers of perspectives of all the faces of the cube, and we add the middle point of the cube.
737000	749000	So altogether, these are 12 points, and these, these 12 points form a D4 configuration.
749000	758000	We may also give coordinates to the points, especially when somebody doesn't like to speak about the cube in the productive space.
758000	768000	So this is a set of 12 points with such configuration, such coordinates, is the D4 configuration.
768000	784000	And the D4 configuration lies on four disjoint lines, on different sets of four disjoint lines, let me tell you one set, so this is the set here on this slide.
784000	797000	So, if we have this D4 configuration in P3, we can project to a plane from a general point.
797000	807000	And then, of course, if we project collinear points, we get collinear points in P2, in the hyperplane to which we project.
807000	828000	So, we may take the solid lines, this is one line, then the other line, and this line, these are the lines which cover nine points of the configuration.
828000	841000	And there is also one more line which goes through the front vertex, the middle vertex, and the vertex in the back.
841000	857000	So, if you project the black lines, go to black lines on the right-hand side, this line, which is not visible, the points are not visible, goes to the grey line.
857000	870000	And because the points lie on a cone of D3, we have also the curve of D3 after projection.
870000	877000	So, we can choose the lines differently, so we can choose, for example, the dashed line or the dotted line.
877000	893000	So, there are more possibilities to choose the lines, but in any case, after the projection, the twelve sets lie on four lines and a cubic curve.
893000	899000	So, this is a 3-4 Geoprote set on the bridge.
899000	916000	And it is not agreed why it is not agreed, because we cannot take the curve of D3 to be three lines, because of the position.
916000	927000	We have also another example, it's a four configuration, which I cannot draw, but I can give you the coordinates of the points.
927000	944000	And this configuration consists of 24 points, so two times D4, the number of points in D4, and this is not the coincidence, because the points which are green here are exactly the points of D4 configuration.
944000	952000	And the rest of the points are also D4 configuration, but not somewhere away.
952000	964000	So, two D4 configuration grew up to an F4 configuration of 24 points, which lies on six disjoint lines.
964000	971000	And it's not a 4-6 Geoprote set.
971000	982000	And it is built up with 4-4 grid and on a quadric and two sets of four points which are aligned.
982000	990000	So, in the case of D4, there was a 3-3 grid inside and a line outside.
990000	997000	Now we have 4-4 grid and two lines outside of the bridge.
997000	1011000	And we may ask the question, for which pairs of positive integers, A and B, let's say that A is less or equal than B, does there exist a non-trivial Geoprote set?
1011000	1019000	So, a set which is non-degenerate and it's not very quick.
1019000	1046000	And we know the theorem from the paper of Gentini and Liora, published in 2021, that if we have a set of non-degenerate and non-degenerate A, B, Geoprote set, when both of A and B are at most three, then Z is a grid.
1047000	1061000	So, the first, the smaller number of smaller numbers that can occur as A and B, for the set not to be a grid, maybe three and four.
1061000	1072000	So, the question is to classify all three-four Geoprote sets into three.
1072000	1087000	And we have a theorem in the preprint from 2022, that if a set Z is a non-degenerate 3B Geoprote set in B3, then there are two possibilities.
1087000	1094000	The first one is that it is a 3B grid and B is any number.
1094000	1100000	We assume just B is greater than 3.
1100000	1108000	And the other option is that it is a D4 configuration, so a 3, 4 Geoprote.
1108000	1122000	So, this means that there are no Geoprote sets, like 3B Geoprote sets for B greater than 4.
1122000	1140000	And the proof goes through different cases, whether the points like are in general position, linear general position, or like on the twisted cubic, there are several cases which we consider.
1140000	1155000	And we come to this result that if you have 3B Geoprote sets, that it must be a D4 or a 3B grid.
1155000	1173000	So, we ask a question for which pair of integers A and B, which are both above 3, whether exist non-degenerate, non-grid AB Geoprote sets in B3.
1173000	1188000	So, if you are given AB, can you construct an AB Geoprote set if this A is greater than 3 and B is at least A.
1188000	1198000	And we manage to give a construction for every pair of AB, at least four.
1198000	1220000	So, if the construction goes like this, we take the primitive n root of unity, and we take the set of points in P1, which consists of points 11, 1u, 1u to the power, the second power and so on, up to 1 and u to the power n minus 1.
1220000	1243000	And now we construct the product of these points. So, we look at the points as row or columns vectors, we multiply them, and we get a 4 by 4 matrices by multiplying 1 by 1 every set, every point from A with every point from A.
1244000	1260000	And we write these matrices as row vectors. So, these are all the multiples of row vector matrices from A.
1260000	1278000	And we consider the set set to be the set of all these points plus, and we consider also two other sets of points, y1 and y2, which are sets of colina points.
1278000	1290000	The set x is on a quadric, it is a grid, and y and y1 are outside of this quadric.
1290000	1314000	And the theorem says that if n is a positive integer, which is at least three, then we have two options. If n is odd, then the set x plus y1 and the set x plus y2 are n times n plus 1 to 36.
1314000	1333000	And in case n is even, then also the set x plus y1 plus y2 is an n, n plus 2, the product set, and also the sets mentioned in the first part are the product sets.
1333000	1343000	And moreover, the sets constructed by the standard construction are not grids.
1344000	1367000	So, we are able to construct an AB, the property set, when A is at least three, for B equal A plus 1 and A odd, or for B equal A plus 2, or A plus 1 or A plus 2, and A even.
1367000	1378000	But we want to construct also the property sets when the factors, the A and B are different for more than two.
1378000	1392000	So we have this useful lemma, then if we have a property set, which contains a property subset, so we have an AB property set, and it contains a CB property subset, Z prime.
1392000	1405000	And a general projection of Z prime shares with the general projection of Z, a minimal generator of the grid B, the second number.
1405000	1417000	And the residual set, the B's, which is equal Z minus Z prime, is an A minus C, B, the property.
1417000	1432000	So this lemma allows us to construct the property sets, which are when the A and B are not different by one, but by more.
1432000	1451000	So as a corollary, we get that for every pair of positive integers, when A is at least four, at B is at least A, there exists a non-degraded and non-degenerate AB, the property set of points in B three.
1462000	1479000	So now I would like to tell you how this is linked to the weak left-hand property, and the link is via unexpected cones, so there will be a few words about unexpected cones, and then we come to weak left-hand.
1479000	1486000	And I have shown you the sets before and after.
1486000	1493000	These sets come from the root systems, and they are proved to have unexpected cones.
1493000	1501000	This is the paper of Harbour, Miljore, Nagel and Peitler, published in 2012.
1501000	1514000	And these sets are also non-trivial, the proteases, which are shown in the paper.
1514000	1527000	So the existence of the unexpected cones is equivalent to the filer of the weak left-hand property.
1527000	1544000	So if we denote the unexpected cone property by C of D, so this is the property of the existence of an unexpected hyper surface of degree D, and my PPCD.
1544000	1562000	And then, by Macaulay duality, sets Z satisfies C of D, if and only if the weak left-hand property fails in degree D minus one.
1562000	1579000	So we have a set of points, P1 to PR, and we have the dual linear forms, L1 to LR, and we have another point, and also the dual linear form to this point.
1579000	1589000	And then the failure of the weak left-hand property in degree D minus one means that this multiplication doesn't have the maximal rank,
1589000	1598000	which means that the cone is unexpected.
1598000	1614000	So now we may ask, because we know that these cones exist, for example, for D4, for F4, we may ask a question, do all the proteases set be failures of the weak left-hand property?
1614000	1632000	And this is open, so if there is a cone, an unexpected cone, we have the failure of weak left-hand property, but if not, we don't know if there are the proteases which don't have this unexpected one.
1632000	1650000	And this is how we come to half-grid, so all the sets we consider that were not degenerate and not grid were of the type that after projection we had some lines.
1650000	1656000	And this is what we call a half-grid, so it is a grid in one way.
1656000	1677000	So if we had a non-degenerate, non-grid, the protease set, we say that it is a half-grid, if its projection is the intersection of two curves, and exactly one of the curves can be taken as a union of lines.
1677000	1686000	So if both are the union of lines, that was the grid, and now we consider only one curve to be the union of lines.
1686000	1695000	And as we have seen, the D4 is a 3-4 half-grid, and it lies on four lines.
1695000	1706000	And also, all the protease sets obtained from the standard construction are half-grids.
1706000	1715000	And so we may ask a question, is every non-trivial D4 set a half-grid?
1715000	1726000	We don't have any general construction here, but we know three examples.
1726000	1743000	The first example is H4 configuration, which is a 6-10-13 set, and it was studied by Paulina Wichniewska and Maciej Ziemba in 2021.
1743000	1758000	So this configuration also comes from the root system, but the maximum number of points on the line is 5, so this set cannot be covered by 10 lines.
1758000	1778000	Also, there are two more examples, one of them is the general configuration, which is 5-8, the protease set, and the other is 10-12, the protease set, and the two last configurations are connected to quantum mechanics.
1778000	1790000	We don't know whether these examples are just the only ones or there exists some more. It will be interesting to first know this.
1790000	1809000	So this is an open question to decide whether there are other non-trivial non-half-grid D4 sets.
1809000	1819000	And if we don't know how to deal with non-trivial non-half-grid D4 sets, we may try to classify half-grids.
1819000	1829000	So how many non-projectively equivalent half-grids are there?
1829000	1844000	And we were studying this topic in the preprint from 2023, and the result is the classification of 4-4 half-grids.
1844000	1857000	So we assume that our set of points is a 4-4 half-grid in P3, and we discovered that there are two possibilities.
1857000	1869000	So the first one is the unharmonic case, and then in this case the points are S on the slide, and these are the coordinates of the points.
1869000	1874000	The epsilon is the primitive root of unit of order 6.
1874000	1888000	And to visualize, we can see that the points in the columns are in line, and also the last row is the row of columnar points.
1889000	1906000	So one possibility is that the four points lie on four, let's say vertical lines, and also the four plus points lie on a horizontal line.
1906000	1910000	And the second possibility is called the harmonic case.
1910000	1931000	The three points have coordinates on the slide, and the collinations are just the vertical ones, so the points in the columns are collinear, and there are no collinearities in the rows.
1931000	1940000	So this is done. I'm not going into details, I will just tell you some tools we are using.
1940000	1952000	So we consider permutations, which leave the cross-racial invariant. We have four points on each line, so we may say about the cross-racial of this point.
1952000	1965000	And we use the notation a, j, k, l is the permutation, which sends 1 to i, 2 to j, 3 to k, and 4 to l.
1965000	1970000	So this is not a cycle, that's why the commas between the numbers.
1970000	1999000	So with this notation, first it is well known that the cross-racial is invariant under the line group, so this means that with this notation, if sigma is one of the four permutations listed on the slide, then the cross-racial is invariant.
2000000	2016000	But these permutations are involuntary, but there are also two more cases, which leave the cross-racial invariant, and this is the harmonic and unharmonic case.
2017000	2034000	So in the harmonic case, the cross-racial is one of the numbers minus one, one-half and two, and then we have eight more permutations, which leave the cross-racial invariant.
2034000	2049000	And in the unharmonic case, we have 12 more permutations, which leave the cross-racial invariant.
2050000	2069000	So we study how the permutation of points on the cross-racial on points on one line is read as a permutation of points on the second line and so forth.
2069000	2085000	And also the proof uses the fact that if you have four lines in P3, and they are not on the quadric surface, then there are two transversals of these lines.
2085000	2106000	And also what is very useful is that we can use this result from previous considerations, so if you have four lines, and our half grid lies on these four lines, and we consider the set without one line,
2106000	2113000	and then our points form a 3-4 grid.
2113000	2115000	So how do we know it?
2115000	2134000	They could, the half grid is at the protist set, so if we take out a line, we get a 3-4 protist set, and there are two options, one is a grid, and the other is a default configuration, but the default configuration doesn't have four aligned points.
2134000	2154000	So this must be, and using this and considering how the permutations on, how the points on the line go to the points on another line using this cross-racial.
2154000	2169000	And then we get to the theorem that gives, that only this harmonic and unharmonic case, let me go back to this.
2169000	2188000	This harmonic and unharmonic case are half grids, which, so these are two different type of grids, which are not projectively equivalent, and these are the only possibilities for 4-4 half grids.
2188000	2193000	So what can we do now?
2193000	2207000	We can try to classify the four B half grids in P3, and here we also have these transversals, so we know how to start at least.
2207000	2222000	The open problem is to classify AB half grids, where A is at least 5, and B is greater or equal than 8.
2222000	2240000	So this is all, thank you, and I hope now you know that this logo is, the default configuration is somehow in this logo, and so you'll know why we are wearing these t-shirts. Thank you.
