00:00.000 --> 00:13.000
Thank you. First of all, I would like to thank the organizers for inviting me here, for letting me come here with Carolina, and for accepting the talk.

00:13.000 --> 00:24.000
So I'm going to speak about the joint project with Luca Chiantini, Giuseppe Favacchio, Brian Harvon, Juan Miore, Thomas Schenberg, and Justin Ashpond.

00:24.000 --> 00:36.000
And for short, I will call these polytools, because there are three Polish members to Italian and to US-based members.

00:37.000 --> 00:47.000
And this is our logo. See on my t-shirt, I guess Giuseppe also has the same t-shirt, but he didn't show me the talk.

00:47.000 --> 00:58.000
So the logo is not just a logo, it has some meaning. I hope it will be visible after my talk.

00:58.000 --> 01:08.000
And the talk is based on two preprints. The first one is the same as Giuseppe was talking about, but not chapter two, the rest of chapters.

01:08.000 --> 01:20.000
And the second is the new preprint from 2023. Both preprints are available at ARCH.

01:21.000 --> 01:27.000
So let me start with the definition of the property.

01:27.000 --> 01:41.000
So if we have a property p, whatever property you would like, and a finite set of points z in the projective space over the fields of complex numbers.

01:41.000 --> 01:57.000
I will drop this assumption. I won't write c in the next slides, but all the talk is for projective and dimensional space over c, or then three-dimensional space.

01:57.000 --> 02:17.000
And we say that a set c is a general projection from a general point to a hyperplane, which is isomorphic to pn-1, as the property p.

02:17.000 --> 02:26.000
So for example, we can think of the property p as being Gorinstein, and then we can speak of Gepro-Gorinstein sets.

02:26.000 --> 02:39.000
We can also say about p being a complete intersection, so ci, and that is how Gepro-T sets come from.

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
And there are lots of open problems connected with Gepro-P sets.

02:44.000 --> 02:55.000
So they are very open, and the first is given a certain property, classify Gepro-P sets in pn.

02:55.000 --> 03:03.000
So it is very, very general, and this is a starting open problem.

03:04.000 --> 03:18.000
You can consider a property like being Gorinstein, and then you can try to classify Gepro-Gorinstein sets in pn.

03:18.000 --> 03:26.000
You can note that Gepro-Gorinstein sets are Gepro-Gorinstein sets, but not the other way around.

03:26.000 --> 03:32.000
And you can also try to classify Gepro-T sets in pn.

03:32.000 --> 03:45.000
This is also very general, and in this talk I would like to say something about Gepro-T sets in p3, since we don't know any examples in pn.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
And we have some classifications in p3.

03:49.000 --> 03:57.000
So let's move to p3, and from now on everything is going on in p3.

03:57.000 --> 04:06.000
So we say that a finite set of points z is an ab Gepro-T set.

04:06.000 --> 04:14.000
If its general projection to a plane is an intersection of curves of degree a and b.

04:14.000 --> 04:30.000
So we have a set of points in p3, and we project this set from a general point to a general plane, and the result lies on the intersection of two curves of degree a and b.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
This is an ab Gepro-T set.

04:34.000 --> 04:41.000
And we call the set, the Gepro-T set, the generate if it is contained in a plane.

04:41.000 --> 04:47.000
So here you have two curves, these curves are of degree two.

04:47.000 --> 05:10.000
And our set z contains four points, the intersection points, and then if you take any point somewhere in the space p3, and you project to another plane, the images of these curves would be the curves whose intersection is the complete intersection.

05:10.000 --> 05:21.000
So this is a very simple example, and we don't want to speak about this kind of example.

05:22.000 --> 05:32.000
The question asked by Francesco Polizzi in 2011 was whether every Gepro-T set in p3 is degenerate.

05:32.000 --> 05:45.000
So is it true that all these sets are in fact sets contained in a plane and projected to another plane?

05:45.000 --> 06:00.000
So if we think about the answer, we may think about two curves in p3 intersecting, because in the plane it is what happens.

06:00.000 --> 06:10.000
We have two curves which intersect, and then we project, and the images of these curves would give this complete intersection.

06:10.000 --> 06:30.000
And the theorem of Dufida and Dias from 1986 says that if we have two smooth irreducible non-degenerate curves in p3 of degrees A and B, then the number of intersection points is bounded by this number.

06:31.000 --> 06:40.000
So it is A-1 times B-1 plus 1, so it is not even close to A times B.

06:40.000 --> 06:46.000
So this is not the way how we can construct the Gepro-T set.

06:46.000 --> 06:55.000
Let me mention also the second part of the theorem, the maximal value achieved if both curves are on the same quadric.

06:55.000 --> 07:04.000
I want to mention it because quadrics play a role here in this theorem.

07:04.000 --> 07:21.000
So as I have already said, the set of intersection points of two smooth irreducible non-degenerate curves in p3 of degrees A and B is not an A-B Gepro-T set.

07:21.000 --> 07:32.000
So we have to look for another method to construct or to give examples of such sets.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
Okay, so let me tell you what was the answer.

07:36.000 --> 07:46.000
The answer was given by Dmitry Panov in the same year, in 2009.

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
Let me recall the question was, is every Gepro-T set degenerate?

07:51.000 --> 07:57.000
So does the point lie on a surface already?

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
And Panov said, no, it is not true.

08:00.000 --> 08:08.000
So there are sets of points which are not on a surface and are Gepro-T, and these sets are called grids.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
So what is a grid?

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
Let me say what is an A-B grid.

08:15.000 --> 08:26.000
An A-B grid is a set of A times B points, which are of the form A intersected with B.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
So the intersection of two sets.

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
And the first set is the union of pairwise disjoint lines.

08:33.000 --> 08:40.000
And the second is the union of, let's say, more pairwise disjoint lines.

08:40.000 --> 08:50.000
So that each lines from the set A meet each line of the set B in exactly one point.

08:50.000 --> 08:58.000
So if we consider the sets in B3, we will just see on a simple example how it looks.

08:58.000 --> 09:05.000
I took it from Brian's presentation, so here we see a two or three grid.

09:05.000 --> 09:13.000
So one set of lines is black lines, and the other set is the orange lines.

09:13.000 --> 09:26.000
So these are two sets in B3 having six intersection points, and these six intersection points are called the grid.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
And why grids are Gepro-T sets?

09:30.000 --> 09:36.000
So let us see on the example.

09:36.000 --> 09:51.000
We have this grid in the space, and if we project from a general point in a space to a general hyperplane, then we get the black lines are projected.

09:51.000 --> 09:56.000
So black lines and the orange lines are projected to orange lines.

09:56.000 --> 10:04.000
Of course now the lines intersect, but this is not a problem because we look at the intersection point of the two curves.

10:04.000 --> 10:09.000
One curve is a black curve, and the other curve is the orange curve.

10:09.000 --> 10:17.000
So the black curve intersects with the orange curve in six points, and this is the complete intersection.

10:17.000 --> 10:28.000
So the grid above is a Gepro-T set, here it is a two or three Gepro-T.

10:28.000 --> 10:36.000
Okay, so we may now consider whether there are some other Gepro-T sets which are not the generative and not grids.

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
We will call these sets non-trivial.

10:40.000 --> 10:48.000
So trivial if they are the generative of grids, and now we are looking for non-trivial, a Gepro-T set.

10:48.000 --> 10:57.000
And the modified question of quality would look like this, is it true that every Gepro-T set in P3 is trivial?

10:57.000 --> 11:05.000
And if it's not trivial, is it possible to classify the Gepro-T sets at the productive equivalence?

11:05.000 --> 11:13.000
Maybe not all, maybe just for some small number of points.

11:13.000 --> 11:24.000
So let us look for, on the first example, this is the, the example is the D4 configuration.

11:24.000 --> 11:40.000
And it was studied by Alessandra Bernardi, Luca Piantini, Graham Benham, Giuseppe Favacchio, Brian Harbourn, Juan Miliore, Thomas Schenberg, and Justina Spahn during the previous lecture workshop in Meditaterme.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
So this configuration looks like this.

11:43.000 --> 11:53.000
We have, we have, let's think of a cube, so eight vertices.

11:53.000 --> 12:03.000
Here we have six vertices, and the, sorry, seven vertices, and the other one is hidden behind.

12:03.000 --> 12:17.000
So we take these eight vertices, then we add the vertices, which are the centers of perspectives of all the faces of the cube, and we add the middle point of the cube.

12:17.000 --> 12:29.000
So altogether, these are 12 points, and these, these 12 points form a D4 configuration.

12:29.000 --> 12:38.000
We may also give coordinates to the points, especially when somebody doesn't like to speak about the cube in the productive space.

12:38.000 --> 12:48.000
So this is a set of 12 points with such configuration, such coordinates, is the D4 configuration.

12:48.000 --> 13:04.000
And the D4 configuration lies on four disjoint lines, on different sets of four disjoint lines, let me tell you one set, so this is the set here on this slide.

13:04.000 --> 13:17.000
So, if we have this D4 configuration in P3, we can project to a plane from a general point.

13:17.000 --> 13:27.000
And then, of course, if we project collinear points, we get collinear points in P2, in the hyperplane to which we project.

13:27.000 --> 13:48.000
So, we may take the solid lines, this is one line, then the other line, and this line, these are the lines which cover nine points of the configuration.

13:48.000 --> 14:01.000
And there is also one more line which goes through the front vertex, the middle vertex, and the vertex in the back.

14:01.000 --> 14:17.000
So, if you project the black lines, go to black lines on the right-hand side, this line, which is not visible, the points are not visible, goes to the grey line.

14:17.000 --> 14:30.000
And because the points lie on a cone of D3, we have also the curve of D3 after projection.

14:30.000 --> 14:37.000
So, we can choose the lines differently, so we can choose, for example, the dashed line or the dotted line.

14:37.000 --> 14:53.000
So, there are more possibilities to choose the lines, but in any case, after the projection, the twelve sets lie on four lines and a cubic curve.

14:53.000 --> 14:59.000
So, this is a 3-4 Geoprote set on the bridge.

14:59.000 --> 15:16.000
And it is not agreed why it is not agreed, because we cannot take the curve of D3 to be three lines, because of the position.

15:16.000 --> 15:27.000
We have also another example, it's a four configuration, which I cannot draw, but I can give you the coordinates of the points.

15:27.000 --> 15:44.000
And this configuration consists of 24 points, so two times D4, the number of points in D4, and this is not the coincidence, because the points which are green here are exactly the points of D4 configuration.

15:44.000 --> 15:52.000
And the rest of the points are also D4 configuration, but not somewhere away.

15:52.000 --> 16:04.000
So, two D4 configuration grew up to an F4 configuration of 24 points, which lies on six disjoint lines.

16:04.000 --> 16:11.000
And it's not a 4-6 Geoprote set.

16:11.000 --> 16:22.000
And it is built up with 4-4 grid and on a quadric and two sets of four points which are aligned.

16:22.000 --> 16:30.000
So, in the case of D4, there was a 3-3 grid inside and a line outside.

16:30.000 --> 16:37.000
Now we have 4-4 grid and two lines outside of the bridge.

16:37.000 --> 16:51.000
And we may ask the question, for which pairs of positive integers, A and B, let's say that A is less or equal than B, does there exist a non-trivial Geoprote set?

16:51.000 --> 16:59.000
So, a set which is non-degenerate and it's not very quick.

16:59.000 --> 17:26.000
And we know the theorem from the paper of Gentini and Liora, published in 2021, that if we have a set of non-degenerate and non-degenerate A, B, Geoprote set, when both of A and B are at most three, then Z is a grid.

17:27.000 --> 17:41.000
So, the first, the smaller number of smaller numbers that can occur as A and B, for the set not to be a grid, maybe three and four.

17:41.000 --> 17:52.000
So, the question is to classify all three-four Geoprote sets into three.

17:52.000 --> 18:07.000
And we have a theorem in the preprint from 2022, that if a set Z is a non-degenerate 3B Geoprote set in B3, then there are two possibilities.

18:07.000 --> 18:14.000
The first one is that it is a 3B grid and B is any number.

18:14.000 --> 18:20.000
We assume just B is greater than 3.

18:20.000 --> 18:28.000
And the other option is that it is a D4 configuration, so a 3, 4 Geoprote.

18:28.000 --> 18:42.000
So, this means that there are no Geoprote sets, like 3B Geoprote sets for B greater than 4.

18:42.000 --> 19:00.000
And the proof goes through different cases, whether the points like are in general position, linear general position, or like on the twisted cubic, there are several cases which we consider.

19:00.000 --> 19:15.000
And we come to this result that if you have 3B Geoprote sets, that it must be a D4 or a 3B grid.

19:15.000 --> 19:33.000
So, we ask a question for which pair of integers A and B, which are both above 3, whether exist non-degenerate, non-grid AB Geoprote sets in B3.

19:33.000 --> 19:48.000
So, if you are given AB, can you construct an AB Geoprote set if this A is greater than 3 and B is at least A.

19:48.000 --> 19:58.000
And we manage to give a construction for every pair of AB, at least four.

19:58.000 --> 20:20.000
So, if the construction goes like this, we take the primitive n root of unity, and we take the set of points in P1, which consists of points 11, 1u, 1u to the power, the second power and so on, up to 1 and u to the power n minus 1.

20:20.000 --> 20:43.000
And now we construct the product of these points. So, we look at the points as row or columns vectors, we multiply them, and we get a 4 by 4 matrices by multiplying 1 by 1 every set, every point from A with every point from A.

20:44.000 --> 21:00.000
And we write these matrices as row vectors. So, these are all the multiples of row vector matrices from A.

21:00.000 --> 21:18.000
And we consider the set set to be the set of all these points plus, and we consider also two other sets of points, y1 and y2, which are sets of colina points.

21:18.000 --> 21:30.000
The set x is on a quadric, it is a grid, and y and y1 are outside of this quadric.

21:30.000 --> 21:54.000
And the theorem says that if n is a positive integer, which is at least three, then we have two options. If n is odd, then the set x plus y1 and the set x plus y2 are n times n plus 1 to 36.

21:54.000 --> 22:13.000
And in case n is even, then also the set x plus y1 plus y2 is an n, n plus 2, the product set, and also the sets mentioned in the first part are the product sets.

22:13.000 --> 22:23.000
And moreover, the sets constructed by the standard construction are not grids.

22:24.000 --> 22:47.000
So, we are able to construct an AB, the property set, when A is at least three, for B equal A plus 1 and A odd, or for B equal A plus 2, or A plus 1 or A plus 2, and A even.

22:47.000 --> 22:58.000
But we want to construct also the property sets when the factors, the A and B are different for more than two.

22:58.000 --> 23:12.000
So we have this useful lemma, then if we have a property set, which contains a property subset, so we have an AB property set, and it contains a CB property subset, Z prime.

23:12.000 --> 23:25.000
And a general projection of Z prime shares with the general projection of Z, a minimal generator of the grid B, the second number.

23:25.000 --> 23:37.000
And the residual set, the B's, which is equal Z minus Z prime, is an A minus C, B, the property.

23:37.000 --> 23:52.000
So this lemma allows us to construct the property sets, which are when the A and B are not different by one, but by more.

23:52.000 --> 24:11.000
So as a corollary, we get that for every pair of positive integers, when A is at least four, at B is at least A, there exists a non-degraded and non-degenerate AB, the property set of points in B three.

24:22.000 --> 24:39.000
So now I would like to tell you how this is linked to the weak left-hand property, and the link is via unexpected cones, so there will be a few words about unexpected cones, and then we come to weak left-hand.

24:39.000 --> 24:46.000
And I have shown you the sets before and after.

24:46.000 --> 24:53.000
These sets come from the root systems, and they are proved to have unexpected cones.

24:53.000 --> 25:01.000
This is the paper of Harbour, Miljore, Nagel and Peitler, published in 2012.

25:01.000 --> 25:14.000
And these sets are also non-trivial, the proteases, which are shown in the paper.

25:14.000 --> 25:27.000
So the existence of the unexpected cones is equivalent to the filer of the weak left-hand property.

25:27.000 --> 25:44.000
So if we denote the unexpected cone property by C of D, so this is the property of the existence of an unexpected hyper surface of degree D, and my PPCD.

25:44.000 --> 26:02.000
And then, by Macaulay duality, sets Z satisfies C of D, if and only if the weak left-hand property fails in degree D minus one.

26:02.000 --> 26:19.000
So we have a set of points, P1 to PR, and we have the dual linear forms, L1 to LR, and we have another point, and also the dual linear form to this point.

26:19.000 --> 26:29.000
And then the failure of the weak left-hand property in degree D minus one means that this multiplication doesn't have the maximal rank,

26:29.000 --> 26:38.000
which means that the cone is unexpected.

26:38.000 --> 26:54.000
So now we may ask, because we know that these cones exist, for example, for D4, for F4, we may ask a question, do all the proteases set be failures of the weak left-hand property?

26:54.000 --> 27:12.000
And this is open, so if there is a cone, an unexpected cone, we have the failure of weak left-hand property, but if not, we don't know if there are the proteases which don't have this unexpected one.

27:12.000 --> 27:30.000
And this is how we come to half-grid, so all the sets we consider that were not degenerate and not grid were of the type that after projection we had some lines.

27:30.000 --> 27:36.000
And this is what we call a half-grid, so it is a grid in one way.

27:36.000 --> 27:57.000
So if we had a non-degenerate, non-grid, the protease set, we say that it is a half-grid, if its projection is the intersection of two curves, and exactly one of the curves can be taken as a union of lines.

27:57.000 --> 28:06.000
So if both are the union of lines, that was the grid, and now we consider only one curve to be the union of lines.

28:06.000 --> 28:15.000
And as we have seen, the D4 is a 3-4 half-grid, and it lies on four lines.

28:15.000 --> 28:26.000
And also, all the protease sets obtained from the standard construction are half-grids.

28:26.000 --> 28:35.000
And so we may ask a question, is every non-trivial D4 set a half-grid?

28:35.000 --> 28:46.000
We don't have any general construction here, but we know three examples.

28:46.000 --> 29:03.000
The first example is H4 configuration, which is a 6-10-13 set, and it was studied by Paulina Wichniewska and Maciej Ziemba in 2021.

29:03.000 --> 29:18.000
So this configuration also comes from the root system, but the maximum number of points on the line is 5, so this set cannot be covered by 10 lines.

29:18.000 --> 29:38.000
Also, there are two more examples, one of them is the general configuration, which is 5-8, the protease set, and the other is 10-12, the protease set, and the two last configurations are connected to quantum mechanics.

29:38.000 --> 29:50.000
We don't know whether these examples are just the only ones or there exists some more. It will be interesting to first know this.

29:50.000 --> 30:09.000
So this is an open question to decide whether there are other non-trivial non-half-grid D4 sets.

30:09.000 --> 30:19.000
And if we don't know how to deal with non-trivial non-half-grid D4 sets, we may try to classify half-grids.

30:19.000 --> 30:29.000
So how many non-projectively equivalent half-grids are there?

30:29.000 --> 30:44.000
And we were studying this topic in the preprint from 2023, and the result is the classification of 4-4 half-grids.

30:44.000 --> 30:57.000
So we assume that our set of points is a 4-4 half-grid in P3, and we discovered that there are two possibilities.

30:57.000 --> 31:09.000
So the first one is the unharmonic case, and then in this case the points are S on the slide, and these are the coordinates of the points.

31:09.000 --> 31:14.000
The epsilon is the primitive root of unit of order 6.

31:14.000 --> 31:28.000
And to visualize, we can see that the points in the columns are in line, and also the last row is the row of columnar points.

31:29.000 --> 31:46.000
So one possibility is that the four points lie on four, let's say vertical lines, and also the four plus points lie on a horizontal line.

31:46.000 --> 31:50.000
And the second possibility is called the harmonic case.

31:50.000 --> 32:11.000
The three points have coordinates on the slide, and the collinations are just the vertical ones, so the points in the columns are collinear, and there are no collinearities in the rows.

32:11.000 --> 32:20.000
So this is done. I'm not going into details, I will just tell you some tools we are using.

32:20.000 --> 32:32.000
So we consider permutations, which leave the cross-racial invariant. We have four points on each line, so we may say about the cross-racial of this point.

32:32.000 --> 32:45.000
And we use the notation a, j, k, l is the permutation, which sends 1 to i, 2 to j, 3 to k, and 4 to l.

32:45.000 --> 32:50.000
So this is not a cycle, that's why the commas between the numbers.

32:50.000 --> 33:19.000
So with this notation, first it is well known that the cross-racial is invariant under the line group, so this means that with this notation, if sigma is one of the four permutations listed on the slide, then the cross-racial is invariant.

33:20.000 --> 33:36.000
But these permutations are involuntary, but there are also two more cases, which leave the cross-racial invariant, and this is the harmonic and unharmonic case.

33:37.000 --> 33:54.000
So in the harmonic case, the cross-racial is one of the numbers minus one, one-half and two, and then we have eight more permutations, which leave the cross-racial invariant.

33:54.000 --> 34:09.000
And in the unharmonic case, we have 12 more permutations, which leave the cross-racial invariant.

34:10.000 --> 34:29.000
So we study how the permutation of points on the cross-racial on points on one line is read as a permutation of points on the second line and so forth.

34:29.000 --> 34:45.000
And also the proof uses the fact that if you have four lines in P3, and they are not on the quadric surface, then there are two transversals of these lines.

34:45.000 --> 35:06.000
And also what is very useful is that we can use this result from previous considerations, so if you have four lines, and our half grid lies on these four lines, and we consider the set without one line,

35:06.000 --> 35:13.000
and then our points form a 3-4 grid.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
So how do we know it?

35:15.000 --> 35:34.000
They could, the half grid is at the protist set, so if we take out a line, we get a 3-4 protist set, and there are two options, one is a grid, and the other is a default configuration, but the default configuration doesn't have four aligned points.

35:34.000 --> 35:54.000
So this must be, and using this and considering how the permutations on, how the points on the line go to the points on another line using this cross-racial.

35:54.000 --> 36:09.000
And then we get to the theorem that gives, that only this harmonic and unharmonic case, let me go back to this.

36:09.000 --> 36:28.000
This harmonic and unharmonic case are half grids, which, so these are two different type of grids, which are not projectively equivalent, and these are the only possibilities for 4-4 half grids.

36:28.000 --> 36:33.000
So what can we do now?

36:33.000 --> 36:47.000
We can try to classify the four B half grids in P3, and here we also have these transversals, so we know how to start at least.

36:47.000 --> 37:02.000
The open problem is to classify AB half grids, where A is at least 5, and B is greater or equal than 8.

37:02.000 --> 37:20.000
So this is all, thank you, and I hope now you know that this logo is, the default configuration is somehow in this logo, and so you'll know why we are wearing these t-shirts. Thank you.
