00:00.000 --> 00:21.920
When the famous actors, musicians, and athletes of the 1980s wished to cement their place

00:21.920 --> 00:27.720
in American pop culture, they turned to celebrity photographer Harry Langdon.

00:27.720 --> 00:33.840
One by one, he would direct their gaze into the camera, with their heads backlit in a glowing halo.

00:33.840 --> 00:38.440
It was a look so many celebrities of the decade saw it, that one could hardly call

00:38.440 --> 00:45.080
themselves a star if they hadn't been photographed by Harry Langdon.

00:45.080 --> 00:51.720
But in 1984, a man named Dr. Frederick Lenz commissioned Langdon for a series of photoshoots.

00:51.720 --> 00:57.260
The glamour shots that resulted began to appear across California, on college campus poster

00:57.260 --> 01:03.100
boards, newspapers, and magazines, frequently filling up the entire printed page, but it

01:03.100 --> 01:12.340
was unclear who Dr. Frederick Lenz was.

01:12.340 --> 01:17.220
Some of his portraits would pose questions, others Dr. Lenz would devote to listing his

01:17.220 --> 01:22.420
past lives, where he'd been a Japanese Zen master and a Tibetan Lama.

01:22.420 --> 01:27.540
But his most widely circulated portrait would feature only his face, along with a simple

01:27.540 --> 01:46.860
call to action, meditate with Rama.

01:46.860 --> 01:52.940
Dr. Lenz seemed to appear out of nowhere, brute forcing his way into the public consciousness.

01:52.940 --> 01:58.260
To the casual observer, his visibility campaign seemed nothing more than an advertisement

01:58.260 --> 02:00.300
for meditation classes.

02:00.300 --> 02:05.340
But to his hundreds of already existing students, his face was meant to reach those who'd

02:05.340 --> 02:10.900
been followers of his for centuries, reminding them of who they really were, and calling

02:10.900 --> 02:14.500
them back to him in order to finish their liberation.

02:14.500 --> 02:20.460
We need to scour the globe for his students and reunite them, because we need to save

02:20.460 --> 02:24.020
the world from some unknown evil, or the evil of the world.

02:24.020 --> 02:28.780
For nearly two decades, Dr. Frederick Lenz would attempt to corral his followers and

02:28.780 --> 02:33.900
lead them across America, away from the critics and away from family and friends who were

02:33.900 --> 02:36.380
desperately trying to find them.

02:36.380 --> 02:41.900
Lenz was a clever liar, he was entertaining, he presented himself as successful, and this

02:41.900 --> 02:48.100
kind of loose Buddhism that he offered was appealing to a lot of young seekers that wanted

02:48.100 --> 02:50.580
to make money and be like him.

02:50.580 --> 02:55.660
In order to complete their liberation, each follower must master not only the disciplines

02:55.660 --> 03:04.060
of the ancient world, but prove their supremacy in the modern world by climbing to the top

03:04.060 --> 03:09.420
of America's most profitable industries, by any means necessary.

03:09.420 --> 03:13.140
Most of them didn't know anything about coding, sometimes they'd get caught, but on

03:13.140 --> 03:16.860
literal blacklist because they were destroying code.

03:16.860 --> 03:21.500
To find out what it was like to be inside, I spoke with a former follower who joined

03:21.500 --> 03:24.540
Lenz's organization when he was 20 years old.

03:24.540 --> 03:29.620
Like if you were to ask like how deep did I go, I looked forward to jumping in front

03:29.620 --> 03:31.900
of a bullet to save him.

03:31.900 --> 03:36.620
I looked forward to that, I was like I can't wait till his life is on the line, and I'm

03:36.620 --> 03:38.580
the one who gets to save him.

03:38.580 --> 03:43.860
And one of Lenz's most committed public detractors who threatened to take it all away from him.

03:43.860 --> 03:46.900
How many followers of Frederick Lenz did you attempt to deprogram?

03:46.900 --> 03:49.500
It had to be at least 25.

03:49.500 --> 03:52.340
How many of those would you say were successful?

03:52.340 --> 03:54.500
I think all but four.

03:54.500 --> 04:00.740
This is the story of Dr. Frederick Lenz, or as he was better known, Zenmaster Rama.

04:00.740 --> 04:06.380
It was a psychological, potentially arguable, physical abusive relationship with this guy.

04:06.380 --> 04:15.260
It was not as it was presented.

04:15.260 --> 04:17.780
I'm a teacher of enlightenment.

04:17.780 --> 04:21.060
That is to say, I'm enlightened.

04:21.060 --> 04:26.540
And I enjoy being a vehicle of the expressions of the universe.

04:26.540 --> 04:31.340
How did you happen to meet Frederick Lenz?

04:31.340 --> 04:37.620
It started in college, where I was in my senior year, and I saw on the walls of my college

04:37.620 --> 04:42.900
these beautiful, shiny posters about learn how to meditate from the Boston Meditation

04:42.900 --> 04:44.340
Society.

04:44.340 --> 04:50.740
So my fiance at the time and I went to one of these classes, and at first they talked

04:50.740 --> 04:54.980
a lot about what, you know, we meditate so we can find enlightenment.

04:54.980 --> 04:59.620
We can be calmer and more connected spiritually, and what historically those who have found

04:59.620 --> 05:05.980
enlightenment like true enlightenment look like in our historical art, this sort of golden

05:05.980 --> 05:08.420
glow in the paintings, right?

05:08.420 --> 05:12.300
And so some of us who are spiritually sensitive enough when you're around one of these enlightened

05:12.300 --> 05:16.820
beings, you can actually see the golden glow.

05:16.820 --> 05:17.820
And I'm kind of nerdy.

05:17.820 --> 05:22.020
So afterwards I would kind of go up and ask him questions and just say, you know, historically,

05:22.020 --> 05:24.660
what was it like with blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

05:24.660 --> 05:30.180
They were like, listen, we can tell that you are sort of, you vibe your aura or whatever

05:30.180 --> 05:33.220
vibrates higher than most people.

05:33.220 --> 05:35.900
You must have studied this in past lives.

05:35.900 --> 05:41.860
Listen, we follow one of these guys that we think we believe is enlightened.

05:41.860 --> 05:44.500
And we'd love you to check him out.

05:44.500 --> 05:50.900
There is going to be a $500 a plate dinner in New York, and they were going to pay for

05:50.900 --> 05:51.900
the whole thing.

05:51.900 --> 05:58.140
We're like, listen, you know, we've got so much from this guy we follow named Dr. Frederick

05:58.140 --> 06:00.420
Lenz or what we call is Rama.

06:00.420 --> 06:03.420
We've gotten so much from we want to give back and we make tons of money.

06:03.420 --> 06:09.260
So we're happy to pay your way and we were like, you know, cause we're like 20.

06:09.260 --> 06:11.380
We all drive down together.

06:11.380 --> 06:16.700
We go to this place and there's like 302 or 300 people there, all in tuxes and a lot

06:16.700 --> 06:21.180
of them are doctors and lawyers and computer programmers and computer programmers and computer

06:21.180 --> 06:25.140
programmers, which I noticed sort of a pattern in all of that.

06:25.140 --> 06:30.460
And then this tall guy who has sort of like blondish curly hair, kind of like this, but

06:30.460 --> 06:31.460
bigger.

06:31.460 --> 06:36.100
At some point I saw him in like a leather jacket and like, you know, Ray Bands and

06:36.100 --> 06:40.060
he did like a five minute monologue standup routine.

06:40.060 --> 06:47.460
Now, in other words, meditation has been turned into a tool of the bourgeoisie.

06:47.460 --> 06:50.460
No, I'm sorry.

06:50.740 --> 06:54.300
Wrong incarnation.

06:54.300 --> 06:58.340
I get, you know, I'm in different ones at different times and I got to bring it around

06:58.340 --> 06:59.340
and get it straight.

06:59.340 --> 07:00.340
Sorry.

07:00.340 --> 07:02.980
So this is the, this is the right America.

07:02.980 --> 07:07.180
And then he said, okay, everybody, let's, we're going to dim the lights and let's meditate

07:07.180 --> 07:09.620
for those who haven't been with me before.

07:09.620 --> 07:11.300
Don't close your eyes like you usually do.

07:11.300 --> 07:16.780
Just like have a soft focus on me and open your eyes a little bit and watch me meditate.

07:16.780 --> 07:18.420
You're not just watching me, the body.

07:18.420 --> 07:20.580
You're watching the energy fields here.

07:20.580 --> 07:23.580
You're relaxing your eyes, not looking too sharply, gazing.

07:23.580 --> 07:25.780
I'm just watching.

07:25.780 --> 07:27.900
You know, he just closed his eyes and he was doing a thing.

07:27.900 --> 07:29.300
I don't remember.

07:29.300 --> 07:36.820
And within 30 seconds or a minute, the whole room glowed gold and I got this wave of euphoria

07:36.820 --> 07:40.660
that I never experienced before.

07:40.660 --> 07:49.540
I was like, oh my God, if this dude can do that as an enlightened being in minutes, I'm

07:49.540 --> 07:54.900
in for life.

07:54.900 --> 08:01.740
This man can turn a room gold in 60 seconds, red one of lenses Bay Area advertisements.

08:01.740 --> 08:03.980
Imagine what he can do to you.

08:03.980 --> 08:06.740
It's a claim that would be echoed for years.

08:06.740 --> 08:07.740
Turns the room gold.

08:07.740 --> 08:08.740
That's all you see is gold light.

08:09.180 --> 08:12.540
Kind of like if you looked into the sun and squirt.

08:12.540 --> 08:17.020
Even decades later, it's difficult to find discussion of Frederick lens without someone

08:17.020 --> 08:20.060
mentioning the golden light.

08:20.060 --> 08:23.460
But not everyone had such a theatrical introduction.

08:23.460 --> 08:25.940
What was it then Annie that made you go, wow?

08:25.940 --> 08:30.300
Well, first of all, I didn't go, wow.

08:30.300 --> 08:31.780
I listened to his presentation.

08:31.780 --> 08:32.940
I thought he was witty.

08:32.940 --> 08:35.660
I thought he was a nice person.

08:35.660 --> 08:38.340
And I resonated with things he said that he said, let's meditate.

08:38.340 --> 08:39.340
And I had a good meditation.

08:39.340 --> 08:41.420
I had a very good meditation.

08:41.420 --> 08:47.460
Dr. Lenz's brand of meditation was not unlike what was already beginning to catch on in

08:47.460 --> 08:52.860
the West with the goal of achieving better focus and control over one's emotions by

08:52.860 --> 08:54.780
quieting the mind.

08:54.780 --> 08:56.940
Our mind is always in motion.

08:56.940 --> 08:59.020
You'll notice you're always thinking something.

08:59.020 --> 09:03.900
You're worried about tomorrow, paying the bills, we're thinking, images are flashing

09:03.900 --> 09:08.060
through our mind, seeing somebody you'd like to see, remembering something that happened

09:08.060 --> 09:14.940
in the past, our desires, our feelings, feeling guilty, feeling expectation.

09:14.940 --> 09:18.560
Meditation is the opposite of that.

09:18.560 --> 09:21.060
The basic technique is learned in seconds.

09:21.060 --> 09:25.580
A student focuses their attention on the rise and fall of their breath or a place on their

09:25.580 --> 09:27.020
body.

09:27.020 --> 09:32.260
Keeping eyes closed is common, although Lenz often asked his students to look in his direction,

09:32.260 --> 09:34.980
a technique he called gazing.

09:34.980 --> 09:39.380
And when random thoughts intrude, the student gently brings their attention back to the

09:39.380 --> 09:40.900
focal point.

09:40.900 --> 09:46.700
I would wake up at like six in the morning, which I'd never done in my entire life.

09:46.700 --> 09:49.660
And I would immediately meditate for 45 minutes.

09:49.660 --> 09:51.620
I was so motivated and focused.

09:51.620 --> 09:58.740
I was a 4.0 student for my last semester out of being a B minus student forever.

09:58.740 --> 10:02.340
I would like to teach you to look into the depths of yourself, and I'm afraid you're

10:02.340 --> 10:03.340
going to be shocked.

10:03.340 --> 10:06.020
You're going to find out that you're much more beautiful than you realize.

10:06.020 --> 10:07.980
I suddenly started loving running.

10:07.980 --> 10:10.620
And so I would go for a run for two or three miles.

10:10.620 --> 10:11.620
I'd come back.

10:11.620 --> 10:15.380
If I didn't have school that day, I would work hard at work at friendly scooping ice

10:15.380 --> 10:18.780
cream, but being super focused and being like the best I can be.

10:18.780 --> 10:23.780
And that you can be happy even in the most adverse circumstances if you can do this one

10:23.780 --> 10:28.620
thing, learn to make your mind quiet, still your thoughts.

10:28.620 --> 10:33.180
Oh, and a lot of times I would meditate late at night and find that I really didn't need

10:33.180 --> 10:38.260
a lot of sleep, so I'd be working extra hard reading books that he suggested I read on

10:38.260 --> 10:40.020
top of all of my homework.

10:40.020 --> 10:47.300
Because then it's as if a curtain opens, and behind that curtain is light, ecstasy, perfection,

10:47.300 --> 10:49.140
beauty, and reality.

10:49.140 --> 10:50.900
There's nothing to be afraid of.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.220
There's only life.

10:52.220 --> 10:53.860
And we all live forever.

10:53.860 --> 10:57.580
So it's hard for someone to go, I think you're in something destructive because it doesn't

10:57.580 --> 11:03.380
look that way in the beginning.

11:03.380 --> 11:09.420
But in 1989, a computer programmer from Oregon named Brenda Kerber, who'd been a meditation

11:09.420 --> 11:14.180
student of lenses for the past three years, went missing.

11:14.180 --> 11:18.740
Others would disappear soon after, as well as students cutting off contact with their

11:18.740 --> 11:22.940
families after they began attending lenses workshops.

11:22.940 --> 11:27.660
This even surfaced of students giving up custody of their children in order to follow

11:27.660 --> 11:30.500
the meditation group across the country.

11:30.500 --> 11:33.500
My fiance and I, we lived together.

11:33.500 --> 11:37.380
We went to Boston to meet with one of the inner circle.

11:37.380 --> 11:42.460
And we had a dinner with him, and he talked about relationships and energy and stuff like

11:42.460 --> 11:43.460
that.

11:43.460 --> 11:47.620
And on the way home, we spontaneously, the both of us at the same time, realized we

11:47.620 --> 11:53.580
shouldn't be together, because it's such a drain on our path to enlightenment.

11:53.580 --> 11:57.980
And we talked about with glee, how we were going to split up all the stuff that we owned.

11:57.980 --> 12:02.380
It's like, oh, you can get the CD, those CDs, and these CDs will be mine and those books

12:02.380 --> 12:03.380
and my book.

12:03.380 --> 12:04.380
It's like, do you want the better?

12:04.380 --> 12:05.380
Do you want the couch?

12:05.380 --> 12:06.820
She's like, I'll take the couch.

12:06.820 --> 12:10.580
And then a few days later, and she was like, I don't want to leave, you know, I really

12:10.580 --> 12:11.940
love you and I want to stay together.

12:11.940 --> 12:14.300
And I was like, oh, you're so silly.

12:14.300 --> 12:16.580
It's just going to destroy us.

12:16.580 --> 12:33.460
So who was Dr. Frederick Lenz?

12:33.460 --> 12:39.780
Frederick Lenz dedicated his first book titled Lifetimes, True Accounts of Reincarnation,

12:39.780 --> 12:42.660
to an individual named Sri Chenmue.

12:42.660 --> 12:48.020
In Lenz's second book, Sri Chenmue received not only the dedication, but credit for the

12:48.020 --> 12:53.860
ideas presented in the book itself, disclosing that Lenz had been a student of Chenmue's

12:53.860 --> 12:55.980
for the past 10 years.

12:55.980 --> 13:00.100
Sri Chenmue continues to astound with his Hakeulian feats of strength.

13:00.100 --> 13:04.580
A guru, a genuine guru, really genuine Sri Chenmue.

13:04.580 --> 13:08.940
Sri Chenmue is our next guest on the program, and he is the holder of the United Nations

13:08.940 --> 13:13.180
Medallion for Peace.

13:13.180 --> 13:18.820
In 1970s Queens, New York, there were few local figures that baffled the media quite like

13:18.820 --> 13:24.740
Chenmue Kumar Ghosh, who'd adopted the honorific title of Sri before leaving Bangladesh for

13:24.740 --> 13:26.860
the United States.

13:26.860 --> 13:31.700
After settling into Queens, Chenmue began putting his face on posters around college

13:31.700 --> 13:35.900
campuses, offering free meditation classes to the public.

13:35.900 --> 13:41.460
His following is nearly always described as increasing, and by the mid-70s, reporters

13:41.460 --> 13:47.020
found that he'd accumulated hundreds of students, most of whom were college-aged.

13:47.020 --> 13:53.540
Little by little, as we meditate every day and we see him twice a week, we notice, or

13:53.540 --> 14:02.340
I notice, that I'm so happy and I feel God's presence so much of the time.

14:02.500 --> 14:07.380
Chenmue attempted to be a living example of what a focused mind, conditioned by frequent

14:07.380 --> 14:12.700
meditation, was capable of, and would invite local press to witness and perform endurance

14:12.700 --> 14:17.020
challenges, which he called creative miracles.

14:17.020 --> 14:23.980
The first was a 24-hour writing session where he produced 843 poems.

14:23.980 --> 14:30.980
This works out to about 35 poems per hour, or a poem every 100 seconds.

14:41.860 --> 14:45.820
We just don't know if there is a world's record for the number of paintings done in

14:45.820 --> 14:50.820
the shortest possible time, but on tonight's edition of Bert Haney's People, he made just

14:50.820 --> 14:54.300
a found that man a guru living in Queens.

14:54.300 --> 15:01.500
The pace of his second challenge was more frantic, 16,000 paintings in 24 hours, averaging

15:01.500 --> 15:04.260
now only a few seconds per piece.

15:04.260 --> 15:09.420
I had no preconceived idea as to what I'm going to paint.

15:09.420 --> 15:15.140
I just allow myself to be carried away by a higher force.

15:15.140 --> 15:20.580
It's hard labor as well as an act of love, remarkable.

15:20.580 --> 15:25.180
Through meditation, Chenmue claimed to have achieved what he called a oneness with the

15:25.180 --> 15:31.020
Supreme, a type of psychedelic state he was known to spontaneously slip in and out of at

15:31.020 --> 15:32.660
all times of the day.

15:32.660 --> 15:38.860
I noticed as you were meditating, there was rapid eye movement on your part.

15:38.860 --> 15:45.860
My consciousness was flying from one plane of reality to another.

15:45.860 --> 15:51.300
This facial expression Chenmue adopted became the focal point of his group meditations,

15:51.300 --> 15:55.540
with students staring into the flickering whites of his eyes as they cleared their minds

15:55.540 --> 15:56.540
of thought.

15:56.540 --> 16:03.380
Treat Chenmue as like a visitor from this other world to this world to show his followers

16:03.380 --> 16:05.500
how to reach this other world.

16:05.500 --> 16:11.700
At home, students would substitute with a photograph, as instructed by his 1978 meditation

16:11.700 --> 16:12.700
manual.

16:12.700 --> 16:17.620
Quote, the best type of meditation comes when you enter into my consciousness by looking

16:17.620 --> 16:22.820
at a picture taken of me when I am in a high meditative consciousness, when I am one with

16:22.820 --> 16:24.220
the Supreme.

16:24.220 --> 16:47.980
Do not think of it as a picture of a human being.

16:47.980 --> 16:52.580
Chenmue would soon have enough of a following to pack out event rooms, where he would take

16:52.580 --> 16:58.740
the stage, establish a oneness with the Supreme, and then deliver, to a crowd of thousands,

16:58.740 --> 17:15.740
a new creative miracle.

17:15.740 --> 17:21.340
In a single performance, Chenmue would sometimes cycle through a hundred or more instruments,

17:21.340 --> 17:26.620
improvising melodies with each one just long enough to channel the Supreme, before moving

17:26.620 --> 17:40.380
on to the next.

17:40.380 --> 17:47.140
By the late 1970s, Chenmue's multi-sensory meditation experience had extended far beyond

17:47.140 --> 17:48.140
Queens, New York.

17:48.300 --> 17:53.020
There are over 125 Sri Chim Noi centers around the world.

17:53.020 --> 17:54.020
What goes on in them?

17:54.020 --> 17:56.500
What happens in the centers?

17:56.500 --> 18:01.620
My students all over the world, wherever there are centers, they play and meditate, and they

18:01.620 --> 18:27.180
read my writings, and also, as you know, I have composed thousands of songs.

18:27.180 --> 18:31.780
Much of Chenmue's success was owed to the recruitment efforts of his students, and old

18:31.780 --> 18:36.580
newspaper classified show that Frederick Len spent much of his early career as a traveling

18:36.580 --> 18:52.900
meditation instructor, leading workshops on behalf of the Sri Chenmue centers.

18:52.900 --> 18:58.260
He went by Atmananda, one of the Sanskrit nicknames that Chenmue had given to all of

18:58.260 --> 18:59.940
those in his inner circle.

18:59.940 --> 19:04.620
I decided to study with Sri Chenmue through Atmananda.

19:04.620 --> 19:08.660
He was the number one disciple-bringer for Chenmue around the world.

19:08.660 --> 19:09.660
He was very good at it.

19:09.660 --> 19:10.660
He was a brilliant speaker.

19:10.660 --> 19:13.660
Oh yeah, there's a definite battle between the light and the dark.

19:13.660 --> 19:14.860
The network always wins, though.

19:14.860 --> 19:15.860
We run the galaxy.

19:16.860 --> 19:23.220
What was he a professor of, and where was he professing?

19:23.220 --> 19:29.460
He was a professor of American literature at State University of New York at Stonybrook.

19:29.460 --> 19:35.340
So I can only suggest that you learn to be what my friend Theodor Rutke called a perpetual

19:35.340 --> 19:41.980
beginner, because if you feel that you're knowledgeable, you may be.

19:41.980 --> 19:45.660
But to be a perpetual beginner is the happy part.

19:45.660 --> 19:49.020
Being a student is much more fun than being a teacher.

19:49.020 --> 19:54.540
Len's experience as a professor gave him a natural ease and authority over his college-aged

19:54.540 --> 19:56.060
audience members.

19:56.060 --> 20:01.780
And as he traveled the country gathering recruits, he began to realize an opportunity.

20:01.780 --> 20:06.340
He would give a lecture for Chenmue to recruit people into Chenmue's circles.

20:06.340 --> 20:11.700
At the very end, he'd be up there sitting cross-legged on the table, and he was channeling

20:11.820 --> 20:15.460
the guru's spiritual light.

20:15.460 --> 20:21.060
And he would look at people, and spiritual light would come out of his eyes, he would

20:21.060 --> 20:22.060
say.

20:22.060 --> 20:26.860
Well, that's a big no-no, because that is up for the big kahuna to do, not for the little

20:26.860 --> 20:29.260
tiny atmananda to do.

20:29.260 --> 20:35.740
And by 1980, Len's workshops were no longer associated with the Shri Chenmue centers,

20:35.740 --> 20:38.520
but sponsored by his own organization.

20:38.520 --> 20:44.440
He took off with a handful of other Shri Chenmue followers, convincing them that he was the

20:44.440 --> 20:47.500
one and the master has kind of fallen.

20:47.500 --> 20:51.720
As I grew up spiritually, as I entered into enlightenment, I saw the limitations of my

20:51.720 --> 20:56.460
own teacher who was a very powerful occultist, but who I thought was, to some extent, limiting

20:56.460 --> 20:58.480
others in their spiritual growth.

20:58.480 --> 21:02.000
Come with me, I'm the new enlightened one.

21:02.000 --> 21:06.400
It wouldn't be easy for Len's to rise out of Shri Chenmue's shadow.

21:06.400 --> 21:11.600
Not only did Chenmue have the adoration of thousands, he'd been hosting weekly meditations

21:11.600 --> 21:14.160
at the United Nations headquarters.

21:14.160 --> 21:18.560
Every Tuesday, his students could watch him slip into the supreme in front of some of the

21:18.560 --> 21:21.400
most influential people in the world.

21:21.400 --> 21:26.180
In order to take followers away from Chenmue, Len's would need to establish himself as

21:26.180 --> 21:29.120
a guru of greater merit.

21:29.120 --> 21:32.600
What did Frederick Len say he was offering his students?

21:32.600 --> 21:37.160
So he was offering his students spiritual energy.

21:37.160 --> 21:42.640
At a certain point, I came to learn that we had studied with him specifically for hundreds

21:42.640 --> 21:49.880
or thousands of lifetimes, and we've all grown towards enlightenment because of working

21:49.880 --> 21:50.880
with him.

21:50.880 --> 21:55.920
And so what he was offering his students was spiritual energy.

21:55.920 --> 22:00.160
When I sit with my students and meditate with them, I channel the Kundalini, the energy,

22:00.160 --> 22:01.160
directly into them.

22:01.160 --> 22:03.960
I bring them through plane after plane of consciousness.

22:03.960 --> 22:07.840
What they would do in a hundred years of meditation, I can do in an hour with them.

22:07.840 --> 22:08.920
This was the spiel.

22:08.920 --> 22:11.420
He'd give us spiritual energy.

22:11.420 --> 22:15.360
We would go home with that spiritual energy and meditate better.

22:15.360 --> 22:17.760
And I take the Kundalini and I play against the notes with it.

22:17.760 --> 22:20.920
I kind of do a light show inwardly and outwardly.

22:20.920 --> 22:24.920
With the energy, with vortexes of energy, as you sit there, opening you up, opening up

22:24.920 --> 22:29.160
different parts of you that maybe you haven't felt since you were a child, it's no big deal.

22:29.160 --> 22:30.720
It's just what I do.

22:30.760 --> 22:35.360
And when Lenz announced his separation from Chenmoy, it's reported that he was able

22:35.360 --> 22:40.420
to siphon about 40% of the students in attendance.

22:40.420 --> 22:46.320
But even without his star recruiter, Chenmoy's following only increased throughout the 1980s,

22:46.320 --> 22:50.640
and his students were beginning to perform creative miracles of their own.

22:50.640 --> 22:57.600
In 1986, the world record for most consecutive underwater pogo stick jumps was surpassed.

22:57.600 --> 23:03.360
The new champion used his platform as an opportunity to promote the three Chenmoy centers.

23:03.360 --> 23:07.880
Elsewhere in New York, a student shattered the record for continuous hand clapping with

23:07.880 --> 23:11.040
50 hours of non-stop applause.

23:11.040 --> 23:15.040
And he did so, he said, to honor his guru.

23:15.040 --> 23:22.440
By 1982, Chenmoy claimed to have completed over 140,000 paintings, as well as over 4,000

23:22.440 --> 23:31.240
musical compositions.

23:31.240 --> 23:35.080
Lenz would need his own way of showing the fruits of his enlightenment.

23:35.080 --> 23:40.520
Now, I have written a number of pieces of music to meditate to.

23:40.520 --> 23:44.520
I asked the Zen master, what is dancing?

23:44.520 --> 23:46.520
Dancing.

23:46.520 --> 23:48.520
Dancing.

23:48.520 --> 23:50.520
Dancing.

23:50.600 --> 23:56.600
Lenz was Lenz's rock, new age band.

23:56.600 --> 23:59.800
And he was credited as writing all the songs.

23:59.800 --> 24:02.200
And I would listen to them all the time.

24:02.200 --> 24:03.400
All the time.

24:03.400 --> 24:06.200
I mean all the time.

24:06.200 --> 24:08.600
It is moving to the right.

24:08.600 --> 24:11.960
Lenz was joined by three of his students to form Zazen.

24:11.960 --> 24:16.600
And throughout the 1980s, they produced a number of albums with tracks like

24:16.600 --> 24:19.800
Death is Sexual and Gandalf the Wizard.

24:19.800 --> 24:24.280
I loved listening to it, but I was, you know, controlled to love listening to it.

24:24.280 --> 24:25.640
It was actually fine music.

24:25.640 --> 24:26.680
It was perfectly good.

24:26.680 --> 24:29.160
This music is composed in other dimensions.

24:29.160 --> 24:30.760
That's where I go to compose it.

24:30.760 --> 24:33.800
And then it's brought here into this world from the planes of light.

24:33.800 --> 24:35.880
And it's played by some of my students.

24:35.880 --> 24:40.600
Chenmoy had become well-known for drawing talented musicians into his orbit.

24:40.600 --> 24:45.960
Guitarist Carlos Santana and John McLaughlin both spent much of their early careers making

24:45.960 --> 24:48.440
music dedicated to the Supreme.

24:48.520 --> 24:54.040
Zazen was stacked with talent as well, with Grammy-nominated Joaquin Lievenow providing

24:54.040 --> 24:55.160
lead guitar.

24:55.160 --> 24:58.840
And Lenz would incorporate this music into his live workshops,

24:58.840 --> 25:02.520
often using it as a focal point for group meditations.

25:02.520 --> 25:05.240
And I go through the music that they've played with my aura.

25:05.240 --> 25:06.840
We'll wash out anything impure.

25:06.840 --> 25:08.680
So there's only light in the music.

25:08.680 --> 25:10.120
It's perfect music.

25:10.120 --> 25:13.880
Students were asked to demonstrate their spiritual growth as well.

25:13.880 --> 25:19.640
Lenz required the submission of essays, detailing each student's progress in their twice daily

25:19.640 --> 25:25.960
meditations and several supplementary disciplines such as the reading and re-reading of recommended

25:25.960 --> 25:29.960
books and martial arts taught by Sensei Lenz himself.

25:29.960 --> 25:32.920
Martial arts is an ancient science.

25:32.920 --> 25:35.400
It was codified by Buddhist monks.

25:35.400 --> 25:40.440
He would wear a gi, you know, the karate white gi with a black belt.

25:40.520 --> 25:43.000
And they both looked like they had just come out of the package.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.240
They still had the folds all over them and stuff like that.

25:45.240 --> 25:49.080
I will be extending an invisible energy field that we call the key

25:49.080 --> 25:51.880
that we gain from deep meditation and samadhi.

25:56.920 --> 25:59.240
This has rarely been seen outside of the Orient.

26:02.120 --> 26:03.480
There's nothing she can do.

26:03.480 --> 26:04.600
Is there anything you can do?

26:04.600 --> 26:07.400
His inner circle would run at him and he'd go,

26:07.400 --> 26:09.880
huh, like that with his hands and then they'd fall down.

26:09.880 --> 26:12.920
What I want to do is interfere with their minds.

26:13.480 --> 26:15.480
The mind is the ultimate weapon.

26:15.480 --> 26:19.160
So they're going to come at me and I'm just going to project a wave of energy out of my body

26:19.160 --> 26:20.040
to disable them.

26:20.040 --> 26:20.680
Right?

26:20.680 --> 26:20.920
Good.

26:20.920 --> 26:21.080
Okay.

26:21.080 --> 26:21.960
Come at me.

26:21.960 --> 26:22.520
Come.

26:22.520 --> 26:22.840
Say.

26:25.960 --> 26:26.600
One more time.

26:26.600 --> 26:27.480
Come at me.

26:27.480 --> 26:28.040
Come.

26:28.040 --> 26:28.520
Say.

26:32.520 --> 26:35.640
For a moment, a wave of energy sweeps through their body

26:35.640 --> 26:37.000
and they don't know where they are.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
What world they're in, what dimension they're in.

26:39.480 --> 26:40.680
It's embarrassing.

26:40.680 --> 26:41.880
It's cringy.

26:41.880 --> 26:42.200
Right?

26:42.200 --> 26:43.320
How bad it was.

26:43.320 --> 26:46.040
But man, did it look good when I was under mind control.

26:46.040 --> 26:46.760
Holy shit.

26:46.760 --> 26:47.640
That guy could move.

26:48.440 --> 26:51.560
Len seemed to take the strictness of routine from Chen Moy

26:51.560 --> 26:55.800
who frequently enrolled his students in marathons to advertise the center

26:55.800 --> 27:00.680
and was known for waking his students up at 3 a.m. for morning meditations.

27:00.680 --> 27:04.920
But Len's took what he called a Western-oriented approach to enlightenment.

27:04.920 --> 27:09.400
If students weren't progressing in their careers and increasing their salaries,

27:09.400 --> 27:12.360
they weren't making full use of his spiritual energy.

27:19.560 --> 27:23.000
In this modern world, the more money you make,

27:23.000 --> 27:25.880
it's the better meditation you're having.

27:25.880 --> 27:30.920
It's difficult to find a consistent membership price for Len's meditation group.

27:30.920 --> 27:36.920
The introductory seminars are usually advertised as either free or for a small cover charge.

27:36.920 --> 27:38.920
But as attendees became regulars,

27:38.920 --> 27:44.760
tuition could range anywhere from $600 a month to $2,500 a month.

27:44.760 --> 27:46.360
I believe it was $20 a month.

27:46.360 --> 27:46.840
Really?

27:46.840 --> 27:47.400
Yeah.

27:47.400 --> 27:48.600
Is that what you pay?

27:48.600 --> 27:49.240
No.

27:49.240 --> 27:51.640
Since then, my career has advanced significantly

27:51.640 --> 27:53.960
and I pay approximately $1,000 a month now.

27:53.960 --> 27:58.360
For me, it started free and then it was like a sliding scale.

27:58.360 --> 28:03.880
Like if you could pay $100 a month, $500 a month, that would be helpful.

28:03.880 --> 28:08.760
And it got to the point where I might have been paying $3 or $500 a month scrambling.

28:08.760 --> 28:13.960
To cover the ever-increasing tuition, students were encouraged to switch careers.

28:13.960 --> 28:19.320
And at Len's's suggestion, many of them turned to the fledgling field of computer programming.

28:19.320 --> 28:23.720
A person who meditates who becomes a programmer is kind of like a duck in a happy pond.

28:24.680 --> 28:28.120
You're in the right situation for many, many reasons.

28:28.120 --> 28:34.920
He believed or he taught that computer programming was very similar to really good meditation

28:34.920 --> 28:36.760
because of where your brain goes.

28:36.760 --> 28:42.280
Computers are fascinating because the mindset necessary to work with advanced structures

28:42.280 --> 28:47.000
in programming and in design is exactly what we do in advanced meditation.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.760
It's exactly the same mindset.

28:48.840 --> 28:55.720
I had credit cards at age 20, 21 that I was maxing out because of the promise of,

28:55.720 --> 28:58.280
just in a few months, you're going to be making $100,000 a year,

28:58.280 --> 29:01.000
which was an unbelievable amount of money back then.

29:01.000 --> 29:05.480
According to ex-followers, Len's told his students that they'd all been software

29:05.480 --> 29:10.280
developers together in past lives in the lost city of Atlantis.

29:10.280 --> 29:13.960
And he appears to have registered a corporation under the title

29:13.960 --> 29:18.920
High Priest of the First Diocese of the Californian Church of Atlantis.

29:18.920 --> 29:21.880
The computers in Atlantis were infinitely evolved.

29:21.880 --> 29:25.400
All processing was done with light. Electricity's much too slow.

29:25.400 --> 29:30.600
But if his students had known how to code thousands of years ago, they would need a refresher.

29:30.600 --> 29:34.520
If you're not familiar with the world of programming, you might take a simple course in it,

29:34.520 --> 29:36.200
and then there are two ways to plunge into it.

29:36.200 --> 29:40.440
One is to go to a short-term computer school where you go for six months or nine months or a year,

29:40.440 --> 29:42.760
either during the day full-time or in the evening.

29:42.760 --> 29:46.440
He talked a lot about the importance of programming computers and artificial

29:46.440 --> 29:51.480
intelligence and relational databases, which is like a three- or four-D

29:51.480 --> 29:53.880
database instead of like a flat spreadsheet, right?

29:53.880 --> 29:56.840
I'm a nerd, so I kind of understood it, and there were lots of people who were like,

29:56.840 --> 30:00.040
I don't know what he's saying, but they like worked really hard to figure it out.

30:00.040 --> 30:02.920
Was Len's knowledgeable about computer programming?

30:02.920 --> 30:05.480
As far as I know, he was like a Steve Jobs.

30:05.480 --> 30:10.040
He understood the root of mentoring stuff, but he was just trying to inspire people

30:10.120 --> 30:12.680
to go out and make a great deal of money.

30:12.680 --> 30:14.840
Obviously, it's a smart career choice.

30:14.840 --> 30:19.480
It's our country's number one business now, and it will only become more so.

30:19.480 --> 30:24.440
But not every student waited until they knew how to code before entering the field.

30:24.440 --> 30:29.800
A pattern began to form of students packing out their resumes with proficiencies and programming

30:29.800 --> 30:34.760
languages, enlisting one another as previous employers who would vouch for them.

30:34.760 --> 30:38.440
If you don't have experience, come up with the names of some companies.

30:38.440 --> 30:42.520
Then you have somebody say, yes, they worked for me there, a friend.

30:42.520 --> 30:46.200
Most of them didn't know anything about coding, and they would use each other

30:46.200 --> 30:52.280
as references onto their resume and list all of the computer programming jobs they've had,

30:52.280 --> 30:53.240
which they never did.

30:53.240 --> 30:55.640
With the intention that they were going to do the best job they had,

30:55.640 --> 30:59.160
and they had this enlightened being's energy, so they should be able to persevere.

30:59.160 --> 31:03.160
So what normally would take four or eight hours at their work, they would work

31:03.160 --> 31:08.440
12, 14, 16 hours looking at books, copying code, doing all of this stuff that they could

31:08.440 --> 31:11.480
until they actually started understanding it usually.

31:11.480 --> 31:14.840
The girl that I worked with at City Corp, who was doing this, was on the phone all the time

31:14.840 --> 31:18.600
with her, with the other people in the cult, and she would use me as a source of information.

31:18.600 --> 31:22.680
She would ask me questions that were totally unrelated to her specific job.

31:22.680 --> 31:25.480
They were obviously, she was trying to help these other people.

31:25.480 --> 31:27.960
So basically, it would be the blind leading the blind.

31:27.960 --> 31:32.920
Sometimes they'd get caught, put on a literal blacklist because they were destroying code.

31:33.160 --> 31:38.120
As one newsletter that circulated among the industry's hiring managers stated,

31:38.120 --> 31:43.160
lenses followers were, quote, inserting themselves virus-like on accounts in the

31:43.160 --> 31:46.440
tri-state area where they proceeded to wreak havoc.

31:47.000 --> 31:51.080
But not all who lied their way into these companies were exposed.

31:51.080 --> 31:55.720
Many learned the software languages quickly enough to begin rising the ranks into high

31:55.720 --> 32:01.720
income positions, and they were advised to use this money to reinvest in their enlightenment.

32:01.720 --> 32:04.920
You get more money, which tells you how more enlightened you are.

32:04.920 --> 32:11.240
And since we're simple monks, we give this money back to him as a gesture of thank you.

32:13.240 --> 32:17.160
And then he takes the money as the gesture, and then he gives us more spiritual energy,

32:17.160 --> 32:21.960
which lets us meditate better, to program code better, and then give him more money.

32:21.960 --> 32:24.760
To study enlightenment requires a commitment.

32:24.760 --> 32:28.040
And part of that commitment is a person's willingness to go out and work to make the

32:28.040 --> 32:29.880
money to pay for their own way.

32:29.880 --> 32:34.760
How much money do you think you spent involved with Zen Master Rama?

32:34.760 --> 32:39.720
In cash layouts, for the five-month involvement from January to May 1985,

32:39.720 --> 32:42.920
I gave out a little over $30,000 in cash.

32:42.920 --> 32:46.520
And an exceptional person, of course, will pay even more, will give even more,

32:46.520 --> 32:49.160
because they not only want to just pay for their own way,

32:49.160 --> 32:53.000
but they wish to make enlightenment more available to others.

32:53.000 --> 32:56.760
Because you were a spiritual student of his, and you'd come to him and go,

32:56.760 --> 33:00.760
I have this great idea for a computer program or, you know, a database program.

33:01.480 --> 33:06.680
He would become CEO of every single one, like dozens of these companies.

33:09.000 --> 33:14.680
Lenz credited himself with developing software through the 1980s and 90s that he claimed was

33:14.680 --> 33:19.160
used by hundreds of American companies, both commercial and military.

33:19.800 --> 33:23.880
And it's reported that some of his more successful programmers were providing

33:23.880 --> 33:27.400
Lenz with upwards of $5,000 per month each.

33:27.400 --> 33:31.880
If I were to keep on going and had a full-time job out of college,

33:31.880 --> 33:38.040
I would have been paying as much as I could, $1,000 a month, which was a lot, $2,000 a month,

33:38.040 --> 33:45.640
and living with a number of other Lenz followers by sleeping on floors or packing into rooms.

33:45.640 --> 33:50.600
So we didn't have much overhead in eating ramen or just vegetables or whatever,

33:51.320 --> 33:54.280
and then giving him essentially all of our money.

33:54.280 --> 33:59.800
Did he ever, in any of his seminars, you know, verbally justify how he could ask that much?

34:00.760 --> 34:05.320
Lenz would say that at his level, and the amount of energy he had,

34:05.320 --> 34:11.240
there are so many people who want him dead, maybe from the government or these unknown

34:11.240 --> 34:14.280
evil people, or they just wanted to steal his energy.

34:14.280 --> 34:20.680
He needs to hide himself out and in planes fight protecting himself in impeccable locations

34:20.680 --> 34:26.040
that sat on like vortexes or energy centers that the earth naturally gives,

34:26.040 --> 34:31.000
and also surround himself with other high-class things that energetically

34:31.000 --> 34:36.040
contain his energy and protect him from this dangerous world.

34:36.600 --> 34:41.800
By 1988, Lenz was purchasing million-dollar homes across the United States

34:41.800 --> 34:44.600
in order to bring enlightenment to a wider audience.

34:45.160 --> 34:49.960
I can work anywhere I want in the world. I can do what I want to,

34:49.960 --> 34:56.040
when I want to, buy or not buy what I want to, and I have a good understanding of art,

34:56.040 --> 35:01.320
literature, mathematics, geography, computer science, and the world.

35:01.960 --> 35:07.320
I know a lot about people. I'm not a bigot, and I try and help people out whenever I can,

35:07.320 --> 35:10.440
but I'm also street smart. I know the street real well.

35:12.760 --> 35:18.680
By the end of the 1980s, Lenz had begun to elicit a fair amount of attention from journalists.

35:18.680 --> 35:22.120
LA Weekly published a several thousand-word expose,

35:22.120 --> 35:28.600
making it the centerpiece of the January 28th, 1988 issue with this illustration as the cover.

35:29.560 --> 35:34.040
There's a newspaper in Los Angeles called the LA Weekly that ran a story called Busting Rama.

35:34.040 --> 35:37.960
I didn't know that there was anything to but. I mean, I don't understand what the problem is.

35:37.960 --> 35:41.240
I teach seminars. They're very mainstream. I do them at Lincoln Center and every

35:41.320 --> 35:45.640
talk about me. The authors interviewed several ex-followers for the expose,

35:45.640 --> 35:50.760
marking one of the first times Lenz was publicly confronted with the more extraordinary claims

35:50.760 --> 35:55.160
he had convinced his students to believe. I want to see if some, any things are correct.

35:55.160 --> 35:59.800
Followers say that you make rooms glow with golden light. You can make the moon change colors,

35:59.800 --> 36:05.000
the star spin, the wind stop. We should all be so lucky. Sounds like they're talking about Jesus

36:05.000 --> 36:09.400
Christ here today. It does to me. Are you denied having ever climbed any of this? Of course not.

36:09.400 --> 36:13.000
If you meet an enlightened person, you will see, if you have the ability to see on a subtle

36:13.000 --> 36:17.160
physical level, a beautiful golden light around them. Oh, you may see many other things.

36:17.160 --> 36:21.960
You claim to be one of the 12 fully enlightened beings on this planet? No, of course not.

36:21.960 --> 36:27.560
In my estimation, at this time, there are 12 fully enlightened teachers in this world of which I am one.

36:28.200 --> 36:32.920
Lenz claimed to be one of the 12 enlightened beings on earth. Do you know what he meant by that?

36:32.920 --> 36:39.480
Yeah, people who have evolved for like, come, uh, incarnated for thousands of incarnations

36:39.480 --> 36:42.600
who have studied Buddhism at a certain point, you get to a point like a,

36:42.600 --> 36:48.520
like a Buddhist or a Jesus state, right? Where you're so enlightened and connected to the universe

36:49.320 --> 36:55.800
that you're at the top. Are you one of the 12 enlightened beings on earth? I am an enlightened

36:55.800 --> 37:00.840
teacher and it would take about an hour to explain what that means. Who are the other 11?

37:01.560 --> 37:06.440
Well, there's a very well-known gentleman in India called Satya Sai Baba and so on and so

37:06.440 --> 37:11.880
forth, names you wouldn't even know. It was almost a threat if you think about it. If it's not him,

37:11.880 --> 37:16.760
there's a good chance you're not going to find the other ones. You really lucked out or you were

37:16.760 --> 37:23.560
meant to find him. Other claims include Lenz telling his followers that he could stop breathing while

37:23.560 --> 37:27.400
in deep meditation. When you go into Samadhi, very often you won't breathe for half an hour,

37:27.400 --> 37:33.320
an hour. There's no breath at all. And something called blisses, this line of puppets that Lenz

37:33.320 --> 37:40.920
had imbued with spiritual energy. What does this have to do with Zen master Rama? Anyone want to

37:40.920 --> 37:46.120
just jump in here? It's fun. I can guess it's called a bliss and you've got them in your

37:46.120 --> 37:51.720
apartment and part of the things they do is get rid of demons. Question. Hold on, hold on.

37:51.720 --> 37:57.160
But the most alarming revelation in the busting Rama expose was what Lenz did to many of the

37:57.160 --> 38:02.280
women in the group. We're not really having sex at all. It's an exchange of energy.

38:03.240 --> 38:08.520
As a young man in Lenz's circle, did he treat you any differently from the women in the group?

38:08.520 --> 38:15.240
I wasn't aware of it at the time, but the answer is yes. So what was happening behind the scenes

38:15.800 --> 38:24.920
was that he would pick out some woman or young woman and convince them that if they had sex with

38:24.920 --> 38:31.960
him, it's actually like a tantric way of him viewing them with spiritual energy. The greatest

38:31.960 --> 38:37.800
transfer, karmic transfer, occurs in aside from meditating with someone, in sex with someone.

38:37.800 --> 38:43.480
He said that he had sex with many of his women students. It was strictly a spiritual exercise

38:43.480 --> 38:51.960
designed to energize me and raise my awareness level up to a higher realm. I actually heard that

38:51.960 --> 38:58.200
some of his inner circle were convincing new people to do the same thing because they were higher

38:58.200 --> 39:06.120
than everybody else. I talked to one guy after the fact after we were both out and his girlfriend was

39:06.120 --> 39:10.680
one of those people and they broke up because of it and he left the group not because he didn't

39:10.680 --> 39:17.080
believe that he was unenlightened and he was a fraud. He actually left because this feels

39:17.080 --> 39:23.800
unequal because there's no option for him to have sex or some equivalent with this guy.

39:23.800 --> 39:29.560
Throughout the 1980s, much of Lenz's advertising campaign appeared to be aimed exclusively toward

39:29.560 --> 39:35.800
women. He has somewhat of a radical, very pro-women liberation point of view. It's days for him to

39:35.800 --> 39:41.640
tell us as women how we can attain greater enlightenment. Good morning, welcome to our show.

39:42.600 --> 39:47.000
From a point of view of meditation, let's say that women have an inner power that men don't. We

39:47.000 --> 39:52.440
know that women's bodies are stronger than men. They can endure greater temperature changes,

39:52.440 --> 39:57.400
heat, cold. There are physiological differences, but from a psychic point of view, women just have

39:57.400 --> 40:04.200
a stronger energy. They can bear more and endure more. By the end of the decade, Lenz had accumulated

40:04.200 --> 40:10.440
over a thousand followers with a high tuition inner circle of nearly 400 dedicated members.

40:10.440 --> 40:16.920
The group had spread over the country with meditation bases in Palo Alto, Malibu, New York,

40:16.920 --> 40:23.480
and Boston. You originally started in New York. You moved to San Diego. You had you

40:23.480 --> 40:27.800
asked people to follow you from New York to San Diego. You asked some of those people to follow

40:27.800 --> 40:32.520
you from San Diego to Malibu. Now, I had a meditation center in San Diego, Los Angeles,

40:32.520 --> 40:38.040
and San Francisco. That's true. I've never asked anyone to move anywhere. Did Lenz ever ask his

40:38.040 --> 40:44.600
followers to move or relocate with him? Yes. There would be rumblings for a few weeks or a

40:44.600 --> 40:50.200
month or two like the Exodus is coming up. My first Exodus was when we went from Boston to

40:50.200 --> 40:56.360
Los Angeles or to Chicago. I can't remember the places. You would leave all your friends and

40:56.360 --> 41:02.440
family and everyone you ever knew like they were old clothes that don't fit anymore. When you show

41:02.440 --> 41:07.160
up to this new place, you're finally free of the past. You get to reinvent yourself.

41:08.440 --> 41:14.120
Instead of talking to your family members, you can give them their beeper number. So,

41:14.120 --> 41:20.920
you're like connected, but you never respond to the beeper number. I was preparing for mine

41:20.920 --> 41:26.600
and saving money by living in my parents' house while I was working full-time to disappear to New

41:26.600 --> 41:33.720
York and just disappear, not even say goodbye. Gone. There are certain places. We call them places

41:33.720 --> 41:39.880
of power on the earth. These are fabulous places. These are places where there's more energy available.

41:39.880 --> 41:46.360
For some reason, when you meditate in these places, it's easier to stop your thoughts. There was a

41:46.360 --> 41:51.800
time limit hidden from the concerned family and friends who might be considering an intervention.

41:51.800 --> 41:57.480
If they didn't act quickly, they might lose the opportunity for good. But without an understanding

41:57.480 --> 42:02.440
of what these students were experiencing, many interventions went nowhere. He asked,

42:02.440 --> 42:09.480
so, Mark, are you getting involved in a cult? And I said, no, Rabbi, I'm studying spiritual

42:09.480 --> 42:18.440
mysticism. And he sort of looked at me and he said, well, Judaism is a set of laws and we don't

42:18.440 --> 42:25.880
deal with that stuff. What the students of Frederick Lenz really needed was expert intervention.

42:25.880 --> 42:30.040
Would you mind introducing yourself and giving it a description of what it is that you do?

42:30.040 --> 42:37.560
Yeah, hello. My name is Joe Simhart. I'm known as a cult information specialist. Since 1980,

42:37.560 --> 42:43.880
I've helped people, families, the media understand the cult problem. I've done interventions that

42:43.880 --> 42:50.680
were called the programings or exit counselings, approximately 500 or more. I also have a career

42:50.680 --> 42:56.600
in the fight arts. Joe Simhart was a recurring voice of opposition throughout Frederick Lenz's

42:56.600 --> 43:02.280
career. In the late 80s, he publicly confronted Lenz on the talk show A Current Affair.

43:02.280 --> 43:07.880
What does he do that creates such loyalty? Well, for one thing, he sets himself up as

43:07.880 --> 43:13.400
something that he is not. A Zen master, an enlightened being, a person who can traverse

43:13.400 --> 43:19.960
in the occult world at will. I do two night a month seminars that a person attends and may or

43:19.960 --> 43:24.920
may not attend again. I don't see how this race is occult. Joe's interest in this field came

43:24.920 --> 43:30.520
organically. Throughout the 1970s, he'd been a member of the Apocalyptic Church Universal and

43:30.520 --> 43:37.240
Triumphant, led by the charismatic Guru Ma, who claimed to be, quote, God incarnate.

43:37.240 --> 43:43.000
In unraveling that whole thing and deconstructing what I had been involved in, I became kind of an

43:43.000 --> 43:49.400
expert in the field of fundamentalist Christianity, New Age cult, Strait Buddhism, self-help groups,

43:49.400 --> 43:54.760
all kinds of things that are related to this sort of activity. The programmers and exit counselors

43:54.760 --> 44:00.760
got to know about me and asked me to go on cases with them. So I got, I guess, good at it at doing

44:00.760 --> 44:05.240
conflict resolution with families that were impacted by this. And quite a few people would

44:05.240 --> 44:09.480
leave these cults after talking to me, sometimes for several hours, sometimes for a week.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.800
When did Frederick Lenz first appear on your radar?

44:14.360 --> 44:20.760
In 1986, a family called me from California complaining that their daughter had just got

44:20.760 --> 44:26.280
home and she was a mess and had been living with Frederick Lenz Rama for three months at his place

44:26.280 --> 44:33.400
in Long Island. They flew me out and I spent a week with their daughter and she filled me in on

44:33.400 --> 44:38.920
Lenz's behavior. He had her take LSD and she said during the first trip she ever did on LSD,

44:38.920 --> 44:44.680
he began to scream and yell at her for failing him, for not being respecting him as an enlightened

44:44.680 --> 44:50.680
person and she was devastated and suicidal, he left her alone in the house. Sadie's used as a

44:50.680 --> 44:55.640
woman, you know her? Sure do. She says she was seduced by you, you made her a mistress, she says

44:55.640 --> 44:59.640
you encouraged her to use LSD, try to make her believe she was possessed by demons, told her she

44:59.880 --> 45:04.920
was the only one who could save her from the dark. She called a friend that came to pick her up and

45:04.920 --> 45:11.560
called her family and they got her on a plane and sent her home and so I helped her to deconstruct

45:11.560 --> 45:17.720
or debrief her about what happened to her, you know, what cults are about, what narcissistic

45:17.720 --> 45:22.520
leaders are about, the fact that Lenz didn't appear to be enlightened and his claim to be in

45:22.520 --> 45:27.880
light was just a claim to be entitled. Well she ran away, that's true, that's bad, this is someone

45:27.880 --> 45:32.440
I spent some time with, a young woman, a very beautiful young woman who I went out with and

45:32.440 --> 45:36.840
we traveled together for a while and had a great time together, she seemed to have an obsession

45:36.840 --> 45:42.920
as some people do with demons, it was unfortunate, I liked her very very much, I thought she was just

45:42.920 --> 45:48.440
super. That started my career with him, one of his mistresses and subsequently I had Exit Council

45:48.440 --> 45:54.600
of about five other mistresses of his and about 20 other members. What were the greatest challenges

45:54.600 --> 45:59.560
in deprogramming a devoted follower of Lenz? Yeah so the difficulty is just getting the whole

45:59.560 --> 46:04.440
conversation started and once a person realizes that it's all about their choice, you know,

46:04.440 --> 46:10.200
they can stay in the group forever if they wish to for every reincarnation or they could even

46:10.200 --> 46:15.160
talk it out and see what I had to say or what the ex-member I had with me had to say, you know,

46:15.160 --> 46:19.880
over time in most of those cases on the third day the person was ready to defect from the group.

46:19.880 --> 46:24.280
Joe was often joined in these interventions by former students of Lenz,

46:24.280 --> 46:29.720
many of whom Joe had Exit Counciled himself and when they weren't assisting in deprogrammings,

46:29.720 --> 46:35.160
these ex-followers could be found protesting outside of Lenz's seminars. Could you describe

46:35.160 --> 46:39.640
some of the common characteristics of a Rama student? Most of them were quite attractive,

46:39.640 --> 46:44.600
young, intelligent, they could have been successful in business, you know, higher than

46:44.600 --> 46:49.720
average IQ, lower than average IQ about comparative religions and another understanding

46:49.720 --> 46:55.800
what Buddhism was really about so he could fool them as far as that aspect of spirituality and

46:56.600 --> 47:03.320
you know, hungry for either spiritual enlightenment or success. The unenlightened can only take you

47:03.320 --> 47:08.120
to the beach because they can't bring you across the ocean. God can do that directly if that's the

47:08.120 --> 47:13.640
will of eternity or God will do that through the voice and the guidance of what we call an enlightened

47:13.640 --> 47:19.240
person. It's this exchange between the narcissist and the hero-hungry person. The narcissist becomes

47:19.240 --> 47:25.560
a foil like a movie that they can watch and feel part of and they join that guru on this stage.

47:26.680 --> 47:31.160
You get kind of caught up in it, it becomes a self-ceiling social system and anything that's

47:31.160 --> 47:36.120
critical of that self-ceiling social system is considered ignorant or evil or some other

47:36.120 --> 47:40.040
thought-terminating cliche that prevents the person from thinking about the criticism.

47:40.040 --> 47:45.640
During television appearances, Joe was often captioned as being affiliated with an organization

47:45.640 --> 47:50.200
called the Colt Awareness Network. You know, this guy's not the head of the Colt Awareness Network.

47:50.200 --> 47:55.800
Our eyes is a programmer who's hired to do kidnappings for $50,000 a hit. Can, as it would be

47:55.800 --> 48:03.080
called, formed following the Jonestown massacre of 1978 when spiritual leader Jim Jones coerced over

48:03.080 --> 48:08.680
900 followers to ingest cyanide in what he called a revolutionary suicide.

48:09.240 --> 48:13.800
We cannot afford to forget what happened in Jonestown, said Cann's initial director.

48:14.360 --> 48:20.120
They had annual conferences. The basic function was to disseminate information about controversial

48:20.120 --> 48:25.000
groups. There was a time if you were worried about your son or daughter being an occult,

48:25.000 --> 48:30.360
you could get help from a small non-profit organization called the Colt Awareness Network,

48:31.320 --> 48:35.720
one follower of Lenz described the Colt Awareness Network as, quote,

48:35.720 --> 48:42.680
utterly vicious people who prey on others religious freedom. Lenz himself told Newsday that, quote,

48:42.680 --> 48:46.760
Cann is to small religious groups what the KKK is to black people.

48:46.760 --> 48:51.720
If anything is a cult, it's the Colt Awareness Network, and I will tell you that. That is a cult.

48:51.720 --> 48:57.800
I think Lenz is an individual who craves power. I think Lenz is an individual who has found how

48:57.800 --> 49:03.880
to manipulate people to satisfy his craving for power. There's an organization that calls itself

49:03.880 --> 49:10.040
the Colt Awareness Network, and they put families in touch with kidnappers who go out and grab these

49:10.040 --> 49:17.640
people, sometimes 25 to 50 grand a shot is paid by wealthy parents. There were only two cases that

49:17.640 --> 49:25.160
I can recall regarding Lenz, two young ladies that began coercively where the family had kidnapped

49:25.160 --> 49:31.960
them and flew me in after securing them to try to talk them to leave Lenz. And both of those

49:31.960 --> 49:38.520
cases didn't work, unfortunately, but all the voluntary cases I did with his followers did work.

49:38.520 --> 49:45.880
One of those women was Jennifer Jacobs. Yes. I had me locked in this hotel for 11 days until

49:45.880 --> 49:51.640
I ring out my police system. Okay, I am 22 years old. I'm a legal adult. They have no right. They

49:51.640 --> 49:59.800
can be concerned all the while, but they have no man right to kidnap me. In the September 18, 1992

49:59.800 --> 50:05.800
issue of the Philadelphia Enquirer, a woman named Jennifer Jacobs published a letter to the editor

50:05.800 --> 50:10.680
in response to an exposé the Enquirer had published the previous week called,

50:10.680 --> 50:17.320
As Guru's Disciples Hit Town Critics Cry Beware, the author of the exposé interviewed Jennifer's

50:17.320 --> 50:22.040
parents and they were quoted saying that since joining Lenz's meditation group,

50:22.040 --> 50:27.480
their daughter had stopped speaking to them and quote, no longer has a sense of humor and has

50:27.480 --> 50:33.640
stopped playing the piano, a passion she had since childhood. Jennifer had written to tell her side

50:33.640 --> 50:41.720
of the story, quote, in 1987, my parents paid $25,000 to have me brutally kidnapped, locked in

50:41.720 --> 50:48.440
captivity, terrorized and abused for 11 days in a filthy motel in what was euphemistically called

50:48.440 --> 50:55.480
an involuntary deprogramming, end quote. She used similar language in our affidavit, naming her

50:55.480 --> 51:02.520
parents as complicit in the kidnapping and Joe as among the two deprogrammers. I read the affidavit

51:03.800 --> 51:09.320
she accused can of kidnapping her and holding her against her will in a hotel room for 11 days

51:09.320 --> 51:15.480
in an effort to deprogram her. Is there truth to that? Well, can of the call to awareness network

51:15.480 --> 51:19.720
had nothing to do with it. Number one, they didn't hire the programmers and they didn't

51:19.720 --> 51:25.400
manage them even though people that did interventions attended can conferences and would do some

51:25.400 --> 51:32.360
networking but can didn't approve of kidnapping programming. So that was wrong. I'm trying to

51:32.360 --> 51:36.680
think of a, I don't remember if it went 11 days, I think it probably went like a week.

51:37.640 --> 51:43.960
She went to a rehab center afterwards, you know, agreeing to go and which was for ex-called members

51:43.960 --> 51:49.800
and she escaped from there or left it because you could, it was voluntary and she went back

51:49.800 --> 51:54.280
to the group and after that we heard all this negative stuff about the experience.

51:54.920 --> 52:00.920
That is a potent self-righteous man and that is the attitude of the whole call to awareness network.

52:00.920 --> 52:05.960
She was quite angry, her family ended me. I've since met with her after she broke away from

52:05.960 --> 52:12.920
lens and we've reconciled all of that. In 1992, Joe was quoted saying, I don't recommend coercive

52:12.920 --> 52:16.920
situations anymore because there's too much trauma involved for everyone.

52:27.960 --> 52:32.440
Hello power lovers. I'm here today on top of the continental divide.

52:33.240 --> 52:40.280
11,500 feet up above the earth. I'm parked by the side of the road. It's around 745

52:41.080 --> 52:46.200
in the evening on August 7th. Occasionally a car or truck will roar by.

52:49.240 --> 52:57.960
I'm facing some distant power mountains, a suitable place to discuss with you the end of the world.

52:58.920 --> 53:05.000
By the 1990s, Frederick Lenz's career had entered a precarious phase. On the surface,

53:05.000 --> 53:09.640
things seemed to be trending in his favor. He published his first novel titled,

53:09.640 --> 53:14.840
Surfing the Himalayas, the story of a young spiritual aspirant and a zen master named

53:14.840 --> 53:19.960
Flop who set out to snowboard their way to enlightenment. Now, your book is about a lot

53:19.960 --> 53:24.520
more than snowboarding. I mean, in this case, the perfect ride is really about spiritual

53:24.600 --> 53:29.400
enlightenment, isn't it? Well, snowboarding is spiritual enlightenment. Snowboarding is the

53:29.400 --> 53:33.640
fastest growing sport in the world and in five years there are going to be more people on snowboards

53:33.640 --> 53:38.920
than on skis. But yes, you're absolutely right. Snowboarding is about balance. The novel sold

53:38.920 --> 53:45.320
90,000 copies. It was even publicly endorsed by Chicago Bull's head coach, Phil Jackson,

53:45.320 --> 53:49.880
who quickly whiffed through the blurb after backlash from the Chicago Tribune.

53:49.880 --> 53:56.520
The sequel, Snowboarding to Nirvana, also sold well. Enrolling stone after reading the latest

53:56.520 --> 54:01.960
coverage of Pearl Jam's battle with Ticketmaster and flipping past all the ads for CD subscription

54:01.960 --> 54:07.880
services, readers would find Lenz's face with two full-printed pages dedicated to

54:07.880 --> 54:13.080
promoting the new Zazen album. There's also what must have seemed a reassuring amount of

54:13.080 --> 54:18.840
web-hosted fan pages that appeared around this time, but Lenz's reputation at large

54:18.840 --> 54:26.040
only continued to plummet. In 1993, ex-follower Mark Laxer released a memoir called Take Me for

54:26.040 --> 54:31.720
a Ride. The book details how Lenz convinced his students that Sri Chenmoy couldn't actually

54:31.720 --> 54:37.240
achieve Samadhi, the deepest state of meditation in which union with the Supreme is reached,

54:37.240 --> 54:42.120
and had only been faking it for clout. And how Mark and other male students were

54:42.120 --> 54:47.640
dissuaded from even speaking to the women in the group for fear of bringing down their energy

54:47.640 --> 54:53.720
while Lenz himself was privately pursuing them. Laxer's impetus for leaving the group was the

54:53.720 --> 55:00.120
passing of a student named Donald Cole, who'd named Lenz in the note he left behind. Cole had

55:00.120 --> 55:06.920
been among the 400th students purged by Lenz for, quote, maintaining an abysmal level of consciousness.

55:06.920 --> 55:11.800
There were times where he, irrationally, I mean, these were people, three or five hundred people,

55:11.800 --> 55:16.280
who'd be giving him tens of thousands of dollars, like constantly, and he would just get rid of half

55:16.280 --> 55:20.600
of everyone. He would just, like, wipe everybody out. Sometimes a spiritual teacher will literally

55:20.600 --> 55:25.080
kick out some of their best students because it's time for them to go out and experience for a while

55:25.080 --> 55:29.720
in the world. Sometimes a student just isn't doing well. They're knocking their head against the wall.

55:29.720 --> 55:33.000
Well, if you're a good teacher, you don't let them keep knocking their head against the wall.

55:33.000 --> 55:37.880
They hurt themselves. You send them out for a while. People would be sobbing. Lenz was

55:37.880 --> 55:42.920
simultaneously threatening to use his spiritual energy against students who left the group of

55:42.920 --> 55:50.360
their own accord. It is possible that he could give me cancer or, as I'm driving late at night,

55:50.920 --> 55:57.400
alone. My card is my flip. Do you know how Lenz would dissuade his followers from leaving his group?

55:57.400 --> 56:02.440
Well, there was a lot of dark forces out there, according to him, and that without his protection,

56:02.440 --> 56:07.640
you will fall into insanity. Your life will collapse. You won't have a chance for enlightenment for

56:07.640 --> 56:13.800
many lifetimes. Now that you're sort of connected with his energy spiritually, if you were to leave

56:13.800 --> 56:20.120
your body is so kind of addicted or connected that you would quickly fall into the lower levels,

56:20.120 --> 56:26.120
kind of the hell levels of existence, in which case you'd go crazy. You'd get cancer. You'd get

56:26.120 --> 56:31.640
into a car accident. About three years out of the group, I still believe he could do that. He could

56:31.720 --> 56:38.440
stop my heart. He could cause a car accident. But the 1990s saw Lenz's opposition ramping up as well.

56:38.440 --> 56:43.320
X students managed to get his novels dropped from Barnes & Noble promotional events,

56:43.320 --> 56:48.520
and reports surfaced of a group of parents called LenzWatch, who worked synergistically with the

56:48.520 --> 56:53.800
Cult Awareness Network in order to find students and connect them with exit counselors. For more

56:53.800 --> 56:58.600
information about Lenz and his followers, you can contact the Cult Awareness Network or a group

56:58.600 --> 57:04.360
called LenzWatch. I had told my mother, whatever you do, if the Cult Awareness Network gives you

57:04.360 --> 57:08.760
a call and tries to convince you that I'm in a cult, just hang up on them. They're going to try

57:08.760 --> 57:13.400
to deprogram me and try to get tons of money out of you. And then I walked away and she said,

57:13.400 --> 57:19.320
the Cult Awareness Network, that sounds legit. So she called them and it turns out one of the top

57:19.320 --> 57:26.120
cult interventionists or exit counselors lived just three towns away or five times away. And

57:26.120 --> 57:29.720
I still thought that they were going to be full of shit, but I was like, I might as well listen

57:29.720 --> 57:34.600
to what they have to say. My friends are there, my family is there, this guy who's the cult expert,

57:34.600 --> 57:41.560
and a few ex-members are all there. And they show me videotapes of Scientology, the boonies,

57:41.560 --> 57:47.800
and stuff like that. And I want to say three or four hours into just talking and learning about

57:47.800 --> 57:55.720
mind control and other cults. I had the sensation of popping out of it. It was like, pop. And I

57:55.720 --> 58:01.640
looked around and I was like, oh my God, you have no idea the shit I believed. Oh my God,

58:01.640 --> 58:06.760
it was like waking up from a year, year and a half long dream and having the memories of a

58:06.760 --> 58:14.360
totally different person. I actually had my stepfather drive down to where my ex-fiancé,

58:14.360 --> 58:18.360
and she was still in it, drove down after the first day, picked her up, brought her down,

58:18.360 --> 58:24.120
and I shared the intervention with her. And so she would pop out of it. She was not as dedicated

58:24.280 --> 58:28.280
as I was, but there was still the mind control going on with her.

58:29.400 --> 58:36.680
In 1996, Dateline NBC delivered a critical blow to Lenzi's career, a primetime expose,

58:36.680 --> 58:41.640
this time featuring an ex-member of Zazen, who was quick to call Lenzi out for sharing

58:41.640 --> 58:47.800
songwriting credits with the band. I never, in my definition of composition and writing,

58:47.800 --> 58:51.400
saw him write anything. What does he play? He doesn't play anything.

58:52.040 --> 58:56.360
The film crew captured a Zazen jam session, showing what Lenz

58:56.360 --> 58:59.160
psychically cleansing the music looked like in action.

59:02.920 --> 59:04.920
Now let's go in the opposite way down.

59:11.320 --> 59:12.200
Can I get funky?

59:12.680 --> 59:21.960
He was apparently using a lot more drugs. I mean, he used LSD,

59:21.960 --> 59:27.000
uppers and downers, and from one inside person told me he had also been using cocaine.

59:27.000 --> 59:31.160
And he looked, you know, the last time he was on television was on Dateline program.

59:31.160 --> 59:36.120
It was very thin. I got this Caucasian body and it's created all kinds of problems in the

59:36.120 --> 59:40.280
West. I've never had one before. It's a new experience. I mean, it's to being shorter

59:41.000 --> 59:47.000
and being in a land where I am understood. He wasn't as effective as an influencer

59:47.560 --> 59:51.240
the last couple of years, and I think a lot of followers began to break away from him.

59:52.040 --> 59:55.720
The segment also featured a newly defected Jim Piccarello,

59:55.720 --> 59:59.880
who at times seemed stunned by his own story as he recounted it.

59:59.880 --> 01:00:05.320
I thought that this guy can turn the room into gold. I was pretty much into it at the

01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:09.960
beginning of the dinner. By the end of the dinner, I was willing to hang out with that group for

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:15.080
pretty much the rest of my life. Over time, not only did I see him turn the room gold,

01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:21.000
which I saw it every single time during a retreat, a desert retreat. I saw him at night

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:27.160
skate on beams of light, you know, over the sand. Oh, I saw him disappear. I've seen him turn into a

01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:33.240
woman into a Princeton's weird bug-like creature. I've seen them levitate. In the very beginning,

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:38.280
what did they do? They had us get into a trance state by meditating. And then they would talk about

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:45.080
what the experience is when you're with a enlightened being and you are spiritually sensitive.

01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:49.480
A, you want to be spiritually sensitive and want to be better than other people. You're a person.

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:54.040
B, you're interested in being with an enlightened master. Because how cool would that be? You're

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:58.360
a special person who's learning stuff that no one else is learning. You're in a room with

01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:03.240
300 people that believe this guy is enlightened. You've got the group dynamics that are shaping

01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:08.200
your experience. And then when he comes out and he lowers the lights and gets you into

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:12.680
a state and you have a belief like, I want to be special. I want to follow someone who's special.

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:21.240
Start experiencing what they describe historical enlightened beings are like. And I saw gold.

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:33.000
In the early spring of 1998, Long Island police pulled the body of Frederick Lenz from the bottom

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:39.160
of a bay located behind one of his New York homes. A local reporter described a small crowd of

01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:44.760
onlookers who'd gathered to watch the scene and the leading hypothesis that Lenz had been killed

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:50.040
by the parent of a student, someone who'd felt Lenz had, quote, brainwashed their kids.

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:55.800
Adding to this theory was a section of damaged railing along the pier where it was determined

01:01:55.800 --> 01:02:01.640
Lenz entered the water. But when the body was recovered, they found Lenz dressed in a Versace

01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:08.120
suit with a dog collar buckled around his neck. The Scotty dog had died years before in a volume.

01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:13.480
He had that dog collar on his neck. He claimed the buyer was his most enlightened student and

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:17.560
that they had been together many times in past lives. I mean, this is how delusional he was.

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:24.120
Inside Lenz's home were two other Scottish terriers and one student. The dogs were in

01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:30.680
critical condition, having eaten volume that was hidden inside their dog food. The student had also

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:36.520
taken lethal amounts of barbiturates and was found staring at a framed photo of Lenz with a note

01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:42.920
beside her that read, we all tried to go to the other world last night and only Rama made it.

01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:48.120
Please help us make it to the other world. The woman was discovered by the housekeeper

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:53.720
when she came in and she got help and survived this overdose and so did the dogs by the way.

01:02:54.680 --> 01:03:01.720
After a toxicology report found that Lenz had ingested 150 tablets of value mixed with Vodka

01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:05.400
prior to drowning, his death was deemed self-inflicted.

01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:19.560
Beyond this world, beyond other worlds, be they interdimensional worlds or physical worlds,

01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:26.040
there is something else which is that vast unknown that we call eternity. It is where we have come

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:33.240
from. It is that which is within us and it is where we eventually return. I can't tell you what that

01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:40.680
is like. I have meditated and experienced that. I have tasted it and felt it. Then I went beyond

01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:47.000
that to become it. The widespread reactions of followers to Lenz's death have mostly been lost

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:52.520
to time, but archived message boards show students sharing photos of group memorials

01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:57.400
and a sudden urgency to reconnect with other members they might not have seen in years.

01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:03.080
Oh, I actually found out about his death at my wedding. I was walking around with my friend Bob who

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:08.120
was involved in my intervention and we're walking around he goes oh what did you think about Lenz

01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:14.680
dying and I was like what? I was just surprised that he tried to kill other beings which is so

01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:20.760
un Buddhist. I was like okay well one less cult leader in the world. I was in my mid 20s. I didn't

01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:29.000
have a lot of empathy for incredibly abusive sociopaths. Hi, my name is Rama and today I would

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:34.120
like to teach you how to meditate. Lenz never groomed a successor to lead the meditation group

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:39.880
in his absence. On the contrary, he'd been adamant that none of his students had come close to

01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:44.600
achieving a level of consciousness that could be called enlightenment. So when my friends write me

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:48.840
and tell me they're enlightened, it's like someone who's just taken a second year French

01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:54.120
course announcing that they've just completed their PhD. So the group continued without a living

01:04:54.120 --> 01:05:00.440
figurehead. Today the few remaining and incoming students have virtual meetups to discuss Lenz's

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:06.200
teachings or to watch his favorite movies. Some meditate on framed portraits of him they keep

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:13.320
in their homes. Others simulate his golden light with augmented reality and clips from his VHS tapes

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:18.520
will occasionally appear while scrolling YouTube shorts. When you meditate over a period of time

01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:24.040
you'll come to see more and more of the many faces and sides of creation and in this one brief

01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:29.800
lifetime you can experience ecstasy thousands and thousands of times. Why do you think someone like

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:35.960
Rama even after all these years still has a loyal fan base? There are other groups that are

01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:40.680
selling his halt. One of the ones that's most successful these days is run by a guy they

01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:46.360
call himself Sampara who's a lens offshoot or a Rama offshoot. His real name is Jeff Malone,

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:51.720
G-E-O-F-F Malone and his group's called the Buddha Dojo and it was called Awaken Mind at one time.

01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:56.760
But it's very lens-like. When people approach that group they don't know that lens is behind it

01:05:56.760 --> 01:06:02.120
and they might never know but once you get deeply involved then you get its reveal that lens is the

01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:08.200
Guru. You know it's just like in his day the seekers out there that want to believe that there's

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:12.760
people out there that are enlightened and they think that if they come across one they'll recognize

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:17.480
this person you know they all use this line when the the seeker is ready the Buddha will appear.

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:22.840
That's that line that's slow but it's probably gotten more and people into bizarre cults at

01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:28.440
least Eastern groups than any other because people in their own narcissism think that they will have

01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:34.680
this insight or this psychic power to recognize a real guru when they see one. It was lens's will

01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:40.920
that is net worth which included several houses and cars totaling around 18 million dollars be

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:47.080
used to establish a charity in his name with the objective of quote disseminating Zen Buddhist

01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:53.080
teachings meditation and yoga in the context of what I have taught as American Buddhism.

01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:58.680
The Frederick P. Lenz Foundation for American Buddhism still exists today and claims to give

01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:05.640
millions to Buddhist friendly causes across the world. In 2013 a follower named Liz Lewinson

01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:12.040
crowdfunded 29,000 dollars in order to write a biography of Frederick Lenz titled Gaze in my

01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:19.640
direction. It was New Year's Eve 1998 and he said to me you will be my biographer three months

01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:26.280
later he was gone he staged his exit. Lewinson's account of Lenz covers much of the same time period

01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:32.280
as Mark Laxer's memoir but the tone couldn't be more different. She describes the change of stage

01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:38.360
names as Lenz incarnating into the Hindu god Rama. I don't like calling him Rama it's an insult to

01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:43.640
those who actually follow either Hinduism or Buddhism and Lenz's reasons for breaking away

01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:49.480
from Chinmoy having largely to do with Chinmoy's strict rule of celibacy. I went through terrible

01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:55.560
times I went through times of self-hate thinking how undeveloped spiritually I was everyone else in

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:59.720
the ashram a thousand people nobody had a girlfriend or a boyfriend I did.

01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:14.200
Sri Chinmoy never had the reputational downfall that Lenz experienced. Around the time of Lenz's

01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:19.480
death the Chinmoy centers around the world were celebrating the completion of seven million bird

01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:25.640
drawings. Chinmoy's students continued performing endurance challenges throughout the decades.

01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:31.800
By the 1990s powerlifting had become Chinmoy's preferred method of demonstrating the supreme.

01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:37.320
Whether he was calf raising a helicopter or an elephant or wrist curling a giant dumbbell

01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:41.880
he always kept the cumulative weight prominently displayed for the audience to consider.

01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:45.080
Go Guru come on up yes.

01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:52.600
Occasionally he would combine his creative miracles for a show stopping finale.

01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:56.440
Over close to 1500 books it gives you just a brief idea of how prolific

01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:59.560
Guru is. He has written close to 1500 different books.

01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:11.480
Chinmoy's sheer quantity of creative output has always been seen as dubious by those outside of

01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:18.200
his meditation centers. And some of his more outlandish feats such as this lift listed at over

01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:25.080
7,000 pounds were difficult for even his most loyal adherents to believe. But Chinmoy had a

01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:31.640
seasoned defense. I don't blame people who suspect my performance he said my own mind suspects it.

01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:39.480
When Chinmoy passed away in 2007 at the age of 76 the way he was eulogized in the media

01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:47.080
couldn't have been more different from that of Frederick Lenz. Then in 2015 13x followers converged

01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:53.160
to form a youtube channel called the Sree Chinmoy Disciple Experience. And you know it's very scary

01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:57.400
and very daunting especially when you hear all the horror stories that Guru used to tell Sree

01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:00.520
Chinmoy say oh if you leave the center you know you're gonna want them you're gonna get raped

01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:04.840
you're gonna get cancer you're gonna the hostile force they're gonna capture. You know that was

01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:10.600
like my only family because I had to cut off my real family for 21 years. I just had pretty much

01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:16.120
resigned myself that that was it for this life you know just many times Guru said it's just one

01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:21.400
incarnation and I thought to myself okay fine I can just give one incarnation for this. Being in

01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:26.520
the meditation center was very much about trying not to be human. Certain parts of the being like

01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:31.320
between here and here and everything else was meant to be dead. Targeted out by having me sit in

01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:36.280
front of him and meditate and then he was like saying are you surrendered and I have my hands full

01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:42.120
and I said supreme I bow to thee and then he was like oh are you really surrendered and then he

01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:56.600
said take your clothes off. Unconditional surrender to the will of the supreme. The last development

01:10:56.680 --> 01:11:03.240
of the story of Frederick Lenz came in 2021 when the remains of Brenda Kerber a programmer and

01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:10.440
meditation student who disappeared in 1988 were recovered. Her car had been driven into a reservoir

01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:16.200
and act that police ruled intentional. She'd given up custody of her kids before her disappearance

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:21.480
and her diary entries indicate it was so she could move across the country to follow Lenz

01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:23.960
who she referred to as golden boy.

01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:35.320
So the cult awareness network seems to have dissolved in the late 1990s. Can you talk about

01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:41.960
what happened? So uh Scientology was one of the groups that really went after any group that

01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:47.320
criticized them and and especially hated the cult awareness network. They sued the can group 50

01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:54.280
times. I got hit with 12 suits in one week. I would open the door a process server would give

01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:59.800
me a suit. They were suing us all over the country sometimes simultaneously. There was a case in

01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:06.600
the early 1990s where the programmer named Rick Ross took on a case in west it was a fundamentalist

01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:12.520
Christian group where he takes a counsel teenage sons of a woman out of a group and then she wanted

01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:18.840
her then 18 year old son exit counseled also and it didn't work. He had been kidnapped. He went

01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:23.640
back to the group. Scientology got a hold of the young man and got him to run a lawsuit against

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:30.600
the cult awareness network based on the fact that Rick Ross had some vague connection to uh can even

01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:36.280
though he didn't attend the meetings. Scientology's lawyers were quite adept at this kind of case

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:41.480
where can didn't have good representation because it was poorly funded and they couldn't afford

01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:48.760
a good legal team. Scientology won the case. They bankrupted can bankrupt the the bankrupted

01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:54.840
group had to sell its assets. The only top bidder was Scientology. So Scientology purchased can in

01:12:54.840 --> 01:13:00.520
1996. So whenever you call one of his old cult awareness network numbers in those books you would

01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:05.640
end up talking to a Scientologist. What are you going to do when they're trying to destroy you?

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:11.320
Look if you're a Jew if you're if you're a Jew no no Jew is going to cry about the fact that the

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:16.040
Nazi party is gone. If you're an African-American no one's going to cry that the KKK is gone.

01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:23.880
I'm not crying because can is gone. Yeah. Deprogramming still happens across the country

01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:30.280
although it's rare to find cases labeled as involuntary after the 1990s. I still do cases.

01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:35.160
The last case I did intervention case was in India. It was flown over there in September

01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:40.600
and that case turned out fine. Many ex-Rama students still appear to be in the computer

01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:45.800
programming industry. One former student is quoted as saying I don't agree with how he

01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:51.480
treated women. I don't think he was enlightened whatever that is. What I did get from him was a

01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:58.120
career. Others have turned their experience into cautionary tales. After leaving lenses

01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:03.960
organization I didn't get cancer. I didn't get into a car crash. Since then I've had a number of

01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:09.400
companies as an entrepreneur that I started and I moved up here to Maine and I built my own house

01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:13.560
with my wife. We just read books on how to build a house and we did it. And in the last 10 years

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:20.120
I've discovered a love for rediscovered a love for filmmaking and screenwriting. I wrote a bunch

01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:24.440
including the one I had mentioned before about two people falling in love as they try to save

01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:29.320
each other from their respective cults. It's a dark rom-com called the cult of us.

01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:36.120
But there may always be a market for the mystique of enlightenment as defined by those who

01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:42.360
claim to have achieved it and in a reality where only they can teach it. Someone might say oh yes

01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:45.640
Rama wonderful he's an enlightened teacher but gosh you know I just don't feel comfortable with him.

01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:52.600
I feel more comfortable with people that someone else whose name we won't mention. Why won't I

01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:56.920
mention it? Well you have to do some work. I mean there has to be some adventure here. Part of the

01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:01.640
test at least to get in is that you have to find them. It's hype and go see. And then you have to

01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:05.640
believe them. I mean I could just be making all of this up. Maybe I'm not enlightened. Maybe it's

01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:11.000
an extra double bluff where I'm just saying all this so you'll just think that I am. You see?

01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:14.760
Who can tell? You can tell. You can tell and your heart can tell.

01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:29.240
A big thanks to Jim Piccarello and Joe Zimhart. I wouldn't have been able to present this story

01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:34.280
nearly as comprehensively without their openness to sharing their experiences.

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:39.560
All day long from morning until night I thought about this dude. Check out the links in the

01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:44.360
description to find Joe's YouTube channel where he continues the cult monitoring work

01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:49.720
he's been doing for decades and Jim's short films which have won many awards in independent

01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:55.800
film festivals. I also want to give a shout out to a YouTube channel called Slave Obeyz.

01:15:55.800 --> 01:16:00.200
Without their efforts in archiving these talk shows from the 80s and 90s,

01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:05.240
important information about these groups would have been lost to time. And this isn't the first

01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:10.600
video of mine in which I've used archival clips from this channel so a shout out is long overdue.

01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:15.240
Lastly, if you enjoyed this video and would like to support the channel,

01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:21.000
my merch can be found at atrocityguide.com or you can support me directly on Patreon

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:26.840
where you'll get access to my Discord server as well as written progress reports on upcoming videos.
