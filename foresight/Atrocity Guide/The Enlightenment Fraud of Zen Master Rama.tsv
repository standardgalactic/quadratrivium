0	21920	When the famous actors, musicians, and athletes of the 1980s wished to cement their place
21920	27720	in American pop culture, they turned to celebrity photographer Harry Langdon.
27720	33840	One by one, he would direct their gaze into the camera, with their heads backlit in a glowing halo.
33840	38440	It was a look so many celebrities of the decade saw it, that one could hardly call
38440	45080	themselves a star if they hadn't been photographed by Harry Langdon.
45080	51720	But in 1984, a man named Dr. Frederick Lenz commissioned Langdon for a series of photoshoots.
51720	57260	The glamour shots that resulted began to appear across California, on college campus poster
57260	63100	boards, newspapers, and magazines, frequently filling up the entire printed page, but it
63100	72340	was unclear who Dr. Frederick Lenz was.
72340	77220	Some of his portraits would pose questions, others Dr. Lenz would devote to listing his
77220	82420	past lives, where he'd been a Japanese Zen master and a Tibetan Lama.
82420	87540	But his most widely circulated portrait would feature only his face, along with a simple
87540	106860	call to action, meditate with Rama.
106860	112940	Dr. Lenz seemed to appear out of nowhere, brute forcing his way into the public consciousness.
112940	118260	To the casual observer, his visibility campaign seemed nothing more than an advertisement
118260	120300	for meditation classes.
120300	125340	But to his hundreds of already existing students, his face was meant to reach those who'd
125340	130900	been followers of his for centuries, reminding them of who they really were, and calling
130900	134500	them back to him in order to finish their liberation.
134500	140460	We need to scour the globe for his students and reunite them, because we need to save
140460	144020	the world from some unknown evil, or the evil of the world.
144020	148780	For nearly two decades, Dr. Frederick Lenz would attempt to corral his followers and
148780	153900	lead them across America, away from the critics and away from family and friends who were
153900	156380	desperately trying to find them.
156380	161900	Lenz was a clever liar, he was entertaining, he presented himself as successful, and this
161900	168100	kind of loose Buddhism that he offered was appealing to a lot of young seekers that wanted
168100	170580	to make money and be like him.
170580	175660	In order to complete their liberation, each follower must master not only the disciplines
175660	184060	of the ancient world, but prove their supremacy in the modern world by climbing to the top
184060	189420	of America's most profitable industries, by any means necessary.
189420	193140	Most of them didn't know anything about coding, sometimes they'd get caught, but on
193140	196860	literal blacklist because they were destroying code.
196860	201500	To find out what it was like to be inside, I spoke with a former follower who joined
201500	204540	Lenz's organization when he was 20 years old.
204540	209620	Like if you were to ask like how deep did I go, I looked forward to jumping in front
209620	211900	of a bullet to save him.
211900	216620	I looked forward to that, I was like I can't wait till his life is on the line, and I'm
216620	218580	the one who gets to save him.
218580	223860	And one of Lenz's most committed public detractors who threatened to take it all away from him.
223860	226900	How many followers of Frederick Lenz did you attempt to deprogram?
226900	229500	It had to be at least 25.
229500	232340	How many of those would you say were successful?
232340	234500	I think all but four.
234500	240740	This is the story of Dr. Frederick Lenz, or as he was better known, Zenmaster Rama.
240740	246380	It was a psychological, potentially arguable, physical abusive relationship with this guy.
246380	255260	It was not as it was presented.
255260	257780	I'm a teacher of enlightenment.
257780	261060	That is to say, I'm enlightened.
261060	266540	And I enjoy being a vehicle of the expressions of the universe.
266540	271340	How did you happen to meet Frederick Lenz?
271340	277620	It started in college, where I was in my senior year, and I saw on the walls of my college
277620	282900	these beautiful, shiny posters about learn how to meditate from the Boston Meditation
282900	284340	Society.
284340	290740	So my fiance at the time and I went to one of these classes, and at first they talked
290740	294980	a lot about what, you know, we meditate so we can find enlightenment.
294980	299620	We can be calmer and more connected spiritually, and what historically those who have found
299620	305980	enlightenment like true enlightenment look like in our historical art, this sort of golden
305980	308420	glow in the paintings, right?
308420	312300	And so some of us who are spiritually sensitive enough when you're around one of these enlightened
312300	316820	beings, you can actually see the golden glow.
316820	317820	And I'm kind of nerdy.
317820	322020	So afterwards I would kind of go up and ask him questions and just say, you know, historically,
322020	324660	what was it like with blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
324660	330180	They were like, listen, we can tell that you are sort of, you vibe your aura or whatever
330180	333220	vibrates higher than most people.
333220	335900	You must have studied this in past lives.
335900	341860	Listen, we follow one of these guys that we think we believe is enlightened.
341860	344500	And we'd love you to check him out.
344500	350900	There is going to be a $500 a plate dinner in New York, and they were going to pay for
350900	351900	the whole thing.
351900	358140	We're like, listen, you know, we've got so much from this guy we follow named Dr. Frederick
358140	360420	Lenz or what we call is Rama.
360420	363420	We've gotten so much from we want to give back and we make tons of money.
363420	369260	So we're happy to pay your way and we were like, you know, cause we're like 20.
369260	371380	We all drive down together.
371380	376700	We go to this place and there's like 302 or 300 people there, all in tuxes and a lot
376700	381180	of them are doctors and lawyers and computer programmers and computer programmers and computer
381180	385140	programmers, which I noticed sort of a pattern in all of that.
385140	390460	And then this tall guy who has sort of like blondish curly hair, kind of like this, but
390460	391460	bigger.
391460	396100	At some point I saw him in like a leather jacket and like, you know, Ray Bands and
396100	400060	he did like a five minute monologue standup routine.
400060	407460	Now, in other words, meditation has been turned into a tool of the bourgeoisie.
407460	410460	No, I'm sorry.
410740	414300	Wrong incarnation.
414300	418340	I get, you know, I'm in different ones at different times and I got to bring it around
418340	419340	and get it straight.
419340	420340	Sorry.
420340	422980	So this is the, this is the right America.
422980	427180	And then he said, okay, everybody, let's, we're going to dim the lights and let's meditate
427180	429620	for those who haven't been with me before.
429620	431300	Don't close your eyes like you usually do.
431300	436780	Just like have a soft focus on me and open your eyes a little bit and watch me meditate.
436780	438420	You're not just watching me, the body.
438420	440580	You're watching the energy fields here.
440580	443580	You're relaxing your eyes, not looking too sharply, gazing.
443580	445780	I'm just watching.
445780	447900	You know, he just closed his eyes and he was doing a thing.
447900	449300	I don't remember.
449300	456820	And within 30 seconds or a minute, the whole room glowed gold and I got this wave of euphoria
456820	460660	that I never experienced before.
460660	469540	I was like, oh my God, if this dude can do that as an enlightened being in minutes, I'm
469540	474900	in for life.
474900	481740	This man can turn a room gold in 60 seconds, red one of lenses Bay Area advertisements.
481740	483980	Imagine what he can do to you.
483980	486740	It's a claim that would be echoed for years.
486740	487740	Turns the room gold.
487740	488740	That's all you see is gold light.
489180	492540	Kind of like if you looked into the sun and squirt.
492540	497020	Even decades later, it's difficult to find discussion of Frederick lens without someone
497020	500060	mentioning the golden light.
500060	503460	But not everyone had such a theatrical introduction.
503460	505940	What was it then Annie that made you go, wow?
505940	510300	Well, first of all, I didn't go, wow.
510300	511780	I listened to his presentation.
511780	512940	I thought he was witty.
512940	515660	I thought he was a nice person.
515660	518340	And I resonated with things he said that he said, let's meditate.
518340	519340	And I had a good meditation.
519340	521420	I had a very good meditation.
521420	527460	Dr. Lenz's brand of meditation was not unlike what was already beginning to catch on in
527460	532860	the West with the goal of achieving better focus and control over one's emotions by
532860	534780	quieting the mind.
534780	536940	Our mind is always in motion.
536940	539020	You'll notice you're always thinking something.
539020	543900	You're worried about tomorrow, paying the bills, we're thinking, images are flashing
543900	548060	through our mind, seeing somebody you'd like to see, remembering something that happened
548060	554940	in the past, our desires, our feelings, feeling guilty, feeling expectation.
554940	558560	Meditation is the opposite of that.
558560	561060	The basic technique is learned in seconds.
561060	565580	A student focuses their attention on the rise and fall of their breath or a place on their
565580	567020	body.
567020	572260	Keeping eyes closed is common, although Lenz often asked his students to look in his direction,
572260	574980	a technique he called gazing.
574980	579380	And when random thoughts intrude, the student gently brings their attention back to the
579380	580900	focal point.
580900	586700	I would wake up at like six in the morning, which I'd never done in my entire life.
586700	589660	And I would immediately meditate for 45 minutes.
589660	591620	I was so motivated and focused.
591620	598740	I was a 4.0 student for my last semester out of being a B minus student forever.
598740	602340	I would like to teach you to look into the depths of yourself, and I'm afraid you're
602340	603340	going to be shocked.
603340	606020	You're going to find out that you're much more beautiful than you realize.
606020	607980	I suddenly started loving running.
607980	610620	And so I would go for a run for two or three miles.
610620	611620	I'd come back.
611620	615380	If I didn't have school that day, I would work hard at work at friendly scooping ice
615380	618780	cream, but being super focused and being like the best I can be.
618780	623780	And that you can be happy even in the most adverse circumstances if you can do this one
623780	628620	thing, learn to make your mind quiet, still your thoughts.
628620	633180	Oh, and a lot of times I would meditate late at night and find that I really didn't need
633180	638260	a lot of sleep, so I'd be working extra hard reading books that he suggested I read on
638260	640020	top of all of my homework.
640020	647300	Because then it's as if a curtain opens, and behind that curtain is light, ecstasy, perfection,
647300	649140	beauty, and reality.
649140	650900	There's nothing to be afraid of.
650900	652220	There's only life.
652220	653860	And we all live forever.
653860	657580	So it's hard for someone to go, I think you're in something destructive because it doesn't
657580	663380	look that way in the beginning.
663380	669420	But in 1989, a computer programmer from Oregon named Brenda Kerber, who'd been a meditation
669420	674180	student of lenses for the past three years, went missing.
674180	678740	Others would disappear soon after, as well as students cutting off contact with their
678740	682940	families after they began attending lenses workshops.
682940	687660	This even surfaced of students giving up custody of their children in order to follow
687660	690500	the meditation group across the country.
690500	693500	My fiance and I, we lived together.
693500	697380	We went to Boston to meet with one of the inner circle.
697380	702460	And we had a dinner with him, and he talked about relationships and energy and stuff like
702460	703460	that.
703460	707620	And on the way home, we spontaneously, the both of us at the same time, realized we
707620	713580	shouldn't be together, because it's such a drain on our path to enlightenment.
713580	717980	And we talked about with glee, how we were going to split up all the stuff that we owned.
717980	722380	It's like, oh, you can get the CD, those CDs, and these CDs will be mine and those books
722380	723380	and my book.
723380	724380	It's like, do you want the better?
724380	725380	Do you want the couch?
725380	726820	She's like, I'll take the couch.
726820	730580	And then a few days later, and she was like, I don't want to leave, you know, I really
730580	731940	love you and I want to stay together.
731940	734300	And I was like, oh, you're so silly.
734300	736580	It's just going to destroy us.
736580	753460	So who was Dr. Frederick Lenz?
753460	759780	Frederick Lenz dedicated his first book titled Lifetimes, True Accounts of Reincarnation,
759780	762660	to an individual named Sri Chenmue.
762660	768020	In Lenz's second book, Sri Chenmue received not only the dedication, but credit for the
768020	773860	ideas presented in the book itself, disclosing that Lenz had been a student of Chenmue's
773860	775980	for the past 10 years.
775980	780100	Sri Chenmue continues to astound with his Hakeulian feats of strength.
780100	784580	A guru, a genuine guru, really genuine Sri Chenmue.
784580	788940	Sri Chenmue is our next guest on the program, and he is the holder of the United Nations
788940	793180	Medallion for Peace.
793180	798820	In 1970s Queens, New York, there were few local figures that baffled the media quite like
798820	804740	Chenmue Kumar Ghosh, who'd adopted the honorific title of Sri before leaving Bangladesh for
804740	806860	the United States.
806860	811700	After settling into Queens, Chenmue began putting his face on posters around college
811700	815900	campuses, offering free meditation classes to the public.
815900	821460	His following is nearly always described as increasing, and by the mid-70s, reporters
821460	827020	found that he'd accumulated hundreds of students, most of whom were college-aged.
827020	833540	Little by little, as we meditate every day and we see him twice a week, we notice, or
833540	842340	I notice, that I'm so happy and I feel God's presence so much of the time.
842500	847380	Chenmue attempted to be a living example of what a focused mind, conditioned by frequent
847380	852700	meditation, was capable of, and would invite local press to witness and perform endurance
852700	857020	challenges, which he called creative miracles.
857020	863980	The first was a 24-hour writing session where he produced 843 poems.
863980	870980	This works out to about 35 poems per hour, or a poem every 100 seconds.
881860	885820	We just don't know if there is a world's record for the number of paintings done in
885820	890820	the shortest possible time, but on tonight's edition of Bert Haney's People, he made just
890820	894300	a found that man a guru living in Queens.
894300	901500	The pace of his second challenge was more frantic, 16,000 paintings in 24 hours, averaging
901500	904260	now only a few seconds per piece.
904260	909420	I had no preconceived idea as to what I'm going to paint.
909420	915140	I just allow myself to be carried away by a higher force.
915140	920580	It's hard labor as well as an act of love, remarkable.
920580	925180	Through meditation, Chenmue claimed to have achieved what he called a oneness with the
925180	931020	Supreme, a type of psychedelic state he was known to spontaneously slip in and out of at
931020	932660	all times of the day.
932660	938860	I noticed as you were meditating, there was rapid eye movement on your part.
938860	945860	My consciousness was flying from one plane of reality to another.
945860	951300	This facial expression Chenmue adopted became the focal point of his group meditations,
951300	955540	with students staring into the flickering whites of his eyes as they cleared their minds
955540	956540	of thought.
956540	963380	Treat Chenmue as like a visitor from this other world to this world to show his followers
963380	965500	how to reach this other world.
965500	971700	At home, students would substitute with a photograph, as instructed by his 1978 meditation
971700	972700	manual.
972700	977620	Quote, the best type of meditation comes when you enter into my consciousness by looking
977620	982820	at a picture taken of me when I am in a high meditative consciousness, when I am one with
982820	984220	the Supreme.
984220	1007980	Do not think of it as a picture of a human being.
1007980	1012580	Chenmue would soon have enough of a following to pack out event rooms, where he would take
1012580	1018740	the stage, establish a oneness with the Supreme, and then deliver, to a crowd of thousands,
1018740	1035740	a new creative miracle.
1035740	1041340	In a single performance, Chenmue would sometimes cycle through a hundred or more instruments,
1041340	1046620	improvising melodies with each one just long enough to channel the Supreme, before moving
1046620	1060380	on to the next.
1060380	1067140	By the late 1970s, Chenmue's multi-sensory meditation experience had extended far beyond
1067140	1068140	Queens, New York.
1068300	1073020	There are over 125 Sri Chim Noi centers around the world.
1073020	1074020	What goes on in them?
1074020	1076500	What happens in the centers?
1076500	1081620	My students all over the world, wherever there are centers, they play and meditate, and they
1081620	1107180	read my writings, and also, as you know, I have composed thousands of songs.
1107180	1111780	Much of Chenmue's success was owed to the recruitment efforts of his students, and old
1111780	1116580	newspaper classified show that Frederick Len spent much of his early career as a traveling
1116580	1132900	meditation instructor, leading workshops on behalf of the Sri Chenmue centers.
1132900	1138260	He went by Atmananda, one of the Sanskrit nicknames that Chenmue had given to all of
1138260	1139940	those in his inner circle.
1139940	1144620	I decided to study with Sri Chenmue through Atmananda.
1144620	1148660	He was the number one disciple-bringer for Chenmue around the world.
1148660	1149660	He was very good at it.
1149660	1150660	He was a brilliant speaker.
1150660	1153660	Oh yeah, there's a definite battle between the light and the dark.
1153660	1154860	The network always wins, though.
1154860	1155860	We run the galaxy.
1156860	1163220	What was he a professor of, and where was he professing?
1163220	1169460	He was a professor of American literature at State University of New York at Stonybrook.
1169460	1175340	So I can only suggest that you learn to be what my friend Theodor Rutke called a perpetual
1175340	1181980	beginner, because if you feel that you're knowledgeable, you may be.
1181980	1185660	But to be a perpetual beginner is the happy part.
1185660	1189020	Being a student is much more fun than being a teacher.
1189020	1194540	Len's experience as a professor gave him a natural ease and authority over his college-aged
1194540	1196060	audience members.
1196060	1201780	And as he traveled the country gathering recruits, he began to realize an opportunity.
1201780	1206340	He would give a lecture for Chenmue to recruit people into Chenmue's circles.
1206340	1211700	At the very end, he'd be up there sitting cross-legged on the table, and he was channeling
1211820	1215460	the guru's spiritual light.
1215460	1221060	And he would look at people, and spiritual light would come out of his eyes, he would
1221060	1222060	say.
1222060	1226860	Well, that's a big no-no, because that is up for the big kahuna to do, not for the little
1226860	1229260	tiny atmananda to do.
1229260	1235740	And by 1980, Len's workshops were no longer associated with the Shri Chenmue centers,
1235740	1238520	but sponsored by his own organization.
1238520	1244440	He took off with a handful of other Shri Chenmue followers, convincing them that he was the
1244440	1247500	one and the master has kind of fallen.
1247500	1251720	As I grew up spiritually, as I entered into enlightenment, I saw the limitations of my
1251720	1256460	own teacher who was a very powerful occultist, but who I thought was, to some extent, limiting
1256460	1258480	others in their spiritual growth.
1258480	1262000	Come with me, I'm the new enlightened one.
1262000	1266400	It wouldn't be easy for Len's to rise out of Shri Chenmue's shadow.
1266400	1271600	Not only did Chenmue have the adoration of thousands, he'd been hosting weekly meditations
1271600	1274160	at the United Nations headquarters.
1274160	1278560	Every Tuesday, his students could watch him slip into the supreme in front of some of the
1278560	1281400	most influential people in the world.
1281400	1286180	In order to take followers away from Chenmue, Len's would need to establish himself as
1286180	1289120	a guru of greater merit.
1289120	1292600	What did Frederick Len say he was offering his students?
1292600	1297160	So he was offering his students spiritual energy.
1297160	1302640	At a certain point, I came to learn that we had studied with him specifically for hundreds
1302640	1309880	or thousands of lifetimes, and we've all grown towards enlightenment because of working
1309880	1310880	with him.
1310880	1315920	And so what he was offering his students was spiritual energy.
1315920	1320160	When I sit with my students and meditate with them, I channel the Kundalini, the energy,
1320160	1321160	directly into them.
1321160	1323960	I bring them through plane after plane of consciousness.
1323960	1327840	What they would do in a hundred years of meditation, I can do in an hour with them.
1327840	1328920	This was the spiel.
1328920	1331420	He'd give us spiritual energy.
1331420	1335360	We would go home with that spiritual energy and meditate better.
1335360	1337760	And I take the Kundalini and I play against the notes with it.
1337760	1340920	I kind of do a light show inwardly and outwardly.
1340920	1344920	With the energy, with vortexes of energy, as you sit there, opening you up, opening up
1344920	1349160	different parts of you that maybe you haven't felt since you were a child, it's no big deal.
1349160	1350720	It's just what I do.
1350760	1355360	And when Lenz announced his separation from Chenmoy, it's reported that he was able
1355360	1360420	to siphon about 40% of the students in attendance.
1360420	1366320	But even without his star recruiter, Chenmoy's following only increased throughout the 1980s,
1366320	1370640	and his students were beginning to perform creative miracles of their own.
1370640	1377600	In 1986, the world record for most consecutive underwater pogo stick jumps was surpassed.
1377600	1383360	The new champion used his platform as an opportunity to promote the three Chenmoy centers.
1383360	1387880	Elsewhere in New York, a student shattered the record for continuous hand clapping with
1387880	1391040	50 hours of non-stop applause.
1391040	1395040	And he did so, he said, to honor his guru.
1395040	1402440	By 1982, Chenmoy claimed to have completed over 140,000 paintings, as well as over 4,000
1402440	1411240	musical compositions.
1411240	1415080	Lenz would need his own way of showing the fruits of his enlightenment.
1415080	1420520	Now, I have written a number of pieces of music to meditate to.
1420520	1424520	I asked the Zen master, what is dancing?
1424520	1426520	Dancing.
1426520	1428520	Dancing.
1428520	1430520	Dancing.
1430600	1436600	Lenz was Lenz's rock, new age band.
1436600	1439800	And he was credited as writing all the songs.
1439800	1442200	And I would listen to them all the time.
1442200	1443400	All the time.
1443400	1446200	I mean all the time.
1446200	1448600	It is moving to the right.
1448600	1451960	Lenz was joined by three of his students to form Zazen.
1451960	1456600	And throughout the 1980s, they produced a number of albums with tracks like
1456600	1459800	Death is Sexual and Gandalf the Wizard.
1459800	1464280	I loved listening to it, but I was, you know, controlled to love listening to it.
1464280	1465640	It was actually fine music.
1465640	1466680	It was perfectly good.
1466680	1469160	This music is composed in other dimensions.
1469160	1470760	That's where I go to compose it.
1470760	1473800	And then it's brought here into this world from the planes of light.
1473800	1475880	And it's played by some of my students.
1475880	1480600	Chenmoy had become well-known for drawing talented musicians into his orbit.
1480600	1485960	Guitarist Carlos Santana and John McLaughlin both spent much of their early careers making
1485960	1488440	music dedicated to the Supreme.
1488520	1494040	Zazen was stacked with talent as well, with Grammy-nominated Joaquin Lievenow providing
1494040	1495160	lead guitar.
1495160	1498840	And Lenz would incorporate this music into his live workshops,
1498840	1502520	often using it as a focal point for group meditations.
1502520	1505240	And I go through the music that they've played with my aura.
1505240	1506840	We'll wash out anything impure.
1506840	1508680	So there's only light in the music.
1508680	1510120	It's perfect music.
1510120	1513880	Students were asked to demonstrate their spiritual growth as well.
1513880	1519640	Lenz required the submission of essays, detailing each student's progress in their twice daily
1519640	1525960	meditations and several supplementary disciplines such as the reading and re-reading of recommended
1525960	1529960	books and martial arts taught by Sensei Lenz himself.
1529960	1532920	Martial arts is an ancient science.
1532920	1535400	It was codified by Buddhist monks.
1535400	1540440	He would wear a gi, you know, the karate white gi with a black belt.
1540520	1543000	And they both looked like they had just come out of the package.
1543000	1545240	They still had the folds all over them and stuff like that.
1545240	1549080	I will be extending an invisible energy field that we call the key
1549080	1551880	that we gain from deep meditation and samadhi.
1556920	1559240	This has rarely been seen outside of the Orient.
1562120	1563480	There's nothing she can do.
1563480	1564600	Is there anything you can do?
1564600	1567400	His inner circle would run at him and he'd go,
1567400	1569880	huh, like that with his hands and then they'd fall down.
1569880	1572920	What I want to do is interfere with their minds.
1573480	1575480	The mind is the ultimate weapon.
1575480	1579160	So they're going to come at me and I'm just going to project a wave of energy out of my body
1579160	1580040	to disable them.
1580040	1580680	Right?
1580680	1580920	Good.
1580920	1581080	Okay.
1581080	1581960	Come at me.
1581960	1582520	Come.
1582520	1582840	Say.
1585960	1586600	One more time.
1586600	1587480	Come at me.
1587480	1588040	Come.
1588040	1588520	Say.
1592520	1595640	For a moment, a wave of energy sweeps through their body
1595640	1597000	and they don't know where they are.
1597000	1599000	What world they're in, what dimension they're in.
1599480	1600680	It's embarrassing.
1600680	1601880	It's cringy.
1601880	1602200	Right?
1602200	1603320	How bad it was.
1603320	1606040	But man, did it look good when I was under mind control.
1606040	1606760	Holy shit.
1606760	1607640	That guy could move.
1608440	1611560	Len seemed to take the strictness of routine from Chen Moy
1611560	1615800	who frequently enrolled his students in marathons to advertise the center
1615800	1620680	and was known for waking his students up at 3 a.m. for morning meditations.
1620680	1624920	But Len's took what he called a Western-oriented approach to enlightenment.
1624920	1629400	If students weren't progressing in their careers and increasing their salaries,
1629400	1632360	they weren't making full use of his spiritual energy.
1639560	1643000	In this modern world, the more money you make,
1643000	1645880	it's the better meditation you're having.
1645880	1650920	It's difficult to find a consistent membership price for Len's meditation group.
1650920	1656920	The introductory seminars are usually advertised as either free or for a small cover charge.
1656920	1658920	But as attendees became regulars,
1658920	1664760	tuition could range anywhere from $600 a month to $2,500 a month.
1664760	1666360	I believe it was $20 a month.
1666360	1666840	Really?
1666840	1667400	Yeah.
1667400	1668600	Is that what you pay?
1668600	1669240	No.
1669240	1671640	Since then, my career has advanced significantly
1671640	1673960	and I pay approximately $1,000 a month now.
1673960	1678360	For me, it started free and then it was like a sliding scale.
1678360	1683880	Like if you could pay $100 a month, $500 a month, that would be helpful.
1683880	1688760	And it got to the point where I might have been paying $3 or $500 a month scrambling.
1688760	1693960	To cover the ever-increasing tuition, students were encouraged to switch careers.
1693960	1699320	And at Len's's suggestion, many of them turned to the fledgling field of computer programming.
1699320	1703720	A person who meditates who becomes a programmer is kind of like a duck in a happy pond.
1704680	1708120	You're in the right situation for many, many reasons.
1708120	1714920	He believed or he taught that computer programming was very similar to really good meditation
1714920	1716760	because of where your brain goes.
1716760	1722280	Computers are fascinating because the mindset necessary to work with advanced structures
1722280	1727000	in programming and in design is exactly what we do in advanced meditation.
1727000	1728760	It's exactly the same mindset.
1728840	1735720	I had credit cards at age 20, 21 that I was maxing out because of the promise of,
1735720	1738280	just in a few months, you're going to be making $100,000 a year,
1738280	1741000	which was an unbelievable amount of money back then.
1741000	1745480	According to ex-followers, Len's told his students that they'd all been software
1745480	1750280	developers together in past lives in the lost city of Atlantis.
1750280	1753960	And he appears to have registered a corporation under the title
1753960	1758920	High Priest of the First Diocese of the Californian Church of Atlantis.
1758920	1761880	The computers in Atlantis were infinitely evolved.
1761880	1765400	All processing was done with light. Electricity's much too slow.
1765400	1770600	But if his students had known how to code thousands of years ago, they would need a refresher.
1770600	1774520	If you're not familiar with the world of programming, you might take a simple course in it,
1774520	1776200	and then there are two ways to plunge into it.
1776200	1780440	One is to go to a short-term computer school where you go for six months or nine months or a year,
1780440	1782760	either during the day full-time or in the evening.
1782760	1786440	He talked a lot about the importance of programming computers and artificial
1786440	1791480	intelligence and relational databases, which is like a three- or four-D
1791480	1793880	database instead of like a flat spreadsheet, right?
1793880	1796840	I'm a nerd, so I kind of understood it, and there were lots of people who were like,
1796840	1800040	I don't know what he's saying, but they like worked really hard to figure it out.
1800040	1802920	Was Len's knowledgeable about computer programming?
1802920	1805480	As far as I know, he was like a Steve Jobs.
1805480	1810040	He understood the root of mentoring stuff, but he was just trying to inspire people
1810120	1812680	to go out and make a great deal of money.
1812680	1814840	Obviously, it's a smart career choice.
1814840	1819480	It's our country's number one business now, and it will only become more so.
1819480	1824440	But not every student waited until they knew how to code before entering the field.
1824440	1829800	A pattern began to form of students packing out their resumes with proficiencies and programming
1829800	1834760	languages, enlisting one another as previous employers who would vouch for them.
1834760	1838440	If you don't have experience, come up with the names of some companies.
1838440	1842520	Then you have somebody say, yes, they worked for me there, a friend.
1842520	1846200	Most of them didn't know anything about coding, and they would use each other
1846200	1852280	as references onto their resume and list all of the computer programming jobs they've had,
1852280	1853240	which they never did.
1853240	1855640	With the intention that they were going to do the best job they had,
1855640	1859160	and they had this enlightened being's energy, so they should be able to persevere.
1859160	1863160	So what normally would take four or eight hours at their work, they would work
1863160	1868440	12, 14, 16 hours looking at books, copying code, doing all of this stuff that they could
1868440	1871480	until they actually started understanding it usually.
1871480	1874840	The girl that I worked with at City Corp, who was doing this, was on the phone all the time
1874840	1878600	with her, with the other people in the cult, and she would use me as a source of information.
1878600	1882680	She would ask me questions that were totally unrelated to her specific job.
1882680	1885480	They were obviously, she was trying to help these other people.
1885480	1887960	So basically, it would be the blind leading the blind.
1887960	1892920	Sometimes they'd get caught, put on a literal blacklist because they were destroying code.
1893160	1898120	As one newsletter that circulated among the industry's hiring managers stated,
1898120	1903160	lenses followers were, quote, inserting themselves virus-like on accounts in the
1903160	1906440	tri-state area where they proceeded to wreak havoc.
1907000	1911080	But not all who lied their way into these companies were exposed.
1911080	1915720	Many learned the software languages quickly enough to begin rising the ranks into high
1915720	1921720	income positions, and they were advised to use this money to reinvest in their enlightenment.
1921720	1924920	You get more money, which tells you how more enlightened you are.
1924920	1931240	And since we're simple monks, we give this money back to him as a gesture of thank you.
1933240	1937160	And then he takes the money as the gesture, and then he gives us more spiritual energy,
1937160	1941960	which lets us meditate better, to program code better, and then give him more money.
1941960	1944760	To study enlightenment requires a commitment.
1944760	1948040	And part of that commitment is a person's willingness to go out and work to make the
1948040	1949880	money to pay for their own way.
1949880	1954760	How much money do you think you spent involved with Zen Master Rama?
1954760	1959720	In cash layouts, for the five-month involvement from January to May 1985,
1959720	1962920	I gave out a little over $30,000 in cash.
1962920	1966520	And an exceptional person, of course, will pay even more, will give even more,
1966520	1969160	because they not only want to just pay for their own way,
1969160	1973000	but they wish to make enlightenment more available to others.
1973000	1976760	Because you were a spiritual student of his, and you'd come to him and go,
1976760	1980760	I have this great idea for a computer program or, you know, a database program.
1981480	1986680	He would become CEO of every single one, like dozens of these companies.
1989000	1994680	Lenz credited himself with developing software through the 1980s and 90s that he claimed was
1994680	1999160	used by hundreds of American companies, both commercial and military.
1999800	2003880	And it's reported that some of his more successful programmers were providing
2003880	2007400	Lenz with upwards of $5,000 per month each.
2007400	2011880	If I were to keep on going and had a full-time job out of college,
2011880	2018040	I would have been paying as much as I could, $1,000 a month, which was a lot, $2,000 a month,
2018040	2025640	and living with a number of other Lenz followers by sleeping on floors or packing into rooms.
2025640	2030600	So we didn't have much overhead in eating ramen or just vegetables or whatever,
2031320	2034280	and then giving him essentially all of our money.
2034280	2039800	Did he ever, in any of his seminars, you know, verbally justify how he could ask that much?
2040760	2045320	Lenz would say that at his level, and the amount of energy he had,
2045320	2051240	there are so many people who want him dead, maybe from the government or these unknown
2051240	2054280	evil people, or they just wanted to steal his energy.
2054280	2060680	He needs to hide himself out and in planes fight protecting himself in impeccable locations
2060680	2066040	that sat on like vortexes or energy centers that the earth naturally gives,
2066040	2071000	and also surround himself with other high-class things that energetically
2071000	2076040	contain his energy and protect him from this dangerous world.
2076600	2081800	By 1988, Lenz was purchasing million-dollar homes across the United States
2081800	2084600	in order to bring enlightenment to a wider audience.
2085160	2089960	I can work anywhere I want in the world. I can do what I want to,
2089960	2096040	when I want to, buy or not buy what I want to, and I have a good understanding of art,
2096040	2101320	literature, mathematics, geography, computer science, and the world.
2101960	2107320	I know a lot about people. I'm not a bigot, and I try and help people out whenever I can,
2107320	2110440	but I'm also street smart. I know the street real well.
2112760	2118680	By the end of the 1980s, Lenz had begun to elicit a fair amount of attention from journalists.
2118680	2122120	LA Weekly published a several thousand-word expose,
2122120	2128600	making it the centerpiece of the January 28th, 1988 issue with this illustration as the cover.
2129560	2134040	There's a newspaper in Los Angeles called the LA Weekly that ran a story called Busting Rama.
2134040	2137960	I didn't know that there was anything to but. I mean, I don't understand what the problem is.
2137960	2141240	I teach seminars. They're very mainstream. I do them at Lincoln Center and every
2141320	2145640	talk about me. The authors interviewed several ex-followers for the expose,
2145640	2150760	marking one of the first times Lenz was publicly confronted with the more extraordinary claims
2150760	2155160	he had convinced his students to believe. I want to see if some, any things are correct.
2155160	2159800	Followers say that you make rooms glow with golden light. You can make the moon change colors,
2159800	2165000	the star spin, the wind stop. We should all be so lucky. Sounds like they're talking about Jesus
2165000	2169400	Christ here today. It does to me. Are you denied having ever climbed any of this? Of course not.
2169400	2173000	If you meet an enlightened person, you will see, if you have the ability to see on a subtle
2173000	2177160	physical level, a beautiful golden light around them. Oh, you may see many other things.
2177160	2181960	You claim to be one of the 12 fully enlightened beings on this planet? No, of course not.
2181960	2187560	In my estimation, at this time, there are 12 fully enlightened teachers in this world of which I am one.
2188200	2192920	Lenz claimed to be one of the 12 enlightened beings on earth. Do you know what he meant by that?
2192920	2199480	Yeah, people who have evolved for like, come, uh, incarnated for thousands of incarnations
2199480	2202600	who have studied Buddhism at a certain point, you get to a point like a,
2202600	2208520	like a Buddhist or a Jesus state, right? Where you're so enlightened and connected to the universe
2209320	2215800	that you're at the top. Are you one of the 12 enlightened beings on earth? I am an enlightened
2215800	2220840	teacher and it would take about an hour to explain what that means. Who are the other 11?
2221560	2226440	Well, there's a very well-known gentleman in India called Satya Sai Baba and so on and so
2226440	2231880	forth, names you wouldn't even know. It was almost a threat if you think about it. If it's not him,
2231880	2236760	there's a good chance you're not going to find the other ones. You really lucked out or you were
2236760	2243560	meant to find him. Other claims include Lenz telling his followers that he could stop breathing while
2243560	2247400	in deep meditation. When you go into Samadhi, very often you won't breathe for half an hour,
2247400	2253320	an hour. There's no breath at all. And something called blisses, this line of puppets that Lenz
2253320	2260920	had imbued with spiritual energy. What does this have to do with Zen master Rama? Anyone want to
2260920	2266120	just jump in here? It's fun. I can guess it's called a bliss and you've got them in your
2266120	2271720	apartment and part of the things they do is get rid of demons. Question. Hold on, hold on.
2271720	2277160	But the most alarming revelation in the busting Rama expose was what Lenz did to many of the
2277160	2282280	women in the group. We're not really having sex at all. It's an exchange of energy.
2283240	2288520	As a young man in Lenz's circle, did he treat you any differently from the women in the group?
2288520	2295240	I wasn't aware of it at the time, but the answer is yes. So what was happening behind the scenes
2295800	2304920	was that he would pick out some woman or young woman and convince them that if they had sex with
2304920	2311960	him, it's actually like a tantric way of him viewing them with spiritual energy. The greatest
2311960	2317800	transfer, karmic transfer, occurs in aside from meditating with someone, in sex with someone.
2317800	2323480	He said that he had sex with many of his women students. It was strictly a spiritual exercise
2323480	2331960	designed to energize me and raise my awareness level up to a higher realm. I actually heard that
2331960	2338200	some of his inner circle were convincing new people to do the same thing because they were higher
2338200	2346120	than everybody else. I talked to one guy after the fact after we were both out and his girlfriend was
2346120	2350680	one of those people and they broke up because of it and he left the group not because he didn't
2350680	2357080	believe that he was unenlightened and he was a fraud. He actually left because this feels
2357080	2363800	unequal because there's no option for him to have sex or some equivalent with this guy.
2363800	2369560	Throughout the 1980s, much of Lenz's advertising campaign appeared to be aimed exclusively toward
2369560	2375800	women. He has somewhat of a radical, very pro-women liberation point of view. It's days for him to
2375800	2381640	tell us as women how we can attain greater enlightenment. Good morning, welcome to our show.
2382600	2387000	From a point of view of meditation, let's say that women have an inner power that men don't. We
2387000	2392440	know that women's bodies are stronger than men. They can endure greater temperature changes,
2392440	2397400	heat, cold. There are physiological differences, but from a psychic point of view, women just have
2397400	2404200	a stronger energy. They can bear more and endure more. By the end of the decade, Lenz had accumulated
2404200	2410440	over a thousand followers with a high tuition inner circle of nearly 400 dedicated members.
2410440	2416920	The group had spread over the country with meditation bases in Palo Alto, Malibu, New York,
2416920	2423480	and Boston. You originally started in New York. You moved to San Diego. You had you
2423480	2427800	asked people to follow you from New York to San Diego. You asked some of those people to follow
2427800	2432520	you from San Diego to Malibu. Now, I had a meditation center in San Diego, Los Angeles,
2432520	2438040	and San Francisco. That's true. I've never asked anyone to move anywhere. Did Lenz ever ask his
2438040	2444600	followers to move or relocate with him? Yes. There would be rumblings for a few weeks or a
2444600	2450200	month or two like the Exodus is coming up. My first Exodus was when we went from Boston to
2450200	2456360	Los Angeles or to Chicago. I can't remember the places. You would leave all your friends and
2456360	2462440	family and everyone you ever knew like they were old clothes that don't fit anymore. When you show
2462440	2467160	up to this new place, you're finally free of the past. You get to reinvent yourself.
2468440	2474120	Instead of talking to your family members, you can give them their beeper number. So,
2474120	2480920	you're like connected, but you never respond to the beeper number. I was preparing for mine
2480920	2486600	and saving money by living in my parents' house while I was working full-time to disappear to New
2486600	2493720	York and just disappear, not even say goodbye. Gone. There are certain places. We call them places
2493720	2499880	of power on the earth. These are fabulous places. These are places where there's more energy available.
2499880	2506360	For some reason, when you meditate in these places, it's easier to stop your thoughts. There was a
2506360	2511800	time limit hidden from the concerned family and friends who might be considering an intervention.
2511800	2517480	If they didn't act quickly, they might lose the opportunity for good. But without an understanding
2517480	2522440	of what these students were experiencing, many interventions went nowhere. He asked,
2522440	2529480	so, Mark, are you getting involved in a cult? And I said, no, Rabbi, I'm studying spiritual
2529480	2538440	mysticism. And he sort of looked at me and he said, well, Judaism is a set of laws and we don't
2538440	2545880	deal with that stuff. What the students of Frederick Lenz really needed was expert intervention.
2545880	2550040	Would you mind introducing yourself and giving it a description of what it is that you do?
2550040	2557560	Yeah, hello. My name is Joe Simhart. I'm known as a cult information specialist. Since 1980,
2557560	2563880	I've helped people, families, the media understand the cult problem. I've done interventions that
2563880	2570680	were called the programings or exit counselings, approximately 500 or more. I also have a career
2570680	2576600	in the fight arts. Joe Simhart was a recurring voice of opposition throughout Frederick Lenz's
2576600	2582280	career. In the late 80s, he publicly confronted Lenz on the talk show A Current Affair.
2582280	2587880	What does he do that creates such loyalty? Well, for one thing, he sets himself up as
2587880	2593400	something that he is not. A Zen master, an enlightened being, a person who can traverse
2593400	2599960	in the occult world at will. I do two night a month seminars that a person attends and may or
2599960	2604920	may not attend again. I don't see how this race is occult. Joe's interest in this field came
2604920	2610520	organically. Throughout the 1970s, he'd been a member of the Apocalyptic Church Universal and
2610520	2617240	Triumphant, led by the charismatic Guru Ma, who claimed to be, quote, God incarnate.
2617240	2623000	In unraveling that whole thing and deconstructing what I had been involved in, I became kind of an
2623000	2629400	expert in the field of fundamentalist Christianity, New Age cult, Strait Buddhism, self-help groups,
2629400	2634760	all kinds of things that are related to this sort of activity. The programmers and exit counselors
2634760	2640760	got to know about me and asked me to go on cases with them. So I got, I guess, good at it at doing
2640760	2645240	conflict resolution with families that were impacted by this. And quite a few people would
2645240	2649480	leave these cults after talking to me, sometimes for several hours, sometimes for a week.
2651000	2653800	When did Frederick Lenz first appear on your radar?
2654360	2660760	In 1986, a family called me from California complaining that their daughter had just got
2660760	2666280	home and she was a mess and had been living with Frederick Lenz Rama for three months at his place
2666280	2673400	in Long Island. They flew me out and I spent a week with their daughter and she filled me in on
2673400	2678920	Lenz's behavior. He had her take LSD and she said during the first trip she ever did on LSD,
2678920	2684680	he began to scream and yell at her for failing him, for not being respecting him as an enlightened
2684680	2690680	person and she was devastated and suicidal, he left her alone in the house. Sadie's used as a
2690680	2695640	woman, you know her? Sure do. She says she was seduced by you, you made her a mistress, she says
2695640	2699640	you encouraged her to use LSD, try to make her believe she was possessed by demons, told her she
2699880	2704920	was the only one who could save her from the dark. She called a friend that came to pick her up and
2704920	2711560	called her family and they got her on a plane and sent her home and so I helped her to deconstruct
2711560	2717720	or debrief her about what happened to her, you know, what cults are about, what narcissistic
2717720	2722520	leaders are about, the fact that Lenz didn't appear to be enlightened and his claim to be in
2722520	2727880	light was just a claim to be entitled. Well she ran away, that's true, that's bad, this is someone
2727880	2732440	I spent some time with, a young woman, a very beautiful young woman who I went out with and
2732440	2736840	we traveled together for a while and had a great time together, she seemed to have an obsession
2736840	2742920	as some people do with demons, it was unfortunate, I liked her very very much, I thought she was just
2742920	2748440	super. That started my career with him, one of his mistresses and subsequently I had Exit Council
2748440	2754600	of about five other mistresses of his and about 20 other members. What were the greatest challenges
2754600	2759560	in deprogramming a devoted follower of Lenz? Yeah so the difficulty is just getting the whole
2759560	2764440	conversation started and once a person realizes that it's all about their choice, you know,
2764440	2770200	they can stay in the group forever if they wish to for every reincarnation or they could even
2770200	2775160	talk it out and see what I had to say or what the ex-member I had with me had to say, you know,
2775160	2779880	over time in most of those cases on the third day the person was ready to defect from the group.
2779880	2784280	Joe was often joined in these interventions by former students of Lenz,
2784280	2789720	many of whom Joe had Exit Counciled himself and when they weren't assisting in deprogrammings,
2789720	2795160	these ex-followers could be found protesting outside of Lenz's seminars. Could you describe
2795160	2799640	some of the common characteristics of a Rama student? Most of them were quite attractive,
2799640	2804600	young, intelligent, they could have been successful in business, you know, higher than
2804600	2809720	average IQ, lower than average IQ about comparative religions and another understanding
2809720	2815800	what Buddhism was really about so he could fool them as far as that aspect of spirituality and
2816600	2823320	you know, hungry for either spiritual enlightenment or success. The unenlightened can only take you
2823320	2828120	to the beach because they can't bring you across the ocean. God can do that directly if that's the
2828120	2833640	will of eternity or God will do that through the voice and the guidance of what we call an enlightened
2833640	2839240	person. It's this exchange between the narcissist and the hero-hungry person. The narcissist becomes
2839240	2845560	a foil like a movie that they can watch and feel part of and they join that guru on this stage.
2846680	2851160	You get kind of caught up in it, it becomes a self-ceiling social system and anything that's
2851160	2856120	critical of that self-ceiling social system is considered ignorant or evil or some other
2856120	2860040	thought-terminating cliche that prevents the person from thinking about the criticism.
2860040	2865640	During television appearances, Joe was often captioned as being affiliated with an organization
2865640	2870200	called the Colt Awareness Network. You know, this guy's not the head of the Colt Awareness Network.
2870200	2875800	Our eyes is a programmer who's hired to do kidnappings for $50,000 a hit. Can, as it would be
2875800	2883080	called, formed following the Jonestown massacre of 1978 when spiritual leader Jim Jones coerced over
2883080	2888680	900 followers to ingest cyanide in what he called a revolutionary suicide.
2889240	2893800	We cannot afford to forget what happened in Jonestown, said Cann's initial director.
2894360	2900120	They had annual conferences. The basic function was to disseminate information about controversial
2900120	2905000	groups. There was a time if you were worried about your son or daughter being an occult,
2905000	2910360	you could get help from a small non-profit organization called the Colt Awareness Network,
2911320	2915720	one follower of Lenz described the Colt Awareness Network as, quote,
2915720	2922680	utterly vicious people who prey on others religious freedom. Lenz himself told Newsday that, quote,
2922680	2926760	Cann is to small religious groups what the KKK is to black people.
2926760	2931720	If anything is a cult, it's the Colt Awareness Network, and I will tell you that. That is a cult.
2931720	2937800	I think Lenz is an individual who craves power. I think Lenz is an individual who has found how
2937800	2943880	to manipulate people to satisfy his craving for power. There's an organization that calls itself
2943880	2950040	the Colt Awareness Network, and they put families in touch with kidnappers who go out and grab these
2950040	2957640	people, sometimes 25 to 50 grand a shot is paid by wealthy parents. There were only two cases that
2957640	2965160	I can recall regarding Lenz, two young ladies that began coercively where the family had kidnapped
2965160	2971960	them and flew me in after securing them to try to talk them to leave Lenz. And both of those
2971960	2978520	cases didn't work, unfortunately, but all the voluntary cases I did with his followers did work.
2978520	2985880	One of those women was Jennifer Jacobs. Yes. I had me locked in this hotel for 11 days until
2985880	2991640	I ring out my police system. Okay, I am 22 years old. I'm a legal adult. They have no right. They
2991640	2999800	can be concerned all the while, but they have no man right to kidnap me. In the September 18, 1992
2999800	3005800	issue of the Philadelphia Enquirer, a woman named Jennifer Jacobs published a letter to the editor
3005800	3010680	in response to an exposé the Enquirer had published the previous week called,
3010680	3017320	As Guru's Disciples Hit Town Critics Cry Beware, the author of the exposé interviewed Jennifer's
3017320	3022040	parents and they were quoted saying that since joining Lenz's meditation group,
3022040	3027480	their daughter had stopped speaking to them and quote, no longer has a sense of humor and has
3027480	3033640	stopped playing the piano, a passion she had since childhood. Jennifer had written to tell her side
3033640	3041720	of the story, quote, in 1987, my parents paid $25,000 to have me brutally kidnapped, locked in
3041720	3048440	captivity, terrorized and abused for 11 days in a filthy motel in what was euphemistically called
3048440	3055480	an involuntary deprogramming, end quote. She used similar language in our affidavit, naming her
3055480	3062520	parents as complicit in the kidnapping and Joe as among the two deprogrammers. I read the affidavit
3063800	3069320	she accused can of kidnapping her and holding her against her will in a hotel room for 11 days
3069320	3075480	in an effort to deprogram her. Is there truth to that? Well, can of the call to awareness network
3075480	3079720	had nothing to do with it. Number one, they didn't hire the programmers and they didn't
3079720	3085400	manage them even though people that did interventions attended can conferences and would do some
3085400	3092360	networking but can didn't approve of kidnapping programming. So that was wrong. I'm trying to
3092360	3096680	think of a, I don't remember if it went 11 days, I think it probably went like a week.
3097640	3103960	She went to a rehab center afterwards, you know, agreeing to go and which was for ex-called members
3103960	3109800	and she escaped from there or left it because you could, it was voluntary and she went back
3109800	3114280	to the group and after that we heard all this negative stuff about the experience.
3114920	3120920	That is a potent self-righteous man and that is the attitude of the whole call to awareness network.
3120920	3125960	She was quite angry, her family ended me. I've since met with her after she broke away from
3125960	3132920	lens and we've reconciled all of that. In 1992, Joe was quoted saying, I don't recommend coercive
3132920	3136920	situations anymore because there's too much trauma involved for everyone.
3147960	3152440	Hello power lovers. I'm here today on top of the continental divide.
3153240	3160280	11,500 feet up above the earth. I'm parked by the side of the road. It's around 745
3161080	3166200	in the evening on August 7th. Occasionally a car or truck will roar by.
3169240	3177960	I'm facing some distant power mountains, a suitable place to discuss with you the end of the world.
3178920	3185000	By the 1990s, Frederick Lenz's career had entered a precarious phase. On the surface,
3185000	3189640	things seemed to be trending in his favor. He published his first novel titled,
3189640	3194840	Surfing the Himalayas, the story of a young spiritual aspirant and a zen master named
3194840	3199960	Flop who set out to snowboard their way to enlightenment. Now, your book is about a lot
3199960	3204520	more than snowboarding. I mean, in this case, the perfect ride is really about spiritual
3204600	3209400	enlightenment, isn't it? Well, snowboarding is spiritual enlightenment. Snowboarding is the
3209400	3213640	fastest growing sport in the world and in five years there are going to be more people on snowboards
3213640	3218920	than on skis. But yes, you're absolutely right. Snowboarding is about balance. The novel sold
3218920	3225320	90,000 copies. It was even publicly endorsed by Chicago Bull's head coach, Phil Jackson,
3225320	3229880	who quickly whiffed through the blurb after backlash from the Chicago Tribune.
3229880	3236520	The sequel, Snowboarding to Nirvana, also sold well. Enrolling stone after reading the latest
3236520	3241960	coverage of Pearl Jam's battle with Ticketmaster and flipping past all the ads for CD subscription
3241960	3247880	services, readers would find Lenz's face with two full-printed pages dedicated to
3247880	3253080	promoting the new Zazen album. There's also what must have seemed a reassuring amount of
3253080	3258840	web-hosted fan pages that appeared around this time, but Lenz's reputation at large
3258840	3266040	only continued to plummet. In 1993, ex-follower Mark Laxer released a memoir called Take Me for
3266040	3271720	a Ride. The book details how Lenz convinced his students that Sri Chenmoy couldn't actually
3271720	3277240	achieve Samadhi, the deepest state of meditation in which union with the Supreme is reached,
3277240	3282120	and had only been faking it for clout. And how Mark and other male students were
3282120	3287640	dissuaded from even speaking to the women in the group for fear of bringing down their energy
3287640	3293720	while Lenz himself was privately pursuing them. Laxer's impetus for leaving the group was the
3293720	3300120	passing of a student named Donald Cole, who'd named Lenz in the note he left behind. Cole had
3300120	3306920	been among the 400th students purged by Lenz for, quote, maintaining an abysmal level of consciousness.
3306920	3311800	There were times where he, irrationally, I mean, these were people, three or five hundred people,
3311800	3316280	who'd be giving him tens of thousands of dollars, like constantly, and he would just get rid of half
3316280	3320600	of everyone. He would just, like, wipe everybody out. Sometimes a spiritual teacher will literally
3320600	3325080	kick out some of their best students because it's time for them to go out and experience for a while
3325080	3329720	in the world. Sometimes a student just isn't doing well. They're knocking their head against the wall.
3329720	3333000	Well, if you're a good teacher, you don't let them keep knocking their head against the wall.
3333000	3337880	They hurt themselves. You send them out for a while. People would be sobbing. Lenz was
3337880	3342920	simultaneously threatening to use his spiritual energy against students who left the group of
3342920	3350360	their own accord. It is possible that he could give me cancer or, as I'm driving late at night,
3350920	3357400	alone. My card is my flip. Do you know how Lenz would dissuade his followers from leaving his group?
3357400	3362440	Well, there was a lot of dark forces out there, according to him, and that without his protection,
3362440	3367640	you will fall into insanity. Your life will collapse. You won't have a chance for enlightenment for
3367640	3373800	many lifetimes. Now that you're sort of connected with his energy spiritually, if you were to leave
3373800	3380120	your body is so kind of addicted or connected that you would quickly fall into the lower levels,
3380120	3386120	kind of the hell levels of existence, in which case you'd go crazy. You'd get cancer. You'd get
3386120	3391640	into a car accident. About three years out of the group, I still believe he could do that. He could
3391720	3398440	stop my heart. He could cause a car accident. But the 1990s saw Lenz's opposition ramping up as well.
3398440	3403320	X students managed to get his novels dropped from Barnes & Noble promotional events,
3403320	3408520	and reports surfaced of a group of parents called LenzWatch, who worked synergistically with the
3408520	3413800	Cult Awareness Network in order to find students and connect them with exit counselors. For more
3413800	3418600	information about Lenz and his followers, you can contact the Cult Awareness Network or a group
3418600	3424360	called LenzWatch. I had told my mother, whatever you do, if the Cult Awareness Network gives you
3424360	3428760	a call and tries to convince you that I'm in a cult, just hang up on them. They're going to try
3428760	3433400	to deprogram me and try to get tons of money out of you. And then I walked away and she said,
3433400	3439320	the Cult Awareness Network, that sounds legit. So she called them and it turns out one of the top
3439320	3446120	cult interventionists or exit counselors lived just three towns away or five times away. And
3446120	3449720	I still thought that they were going to be full of shit, but I was like, I might as well listen
3449720	3454600	to what they have to say. My friends are there, my family is there, this guy who's the cult expert,
3454600	3461560	and a few ex-members are all there. And they show me videotapes of Scientology, the boonies,
3461560	3467800	and stuff like that. And I want to say three or four hours into just talking and learning about
3467800	3475720	mind control and other cults. I had the sensation of popping out of it. It was like, pop. And I
3475720	3481640	looked around and I was like, oh my God, you have no idea the shit I believed. Oh my God,
3481640	3486760	it was like waking up from a year, year and a half long dream and having the memories of a
3486760	3494360	totally different person. I actually had my stepfather drive down to where my ex-fiancé,
3494360	3498360	and she was still in it, drove down after the first day, picked her up, brought her down,
3498360	3504120	and I shared the intervention with her. And so she would pop out of it. She was not as dedicated
3504280	3508280	as I was, but there was still the mind control going on with her.
3509400	3516680	In 1996, Dateline NBC delivered a critical blow to Lenzi's career, a primetime expose,
3516680	3521640	this time featuring an ex-member of Zazen, who was quick to call Lenzi out for sharing
3521640	3527800	songwriting credits with the band. I never, in my definition of composition and writing,
3527800	3531400	saw him write anything. What does he play? He doesn't play anything.
3532040	3536360	The film crew captured a Zazen jam session, showing what Lenz
3536360	3539160	psychically cleansing the music looked like in action.
3542920	3544920	Now let's go in the opposite way down.
3551320	3552200	Can I get funky?
3552680	3561960	He was apparently using a lot more drugs. I mean, he used LSD,
3561960	3567000	uppers and downers, and from one inside person told me he had also been using cocaine.
3567000	3571160	And he looked, you know, the last time he was on television was on Dateline program.
3571160	3576120	It was very thin. I got this Caucasian body and it's created all kinds of problems in the
3576120	3580280	West. I've never had one before. It's a new experience. I mean, it's to being shorter
3581000	3587000	and being in a land where I am understood. He wasn't as effective as an influencer
3587560	3591240	the last couple of years, and I think a lot of followers began to break away from him.
3592040	3595720	The segment also featured a newly defected Jim Piccarello,
3595720	3599880	who at times seemed stunned by his own story as he recounted it.
3599880	3605320	I thought that this guy can turn the room into gold. I was pretty much into it at the
3605320	3609960	beginning of the dinner. By the end of the dinner, I was willing to hang out with that group for
3609960	3615080	pretty much the rest of my life. Over time, not only did I see him turn the room gold,
3615080	3621000	which I saw it every single time during a retreat, a desert retreat. I saw him at night
3621000	3627160	skate on beams of light, you know, over the sand. Oh, I saw him disappear. I've seen him turn into a
3627160	3633240	woman into a Princeton's weird bug-like creature. I've seen them levitate. In the very beginning,
3633240	3638280	what did they do? They had us get into a trance state by meditating. And then they would talk about
3638280	3645080	what the experience is when you're with a enlightened being and you are spiritually sensitive.
3645080	3649480	A, you want to be spiritually sensitive and want to be better than other people. You're a person.
3649480	3654040	B, you're interested in being with an enlightened master. Because how cool would that be? You're
3654040	3658360	a special person who's learning stuff that no one else is learning. You're in a room with
3658360	3663240	300 people that believe this guy is enlightened. You've got the group dynamics that are shaping
3663240	3668200	your experience. And then when he comes out and he lowers the lights and gets you into
3668200	3672680	a state and you have a belief like, I want to be special. I want to follow someone who's special.
3673400	3681240	Start experiencing what they describe historical enlightened beings are like. And I saw gold.
3687080	3693000	In the early spring of 1998, Long Island police pulled the body of Frederick Lenz from the bottom
3693000	3699160	of a bay located behind one of his New York homes. A local reporter described a small crowd of
3699160	3704760	onlookers who'd gathered to watch the scene and the leading hypothesis that Lenz had been killed
3704760	3710040	by the parent of a student, someone who'd felt Lenz had, quote, brainwashed their kids.
3710600	3715800	Adding to this theory was a section of damaged railing along the pier where it was determined
3715800	3721640	Lenz entered the water. But when the body was recovered, they found Lenz dressed in a Versace
3721640	3728120	suit with a dog collar buckled around his neck. The Scotty dog had died years before in a volume.
3728120	3733480	He had that dog collar on his neck. He claimed the buyer was his most enlightened student and
3733480	3737560	that they had been together many times in past lives. I mean, this is how delusional he was.
3738520	3744120	Inside Lenz's home were two other Scottish terriers and one student. The dogs were in
3744120	3750680	critical condition, having eaten volume that was hidden inside their dog food. The student had also
3750680	3756520	taken lethal amounts of barbiturates and was found staring at a framed photo of Lenz with a note
3756520	3762920	beside her that read, we all tried to go to the other world last night and only Rama made it.
3762920	3768120	Please help us make it to the other world. The woman was discovered by the housekeeper
3768120	3773720	when she came in and she got help and survived this overdose and so did the dogs by the way.
3774680	3781720	After a toxicology report found that Lenz had ingested 150 tablets of value mixed with Vodka
3781720	3785400	prior to drowning, his death was deemed self-inflicted.
3792920	3799560	Beyond this world, beyond other worlds, be they interdimensional worlds or physical worlds,
3799640	3806040	there is something else which is that vast unknown that we call eternity. It is where we have come
3806040	3813240	from. It is that which is within us and it is where we eventually return. I can't tell you what that
3813240	3820680	is like. I have meditated and experienced that. I have tasted it and felt it. Then I went beyond
3820680	3827000	that to become it. The widespread reactions of followers to Lenz's death have mostly been lost
3827000	3832520	to time, but archived message boards show students sharing photos of group memorials
3832520	3837400	and a sudden urgency to reconnect with other members they might not have seen in years.
3838120	3843080	Oh, I actually found out about his death at my wedding. I was walking around with my friend Bob who
3843080	3848120	was involved in my intervention and we're walking around he goes oh what did you think about Lenz
3848120	3854680	dying and I was like what? I was just surprised that he tried to kill other beings which is so
3854680	3860760	un Buddhist. I was like okay well one less cult leader in the world. I was in my mid 20s. I didn't
3860760	3869000	have a lot of empathy for incredibly abusive sociopaths. Hi, my name is Rama and today I would
3869000	3874120	like to teach you how to meditate. Lenz never groomed a successor to lead the meditation group
3874120	3879880	in his absence. On the contrary, he'd been adamant that none of his students had come close to
3879880	3884600	achieving a level of consciousness that could be called enlightenment. So when my friends write me
3884600	3888840	and tell me they're enlightened, it's like someone who's just taken a second year French
3888840	3894120	course announcing that they've just completed their PhD. So the group continued without a living
3894120	3900440	figurehead. Today the few remaining and incoming students have virtual meetups to discuss Lenz's
3900440	3906200	teachings or to watch his favorite movies. Some meditate on framed portraits of him they keep
3906200	3913320	in their homes. Others simulate his golden light with augmented reality and clips from his VHS tapes
3913320	3918520	will occasionally appear while scrolling YouTube shorts. When you meditate over a period of time
3918520	3924040	you'll come to see more and more of the many faces and sides of creation and in this one brief
3924040	3929800	lifetime you can experience ecstasy thousands and thousands of times. Why do you think someone like
3929800	3935960	Rama even after all these years still has a loyal fan base? There are other groups that are
3936040	3940680	selling his halt. One of the ones that's most successful these days is run by a guy they
3940680	3946360	call himself Sampara who's a lens offshoot or a Rama offshoot. His real name is Jeff Malone,
3946360	3951720	G-E-O-F-F Malone and his group's called the Buddha Dojo and it was called Awaken Mind at one time.
3951720	3956760	But it's very lens-like. When people approach that group they don't know that lens is behind it
3956760	3962120	and they might never know but once you get deeply involved then you get its reveal that lens is the
3962120	3968200	Guru. You know it's just like in his day the seekers out there that want to believe that there's
3968200	3972760	people out there that are enlightened and they think that if they come across one they'll recognize
3972760	3977480	this person you know they all use this line when the the seeker is ready the Buddha will appear.
3978440	3982840	That's that line that's slow but it's probably gotten more and people into bizarre cults at
3982840	3988440	least Eastern groups than any other because people in their own narcissism think that they will have
3988440	3994680	this insight or this psychic power to recognize a real guru when they see one. It was lens's will
3994680	4000920	that is net worth which included several houses and cars totaling around 18 million dollars be
4000920	4007080	used to establish a charity in his name with the objective of quote disseminating Zen Buddhist
4007080	4013080	teachings meditation and yoga in the context of what I have taught as American Buddhism.
4013080	4018680	The Frederick P. Lenz Foundation for American Buddhism still exists today and claims to give
4018680	4025640	millions to Buddhist friendly causes across the world. In 2013 a follower named Liz Lewinson
4025640	4032040	crowdfunded 29,000 dollars in order to write a biography of Frederick Lenz titled Gaze in my
4032040	4039640	direction. It was New Year's Eve 1998 and he said to me you will be my biographer three months
4039640	4046280	later he was gone he staged his exit. Lewinson's account of Lenz covers much of the same time period
4046280	4052280	as Mark Laxer's memoir but the tone couldn't be more different. She describes the change of stage
4052280	4058360	names as Lenz incarnating into the Hindu god Rama. I don't like calling him Rama it's an insult to
4058360	4063640	those who actually follow either Hinduism or Buddhism and Lenz's reasons for breaking away
4063640	4069480	from Chinmoy having largely to do with Chinmoy's strict rule of celibacy. I went through terrible
4069560	4075560	times I went through times of self-hate thinking how undeveloped spiritually I was everyone else in
4075560	4079720	the ashram a thousand people nobody had a girlfriend or a boyfriend I did.
4087880	4094200	Sri Chinmoy never had the reputational downfall that Lenz experienced. Around the time of Lenz's
4094280	4099480	death the Chinmoy centers around the world were celebrating the completion of seven million bird
4099480	4105640	drawings. Chinmoy's students continued performing endurance challenges throughout the decades.
4105640	4111800	By the 1990s powerlifting had become Chinmoy's preferred method of demonstrating the supreme.
4111800	4117320	Whether he was calf raising a helicopter or an elephant or wrist curling a giant dumbbell
4117320	4121880	he always kept the cumulative weight prominently displayed for the audience to consider.
4122440	4125080	Go Guru come on up yes.
4127240	4132600	Occasionally he would combine his creative miracles for a show stopping finale.
4132600	4136440	Over close to 1500 books it gives you just a brief idea of how prolific
4136440	4139560	Guru is. He has written close to 1500 different books.
4145720	4151480	Chinmoy's sheer quantity of creative output has always been seen as dubious by those outside of
4151480	4158200	his meditation centers. And some of his more outlandish feats such as this lift listed at over
4158200	4165080	7,000 pounds were difficult for even his most loyal adherents to believe. But Chinmoy had a
4165080	4171640	seasoned defense. I don't blame people who suspect my performance he said my own mind suspects it.
4172360	4179480	When Chinmoy passed away in 2007 at the age of 76 the way he was eulogized in the media
4179480	4187080	couldn't have been more different from that of Frederick Lenz. Then in 2015 13x followers converged
4187080	4193160	to form a youtube channel called the Sree Chinmoy Disciple Experience. And you know it's very scary
4193160	4197400	and very daunting especially when you hear all the horror stories that Guru used to tell Sree
4197400	4200520	Chinmoy say oh if you leave the center you know you're gonna want them you're gonna get raped
4200520	4204840	you're gonna get cancer you're gonna the hostile force they're gonna capture. You know that was
4204840	4210600	like my only family because I had to cut off my real family for 21 years. I just had pretty much
4210600	4216120	resigned myself that that was it for this life you know just many times Guru said it's just one
4216120	4221400	incarnation and I thought to myself okay fine I can just give one incarnation for this. Being in
4221400	4226520	the meditation center was very much about trying not to be human. Certain parts of the being like
4226520	4231320	between here and here and everything else was meant to be dead. Targeted out by having me sit in
4231320	4236280	front of him and meditate and then he was like saying are you surrendered and I have my hands full
4236280	4242120	and I said supreme I bow to thee and then he was like oh are you really surrendered and then he
4242120	4256600	said take your clothes off. Unconditional surrender to the will of the supreme. The last development
4256680	4263240	of the story of Frederick Lenz came in 2021 when the remains of Brenda Kerber a programmer and
4263240	4270440	meditation student who disappeared in 1988 were recovered. Her car had been driven into a reservoir
4270440	4276200	and act that police ruled intentional. She'd given up custody of her kids before her disappearance
4276200	4281480	and her diary entries indicate it was so she could move across the country to follow Lenz
4281480	4283960	who she referred to as golden boy.
4289560	4295320	So the cult awareness network seems to have dissolved in the late 1990s. Can you talk about
4295320	4301960	what happened? So uh Scientology was one of the groups that really went after any group that
4301960	4307320	criticized them and and especially hated the cult awareness network. They sued the can group 50
4307320	4314280	times. I got hit with 12 suits in one week. I would open the door a process server would give
4314280	4319800	me a suit. They were suing us all over the country sometimes simultaneously. There was a case in
4319800	4326600	the early 1990s where the programmer named Rick Ross took on a case in west it was a fundamentalist
4326600	4332520	Christian group where he takes a counsel teenage sons of a woman out of a group and then she wanted
4332520	4338840	her then 18 year old son exit counseled also and it didn't work. He had been kidnapped. He went
4338840	4343640	back to the group. Scientology got a hold of the young man and got him to run a lawsuit against
4343640	4350600	the cult awareness network based on the fact that Rick Ross had some vague connection to uh can even
4350600	4356280	though he didn't attend the meetings. Scientology's lawyers were quite adept at this kind of case
4356920	4361480	where can didn't have good representation because it was poorly funded and they couldn't afford
4361480	4368760	a good legal team. Scientology won the case. They bankrupted can bankrupt the the bankrupted
4368760	4374840	group had to sell its assets. The only top bidder was Scientology. So Scientology purchased can in
4374840	4380520	1996. So whenever you call one of his old cult awareness network numbers in those books you would
4380520	4385640	end up talking to a Scientologist. What are you going to do when they're trying to destroy you?
4385640	4391320	Look if you're a Jew if you're if you're a Jew no no Jew is going to cry about the fact that the
4391320	4396040	Nazi party is gone. If you're an African-American no one's going to cry that the KKK is gone.
4396040	4403880	I'm not crying because can is gone. Yeah. Deprogramming still happens across the country
4403880	4410280	although it's rare to find cases labeled as involuntary after the 1990s. I still do cases.
4410280	4415160	The last case I did intervention case was in India. It was flown over there in September
4415160	4420600	and that case turned out fine. Many ex-Rama students still appear to be in the computer
4420600	4425800	programming industry. One former student is quoted as saying I don't agree with how he
4425800	4431480	treated women. I don't think he was enlightened whatever that is. What I did get from him was a
4431480	4438120	career. Others have turned their experience into cautionary tales. After leaving lenses
4438120	4443960	organization I didn't get cancer. I didn't get into a car crash. Since then I've had a number of
4443960	4449400	companies as an entrepreneur that I started and I moved up here to Maine and I built my own house
4449400	4453560	with my wife. We just read books on how to build a house and we did it. And in the last 10 years
4453560	4460120	I've discovered a love for rediscovered a love for filmmaking and screenwriting. I wrote a bunch
4460120	4464440	including the one I had mentioned before about two people falling in love as they try to save
4464440	4469320	each other from their respective cults. It's a dark rom-com called the cult of us.
4470280	4476120	But there may always be a market for the mystique of enlightenment as defined by those who
4476120	4482360	claim to have achieved it and in a reality where only they can teach it. Someone might say oh yes
4482360	4485640	Rama wonderful he's an enlightened teacher but gosh you know I just don't feel comfortable with him.
4485640	4492600	I feel more comfortable with people that someone else whose name we won't mention. Why won't I
4492600	4496920	mention it? Well you have to do some work. I mean there has to be some adventure here. Part of the
4496920	4501640	test at least to get in is that you have to find them. It's hype and go see. And then you have to
4501640	4505640	believe them. I mean I could just be making all of this up. Maybe I'm not enlightened. Maybe it's
4505640	4511000	an extra double bluff where I'm just saying all this so you'll just think that I am. You see?
4511560	4514760	Who can tell? You can tell. You can tell and your heart can tell.
4514760	4529240	A big thanks to Jim Piccarello and Joe Zimhart. I wouldn't have been able to present this story
4529240	4534280	nearly as comprehensively without their openness to sharing their experiences.
4534280	4539560	All day long from morning until night I thought about this dude. Check out the links in the
4539560	4544360	description to find Joe's YouTube channel where he continues the cult monitoring work
4544360	4549720	he's been doing for decades and Jim's short films which have won many awards in independent
4549720	4555800	film festivals. I also want to give a shout out to a YouTube channel called Slave Obeyz.
4555800	4560200	Without their efforts in archiving these talk shows from the 80s and 90s,
4560200	4565240	important information about these groups would have been lost to time. And this isn't the first
4565240	4570600	video of mine in which I've used archival clips from this channel so a shout out is long overdue.
4571560	4575240	Lastly, if you enjoyed this video and would like to support the channel,
4575240	4581000	my merch can be found at atrocityguide.com or you can support me directly on Patreon
4581000	4586840	where you'll get access to my Discord server as well as written progress reports on upcoming videos.
