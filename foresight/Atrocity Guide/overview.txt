Checking Atrocity Guide/The Enlightenment Fraud of Zen Master Rama.txt
1. **Rick Ross and the Cult Awareness Network (CAN):** Rick Ross, who had no formal connection to the Church of Scientology, was sued by the organization in the mid-1990s due to his criticisms. CAN, which provided resources for those affected by cults, was bankrupted as a result of the lawsuit and subsequently sold to Scientology in 1996.

2. **Jim Piccarello and Cult Monitoring:** Jim Piccarello, formerly known as Rama, founded the Lens Organization and later Can West Comprehensive Services. He has been involved in various lawsuits related to his work with cults and deprogramming. Joe Zimhart, an ex-member of the Lens Organization, has been monitoring cults for decades and has had a significant impact on the lives of former members.

3. **Cult Deprogramming:** Although less common after the 1990s, deprogramming still occurs in some cases. Joe Zimhart has worked on intervention cases, including one in India in September 2022, which had a positive outcome.

4. **Aftermath for Former Lens Organization Members:** Many former members of the Lens Organization have gone on to successful careers post-deprogramming. One ex-member became an entrepreneur and built a house with his wife, while another found a new passion in filmmaking and screenwriting, writing a screenplay about falling in love while trying to save each other from their respective cults.

5. **Enlightenment Claims:** The allure of enlightenment as claimed by self-proclaimed enlightened teachers continues, with individuals seeking guidance and spiritual growth. Skepticism is important when evaluating such claims, and personal discernment is crucial.

6. **Resources and Support:** Joe Zimhart's YouTube channel provides ongoing cult monitoring work, and archival clips from the 80s and 90s are available on the Slave Obeyz YouTube channel.
