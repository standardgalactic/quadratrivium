1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,920
When the famous actors, musicians, and athletes of the 1980s wished to cement their place

2
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,720
in American pop culture, they turned to celebrity photographer Harry Langdon.

3
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,840
One by one, he would direct their gaze into the camera, with their heads backlit in a glowing halo.

4
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,440
It was a look so many celebrities of the decade saw it, that one could hardly call

5
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:45,080
themselves a star if they hadn't been photographed by Harry Langdon.

6
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:51,720
But in 1984, a man named Dr. Frederick Lenz commissioned Langdon for a series of photoshoots.

7
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:57,260
The glamour shots that resulted began to appear across California, on college campus poster

8
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:03,100
boards, newspapers, and magazines, frequently filling up the entire printed page, but it

9
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:12,340
was unclear who Dr. Frederick Lenz was.

10
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:17,220
Some of his portraits would pose questions, others Dr. Lenz would devote to listing his

11
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,420
past lives, where he'd been a Japanese Zen master and a Tibetan Lama.

12
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:27,540
But his most widely circulated portrait would feature only his face, along with a simple

13
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:46,860
call to action, meditate with Rama.

14
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:52,940
Dr. Lenz seemed to appear out of nowhere, brute forcing his way into the public consciousness.

15
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:58,260
To the casual observer, his visibility campaign seemed nothing more than an advertisement

16
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,300
for meditation classes.

17
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:05,340
But to his hundreds of already existing students, his face was meant to reach those who'd

18
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,900
been followers of his for centuries, reminding them of who they really were, and calling

19
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,500
them back to him in order to finish their liberation.

20
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:20,460
We need to scour the globe for his students and reunite them, because we need to save

21
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:24,020
the world from some unknown evil, or the evil of the world.

22
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:28,780
For nearly two decades, Dr. Frederick Lenz would attempt to corral his followers and

23
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:33,900
lead them across America, away from the critics and away from family and friends who were

24
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,380
desperately trying to find them.

25
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:41,900
Lenz was a clever liar, he was entertaining, he presented himself as successful, and this

26
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:48,100
kind of loose Buddhism that he offered was appealing to a lot of young seekers that wanted

27
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,580
to make money and be like him.

28
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:55,660
In order to complete their liberation, each follower must master not only the disciplines

29
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:04,060
of the ancient world, but prove their supremacy in the modern world by climbing to the top

30
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:09,420
of America's most profitable industries, by any means necessary.

31
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,140
Most of them didn't know anything about coding, sometimes they'd get caught, but on

32
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,860
literal blacklist because they were destroying code.

33
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:21,500
To find out what it was like to be inside, I spoke with a former follower who joined

34
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,540
Lenz's organization when he was 20 years old.

35
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:29,620
Like if you were to ask like how deep did I go, I looked forward to jumping in front

36
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,900
of a bullet to save him.

37
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,620
I looked forward to that, I was like I can't wait till his life is on the line, and I'm

38
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,580
the one who gets to save him.

39
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:43,860
And one of Lenz's most committed public detractors who threatened to take it all away from him.

40
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,900
How many followers of Frederick Lenz did you attempt to deprogram?

41
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,500
It had to be at least 25.

42
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,340
How many of those would you say were successful?

43
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,500
I think all but four.

44
00:03:54,500 --> 00:04:00,740
This is the story of Dr. Frederick Lenz, or as he was better known, Zenmaster Rama.

45
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:06,380
It was a psychological, potentially arguable, physical abusive relationship with this guy.

46
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:15,260
It was not as it was presented.

47
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,780
I'm a teacher of enlightenment.

48
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:21,060
That is to say, I'm enlightened.

49
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:26,540
And I enjoy being a vehicle of the expressions of the universe.

50
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:31,340
How did you happen to meet Frederick Lenz?

51
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:37,620
It started in college, where I was in my senior year, and I saw on the walls of my college

52
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,900
these beautiful, shiny posters about learn how to meditate from the Boston Meditation

53
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,340
Society.

54
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:50,740
So my fiance at the time and I went to one of these classes, and at first they talked

55
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,980
a lot about what, you know, we meditate so we can find enlightenment.

56
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:59,620
We can be calmer and more connected spiritually, and what historically those who have found

57
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:05,980
enlightenment like true enlightenment look like in our historical art, this sort of golden

58
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,420
glow in the paintings, right?

59
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:12,300
And so some of us who are spiritually sensitive enough when you're around one of these enlightened

60
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,820
beings, you can actually see the golden glow.

61
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,820
And I'm kind of nerdy.

62
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:22,020
So afterwards I would kind of go up and ask him questions and just say, you know, historically,

63
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,660
what was it like with blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

64
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:30,180
They were like, listen, we can tell that you are sort of, you vibe your aura or whatever

65
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,220
vibrates higher than most people.

66
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,900
You must have studied this in past lives.

67
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:41,860
Listen, we follow one of these guys that we think we believe is enlightened.

68
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,500
And we'd love you to check him out.

69
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:50,900
There is going to be a $500 a plate dinner in New York, and they were going to pay for

70
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,900
the whole thing.

71
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:58,140
We're like, listen, you know, we've got so much from this guy we follow named Dr. Frederick

72
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,420
Lenz or what we call is Rama.

73
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,420
We've gotten so much from we want to give back and we make tons of money.

74
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:09,260
So we're happy to pay your way and we were like, you know, cause we're like 20.

75
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,380
We all drive down together.

76
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:16,700
We go to this place and there's like 302 or 300 people there, all in tuxes and a lot

77
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,180
of them are doctors and lawyers and computer programmers and computer programmers and computer

78
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,140
programmers, which I noticed sort of a pattern in all of that.

79
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:30,460
And then this tall guy who has sort of like blondish curly hair, kind of like this, but

80
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,460
bigger.

81
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:36,100
At some point I saw him in like a leather jacket and like, you know, Ray Bands and

82
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:40,060
he did like a five minute monologue standup routine.

83
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:47,460
Now, in other words, meditation has been turned into a tool of the bourgeoisie.

84
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,460
No, I'm sorry.

85
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,300
Wrong incarnation.

86
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,340
I get, you know, I'm in different ones at different times and I got to bring it around

87
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,340
and get it straight.

88
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,340
Sorry.

89
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,980
So this is the, this is the right America.

90
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:07,180
And then he said, okay, everybody, let's, we're going to dim the lights and let's meditate

91
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,620
for those who haven't been with me before.

92
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,300
Don't close your eyes like you usually do.

93
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:16,780
Just like have a soft focus on me and open your eyes a little bit and watch me meditate.

94
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,420
You're not just watching me, the body.

95
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,580
You're watching the energy fields here.

96
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,580
You're relaxing your eyes, not looking too sharply, gazing.

97
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,780
I'm just watching.

98
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,900
You know, he just closed his eyes and he was doing a thing.

99
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,300
I don't remember.

100
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:36,820
And within 30 seconds or a minute, the whole room glowed gold and I got this wave of euphoria

101
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:40,660
that I never experienced before.

102
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:49,540
I was like, oh my God, if this dude can do that as an enlightened being in minutes, I'm

103
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:54,900
in for life.

104
00:07:54,900 --> 00:08:01,740
This man can turn a room gold in 60 seconds, red one of lenses Bay Area advertisements.

105
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,980
Imagine what he can do to you.

106
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,740
It's a claim that would be echoed for years.

107
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,740
Turns the room gold.

108
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,740
That's all you see is gold light.

109
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,540
Kind of like if you looked into the sun and squirt.

110
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:17,020
Even decades later, it's difficult to find discussion of Frederick lens without someone

111
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:20,060
mentioning the golden light.

112
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,460
But not everyone had such a theatrical introduction.

113
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,940
What was it then Annie that made you go, wow?

114
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:30,300
Well, first of all, I didn't go, wow.

115
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,780
I listened to his presentation.

116
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,940
I thought he was witty.

117
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,660
I thought he was a nice person.

118
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:38,340
And I resonated with things he said that he said, let's meditate.

119
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,340
And I had a good meditation.

120
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,420
I had a very good meditation.

121
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:47,460
Dr. Lenz's brand of meditation was not unlike what was already beginning to catch on in

122
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:52,860
the West with the goal of achieving better focus and control over one's emotions by

123
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,780
quieting the mind.

124
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,940
Our mind is always in motion.

125
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,020
You'll notice you're always thinking something.

126
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:03,900
You're worried about tomorrow, paying the bills, we're thinking, images are flashing

127
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:08,060
through our mind, seeing somebody you'd like to see, remembering something that happened

128
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:14,940
in the past, our desires, our feelings, feeling guilty, feeling expectation.

129
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,560
Meditation is the opposite of that.

130
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,060
The basic technique is learned in seconds.

131
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,580
A student focuses their attention on the rise and fall of their breath or a place on their

132
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,020
body.

133
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:32,260
Keeping eyes closed is common, although Lenz often asked his students to look in his direction,

134
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,980
a technique he called gazing.

135
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,380
And when random thoughts intrude, the student gently brings their attention back to the

136
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,900
focal point.

137
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:46,700
I would wake up at like six in the morning, which I'd never done in my entire life.

138
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,660
And I would immediately meditate for 45 minutes.

139
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,620
I was so motivated and focused.

140
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:58,740
I was a 4.0 student for my last semester out of being a B minus student forever.

141
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:02,340
I would like to teach you to look into the depths of yourself, and I'm afraid you're

142
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,340
going to be shocked.

143
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,020
You're going to find out that you're much more beautiful than you realize.

144
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,980
I suddenly started loving running.

145
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,620
And so I would go for a run for two or three miles.

146
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,620
I'd come back.

147
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:15,380
If I didn't have school that day, I would work hard at work at friendly scooping ice

148
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,780
cream, but being super focused and being like the best I can be.

149
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:23,780
And that you can be happy even in the most adverse circumstances if you can do this one

150
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:28,620
thing, learn to make your mind quiet, still your thoughts.

151
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:33,180
Oh, and a lot of times I would meditate late at night and find that I really didn't need

152
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:38,260
a lot of sleep, so I'd be working extra hard reading books that he suggested I read on

153
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,020
top of all of my homework.

154
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:47,300
Because then it's as if a curtain opens, and behind that curtain is light, ecstasy, perfection,

155
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,140
beauty, and reality.

156
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,900
There's nothing to be afraid of.

157
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,220
There's only life.

158
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,860
And we all live forever.

159
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:57,580
So it's hard for someone to go, I think you're in something destructive because it doesn't

160
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:03,380
look that way in the beginning.

161
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:09,420
But in 1989, a computer programmer from Oregon named Brenda Kerber, who'd been a meditation

162
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:14,180
student of lenses for the past three years, went missing.

163
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:18,740
Others would disappear soon after, as well as students cutting off contact with their

164
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:22,940
families after they began attending lenses workshops.

165
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:27,660
This even surfaced of students giving up custody of their children in order to follow

166
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,500
the meditation group across the country.

167
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,500
My fiance and I, we lived together.

168
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,380
We went to Boston to meet with one of the inner circle.

169
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:42,460
And we had a dinner with him, and he talked about relationships and energy and stuff like

170
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,460
that.

171
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:47,620
And on the way home, we spontaneously, the both of us at the same time, realized we

172
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:53,580
shouldn't be together, because it's such a drain on our path to enlightenment.

173
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:57,980
And we talked about with glee, how we were going to split up all the stuff that we owned.

174
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:02,380
It's like, oh, you can get the CD, those CDs, and these CDs will be mine and those books

175
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,380
and my book.

176
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,380
It's like, do you want the better?

177
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,380
Do you want the couch?

178
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,820
She's like, I'll take the couch.

179
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:10,580
And then a few days later, and she was like, I don't want to leave, you know, I really

180
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,940
love you and I want to stay together.

181
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,300
And I was like, oh, you're so silly.

182
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,580
It's just going to destroy us.

183
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:33,460
So who was Dr. Frederick Lenz?

184
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:39,780
Frederick Lenz dedicated his first book titled Lifetimes, True Accounts of Reincarnation,

185
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,660
to an individual named Sri Chenmue.

186
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:48,020
In Lenz's second book, Sri Chenmue received not only the dedication, but credit for the

187
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:53,860
ideas presented in the book itself, disclosing that Lenz had been a student of Chenmue's

188
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,980
for the past 10 years.

189
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:00,100
Sri Chenmue continues to astound with his Hakeulian feats of strength.

190
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,580
A guru, a genuine guru, really genuine Sri Chenmue.

191
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:08,940
Sri Chenmue is our next guest on the program, and he is the holder of the United Nations

192
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:13,180
Medallion for Peace.

193
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:18,820
In 1970s Queens, New York, there were few local figures that baffled the media quite like

194
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:24,740
Chenmue Kumar Ghosh, who'd adopted the honorific title of Sri before leaving Bangladesh for

195
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,860
the United States.

196
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:31,700
After settling into Queens, Chenmue began putting his face on posters around college

197
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,900
campuses, offering free meditation classes to the public.

198
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:41,460
His following is nearly always described as increasing, and by the mid-70s, reporters

199
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:47,020
found that he'd accumulated hundreds of students, most of whom were college-aged.

200
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:53,540
Little by little, as we meditate every day and we see him twice a week, we notice, or

201
00:13:53,540 --> 00:14:02,340
I notice, that I'm so happy and I feel God's presence so much of the time.

202
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:07,380
Chenmue attempted to be a living example of what a focused mind, conditioned by frequent

203
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:12,700
meditation, was capable of, and would invite local press to witness and perform endurance

204
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:17,020
challenges, which he called creative miracles.

205
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:23,980
The first was a 24-hour writing session where he produced 843 poems.

206
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:30,980
This works out to about 35 poems per hour, or a poem every 100 seconds.

207
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:45,820
We just don't know if there is a world's record for the number of paintings done in

208
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:50,820
the shortest possible time, but on tonight's edition of Bert Haney's People, he made just

209
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,300
a found that man a guru living in Queens.

210
00:14:54,300 --> 00:15:01,500
The pace of his second challenge was more frantic, 16,000 paintings in 24 hours, averaging

211
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,260
now only a few seconds per piece.

212
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:09,420
I had no preconceived idea as to what I'm going to paint.

213
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:15,140
I just allow myself to be carried away by a higher force.

214
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:20,580
It's hard labor as well as an act of love, remarkable.

215
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:25,180
Through meditation, Chenmue claimed to have achieved what he called a oneness with the

216
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:31,020
Supreme, a type of psychedelic state he was known to spontaneously slip in and out of at

217
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,660
all times of the day.

218
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:38,860
I noticed as you were meditating, there was rapid eye movement on your part.

219
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:45,860
My consciousness was flying from one plane of reality to another.

220
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:51,300
This facial expression Chenmue adopted became the focal point of his group meditations,

221
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:55,540
with students staring into the flickering whites of his eyes as they cleared their minds

222
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,540
of thought.

223
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:03,380
Treat Chenmue as like a visitor from this other world to this world to show his followers

224
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,500
how to reach this other world.

225
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:11,700
At home, students would substitute with a photograph, as instructed by his 1978 meditation

226
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,700
manual.

227
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:17,620
Quote, the best type of meditation comes when you enter into my consciousness by looking

228
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:22,820
at a picture taken of me when I am in a high meditative consciousness, when I am one with

229
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,220
the Supreme.

230
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:47,980
Do not think of it as a picture of a human being.

231
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:52,580
Chenmue would soon have enough of a following to pack out event rooms, where he would take

232
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:58,740
the stage, establish a oneness with the Supreme, and then deliver, to a crowd of thousands,

233
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:15,740
a new creative miracle.

234
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:21,340
In a single performance, Chenmue would sometimes cycle through a hundred or more instruments,

235
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:26,620
improvising melodies with each one just long enough to channel the Supreme, before moving

236
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:40,380
on to the next.

237
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:47,140
By the late 1970s, Chenmue's multi-sensory meditation experience had extended far beyond

238
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,140
Queens, New York.

239
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:53,020
There are over 125 Sri Chim Noi centers around the world.

240
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,020
What goes on in them?

241
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,500
What happens in the centers?

242
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:01,620
My students all over the world, wherever there are centers, they play and meditate, and they

243
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:27,180
read my writings, and also, as you know, I have composed thousands of songs.

244
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:31,780
Much of Chenmue's success was owed to the recruitment efforts of his students, and old

245
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:36,580
newspaper classified show that Frederick Len spent much of his early career as a traveling

246
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:52,900
meditation instructor, leading workshops on behalf of the Sri Chenmue centers.

247
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:58,260
He went by Atmananda, one of the Sanskrit nicknames that Chenmue had given to all of

248
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,940
those in his inner circle.

249
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:04,620
I decided to study with Sri Chenmue through Atmananda.

250
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:08,660
He was the number one disciple-bringer for Chenmue around the world.

251
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,660
He was very good at it.

252
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,660
He was a brilliant speaker.

253
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:13,660
Oh yeah, there's a definite battle between the light and the dark.

254
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,860
The network always wins, though.

255
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,860
We run the galaxy.

256
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:23,220
What was he a professor of, and where was he professing?

257
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:29,460
He was a professor of American literature at State University of New York at Stonybrook.

258
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:35,340
So I can only suggest that you learn to be what my friend Theodor Rutke called a perpetual

259
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:41,980
beginner, because if you feel that you're knowledgeable, you may be.

260
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,660
But to be a perpetual beginner is the happy part.

261
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,020
Being a student is much more fun than being a teacher.

262
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:54,540
Len's experience as a professor gave him a natural ease and authority over his college-aged

263
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,060
audience members.

264
00:19:56,060 --> 00:20:01,780
And as he traveled the country gathering recruits, he began to realize an opportunity.

265
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:06,340
He would give a lecture for Chenmue to recruit people into Chenmue's circles.

266
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:11,700
At the very end, he'd be up there sitting cross-legged on the table, and he was channeling

267
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:15,460
the guru's spiritual light.

268
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:21,060
And he would look at people, and spiritual light would come out of his eyes, he would

269
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,060
say.

270
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:26,860
Well, that's a big no-no, because that is up for the big kahuna to do, not for the little

271
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:29,260
tiny atmananda to do.

272
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:35,740
And by 1980, Len's workshops were no longer associated with the Shri Chenmue centers,

273
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,520
but sponsored by his own organization.

274
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:44,440
He took off with a handful of other Shri Chenmue followers, convincing them that he was the

275
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,500
one and the master has kind of fallen.

276
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,720
As I grew up spiritually, as I entered into enlightenment, I saw the limitations of my

277
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,460
own teacher who was a very powerful occultist, but who I thought was, to some extent, limiting

278
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,480
others in their spiritual growth.

279
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,000
Come with me, I'm the new enlightened one.

280
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,400
It wouldn't be easy for Len's to rise out of Shri Chenmue's shadow.

281
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,600
Not only did Chenmue have the adoration of thousands, he'd been hosting weekly meditations

282
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,160
at the United Nations headquarters.

283
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,560
Every Tuesday, his students could watch him slip into the supreme in front of some of the

284
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,400
most influential people in the world.

285
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:26,180
In order to take followers away from Chenmue, Len's would need to establish himself as

286
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:29,120
a guru of greater merit.

287
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,600
What did Frederick Len say he was offering his students?

288
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:37,160
So he was offering his students spiritual energy.

289
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:42,640
At a certain point, I came to learn that we had studied with him specifically for hundreds

290
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:49,880
or thousands of lifetimes, and we've all grown towards enlightenment because of working

291
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,880
with him.

292
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,920
And so what he was offering his students was spiritual energy.

293
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:00,160
When I sit with my students and meditate with them, I channel the Kundalini, the energy,

294
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,160
directly into them.

295
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,960
I bring them through plane after plane of consciousness.

296
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,840
What they would do in a hundred years of meditation, I can do in an hour with them.

297
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,920
This was the spiel.

298
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,420
He'd give us spiritual energy.

299
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:15,360
We would go home with that spiritual energy and meditate better.

300
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,760
And I take the Kundalini and I play against the notes with it.

301
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,920
I kind of do a light show inwardly and outwardly.

302
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,920
With the energy, with vortexes of energy, as you sit there, opening you up, opening up

303
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:29,160
different parts of you that maybe you haven't felt since you were a child, it's no big deal.

304
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,720
It's just what I do.

305
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:35,360
And when Lenz announced his separation from Chenmoy, it's reported that he was able

306
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:40,420
to siphon about 40% of the students in attendance.

307
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:46,320
But even without his star recruiter, Chenmoy's following only increased throughout the 1980s,

308
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,640
and his students were beginning to perform creative miracles of their own.

309
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:57,600
In 1986, the world record for most consecutive underwater pogo stick jumps was surpassed.

310
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:03,360
The new champion used his platform as an opportunity to promote the three Chenmoy centers.

311
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,880
Elsewhere in New York, a student shattered the record for continuous hand clapping with

312
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,040
50 hours of non-stop applause.

313
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:15,040
And he did so, he said, to honor his guru.

314
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:22,440
By 1982, Chenmoy claimed to have completed over 140,000 paintings, as well as over 4,000

315
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:31,240
musical compositions.

316
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,080
Lenz would need his own way of showing the fruits of his enlightenment.

317
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:40,520
Now, I have written a number of pieces of music to meditate to.

318
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:44,520
I asked the Zen master, what is dancing?

319
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,520
Dancing.

320
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,520
Dancing.

321
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,520
Dancing.

322
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:56,600
Lenz was Lenz's rock, new age band.

323
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,800
And he was credited as writing all the songs.

324
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,200
And I would listen to them all the time.

325
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,400
All the time.

326
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,200
I mean all the time.

327
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,600
It is moving to the right.

328
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,960
Lenz was joined by three of his students to form Zazen.

329
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:16,600
And throughout the 1980s, they produced a number of albums with tracks like

330
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,800
Death is Sexual and Gandalf the Wizard.

331
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,280
I loved listening to it, but I was, you know, controlled to love listening to it.

332
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,640
It was actually fine music.

333
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,680
It was perfectly good.

334
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,160
This music is composed in other dimensions.

335
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,760
That's where I go to compose it.

336
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,800
And then it's brought here into this world from the planes of light.

337
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,880
And it's played by some of my students.

338
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,600
Chenmoy had become well-known for drawing talented musicians into his orbit.

339
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:45,960
Guitarist Carlos Santana and John McLaughlin both spent much of their early careers making

340
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,440
music dedicated to the Supreme.

341
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:54,040
Zazen was stacked with talent as well, with Grammy-nominated Joaquin Lievenow providing

342
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,160
lead guitar.

343
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,840
And Lenz would incorporate this music into his live workshops,

344
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,520
often using it as a focal point for group meditations.

345
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,240
And I go through the music that they've played with my aura.

346
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,840
We'll wash out anything impure.

347
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,680
So there's only light in the music.

348
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,120
It's perfect music.

349
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,880
Students were asked to demonstrate their spiritual growth as well.

350
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:19,640
Lenz required the submission of essays, detailing each student's progress in their twice daily

351
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:25,960
meditations and several supplementary disciplines such as the reading and re-reading of recommended

352
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,960
books and martial arts taught by Sensei Lenz himself.

353
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,920
Martial arts is an ancient science.

354
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,400
It was codified by Buddhist monks.

355
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:40,440
He would wear a gi, you know, the karate white gi with a black belt.

356
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,000
And they both looked like they had just come out of the package.

357
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,240
They still had the folds all over them and stuff like that.

358
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,080
I will be extending an invisible energy field that we call the key

359
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,880
that we gain from deep meditation and samadhi.

360
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,240
This has rarely been seen outside of the Orient.

361
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,480
There's nothing she can do.

362
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,600
Is there anything you can do?

363
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,400
His inner circle would run at him and he'd go,

364
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,880
huh, like that with his hands and then they'd fall down.

365
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,920
What I want to do is interfere with their minds.

366
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,480
The mind is the ultimate weapon.

367
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,160
So they're going to come at me and I'm just going to project a wave of energy out of my body

368
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,040
to disable them.

369
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:20,680
Right?

370
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:20,920
Good.

371
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,080
Okay.

372
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:21,960
Come at me.

373
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,520
Come.

374
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:22,840
Say.

375
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,600
One more time.

376
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,480
Come at me.

377
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,040
Come.

378
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:28,520
Say.

379
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,640
For a moment, a wave of energy sweeps through their body

380
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,000
and they don't know where they are.

381
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
What world they're in, what dimension they're in.

382
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,680
It's embarrassing.

383
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,880
It's cringy.

384
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,200
Right?

385
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,320
How bad it was.

386
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,040
But man, did it look good when I was under mind control.

387
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:46,760
Holy shit.

388
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,640
That guy could move.

389
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,560
Len seemed to take the strictness of routine from Chen Moy

390
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:55,800
who frequently enrolled his students in marathons to advertise the center

391
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:00,680
and was known for waking his students up at 3 a.m. for morning meditations.

392
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:04,920
But Len's took what he called a Western-oriented approach to enlightenment.

393
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:09,400
If students weren't progressing in their careers and increasing their salaries,

394
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,360
they weren't making full use of his spiritual energy.

395
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:23,000
In this modern world, the more money you make,

396
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,880
it's the better meditation you're having.

397
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:30,920
It's difficult to find a consistent membership price for Len's meditation group.

398
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:36,920
The introductory seminars are usually advertised as either free or for a small cover charge.

399
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,920
But as attendees became regulars,

400
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:44,760
tuition could range anywhere from $600 a month to $2,500 a month.

401
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,360
I believe it was $20 a month.

402
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:46,840
Really?

403
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,400
Yeah.

404
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,600
Is that what you pay?

405
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,240
No.

406
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,640
Since then, my career has advanced significantly

407
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,960
and I pay approximately $1,000 a month now.

408
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:58,360
For me, it started free and then it was like a sliding scale.

409
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:03,880
Like if you could pay $100 a month, $500 a month, that would be helpful.

410
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:08,760
And it got to the point where I might have been paying $3 or $500 a month scrambling.

411
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:13,960
To cover the ever-increasing tuition, students were encouraged to switch careers.

412
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:19,320
And at Len's's suggestion, many of them turned to the fledgling field of computer programming.

413
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:23,720
A person who meditates who becomes a programmer is kind of like a duck in a happy pond.

414
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:28,120
You're in the right situation for many, many reasons.

415
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:34,920
He believed or he taught that computer programming was very similar to really good meditation

416
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,760
because of where your brain goes.

417
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:42,280
Computers are fascinating because the mindset necessary to work with advanced structures

418
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:47,000
in programming and in design is exactly what we do in advanced meditation.

419
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,760
It's exactly the same mindset.

420
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:55,720
I had credit cards at age 20, 21 that I was maxing out because of the promise of,

421
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,280
just in a few months, you're going to be making $100,000 a year,

422
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,000
which was an unbelievable amount of money back then.

423
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,480
According to ex-followers, Len's told his students that they'd all been software

424
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:10,280
developers together in past lives in the lost city of Atlantis.

425
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,960
And he appears to have registered a corporation under the title

426
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:18,920
High Priest of the First Diocese of the Californian Church of Atlantis.

427
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,880
The computers in Atlantis were infinitely evolved.

428
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,400
All processing was done with light. Electricity's much too slow.

429
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:30,600
But if his students had known how to code thousands of years ago, they would need a refresher.

430
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,520
If you're not familiar with the world of programming, you might take a simple course in it,

431
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,200
and then there are two ways to plunge into it.

432
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,440
One is to go to a short-term computer school where you go for six months or nine months or a year,

433
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,760
either during the day full-time or in the evening.

434
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,440
He talked a lot about the importance of programming computers and artificial

435
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,480
intelligence and relational databases, which is like a three- or four-D

436
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,880
database instead of like a flat spreadsheet, right?

437
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,840
I'm a nerd, so I kind of understood it, and there were lots of people who were like,

438
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,040
I don't know what he's saying, but they like worked really hard to figure it out.

439
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,920
Was Len's knowledgeable about computer programming?

440
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,480
As far as I know, he was like a Steve Jobs.

441
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:10,040
He understood the root of mentoring stuff, but he was just trying to inspire people

442
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,680
to go out and make a great deal of money.

443
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,840
Obviously, it's a smart career choice.

444
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:19,480
It's our country's number one business now, and it will only become more so.

445
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:24,440
But not every student waited until they knew how to code before entering the field.

446
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:29,800
A pattern began to form of students packing out their resumes with proficiencies and programming

447
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:34,760
languages, enlisting one another as previous employers who would vouch for them.

448
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:38,440
If you don't have experience, come up with the names of some companies.

449
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:42,520
Then you have somebody say, yes, they worked for me there, a friend.

450
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:46,200
Most of them didn't know anything about coding, and they would use each other

451
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:52,280
as references onto their resume and list all of the computer programming jobs they've had,

452
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,240
which they never did.

453
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,640
With the intention that they were going to do the best job they had,

454
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:59,160
and they had this enlightened being's energy, so they should be able to persevere.

455
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:03,160
So what normally would take four or eight hours at their work, they would work

456
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:08,440
12, 14, 16 hours looking at books, copying code, doing all of this stuff that they could

457
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,480
until they actually started understanding it usually.

458
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,840
The girl that I worked with at City Corp, who was doing this, was on the phone all the time

459
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,600
with her, with the other people in the cult, and she would use me as a source of information.

460
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,680
She would ask me questions that were totally unrelated to her specific job.

461
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,480
They were obviously, she was trying to help these other people.

462
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,960
So basically, it would be the blind leading the blind.

463
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:32,920
Sometimes they'd get caught, put on a literal blacklist because they were destroying code.

464
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:38,120
As one newsletter that circulated among the industry's hiring managers stated,

465
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:43,160
lenses followers were, quote, inserting themselves virus-like on accounts in the

466
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,440
tri-state area where they proceeded to wreak havoc.

467
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,080
But not all who lied their way into these companies were exposed.

468
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:55,720
Many learned the software languages quickly enough to begin rising the ranks into high

469
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:01,720
income positions, and they were advised to use this money to reinvest in their enlightenment.

470
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,920
You get more money, which tells you how more enlightened you are.

471
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:11,240
And since we're simple monks, we give this money back to him as a gesture of thank you.

472
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:17,160
And then he takes the money as the gesture, and then he gives us more spiritual energy,

473
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:21,960
which lets us meditate better, to program code better, and then give him more money.

474
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,760
To study enlightenment requires a commitment.

475
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:28,040
And part of that commitment is a person's willingness to go out and work to make the

476
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,880
money to pay for their own way.

477
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:34,760
How much money do you think you spent involved with Zen Master Rama?

478
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:39,720
In cash layouts, for the five-month involvement from January to May 1985,

479
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,920
I gave out a little over $30,000 in cash.

480
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,520
And an exceptional person, of course, will pay even more, will give even more,

481
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,160
because they not only want to just pay for their own way,

482
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:53,000
but they wish to make enlightenment more available to others.

483
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,760
Because you were a spiritual student of his, and you'd come to him and go,

484
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:00,760
I have this great idea for a computer program or, you know, a database program.

485
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:06,680
He would become CEO of every single one, like dozens of these companies.

486
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,680
Lenz credited himself with developing software through the 1980s and 90s that he claimed was

487
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:19,160
used by hundreds of American companies, both commercial and military.

488
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,880
And it's reported that some of his more successful programmers were providing

489
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,400
Lenz with upwards of $5,000 per month each.

490
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:31,880
If I were to keep on going and had a full-time job out of college,

491
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:38,040
I would have been paying as much as I could, $1,000 a month, which was a lot, $2,000 a month,

492
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:45,640
and living with a number of other Lenz followers by sleeping on floors or packing into rooms.

493
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:50,600
So we didn't have much overhead in eating ramen or just vegetables or whatever,

494
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,280
and then giving him essentially all of our money.

495
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:59,800
Did he ever, in any of his seminars, you know, verbally justify how he could ask that much?

496
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:05,320
Lenz would say that at his level, and the amount of energy he had,

497
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:11,240
there are so many people who want him dead, maybe from the government or these unknown

498
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:14,280
evil people, or they just wanted to steal his energy.

499
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:20,680
He needs to hide himself out and in planes fight protecting himself in impeccable locations

500
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:26,040
that sat on like vortexes or energy centers that the earth naturally gives,

501
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:31,000
and also surround himself with other high-class things that energetically

502
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,040
contain his energy and protect him from this dangerous world.

503
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:41,800
By 1988, Lenz was purchasing million-dollar homes across the United States

504
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,600
in order to bring enlightenment to a wider audience.

505
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:49,960
I can work anywhere I want in the world. I can do what I want to,

506
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:56,040
when I want to, buy or not buy what I want to, and I have a good understanding of art,

507
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:01,320
literature, mathematics, geography, computer science, and the world.

508
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:07,320
I know a lot about people. I'm not a bigot, and I try and help people out whenever I can,

509
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,440
but I'm also street smart. I know the street real well.

510
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:18,680
By the end of the 1980s, Lenz had begun to elicit a fair amount of attention from journalists.

511
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:22,120
LA Weekly published a several thousand-word expose,

512
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:28,600
making it the centerpiece of the January 28th, 1988 issue with this illustration as the cover.

513
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:34,040
There's a newspaper in Los Angeles called the LA Weekly that ran a story called Busting Rama.

514
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,960
I didn't know that there was anything to but. I mean, I don't understand what the problem is.

515
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,240
I teach seminars. They're very mainstream. I do them at Lincoln Center and every

516
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:45,640
talk about me. The authors interviewed several ex-followers for the expose,

517
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:50,760
marking one of the first times Lenz was publicly confronted with the more extraordinary claims

518
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:55,160
he had convinced his students to believe. I want to see if some, any things are correct.

519
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:59,800
Followers say that you make rooms glow with golden light. You can make the moon change colors,

520
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:05,000
the star spin, the wind stop. We should all be so lucky. Sounds like they're talking about Jesus

521
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,400
Christ here today. It does to me. Are you denied having ever climbed any of this? Of course not.

522
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,000
If you meet an enlightened person, you will see, if you have the ability to see on a subtle

523
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,160
physical level, a beautiful golden light around them. Oh, you may see many other things.

524
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:21,960
You claim to be one of the 12 fully enlightened beings on this planet? No, of course not.

525
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:27,560
In my estimation, at this time, there are 12 fully enlightened teachers in this world of which I am one.

526
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:32,920
Lenz claimed to be one of the 12 enlightened beings on earth. Do you know what he meant by that?

527
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:39,480
Yeah, people who have evolved for like, come, uh, incarnated for thousands of incarnations

528
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,600
who have studied Buddhism at a certain point, you get to a point like a,

529
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:48,520
like a Buddhist or a Jesus state, right? Where you're so enlightened and connected to the universe

530
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:55,800
that you're at the top. Are you one of the 12 enlightened beings on earth? I am an enlightened

531
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:00,840
teacher and it would take about an hour to explain what that means. Who are the other 11?

532
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:06,440
Well, there's a very well-known gentleman in India called Satya Sai Baba and so on and so

533
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:11,880
forth, names you wouldn't even know. It was almost a threat if you think about it. If it's not him,

534
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:16,760
there's a good chance you're not going to find the other ones. You really lucked out or you were

535
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:23,560
meant to find him. Other claims include Lenz telling his followers that he could stop breathing while

536
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:27,400
in deep meditation. When you go into Samadhi, very often you won't breathe for half an hour,

537
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:33,320
an hour. There's no breath at all. And something called blisses, this line of puppets that Lenz

538
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:40,920
had imbued with spiritual energy. What does this have to do with Zen master Rama? Anyone want to

539
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:46,120
just jump in here? It's fun. I can guess it's called a bliss and you've got them in your

540
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:51,720
apartment and part of the things they do is get rid of demons. Question. Hold on, hold on.

541
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:57,160
But the most alarming revelation in the busting Rama expose was what Lenz did to many of the

542
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:02,280
women in the group. We're not really having sex at all. It's an exchange of energy.

543
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:08,520
As a young man in Lenz's circle, did he treat you any differently from the women in the group?

544
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:15,240
I wasn't aware of it at the time, but the answer is yes. So what was happening behind the scenes

545
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:24,920
was that he would pick out some woman or young woman and convince them that if they had sex with

546
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:31,960
him, it's actually like a tantric way of him viewing them with spiritual energy. The greatest

547
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:37,800
transfer, karmic transfer, occurs in aside from meditating with someone, in sex with someone.

548
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:43,480
He said that he had sex with many of his women students. It was strictly a spiritual exercise

549
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:51,960
designed to energize me and raise my awareness level up to a higher realm. I actually heard that

550
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:58,200
some of his inner circle were convincing new people to do the same thing because they were higher

551
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:06,120
than everybody else. I talked to one guy after the fact after we were both out and his girlfriend was

552
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:10,680
one of those people and they broke up because of it and he left the group not because he didn't

553
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:17,080
believe that he was unenlightened and he was a fraud. He actually left because this feels

554
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:23,800
unequal because there's no option for him to have sex or some equivalent with this guy.

555
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:29,560
Throughout the 1980s, much of Lenz's advertising campaign appeared to be aimed exclusively toward

556
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:35,800
women. He has somewhat of a radical, very pro-women liberation point of view. It's days for him to

557
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:41,640
tell us as women how we can attain greater enlightenment. Good morning, welcome to our show.

558
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:47,000
From a point of view of meditation, let's say that women have an inner power that men don't. We

559
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,440
know that women's bodies are stronger than men. They can endure greater temperature changes,

560
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:57,400
heat, cold. There are physiological differences, but from a psychic point of view, women just have

561
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:04,200
a stronger energy. They can bear more and endure more. By the end of the decade, Lenz had accumulated

562
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:10,440
over a thousand followers with a high tuition inner circle of nearly 400 dedicated members.

563
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:16,920
The group had spread over the country with meditation bases in Palo Alto, Malibu, New York,

564
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:23,480
and Boston. You originally started in New York. You moved to San Diego. You had you

565
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:27,800
asked people to follow you from New York to San Diego. You asked some of those people to follow

566
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:32,520
you from San Diego to Malibu. Now, I had a meditation center in San Diego, Los Angeles,

567
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:38,040
and San Francisco. That's true. I've never asked anyone to move anywhere. Did Lenz ever ask his

568
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:44,600
followers to move or relocate with him? Yes. There would be rumblings for a few weeks or a

569
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:50,200
month or two like the Exodus is coming up. My first Exodus was when we went from Boston to

570
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:56,360
Los Angeles or to Chicago. I can't remember the places. You would leave all your friends and

571
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:02,440
family and everyone you ever knew like they were old clothes that don't fit anymore. When you show

572
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:07,160
up to this new place, you're finally free of the past. You get to reinvent yourself.

573
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:14,120
Instead of talking to your family members, you can give them their beeper number. So,

574
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:20,920
you're like connected, but you never respond to the beeper number. I was preparing for mine

575
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:26,600
and saving money by living in my parents' house while I was working full-time to disappear to New

576
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:33,720
York and just disappear, not even say goodbye. Gone. There are certain places. We call them places

577
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:39,880
of power on the earth. These are fabulous places. These are places where there's more energy available.

578
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:46,360
For some reason, when you meditate in these places, it's easier to stop your thoughts. There was a

579
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:51,800
time limit hidden from the concerned family and friends who might be considering an intervention.

580
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:57,480
If they didn't act quickly, they might lose the opportunity for good. But without an understanding

581
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:02,440
of what these students were experiencing, many interventions went nowhere. He asked,

582
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:09,480
so, Mark, are you getting involved in a cult? And I said, no, Rabbi, I'm studying spiritual

583
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:18,440
mysticism. And he sort of looked at me and he said, well, Judaism is a set of laws and we don't

584
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:25,880
deal with that stuff. What the students of Frederick Lenz really needed was expert intervention.

585
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:30,040
Would you mind introducing yourself and giving it a description of what it is that you do?

586
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:37,560
Yeah, hello. My name is Joe Simhart. I'm known as a cult information specialist. Since 1980,

587
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:43,880
I've helped people, families, the media understand the cult problem. I've done interventions that

588
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:50,680
were called the programings or exit counselings, approximately 500 or more. I also have a career

589
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:56,600
in the fight arts. Joe Simhart was a recurring voice of opposition throughout Frederick Lenz's

590
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:02,280
career. In the late 80s, he publicly confronted Lenz on the talk show A Current Affair.

591
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:07,880
What does he do that creates such loyalty? Well, for one thing, he sets himself up as

592
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:13,400
something that he is not. A Zen master, an enlightened being, a person who can traverse

593
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:19,960
in the occult world at will. I do two night a month seminars that a person attends and may or

594
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:24,920
may not attend again. I don't see how this race is occult. Joe's interest in this field came

595
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:30,520
organically. Throughout the 1970s, he'd been a member of the Apocalyptic Church Universal and

596
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:37,240
Triumphant, led by the charismatic Guru Ma, who claimed to be, quote, God incarnate.

597
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:43,000
In unraveling that whole thing and deconstructing what I had been involved in, I became kind of an

598
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:49,400
expert in the field of fundamentalist Christianity, New Age cult, Strait Buddhism, self-help groups,

599
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:54,760
all kinds of things that are related to this sort of activity. The programmers and exit counselors

600
00:43:54,760 --> 00:44:00,760
got to know about me and asked me to go on cases with them. So I got, I guess, good at it at doing

601
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:05,240
conflict resolution with families that were impacted by this. And quite a few people would

602
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:09,480
leave these cults after talking to me, sometimes for several hours, sometimes for a week.

603
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,800
When did Frederick Lenz first appear on your radar?

604
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:20,760
In 1986, a family called me from California complaining that their daughter had just got

605
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:26,280
home and she was a mess and had been living with Frederick Lenz Rama for three months at his place

606
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:33,400
in Long Island. They flew me out and I spent a week with their daughter and she filled me in on

607
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:38,920
Lenz's behavior. He had her take LSD and she said during the first trip she ever did on LSD,

608
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:44,680
he began to scream and yell at her for failing him, for not being respecting him as an enlightened

609
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:50,680
person and she was devastated and suicidal, he left her alone in the house. Sadie's used as a

610
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:55,640
woman, you know her? Sure do. She says she was seduced by you, you made her a mistress, she says

611
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:59,640
you encouraged her to use LSD, try to make her believe she was possessed by demons, told her she

612
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:04,920
was the only one who could save her from the dark. She called a friend that came to pick her up and

613
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:11,560
called her family and they got her on a plane and sent her home and so I helped her to deconstruct

614
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:17,720
or debrief her about what happened to her, you know, what cults are about, what narcissistic

615
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:22,520
leaders are about, the fact that Lenz didn't appear to be enlightened and his claim to be in

616
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:27,880
light was just a claim to be entitled. Well she ran away, that's true, that's bad, this is someone

617
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:32,440
I spent some time with, a young woman, a very beautiful young woman who I went out with and

618
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:36,840
we traveled together for a while and had a great time together, she seemed to have an obsession

619
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:42,920
as some people do with demons, it was unfortunate, I liked her very very much, I thought she was just

620
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:48,440
super. That started my career with him, one of his mistresses and subsequently I had Exit Council

621
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:54,600
of about five other mistresses of his and about 20 other members. What were the greatest challenges

622
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:59,560
in deprogramming a devoted follower of Lenz? Yeah so the difficulty is just getting the whole

623
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:04,440
conversation started and once a person realizes that it's all about their choice, you know,

624
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:10,200
they can stay in the group forever if they wish to for every reincarnation or they could even

625
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:15,160
talk it out and see what I had to say or what the ex-member I had with me had to say, you know,

626
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:19,880
over time in most of those cases on the third day the person was ready to defect from the group.

627
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:24,280
Joe was often joined in these interventions by former students of Lenz,

628
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:29,720
many of whom Joe had Exit Counciled himself and when they weren't assisting in deprogrammings,

629
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:35,160
these ex-followers could be found protesting outside of Lenz's seminars. Could you describe

630
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:39,640
some of the common characteristics of a Rama student? Most of them were quite attractive,

631
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:44,600
young, intelligent, they could have been successful in business, you know, higher than

632
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:49,720
average IQ, lower than average IQ about comparative religions and another understanding

633
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:55,800
what Buddhism was really about so he could fool them as far as that aspect of spirituality and

634
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:03,320
you know, hungry for either spiritual enlightenment or success. The unenlightened can only take you

635
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:08,120
to the beach because they can't bring you across the ocean. God can do that directly if that's the

636
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:13,640
will of eternity or God will do that through the voice and the guidance of what we call an enlightened

637
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:19,240
person. It's this exchange between the narcissist and the hero-hungry person. The narcissist becomes

638
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:25,560
a foil like a movie that they can watch and feel part of and they join that guru on this stage.

639
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:31,160
You get kind of caught up in it, it becomes a self-ceiling social system and anything that's

640
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:36,120
critical of that self-ceiling social system is considered ignorant or evil or some other

641
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:40,040
thought-terminating cliche that prevents the person from thinking about the criticism.

642
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:45,640
During television appearances, Joe was often captioned as being affiliated with an organization

643
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:50,200
called the Colt Awareness Network. You know, this guy's not the head of the Colt Awareness Network.

644
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:55,800
Our eyes is a programmer who's hired to do kidnappings for $50,000 a hit. Can, as it would be

645
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:03,080
called, formed following the Jonestown massacre of 1978 when spiritual leader Jim Jones coerced over

646
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:08,680
900 followers to ingest cyanide in what he called a revolutionary suicide.

647
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:13,800
We cannot afford to forget what happened in Jonestown, said Cann's initial director.

648
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:20,120
They had annual conferences. The basic function was to disseminate information about controversial

649
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:25,000
groups. There was a time if you were worried about your son or daughter being an occult,

650
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:30,360
you could get help from a small non-profit organization called the Colt Awareness Network,

651
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:35,720
one follower of Lenz described the Colt Awareness Network as, quote,

652
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:42,680
utterly vicious people who prey on others religious freedom. Lenz himself told Newsday that, quote,

653
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:46,760
Cann is to small religious groups what the KKK is to black people.

654
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:51,720
If anything is a cult, it's the Colt Awareness Network, and I will tell you that. That is a cult.

655
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:57,800
I think Lenz is an individual who craves power. I think Lenz is an individual who has found how

656
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:03,880
to manipulate people to satisfy his craving for power. There's an organization that calls itself

657
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:10,040
the Colt Awareness Network, and they put families in touch with kidnappers who go out and grab these

658
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:17,640
people, sometimes 25 to 50 grand a shot is paid by wealthy parents. There were only two cases that

659
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:25,160
I can recall regarding Lenz, two young ladies that began coercively where the family had kidnapped

660
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:31,960
them and flew me in after securing them to try to talk them to leave Lenz. And both of those

661
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:38,520
cases didn't work, unfortunately, but all the voluntary cases I did with his followers did work.

662
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:45,880
One of those women was Jennifer Jacobs. Yes. I had me locked in this hotel for 11 days until

663
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:51,640
I ring out my police system. Okay, I am 22 years old. I'm a legal adult. They have no right. They

664
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:59,800
can be concerned all the while, but they have no man right to kidnap me. In the September 18, 1992

665
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:05,800
issue of the Philadelphia Enquirer, a woman named Jennifer Jacobs published a letter to the editor

666
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:10,680
in response to an exposé the Enquirer had published the previous week called,

667
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:17,320
As Guru's Disciples Hit Town Critics Cry Beware, the author of the exposé interviewed Jennifer's

668
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:22,040
parents and they were quoted saying that since joining Lenz's meditation group,

669
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:27,480
their daughter had stopped speaking to them and quote, no longer has a sense of humor and has

670
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:33,640
stopped playing the piano, a passion she had since childhood. Jennifer had written to tell her side

671
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:41,720
of the story, quote, in 1987, my parents paid $25,000 to have me brutally kidnapped, locked in

672
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:48,440
captivity, terrorized and abused for 11 days in a filthy motel in what was euphemistically called

673
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:55,480
an involuntary deprogramming, end quote. She used similar language in our affidavit, naming her

674
00:50:55,480 --> 00:51:02,520
parents as complicit in the kidnapping and Joe as among the two deprogrammers. I read the affidavit

675
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:09,320
she accused can of kidnapping her and holding her against her will in a hotel room for 11 days

676
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:15,480
in an effort to deprogram her. Is there truth to that? Well, can of the call to awareness network

677
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:19,720
had nothing to do with it. Number one, they didn't hire the programmers and they didn't

678
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:25,400
manage them even though people that did interventions attended can conferences and would do some

679
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:32,360
networking but can didn't approve of kidnapping programming. So that was wrong. I'm trying to

680
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:36,680
think of a, I don't remember if it went 11 days, I think it probably went like a week.

681
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:43,960
She went to a rehab center afterwards, you know, agreeing to go and which was for ex-called members

682
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:49,800
and she escaped from there or left it because you could, it was voluntary and she went back

683
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:54,280
to the group and after that we heard all this negative stuff about the experience.

684
00:51:54,920 --> 00:52:00,920
That is a potent self-righteous man and that is the attitude of the whole call to awareness network.

685
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:05,960
She was quite angry, her family ended me. I've since met with her after she broke away from

686
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:12,920
lens and we've reconciled all of that. In 1992, Joe was quoted saying, I don't recommend coercive

687
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:16,920
situations anymore because there's too much trauma involved for everyone.

688
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:32,440
Hello power lovers. I'm here today on top of the continental divide.

689
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:40,280
11,500 feet up above the earth. I'm parked by the side of the road. It's around 745

690
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:46,200
in the evening on August 7th. Occasionally a car or truck will roar by.

691
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:57,960
I'm facing some distant power mountains, a suitable place to discuss with you the end of the world.

692
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:05,000
By the 1990s, Frederick Lenz's career had entered a precarious phase. On the surface,

693
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,640
things seemed to be trending in his favor. He published his first novel titled,

694
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:14,840
Surfing the Himalayas, the story of a young spiritual aspirant and a zen master named

695
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:19,960
Flop who set out to snowboard their way to enlightenment. Now, your book is about a lot

696
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:24,520
more than snowboarding. I mean, in this case, the perfect ride is really about spiritual

697
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:29,400
enlightenment, isn't it? Well, snowboarding is spiritual enlightenment. Snowboarding is the

698
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:33,640
fastest growing sport in the world and in five years there are going to be more people on snowboards

699
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:38,920
than on skis. But yes, you're absolutely right. Snowboarding is about balance. The novel sold

700
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:45,320
90,000 copies. It was even publicly endorsed by Chicago Bull's head coach, Phil Jackson,

701
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:49,880
who quickly whiffed through the blurb after backlash from the Chicago Tribune.

702
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:56,520
The sequel, Snowboarding to Nirvana, also sold well. Enrolling stone after reading the latest

703
00:53:56,520 --> 00:54:01,960
coverage of Pearl Jam's battle with Ticketmaster and flipping past all the ads for CD subscription

704
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:07,880
services, readers would find Lenz's face with two full-printed pages dedicated to

705
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:13,080
promoting the new Zazen album. There's also what must have seemed a reassuring amount of

706
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:18,840
web-hosted fan pages that appeared around this time, but Lenz's reputation at large

707
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:26,040
only continued to plummet. In 1993, ex-follower Mark Laxer released a memoir called Take Me for

708
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:31,720
a Ride. The book details how Lenz convinced his students that Sri Chenmoy couldn't actually

709
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:37,240
achieve Samadhi, the deepest state of meditation in which union with the Supreme is reached,

710
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:42,120
and had only been faking it for clout. And how Mark and other male students were

711
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:47,640
dissuaded from even speaking to the women in the group for fear of bringing down their energy

712
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:53,720
while Lenz himself was privately pursuing them. Laxer's impetus for leaving the group was the

713
00:54:53,720 --> 00:55:00,120
passing of a student named Donald Cole, who'd named Lenz in the note he left behind. Cole had

714
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:06,920
been among the 400th students purged by Lenz for, quote, maintaining an abysmal level of consciousness.

715
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:11,800
There were times where he, irrationally, I mean, these were people, three or five hundred people,

716
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:16,280
who'd be giving him tens of thousands of dollars, like constantly, and he would just get rid of half

717
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:20,600
of everyone. He would just, like, wipe everybody out. Sometimes a spiritual teacher will literally

718
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:25,080
kick out some of their best students because it's time for them to go out and experience for a while

719
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:29,720
in the world. Sometimes a student just isn't doing well. They're knocking their head against the wall.

720
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:33,000
Well, if you're a good teacher, you don't let them keep knocking their head against the wall.

721
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,880
They hurt themselves. You send them out for a while. People would be sobbing. Lenz was

722
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:42,920
simultaneously threatening to use his spiritual energy against students who left the group of

723
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:50,360
their own accord. It is possible that he could give me cancer or, as I'm driving late at night,

724
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:57,400
alone. My card is my flip. Do you know how Lenz would dissuade his followers from leaving his group?

725
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:02,440
Well, there was a lot of dark forces out there, according to him, and that without his protection,

726
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:07,640
you will fall into insanity. Your life will collapse. You won't have a chance for enlightenment for

727
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:13,800
many lifetimes. Now that you're sort of connected with his energy spiritually, if you were to leave

728
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:20,120
your body is so kind of addicted or connected that you would quickly fall into the lower levels,

729
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:26,120
kind of the hell levels of existence, in which case you'd go crazy. You'd get cancer. You'd get

730
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:31,640
into a car accident. About three years out of the group, I still believe he could do that. He could

731
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:38,440
stop my heart. He could cause a car accident. But the 1990s saw Lenz's opposition ramping up as well.

732
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:43,320
X students managed to get his novels dropped from Barnes & Noble promotional events,

733
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:48,520
and reports surfaced of a group of parents called LenzWatch, who worked synergistically with the

734
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:53,800
Cult Awareness Network in order to find students and connect them with exit counselors. For more

735
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:58,600
information about Lenz and his followers, you can contact the Cult Awareness Network or a group

736
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:04,360
called LenzWatch. I had told my mother, whatever you do, if the Cult Awareness Network gives you

737
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:08,760
a call and tries to convince you that I'm in a cult, just hang up on them. They're going to try

738
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:13,400
to deprogram me and try to get tons of money out of you. And then I walked away and she said,

739
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:19,320
the Cult Awareness Network, that sounds legit. So she called them and it turns out one of the top

740
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:26,120
cult interventionists or exit counselors lived just three towns away or five times away. And

741
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:29,720
I still thought that they were going to be full of shit, but I was like, I might as well listen

742
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:34,600
to what they have to say. My friends are there, my family is there, this guy who's the cult expert,

743
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:41,560
and a few ex-members are all there. And they show me videotapes of Scientology, the boonies,

744
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:47,800
and stuff like that. And I want to say three or four hours into just talking and learning about

745
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:55,720
mind control and other cults. I had the sensation of popping out of it. It was like, pop. And I

746
00:57:55,720 --> 00:58:01,640
looked around and I was like, oh my God, you have no idea the shit I believed. Oh my God,

747
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:06,760
it was like waking up from a year, year and a half long dream and having the memories of a

748
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:14,360
totally different person. I actually had my stepfather drive down to where my ex-fiancé,

749
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:18,360
and she was still in it, drove down after the first day, picked her up, brought her down,

750
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:24,120
and I shared the intervention with her. And so she would pop out of it. She was not as dedicated

751
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:28,280
as I was, but there was still the mind control going on with her.

752
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:36,680
In 1996, Dateline NBC delivered a critical blow to Lenzi's career, a primetime expose,

753
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:41,640
this time featuring an ex-member of Zazen, who was quick to call Lenzi out for sharing

754
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:47,800
songwriting credits with the band. I never, in my definition of composition and writing,

755
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:51,400
saw him write anything. What does he play? He doesn't play anything.

756
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:56,360
The film crew captured a Zazen jam session, showing what Lenz

757
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:59,160
psychically cleansing the music looked like in action.

758
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:04,920
Now let's go in the opposite way down.

759
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,200
Can I get funky?

760
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:21,960
He was apparently using a lot more drugs. I mean, he used LSD,

761
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:27,000
uppers and downers, and from one inside person told me he had also been using cocaine.

762
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,160
And he looked, you know, the last time he was on television was on Dateline program.

763
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:36,120
It was very thin. I got this Caucasian body and it's created all kinds of problems in the

764
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:40,280
West. I've never had one before. It's a new experience. I mean, it's to being shorter

765
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:47,000
and being in a land where I am understood. He wasn't as effective as an influencer

766
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:51,240
the last couple of years, and I think a lot of followers began to break away from him.

767
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:55,720
The segment also featured a newly defected Jim Piccarello,

768
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:59,880
who at times seemed stunned by his own story as he recounted it.

769
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:05,320
I thought that this guy can turn the room into gold. I was pretty much into it at the

770
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:09,960
beginning of the dinner. By the end of the dinner, I was willing to hang out with that group for

771
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:15,080
pretty much the rest of my life. Over time, not only did I see him turn the room gold,

772
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:21,000
which I saw it every single time during a retreat, a desert retreat. I saw him at night

773
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:27,160
skate on beams of light, you know, over the sand. Oh, I saw him disappear. I've seen him turn into a

774
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:33,240
woman into a Princeton's weird bug-like creature. I've seen them levitate. In the very beginning,

775
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:38,280
what did they do? They had us get into a trance state by meditating. And then they would talk about

776
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:45,080
what the experience is when you're with a enlightened being and you are spiritually sensitive.

777
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:49,480
A, you want to be spiritually sensitive and want to be better than other people. You're a person.

778
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:54,040
B, you're interested in being with an enlightened master. Because how cool would that be? You're

779
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:58,360
a special person who's learning stuff that no one else is learning. You're in a room with

780
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:03,240
300 people that believe this guy is enlightened. You've got the group dynamics that are shaping

781
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:08,200
your experience. And then when he comes out and he lowers the lights and gets you into

782
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:12,680
a state and you have a belief like, I want to be special. I want to follow someone who's special.

783
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:21,240
Start experiencing what they describe historical enlightened beings are like. And I saw gold.

784
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:33,000
In the early spring of 1998, Long Island police pulled the body of Frederick Lenz from the bottom

785
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:39,160
of a bay located behind one of his New York homes. A local reporter described a small crowd of

786
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:44,760
onlookers who'd gathered to watch the scene and the leading hypothesis that Lenz had been killed

787
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:50,040
by the parent of a student, someone who'd felt Lenz had, quote, brainwashed their kids.

788
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:55,800
Adding to this theory was a section of damaged railing along the pier where it was determined

789
01:01:55,800 --> 01:02:01,640
Lenz entered the water. But when the body was recovered, they found Lenz dressed in a Versace

790
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:08,120
suit with a dog collar buckled around his neck. The Scotty dog had died years before in a volume.

791
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:13,480
He had that dog collar on his neck. He claimed the buyer was his most enlightened student and

792
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:17,560
that they had been together many times in past lives. I mean, this is how delusional he was.

793
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:24,120
Inside Lenz's home were two other Scottish terriers and one student. The dogs were in

794
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:30,680
critical condition, having eaten volume that was hidden inside their dog food. The student had also

795
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:36,520
taken lethal amounts of barbiturates and was found staring at a framed photo of Lenz with a note

796
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:42,920
beside her that read, we all tried to go to the other world last night and only Rama made it.

797
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:48,120
Please help us make it to the other world. The woman was discovered by the housekeeper

798
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:53,720
when she came in and she got help and survived this overdose and so did the dogs by the way.

799
01:02:54,680 --> 01:03:01,720
After a toxicology report found that Lenz had ingested 150 tablets of value mixed with Vodka

800
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:05,400
prior to drowning, his death was deemed self-inflicted.

801
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:19,560
Beyond this world, beyond other worlds, be they interdimensional worlds or physical worlds,

802
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:26,040
there is something else which is that vast unknown that we call eternity. It is where we have come

803
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:33,240
from. It is that which is within us and it is where we eventually return. I can't tell you what that

804
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:40,680
is like. I have meditated and experienced that. I have tasted it and felt it. Then I went beyond

805
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:47,000
that to become it. The widespread reactions of followers to Lenz's death have mostly been lost

806
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:52,520
to time, but archived message boards show students sharing photos of group memorials

807
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:57,400
and a sudden urgency to reconnect with other members they might not have seen in years.

808
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:03,080
Oh, I actually found out about his death at my wedding. I was walking around with my friend Bob who

809
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:08,120
was involved in my intervention and we're walking around he goes oh what did you think about Lenz

810
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:14,680
dying and I was like what? I was just surprised that he tried to kill other beings which is so

811
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:20,760
un Buddhist. I was like okay well one less cult leader in the world. I was in my mid 20s. I didn't

812
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:29,000
have a lot of empathy for incredibly abusive sociopaths. Hi, my name is Rama and today I would

813
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:34,120
like to teach you how to meditate. Lenz never groomed a successor to lead the meditation group

814
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:39,880
in his absence. On the contrary, he'd been adamant that none of his students had come close to

815
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:44,600
achieving a level of consciousness that could be called enlightenment. So when my friends write me

816
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:48,840
and tell me they're enlightened, it's like someone who's just taken a second year French

817
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:54,120
course announcing that they've just completed their PhD. So the group continued without a living

818
01:04:54,120 --> 01:05:00,440
figurehead. Today the few remaining and incoming students have virtual meetups to discuss Lenz's

819
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:06,200
teachings or to watch his favorite movies. Some meditate on framed portraits of him they keep

820
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:13,320
in their homes. Others simulate his golden light with augmented reality and clips from his VHS tapes

821
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:18,520
will occasionally appear while scrolling YouTube shorts. When you meditate over a period of time

822
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:24,040
you'll come to see more and more of the many faces and sides of creation and in this one brief

823
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:29,800
lifetime you can experience ecstasy thousands and thousands of times. Why do you think someone like

824
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:35,960
Rama even after all these years still has a loyal fan base? There are other groups that are

825
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:40,680
selling his halt. One of the ones that's most successful these days is run by a guy they

826
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:46,360
call himself Sampara who's a lens offshoot or a Rama offshoot. His real name is Jeff Malone,

827
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:51,720
G-E-O-F-F Malone and his group's called the Buddha Dojo and it was called Awaken Mind at one time.

828
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:56,760
But it's very lens-like. When people approach that group they don't know that lens is behind it

829
01:05:56,760 --> 01:06:02,120
and they might never know but once you get deeply involved then you get its reveal that lens is the

830
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:08,200
Guru. You know it's just like in his day the seekers out there that want to believe that there's

831
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:12,760
people out there that are enlightened and they think that if they come across one they'll recognize

832
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:17,480
this person you know they all use this line when the the seeker is ready the Buddha will appear.

833
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:22,840
That's that line that's slow but it's probably gotten more and people into bizarre cults at

834
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:28,440
least Eastern groups than any other because people in their own narcissism think that they will have

835
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:34,680
this insight or this psychic power to recognize a real guru when they see one. It was lens's will

836
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:40,920
that is net worth which included several houses and cars totaling around 18 million dollars be

837
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:47,080
used to establish a charity in his name with the objective of quote disseminating Zen Buddhist

838
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:53,080
teachings meditation and yoga in the context of what I have taught as American Buddhism.

839
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:58,680
The Frederick P. Lenz Foundation for American Buddhism still exists today and claims to give

840
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:05,640
millions to Buddhist friendly causes across the world. In 2013 a follower named Liz Lewinson

841
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:12,040
crowdfunded 29,000 dollars in order to write a biography of Frederick Lenz titled Gaze in my

842
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:19,640
direction. It was New Year's Eve 1998 and he said to me you will be my biographer three months

843
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:26,280
later he was gone he staged his exit. Lewinson's account of Lenz covers much of the same time period

844
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:32,280
as Mark Laxer's memoir but the tone couldn't be more different. She describes the change of stage

845
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:38,360
names as Lenz incarnating into the Hindu god Rama. I don't like calling him Rama it's an insult to

846
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:43,640
those who actually follow either Hinduism or Buddhism and Lenz's reasons for breaking away

847
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:49,480
from Chinmoy having largely to do with Chinmoy's strict rule of celibacy. I went through terrible

848
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:55,560
times I went through times of self-hate thinking how undeveloped spiritually I was everyone else in

849
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:59,720
the ashram a thousand people nobody had a girlfriend or a boyfriend I did.

850
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:14,200
Sri Chinmoy never had the reputational downfall that Lenz experienced. Around the time of Lenz's

851
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:19,480
death the Chinmoy centers around the world were celebrating the completion of seven million bird

852
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:25,640
drawings. Chinmoy's students continued performing endurance challenges throughout the decades.

853
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:31,800
By the 1990s powerlifting had become Chinmoy's preferred method of demonstrating the supreme.

854
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:37,320
Whether he was calf raising a helicopter or an elephant or wrist curling a giant dumbbell

855
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:41,880
he always kept the cumulative weight prominently displayed for the audience to consider.

856
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:45,080
Go Guru come on up yes.

857
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:52,600
Occasionally he would combine his creative miracles for a show stopping finale.

858
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:56,440
Over close to 1500 books it gives you just a brief idea of how prolific

859
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:59,560
Guru is. He has written close to 1500 different books.

860
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:11,480
Chinmoy's sheer quantity of creative output has always been seen as dubious by those outside of

861
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:18,200
his meditation centers. And some of his more outlandish feats such as this lift listed at over

862
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:25,080
7,000 pounds were difficult for even his most loyal adherents to believe. But Chinmoy had a

863
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:31,640
seasoned defense. I don't blame people who suspect my performance he said my own mind suspects it.

864
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:39,480
When Chinmoy passed away in 2007 at the age of 76 the way he was eulogized in the media

865
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:47,080
couldn't have been more different from that of Frederick Lenz. Then in 2015 13x followers converged

866
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:53,160
to form a youtube channel called the Sree Chinmoy Disciple Experience. And you know it's very scary

867
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:57,400
and very daunting especially when you hear all the horror stories that Guru used to tell Sree

868
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:00,520
Chinmoy say oh if you leave the center you know you're gonna want them you're gonna get raped

869
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:04,840
you're gonna get cancer you're gonna the hostile force they're gonna capture. You know that was

870
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:10,600
like my only family because I had to cut off my real family for 21 years. I just had pretty much

871
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:16,120
resigned myself that that was it for this life you know just many times Guru said it's just one

872
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:21,400
incarnation and I thought to myself okay fine I can just give one incarnation for this. Being in

873
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:26,520
the meditation center was very much about trying not to be human. Certain parts of the being like

874
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:31,320
between here and here and everything else was meant to be dead. Targeted out by having me sit in

875
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:36,280
front of him and meditate and then he was like saying are you surrendered and I have my hands full

876
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:42,120
and I said supreme I bow to thee and then he was like oh are you really surrendered and then he

877
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:56,600
said take your clothes off. Unconditional surrender to the will of the supreme. The last development

878
01:10:56,680 --> 01:11:03,240
of the story of Frederick Lenz came in 2021 when the remains of Brenda Kerber a programmer and

879
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:10,440
meditation student who disappeared in 1988 were recovered. Her car had been driven into a reservoir

880
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:16,200
and act that police ruled intentional. She'd given up custody of her kids before her disappearance

881
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:21,480
and her diary entries indicate it was so she could move across the country to follow Lenz

882
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:23,960
who she referred to as golden boy.

883
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:35,320
So the cult awareness network seems to have dissolved in the late 1990s. Can you talk about

884
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:41,960
what happened? So uh Scientology was one of the groups that really went after any group that

885
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:47,320
criticized them and and especially hated the cult awareness network. They sued the can group 50

886
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:54,280
times. I got hit with 12 suits in one week. I would open the door a process server would give

887
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:59,800
me a suit. They were suing us all over the country sometimes simultaneously. There was a case in

888
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:06,600
the early 1990s where the programmer named Rick Ross took on a case in west it was a fundamentalist

889
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:12,520
Christian group where he takes a counsel teenage sons of a woman out of a group and then she wanted

890
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:18,840
her then 18 year old son exit counseled also and it didn't work. He had been kidnapped. He went

891
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:23,640
back to the group. Scientology got a hold of the young man and got him to run a lawsuit against

892
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:30,600
the cult awareness network based on the fact that Rick Ross had some vague connection to uh can even

893
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:36,280
though he didn't attend the meetings. Scientology's lawyers were quite adept at this kind of case

894
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:41,480
where can didn't have good representation because it was poorly funded and they couldn't afford

895
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:48,760
a good legal team. Scientology won the case. They bankrupted can bankrupt the the bankrupted

896
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:54,840
group had to sell its assets. The only top bidder was Scientology. So Scientology purchased can in

897
01:12:54,840 --> 01:13:00,520
1996. So whenever you call one of his old cult awareness network numbers in those books you would

898
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:05,640
end up talking to a Scientologist. What are you going to do when they're trying to destroy you?

899
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:11,320
Look if you're a Jew if you're if you're a Jew no no Jew is going to cry about the fact that the

900
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:16,040
Nazi party is gone. If you're an African-American no one's going to cry that the KKK is gone.

901
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:23,880
I'm not crying because can is gone. Yeah. Deprogramming still happens across the country

902
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:30,280
although it's rare to find cases labeled as involuntary after the 1990s. I still do cases.

903
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:35,160
The last case I did intervention case was in India. It was flown over there in September

904
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:40,600
and that case turned out fine. Many ex-Rama students still appear to be in the computer

905
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:45,800
programming industry. One former student is quoted as saying I don't agree with how he

906
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:51,480
treated women. I don't think he was enlightened whatever that is. What I did get from him was a

907
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:58,120
career. Others have turned their experience into cautionary tales. After leaving lenses

908
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:03,960
organization I didn't get cancer. I didn't get into a car crash. Since then I've had a number of

909
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:09,400
companies as an entrepreneur that I started and I moved up here to Maine and I built my own house

910
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:13,560
with my wife. We just read books on how to build a house and we did it. And in the last 10 years

911
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:20,120
I've discovered a love for rediscovered a love for filmmaking and screenwriting. I wrote a bunch

912
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:24,440
including the one I had mentioned before about two people falling in love as they try to save

913
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:29,320
each other from their respective cults. It's a dark rom-com called the cult of us.

914
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:36,120
But there may always be a market for the mystique of enlightenment as defined by those who

915
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:42,360
claim to have achieved it and in a reality where only they can teach it. Someone might say oh yes

916
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:45,640
Rama wonderful he's an enlightened teacher but gosh you know I just don't feel comfortable with him.

917
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:52,600
I feel more comfortable with people that someone else whose name we won't mention. Why won't I

918
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:56,920
mention it? Well you have to do some work. I mean there has to be some adventure here. Part of the

919
01:14:56,920 --> 01:15:01,640
test at least to get in is that you have to find them. It's hype and go see. And then you have to

920
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:05,640
believe them. I mean I could just be making all of this up. Maybe I'm not enlightened. Maybe it's

921
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:11,000
an extra double bluff where I'm just saying all this so you'll just think that I am. You see?

922
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:14,760
Who can tell? You can tell. You can tell and your heart can tell.

923
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:29,240
A big thanks to Jim Piccarello and Joe Zimhart. I wouldn't have been able to present this story

924
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:34,280
nearly as comprehensively without their openness to sharing their experiences.

925
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:39,560
All day long from morning until night I thought about this dude. Check out the links in the

926
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:44,360
description to find Joe's YouTube channel where he continues the cult monitoring work

927
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:49,720
he's been doing for decades and Jim's short films which have won many awards in independent

928
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:55,800
film festivals. I also want to give a shout out to a YouTube channel called Slave Obeyz.

929
01:15:55,800 --> 01:16:00,200
Without their efforts in archiving these talk shows from the 80s and 90s,

930
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:05,240
important information about these groups would have been lost to time. And this isn't the first

931
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:10,600
video of mine in which I've used archival clips from this channel so a shout out is long overdue.

932
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:15,240
Lastly, if you enjoyed this video and would like to support the channel,

933
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:21,000
my merch can be found at atrocityguide.com or you can support me directly on Patreon

934
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:26,840
where you'll get access to my Discord server as well as written progress reports on upcoming videos.
