 The lyrics you've provided appear to be from a song in Danish, which is a playful and humorous take on various themes including partying, socializing, and the experience of being out with friends. The song starts with greetings ("Risen hej," "Væse hej") and moves into a description of a lively atmosphere with people dancing ("Mjøchen trimmed, dem dim"), using flashing lights ("Dim dim"). It continues with references to enjoying the moment ("MÆI HUF"), dancing ("Da-dum-da-dum, mit tur trøm"), and an exhortation to let loose ("Haj os af, døm-døm").

The song also includes a section that seems to be about a chase or running away from something ("Aaah, diagnostic"), with a repetitive chorus of "Klej na hai klej na hai" (which translates to "Pants not here, pants not here") and a reminder to not forget one's "frist" (which could mean "pants" or "prescription," depending on the context).

The lyrics then repeat the dance and enjoyment themes with phrases like "High frist nyem nyem" (meaning "Get high, get high") and a chorus that emphasizes the fun ("Hej, frist, mjam, mjam"). The song concludes with more references to dancing and having a good time, as well as a reminder not to forget the "klejne" (pants/clothes).

Overall, the song is about celebrating life with friends, enjoying music and dance, and making sure to keep the good vibes going. It's a typical party anthem that encourages listeners to have fun and not worry too much about the small things like forgetting one's pants in the excitement of the moment.
