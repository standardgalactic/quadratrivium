1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,840
Thanks very much.

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:14,160
Archeology is not just about unearthing artifacts, it's sometimes about unearthing new information,

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,200
new photographs, new images in the archives, and these are just sort of a fun series of

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:22,120
photographs that I recently came across in the archives in the Bannoncroft Library at

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,160
University of California Berkeley, including my favorite Moevious on his first camel.

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,760
I don't know if you can work out the caption there in the lower side.

7
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,560
Some nice work that he was doing as a graduate student in the early 1930s at a site in Israel

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,280
called Mugaret S. School.

9
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,960
So as you've heard tonight is the annual Halamel Moevious Junior Lecturer.

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,440
Professor Moevious was a distinguished scholar, a curator and archaeologist here at Harvard

11
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,960
University.

12
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,680
He was really internationally recognized as a paleolithic archaeologist, but he did

13
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,680
a wide range of things.

14
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,680
This is really important.

15
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,960
His work ranged from the Irish Mesolithic to the sort of East Asian Lower Paleolithic

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,880
and probably most famously upper paleolithic sites such as Avery Patot in southwestern

17
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,400
France.

18
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,880
Importantly, with his appointment here in 1939 as curator in the Peabody and then later

19
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,480
in appointment as a lecturer in the Department of Anthropology in 1948, he was the first

20
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,880
paleolithic archaeologist working at Harvard.

21
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:22,480
So there's a tie-in here in that the point of me being up here is to introduce tonight's

22
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,600
speaker Dr. Stanley Ambrose, which I'm very happy to do.

23
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,480
The tie-in is twofold.

24
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:33,680
One, as I just learned, Stan is actually from the same hometown as Professor Moevious, Newton,

25
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,280
right here, attended UMass Boston as an undergraduate, but he was also received as PhD in 1984 at

26
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,000
the University of California, Berkeley, under Dr. Glenn Isaac, who then came here in 1983

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,840
as the second paleolithic archaeologist after Dr. Moevious's retirement.

28
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,640
So there's a nice tie-in there.

29
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,440
The other tie-in is that I think like Dr. Moevious and like the sort of mission of the

30
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,880
Harvard Museum of Science and Culture, Dr. Ambrose's research and his research interest

31
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,080
really cut across a wide range of different time periods.

32
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,600
It involves work from a wide diversity of different geographic locations, and it really

33
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,640
embraces a sort of natural science approach to figuring out the past, not just archaeology,

34
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:17,720
but really embracing a wide variety of different ways of thinking about reconstructing the human

35
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,680
past and the environment in which early humans lived.

36
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,400
So tonight, one part of this, as you'll hear, Professor Ambrose will be discussing the archeological

37
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,960
evidence for the impact of enormous volcanic eruption at Mount Toba about 74,000 years

38
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,680
ago and how this might have impacted human populations.

39
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,560
But what I want you to get a sense of is this is just one small part of what he does.

40
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,040
Really Dr. Ambrose's research interest range from everything from African archaeology from

41
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,040
the Iron Age to quite recent periods to the sort of deepest early Stone Age.

42
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,880
He's done work on Miocene apes, interests in the study of modern human origins more

43
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:59,120
broadly, paleoecology, human diet, using isotopes in particular, looking at sites from China,

44
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,720
Kenya, stone tool analysis, language, the evolution of cooperation.

45
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,880
The list really does go on for quite some time.

46
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,840
Looking at these topics, answering these questions have taken him to field sites in

47
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:16,640
Kenya, Ethiopia, India, and Australia, and I'm sure other places as we might learn.

48
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,080
His work has been published widely in things such as the Journal of Archaeological Science

49
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,080
or Nature.

50
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,160
He's published a number of co-authored books as well.

51
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,680
And perhaps not surprisingly, his research has been well funded by the National Science

52
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,920
Foundation in particular, recognizing his repeated innovative research projects.

53
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,360
So the list of accomplishments could go on for quite some time.

54
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,640
But I'd like to notice sort of a personal note that I've known Stan for about 15 years

55
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,640
now.

56
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,440
And during that time, I've often drawn on his sort of encyclopedic knowledge and I think

57
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,680
a particularly good skill of knowing a good idea from a bad idea.

58
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,960
And he's helped me sort of pursue the good ideas and not the bad ones quite often in

59
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,960
the past.

60
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,960
For that, I thank him.

61
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,600
So with that, please join me in welcoming Dr. Stanley Ambrose.

62
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:10,040
Well, thank you, Christian, for that generous introduction.

63
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,800
I don't know if I deserve all of it.

64
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,560
I hope my voice carries.

65
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,520
I've got a bit of a rough throat.

66
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,080
I should open up this water bottle.

67
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:31,040
Thank you all for coming and especially Professor Moevious's children here.

68
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,480
I never got to meet Professor Moevious, but I feel like I should know him.

69
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:42,040
I mention him in almost every class I teach.

70
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:47,720
And he's on my exams.

71
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:57,800
And well, there'll be no exam after tonight's talk, but I'm going to move widely.

72
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:05,200
I was looking at something that he wrote in 1948 and he actually mentions the volcanic

73
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,680
ash from the eruption that I'll be talking about tonight.

74
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:16,320
So this is something that was well known.

75
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,080
Can everybody hear me all right?

76
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,560
Okay, good.

77
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,920
Let's see where we're going.

78
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:30,600
Well, first of all, Kano in winter in erupting, this is up in the Kamchatka Peninsula.

79
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:38,440
And I'm going to talk about a much larger eruption than this and how it affected population

80
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:43,800
history and I'll try to explain to you how we go about identifying population history

81
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:50,560
from the genes and how the consequences of this eruption may have changed the environment

82
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:58,960
in ways that favored a new pathway, a new direction in human evolution.

83
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:05,480
And I like to call this new direction the troop to tribe transition.

84
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:15,360
I'd like to just define troops and tribes for you in the way that fits my real interests.

85
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,560
A lot of people around the world are very interested in the evolution of cooperation.

86
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:27,920
There are people on Harvard University campus writing books about how evolution favors cooperation.

87
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,720
I would disagree that it always favors cooperation.

88
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,280
We know about competition, there's a lot of writing about competition.

89
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:41,040
If we think about most of our primate relatives, they live in what we call troops that live

90
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,920
in closed territories.

91
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:48,620
They may have tightly knit cooperative, sometimes not so cooperative relationships within their

92
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:54,200
troop and on a regular basis they go to the boundaries of their territories and they make

93
00:06:54,200 --> 00:07:01,480
noises and in the case of chimpanzees, they may actually look for lone troop members from

94
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,680
the adjacent troop and try to kill them.

95
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,360
Richard Rangham has written extensively about this, Professor Rangham here in the Anthropology

96
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,720
Department.

97
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:17,520
So the question is, to what extent did we have in our past a troop-like kind of organization

98
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,200
and when did we really break out of it?

99
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,920
We may not have broken out of it entirely.

100
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:31,880
So small, closed, defended territories is what I think of as troops.

101
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:38,400
Human tribes have regional networks of communities that people visit, they have relationships

102
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,200
between them, they can go out and visit and they can come home again.

103
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:48,560
Most primates are on a one-way trip and I'll talk about one exception later.

104
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,680
We have positive relationships.

105
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:56,120
We have names for people in other groups, sometimes they're fictional names.

106
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:02,000
We can talk about brothers in arms and these are important human innovation to be able

107
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,440
to make a symbolic name for something and then behave as if they are your brother or

108
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,840
your sister or your uncle, so forth.

109
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:18,920
Now modern hunter-gatherers in arid and risky environments tend to have the greatest extent

110
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,840
of their social networks.

111
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,600
This could contrast with some agricultural communities, many of them who live in very

112
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:36,960
stable environments, do you think of the Yanamamo in South American forests or Papua New Guinea?

113
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:43,400
To call them tribes is being contested by John Yellen and Henry Harpending who are also

114
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:49,560
of Harvard University here and they wrote about this in World Archaeology.

115
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,920
They didn't use the troop to try distinction, it's very hard to actually find mention of

116
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:59,560
this in the literature, but when we teach our anthropology courses and evolution courses

117
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:04,920
we always talk about primate troops and then we talk about two and a half million year

118
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:10,120
old stone tool using meat-eating groups.

119
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:18,500
To what extent did they have an intergroup favorable reciprocal relationships?

120
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:24,080
This question came to me in the middle of a lecture and then I realized that maybe it

121
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:30,320
wasn't as far back in time as we would necessarily assume.

122
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,840
So let's talk about volcanoes and a little bit of art.

123
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:43,120
This is Turner, I haven't seen the movie yet, I don't think it got any Oscars.

124
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:52,640
But in 1815, Tambora erupted in between Java and Sumatra, I think it was, and the skies

125
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:59,160
turned gloomy for several years, 1816 was a year without a summer.

126
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:06,120
These amazing sunsets and the atmospherics were incredible, it looks like Beijing where

127
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:14,840
I was about two months ago in the bottom one, pretty thick air.

128
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:23,800
A lot of things happened in that summer and Lord Byron with his guests at his summer home

129
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:30,360
on the shores of Lake Geneva wrote, this is just a little excerpt from his poem, the bright

130
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,720
sun was extinguished and the stars did wander, darkling in the eternal space, I won't read

131
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,880
the whole thing, it goes quite a long time and it gets more dismal and there's death

132
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,880
in it.

133
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:51,360
And one of his house guests was Mary Shelley and Mary Shelley created this story then.

134
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:57,800
I won't attribute it entirely to the volcano.

135
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:05,680
This is what happens to the atmosphere when a large low latitude, high explosive eruption

136
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,320
occurs that has a lot of sulfur gases in the mix.

137
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:17,760
This was Pinatubo and you can see the distribution of the sulfur gas as it went around the world

138
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,960
over 12 weeks.

139
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:28,600
It was the largest sulfur exhalation and it went up about 20 miles into the stratosphere

140
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:37,920
and spread around the world for a couple of years at least, there was a one degree temperature

141
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:46,200
drop, Tambora was quite a bit more severe with a larger eruption.

142
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:54,960
Now I got involved with this when I saw this paper that was published in Nature in 1992

143
00:11:54,960 --> 00:12:06,640
by Michael Rampino and Steven Self and they proposed that the eruption of Toba in Sumatra,

144
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:13,960
73, 74,000 years ago, it's the largest crater lake in the world right now, produced enough

145
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:20,840
sulfuric acid that was in the stratosphere to reflect sunlight for five to six years

146
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:25,920
and cause a volcanic winter just like the nuclear winter scenarios that were popular

147
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,320
in the 80s and they're still being modeled and considered.

148
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:37,880
Billions of tons of sulfur were ejected into the stratosphere according to them and it

149
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:45,320
may have initiated the last glacial era at 70,000 years ago.

150
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:51,600
The climate records were not very detailed then but that was the idea.

151
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,560
They become much more detailed and we'll look at some of them and the volcanic ash was found,

152
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:03,640
here's Toba down here, volcanic ash was found halfway across the Indian Ocean.

153
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,280
One of my mentors at Berkeley in grad school was Desmond Clark.

154
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:14,400
He went to India in 1980 and 81, 82 with a little team when they couldn't go to Ethiopia

155
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:21,520
to find early hominids and early archaeological sites and Martin Williams, who I've worked

156
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:30,440
with in India and in Kenya and in Australia now, found a volcanic ash layer halfway across

157
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:37,280
India and it turned out to correlate and it looks like India was covered with at least

158
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,200
10 centimeters of volcanic ash.

159
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,240
We'll talk a little bit more about that later.

160
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,000
How big was the eruption?

161
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,480
The eruption happened new date 73,880 years ago.

162
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,960
That's a nice date.

163
00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:01,760
When I saw the talk that this table came from, I was about to fall asleep and then I saw

164
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,800
that Toba produced 800 cubic kilometers.

165
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:15,800
The estimate was in 1990, 1992, 800 cubic kilometers of rock blasted into the atmosphere

166
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:21,520
and the total eruptive volume has been estimated to be 2,700 cubic kilometers.

167
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,880
That's a lot.

168
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:31,960
So that was in 1992 and by the year 2002, the ash had been found, I think, out into

169
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:36,400
the Arabian Sea.

170
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:42,400
So it was getting bigger as more research was being done.

171
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,480
There's Yellowstone at about the same scale for comparison.

172
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,240
The eruptions, the super eruptions from Yellowstone.

173
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,760
Now by 2008, they started thinking it was even bigger and you can see Pinatubo's ash

174
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:01,720
fall area and Tambora the year without a summer.

175
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,960
That looks pretty big.

176
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:12,920
In 2012, ash was discovered and chemically fingerprinted fairly precisely.

177
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:18,360
In two cores drilled into the muds in the bottom of Lake Malawi.

178
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:23,720
That gets us to about 21 million kilometers square and probably closer to 2,000 cubic

179
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,160
kilometers of a dense rock equivalent.

180
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:32,000
Even out here in the Indian Ocean, about the same distance as across the United States,

181
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,760
it was up to 34 centimeters thick.

182
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:39,440
That's a little bit more than a foot thick, 14 inches.

183
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,440
That's amazing.

184
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,360
The Yellowstone ash has never been found east of the Mississippi despite the prevailing

185
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,320
winds.

186
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,200
It's getting bigger.

187
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:58,520
In April last year, it was reported all the way down there in the south coast of South

188
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,520
Africa.

189
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:08,640
Near the bottom of a sand layer that occurs for maybe 100 miles along the coast.

190
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:13,600
This wind-blown sand layer seems to represent an interesting climatic event.

191
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:20,440
I'll come back to the cultural changes that seem to be marked by this sand layer.

192
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,720
The search is now really on for finding this ash just about everywhere.

193
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:32,520
It's hard to find it because it's little individual cryptic shards of glass.

194
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,680
But there's no volcanoes in South Africa.

195
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:41,360
They can be chemically fingerprinted with microscopic techniques.

196
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,920
Here's the, this is called the two-mile time machine.

197
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:54,080
Every core that's drilled into the ice in the Arctic can go down about two miles before

198
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:59,840
the ice gets very deformed and you lose a detailed climate record.

199
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,280
But you can get annual layering.

200
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,240
This is the second mile down.

201
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,520
The first mile covers 10,000 years of a Greenland ice core.

202
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:16,440
Second mile covers 110,000, 120,000 years.

203
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:22,840
When the curve goes down, we're looking at low oxygen isotope ratios.

204
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,840
That's cold.

205
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,760
When it goes up, we're looking at warm.

206
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:31,280
The last 10,000 years, 12,000 years is just at the top of the graph and it stays that

207
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,840
way to the present.

208
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:38,440
A warm wet period where ice is accumulated rapidly.

209
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:46,480
What's interesting is that Toba produced enough sulfuric acid to leave a very large

210
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:54,920
patch of a very acidic ice, sulfuric acid, haze that finally precipitated out.

211
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,800
And it was already in an ice age.

212
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:05,600
So we can get a simple answer to Rampino and Self's question, did it cause the last

213
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,600
ice age?

214
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,920
The last ice age was pretty much all the way there.

215
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,600
However, it went a little further.

216
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:22,200
So these ups and downs, pairs of them are called Greenland events and there, the S stands

217
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,080
for stadial.

218
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,360
There's a little I there that stands for interstadial.

219
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,280
The I's are warm, the S's are cold.

220
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,400
So that's the interstadial, stadial.

221
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,680
And that was stadial 20.

222
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:42,800
Now it definitely did not cause the last ice age because after 1800 years of the coldest,

223
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:50,720
temperatures recorded in 123,000 years worth of ice, it got abruptly warm, 16 degrees Celsius,

224
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,880
that's about 27 degrees Fahrenheit, increase in warmth.

225
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:02,320
So again, this eruption may have done something to exacerbate the cold here, make it the coldest

226
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:08,280
of one of these instant ice ages, and that's what I call them, lasted 1800 years, but didn't

227
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,960
cause the last ice age.

228
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:17,600
Last ice age then came, and it's from about 70,000 to 60,000 years ago.

229
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:25,240
That's a long time for almost unrelenting cold, a few little blips of warm, and that's

230
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,840
the last glacial maximum as it's commonly known when the mammoth hunters were killing

231
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,720
off the last of the woolly mammoths.

232
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:38,800
It was colder, it was a tough time, and the people weren't as technologically sophisticated

233
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,880
or so we may think back then.

234
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:49,120
So I call that marine isotope, I don't call that, it's been called marine isotope stage 4.

235
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:56,000
This is marine isotope stage 5, a predominantly warm and wet period.

236
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,760
But this is the flickering switch of last glacial climate.

237
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:09,360
This is a stage of predominantly cold, stage 3 is predominantly warm, stage 2 sort of dips

238
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:15,640
down into what we call the last glacial maximum, and then the last 10,000 years is warm.

239
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:28,240
So Toba erupted after the onset of one of these instant ice ages, and you could argue

240
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,640
that it made it the coldest and stayed cold.

241
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:39,080
So if we look in detail at it, we can see the sulfur in centimeter by centimeter of

242
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:53,760
the ice at a depth of about 2,591.05 meters, that's about two miles down.

243
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:59,160
And that's the most sulfur in the core, so whoops, going backwards.

244
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:03,800
I thought this was an arrow pointing to where the sulfur spike was, but it's actually the

245
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:08,760
height of the sulfur spike, and it's six years wide.

246
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,360
And there's more later.

247
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:19,280
Dust increases dramatically as well during this 1,800 year period, and then dust drops

248
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:27,320
away when that warm period comes, interstitial 19, and then we go for 10,000 years of that

249
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:34,360
very cold period with lots more dust, very little vegetation to hold the soil down, very

250
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,360
cold at that time.

251
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,760
This is just a bit of a detail on it.

252
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:46,920
So this is just to emphasize that the eruption didn't cause a cold period, but I think it

253
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,480
may have exacerbated it.

254
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,160
Now I've done some research in India, as I mentioned.

255
00:21:54,160 --> 00:22:03,200
This is the Saan River, Narmada, and that's near Rajasthan, volcanic ash has been found

256
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,280
in many, many more places than this, but these are places that I've done work on the volcanic

257
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,280
ash.

258
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:16,520
This is where Toba is, and I'll just show you a few of these places.

259
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:21,360
This is the type site where Martin Williams, with his grad student, Royce, they came upon

260
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:28,200
that pale layer there, and Martin said to Royce, if this was Ethiopia, that would be

261
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,640
a volcanic ash.

262
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,480
I'd better take a double sample, and he did.

263
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:42,960
Then we came back when I developed my specialty of analyzing soils, and we cleared off a nice

264
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,080
section and sampled.

265
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:55,480
That's Parth Chauhan, and part of our team there, and I'm working with him elsewhere.

266
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,680
He's at about the top of the volcanic ash.

267
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:04,440
It's a little bit brown here, a little bit upriver.

268
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:11,800
The ash actually is pretty pure down to the bottom, gets reworked, and the soil is ashy

269
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,480
all the way up to there.

270
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,880
That's my behind.

271
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,920
Sampling the soils for analysis.

272
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,880
There's a close up of the ash.

273
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:29,720
It's bright white, 10 centimeters across India, and probably elsewhere.

274
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:35,200
You know what happens when bright white stuff falls on the ground around here?

275
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,820
This doesn't melt.

276
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,080
It reflects sunlight.

277
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,680
That's called albedo.

278
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,160
It's reflectance.

279
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,680
Ice and snow have high reflectance.

280
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:52,120
This bright white ash could have helped the cooling.

281
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:59,120
The aerosol, parasol gas, so to speak, the fine mist that was ejected, the sulfuric

282
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:04,560
acid is white, makes a white haze that is an effective reflector of sunlight.

283
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:09,080
That's why big volcanic eruptions cause global cooling.

284
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,440
They have to be low latitudes because that's where most of the sunlight falls to really

285
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,600
have an impact.

286
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,280
October was low latitude.

287
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:25,600
Chemical fingerprint was distinctive and identified all over the place.

288
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:34,040
One of the things I do is I analyze the carbon in soils, not the carbon-14, the carbon-13,

289
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:42,520
which is not radioactive, and it's ratioed to the common carbon, carbon-12.

290
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:49,880
Here has given us a nice natural label, like a tracer that, in biomedicine, they'd give

291
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,360
you a radioactive tracer.

292
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,040
There's a natural tracer.

293
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,960
These are low 13C content plants.

294
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:05,560
They include trees and shrubs and rice and wheat and potatoes and non-tropical grasses.

295
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:10,680
These are called C4 plants, and they have much higher carbon-13 content, and there's

296
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:18,440
nothing in between, and they are mainly tropical grasses.

297
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:25,960
If we have a warm forest in the tropics and it's wet, we get 13C values of the soil that

298
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,480
look like this.

299
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:34,160
If it's a dry open grassland, we get 13C values that look like this in the organic carbon.

300
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:38,720
Calcium carbonate, the same stuff that chalk and limestone is made out of, forms in the

301
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,960
soil, and it also acquires the carbon isotope ratios of the plants.

302
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:54,480
That is offset by 14, so we can move the numbers here to be 14 for 100% woody plants, herbs,

303
00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:02,280
trees, forest, and somewhere around zero to a little bit more for grasses.

304
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:08,280
I've done some analyses at three sites, and these are three separate sites in their graphs.

305
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:15,600
I've shown you these two, and that's 500 centimeters above the base of the ash, and then it goes

306
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:22,560
down to about 200 centimeters below the ash.

307
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:27,040
Each of these graphs goes from trees to grass.

308
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:33,720
Let's see if I've got that labeled here.

309
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,720
There we are.

310
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,880
These are all of the sites where we excavated and sampled soils.

311
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:45,680
The carbon isotope ratio of the soils underneath the ash showed forest.

312
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:49,920
One exception, that one bit.

313
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:55,800
Inside the ash and near the top of the ash, whoops, going the wrong way.

314
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,800
This helps.

315
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:02,320
13C values shifted up with more grass.

316
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:11,960
This really long section stayed with lots of grass for a considerable time, maybe 2,000

317
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,960
years.

318
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,200
We don't know exactly.

319
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:21,520
Soils above the ash supported C4, grassy woodland to grassland.

320
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:31,440
Put simply, the eruption fell on a very forested landscape, over 400 kilometers that we sampled,

321
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,040
and after the eruption, there was grassland.

322
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:40,560
Central India was deforested by the Toba eruption.

323
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:44,520
Now, what are some of the broader impacts?

324
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:54,200
We can go to the fossil record closer to Toba, Southeast Asia, and Lois has identified about

325
00:27:54,200 --> 00:28:00,760
11 or 12 large mammal extinctions, either total extinctions or regional extinctions.

326
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:06,760
What really is interesting to me is that orangutans used to live on mainland Southeast Asia.

327
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:11,560
Their last appearance date is somewhere around the time of Toba.

328
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,600
Orangutans really don't do well on the ground.

329
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:23,560
They have four arms, they don't really have legs, and that's just one of the species.

330
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,960
He says it's not significant.

331
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,120
That's 12 more extinctions than I've ever said happened.

332
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:34,560
Now, let's switch from the paleontology and talk about genetics.

333
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:41,360
As long ago as 1972, the geneticists studying the patterns of genetic diversity observed

334
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:49,640
that there wasn't enough genetic diversity in humans alive today to account for the amount

335
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,320
of time we've had a fossil record of humanity.

336
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:59,200
And John Hay and John Maynard Smith proposed that about five times the age of the origins

337
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,440
of agriculture, which gets us to about 60,000 to 70,000 years old, there was a long period

338
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:10,440
of very low population size where much of the genetic diversity was lost.

339
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:15,160
And there have been a small number of mutations accumulating since that period that differentiate

340
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,160
people.

341
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:24,000
But most of the mutations that we should see, the genetic diversity we should see, is missing.

342
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
So that was a mystery.

343
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,040
It goes all the way back to 1972.

344
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:33,080
So this just happens to be a period from when Toba, all the way up through marine isotope

345
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:39,200
stage four, that early glacial maximum, they didn't know anything about this.

346
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:46,720
Now, this is how geneticists just pretend I'm a tree, okay?

347
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,760
I had to give a talk once where I had no graphics and I just, you know, nothing to show on.

348
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,720
And I said, well, just pretend, imagine I'm a tree.

349
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,480
This is a tree that's growing.

350
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,720
It's not lost any branches.

351
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:04,440
And the lineages, so to speak, each branch has survived for a very long time.

352
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:09,520
So to get back to the common ancestor of this tips of the branches and those tips of the

353
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,720
branches, you have to go way down to the trunk.

354
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,440
It's down in the lower garden there.

355
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,640
It's in Kenya, but it's a tree from India.

356
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,760
It makes a lovely shade.

357
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:26,440
This is a jacaranda that was trimmed and it's got three main trunks.

358
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:34,200
It once had long branches, but now with the decimation, new sprouts have come up all at

359
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,400
about the same time.

360
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:40,440
Now, we can imagine if a human population or any animal species or even plant species

361
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:50,920
population is reduced to a small number, then they become the progenitors of everybody afterwards.

362
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:55,960
And if you measure the length of these, you can say from this branch tip to that branch

363
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:04,720
tip divided by two, knowing the growth rate gets us back to about the time of the chopping.

364
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,800
And then to get to another main trunk, you have to go much further.

365
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,520
This is the picture of Africa, actually.

366
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:19,520
There's a lot of different main branches and subdivisions that all coalesce to large trunks

367
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:26,720
and then the large branches coalesce to a main trunk.

368
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:33,520
On one of these side branches here, two of these wisps account for everybody outside

369
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,520
of Africa.

370
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,000
I'll show you that.

371
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,640
But let's do a little simulation here.

372
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:48,120
I'm going to teach you how we can turn a theoretical family tree, one ancestor, two ancestors,

373
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:56,360
and then these four sisters, if we can say these are females, give rise all at about

374
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:02,280
the same time, maybe when the climate got good, to a bunch of people, lineages that

375
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,560
have survived to the present.

376
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:09,000
Each of these little X's would be a mutation along a lineage that differentiates them.

377
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,480
And you could cut up the number of mutational units that separate this person from the other

378
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:20,680
49 and do these pairwise comparisons and then calculate some statistics and get a frequency

379
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:24,080
distribution of the number of pairwise differences.

380
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:30,760
If there was a population explosion at seven mutational units of time in the past, then

381
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:35,200
you get this kind of a hump, wave-like distribution.

382
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,960
So population expansions make waves that look like this.

383
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,800
Let's look at some humans and apes.

384
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:49,120
So if the expansion was recent, there might only be instead of seven site differences,

385
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,800
there might be two or three.

386
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:57,520
And we could call this a rake-like expansion of rake-like family tree, but with short times

387
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:01,560
means a recent expansion.

388
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:08,040
Only a few mutations have accumulated in all the lineages from the ancestral lineage.

389
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:12,800
If it was further back in time, we would get longer tines on the rake, and there would

390
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,720
be little sub-tines poking out.

391
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,720
Okay.

392
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:28,480
So here we have three branches within the western chimpanzees that have exploded at about the

393
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,960
same time.

394
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,440
So we could call these clades or branches.

395
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:38,920
So we have three nested clades within the western chimpanzees.

396
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,880
They coalesce back to Nigerians.

397
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,280
Eastern chimpanzees have one big expansion.

398
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,680
Central chimpanzees don't look like they expanded.

399
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:53,680
There have been stable populations that have had lineages that have survived for a long

400
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,680
time.

401
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:58,360
This is 811 humans from around the world.

402
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:04,920
Not much genetic diversity at all, less than the eastern chimpanzees.

403
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:11,040
And here's where Neanderthals fit in.

404
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,040
Okay.

405
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:19,480
So eastern chimpanzees, which live in the most ecologically sensitive areas, most likely

406
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:25,680
to get their forests dried up during ice ages, have the smallest genetic diversity among

407
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:30,000
the chimps, almost like humans.

408
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,880
And here's what it looks like when we turn it into that wave-like distribution, the frequency

409
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,880
distribution.

410
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,600
Modern humans almost know genetic diversity.

411
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:43,400
Eastern chimpanzees, an interesting little bump here, won't have time to talk about that.

412
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:50,240
Central, Nigerian, western chimpanzees, gorillas.

413
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:58,360
So we look like we're missing most of our genetic diversity around the world.

414
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:05,000
If we compare different human populations, take the nested clade approach, we can see

415
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:15,400
that the people in Africa that belong to a maternal group that's been called L has the

416
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,880
greatest number of genetic differences among people.

417
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:30,520
If we compare people from southern, eastern Asia, Australasia, including Australians and

418
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:38,080
Melanesians and so forth, they have slightly more genetic diversity than northern Eurasians.

419
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:44,280
And we can put a time of the beginning of the expansion, this peak here, in terms of

420
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:50,360
number of mutational units and how much time it took those mutations to accumulate.

421
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:57,800
This is about 70, 60, and 50,000 years ago.

422
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,000
So that's an interesting thing.

423
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:07,480
Populations expanding sometime about after Toba erupts, and then these populations are

424
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:17,040
expanding out of Africa at the end of that very cold marine isotope stage four that was

425
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:21,000
very cold from 70 to 60.

426
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:29,960
So the reconstruction that's been made of this is that people out of this subgroup of

427
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:37,080
the L lineage went across the south end of the Red Sea, the Babel Mandeb Straits called

428
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:45,680
the Gates of Tears, and another subpopulation of this L3 went out across the Sinai.

429
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:50,680
And the ones that went out across the Sinai we call N subgroup, and the ones that went

430
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:59,960
out across the south end of the Red Sea are in the M subgroup of the L3 of East Africa.

431
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:03,600
Now they originated in East Africa.

432
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:11,560
The most diverse branches of these M's and N's are in Kenya, Tanzania, and Ethiopia.

433
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:15,240
So everybody outside of Africa is not just an African.

434
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,840
They're an East African.

435
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:24,920
Very different from the West African L0s, 1s, and 2s.

436
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:29,040
So this is the whole family tree on the maternal DNA.

437
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,640
Goes back to 200,000 years.

438
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,480
Here's our L3 and a little bit of L4.

439
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:41,520
And these two little subbranches of L3 are the non-Africans.

440
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:48,080
There's more genetic difference between individuals in a single African village than there is

441
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:58,200
between people from Asia, Japan, all the way to Iceland, from Australia to Iceland.

442
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,200
Okay.

443
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:05,520
Oh, yeah, one more thing about this.

444
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:11,600
Lots of lineages, these are major lineages, were founded in this period around 80,000

445
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,320
to 70,000, 60,000 years ago.

446
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,280
The genetic dating is not very tight.

447
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,320
It's got big error margins.

448
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:25,120
So other populations, other species that have gone through population expansions from small

449
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:30,920
sizes include chimpanzees, the Eastern chimpanzees, lowland gorillas.

450
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:38,040
Nuclear DNA was shared between West Africa and East Africa.

451
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:42,480
Eastern and Western lowland gorillas are presently separated by thousands of miles.

452
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,480
They were exchanging genes 77,000 years ago.

453
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,440
Big surprise.

454
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,960
Gorillas have a bottleneck around 70,000 or expansion.

455
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:57,680
Macaque monkeys in central India, about 55,000 years.

456
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:06,280
All tigers on earth have one lucky mother, 73,000 years ago, according to the geneticists

457
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,320
Luo.

458
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:16,880
And ancient DNA tells us about cave bears in their population history and Neanderthals.

459
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,400
That was a big surprise.

460
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,080
Let's look at Neanderthals.

461
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,240
First we'll just look at orangutans.

462
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,560
So there's fossil orangutans that gone.

463
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:32,400
Let's compare Borneo to Sumatra and orangutan genetics.

464
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:38,480
There, that's a garden rate that looks like it's been worn down to a stub.

465
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,720
Hardly any distance between all of the individuals, genetic distance.

466
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:47,400
So the length of these teeth is practically zero.

467
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:52,440
And it turns into this pair-wise frequency of just a few differences.

468
00:39:52,440 --> 00:40:02,840
The Sumatran ones, it's a funny way of drawing it, but to go from this patch of orangutan

469
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:08,040
DNA sequences to that one, you have to go all the way back to there.

470
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:12,320
And they're the ones that are scattered out here with many genetic differences between

471
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,240
pairs of individuals.

472
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,360
So let's look at Neanderthals.

473
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:23,200
This paper was published in Science, well this is just the cover story.

474
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:30,920
Neanderthal bones and their DNA has been giving up their DNA for a couple of decades now.

475
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:35,760
And some of them now go off this map.

476
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,160
And this covers Western Europe.

477
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:46,400
These are all Neanderthals that died, radiocarbon dated somewhere around 40, 45,000 years ago.

478
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:50,880
East Toba eruption.

479
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,640
The ones that have yielded their DNA, these are all very closely related.

480
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:59,000
And you can see Africans here for comparison.

481
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,440
Very deep branches in the African DNA, there's our L3.

482
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:10,160
And you can see that the M and N are just subsets of the whole L3, non-Africans.

483
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:18,040
So we are all East Africans unless we're from West Africa or South Africa.

484
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:23,080
So this paper was published in 2012 with more DNA sequences.

485
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:27,680
And you can see this short-time garden rake kind of distribution.

486
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,280
They're dead by about 40,000.

487
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:38,840
Their common maternal ancestor for all of them in Western Europe lived 60,000 years ago.

488
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:43,160
Coincidentally, the end of that very cold period.

489
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,400
Marine isotope stage four.

490
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,440
So this population expanded.

491
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,880
There are the dates, it's maybe hard to see.

492
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,840
And they lived for 20,000 years.

493
00:41:53,840 --> 00:42:00,920
It was about 43,000 years ago when people from Africa made it that far into Western Europe.

494
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:07,640
So Western Europe was depopulated according to the geneticists.

495
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:15,880
Sometime in the early last Ice Age and repopulated 60,000 years ago.

496
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:19,120
I kind of like this.

497
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,160
What were Neanderthals like?

498
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,920
How well did they behave?

499
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,440
Everything you thought about them was true.

500
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,560
And that includes me.

501
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:38,480
I found out when I graduated high school that I was Neanderthal man, Newton high.

502
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:44,600
Okay, the fossil record of them, the archaeological record of them is not pretty.

503
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:48,760
There's lots of interpersonal violence and trauma.

504
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:56,720
This is a painting from reconstruction of what was going on at Krapina in Croatia.

505
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:01,680
Where they had 49 individuals, most of whom were butchered.

506
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,480
He's cradling somebody's head in his lap.

507
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,400
This one's breaking open the femur.

508
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:13,320
This guy's chewing on another long bone of one of his neighbors.

509
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,640
We're very nice to each other.

510
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:22,840
Most archaeological sites have little scraps of Neanderthal bone that have traces of burning cut marks and hammer marks on them.

511
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,760
You don't hear about most of these.

512
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:36,760
You hear about the full skeletons that are severely arthritic, traumatized, healed bones, broken bones, re-healed, lots of nasty stuff.

513
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,200
Cannibalism.

514
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:47,360
They used stone tools that you would imagine you could find, not just imagine, you can find the geological sources.

515
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:56,200
Within the home range of a hunter-gatherer in a relatively rich territory.

516
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:00,720
They don't look like they were planning their predation very well.

517
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,840
The arguments about how much they scavenged versus hunted.

518
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:11,080
They had small home ranges by the stone tool site to source distances.

519
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:15,600
They engaged in strenuous activities for most of the day.

520
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,480
Giving them all this arthritis.

521
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,760
They had short lifespans.

522
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:23,400
It's been argued that they didn't live long enough to be grandparents.

523
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:28,080
And that's important for social learning, I think, and for survival.

524
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:34,160
They carried around stone tools that archaeologists loved to classify.

525
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:40,960
And I'm a primary practitioner of Professor Movious's craft and skill.

526
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:48,040
So I know just how disappointing some of these tool kits can be, the early ones,

527
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:54,040
because it's easier to say what they did to a rock than what you call it.

528
00:44:54,040 --> 00:45:04,080
Later in time, you can look at artifacts and say, ah, that's a type 22, no doubt about it.

529
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,120
They seem to have been strongly territorial.

530
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,360
Were they like chimpanzee troops?

531
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,520
That's the question.

532
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:15,600
Now, let's look at some of the archaeology I've done just very briefly.

533
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:20,200
I've been working in Kenya for a long time, about 40 years.

534
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,840
These two areas are lots of fun.

535
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:27,760
This is one of the sites in the southern area along the Intuka River.

536
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,520
And down here at the bottom, there's a volcanic ash you can't really see.

537
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,880
It's not the Tobash.

538
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:37,160
It's about 52,000 years down there.

539
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:40,960
We get some of these large, generalized, all-purpose tools,

540
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:48,280
like this large spearhead-sized, big knife thing, and little small blade segments.

541
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:55,520
Very sharp obsidian volcanic glass comes from about 70, 80 kilometers away.

542
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,760
These are all-purpose tools.

543
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:05,320
These are highly specialized, displacable, replaceable, disposable things.

544
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,720
The big ones are a jack-of-all-trades kind of tool.

545
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:15,920
And we can see the rise after a quarter million years ago to about 105,000 years ago.

546
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:20,800
Suddenly, in the last Ice Age, we start to see lots of this obsidian,

547
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:27,480
which is coming from quite a distance, 60 to 100 kilometers from the archaeological sites,

548
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:34,800
shooting up to as much as 65% of the artifacts in the bottom of that section I just showed you.

549
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,960
That means a lot of interaction over long distances.

550
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:46,520
In South Africa, in that site where the volcanic ash was found at Pinnacle Point,

551
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:52,640
directly above the sand layer, we find the same kinds of blade segments,

552
00:46:52,640 --> 00:47:00,040
the disposable, sharp, easily replaceable, thin, fragile tools.

553
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:06,080
They're replacing these thick, robust tools that you could use for all kinds of circumstances.

554
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:12,320
I've made the argument that these are very effective because they're very sharp.

555
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,200
They're easy to replace.

556
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:19,160
You can make specialized toolkits, and you can bring along the right replacement parts

557
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:22,800
if you've planned out your day, your activities.

558
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:27,160
Neanderthals, Stephen Kuhn at the University of Arizona said,

559
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:30,200
their toolkits look like they were planning for the unanticipated,

560
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:37,760
planning for the unplanned, big tools that they could modify as needed when they encountered something.

561
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,400
So that's quite different.

562
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:45,600
Well, that's enough archaeology for now.

563
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,400
How do we survive?

564
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,120
Why did Neanderthals die out?

565
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,960
That's the real important question here.

566
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,320
I'm sorry.

567
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:01,280
I can't think of Neanderthals after looking at the totality of the evidence

568
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:07,520
that they were much different than Mad Max beyond Thunderdown.

569
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:13,840
Tina Turner, Mel Gibson, well, I won't say anything about Mel,

570
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:22,640
but he's got that kind of reactionary us against them kind of mentality.

571
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,880
So Neanderthals faced off to modern humans.

572
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:27,720
What was the advantage?

573
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:30,800
They're obviously a lot stronger than us.

574
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:41,040
I think that humans before Tova didn't have this long-distance transport

575
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:45,400
of the archaeological materials that show that they got outside of their home ranges

576
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,760
and came home again very often.

577
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,520
There's small amounts, but not a lot.

578
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:53,240
And I would say they were more cooperative afterwards.

579
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,680
Neanderthals never were.

580
00:48:54,680 --> 00:49:00,320
Last archaeological sites made by Neanderthals look like the one the quarter million years ago.

581
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:03,760
The archaeologists who work on these throw up their hands and say,

582
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,520
well, they just didn't change.

583
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,080
It didn't matter what the climate was.

584
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:13,560
And it must have been just the right thing, you know, like bacteria.

585
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:15,720
They've really worked it out.

586
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,720
They've got the all-purpose toolkit.

587
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:26,040
Now, I think that one of the most important things about modern people is

588
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,760
that they have these social relationships.

589
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:33,200
And they cement these ties with gifts and symbolic things.

590
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,920
I'm wearing some beads now that were a gift.

591
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:41,280
This woman is wearing her social capital, 25 Bushman exchange partners

592
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,960
that she's had for most of her life.

593
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:50,400
And this just is a marker that she has friends she's trusting.

594
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:55,800
She cooperates, she reciprocates, she gives as much as she receives.

595
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:59,680
These are the kinds of people you want in a tough environment

596
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,560
where you're all in the lifeboat.

597
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:02,960
This is really important.

598
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,320
We see she's wearing a lot of ostrich egg shell beads.

599
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,080
They go back 50,000 years.

600
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,520
I've dug up these.

601
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:13,640
They're older than 40,000 years old in the Kenya Rift Valley.

602
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:17,440
And these simple little things, they're really tiny.

603
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:21,240
That's a one-inch pin down there for scale.

604
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:24,960
May have been the first formal tokens.

605
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:29,120
I called them small things remembered.

606
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:32,840
Let's just move this over here.

607
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:36,840
And these people have these chains of relationships.

608
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:39,840
The attitude that lots of archaeologists have when they look

609
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:45,720
at the archaeological record is that it's always us versus them,

610
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,720
a zero-sum game.

611
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:48,640
But there's a new math.

612
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:56,920
If I give to you, it's not my loss.

613
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,160
I'm multiplying.

614
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:01,680
If two people cooperate, one person

615
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,880
may just be able to feed themself and their family maybe.

616
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,920
Two people, three people cooperating.

617
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:10,120
They can feed the whole camp.

618
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:15,000
So 1 plus 1 may equal 3, 4, or 5.

619
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,320
There's no negative in reciprocity.

620
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:21,280
But if you cheat, you may get shunned.

621
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:28,400
So rather than your gain is my loss,

622
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,920
we might want to think about Yates.

623
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,400
And I think this is a way they thought about the world, and they do.

624
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,840
They go out of their way to try to make new relationships with people.

625
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:40,640
Here, take this.

626
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:41,880
It's a gift.

627
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:44,120
I want you to have it.

628
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:48,600
This was told to me by Ed Wilmson, who worked among the Bushmen.

629
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:49,280
It's yours.

630
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,320
I want you to have it.

631
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,320
Don't you forget it.

632
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:59,480
So that's where we are.

633
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:03,560
I would argue that during the really tough times brought on

634
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:07,760
by this Toba eruption, especially the first 1,800 years,

635
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:12,400
people in Africa worked out systems of reciprocity, trust,

636
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,400
and cooperation that Neanderthals never did.

637
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,840
And with the cooperation sharing and exchange of information,

638
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:24,760
they could make those toolkits that look like the right tools for the job.

639
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:28,960
Neanderthals don't look like they had an information sharing-based use

640
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,280
of the landscape.

641
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,400
I call this a culturally constructed landscape.

642
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,960
They know where to go and what to do on the landscape because they've

643
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:41,600
got information that they've gotten shared through cultural mechanisms,

644
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:46,280
language, through friendships, their networks.

645
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:49,040
Neanderthals don't look like they had these networks.

646
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:54,280
They probably spoke in the imperative.

647
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:57,240
They didn't have these extended social landscapes.

648
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,320
If they left home, they were dinner.

649
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:06,560
So it looks like they developed the original social security system

650
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:11,520
as the best way I can describe it with reciprocal gift exchange.

651
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:15,080
So I'm pinning, based upon the archaeology,

652
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:20,240
where we see the hard evidence for extended social landscapes

653
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:25,200
in stone tools that have traveled further than the distance of the diameter

654
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:31,160
of 100 gatherers territory, even in the driest environments.

655
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:35,760
That's where I pin this troop to tribe transition.

656
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:40,720
So this also helps facilitate the exploitation of very risky habitats.

657
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:44,480
You can go out somewhere knowing you have a safety net to come back to.

658
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,600
If resources fail, you can move in with your friends.

659
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:52,320
A lot of this networking is about reciprocal rights of access

660
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:55,800
to each other's territories without getting shot.

661
00:53:55,800 --> 00:54:00,840
So this would also allow expansions out of Africa.

662
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:06,040
So the timing out of Africa, 60 to 50,000 years ago, fits with this.

663
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:09,960
They worked out the system.

664
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:12,480
They did all the R&D in Africa.

665
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,680
And what we think of is it was upper paleolithic mammoth hunters

666
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:20,280
and painters making beautiful blades and art, fancy tools.

667
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:25,040
Those things go back 30,000 years earlier in Africa.

668
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:33,880
So cooperative tribes could outcompete Neanderthal troops.

669
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:37,960
Now, I'm not sure if I have more time.

670
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:42,680
Christian, I could cut it off here.

671
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:48,520
And because what I'm going to do now would take you

672
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:52,200
in a completely different direction.

673
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,760
Is it all right?

674
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,800
All right, here we go.

675
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:00,240
The biology of cooperation.

676
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:06,920
I was stunned with the epiphany when I read a paper in Scientific American

677
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:15,000
in July 2008 about oxytocin, the love hormone, the trust hormone.

678
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:21,080
And that there are genes that underlie the susceptibility to the influence

679
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:23,320
of these pro and antisocial hormones.

680
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:25,560
And they vary among individuals.

681
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:30,280
And they're widespread throughout the animal kingdom, vertebrate animals.

682
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:33,440
And even invertebrates.

683
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,560
They are things like oxytocin.

684
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:42,280
Some variants of serotonin and vasopressin are more pro-social.

685
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:45,200
Testosterone is an antisocial one.

686
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:48,080
Fill her up with testosterone.

687
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,160
We know about that.

688
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:54,160
Each hormone system does have actually pro and antisocial variants.

689
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:58,240
Some people are totally resistant to the effects of oxytocin.

690
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:05,160
Others, I think that the used car salesmen might be spraying it around their offices.

691
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:07,200
Some people are suckers.

692
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:14,360
And you can, in the laboratory, make them more generous, more accepting of less

693
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:18,920
generous offers, more tolerant, and more likely to give.

694
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:21,160
Some don't do it at all.

695
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:24,720
Did Neanderthals have mainly antisocial variants of these hormones?

696
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:30,360
Were they more predominant prior to TOBA?

697
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:33,440
We'll see if we can figure this out.

698
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:38,760
Did frequencies of pro-social genes increase in Africans during the bottleneck?

699
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:41,480
The time when you need the most trust and cooperation?

700
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:44,880
If you were living in a very, very small population, I didn't tell you that

701
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:50,600
geneticists say that the genetic diversity of today could be accounted for by 5,000

702
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:55,440
breeding-aged females 70,000 years ago.

703
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:04,000
You could multiply that by six for parents, non-reproductive males and females, 60,000

704
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
people.

705
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:10,400
It is enough to account for the genetic diversity of the whole planet, a little bit higher now

706
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,720
because they keep measuring more genetic diversity in Africa.

707
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:15,840
Do hormones fossilize?

708
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:19,440
Well, I don't think so.

709
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:20,440
You never know.

710
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,040
Biochemistry is getting great.

711
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:28,480
I was hoping to get this by answer out of the genes in the fossil bones themselves, but

712
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:35,680
most fossil bones don't have genes, genetics preserved, genes preserved, but testosterone

713
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:42,400
seems to have some interesting skeletal effects and some of the other hormones do too.

714
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:49,200
We know this clinically that it will increase the jaw length and facial height of young

715
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:54,840
boys if you give them extra testosterone during puberty, if they're having delayed puberty.

716
00:57:54,840 --> 00:58:00,080
Orthodontists need to know this.

717
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:09,440
Jessamy Doman and Andrew Hill and colleagues at Yale presented this paper two years ago

718
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:17,040
at the Paleoanthropology Society, a new osteological approach to inferring social behavior, hominin

719
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:23,200
social behavior, facial indicators of testosterone level.

720
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:32,600
Indeed, there's a fossil trace of testosterone and they concluded that early Homo sapiens

721
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:41,120
and Homo neanderthalensis, so that's Homo sapiens earlier than 80,000, had elevated

722
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:47,120
levels of testosterone and maybe more male-male competition.

723
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:51,440
We know a lot about that.

724
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:57,760
High salivary testosterone is linked to masculine male facial appearance.

725
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:02,400
This is an Australian aborigine.

726
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:07,480
That's one of the most complete skeletons that was known in the early 1900s.

727
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:10,360
Marcel Boule put this together.

728
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:16,840
After learning about this face-shaped stuff, I started looking at these skulls in a very

729
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:21,480
different way as maybe the product of sexual selection.

730
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:24,120
Neanderthals have these big jutting faces.

731
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:25,720
This is a pre-Neanderthal.

732
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:30,520
Look at the third molar here, how far it's angled out.

733
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:34,880
It's as if they were trying to get that jaw out as far as they could.

734
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,000
It's amazing.

735
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,320
There's a big gap there.

736
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:41,400
We can't stick our finger behind our third molar.

737
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,640
The jaw ascending ramus is in the way.

738
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:50,680
They could stick a big, sharpie marker pen back there.

739
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:52,200
That's a big gap.

740
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,160
Why were those teeth getting pulled out?

741
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:56,600
Why was the jaw pulling out like that?

742
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:00,400
They had huge noses too, big nasal passages.

743
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,320
Well, how about voices?

744
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:07,160
This is a different way of looking at things.

745
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:11,440
The larynx can grow completely out of proportion to other body parts under the influence of

746
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:16,280
testosterone at puberty in human males.

747
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:21,160
Hypertrophied larynx of human males and their disproportionately low-pitched voices are

748
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:31,160
an adaptation to exaggerating body size, just like beards.

749
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:39,440
We use voices to assess physical strength and fighting ability, don't we?

750
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,800
I brought a heuristic device here.

751
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:49,640
With my grandchildren, I can give them a little scare if I go, I can give them shock and fright

752
01:00:49,640 --> 01:01:02,960
if I go, so you musicians know, tenor sax, alto, you name it, the bigger, the vocal tract,

753
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:08,720
the super pharyngeal vocal tract, the deeper your voice.

754
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:13,440
So there's a modern human and luscious pell again.

755
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:18,840
If we keep the hyoid in the same position, that's what holds your voice box, then the

756
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:23,400
distance to wherever the lips might be out here would be quite large.

757
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:34,560
Now, we know this, that people with big lower faces have deep voices, Barry White.

758
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:39,440
And Ron Perlman, his first big role was the Neanderthal Inquest for Fire.

759
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:42,880
He has a really deep voice.

760
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,440
I was in, let's see, where was this?

761
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:46,440
This is Beijing.

762
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:53,800
I think, yes, that was in the Beijing Museum, across from Tiananmen Square in, just Christmas,

763
01:01:53,800 --> 01:02:01,520
actually, and I just, just struck by the, the fighter, it's a full-size ceramic tricolor

764
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:07,640
statue, three-glazed statue of a fighter, and I thought, well, yeah, he looks like a

765
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:08,640
fighter.

766
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:09,840
Look at that jaw.

767
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:14,320
And if you go into all the Buddhist shrines and temples, you will see that the Buddha

768
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:19,480
is surrounded by guys with these huge lower faces and big brow ridges, even though he

769
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:23,480
has a real baby face.

770
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:24,840
They're protecting him.

771
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:32,240
Now, the last part of hormones, testosterone responses are related to facial masculinity

772
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:40,760
for competition, testosterone administration decreases generosity, okay, but oxytocin

773
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:43,280
increases trust.

774
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:49,360
Now, Professor Rangham, I think he had to leave here, he's part of this research group

775
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:57,480
and Peter Ellison as well, and most of the people on this list are just upstairs here.

776
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:03,720
Among chimpanzees, testosterone levels increase markedly during adolescence.

777
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:06,280
This is a common chimpanzee.

778
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:15,240
The bonobo, which is the, I suppose you could call them the free love hippie chimpanzees,

779
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:16,240
do not change.

780
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:20,360
Now, let's just do a little comparison here.

781
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:26,960
Bonobos, I'm calling them tribes because of the last point on this list.

782
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:31,160
Females are dominant, they have low sexual dimorphism, there's not a lot of difference

783
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:34,640
between males and females.

784
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:41,400
Females are very rare, intergroup counters are amazing, they're peaceful, they party.

785
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:50,120
The males get kind of like, but then they say, I give up, and they come together peacefully

786
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:56,800
and then they go on their separate ways, feeling good.

787
01:03:56,800 --> 01:04:04,400
Sea troops, Professor Rangham here is well documented, lots of aspects of their male

788
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:07,080
aggression, he's written a whole book about it.

789
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:12,360
They have high sexual dimorphism, big canines compared to the females.

790
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:17,160
They are highly aggressive and they have these intergroup encounters that are violent and

791
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:18,160
often deadly.

792
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:24,520
A group of males will go off and patrol, they'll sit and listen, see if they can find a lone

793
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:30,520
male and then they'll kill him.

794
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:36,560
The last piece of the puzzle was published last summer, 2014.

795
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:40,760
This is supposed to be an anatomically modern human, sometimes I wasn't sure if they were

796
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:42,760
Neanderthals.

797
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:48,160
Very rugged, they're older than 80,000, at places like Shkuhul and Kafsa Cave in Israel.

798
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:51,480
Here's a post 80,000 year old skeleton.

799
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:57,400
Most of the, all the humans younger than 80,000 are much less robust.

800
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:03,320
Something happened around that time of Toba.

801
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:13,400
The hypothesis I proposed in 2010 that Toba was a strong selective force for killing off

802
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:19,720
anti-social people among the Africans in those harsh environments is quite consistent with

803
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:20,720
this.

804
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:25,200
So that's my hypothesis.

805
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,040
So here we are.

806
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:35,600
It's not just charisma, image and sarcasm, against more basic instincts.

807
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:38,440
I think Neanderthals spoke in the imperative.

808
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:41,120
Okay, you can fill in the caption here.

809
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:45,320
Maybe you remember this episode of Star Trek.

810
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:51,600
Kirk and his crew are captives in the Klingon ship.

811
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:57,800
And Kirk looks at him and he says, what do you think he's saying to the Klingon commander

812
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:00,720
that's going to get them out of there?

813
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:06,880
He says something to the effect.

814
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:12,360
And he turns around and he snarls at his command, his second in command.

815
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:16,760
And they start fighting amongst themselves like a big bar fight.

816
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:22,680
And these guys just steal away and go, beam me up, Scotty.

817
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:26,680
Short tempered.

818
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:36,240
Now, catastrophic theories usually put you on the fringe.

819
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:42,320
I don't have a Nobel Prize to promote something that is now widely accepted but has taken

820
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:47,840
40 years and there's still holdouts that the asteroid that hit the Yucatan Peninsula

821
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:53,360
65,000 years ago wasn't responsible for big change.

822
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:58,240
So if that asteroid didn't happen, where would we be now?

823
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:01,840
We'd be scurrying around in the underbrush and up in the tips of trees, watching out

824
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:05,640
for those snapping jaws.

825
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:13,840
So we could make the same question about what happened 73,880 years ago.

826
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:21,040
Would we still be more like primate troops than human tribes?

827
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:27,200
That's a hard question to answer because we have lots of evidence of some artistic creativity

828
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,560
before 80,000 years ago.

829
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:39,280
But creativity and art and pro-sociality, that's not a perfect one-to-one correlation,

830
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,080
so to speak.

831
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:44,880
Anyways, that's my story and I'm sticking with it.
