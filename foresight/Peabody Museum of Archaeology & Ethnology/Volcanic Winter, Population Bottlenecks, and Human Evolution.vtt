WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.840
Thanks very much.

00:08.840 --> 00:14.160
Archeology is not just about unearthing artifacts, it's sometimes about unearthing new information,

00:14.160 --> 00:17.200
new photographs, new images in the archives, and these are just sort of a fun series of

00:17.200 --> 00:22.120
photographs that I recently came across in the archives in the Bannoncroft Library at

00:22.120 --> 00:26.160
University of California Berkeley, including my favorite Moevious on his first camel.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.760
I don't know if you can work out the caption there in the lower side.

00:29.720 --> 00:34.560
Some nice work that he was doing as a graduate student in the early 1930s at a site in Israel

00:34.560 --> 00:37.280
called Mugaret S. School.

00:37.280 --> 00:41.960
So as you've heard tonight is the annual Halamel Moevious Junior Lecturer.

00:41.960 --> 00:45.440
Professor Moevious was a distinguished scholar, a curator and archaeologist here at Harvard

00:45.440 --> 00:46.960
University.

00:46.960 --> 00:50.680
He was really internationally recognized as a paleolithic archaeologist, but he did

00:50.680 --> 00:51.680
a wide range of things.

00:51.680 --> 00:52.680
This is really important.

00:52.680 --> 00:56.960
His work ranged from the Irish Mesolithic to the sort of East Asian Lower Paleolithic

00:57.000 --> 01:01.880
and probably most famously upper paleolithic sites such as Avery Patot in southwestern

01:01.880 --> 01:03.400
France.

01:03.400 --> 01:07.880
Importantly, with his appointment here in 1939 as curator in the Peabody and then later

01:07.880 --> 01:12.480
in appointment as a lecturer in the Department of Anthropology in 1948, he was the first

01:12.480 --> 01:15.880
paleolithic archaeologist working at Harvard.

01:15.880 --> 01:22.480
So there's a tie-in here in that the point of me being up here is to introduce tonight's

01:22.480 --> 01:25.600
speaker Dr. Stanley Ambrose, which I'm very happy to do.

01:25.640 --> 01:27.480
The tie-in is twofold.

01:27.480 --> 01:33.680
One, as I just learned, Stan is actually from the same hometown as Professor Moevious, Newton,

01:33.680 --> 01:39.280
right here, attended UMass Boston as an undergraduate, but he was also received as PhD in 1984 at

01:39.280 --> 01:44.000
the University of California, Berkeley, under Dr. Glenn Isaac, who then came here in 1983

01:44.000 --> 01:47.840
as the second paleolithic archaeologist after Dr. Moevious's retirement.

01:47.840 --> 01:49.640
So there's a nice tie-in there.

01:49.640 --> 01:54.440
The other tie-in is that I think like Dr. Moevious and like the sort of mission of the

01:54.440 --> 01:58.880
Harvard Museum of Science and Culture, Dr. Ambrose's research and his research interest

01:58.880 --> 02:03.080
really cut across a wide range of different time periods.

02:03.080 --> 02:07.600
It involves work from a wide diversity of different geographic locations, and it really

02:07.600 --> 02:11.640
embraces a sort of natural science approach to figuring out the past, not just archaeology,

02:11.640 --> 02:17.720
but really embracing a wide variety of different ways of thinking about reconstructing the human

02:17.720 --> 02:20.680
past and the environment in which early humans lived.

02:20.680 --> 02:25.400
So tonight, one part of this, as you'll hear, Professor Ambrose will be discussing the archeological

02:25.400 --> 02:30.960
evidence for the impact of enormous volcanic eruption at Mount Toba about 74,000 years

02:30.960 --> 02:34.680
ago and how this might have impacted human populations.

02:34.680 --> 02:39.560
But what I want you to get a sense of is this is just one small part of what he does.

02:39.560 --> 02:44.040
Really Dr. Ambrose's research interest range from everything from African archaeology from

02:44.040 --> 02:48.040
the Iron Age to quite recent periods to the sort of deepest early Stone Age.

02:48.040 --> 02:52.880
He's done work on Miocene apes, interests in the study of modern human origins more

02:52.880 --> 02:59.120
broadly, paleoecology, human diet, using isotopes in particular, looking at sites from China,

02:59.120 --> 03:02.720
Kenya, stone tool analysis, language, the evolution of cooperation.

03:02.720 --> 03:06.880
The list really does go on for quite some time.

03:06.880 --> 03:10.840
Looking at these topics, answering these questions have taken him to field sites in

03:10.840 --> 03:16.640
Kenya, Ethiopia, India, and Australia, and I'm sure other places as we might learn.

03:16.640 --> 03:20.080
His work has been published widely in things such as the Journal of Archaeological Science

03:20.080 --> 03:21.080
or Nature.

03:21.080 --> 03:24.160
He's published a number of co-authored books as well.

03:24.160 --> 03:27.680
And perhaps not surprisingly, his research has been well funded by the National Science

03:27.680 --> 03:33.920
Foundation in particular, recognizing his repeated innovative research projects.

03:33.920 --> 03:37.360
So the list of accomplishments could go on for quite some time.

03:37.360 --> 03:40.640
But I'd like to notice sort of a personal note that I've known Stan for about 15 years

03:40.640 --> 03:41.640
now.

03:41.640 --> 03:45.440
And during that time, I've often drawn on his sort of encyclopedic knowledge and I think

03:45.440 --> 03:48.680
a particularly good skill of knowing a good idea from a bad idea.

03:48.680 --> 03:51.960
And he's helped me sort of pursue the good ideas and not the bad ones quite often in

03:51.960 --> 03:52.960
the past.

03:52.960 --> 03:53.960
For that, I thank him.

03:53.960 --> 03:56.600
So with that, please join me in welcoming Dr. Stanley Ambrose.

03:56.600 --> 04:10.040
Well, thank you, Christian, for that generous introduction.

04:10.040 --> 04:11.800
I don't know if I deserve all of it.

04:11.800 --> 04:14.560
I hope my voice carries.

04:14.560 --> 04:17.520
I've got a bit of a rough throat.

04:17.520 --> 04:20.080
I should open up this water bottle.

04:20.080 --> 04:31.040
Thank you all for coming and especially Professor Moevious's children here.

04:31.040 --> 04:36.480
I never got to meet Professor Moevious, but I feel like I should know him.

04:36.480 --> 04:42.040
I mention him in almost every class I teach.

04:42.040 --> 04:47.720
And he's on my exams.

04:47.720 --> 04:57.800
And well, there'll be no exam after tonight's talk, but I'm going to move widely.

04:57.800 --> 05:05.200
I was looking at something that he wrote in 1948 and he actually mentions the volcanic

05:05.200 --> 05:08.680
ash from the eruption that I'll be talking about tonight.

05:08.680 --> 05:16.320
So this is something that was well known.

05:16.320 --> 05:18.080
Can everybody hear me all right?

05:18.080 --> 05:20.560
Okay, good.

05:20.560 --> 05:21.920
Let's see where we're going.

05:21.920 --> 05:30.600
Well, first of all, Kano in winter in erupting, this is up in the Kamchatka Peninsula.

05:30.600 --> 05:38.440
And I'm going to talk about a much larger eruption than this and how it affected population

05:38.440 --> 05:43.800
history and I'll try to explain to you how we go about identifying population history

05:43.800 --> 05:50.560
from the genes and how the consequences of this eruption may have changed the environment

05:50.560 --> 05:58.960
in ways that favored a new pathway, a new direction in human evolution.

05:58.960 --> 06:05.480
And I like to call this new direction the troop to tribe transition.

06:05.480 --> 06:15.360
I'd like to just define troops and tribes for you in the way that fits my real interests.

06:15.360 --> 06:20.560
A lot of people around the world are very interested in the evolution of cooperation.

06:20.560 --> 06:27.920
There are people on Harvard University campus writing books about how evolution favors cooperation.

06:27.920 --> 06:31.720
I would disagree that it always favors cooperation.

06:31.720 --> 06:36.280
We know about competition, there's a lot of writing about competition.

06:36.280 --> 06:41.040
If we think about most of our primate relatives, they live in what we call troops that live

06:41.040 --> 06:42.920
in closed territories.

06:42.920 --> 06:48.620
They may have tightly knit cooperative, sometimes not so cooperative relationships within their

06:48.620 --> 06:54.200
troop and on a regular basis they go to the boundaries of their territories and they make

06:54.200 --> 07:01.480
noises and in the case of chimpanzees, they may actually look for lone troop members from

07:01.480 --> 07:04.680
the adjacent troop and try to kill them.

07:04.680 --> 07:09.360
Richard Rangham has written extensively about this, Professor Rangham here in the Anthropology

07:09.360 --> 07:10.720
Department.

07:10.720 --> 07:17.520
So the question is, to what extent did we have in our past a troop-like kind of organization

07:17.520 --> 07:21.200
and when did we really break out of it?

07:21.200 --> 07:24.920
We may not have broken out of it entirely.

07:24.920 --> 07:31.880
So small, closed, defended territories is what I think of as troops.

07:31.880 --> 07:38.400
Human tribes have regional networks of communities that people visit, they have relationships

07:38.400 --> 07:43.200
between them, they can go out and visit and they can come home again.

07:43.200 --> 07:48.560
Most primates are on a one-way trip and I'll talk about one exception later.

07:48.560 --> 07:50.680
We have positive relationships.

07:50.680 --> 07:56.120
We have names for people in other groups, sometimes they're fictional names.

07:56.120 --> 08:02.000
We can talk about brothers in arms and these are important human innovation to be able

08:02.000 --> 08:08.440
to make a symbolic name for something and then behave as if they are your brother or

08:08.440 --> 08:12.840
your sister or your uncle, so forth.

08:12.840 --> 08:18.920
Now modern hunter-gatherers in arid and risky environments tend to have the greatest extent

08:18.960 --> 08:23.840
of their social networks.

08:23.840 --> 08:28.600
This could contrast with some agricultural communities, many of them who live in very

08:28.600 --> 08:36.960
stable environments, do you think of the Yanamamo in South American forests or Papua New Guinea?

08:36.960 --> 08:43.400
To call them tribes is being contested by John Yellen and Henry Harpending who are also

08:43.400 --> 08:49.560
of Harvard University here and they wrote about this in World Archaeology.

08:49.560 --> 08:54.920
They didn't use the troop to try distinction, it's very hard to actually find mention of

08:54.920 --> 08:59.560
this in the literature, but when we teach our anthropology courses and evolution courses

08:59.560 --> 09:04.920
we always talk about primate troops and then we talk about two and a half million year

09:04.920 --> 09:10.120
old stone tool using meat-eating groups.

09:10.120 --> 09:18.500
To what extent did they have an intergroup favorable reciprocal relationships?

09:18.500 --> 09:24.080
This question came to me in the middle of a lecture and then I realized that maybe it

09:24.080 --> 09:30.320
wasn't as far back in time as we would necessarily assume.

09:30.320 --> 09:35.840
So let's talk about volcanoes and a little bit of art.

09:35.840 --> 09:43.120
This is Turner, I haven't seen the movie yet, I don't think it got any Oscars.

09:43.120 --> 09:52.640
But in 1815, Tambora erupted in between Java and Sumatra, I think it was, and the skies

09:52.640 --> 09:59.160
turned gloomy for several years, 1816 was a year without a summer.

09:59.160 --> 10:06.120
These amazing sunsets and the atmospherics were incredible, it looks like Beijing where

10:06.120 --> 10:14.840
I was about two months ago in the bottom one, pretty thick air.

10:14.840 --> 10:23.800
A lot of things happened in that summer and Lord Byron with his guests at his summer home

10:23.800 --> 10:30.360
on the shores of Lake Geneva wrote, this is just a little excerpt from his poem, the bright

10:30.360 --> 10:35.720
sun was extinguished and the stars did wander, darkling in the eternal space, I won't read

10:35.720 --> 10:40.880
the whole thing, it goes quite a long time and it gets more dismal and there's death

10:40.880 --> 10:41.880
in it.

10:41.880 --> 10:51.360
And one of his house guests was Mary Shelley and Mary Shelley created this story then.

10:51.360 --> 10:57.800
I won't attribute it entirely to the volcano.

10:57.800 --> 11:05.680
This is what happens to the atmosphere when a large low latitude, high explosive eruption

11:05.680 --> 11:10.320
occurs that has a lot of sulfur gases in the mix.

11:10.320 --> 11:17.760
This was Pinatubo and you can see the distribution of the sulfur gas as it went around the world

11:17.760 --> 11:18.960
over 12 weeks.

11:18.960 --> 11:28.600
It was the largest sulfur exhalation and it went up about 20 miles into the stratosphere

11:28.600 --> 11:37.920
and spread around the world for a couple of years at least, there was a one degree temperature

11:37.920 --> 11:46.200
drop, Tambora was quite a bit more severe with a larger eruption.

11:46.200 --> 11:54.960
Now I got involved with this when I saw this paper that was published in Nature in 1992

11:54.960 --> 12:06.640
by Michael Rampino and Steven Self and they proposed that the eruption of Toba in Sumatra,

12:06.640 --> 12:13.960
73, 74,000 years ago, it's the largest crater lake in the world right now, produced enough

12:14.960 --> 12:20.840
sulfuric acid that was in the stratosphere to reflect sunlight for five to six years

12:20.840 --> 12:25.920
and cause a volcanic winter just like the nuclear winter scenarios that were popular

12:25.920 --> 12:31.320
in the 80s and they're still being modeled and considered.

12:31.320 --> 12:37.880
Billions of tons of sulfur were ejected into the stratosphere according to them and it

12:37.880 --> 12:45.320
may have initiated the last glacial era at 70,000 years ago.

12:45.320 --> 12:51.600
The climate records were not very detailed then but that was the idea.

12:51.600 --> 12:57.560
They become much more detailed and we'll look at some of them and the volcanic ash was found,

12:57.560 --> 13:03.640
here's Toba down here, volcanic ash was found halfway across the Indian Ocean.

13:03.640 --> 13:07.280
One of my mentors at Berkeley in grad school was Desmond Clark.

13:07.280 --> 13:14.400
He went to India in 1980 and 81, 82 with a little team when they couldn't go to Ethiopia

13:14.400 --> 13:21.520
to find early hominids and early archaeological sites and Martin Williams, who I've worked

13:21.520 --> 13:30.440
with in India and in Kenya and in Australia now, found a volcanic ash layer halfway across

13:30.440 --> 13:37.280
India and it turned out to correlate and it looks like India was covered with at least

13:37.280 --> 13:40.200
10 centimeters of volcanic ash.

13:40.200 --> 13:44.240
We'll talk a little bit more about that later.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.000
How big was the eruption?

13:46.000 --> 13:52.480
The eruption happened new date 73,880 years ago.

13:52.480 --> 13:54.960
That's a nice date.

13:54.960 --> 14:01.760
When I saw the talk that this table came from, I was about to fall asleep and then I saw

14:01.760 --> 14:06.800
that Toba produced 800 cubic kilometers.

14:06.800 --> 14:15.800
The estimate was in 1990, 1992, 800 cubic kilometers of rock blasted into the atmosphere

14:15.800 --> 14:21.520
and the total eruptive volume has been estimated to be 2,700 cubic kilometers.

14:21.520 --> 14:23.880
That's a lot.

14:23.880 --> 14:31.960
So that was in 1992 and by the year 2002, the ash had been found, I think, out into

14:31.960 --> 14:36.400
the Arabian Sea.

14:36.400 --> 14:42.400
So it was getting bigger as more research was being done.

14:42.400 --> 14:46.480
There's Yellowstone at about the same scale for comparison.

14:46.480 --> 14:50.240
The eruptions, the super eruptions from Yellowstone.

14:50.240 --> 14:55.760
Now by 2008, they started thinking it was even bigger and you can see Pinatubo's ash

14:55.760 --> 15:01.720
fall area and Tambora the year without a summer.

15:01.720 --> 15:04.960
That looks pretty big.

15:04.960 --> 15:12.920
In 2012, ash was discovered and chemically fingerprinted fairly precisely.

15:12.920 --> 15:18.360
In two cores drilled into the muds in the bottom of Lake Malawi.

15:18.400 --> 15:23.720
That gets us to about 21 million kilometers square and probably closer to 2,000 cubic

15:23.720 --> 15:27.160
kilometers of a dense rock equivalent.

15:27.160 --> 15:32.000
Even out here in the Indian Ocean, about the same distance as across the United States,

15:32.000 --> 15:34.760
it was up to 34 centimeters thick.

15:34.760 --> 15:39.440
That's a little bit more than a foot thick, 14 inches.

15:39.440 --> 15:40.440
That's amazing.

15:40.440 --> 15:45.360
The Yellowstone ash has never been found east of the Mississippi despite the prevailing

15:45.360 --> 15:47.320
winds.

15:48.080 --> 15:50.200
It's getting bigger.

15:50.200 --> 15:58.520
In April last year, it was reported all the way down there in the south coast of South

15:58.520 --> 16:00.520
Africa.

16:00.520 --> 16:08.640
Near the bottom of a sand layer that occurs for maybe 100 miles along the coast.

16:08.640 --> 16:13.600
This wind-blown sand layer seems to represent an interesting climatic event.

16:13.600 --> 16:20.440
I'll come back to the cultural changes that seem to be marked by this sand layer.

16:20.440 --> 16:24.720
The search is now really on for finding this ash just about everywhere.

16:24.720 --> 16:32.520
It's hard to find it because it's little individual cryptic shards of glass.

16:32.520 --> 16:35.680
But there's no volcanoes in South Africa.

16:35.680 --> 16:41.360
They can be chemically fingerprinted with microscopic techniques.

16:41.440 --> 16:46.920
Here's the, this is called the two-mile time machine.

16:46.920 --> 16:54.080
Every core that's drilled into the ice in the Arctic can go down about two miles before

16:54.080 --> 16:59.840
the ice gets very deformed and you lose a detailed climate record.

16:59.840 --> 17:02.280
But you can get annual layering.

17:02.280 --> 17:04.240
This is the second mile down.

17:04.240 --> 17:08.520
The first mile covers 10,000 years of a Greenland ice core.

17:08.520 --> 17:16.440
Second mile covers 110,000, 120,000 years.

17:16.440 --> 17:22.840
When the curve goes down, we're looking at low oxygen isotope ratios.

17:22.840 --> 17:23.840
That's cold.

17:23.840 --> 17:26.760
When it goes up, we're looking at warm.

17:26.760 --> 17:31.280
The last 10,000 years, 12,000 years is just at the top of the graph and it stays that

17:31.280 --> 17:32.840
way to the present.

17:32.840 --> 17:38.440
A warm wet period where ice is accumulated rapidly.

17:39.440 --> 17:46.480
What's interesting is that Toba produced enough sulfuric acid to leave a very large

17:46.480 --> 17:54.920
patch of a very acidic ice, sulfuric acid, haze that finally precipitated out.

17:54.920 --> 17:57.800
And it was already in an ice age.

17:57.800 --> 18:05.600
So we can get a simple answer to Rampino and Self's question, did it cause the last

18:05.600 --> 18:06.600
ice age?

18:06.720 --> 18:09.920
The last ice age was pretty much all the way there.

18:09.920 --> 18:13.600
However, it went a little further.

18:13.600 --> 18:22.200
So these ups and downs, pairs of them are called Greenland events and there, the S stands

18:22.200 --> 18:24.080
for stadial.

18:24.080 --> 18:27.360
There's a little I there that stands for interstadial.

18:27.360 --> 18:31.280
The I's are warm, the S's are cold.

18:31.280 --> 18:33.400
So that's the interstadial, stadial.

18:33.400 --> 18:35.680
And that was stadial 20.

18:35.680 --> 18:42.800
Now it definitely did not cause the last ice age because after 1800 years of the coldest,

18:42.800 --> 18:50.720
temperatures recorded in 123,000 years worth of ice, it got abruptly warm, 16 degrees Celsius,

18:50.720 --> 18:54.880
that's about 27 degrees Fahrenheit, increase in warmth.

18:54.880 --> 19:02.320
So again, this eruption may have done something to exacerbate the cold here, make it the coldest

19:02.320 --> 19:08.280
of one of these instant ice ages, and that's what I call them, lasted 1800 years, but didn't

19:08.280 --> 19:09.960
cause the last ice age.

19:09.960 --> 19:17.600
Last ice age then came, and it's from about 70,000 to 60,000 years ago.

19:17.600 --> 19:25.240
That's a long time for almost unrelenting cold, a few little blips of warm, and that's

19:25.240 --> 19:29.840
the last glacial maximum as it's commonly known when the mammoth hunters were killing

19:29.840 --> 19:31.720
off the last of the woolly mammoths.

19:32.160 --> 19:38.800
It was colder, it was a tough time, and the people weren't as technologically sophisticated

19:38.800 --> 19:42.880
or so we may think back then.

19:42.880 --> 19:49.120
So I call that marine isotope, I don't call that, it's been called marine isotope stage 4.

19:49.120 --> 19:56.000
This is marine isotope stage 5, a predominantly warm and wet period.

19:56.000 --> 20:01.760
But this is the flickering switch of last glacial climate.

20:01.760 --> 20:09.360
This is a stage of predominantly cold, stage 3 is predominantly warm, stage 2 sort of dips

20:09.360 --> 20:15.640
down into what we call the last glacial maximum, and then the last 10,000 years is warm.

20:15.640 --> 20:28.240
So Toba erupted after the onset of one of these instant ice ages, and you could argue

20:28.240 --> 20:32.640
that it made it the coldest and stayed cold.

20:32.640 --> 20:39.080
So if we look in detail at it, we can see the sulfur in centimeter by centimeter of

20:39.080 --> 20:53.760
the ice at a depth of about 2,591.05 meters, that's about two miles down.

20:53.760 --> 20:59.160
And that's the most sulfur in the core, so whoops, going backwards.

20:59.160 --> 21:03.800
I thought this was an arrow pointing to where the sulfur spike was, but it's actually the

21:03.800 --> 21:08.760
height of the sulfur spike, and it's six years wide.

21:08.760 --> 21:11.360
And there's more later.

21:11.360 --> 21:19.280
Dust increases dramatically as well during this 1,800 year period, and then dust drops

21:19.280 --> 21:27.320
away when that warm period comes, interstitial 19, and then we go for 10,000 years of that

21:27.320 --> 21:34.360
very cold period with lots more dust, very little vegetation to hold the soil down, very

21:34.360 --> 21:37.360
cold at that time.

21:37.360 --> 21:39.760
This is just a bit of a detail on it.

21:39.760 --> 21:46.920
So this is just to emphasize that the eruption didn't cause a cold period, but I think it

21:46.920 --> 21:50.480
may have exacerbated it.

21:50.480 --> 21:54.160
Now I've done some research in India, as I mentioned.

21:54.160 --> 22:03.200
This is the Saan River, Narmada, and that's near Rajasthan, volcanic ash has been found

22:03.200 --> 22:08.280
in many, many more places than this, but these are places that I've done work on the volcanic

22:08.280 --> 22:09.280
ash.

22:09.280 --> 22:16.520
This is where Toba is, and I'll just show you a few of these places.

22:16.520 --> 22:21.360
This is the type site where Martin Williams, with his grad student, Royce, they came upon

22:21.360 --> 22:28.200
that pale layer there, and Martin said to Royce, if this was Ethiopia, that would be

22:28.200 --> 22:29.640
a volcanic ash.

22:29.640 --> 22:33.480
I'd better take a double sample, and he did.

22:33.480 --> 22:42.960
Then we came back when I developed my specialty of analyzing soils, and we cleared off a nice

22:42.960 --> 22:46.080
section and sampled.

22:46.080 --> 22:55.480
That's Parth Chauhan, and part of our team there, and I'm working with him elsewhere.

22:55.480 --> 22:57.680
He's at about the top of the volcanic ash.

22:57.680 --> 23:04.440
It's a little bit brown here, a little bit upriver.

23:04.440 --> 23:11.800
The ash actually is pretty pure down to the bottom, gets reworked, and the soil is ashy

23:11.800 --> 23:13.480
all the way up to there.

23:13.480 --> 23:17.880
That's my behind.

23:17.880 --> 23:20.920
Sampling the soils for analysis.

23:20.920 --> 23:22.880
There's a close up of the ash.

23:22.880 --> 23:29.720
It's bright white, 10 centimeters across India, and probably elsewhere.

23:29.720 --> 23:35.200
You know what happens when bright white stuff falls on the ground around here?

23:35.200 --> 23:37.820
This doesn't melt.

23:37.820 --> 23:39.080
It reflects sunlight.

23:39.080 --> 23:40.680
That's called albedo.

23:40.680 --> 23:43.160
It's reflectance.

23:43.160 --> 23:45.680
Ice and snow have high reflectance.

23:45.680 --> 23:52.120
This bright white ash could have helped the cooling.

23:52.120 --> 23:59.120
The aerosol, parasol gas, so to speak, the fine mist that was ejected, the sulfuric

23:59.120 --> 24:04.560
acid is white, makes a white haze that is an effective reflector of sunlight.

24:04.560 --> 24:09.080
That's why big volcanic eruptions cause global cooling.

24:09.080 --> 24:13.440
They have to be low latitudes because that's where most of the sunlight falls to really

24:13.440 --> 24:16.600
have an impact.

24:16.600 --> 24:20.280
October was low latitude.

24:20.280 --> 24:25.600
Chemical fingerprint was distinctive and identified all over the place.

24:25.600 --> 24:34.040
One of the things I do is I analyze the carbon in soils, not the carbon-14, the carbon-13,

24:34.040 --> 24:42.520
which is not radioactive, and it's ratioed to the common carbon, carbon-12.

24:42.520 --> 24:49.880
Here has given us a nice natural label, like a tracer that, in biomedicine, they'd give

24:49.880 --> 24:51.360
you a radioactive tracer.

24:51.360 --> 24:55.040
There's a natural tracer.

24:55.040 --> 24:58.960
These are low 13C content plants.

24:58.960 --> 25:05.560
They include trees and shrubs and rice and wheat and potatoes and non-tropical grasses.

25:05.560 --> 25:10.680
These are called C4 plants, and they have much higher carbon-13 content, and there's

25:10.680 --> 25:18.440
nothing in between, and they are mainly tropical grasses.

25:18.440 --> 25:25.960
If we have a warm forest in the tropics and it's wet, we get 13C values of the soil that

25:25.960 --> 25:27.480
look like this.

25:27.480 --> 25:34.160
If it's a dry open grassland, we get 13C values that look like this in the organic carbon.

25:34.160 --> 25:38.720
Calcium carbonate, the same stuff that chalk and limestone is made out of, forms in the

25:38.720 --> 25:43.960
soil, and it also acquires the carbon isotope ratios of the plants.

25:43.960 --> 25:54.480
That is offset by 14, so we can move the numbers here to be 14 for 100% woody plants, herbs,

25:54.480 --> 26:02.280
trees, forest, and somewhere around zero to a little bit more for grasses.

26:02.280 --> 26:08.280
I've done some analyses at three sites, and these are three separate sites in their graphs.

26:08.320 --> 26:15.600
I've shown you these two, and that's 500 centimeters above the base of the ash, and then it goes

26:15.600 --> 26:22.560
down to about 200 centimeters below the ash.

26:22.560 --> 26:27.040
Each of these graphs goes from trees to grass.

26:27.040 --> 26:33.720
Let's see if I've got that labeled here.

26:33.720 --> 26:34.720
There we are.

26:34.720 --> 26:39.880
These are all of the sites where we excavated and sampled soils.

26:39.880 --> 26:45.680
The carbon isotope ratio of the soils underneath the ash showed forest.

26:45.680 --> 26:49.920
One exception, that one bit.

26:49.920 --> 26:55.800
Inside the ash and near the top of the ash, whoops, going the wrong way.

26:55.800 --> 26:56.800
This helps.

26:56.800 --> 27:02.320
13C values shifted up with more grass.

27:02.320 --> 27:11.960
This really long section stayed with lots of grass for a considerable time, maybe 2,000

27:11.960 --> 27:12.960
years.

27:12.960 --> 27:15.200
We don't know exactly.

27:15.200 --> 27:21.520
Soils above the ash supported C4, grassy woodland to grassland.

27:21.520 --> 27:31.440
Put simply, the eruption fell on a very forested landscape, over 400 kilometers that we sampled,

27:32.240 --> 27:36.040
and after the eruption, there was grassland.

27:36.040 --> 27:40.560
Central India was deforested by the Toba eruption.

27:40.560 --> 27:44.520
Now, what are some of the broader impacts?

27:44.520 --> 27:54.200
We can go to the fossil record closer to Toba, Southeast Asia, and Lois has identified about

27:54.200 --> 28:00.760
11 or 12 large mammal extinctions, either total extinctions or regional extinctions.

28:00.760 --> 28:06.760
What really is interesting to me is that orangutans used to live on mainland Southeast Asia.

28:06.760 --> 28:11.560
Their last appearance date is somewhere around the time of Toba.

28:11.560 --> 28:14.600
Orangutans really don't do well on the ground.

28:14.600 --> 28:23.560
They have four arms, they don't really have legs, and that's just one of the species.

28:23.560 --> 28:26.960
He says it's not significant.

28:26.960 --> 28:30.120
That's 12 more extinctions than I've ever said happened.

28:30.120 --> 28:34.560
Now, let's switch from the paleontology and talk about genetics.

28:34.560 --> 28:41.360
As long ago as 1972, the geneticists studying the patterns of genetic diversity observed

28:41.360 --> 28:49.640
that there wasn't enough genetic diversity in humans alive today to account for the amount

28:49.640 --> 28:53.320
of time we've had a fossil record of humanity.

28:53.320 --> 28:59.200
And John Hay and John Maynard Smith proposed that about five times the age of the origins

28:59.200 --> 29:04.440
of agriculture, which gets us to about 60,000 to 70,000 years old, there was a long period

29:04.440 --> 29:10.440
of very low population size where much of the genetic diversity was lost.

29:10.440 --> 29:15.160
And there have been a small number of mutations accumulating since that period that differentiate

29:15.160 --> 29:16.160
people.

29:16.160 --> 29:24.000
But most of the mutations that we should see, the genetic diversity we should see, is missing.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
So that was a mystery.

29:25.000 --> 29:28.040
It goes all the way back to 1972.

29:28.040 --> 29:33.080
So this just happens to be a period from when Toba, all the way up through marine isotope

29:33.080 --> 29:39.200
stage four, that early glacial maximum, they didn't know anything about this.

29:39.200 --> 29:46.720
Now, this is how geneticists just pretend I'm a tree, okay?

29:46.720 --> 29:51.760
I had to give a talk once where I had no graphics and I just, you know, nothing to show on.

29:51.760 --> 29:55.720
And I said, well, just pretend, imagine I'm a tree.

29:55.720 --> 29:57.480
This is a tree that's growing.

29:57.480 --> 29:59.720
It's not lost any branches.

29:59.720 --> 30:04.440
And the lineages, so to speak, each branch has survived for a very long time.

30:04.440 --> 30:09.520
So to get back to the common ancestor of this tips of the branches and those tips of the

30:09.520 --> 30:11.720
branches, you have to go way down to the trunk.

30:11.720 --> 30:15.440
It's down in the lower garden there.

30:15.440 --> 30:17.640
It's in Kenya, but it's a tree from India.

30:17.640 --> 30:19.760
It makes a lovely shade.

30:19.760 --> 30:26.440
This is a jacaranda that was trimmed and it's got three main trunks.

30:26.440 --> 30:34.200
It once had long branches, but now with the decimation, new sprouts have come up all at

30:34.200 --> 30:35.400
about the same time.

30:35.400 --> 30:40.440
Now, we can imagine if a human population or any animal species or even plant species

30:40.440 --> 30:50.920
population is reduced to a small number, then they become the progenitors of everybody afterwards.

30:50.920 --> 30:55.960
And if you measure the length of these, you can say from this branch tip to that branch

30:55.960 --> 31:04.720
tip divided by two, knowing the growth rate gets us back to about the time of the chopping.

31:04.720 --> 31:08.800
And then to get to another main trunk, you have to go much further.

31:08.800 --> 31:11.520
This is the picture of Africa, actually.

31:11.520 --> 31:19.520
There's a lot of different main branches and subdivisions that all coalesce to large trunks

31:19.520 --> 31:26.720
and then the large branches coalesce to a main trunk.

31:26.720 --> 31:33.520
On one of these side branches here, two of these wisps account for everybody outside

31:33.520 --> 31:34.520
of Africa.

31:34.520 --> 31:37.000
I'll show you that.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.640
But let's do a little simulation here.

31:38.640 --> 31:48.120
I'm going to teach you how we can turn a theoretical family tree, one ancestor, two ancestors,

31:48.880 --> 31:56.360
and then these four sisters, if we can say these are females, give rise all at about

31:56.360 --> 32:02.280
the same time, maybe when the climate got good, to a bunch of people, lineages that

32:02.280 --> 32:03.560
have survived to the present.

32:03.560 --> 32:09.000
Each of these little X's would be a mutation along a lineage that differentiates them.

32:09.000 --> 32:13.480
And you could cut up the number of mutational units that separate this person from the other

32:13.520 --> 32:20.680
49 and do these pairwise comparisons and then calculate some statistics and get a frequency

32:20.680 --> 32:24.080
distribution of the number of pairwise differences.

32:24.080 --> 32:30.760
If there was a population explosion at seven mutational units of time in the past, then

32:30.760 --> 32:35.200
you get this kind of a hump, wave-like distribution.

32:35.200 --> 32:40.960
So population expansions make waves that look like this.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.800
Let's look at some humans and apes.

32:43.800 --> 32:49.120
So if the expansion was recent, there might only be instead of seven site differences,

32:49.120 --> 32:50.800
there might be two or three.

32:50.800 --> 32:57.520
And we could call this a rake-like expansion of rake-like family tree, but with short times

32:57.520 --> 33:01.560
means a recent expansion.

33:01.560 --> 33:08.040
Only a few mutations have accumulated in all the lineages from the ancestral lineage.

33:08.040 --> 33:12.800
If it was further back in time, we would get longer tines on the rake, and there would

33:12.800 --> 33:16.720
be little sub-tines poking out.

33:16.720 --> 33:19.720
Okay.

33:19.720 --> 33:28.480
So here we have three branches within the western chimpanzees that have exploded at about the

33:28.480 --> 33:29.960
same time.

33:29.960 --> 33:32.440
So we could call these clades or branches.

33:32.440 --> 33:38.920
So we have three nested clades within the western chimpanzees.

33:38.920 --> 33:42.880
They coalesce back to Nigerians.

33:42.880 --> 33:46.280
Eastern chimpanzees have one big expansion.

33:46.280 --> 33:48.680
Central chimpanzees don't look like they expanded.

33:48.680 --> 33:53.680
There have been stable populations that have had lineages that have survived for a long

33:53.680 --> 33:54.680
time.

33:54.680 --> 33:58.360
This is 811 humans from around the world.

33:58.360 --> 34:04.920
Not much genetic diversity at all, less than the eastern chimpanzees.

34:04.920 --> 34:11.040
And here's where Neanderthals fit in.

34:11.040 --> 34:12.040
Okay.

34:12.040 --> 34:19.480
So eastern chimpanzees, which live in the most ecologically sensitive areas, most likely

34:19.480 --> 34:25.680
to get their forests dried up during ice ages, have the smallest genetic diversity among

34:25.680 --> 34:30.000
the chimps, almost like humans.

34:30.000 --> 34:34.880
And here's what it looks like when we turn it into that wave-like distribution, the frequency

34:34.880 --> 34:35.880
distribution.

34:35.880 --> 34:38.600
Modern humans almost know genetic diversity.

34:38.600 --> 34:43.400
Eastern chimpanzees, an interesting little bump here, won't have time to talk about that.

34:43.400 --> 34:50.240
Central, Nigerian, western chimpanzees, gorillas.

34:50.240 --> 34:58.360
So we look like we're missing most of our genetic diversity around the world.

34:58.360 --> 35:05.000
If we compare different human populations, take the nested clade approach, we can see

35:05.000 --> 35:15.400
that the people in Africa that belong to a maternal group that's been called L has the

35:15.400 --> 35:19.880
greatest number of genetic differences among people.

35:19.880 --> 35:30.520
If we compare people from southern, eastern Asia, Australasia, including Australians and

35:30.520 --> 35:38.080
Melanesians and so forth, they have slightly more genetic diversity than northern Eurasians.

35:38.080 --> 35:44.280
And we can put a time of the beginning of the expansion, this peak here, in terms of

35:44.280 --> 35:50.360
number of mutational units and how much time it took those mutations to accumulate.

35:50.360 --> 35:57.800
This is about 70, 60, and 50,000 years ago.

35:57.800 --> 36:00.000
So that's an interesting thing.

36:00.000 --> 36:07.480
Populations expanding sometime about after Toba erupts, and then these populations are

36:07.480 --> 36:17.040
expanding out of Africa at the end of that very cold marine isotope stage four that was

36:17.040 --> 36:21.000
very cold from 70 to 60.

36:21.000 --> 36:29.960
So the reconstruction that's been made of this is that people out of this subgroup of

36:29.960 --> 36:37.080
the L lineage went across the south end of the Red Sea, the Babel Mandeb Straits called

36:37.080 --> 36:45.680
the Gates of Tears, and another subpopulation of this L3 went out across the Sinai.

36:45.680 --> 36:50.680
And the ones that went out across the Sinai we call N subgroup, and the ones that went

36:50.680 --> 36:59.960
out across the south end of the Red Sea are in the M subgroup of the L3 of East Africa.

36:59.960 --> 37:03.600
Now they originated in East Africa.

37:03.640 --> 37:11.560
The most diverse branches of these M's and N's are in Kenya, Tanzania, and Ethiopia.

37:11.560 --> 37:15.240
So everybody outside of Africa is not just an African.

37:15.240 --> 37:18.840
They're an East African.

37:18.840 --> 37:24.920
Very different from the West African L0s, 1s, and 2s.

37:24.920 --> 37:29.040
So this is the whole family tree on the maternal DNA.

37:29.040 --> 37:31.640
Goes back to 200,000 years.

37:31.680 --> 37:35.480
Here's our L3 and a little bit of L4.

37:35.480 --> 37:41.520
And these two little subbranches of L3 are the non-Africans.

37:41.520 --> 37:48.080
There's more genetic difference between individuals in a single African village than there is

37:48.080 --> 37:58.200
between people from Asia, Japan, all the way to Iceland, from Australia to Iceland.

37:59.200 --> 38:00.200
Okay.

38:00.200 --> 38:05.520
Oh, yeah, one more thing about this.

38:05.520 --> 38:11.600
Lots of lineages, these are major lineages, were founded in this period around 80,000

38:11.600 --> 38:14.320
to 70,000, 60,000 years ago.

38:14.320 --> 38:17.280
The genetic dating is not very tight.

38:17.280 --> 38:19.320
It's got big error margins.

38:19.320 --> 38:25.120
So other populations, other species that have gone through population expansions from small

38:25.120 --> 38:30.920
sizes include chimpanzees, the Eastern chimpanzees, lowland gorillas.

38:30.920 --> 38:38.040
Nuclear DNA was shared between West Africa and East Africa.

38:38.040 --> 38:42.480
Eastern and Western lowland gorillas are presently separated by thousands of miles.

38:42.480 --> 38:46.480
They were exchanging genes 77,000 years ago.

38:46.480 --> 38:49.440
Big surprise.

38:49.440 --> 38:53.960
Gorillas have a bottleneck around 70,000 or expansion.

38:53.960 --> 38:57.680
Macaque monkeys in central India, about 55,000 years.

38:57.680 --> 39:06.280
All tigers on earth have one lucky mother, 73,000 years ago, according to the geneticists

39:06.280 --> 39:08.320
Luo.

39:08.320 --> 39:16.880
And ancient DNA tells us about cave bears in their population history and Neanderthals.

39:16.880 --> 39:18.400
That was a big surprise.

39:18.440 --> 39:20.080
Let's look at Neanderthals.

39:20.080 --> 39:22.240
First we'll just look at orangutans.

39:22.240 --> 39:25.560
So there's fossil orangutans that gone.

39:25.560 --> 39:32.400
Let's compare Borneo to Sumatra and orangutan genetics.

39:32.400 --> 39:38.480
There, that's a garden rate that looks like it's been worn down to a stub.

39:38.480 --> 39:42.720
Hardly any distance between all of the individuals, genetic distance.

39:42.720 --> 39:47.400
So the length of these teeth is practically zero.

39:47.400 --> 39:52.440
And it turns into this pair-wise frequency of just a few differences.

39:52.440 --> 40:02.840
The Sumatran ones, it's a funny way of drawing it, but to go from this patch of orangutan

40:02.840 --> 40:08.040
DNA sequences to that one, you have to go all the way back to there.

40:08.040 --> 40:12.320
And they're the ones that are scattered out here with many genetic differences between

40:12.320 --> 40:14.240
pairs of individuals.

40:14.240 --> 40:17.360
So let's look at Neanderthals.

40:17.360 --> 40:23.200
This paper was published in Science, well this is just the cover story.

40:23.200 --> 40:30.920
Neanderthal bones and their DNA has been giving up their DNA for a couple of decades now.

40:30.920 --> 40:35.760
And some of them now go off this map.

40:35.760 --> 40:38.160
And this covers Western Europe.

40:38.160 --> 40:46.400
These are all Neanderthals that died, radiocarbon dated somewhere around 40, 45,000 years ago.

40:46.440 --> 40:50.880
East Toba eruption.

40:50.880 --> 40:54.640
The ones that have yielded their DNA, these are all very closely related.

40:54.640 --> 40:59.000
And you can see Africans here for comparison.

40:59.000 --> 41:03.440
Very deep branches in the African DNA, there's our L3.

41:03.440 --> 41:10.160
And you can see that the M and N are just subsets of the whole L3, non-Africans.

41:10.160 --> 41:18.040
So we are all East Africans unless we're from West Africa or South Africa.

41:18.040 --> 41:23.080
So this paper was published in 2012 with more DNA sequences.

41:23.080 --> 41:27.680
And you can see this short-time garden rake kind of distribution.

41:27.680 --> 41:30.280
They're dead by about 40,000.

41:30.280 --> 41:38.840
Their common maternal ancestor for all of them in Western Europe lived 60,000 years ago.

41:39.320 --> 41:43.160
Coincidentally, the end of that very cold period.

41:43.160 --> 41:45.400
Marine isotope stage four.

41:45.400 --> 41:47.440
So this population expanded.

41:47.440 --> 41:51.880
There are the dates, it's maybe hard to see.

41:51.880 --> 41:53.840
And they lived for 20,000 years.

41:53.840 --> 42:00.920
It was about 43,000 years ago when people from Africa made it that far into Western Europe.

42:00.920 --> 42:07.640
So Western Europe was depopulated according to the geneticists.

42:07.640 --> 42:15.880
Sometime in the early last Ice Age and repopulated 60,000 years ago.

42:15.880 --> 42:19.120
I kind of like this.

42:19.120 --> 42:21.160
What were Neanderthals like?

42:21.160 --> 42:23.920
How well did they behave?

42:23.920 --> 42:27.440
Everything you thought about them was true.

42:27.440 --> 42:30.560
And that includes me.

42:30.600 --> 42:38.480
I found out when I graduated high school that I was Neanderthal man, Newton high.

42:38.480 --> 42:44.600
Okay, the fossil record of them, the archaeological record of them is not pretty.

42:44.600 --> 42:48.760
There's lots of interpersonal violence and trauma.

42:48.760 --> 42:56.720
This is a painting from reconstruction of what was going on at Krapina in Croatia.

42:56.720 --> 43:01.680
Where they had 49 individuals, most of whom were butchered.

43:01.680 --> 43:04.480
He's cradling somebody's head in his lap.

43:04.480 --> 43:07.400
This one's breaking open the femur.

43:07.400 --> 43:13.320
This guy's chewing on another long bone of one of his neighbors.

43:13.320 --> 43:14.640
We're very nice to each other.

43:14.640 --> 43:22.840
Most archaeological sites have little scraps of Neanderthal bone that have traces of burning cut marks and hammer marks on them.

43:22.840 --> 43:24.760
You don't hear about most of these.

43:24.800 --> 43:36.760
You hear about the full skeletons that are severely arthritic, traumatized, healed bones, broken bones, re-healed, lots of nasty stuff.

43:36.760 --> 43:38.200
Cannibalism.

43:38.200 --> 43:47.360
They used stone tools that you would imagine you could find, not just imagine, you can find the geological sources.

43:47.360 --> 43:56.200
Within the home range of a hunter-gatherer in a relatively rich territory.

43:56.200 --> 44:00.720
They don't look like they were planning their predation very well.

44:00.720 --> 44:04.840
The arguments about how much they scavenged versus hunted.

44:04.840 --> 44:11.080
They had small home ranges by the stone tool site to source distances.

44:11.080 --> 44:15.600
They engaged in strenuous activities for most of the day.

44:15.600 --> 44:17.480
Giving them all this arthritis.

44:17.480 --> 44:18.760
They had short lifespans.

44:18.760 --> 44:23.400
It's been argued that they didn't live long enough to be grandparents.

44:23.400 --> 44:28.080
And that's important for social learning, I think, and for survival.

44:28.080 --> 44:34.160
They carried around stone tools that archaeologists loved to classify.

44:34.160 --> 44:40.960
And I'm a primary practitioner of Professor Movious's craft and skill.

44:40.960 --> 44:48.040
So I know just how disappointing some of these tool kits can be, the early ones,

44:48.040 --> 44:54.040
because it's easier to say what they did to a rock than what you call it.

44:54.040 --> 45:04.080
Later in time, you can look at artifacts and say, ah, that's a type 22, no doubt about it.

45:04.080 --> 45:06.120
They seem to have been strongly territorial.

45:06.120 --> 45:09.360
Were they like chimpanzee troops?

45:09.360 --> 45:10.520
That's the question.

45:10.520 --> 45:15.600
Now, let's look at some of the archaeology I've done just very briefly.

45:15.600 --> 45:20.200
I've been working in Kenya for a long time, about 40 years.

45:20.200 --> 45:23.840
These two areas are lots of fun.

45:23.840 --> 45:27.760
This is one of the sites in the southern area along the Intuka River.

45:27.760 --> 45:31.520
And down here at the bottom, there's a volcanic ash you can't really see.

45:31.520 --> 45:33.880
It's not the Tobash.

45:33.880 --> 45:37.160
It's about 52,000 years down there.

45:37.160 --> 45:40.960
We get some of these large, generalized, all-purpose tools,

45:40.960 --> 45:48.280
like this large spearhead-sized, big knife thing, and little small blade segments.

45:48.280 --> 45:55.520
Very sharp obsidian volcanic glass comes from about 70, 80 kilometers away.

45:55.520 --> 45:56.760
These are all-purpose tools.

45:56.760 --> 46:05.320
These are highly specialized, displacable, replaceable, disposable things.

46:05.880 --> 46:08.720
The big ones are a jack-of-all-trades kind of tool.

46:08.720 --> 46:15.920
And we can see the rise after a quarter million years ago to about 105,000 years ago.

46:15.920 --> 46:20.800
Suddenly, in the last Ice Age, we start to see lots of this obsidian,

46:20.800 --> 46:27.480
which is coming from quite a distance, 60 to 100 kilometers from the archaeological sites,

46:27.480 --> 46:34.800
shooting up to as much as 65% of the artifacts in the bottom of that section I just showed you.

46:34.800 --> 46:37.960
That means a lot of interaction over long distances.

46:41.160 --> 46:46.520
In South Africa, in that site where the volcanic ash was found at Pinnacle Point,

46:46.520 --> 46:52.640
directly above the sand layer, we find the same kinds of blade segments,

46:52.640 --> 47:00.040
the disposable, sharp, easily replaceable, thin, fragile tools.

47:00.040 --> 47:06.080
They're replacing these thick, robust tools that you could use for all kinds of circumstances.

47:06.080 --> 47:12.320
I've made the argument that these are very effective because they're very sharp.

47:12.320 --> 47:14.200
They're easy to replace.

47:14.200 --> 47:19.160
You can make specialized toolkits, and you can bring along the right replacement parts

47:19.160 --> 47:22.800
if you've planned out your day, your activities.

47:22.800 --> 47:27.160
Neanderthals, Stephen Kuhn at the University of Arizona said,

47:27.160 --> 47:30.200
their toolkits look like they were planning for the unanticipated,

47:30.200 --> 47:37.760
planning for the unplanned, big tools that they could modify as needed when they encountered something.

47:37.760 --> 47:41.400
So that's quite different.

47:41.400 --> 47:45.600
Well, that's enough archaeology for now.

47:45.600 --> 47:48.400
How do we survive?

47:48.400 --> 47:50.120
Why did Neanderthals die out?

47:50.120 --> 47:52.960
That's the real important question here.

47:53.920 --> 47:57.320
I'm sorry.

47:57.320 --> 48:01.280
I can't think of Neanderthals after looking at the totality of the evidence

48:01.280 --> 48:07.520
that they were much different than Mad Max beyond Thunderdown.

48:07.520 --> 48:13.840
Tina Turner, Mel Gibson, well, I won't say anything about Mel,

48:13.840 --> 48:22.640
but he's got that kind of reactionary us against them kind of mentality.

48:22.640 --> 48:25.880
So Neanderthals faced off to modern humans.

48:25.880 --> 48:27.720
What was the advantage?

48:27.720 --> 48:30.800
They're obviously a lot stronger than us.

48:34.800 --> 48:41.040
I think that humans before Tova didn't have this long-distance transport

48:41.040 --> 48:45.400
of the archaeological materials that show that they got outside of their home ranges

48:45.400 --> 48:47.760
and came home again very often.

48:47.760 --> 48:50.520
There's small amounts, but not a lot.

48:50.520 --> 48:53.240
And I would say they were more cooperative afterwards.

48:53.240 --> 48:54.680
Neanderthals never were.

48:54.680 --> 49:00.320
Last archaeological sites made by Neanderthals look like the one the quarter million years ago.

49:00.320 --> 49:03.760
The archaeologists who work on these throw up their hands and say,

49:03.760 --> 49:06.520
well, they just didn't change.

49:06.520 --> 49:08.080
It didn't matter what the climate was.

49:08.080 --> 49:13.560
And it must have been just the right thing, you know, like bacteria.

49:13.560 --> 49:15.720
They've really worked it out.

49:15.720 --> 49:17.720
They've got the all-purpose toolkit.

49:17.720 --> 49:26.040
Now, I think that one of the most important things about modern people is

49:26.040 --> 49:28.760
that they have these social relationships.

49:28.760 --> 49:33.200
And they cement these ties with gifts and symbolic things.

49:33.200 --> 49:35.920
I'm wearing some beads now that were a gift.

49:35.920 --> 49:41.280
This woman is wearing her social capital, 25 Bushman exchange partners

49:41.280 --> 49:43.960
that she's had for most of her life.

49:43.960 --> 49:50.400
And this just is a marker that she has friends she's trusting.

49:50.400 --> 49:55.800
She cooperates, she reciprocates, she gives as much as she receives.

49:55.800 --> 49:59.680
These are the kinds of people you want in a tough environment

49:59.680 --> 50:01.560
where you're all in the lifeboat.

50:01.560 --> 50:02.960
This is really important.

50:02.960 --> 50:05.320
We see she's wearing a lot of ostrich egg shell beads.

50:05.320 --> 50:07.080
They go back 50,000 years.

50:07.080 --> 50:08.520
I've dug up these.

50:08.520 --> 50:13.640
They're older than 40,000 years old in the Kenya Rift Valley.

50:13.640 --> 50:17.440
And these simple little things, they're really tiny.

50:17.440 --> 50:21.240
That's a one-inch pin down there for scale.

50:21.240 --> 50:24.960
May have been the first formal tokens.

50:24.960 --> 50:29.120
I called them small things remembered.

50:29.120 --> 50:32.840
Let's just move this over here.

50:32.840 --> 50:36.840
And these people have these chains of relationships.

50:36.840 --> 50:39.840
The attitude that lots of archaeologists have when they look

50:39.840 --> 50:45.720
at the archaeological record is that it's always us versus them,

50:45.720 --> 50:47.720
a zero-sum game.

50:47.720 --> 50:48.640
But there's a new math.

50:52.600 --> 50:56.920
If I give to you, it's not my loss.

50:56.920 --> 50:58.160
I'm multiplying.

50:58.160 --> 51:01.680
If two people cooperate, one person

51:01.680 --> 51:04.880
may just be able to feed themself and their family maybe.

51:04.880 --> 51:06.920
Two people, three people cooperating.

51:06.920 --> 51:10.120
They can feed the whole camp.

51:10.120 --> 51:15.000
So 1 plus 1 may equal 3, 4, or 5.

51:15.000 --> 51:18.320
There's no negative in reciprocity.

51:18.320 --> 51:21.280
But if you cheat, you may get shunned.

51:21.280 --> 51:28.400
So rather than your gain is my loss,

51:28.400 --> 51:29.920
we might want to think about Yates.

51:32.640 --> 51:35.400
And I think this is a way they thought about the world, and they do.

51:37.040 --> 51:39.840
They go out of their way to try to make new relationships with people.

51:39.840 --> 51:40.640
Here, take this.

51:40.640 --> 51:41.880
It's a gift.

51:41.880 --> 51:44.120
I want you to have it.

51:44.120 --> 51:48.600
This was told to me by Ed Wilmson, who worked among the Bushmen.

51:48.600 --> 51:49.280
It's yours.

51:49.280 --> 51:50.320
I want you to have it.

51:50.320 --> 51:51.320
Don't you forget it.

51:55.360 --> 51:59.480
So that's where we are.

51:59.480 --> 52:03.560
I would argue that during the really tough times brought on

52:03.560 --> 52:07.760
by this Toba eruption, especially the first 1,800 years,

52:07.760 --> 52:12.400
people in Africa worked out systems of reciprocity, trust,

52:12.400 --> 52:16.400
and cooperation that Neanderthals never did.

52:16.400 --> 52:19.840
And with the cooperation sharing and exchange of information,

52:19.840 --> 52:24.760
they could make those toolkits that look like the right tools for the job.

52:24.760 --> 52:28.960
Neanderthals don't look like they had an information sharing-based use

52:28.960 --> 52:31.280
of the landscape.

52:31.280 --> 52:35.400
I call this a culturally constructed landscape.

52:35.400 --> 52:37.960
They know where to go and what to do on the landscape because they've

52:37.960 --> 52:41.600
got information that they've gotten shared through cultural mechanisms,

52:41.600 --> 52:46.280
language, through friendships, their networks.

52:46.280 --> 52:49.040
Neanderthals don't look like they had these networks.

52:49.040 --> 52:54.280
They probably spoke in the imperative.

52:54.280 --> 52:57.240
They didn't have these extended social landscapes.

52:57.240 --> 52:59.320
If they left home, they were dinner.

53:01.600 --> 53:06.560
So it looks like they developed the original social security system

53:06.560 --> 53:11.520
as the best way I can describe it with reciprocal gift exchange.

53:11.520 --> 53:15.080
So I'm pinning, based upon the archaeology,

53:15.080 --> 53:20.240
where we see the hard evidence for extended social landscapes

53:20.240 --> 53:25.200
in stone tools that have traveled further than the distance of the diameter

53:25.200 --> 53:31.160
of 100 gatherers territory, even in the driest environments.

53:31.160 --> 53:35.760
That's where I pin this troop to tribe transition.

53:35.760 --> 53:40.720
So this also helps facilitate the exploitation of very risky habitats.

53:40.720 --> 53:44.480
You can go out somewhere knowing you have a safety net to come back to.

53:44.480 --> 53:47.600
If resources fail, you can move in with your friends.

53:47.600 --> 53:52.320
A lot of this networking is about reciprocal rights of access

53:52.320 --> 53:55.800
to each other's territories without getting shot.

53:55.800 --> 54:00.840
So this would also allow expansions out of Africa.

54:00.840 --> 54:06.040
So the timing out of Africa, 60 to 50,000 years ago, fits with this.

54:08.680 --> 54:09.960
They worked out the system.

54:09.960 --> 54:12.480
They did all the R&D in Africa.

54:12.480 --> 54:15.680
And what we think of is it was upper paleolithic mammoth hunters

54:15.680 --> 54:20.280
and painters making beautiful blades and art, fancy tools.

54:20.280 --> 54:25.040
Those things go back 30,000 years earlier in Africa.

54:25.040 --> 54:33.880
So cooperative tribes could outcompete Neanderthal troops.

54:33.880 --> 54:37.960
Now, I'm not sure if I have more time.

54:37.960 --> 54:42.680
Christian, I could cut it off here.

54:42.680 --> 54:48.520
And because what I'm going to do now would take you

54:48.520 --> 54:52.200
in a completely different direction.

54:52.200 --> 54:53.760
Is it all right?

54:53.800 --> 54:56.800
All right, here we go.

54:56.800 --> 55:00.240
The biology of cooperation.

55:00.240 --> 55:06.920
I was stunned with the epiphany when I read a paper in Scientific American

55:06.920 --> 55:15.000
in July 2008 about oxytocin, the love hormone, the trust hormone.

55:15.000 --> 55:21.080
And that there are genes that underlie the susceptibility to the influence

55:21.080 --> 55:23.320
of these pro and antisocial hormones.

55:23.360 --> 55:25.560
And they vary among individuals.

55:25.560 --> 55:30.280
And they're widespread throughout the animal kingdom, vertebrate animals.

55:30.280 --> 55:33.440
And even invertebrates.

55:33.440 --> 55:36.560
They are things like oxytocin.

55:36.560 --> 55:42.280
Some variants of serotonin and vasopressin are more pro-social.

55:42.280 --> 55:45.200
Testosterone is an antisocial one.

55:45.200 --> 55:48.080
Fill her up with testosterone.

55:48.080 --> 55:50.160
We know about that.

55:50.160 --> 55:54.160
Each hormone system does have actually pro and antisocial variants.

55:54.160 --> 55:58.240
Some people are totally resistant to the effects of oxytocin.

55:58.240 --> 56:05.160
Others, I think that the used car salesmen might be spraying it around their offices.

56:05.160 --> 56:07.200
Some people are suckers.

56:07.200 --> 56:14.360
And you can, in the laboratory, make them more generous, more accepting of less

56:14.360 --> 56:18.920
generous offers, more tolerant, and more likely to give.

56:18.920 --> 56:21.160
Some don't do it at all.

56:21.160 --> 56:24.720
Did Neanderthals have mainly antisocial variants of these hormones?

56:24.720 --> 56:30.360
Were they more predominant prior to TOBA?

56:30.360 --> 56:33.440
We'll see if we can figure this out.

56:33.440 --> 56:38.760
Did frequencies of pro-social genes increase in Africans during the bottleneck?

56:38.760 --> 56:41.480
The time when you need the most trust and cooperation?

56:41.480 --> 56:44.880
If you were living in a very, very small population, I didn't tell you that

56:44.880 --> 56:50.600
geneticists say that the genetic diversity of today could be accounted for by 5,000

56:50.600 --> 56:55.440
breeding-aged females 70,000 years ago.

56:55.440 --> 57:04.000
You could multiply that by six for parents, non-reproductive males and females, 60,000

57:04.000 --> 57:05.000
people.

57:05.000 --> 57:10.400
It is enough to account for the genetic diversity of the whole planet, a little bit higher now

57:10.400 --> 57:13.720
because they keep measuring more genetic diversity in Africa.

57:14.280 --> 57:15.840
Do hormones fossilize?

57:15.840 --> 57:19.440
Well, I don't think so.

57:19.440 --> 57:20.440
You never know.

57:20.440 --> 57:22.040
Biochemistry is getting great.

57:22.040 --> 57:28.480
I was hoping to get this by answer out of the genes in the fossil bones themselves, but

57:28.480 --> 57:35.680
most fossil bones don't have genes, genetics preserved, genes preserved, but testosterone

57:35.680 --> 57:42.400
seems to have some interesting skeletal effects and some of the other hormones do too.

57:42.400 --> 57:49.200
We know this clinically that it will increase the jaw length and facial height of young

57:49.200 --> 57:54.840
boys if you give them extra testosterone during puberty, if they're having delayed puberty.

57:54.840 --> 58:00.080
Orthodontists need to know this.

58:00.080 --> 58:09.440
Jessamy Doman and Andrew Hill and colleagues at Yale presented this paper two years ago

58:09.480 --> 58:17.040
at the Paleoanthropology Society, a new osteological approach to inferring social behavior, hominin

58:17.040 --> 58:23.200
social behavior, facial indicators of testosterone level.

58:23.200 --> 58:32.600
Indeed, there's a fossil trace of testosterone and they concluded that early Homo sapiens

58:32.600 --> 58:41.120
and Homo neanderthalensis, so that's Homo sapiens earlier than 80,000, had elevated

58:41.120 --> 58:47.120
levels of testosterone and maybe more male-male competition.

58:47.120 --> 58:51.440
We know a lot about that.

58:51.440 --> 58:57.760
High salivary testosterone is linked to masculine male facial appearance.

58:57.760 --> 59:02.400
This is an Australian aborigine.

59:02.400 --> 59:07.480
That's one of the most complete skeletons that was known in the early 1900s.

59:07.480 --> 59:10.360
Marcel Boule put this together.

59:10.360 --> 59:16.840
After learning about this face-shaped stuff, I started looking at these skulls in a very

59:16.840 --> 59:21.480
different way as maybe the product of sexual selection.

59:21.480 --> 59:24.120
Neanderthals have these big jutting faces.

59:24.120 --> 59:25.720
This is a pre-Neanderthal.

59:25.760 --> 59:30.520
Look at the third molar here, how far it's angled out.

59:30.520 --> 59:34.880
It's as if they were trying to get that jaw out as far as they could.

59:34.880 --> 59:37.000
It's amazing.

59:37.000 --> 59:38.320
There's a big gap there.

59:38.320 --> 59:41.400
We can't stick our finger behind our third molar.

59:41.400 --> 59:44.640
The jaw ascending ramus is in the way.

59:44.640 --> 59:50.680
They could stick a big, sharpie marker pen back there.

59:50.680 --> 59:52.200
That's a big gap.

59:52.200 --> 59:54.160
Why were those teeth getting pulled out?

59:54.160 --> 59:56.600
Why was the jaw pulling out like that?

59:56.600 --> 01:00:00.400
They had huge noses too, big nasal passages.

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:03.320
Well, how about voices?

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:07.160
This is a different way of looking at things.

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:11.440
The larynx can grow completely out of proportion to other body parts under the influence of

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:16.280
testosterone at puberty in human males.

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:21.160
Hypertrophied larynx of human males and their disproportionately low-pitched voices are

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:31.160
an adaptation to exaggerating body size, just like beards.

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:39.440
We use voices to assess physical strength and fighting ability, don't we?

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:41.800
I brought a heuristic device here.

01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:49.640
With my grandchildren, I can give them a little scare if I go, I can give them shock and fright

01:00:49.640 --> 01:01:02.960
if I go, so you musicians know, tenor sax, alto, you name it, the bigger, the vocal tract,

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:08.720
the super pharyngeal vocal tract, the deeper your voice.

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:13.440
So there's a modern human and luscious pell again.

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:18.840
If we keep the hyoid in the same position, that's what holds your voice box, then the

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:23.400
distance to wherever the lips might be out here would be quite large.

01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:34.560
Now, we know this, that people with big lower faces have deep voices, Barry White.

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:39.440
And Ron Perlman, his first big role was the Neanderthal Inquest for Fire.

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:42.880
He has a really deep voice.

01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:45.440
I was in, let's see, where was this?

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:46.440
This is Beijing.

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:53.800
I think, yes, that was in the Beijing Museum, across from Tiananmen Square in, just Christmas,

01:01:53.800 --> 01:02:01.520
actually, and I just, just struck by the, the fighter, it's a full-size ceramic tricolor

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:07.640
statue, three-glazed statue of a fighter, and I thought, well, yeah, he looks like a

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:08.640
fighter.

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:09.840
Look at that jaw.

01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:14.320
And if you go into all the Buddhist shrines and temples, you will see that the Buddha

01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:19.480
is surrounded by guys with these huge lower faces and big brow ridges, even though he

01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:23.480
has a real baby face.

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:24.840
They're protecting him.

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:32.240
Now, the last part of hormones, testosterone responses are related to facial masculinity

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:40.760
for competition, testosterone administration decreases generosity, okay, but oxytocin

01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:43.280
increases trust.

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:49.360
Now, Professor Rangham, I think he had to leave here, he's part of this research group

01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:57.480
and Peter Ellison as well, and most of the people on this list are just upstairs here.

01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:03.720
Among chimpanzees, testosterone levels increase markedly during adolescence.

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:06.280
This is a common chimpanzee.

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:15.240
The bonobo, which is the, I suppose you could call them the free love hippie chimpanzees,

01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:16.240
do not change.

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:20.360
Now, let's just do a little comparison here.

01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:26.960
Bonobos, I'm calling them tribes because of the last point on this list.

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:31.160
Females are dominant, they have low sexual dimorphism, there's not a lot of difference

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:34.640
between males and females.

01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:41.400
Females are very rare, intergroup counters are amazing, they're peaceful, they party.

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:50.120
The males get kind of like, but then they say, I give up, and they come together peacefully

01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:56.800
and then they go on their separate ways, feeling good.

01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:04.400
Sea troops, Professor Rangham here is well documented, lots of aspects of their male

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:07.080
aggression, he's written a whole book about it.

01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:12.360
They have high sexual dimorphism, big canines compared to the females.

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:17.160
They are highly aggressive and they have these intergroup encounters that are violent and

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:18.160
often deadly.

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:24.520
A group of males will go off and patrol, they'll sit and listen, see if they can find a lone

01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:30.520
male and then they'll kill him.

01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:36.560
The last piece of the puzzle was published last summer, 2014.

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:40.760
This is supposed to be an anatomically modern human, sometimes I wasn't sure if they were

01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:42.760
Neanderthals.

01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:48.160
Very rugged, they're older than 80,000, at places like Shkuhul and Kafsa Cave in Israel.

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:51.480
Here's a post 80,000 year old skeleton.

01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:57.400
Most of the, all the humans younger than 80,000 are much less robust.

01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:03.320
Something happened around that time of Toba.

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:13.400
The hypothesis I proposed in 2010 that Toba was a strong selective force for killing off

01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:19.720
anti-social people among the Africans in those harsh environments is quite consistent with

01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:20.720
this.

01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:25.200
So that's my hypothesis.

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:27.040
So here we are.

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:35.600
It's not just charisma, image and sarcasm, against more basic instincts.

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:38.440
I think Neanderthals spoke in the imperative.

01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:41.120
Okay, you can fill in the caption here.

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:45.320
Maybe you remember this episode of Star Trek.

01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:51.600
Kirk and his crew are captives in the Klingon ship.

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:57.800
And Kirk looks at him and he says, what do you think he's saying to the Klingon commander

01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:00.720
that's going to get them out of there?

01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:06.880
He says something to the effect.

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:12.360
And he turns around and he snarls at his command, his second in command.

01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:16.760
And they start fighting amongst themselves like a big bar fight.

01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:22.680
And these guys just steal away and go, beam me up, Scotty.

01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:26.680
Short tempered.

01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:36.240
Now, catastrophic theories usually put you on the fringe.

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:42.320
I don't have a Nobel Prize to promote something that is now widely accepted but has taken

01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:47.840
40 years and there's still holdouts that the asteroid that hit the Yucatan Peninsula

01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:53.360
65,000 years ago wasn't responsible for big change.

01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:58.240
So if that asteroid didn't happen, where would we be now?

01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:01.840
We'd be scurrying around in the underbrush and up in the tips of trees, watching out

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:05.640
for those snapping jaws.

01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:13.840
So we could make the same question about what happened 73,880 years ago.

01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:21.040
Would we still be more like primate troops than human tribes?

01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:27.200
That's a hard question to answer because we have lots of evidence of some artistic creativity

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:29.560
before 80,000 years ago.

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:39.280
But creativity and art and pro-sociality, that's not a perfect one-to-one correlation,

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:41.080
so to speak.

01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:44.880
Anyways, that's my story and I'm sticking with it.
