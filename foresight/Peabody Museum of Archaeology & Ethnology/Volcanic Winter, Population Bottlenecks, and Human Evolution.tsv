0	8840	Thanks very much.
8840	14160	Archeology is not just about unearthing artifacts, it's sometimes about unearthing new information,
14160	17200	new photographs, new images in the archives, and these are just sort of a fun series of
17200	22120	photographs that I recently came across in the archives in the Bannoncroft Library at
22120	26160	University of California Berkeley, including my favorite Moevious on his first camel.
26160	28760	I don't know if you can work out the caption there in the lower side.
29720	34560	Some nice work that he was doing as a graduate student in the early 1930s at a site in Israel
34560	37280	called Mugaret S. School.
37280	41960	So as you've heard tonight is the annual Halamel Moevious Junior Lecturer.
41960	45440	Professor Moevious was a distinguished scholar, a curator and archaeologist here at Harvard
45440	46960	University.
46960	50680	He was really internationally recognized as a paleolithic archaeologist, but he did
50680	51680	a wide range of things.
51680	52680	This is really important.
52680	56960	His work ranged from the Irish Mesolithic to the sort of East Asian Lower Paleolithic
57000	61880	and probably most famously upper paleolithic sites such as Avery Patot in southwestern
61880	63400	France.
63400	67880	Importantly, with his appointment here in 1939 as curator in the Peabody and then later
67880	72480	in appointment as a lecturer in the Department of Anthropology in 1948, he was the first
72480	75880	paleolithic archaeologist working at Harvard.
75880	82480	So there's a tie-in here in that the point of me being up here is to introduce tonight's
82480	85600	speaker Dr. Stanley Ambrose, which I'm very happy to do.
85640	87480	The tie-in is twofold.
87480	93680	One, as I just learned, Stan is actually from the same hometown as Professor Moevious, Newton,
93680	99280	right here, attended UMass Boston as an undergraduate, but he was also received as PhD in 1984 at
99280	104000	the University of California, Berkeley, under Dr. Glenn Isaac, who then came here in 1983
104000	107840	as the second paleolithic archaeologist after Dr. Moevious's retirement.
107840	109640	So there's a nice tie-in there.
109640	114440	The other tie-in is that I think like Dr. Moevious and like the sort of mission of the
114440	118880	Harvard Museum of Science and Culture, Dr. Ambrose's research and his research interest
118880	123080	really cut across a wide range of different time periods.
123080	127600	It involves work from a wide diversity of different geographic locations, and it really
127600	131640	embraces a sort of natural science approach to figuring out the past, not just archaeology,
131640	137720	but really embracing a wide variety of different ways of thinking about reconstructing the human
137720	140680	past and the environment in which early humans lived.
140680	145400	So tonight, one part of this, as you'll hear, Professor Ambrose will be discussing the archeological
145400	150960	evidence for the impact of enormous volcanic eruption at Mount Toba about 74,000 years
150960	154680	ago and how this might have impacted human populations.
154680	159560	But what I want you to get a sense of is this is just one small part of what he does.
159560	164040	Really Dr. Ambrose's research interest range from everything from African archaeology from
164040	168040	the Iron Age to quite recent periods to the sort of deepest early Stone Age.
168040	172880	He's done work on Miocene apes, interests in the study of modern human origins more
172880	179120	broadly, paleoecology, human diet, using isotopes in particular, looking at sites from China,
179120	182720	Kenya, stone tool analysis, language, the evolution of cooperation.
182720	186880	The list really does go on for quite some time.
186880	190840	Looking at these topics, answering these questions have taken him to field sites in
190840	196640	Kenya, Ethiopia, India, and Australia, and I'm sure other places as we might learn.
196640	200080	His work has been published widely in things such as the Journal of Archaeological Science
200080	201080	or Nature.
201080	204160	He's published a number of co-authored books as well.
204160	207680	And perhaps not surprisingly, his research has been well funded by the National Science
207680	213920	Foundation in particular, recognizing his repeated innovative research projects.
213920	217360	So the list of accomplishments could go on for quite some time.
217360	220640	But I'd like to notice sort of a personal note that I've known Stan for about 15 years
220640	221640	now.
221640	225440	And during that time, I've often drawn on his sort of encyclopedic knowledge and I think
225440	228680	a particularly good skill of knowing a good idea from a bad idea.
228680	231960	And he's helped me sort of pursue the good ideas and not the bad ones quite often in
231960	232960	the past.
232960	233960	For that, I thank him.
233960	236600	So with that, please join me in welcoming Dr. Stanley Ambrose.
236600	250040	Well, thank you, Christian, for that generous introduction.
250040	251800	I don't know if I deserve all of it.
251800	254560	I hope my voice carries.
254560	257520	I've got a bit of a rough throat.
257520	260080	I should open up this water bottle.
260080	271040	Thank you all for coming and especially Professor Moevious's children here.
271040	276480	I never got to meet Professor Moevious, but I feel like I should know him.
276480	282040	I mention him in almost every class I teach.
282040	287720	And he's on my exams.
287720	297800	And well, there'll be no exam after tonight's talk, but I'm going to move widely.
297800	305200	I was looking at something that he wrote in 1948 and he actually mentions the volcanic
305200	308680	ash from the eruption that I'll be talking about tonight.
308680	316320	So this is something that was well known.
316320	318080	Can everybody hear me all right?
318080	320560	Okay, good.
320560	321920	Let's see where we're going.
321920	330600	Well, first of all, Kano in winter in erupting, this is up in the Kamchatka Peninsula.
330600	338440	And I'm going to talk about a much larger eruption than this and how it affected population
338440	343800	history and I'll try to explain to you how we go about identifying population history
343800	350560	from the genes and how the consequences of this eruption may have changed the environment
350560	358960	in ways that favored a new pathway, a new direction in human evolution.
358960	365480	And I like to call this new direction the troop to tribe transition.
365480	375360	I'd like to just define troops and tribes for you in the way that fits my real interests.
375360	380560	A lot of people around the world are very interested in the evolution of cooperation.
380560	387920	There are people on Harvard University campus writing books about how evolution favors cooperation.
387920	391720	I would disagree that it always favors cooperation.
391720	396280	We know about competition, there's a lot of writing about competition.
396280	401040	If we think about most of our primate relatives, they live in what we call troops that live
401040	402920	in closed territories.
402920	408620	They may have tightly knit cooperative, sometimes not so cooperative relationships within their
408620	414200	troop and on a regular basis they go to the boundaries of their territories and they make
414200	421480	noises and in the case of chimpanzees, they may actually look for lone troop members from
421480	424680	the adjacent troop and try to kill them.
424680	429360	Richard Rangham has written extensively about this, Professor Rangham here in the Anthropology
429360	430720	Department.
430720	437520	So the question is, to what extent did we have in our past a troop-like kind of organization
437520	441200	and when did we really break out of it?
441200	444920	We may not have broken out of it entirely.
444920	451880	So small, closed, defended territories is what I think of as troops.
451880	458400	Human tribes have regional networks of communities that people visit, they have relationships
458400	463200	between them, they can go out and visit and they can come home again.
463200	468560	Most primates are on a one-way trip and I'll talk about one exception later.
468560	470680	We have positive relationships.
470680	476120	We have names for people in other groups, sometimes they're fictional names.
476120	482000	We can talk about brothers in arms and these are important human innovation to be able
482000	488440	to make a symbolic name for something and then behave as if they are your brother or
488440	492840	your sister or your uncle, so forth.
492840	498920	Now modern hunter-gatherers in arid and risky environments tend to have the greatest extent
498960	503840	of their social networks.
503840	508600	This could contrast with some agricultural communities, many of them who live in very
508600	516960	stable environments, do you think of the Yanamamo in South American forests or Papua New Guinea?
516960	523400	To call them tribes is being contested by John Yellen and Henry Harpending who are also
523400	529560	of Harvard University here and they wrote about this in World Archaeology.
529560	534920	They didn't use the troop to try distinction, it's very hard to actually find mention of
534920	539560	this in the literature, but when we teach our anthropology courses and evolution courses
539560	544920	we always talk about primate troops and then we talk about two and a half million year
544920	550120	old stone tool using meat-eating groups.
550120	558500	To what extent did they have an intergroup favorable reciprocal relationships?
558500	564080	This question came to me in the middle of a lecture and then I realized that maybe it
564080	570320	wasn't as far back in time as we would necessarily assume.
570320	575840	So let's talk about volcanoes and a little bit of art.
575840	583120	This is Turner, I haven't seen the movie yet, I don't think it got any Oscars.
583120	592640	But in 1815, Tambora erupted in between Java and Sumatra, I think it was, and the skies
592640	599160	turned gloomy for several years, 1816 was a year without a summer.
599160	606120	These amazing sunsets and the atmospherics were incredible, it looks like Beijing where
606120	614840	I was about two months ago in the bottom one, pretty thick air.
614840	623800	A lot of things happened in that summer and Lord Byron with his guests at his summer home
623800	630360	on the shores of Lake Geneva wrote, this is just a little excerpt from his poem, the bright
630360	635720	sun was extinguished and the stars did wander, darkling in the eternal space, I won't read
635720	640880	the whole thing, it goes quite a long time and it gets more dismal and there's death
640880	641880	in it.
641880	651360	And one of his house guests was Mary Shelley and Mary Shelley created this story then.
651360	657800	I won't attribute it entirely to the volcano.
657800	665680	This is what happens to the atmosphere when a large low latitude, high explosive eruption
665680	670320	occurs that has a lot of sulfur gases in the mix.
670320	677760	This was Pinatubo and you can see the distribution of the sulfur gas as it went around the world
677760	678960	over 12 weeks.
678960	688600	It was the largest sulfur exhalation and it went up about 20 miles into the stratosphere
688600	697920	and spread around the world for a couple of years at least, there was a one degree temperature
697920	706200	drop, Tambora was quite a bit more severe with a larger eruption.
706200	714960	Now I got involved with this when I saw this paper that was published in Nature in 1992
714960	726640	by Michael Rampino and Steven Self and they proposed that the eruption of Toba in Sumatra,
726640	733960	73, 74,000 years ago, it's the largest crater lake in the world right now, produced enough
734960	740840	sulfuric acid that was in the stratosphere to reflect sunlight for five to six years
740840	745920	and cause a volcanic winter just like the nuclear winter scenarios that were popular
745920	751320	in the 80s and they're still being modeled and considered.
751320	757880	Billions of tons of sulfur were ejected into the stratosphere according to them and it
757880	765320	may have initiated the last glacial era at 70,000 years ago.
765320	771600	The climate records were not very detailed then but that was the idea.
771600	777560	They become much more detailed and we'll look at some of them and the volcanic ash was found,
777560	783640	here's Toba down here, volcanic ash was found halfway across the Indian Ocean.
783640	787280	One of my mentors at Berkeley in grad school was Desmond Clark.
787280	794400	He went to India in 1980 and 81, 82 with a little team when they couldn't go to Ethiopia
794400	801520	to find early hominids and early archaeological sites and Martin Williams, who I've worked
801520	810440	with in India and in Kenya and in Australia now, found a volcanic ash layer halfway across
810440	817280	India and it turned out to correlate and it looks like India was covered with at least
817280	820200	10 centimeters of volcanic ash.
820200	824240	We'll talk a little bit more about that later.
824240	826000	How big was the eruption?
826000	832480	The eruption happened new date 73,880 years ago.
832480	834960	That's a nice date.
834960	841760	When I saw the talk that this table came from, I was about to fall asleep and then I saw
841760	846800	that Toba produced 800 cubic kilometers.
846800	855800	The estimate was in 1990, 1992, 800 cubic kilometers of rock blasted into the atmosphere
855800	861520	and the total eruptive volume has been estimated to be 2,700 cubic kilometers.
861520	863880	That's a lot.
863880	871960	So that was in 1992 and by the year 2002, the ash had been found, I think, out into
871960	876400	the Arabian Sea.
876400	882400	So it was getting bigger as more research was being done.
882400	886480	There's Yellowstone at about the same scale for comparison.
886480	890240	The eruptions, the super eruptions from Yellowstone.
890240	895760	Now by 2008, they started thinking it was even bigger and you can see Pinatubo's ash
895760	901720	fall area and Tambora the year without a summer.
901720	904960	That looks pretty big.
904960	912920	In 2012, ash was discovered and chemically fingerprinted fairly precisely.
912920	918360	In two cores drilled into the muds in the bottom of Lake Malawi.
918400	923720	That gets us to about 21 million kilometers square and probably closer to 2,000 cubic
923720	927160	kilometers of a dense rock equivalent.
927160	932000	Even out here in the Indian Ocean, about the same distance as across the United States,
932000	934760	it was up to 34 centimeters thick.
934760	939440	That's a little bit more than a foot thick, 14 inches.
939440	940440	That's amazing.
940440	945360	The Yellowstone ash has never been found east of the Mississippi despite the prevailing
945360	947320	winds.
948080	950200	It's getting bigger.
950200	958520	In April last year, it was reported all the way down there in the south coast of South
958520	960520	Africa.
960520	968640	Near the bottom of a sand layer that occurs for maybe 100 miles along the coast.
968640	973600	This wind-blown sand layer seems to represent an interesting climatic event.
973600	980440	I'll come back to the cultural changes that seem to be marked by this sand layer.
980440	984720	The search is now really on for finding this ash just about everywhere.
984720	992520	It's hard to find it because it's little individual cryptic shards of glass.
992520	995680	But there's no volcanoes in South Africa.
995680	1001360	They can be chemically fingerprinted with microscopic techniques.
1001440	1006920	Here's the, this is called the two-mile time machine.
1006920	1014080	Every core that's drilled into the ice in the Arctic can go down about two miles before
1014080	1019840	the ice gets very deformed and you lose a detailed climate record.
1019840	1022280	But you can get annual layering.
1022280	1024240	This is the second mile down.
1024240	1028520	The first mile covers 10,000 years of a Greenland ice core.
1028520	1036440	Second mile covers 110,000, 120,000 years.
1036440	1042840	When the curve goes down, we're looking at low oxygen isotope ratios.
1042840	1043840	That's cold.
1043840	1046760	When it goes up, we're looking at warm.
1046760	1051280	The last 10,000 years, 12,000 years is just at the top of the graph and it stays that
1051280	1052840	way to the present.
1052840	1058440	A warm wet period where ice is accumulated rapidly.
1059440	1066480	What's interesting is that Toba produced enough sulfuric acid to leave a very large
1066480	1074920	patch of a very acidic ice, sulfuric acid, haze that finally precipitated out.
1074920	1077800	And it was already in an ice age.
1077800	1085600	So we can get a simple answer to Rampino and Self's question, did it cause the last
1085600	1086600	ice age?
1086720	1089920	The last ice age was pretty much all the way there.
1089920	1093600	However, it went a little further.
1093600	1102200	So these ups and downs, pairs of them are called Greenland events and there, the S stands
1102200	1104080	for stadial.
1104080	1107360	There's a little I there that stands for interstadial.
1107360	1111280	The I's are warm, the S's are cold.
1111280	1113400	So that's the interstadial, stadial.
1113400	1115680	And that was stadial 20.
1115680	1122800	Now it definitely did not cause the last ice age because after 1800 years of the coldest,
1122800	1130720	temperatures recorded in 123,000 years worth of ice, it got abruptly warm, 16 degrees Celsius,
1130720	1134880	that's about 27 degrees Fahrenheit, increase in warmth.
1134880	1142320	So again, this eruption may have done something to exacerbate the cold here, make it the coldest
1142320	1148280	of one of these instant ice ages, and that's what I call them, lasted 1800 years, but didn't
1148280	1149960	cause the last ice age.
1149960	1157600	Last ice age then came, and it's from about 70,000 to 60,000 years ago.
1157600	1165240	That's a long time for almost unrelenting cold, a few little blips of warm, and that's
1165240	1169840	the last glacial maximum as it's commonly known when the mammoth hunters were killing
1169840	1171720	off the last of the woolly mammoths.
1172160	1178800	It was colder, it was a tough time, and the people weren't as technologically sophisticated
1178800	1182880	or so we may think back then.
1182880	1189120	So I call that marine isotope, I don't call that, it's been called marine isotope stage 4.
1189120	1196000	This is marine isotope stage 5, a predominantly warm and wet period.
1196000	1201760	But this is the flickering switch of last glacial climate.
1201760	1209360	This is a stage of predominantly cold, stage 3 is predominantly warm, stage 2 sort of dips
1209360	1215640	down into what we call the last glacial maximum, and then the last 10,000 years is warm.
1215640	1228240	So Toba erupted after the onset of one of these instant ice ages, and you could argue
1228240	1232640	that it made it the coldest and stayed cold.
1232640	1239080	So if we look in detail at it, we can see the sulfur in centimeter by centimeter of
1239080	1253760	the ice at a depth of about 2,591.05 meters, that's about two miles down.
1253760	1259160	And that's the most sulfur in the core, so whoops, going backwards.
1259160	1263800	I thought this was an arrow pointing to where the sulfur spike was, but it's actually the
1263800	1268760	height of the sulfur spike, and it's six years wide.
1268760	1271360	And there's more later.
1271360	1279280	Dust increases dramatically as well during this 1,800 year period, and then dust drops
1279280	1287320	away when that warm period comes, interstitial 19, and then we go for 10,000 years of that
1287320	1294360	very cold period with lots more dust, very little vegetation to hold the soil down, very
1294360	1297360	cold at that time.
1297360	1299760	This is just a bit of a detail on it.
1299760	1306920	So this is just to emphasize that the eruption didn't cause a cold period, but I think it
1306920	1310480	may have exacerbated it.
1310480	1314160	Now I've done some research in India, as I mentioned.
1314160	1323200	This is the Saan River, Narmada, and that's near Rajasthan, volcanic ash has been found
1323200	1328280	in many, many more places than this, but these are places that I've done work on the volcanic
1328280	1329280	ash.
1329280	1336520	This is where Toba is, and I'll just show you a few of these places.
1336520	1341360	This is the type site where Martin Williams, with his grad student, Royce, they came upon
1341360	1348200	that pale layer there, and Martin said to Royce, if this was Ethiopia, that would be
1348200	1349640	a volcanic ash.
1349640	1353480	I'd better take a double sample, and he did.
1353480	1362960	Then we came back when I developed my specialty of analyzing soils, and we cleared off a nice
1362960	1366080	section and sampled.
1366080	1375480	That's Parth Chauhan, and part of our team there, and I'm working with him elsewhere.
1375480	1377680	He's at about the top of the volcanic ash.
1377680	1384440	It's a little bit brown here, a little bit upriver.
1384440	1391800	The ash actually is pretty pure down to the bottom, gets reworked, and the soil is ashy
1391800	1393480	all the way up to there.
1393480	1397880	That's my behind.
1397880	1400920	Sampling the soils for analysis.
1400920	1402880	There's a close up of the ash.
1402880	1409720	It's bright white, 10 centimeters across India, and probably elsewhere.
1409720	1415200	You know what happens when bright white stuff falls on the ground around here?
1415200	1417820	This doesn't melt.
1417820	1419080	It reflects sunlight.
1419080	1420680	That's called albedo.
1420680	1423160	It's reflectance.
1423160	1425680	Ice and snow have high reflectance.
1425680	1432120	This bright white ash could have helped the cooling.
1432120	1439120	The aerosol, parasol gas, so to speak, the fine mist that was ejected, the sulfuric
1439120	1444560	acid is white, makes a white haze that is an effective reflector of sunlight.
1444560	1449080	That's why big volcanic eruptions cause global cooling.
1449080	1453440	They have to be low latitudes because that's where most of the sunlight falls to really
1453440	1456600	have an impact.
1456600	1460280	October was low latitude.
1460280	1465600	Chemical fingerprint was distinctive and identified all over the place.
1465600	1474040	One of the things I do is I analyze the carbon in soils, not the carbon-14, the carbon-13,
1474040	1482520	which is not radioactive, and it's ratioed to the common carbon, carbon-12.
1482520	1489880	Here has given us a nice natural label, like a tracer that, in biomedicine, they'd give
1489880	1491360	you a radioactive tracer.
1491360	1495040	There's a natural tracer.
1495040	1498960	These are low 13C content plants.
1498960	1505560	They include trees and shrubs and rice and wheat and potatoes and non-tropical grasses.
1505560	1510680	These are called C4 plants, and they have much higher carbon-13 content, and there's
1510680	1518440	nothing in between, and they are mainly tropical grasses.
1518440	1525960	If we have a warm forest in the tropics and it's wet, we get 13C values of the soil that
1525960	1527480	look like this.
1527480	1534160	If it's a dry open grassland, we get 13C values that look like this in the organic carbon.
1534160	1538720	Calcium carbonate, the same stuff that chalk and limestone is made out of, forms in the
1538720	1543960	soil, and it also acquires the carbon isotope ratios of the plants.
1543960	1554480	That is offset by 14, so we can move the numbers here to be 14 for 100% woody plants, herbs,
1554480	1562280	trees, forest, and somewhere around zero to a little bit more for grasses.
1562280	1568280	I've done some analyses at three sites, and these are three separate sites in their graphs.
1568320	1575600	I've shown you these two, and that's 500 centimeters above the base of the ash, and then it goes
1575600	1582560	down to about 200 centimeters below the ash.
1582560	1587040	Each of these graphs goes from trees to grass.
1587040	1593720	Let's see if I've got that labeled here.
1593720	1594720	There we are.
1594720	1599880	These are all of the sites where we excavated and sampled soils.
1599880	1605680	The carbon isotope ratio of the soils underneath the ash showed forest.
1605680	1609920	One exception, that one bit.
1609920	1615800	Inside the ash and near the top of the ash, whoops, going the wrong way.
1615800	1616800	This helps.
1616800	1622320	13C values shifted up with more grass.
1622320	1631960	This really long section stayed with lots of grass for a considerable time, maybe 2,000
1631960	1632960	years.
1632960	1635200	We don't know exactly.
1635200	1641520	Soils above the ash supported C4, grassy woodland to grassland.
1641520	1651440	Put simply, the eruption fell on a very forested landscape, over 400 kilometers that we sampled,
1652240	1656040	and after the eruption, there was grassland.
1656040	1660560	Central India was deforested by the Toba eruption.
1660560	1664520	Now, what are some of the broader impacts?
1664520	1674200	We can go to the fossil record closer to Toba, Southeast Asia, and Lois has identified about
1674200	1680760	11 or 12 large mammal extinctions, either total extinctions or regional extinctions.
1680760	1686760	What really is interesting to me is that orangutans used to live on mainland Southeast Asia.
1686760	1691560	Their last appearance date is somewhere around the time of Toba.
1691560	1694600	Orangutans really don't do well on the ground.
1694600	1703560	They have four arms, they don't really have legs, and that's just one of the species.
1703560	1706960	He says it's not significant.
1706960	1710120	That's 12 more extinctions than I've ever said happened.
1710120	1714560	Now, let's switch from the paleontology and talk about genetics.
1714560	1721360	As long ago as 1972, the geneticists studying the patterns of genetic diversity observed
1721360	1729640	that there wasn't enough genetic diversity in humans alive today to account for the amount
1729640	1733320	of time we've had a fossil record of humanity.
1733320	1739200	And John Hay and John Maynard Smith proposed that about five times the age of the origins
1739200	1744440	of agriculture, which gets us to about 60,000 to 70,000 years old, there was a long period
1744440	1750440	of very low population size where much of the genetic diversity was lost.
1750440	1755160	And there have been a small number of mutations accumulating since that period that differentiate
1755160	1756160	people.
1756160	1764000	But most of the mutations that we should see, the genetic diversity we should see, is missing.
1764000	1765000	So that was a mystery.
1765000	1768040	It goes all the way back to 1972.
1768040	1773080	So this just happens to be a period from when Toba, all the way up through marine isotope
1773080	1779200	stage four, that early glacial maximum, they didn't know anything about this.
1779200	1786720	Now, this is how geneticists just pretend I'm a tree, okay?
1786720	1791760	I had to give a talk once where I had no graphics and I just, you know, nothing to show on.
1791760	1795720	And I said, well, just pretend, imagine I'm a tree.
1795720	1797480	This is a tree that's growing.
1797480	1799720	It's not lost any branches.
1799720	1804440	And the lineages, so to speak, each branch has survived for a very long time.
1804440	1809520	So to get back to the common ancestor of this tips of the branches and those tips of the
1809520	1811720	branches, you have to go way down to the trunk.
1811720	1815440	It's down in the lower garden there.
1815440	1817640	It's in Kenya, but it's a tree from India.
1817640	1819760	It makes a lovely shade.
1819760	1826440	This is a jacaranda that was trimmed and it's got three main trunks.
1826440	1834200	It once had long branches, but now with the decimation, new sprouts have come up all at
1834200	1835400	about the same time.
1835400	1840440	Now, we can imagine if a human population or any animal species or even plant species
1840440	1850920	population is reduced to a small number, then they become the progenitors of everybody afterwards.
1850920	1855960	And if you measure the length of these, you can say from this branch tip to that branch
1855960	1864720	tip divided by two, knowing the growth rate gets us back to about the time of the chopping.
1864720	1868800	And then to get to another main trunk, you have to go much further.
1868800	1871520	This is the picture of Africa, actually.
1871520	1879520	There's a lot of different main branches and subdivisions that all coalesce to large trunks
1879520	1886720	and then the large branches coalesce to a main trunk.
1886720	1893520	On one of these side branches here, two of these wisps account for everybody outside
1893520	1894520	of Africa.
1894520	1897000	I'll show you that.
1897000	1898640	But let's do a little simulation here.
1898640	1908120	I'm going to teach you how we can turn a theoretical family tree, one ancestor, two ancestors,
1908880	1916360	and then these four sisters, if we can say these are females, give rise all at about
1916360	1922280	the same time, maybe when the climate got good, to a bunch of people, lineages that
1922280	1923560	have survived to the present.
1923560	1929000	Each of these little X's would be a mutation along a lineage that differentiates them.
1929000	1933480	And you could cut up the number of mutational units that separate this person from the other
1933520	1940680	49 and do these pairwise comparisons and then calculate some statistics and get a frequency
1940680	1944080	distribution of the number of pairwise differences.
1944080	1950760	If there was a population explosion at seven mutational units of time in the past, then
1950760	1955200	you get this kind of a hump, wave-like distribution.
1955200	1960960	So population expansions make waves that look like this.
1961000	1963800	Let's look at some humans and apes.
1963800	1969120	So if the expansion was recent, there might only be instead of seven site differences,
1969120	1970800	there might be two or three.
1970800	1977520	And we could call this a rake-like expansion of rake-like family tree, but with short times
1977520	1981560	means a recent expansion.
1981560	1988040	Only a few mutations have accumulated in all the lineages from the ancestral lineage.
1988040	1992800	If it was further back in time, we would get longer tines on the rake, and there would
1992800	1996720	be little sub-tines poking out.
1996720	1999720	Okay.
1999720	2008480	So here we have three branches within the western chimpanzees that have exploded at about the
2008480	2009960	same time.
2009960	2012440	So we could call these clades or branches.
2012440	2018920	So we have three nested clades within the western chimpanzees.
2018920	2022880	They coalesce back to Nigerians.
2022880	2026280	Eastern chimpanzees have one big expansion.
2026280	2028680	Central chimpanzees don't look like they expanded.
2028680	2033680	There have been stable populations that have had lineages that have survived for a long
2033680	2034680	time.
2034680	2038360	This is 811 humans from around the world.
2038360	2044920	Not much genetic diversity at all, less than the eastern chimpanzees.
2044920	2051040	And here's where Neanderthals fit in.
2051040	2052040	Okay.
2052040	2059480	So eastern chimpanzees, which live in the most ecologically sensitive areas, most likely
2059480	2065680	to get their forests dried up during ice ages, have the smallest genetic diversity among
2065680	2070000	the chimps, almost like humans.
2070000	2074880	And here's what it looks like when we turn it into that wave-like distribution, the frequency
2074880	2075880	distribution.
2075880	2078600	Modern humans almost know genetic diversity.
2078600	2083400	Eastern chimpanzees, an interesting little bump here, won't have time to talk about that.
2083400	2090240	Central, Nigerian, western chimpanzees, gorillas.
2090240	2098360	So we look like we're missing most of our genetic diversity around the world.
2098360	2105000	If we compare different human populations, take the nested clade approach, we can see
2105000	2115400	that the people in Africa that belong to a maternal group that's been called L has the
2115400	2119880	greatest number of genetic differences among people.
2119880	2130520	If we compare people from southern, eastern Asia, Australasia, including Australians and
2130520	2138080	Melanesians and so forth, they have slightly more genetic diversity than northern Eurasians.
2138080	2144280	And we can put a time of the beginning of the expansion, this peak here, in terms of
2144280	2150360	number of mutational units and how much time it took those mutations to accumulate.
2150360	2157800	This is about 70, 60, and 50,000 years ago.
2157800	2160000	So that's an interesting thing.
2160000	2167480	Populations expanding sometime about after Toba erupts, and then these populations are
2167480	2177040	expanding out of Africa at the end of that very cold marine isotope stage four that was
2177040	2181000	very cold from 70 to 60.
2181000	2189960	So the reconstruction that's been made of this is that people out of this subgroup of
2189960	2197080	the L lineage went across the south end of the Red Sea, the Babel Mandeb Straits called
2197080	2205680	the Gates of Tears, and another subpopulation of this L3 went out across the Sinai.
2205680	2210680	And the ones that went out across the Sinai we call N subgroup, and the ones that went
2210680	2219960	out across the south end of the Red Sea are in the M subgroup of the L3 of East Africa.
2219960	2223600	Now they originated in East Africa.
2223640	2231560	The most diverse branches of these M's and N's are in Kenya, Tanzania, and Ethiopia.
2231560	2235240	So everybody outside of Africa is not just an African.
2235240	2238840	They're an East African.
2238840	2244920	Very different from the West African L0s, 1s, and 2s.
2244920	2249040	So this is the whole family tree on the maternal DNA.
2249040	2251640	Goes back to 200,000 years.
2251680	2255480	Here's our L3 and a little bit of L4.
2255480	2261520	And these two little subbranches of L3 are the non-Africans.
2261520	2268080	There's more genetic difference between individuals in a single African village than there is
2268080	2278200	between people from Asia, Japan, all the way to Iceland, from Australia to Iceland.
2279200	2280200	Okay.
2280200	2285520	Oh, yeah, one more thing about this.
2285520	2291600	Lots of lineages, these are major lineages, were founded in this period around 80,000
2291600	2294320	to 70,000, 60,000 years ago.
2294320	2297280	The genetic dating is not very tight.
2297280	2299320	It's got big error margins.
2299320	2305120	So other populations, other species that have gone through population expansions from small
2305120	2310920	sizes include chimpanzees, the Eastern chimpanzees, lowland gorillas.
2310920	2318040	Nuclear DNA was shared between West Africa and East Africa.
2318040	2322480	Eastern and Western lowland gorillas are presently separated by thousands of miles.
2322480	2326480	They were exchanging genes 77,000 years ago.
2326480	2329440	Big surprise.
2329440	2333960	Gorillas have a bottleneck around 70,000 or expansion.
2333960	2337680	Macaque monkeys in central India, about 55,000 years.
2337680	2346280	All tigers on earth have one lucky mother, 73,000 years ago, according to the geneticists
2346280	2348320	Luo.
2348320	2356880	And ancient DNA tells us about cave bears in their population history and Neanderthals.
2356880	2358400	That was a big surprise.
2358440	2360080	Let's look at Neanderthals.
2360080	2362240	First we'll just look at orangutans.
2362240	2365560	So there's fossil orangutans that gone.
2365560	2372400	Let's compare Borneo to Sumatra and orangutan genetics.
2372400	2378480	There, that's a garden rate that looks like it's been worn down to a stub.
2378480	2382720	Hardly any distance between all of the individuals, genetic distance.
2382720	2387400	So the length of these teeth is practically zero.
2387400	2392440	And it turns into this pair-wise frequency of just a few differences.
2392440	2402840	The Sumatran ones, it's a funny way of drawing it, but to go from this patch of orangutan
2402840	2408040	DNA sequences to that one, you have to go all the way back to there.
2408040	2412320	And they're the ones that are scattered out here with many genetic differences between
2412320	2414240	pairs of individuals.
2414240	2417360	So let's look at Neanderthals.
2417360	2423200	This paper was published in Science, well this is just the cover story.
2423200	2430920	Neanderthal bones and their DNA has been giving up their DNA for a couple of decades now.
2430920	2435760	And some of them now go off this map.
2435760	2438160	And this covers Western Europe.
2438160	2446400	These are all Neanderthals that died, radiocarbon dated somewhere around 40, 45,000 years ago.
2446440	2450880	East Toba eruption.
2450880	2454640	The ones that have yielded their DNA, these are all very closely related.
2454640	2459000	And you can see Africans here for comparison.
2459000	2463440	Very deep branches in the African DNA, there's our L3.
2463440	2470160	And you can see that the M and N are just subsets of the whole L3, non-Africans.
2470160	2478040	So we are all East Africans unless we're from West Africa or South Africa.
2478040	2483080	So this paper was published in 2012 with more DNA sequences.
2483080	2487680	And you can see this short-time garden rake kind of distribution.
2487680	2490280	They're dead by about 40,000.
2490280	2498840	Their common maternal ancestor for all of them in Western Europe lived 60,000 years ago.
2499320	2503160	Coincidentally, the end of that very cold period.
2503160	2505400	Marine isotope stage four.
2505400	2507440	So this population expanded.
2507440	2511880	There are the dates, it's maybe hard to see.
2511880	2513840	And they lived for 20,000 years.
2513840	2520920	It was about 43,000 years ago when people from Africa made it that far into Western Europe.
2520920	2527640	So Western Europe was depopulated according to the geneticists.
2527640	2535880	Sometime in the early last Ice Age and repopulated 60,000 years ago.
2535880	2539120	I kind of like this.
2539120	2541160	What were Neanderthals like?
2541160	2543920	How well did they behave?
2543920	2547440	Everything you thought about them was true.
2547440	2550560	And that includes me.
2550600	2558480	I found out when I graduated high school that I was Neanderthal man, Newton high.
2558480	2564600	Okay, the fossil record of them, the archaeological record of them is not pretty.
2564600	2568760	There's lots of interpersonal violence and trauma.
2568760	2576720	This is a painting from reconstruction of what was going on at Krapina in Croatia.
2576720	2581680	Where they had 49 individuals, most of whom were butchered.
2581680	2584480	He's cradling somebody's head in his lap.
2584480	2587400	This one's breaking open the femur.
2587400	2593320	This guy's chewing on another long bone of one of his neighbors.
2593320	2594640	We're very nice to each other.
2594640	2602840	Most archaeological sites have little scraps of Neanderthal bone that have traces of burning cut marks and hammer marks on them.
2602840	2604760	You don't hear about most of these.
2604800	2616760	You hear about the full skeletons that are severely arthritic, traumatized, healed bones, broken bones, re-healed, lots of nasty stuff.
2616760	2618200	Cannibalism.
2618200	2627360	They used stone tools that you would imagine you could find, not just imagine, you can find the geological sources.
2627360	2636200	Within the home range of a hunter-gatherer in a relatively rich territory.
2636200	2640720	They don't look like they were planning their predation very well.
2640720	2644840	The arguments about how much they scavenged versus hunted.
2644840	2651080	They had small home ranges by the stone tool site to source distances.
2651080	2655600	They engaged in strenuous activities for most of the day.
2655600	2657480	Giving them all this arthritis.
2657480	2658760	They had short lifespans.
2658760	2663400	It's been argued that they didn't live long enough to be grandparents.
2663400	2668080	And that's important for social learning, I think, and for survival.
2668080	2674160	They carried around stone tools that archaeologists loved to classify.
2674160	2680960	And I'm a primary practitioner of Professor Movious's craft and skill.
2680960	2688040	So I know just how disappointing some of these tool kits can be, the early ones,
2688040	2694040	because it's easier to say what they did to a rock than what you call it.
2694040	2704080	Later in time, you can look at artifacts and say, ah, that's a type 22, no doubt about it.
2704080	2706120	They seem to have been strongly territorial.
2706120	2709360	Were they like chimpanzee troops?
2709360	2710520	That's the question.
2710520	2715600	Now, let's look at some of the archaeology I've done just very briefly.
2715600	2720200	I've been working in Kenya for a long time, about 40 years.
2720200	2723840	These two areas are lots of fun.
2723840	2727760	This is one of the sites in the southern area along the Intuka River.
2727760	2731520	And down here at the bottom, there's a volcanic ash you can't really see.
2731520	2733880	It's not the Tobash.
2733880	2737160	It's about 52,000 years down there.
2737160	2740960	We get some of these large, generalized, all-purpose tools,
2740960	2748280	like this large spearhead-sized, big knife thing, and little small blade segments.
2748280	2755520	Very sharp obsidian volcanic glass comes from about 70, 80 kilometers away.
2755520	2756760	These are all-purpose tools.
2756760	2765320	These are highly specialized, displacable, replaceable, disposable things.
2765880	2768720	The big ones are a jack-of-all-trades kind of tool.
2768720	2775920	And we can see the rise after a quarter million years ago to about 105,000 years ago.
2775920	2780800	Suddenly, in the last Ice Age, we start to see lots of this obsidian,
2780800	2787480	which is coming from quite a distance, 60 to 100 kilometers from the archaeological sites,
2787480	2794800	shooting up to as much as 65% of the artifacts in the bottom of that section I just showed you.
2794800	2797960	That means a lot of interaction over long distances.
2801160	2806520	In South Africa, in that site where the volcanic ash was found at Pinnacle Point,
2806520	2812640	directly above the sand layer, we find the same kinds of blade segments,
2812640	2820040	the disposable, sharp, easily replaceable, thin, fragile tools.
2820040	2826080	They're replacing these thick, robust tools that you could use for all kinds of circumstances.
2826080	2832320	I've made the argument that these are very effective because they're very sharp.
2832320	2834200	They're easy to replace.
2834200	2839160	You can make specialized toolkits, and you can bring along the right replacement parts
2839160	2842800	if you've planned out your day, your activities.
2842800	2847160	Neanderthals, Stephen Kuhn at the University of Arizona said,
2847160	2850200	their toolkits look like they were planning for the unanticipated,
2850200	2857760	planning for the unplanned, big tools that they could modify as needed when they encountered something.
2857760	2861400	So that's quite different.
2861400	2865600	Well, that's enough archaeology for now.
2865600	2868400	How do we survive?
2868400	2870120	Why did Neanderthals die out?
2870120	2872960	That's the real important question here.
2873920	2877320	I'm sorry.
2877320	2881280	I can't think of Neanderthals after looking at the totality of the evidence
2881280	2887520	that they were much different than Mad Max beyond Thunderdown.
2887520	2893840	Tina Turner, Mel Gibson, well, I won't say anything about Mel,
2893840	2902640	but he's got that kind of reactionary us against them kind of mentality.
2902640	2905880	So Neanderthals faced off to modern humans.
2905880	2907720	What was the advantage?
2907720	2910800	They're obviously a lot stronger than us.
2914800	2921040	I think that humans before Tova didn't have this long-distance transport
2921040	2925400	of the archaeological materials that show that they got outside of their home ranges
2925400	2927760	and came home again very often.
2927760	2930520	There's small amounts, but not a lot.
2930520	2933240	And I would say they were more cooperative afterwards.
2933240	2934680	Neanderthals never were.
2934680	2940320	Last archaeological sites made by Neanderthals look like the one the quarter million years ago.
2940320	2943760	The archaeologists who work on these throw up their hands and say,
2943760	2946520	well, they just didn't change.
2946520	2948080	It didn't matter what the climate was.
2948080	2953560	And it must have been just the right thing, you know, like bacteria.
2953560	2955720	They've really worked it out.
2955720	2957720	They've got the all-purpose toolkit.
2957720	2966040	Now, I think that one of the most important things about modern people is
2966040	2968760	that they have these social relationships.
2968760	2973200	And they cement these ties with gifts and symbolic things.
2973200	2975920	I'm wearing some beads now that were a gift.
2975920	2981280	This woman is wearing her social capital, 25 Bushman exchange partners
2981280	2983960	that she's had for most of her life.
2983960	2990400	And this just is a marker that she has friends she's trusting.
2990400	2995800	She cooperates, she reciprocates, she gives as much as she receives.
2995800	2999680	These are the kinds of people you want in a tough environment
2999680	3001560	where you're all in the lifeboat.
3001560	3002960	This is really important.
3002960	3005320	We see she's wearing a lot of ostrich egg shell beads.
3005320	3007080	They go back 50,000 years.
3007080	3008520	I've dug up these.
3008520	3013640	They're older than 40,000 years old in the Kenya Rift Valley.
3013640	3017440	And these simple little things, they're really tiny.
3017440	3021240	That's a one-inch pin down there for scale.
3021240	3024960	May have been the first formal tokens.
3024960	3029120	I called them small things remembered.
3029120	3032840	Let's just move this over here.
3032840	3036840	And these people have these chains of relationships.
3036840	3039840	The attitude that lots of archaeologists have when they look
3039840	3045720	at the archaeological record is that it's always us versus them,
3045720	3047720	a zero-sum game.
3047720	3048640	But there's a new math.
3052600	3056920	If I give to you, it's not my loss.
3056920	3058160	I'm multiplying.
3058160	3061680	If two people cooperate, one person
3061680	3064880	may just be able to feed themself and their family maybe.
3064880	3066920	Two people, three people cooperating.
3066920	3070120	They can feed the whole camp.
3070120	3075000	So 1 plus 1 may equal 3, 4, or 5.
3075000	3078320	There's no negative in reciprocity.
3078320	3081280	But if you cheat, you may get shunned.
3081280	3088400	So rather than your gain is my loss,
3088400	3089920	we might want to think about Yates.
3092640	3095400	And I think this is a way they thought about the world, and they do.
3097040	3099840	They go out of their way to try to make new relationships with people.
3099840	3100640	Here, take this.
3100640	3101880	It's a gift.
3101880	3104120	I want you to have it.
3104120	3108600	This was told to me by Ed Wilmson, who worked among the Bushmen.
3108600	3109280	It's yours.
3109280	3110320	I want you to have it.
3110320	3111320	Don't you forget it.
3115360	3119480	So that's where we are.
3119480	3123560	I would argue that during the really tough times brought on
3123560	3127760	by this Toba eruption, especially the first 1,800 years,
3127760	3132400	people in Africa worked out systems of reciprocity, trust,
3132400	3136400	and cooperation that Neanderthals never did.
3136400	3139840	And with the cooperation sharing and exchange of information,
3139840	3144760	they could make those toolkits that look like the right tools for the job.
3144760	3148960	Neanderthals don't look like they had an information sharing-based use
3148960	3151280	of the landscape.
3151280	3155400	I call this a culturally constructed landscape.
3155400	3157960	They know where to go and what to do on the landscape because they've
3157960	3161600	got information that they've gotten shared through cultural mechanisms,
3161600	3166280	language, through friendships, their networks.
3166280	3169040	Neanderthals don't look like they had these networks.
3169040	3174280	They probably spoke in the imperative.
3174280	3177240	They didn't have these extended social landscapes.
3177240	3179320	If they left home, they were dinner.
3181600	3186560	So it looks like they developed the original social security system
3186560	3191520	as the best way I can describe it with reciprocal gift exchange.
3191520	3195080	So I'm pinning, based upon the archaeology,
3195080	3200240	where we see the hard evidence for extended social landscapes
3200240	3205200	in stone tools that have traveled further than the distance of the diameter
3205200	3211160	of 100 gatherers territory, even in the driest environments.
3211160	3215760	That's where I pin this troop to tribe transition.
3215760	3220720	So this also helps facilitate the exploitation of very risky habitats.
3220720	3224480	You can go out somewhere knowing you have a safety net to come back to.
3224480	3227600	If resources fail, you can move in with your friends.
3227600	3232320	A lot of this networking is about reciprocal rights of access
3232320	3235800	to each other's territories without getting shot.
3235800	3240840	So this would also allow expansions out of Africa.
3240840	3246040	So the timing out of Africa, 60 to 50,000 years ago, fits with this.
3248680	3249960	They worked out the system.
3249960	3252480	They did all the R&D in Africa.
3252480	3255680	And what we think of is it was upper paleolithic mammoth hunters
3255680	3260280	and painters making beautiful blades and art, fancy tools.
3260280	3265040	Those things go back 30,000 years earlier in Africa.
3265040	3273880	So cooperative tribes could outcompete Neanderthal troops.
3273880	3277960	Now, I'm not sure if I have more time.
3277960	3282680	Christian, I could cut it off here.
3282680	3288520	And because what I'm going to do now would take you
3288520	3292200	in a completely different direction.
3292200	3293760	Is it all right?
3293800	3296800	All right, here we go.
3296800	3300240	The biology of cooperation.
3300240	3306920	I was stunned with the epiphany when I read a paper in Scientific American
3306920	3315000	in July 2008 about oxytocin, the love hormone, the trust hormone.
3315000	3321080	And that there are genes that underlie the susceptibility to the influence
3321080	3323320	of these pro and antisocial hormones.
3323360	3325560	And they vary among individuals.
3325560	3330280	And they're widespread throughout the animal kingdom, vertebrate animals.
3330280	3333440	And even invertebrates.
3333440	3336560	They are things like oxytocin.
3336560	3342280	Some variants of serotonin and vasopressin are more pro-social.
3342280	3345200	Testosterone is an antisocial one.
3345200	3348080	Fill her up with testosterone.
3348080	3350160	We know about that.
3350160	3354160	Each hormone system does have actually pro and antisocial variants.
3354160	3358240	Some people are totally resistant to the effects of oxytocin.
3358240	3365160	Others, I think that the used car salesmen might be spraying it around their offices.
3365160	3367200	Some people are suckers.
3367200	3374360	And you can, in the laboratory, make them more generous, more accepting of less
3374360	3378920	generous offers, more tolerant, and more likely to give.
3378920	3381160	Some don't do it at all.
3381160	3384720	Did Neanderthals have mainly antisocial variants of these hormones?
3384720	3390360	Were they more predominant prior to TOBA?
3390360	3393440	We'll see if we can figure this out.
3393440	3398760	Did frequencies of pro-social genes increase in Africans during the bottleneck?
3398760	3401480	The time when you need the most trust and cooperation?
3401480	3404880	If you were living in a very, very small population, I didn't tell you that
3404880	3410600	geneticists say that the genetic diversity of today could be accounted for by 5,000
3410600	3415440	breeding-aged females 70,000 years ago.
3415440	3424000	You could multiply that by six for parents, non-reproductive males and females, 60,000
3424000	3425000	people.
3425000	3430400	It is enough to account for the genetic diversity of the whole planet, a little bit higher now
3430400	3433720	because they keep measuring more genetic diversity in Africa.
3434280	3435840	Do hormones fossilize?
3435840	3439440	Well, I don't think so.
3439440	3440440	You never know.
3440440	3442040	Biochemistry is getting great.
3442040	3448480	I was hoping to get this by answer out of the genes in the fossil bones themselves, but
3448480	3455680	most fossil bones don't have genes, genetics preserved, genes preserved, but testosterone
3455680	3462400	seems to have some interesting skeletal effects and some of the other hormones do too.
3462400	3469200	We know this clinically that it will increase the jaw length and facial height of young
3469200	3474840	boys if you give them extra testosterone during puberty, if they're having delayed puberty.
3474840	3480080	Orthodontists need to know this.
3480080	3489440	Jessamy Doman and Andrew Hill and colleagues at Yale presented this paper two years ago
3489480	3497040	at the Paleoanthropology Society, a new osteological approach to inferring social behavior, hominin
3497040	3503200	social behavior, facial indicators of testosterone level.
3503200	3512600	Indeed, there's a fossil trace of testosterone and they concluded that early Homo sapiens
3512600	3521120	and Homo neanderthalensis, so that's Homo sapiens earlier than 80,000, had elevated
3521120	3527120	levels of testosterone and maybe more male-male competition.
3527120	3531440	We know a lot about that.
3531440	3537760	High salivary testosterone is linked to masculine male facial appearance.
3537760	3542400	This is an Australian aborigine.
3542400	3547480	That's one of the most complete skeletons that was known in the early 1900s.
3547480	3550360	Marcel Boule put this together.
3550360	3556840	After learning about this face-shaped stuff, I started looking at these skulls in a very
3556840	3561480	different way as maybe the product of sexual selection.
3561480	3564120	Neanderthals have these big jutting faces.
3564120	3565720	This is a pre-Neanderthal.
3565760	3570520	Look at the third molar here, how far it's angled out.
3570520	3574880	It's as if they were trying to get that jaw out as far as they could.
3574880	3577000	It's amazing.
3577000	3578320	There's a big gap there.
3578320	3581400	We can't stick our finger behind our third molar.
3581400	3584640	The jaw ascending ramus is in the way.
3584640	3590680	They could stick a big, sharpie marker pen back there.
3590680	3592200	That's a big gap.
3592200	3594160	Why were those teeth getting pulled out?
3594160	3596600	Why was the jaw pulling out like that?
3596600	3600400	They had huge noses too, big nasal passages.
3600400	3603320	Well, how about voices?
3603320	3607160	This is a different way of looking at things.
3607160	3611440	The larynx can grow completely out of proportion to other body parts under the influence of
3611440	3616280	testosterone at puberty in human males.
3616280	3621160	Hypertrophied larynx of human males and their disproportionately low-pitched voices are
3621160	3631160	an adaptation to exaggerating body size, just like beards.
3631160	3639440	We use voices to assess physical strength and fighting ability, don't we?
3639440	3641800	I brought a heuristic device here.
3641800	3649640	With my grandchildren, I can give them a little scare if I go, I can give them shock and fright
3649640	3662960	if I go, so you musicians know, tenor sax, alto, you name it, the bigger, the vocal tract,
3662960	3668720	the super pharyngeal vocal tract, the deeper your voice.
3668720	3673440	So there's a modern human and luscious pell again.
3673440	3678840	If we keep the hyoid in the same position, that's what holds your voice box, then the
3678840	3683400	distance to wherever the lips might be out here would be quite large.
3683400	3694560	Now, we know this, that people with big lower faces have deep voices, Barry White.
3694560	3699440	And Ron Perlman, his first big role was the Neanderthal Inquest for Fire.
3699440	3702880	He has a really deep voice.
3702880	3705440	I was in, let's see, where was this?
3705440	3706440	This is Beijing.
3706720	3713800	I think, yes, that was in the Beijing Museum, across from Tiananmen Square in, just Christmas,
3713800	3721520	actually, and I just, just struck by the, the fighter, it's a full-size ceramic tricolor
3721520	3727640	statue, three-glazed statue of a fighter, and I thought, well, yeah, he looks like a
3727640	3728640	fighter.
3728640	3729840	Look at that jaw.
3729840	3734320	And if you go into all the Buddhist shrines and temples, you will see that the Buddha
3734320	3739480	is surrounded by guys with these huge lower faces and big brow ridges, even though he
3739480	3743480	has a real baby face.
3743480	3744840	They're protecting him.
3744840	3752240	Now, the last part of hormones, testosterone responses are related to facial masculinity
3752240	3760760	for competition, testosterone administration decreases generosity, okay, but oxytocin
3760760	3763280	increases trust.
3763280	3769360	Now, Professor Rangham, I think he had to leave here, he's part of this research group
3769360	3777480	and Peter Ellison as well, and most of the people on this list are just upstairs here.
3777480	3783720	Among chimpanzees, testosterone levels increase markedly during adolescence.
3783720	3786280	This is a common chimpanzee.
3786280	3795240	The bonobo, which is the, I suppose you could call them the free love hippie chimpanzees,
3795240	3796240	do not change.
3796240	3800360	Now, let's just do a little comparison here.
3800360	3806960	Bonobos, I'm calling them tribes because of the last point on this list.
3806960	3811160	Females are dominant, they have low sexual dimorphism, there's not a lot of difference
3811160	3814640	between males and females.
3814640	3821400	Females are very rare, intergroup counters are amazing, they're peaceful, they party.
3821400	3830120	The males get kind of like, but then they say, I give up, and they come together peacefully
3830120	3836800	and then they go on their separate ways, feeling good.
3836800	3844400	Sea troops, Professor Rangham here is well documented, lots of aspects of their male
3844400	3847080	aggression, he's written a whole book about it.
3847080	3852360	They have high sexual dimorphism, big canines compared to the females.
3852360	3857160	They are highly aggressive and they have these intergroup encounters that are violent and
3857160	3858160	often deadly.
3858160	3864520	A group of males will go off and patrol, they'll sit and listen, see if they can find a lone
3864520	3870520	male and then they'll kill him.
3870520	3876560	The last piece of the puzzle was published last summer, 2014.
3876560	3880760	This is supposed to be an anatomically modern human, sometimes I wasn't sure if they were
3880760	3882760	Neanderthals.
3882760	3888160	Very rugged, they're older than 80,000, at places like Shkuhul and Kafsa Cave in Israel.
3888160	3891480	Here's a post 80,000 year old skeleton.
3891480	3897400	Most of the, all the humans younger than 80,000 are much less robust.
3897400	3903320	Something happened around that time of Toba.
3903320	3913400	The hypothesis I proposed in 2010 that Toba was a strong selective force for killing off
3913400	3919720	anti-social people among the Africans in those harsh environments is quite consistent with
3919720	3920720	this.
3921120	3925200	So that's my hypothesis.
3925200	3927040	So here we are.
3927040	3935600	It's not just charisma, image and sarcasm, against more basic instincts.
3935600	3938440	I think Neanderthals spoke in the imperative.
3938440	3941120	Okay, you can fill in the caption here.
3941120	3945320	Maybe you remember this episode of Star Trek.
3945320	3951600	Kirk and his crew are captives in the Klingon ship.
3951600	3957800	And Kirk looks at him and he says, what do you think he's saying to the Klingon commander
3957800	3960720	that's going to get them out of there?
3960720	3966880	He says something to the effect.
3966880	3972360	And he turns around and he snarls at his command, his second in command.
3972360	3976760	And they start fighting amongst themselves like a big bar fight.
3976760	3982680	And these guys just steal away and go, beam me up, Scotty.
3982680	3986680	Short tempered.
3986680	3996240	Now, catastrophic theories usually put you on the fringe.
3996240	4002320	I don't have a Nobel Prize to promote something that is now widely accepted but has taken
4002320	4007840	40 years and there's still holdouts that the asteroid that hit the Yucatan Peninsula
4007840	4013360	65,000 years ago wasn't responsible for big change.
4013360	4018240	So if that asteroid didn't happen, where would we be now?
4018240	4021840	We'd be scurrying around in the underbrush and up in the tips of trees, watching out
4021840	4025640	for those snapping jaws.
4025640	4033840	So we could make the same question about what happened 73,880 years ago.
4033840	4041040	Would we still be more like primate troops than human tribes?
4041040	4047200	That's a hard question to answer because we have lots of evidence of some artistic creativity
4047200	4049560	before 80,000 years ago.
4049560	4059280	But creativity and art and pro-sociality, that's not a perfect one-to-one correlation,
4059280	4061080	so to speak.
4061080	4064880	Anyways, that's my story and I'm sticking with it.
