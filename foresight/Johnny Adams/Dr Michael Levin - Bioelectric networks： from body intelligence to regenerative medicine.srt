00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
Welcome to our gerontology research group online meeting.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,360
Today is Friday, March 24th, 2023.

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,640
And special thanks to Miles Jacobs,

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,880
who manages our meetings.

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,360
I'm kind of busy solving the problems

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,040
of biological aging these days.

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,960
And without Miles,

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,900
we probably wouldn't have as many of these meetings

9
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,680
and they definitely would not be as high quality

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,520
as the one we're gonna have today.

11
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:35,040
Today we have an extraordinary innovative speaker,

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,920
Dr. Michael Levin.

13
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,360
And Dr. Levin is distinguished professor

14
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,480
and Vannevar Bush chair,

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,920
biology department at Tufts,

16
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,520
and director of the Allen Discovery Center at Tufts.

17
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,520
He's also associate faculty at Harvard's Dease Institute.

18
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:59,520
In his lab, he studies basic questions of information

19
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,520
processing and biology,

20
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,640
and drives applications in regenerative medicine

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,600
and synthetic bioengineering.

22
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,720
It must have been 20 years ago,

23
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,240
I read a book, The Body Electric by Becker,

24
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,160
and I was just amazed at the opportunity.

25
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,760
And now I believe Dr. Levin

26
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,640
is going to bring some of that to life for you.

27
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,880
So I will hand the floor over to Dr. Michael Levin.

28
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,000
Well, thank you so much for the invitation

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,720
and thank you for the opportunity to talk to you all

30
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,920
and share some ideas.

31
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,640
I am not directly working in the field of aging,

32
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,160
but I think we have some thoughts

33
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,440
that are possibly useful for that set of questions.

34
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,240
And so if anybody's interested,

35
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,040
this is the website where you can find all the primary papers,

36
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,320
the software, the data sets, and everything else.

37
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,000
So I'm going to talk about today

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,360
is an approach towards what I call

39
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,200
a definitive regenerative medicine.

40
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,680
I will explain what I mean.

41
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,120
And in my view,

42
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,560
the road to this definitive regenerative medicine

43
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,480
contains large components of understanding

44
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,280
natural bioelectrical signaling between cells,

45
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,600
specifically not just as a physical mechanism,

46
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,440
but actually as the medium

47
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,640
for the collective intelligence of groups of cells.

48
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,520
So what I mean by a definitive regenerative medicine

49
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,040
is breaking the unsustainable feedback loop

50
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,920
or cycle between this scheme

51
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,840
where we try these interventions late in life.

52
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,840
And to whatever extent we can push forward the lifespan,

53
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,880
the next set of interventions

54
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,480
has to be increasingly more heroic

55
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,040
because what you're basically dealing with

56
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,640
is a continuously sinking ship.

57
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,960
And this is unacceptable for us as patients.

58
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,040
It's unsupportable for any society

59
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,600
because it exponentially increases the cost

60
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,320
of each further intervention that has to be done.

61
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,240
So something radical has to break this cycle.

62
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,440
And if we think about it,

63
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,600
all of the problems of medicine

64
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,680
with the exception of infectious disease.

65
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,160
So we're talking about birth defects, traumatic injuries,

66
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,920
cancer, aging, degenerative disease, all of this

67
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,920
have one important thing in common.

68
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,200
They are all problems of information processing

69
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,560
in the following sense.

70
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,040
If we could control what it is that groups of cells build,

71
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,880
that is if we could convince groups of cells

72
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,800
to build particular complex anatomical structures,

73
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,400
all of these problems would go away.

74
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,680
We could continuously rebuild structures of the body

75
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,840
to maintain health span, repair injuries,

76
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,440
reprogram cancer.

77
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,880
All of these things would be resolved

78
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,240
if we understood how to get cells

79
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,960
to build particular anatomical structures.

80
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,960
And so the kind of end game of this whole field,

81
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,960
I call something that can be termed

82
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,920
as the anatomical compiler.

83
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,160
The idea is that someday in the future,

84
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,120
we will be able to sit down in front of a computer

85
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,440
and draw in terms of the anatomy that you want

86
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,080
your plant or animal to have.

87
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,840
So not molecular pathways,

88
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,480
not the underlying biochemical details,

89
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,680
but what you actually care about,

90
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,040
which is the form and function.

91
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,760
So you will draw this some sort of anatomical structure

92
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,560
like this three-headed flatworm.

93
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,440
And if we knew what we were doing,

94
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,960
the anatomical compiler would convert

95
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,320
that anatomical descriptor into a set of stimuli

96
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,760
that would get cells to build exactly that.

97
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,600
So what we're talking about

98
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,600
is complete control over growth and form.

99
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,480
This is the radical solution that we need.

100
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,440
Now note that this kind of thing is not a 3D printer.

101
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,160
The point is not to micromanage

102
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,760
where every single cell goes.

103
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,160
It's a communications device.

104
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,800
And we'll get back to this concept

105
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,760
towards the end of the talk.

106
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,160
So having focused in on this idea

107
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,160
that it is the cooperative action of collectives of cells

108
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,240
that build our various organs,

109
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,120
either healthy organs or not,

110
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,200
we can then ask this very simple question.

111
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,520
Where does the body anatomy come from in the first place?

112
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,560
So this is a cross-section of a human torso.

113
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,600
You see all the amazing structures that are here, right?

114
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,400
Everything is the correct size, shape relative to

115
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,160
the things next to it and the correct orientation.

116
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,600
So where is this structure set?

117
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,880
Where is this order specified?

118
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,160
And lots of people are kind of intuitively will say,

119
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,600
well, it's the genome, it's in the DNA.

120
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,320
But if we look closer at that claim,

121
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,640
we now understand we can sequence genomes.

122
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,680
Now we know what's in the DNA.

123
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,440
The DNA doesn't say anything directly

124
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,360
about large-scale anatomical parameters.

125
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,720
What the DNA specifies is proteins.

126
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,680
It specifies the micro-level hardware

127
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,920
that each individual cell gets to have.

128
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,520
And so what we still need to understand

129
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,040
is how the actual collective activity of these cells

130
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,120
with the hardware that they have from their genome

131
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,760
works together to build the right thing.

132
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,120
That is a species-specific target morphology.

133
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,600
How do these cells know when to stop?

134
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,000
Why do cells sometimes defect from this plan

135
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,320
and form cancer?

136
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,800
We'll talk a little bit about that.

137
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,320
How would we induce, if a part of this is missing or damaged,

138
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,840
how would we induce these cells to rebuild,

139
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,320
damage their aging structures?

140
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,320
And as engineers, how far can we push this process?

141
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,720
What else can these cells build

142
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,720
besides their normal default target morphology?

143
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,480
And so I want to kind of start off by thinking about

144
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,520
what's necessary to understand this process.

145
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,120
And we've had great advances in genomics

146
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,200
and molecular biology and big data and genetics and so on.

147
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,720
And so you might think that,

148
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,240
well, this should be solved already.

149
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,520
Why do we not have this anatomical compiler?

150
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,160
And I just want to be very clear

151
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,640
that very, very fundamental things are still impossible

152
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,920
from the perspective of genetics and molecular biology.

153
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,400
So this is just one example.

154
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,000
So here's a baby axolotl.

155
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,960
It's a little salamander.

156
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,760
Baby axolotls have four legs.

157
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,960
This is a frog larva or a tadpole,

158
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,840
which do not have legs.

159
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,560
And in my lab, what we can do is we can make frog allotls,

160
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,680
which is an embryo that's part salamander cells,

161
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,840
part frog cells.

162
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,760
Now, I pose a simple question.

163
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,200
Will frog allotls have legs or won't they?

164
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,240
Now, we've got the genome for the axolotl.

165
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,080
It's been sequenced.

166
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,280
We've got the genome for the frog.

167
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,840
It's been sequenced.

168
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,720
Can anybody tell me whether frog allotls

169
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,080
are going to have legs or not?

170
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,920
And the answer is no.

171
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,560
We have no idea or even more subtle questions like,

172
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,400
if they do have legs,

173
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,040
are they going to be made entirely of the axolotl cells

174
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,240
or are they in fact going to induce

175
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,000
some of the frog cells to participate?

176
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,480
And that's because this kind of question

177
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,920
is not a question that could be answered

178
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,960
at the level of the hardware.

179
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,200
This is a collective intelligence question.

180
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,800
What are these complex agents going to build?

181
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,800
And we are still not very good at understanding

182
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,880
the rules of that kind of process.

183
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,920
So where we are really is that molecular medicine

184
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,200
is very good at understanding

185
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,800
which genes and proteins interact

186
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,200
with which other genes and proteins.

187
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,680
And so we can build nice models like this.

188
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,680
But we are really quite a long way away

189
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,360
from the control of large scale structure and function.

190
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,120
If you wanted to make rational changes at the system level,

191
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,120
it is very hard to know what to do back here.

192
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,720
And so I think where molecular medicine is today

193
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,480
is roughly where computer science was in the 40s and 50s.

194
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,160
If you wanted to program a computer,

195
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,040
you had to interact with the hardware.

196
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,000
You had to directly rewire it physically.

197
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,960
You were always down at that hardware level.

198
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,520
And this is where we are today.

199
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:44,520
So all of the most exciting parts of molecular medicine,

200
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,240
so genome editing, CRISPR, protein engineering,

201
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,200
pathway rewiring, all of these things

202
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,760
are really down at the biological hardware level.

203
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,320
We haven't even really begun to take advantage

204
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,840
of what computer science has done

205
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,760
to give us the information technology revolution,

206
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,040
which is to figure out that actually,

207
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,520
if your hardware is good enough,

208
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,280
and I'm going to argue that biological hardware

209
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,640
is definitely good enough,

210
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,520
then what you can do is you can communicate with it

211
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,560
via a high level interface.

212
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,080
You don't have to, this is the reason why

213
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,880
when you want to change from PowerPoint

214
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,440
to Zoom on your laptop,

215
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,760
you don't get out your soldering iron and start rewiring.

216
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,960
It's because we have this nice interface

217
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,520
that allows you access to some of the computational capacities

218
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,520
of the system that are reprogrammable.

219
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,200
In other words, could we take advantage

220
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,280
of a higher level of information processing specifically,

221
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,160
and I'm going to define this word in a minute,

222
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,520
specifically the intelligence of the software of life.

223
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,720
And the thing about biology,

224
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,560
which is actually not captured today

225
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,760
in any of our computational devices

226
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,720
or robotics or anything like that,

227
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,400
is this amazing multi-scale competency architecture

228
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,840
where we're not just a nested doll,

229
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,440
set of nested dolls structurally,

230
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,920
where you've got molecular networks and cells

231
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,320
and tissues and organs and swarms and so on.

232
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,120
But actually, each one of these layers has competencies

233
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,120
that solve specific problems in its own space.

234
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,840
So we have a problem solving in physiological space,

235
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,120
in transcriptional space,

236
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,840
meaning the space of gene expression,

237
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,120
in anatomical morphous space,

238
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,440
and of course, in familiar 3D behavioral space

239
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,320
in the case of whole organisms.

240
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,840
And so we could spend hours talking

241
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,520
about all these different examples,

242
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,080
but I just want to highlight a couple of things

243
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,560
and then spend most of my time

244
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,920
talking about the morphogenetic problem solving.

245
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,800
So just to give you an example

246
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,600
of some of the amazing plasticity of life,

247
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,360
this is what we've done here is we've made a tadpole.

248
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,320
So here's the mouth, here are the nostrils,

249
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,920
the brain, the gut, the tail,

250
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,640
in which you'll notice something very strange

251
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,480
about this tadpole.

252
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,680
There aren't any eyes where the eye should be.

253
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,440
What we've done is we've placed some eye cells on its tail.

254
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,720
Now these cells, they have no problem forming a perfect eye,

255
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,080
even though they're sitting next to muscle

256
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,440
instead of next to the brain.

257
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,120
They then put out a single optic nerve, which crawls out.

258
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,800
It synapses on the spinal cord right here, then it stops,

259
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,960
it does not go to the brain,

260
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,400
it sort of ends on the spinal cord.

261
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,880
And these animals, as we found from building a machine

262
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,800
that automates the training and testing

263
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,760
of these guys on visual cues,

264
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,200
these animals can see quite well.

265
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,360
They see perfectly well out of this eye.

266
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,320
And so what you see here is this amazing plasticity

267
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,680
where this brain that expected visual input

268
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,880
from these two locations for millions of years,

269
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,320
this is the architecture.

270
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,480
In one generation, no adaptation,

271
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,520
specific adaptation needed,

272
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,360
the fact that the sensory motor architecture

273
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,000
is now completely different, no problem.

274
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,720
They're able to incorporate that

275
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,600
into their behavioral repertoire.

276
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,600
So it's clear that there are these interesting capabilities

277
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,280
of these kinds of biological systems to adapt to novel.

278
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,480
Circumstances, and this is what we're going to hijack.

279
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,640
These are the kinds of things we're going to hijack

280
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:58,440
for a kind of a really, really radical regenerative medicine.

281
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,520
What I wanna spend some time on now

282
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,080
is to introduce you to this little critter,

283
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,520
which I think in many ways,

284
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,200
this model system has the answer

285
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,320
to many of the big questions of life,

286
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,880
not only medicine, but beyond.

287
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,800
This is a planarian flatworm.

288
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,560
So these are not simple organisms like earthworms.

289
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,840
These are similar to our direct ancestor.

290
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,600
They have true bilateral symmetry.

291
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,400
They have a true centralized brain.

292
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,520
They have lots of organs, lots of different cell types,

293
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,320
all the same neurotransmitters that you and I have.

294
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,480
And they have a number of amazing properties.

295
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,680
The first is regeneration.

296
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,400
So you can cut them into pieces.

297
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,640
The record is something like 275 pieces.

298
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,920
It doesn't matter how you cut them,

299
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,920
what the plane of section is,

300
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,360
you can cut them any way you want.

301
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,360
Each piece regenerates a perfect worm.

302
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,760
It grows exactly what's needed,

303
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,640
no more or less gives you a perfect, perfect worm.

304
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,080
They're very cancer resistant.

305
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,320
It's not that they can't get cancer,

306
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,040
but they're extremely resistant and they're immortal.

307
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,280
This is maybe the part

308
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,320
that's the most interesting to all of you.

309
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,760
There is no such thing as an old planarian.

310
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,120
The individual cells senesce and drop off,

311
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,360
but they get regenerated.

312
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,360
This animal regenerates continuously.

313
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,640
And so the animals that are in my lab now

314
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,440
are in direct physical continuity to worms

315
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,160
that were here half a billion years ago.

316
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,960
These are literally them.

317
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,120
They just sort of continue.

318
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,680
And they're smart.

319
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,520
You can train them.

320
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,040
I'll talk about that momentarily.

321
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,840
And they've got this interesting property.

322
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,400
So they've got an incredibly messy genome.

323
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,240
Why?

324
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,440
Because most of us reproduce sexually,

325
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,240
which means that when you reproduce,

326
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,920
your children do not inherit the somatic mutations

327
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,400
that happened in your body during your lifetime.

328
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,680
But in planaria, the way they typically reproduce

329
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,280
is they tear themselves in half and then regenerate.

330
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,160
So any mutation that doesn't kill the stem cell

331
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,000
in which it occurs basically gets propagated

332
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,120
through the body in the subsequent generation.

333
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,480
They hold on to, this is called somatic inheritance.

334
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,240
They've hold on to all of these mutations.

335
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,400
They don't clean them up the way that the rest of us do.

336
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,040
And so their genome is a complete mess.

337
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,960
They can be mix-a-ploid, meaning every cell

338
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,760
has a different number of chromosomes.

339
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,720
They look, it actually looks a lot like what we would say

340
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,880
of a tumor genome.

341
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,920
And yet it has all of these properties.

342
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,400
Now, this is really strange.

343
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,920
In no course of cell developmental biology,

344
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,200
genetics and so on, does anybody give you a theory

345
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,960
that would predict why the animal with the messiest genome

346
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,840
would actually be the most regenerative,

347
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,160
cancer-resistant and immortal?

348
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:37,160
Because what we're told instead is that the genome

349
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,880
and your genotype is actually a critical determinant

350
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,080
of all your capacities.

351
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,400
This goes exactly backwards.

352
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,240
Why would the animal with the worst genome

353
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,240
have all these amazing properties?

354
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,240
Now, they have one more interesting property

355
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,920
which is interesting for aging, which is this.

356
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,200
They're smart, you can train them.

357
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,000
And so if you make little bumps like this

358
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,360
on the laser edge, little bumps on the surface

359
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,680
and you feed them with liver on this region.

360
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,000
And so they remember that this is sort of a safe place

361
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,200
where they can eat.

362
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,080
Then you can cut off their heads

363
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,320
and the tail will sit there for a week and a half

364
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,480
doing nothing.

365
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,200
They will then regenerate eventually a brain,

366
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,440
the head with the entire brain.

367
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,080
And then you will find out that these animals

368
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,120
still remember the original training.

369
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,520
So what you see in this model system,

370
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,560
you can actually look at the distribution of memory

371
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,920
in the rest of the body, meaning outside the brain.

372
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,680
And most importantly, the imprinting of that information

373
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,160
onto a new brain as it develops.

374
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,360
Besides kind of a fundamental philosophical implications,

375
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,080
what the medical kind of impact of this

376
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,400
is that in the future, when we have regenerative therapies

377
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,360
that replace cells in a human patient's brain,

378
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,760
which may have six or seven decades of memories

379
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,560
and personality and so on with progeny of naive new cells,

380
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,440
the question is what happens to the personality

381
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,280
of that patient?

382
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,520
And these kind of models start to suggest

383
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,600
that actually there may be considerable hope

384
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,880
that these properties are actually spread farther

385
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,120
than one thinks and may actually be imprinted

386
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,520
onto the new tissue.

387
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,880
So let's think about how all this amazing plasticity works,

388
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,440
regeneration of body and of memories.

389
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,560
How does it work?

390
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,080
Well, the key is this, that all of us

391
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,560
used to be individual cells.

392
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,600
We all started life as an unfertilized oocyte,

393
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,040
a quiescent oocyte that's a little pile of biochemistry.

394
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,880
And through this process of development,

395
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,760
you become one of these creatures

396
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,280
or perhaps one like this.

397
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,640
This is Renee Descartes,

398
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,680
who is going to have all kinds of opinions

399
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,640
about the living beings and machines and so on.

400
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,480
But notice that this process is completely continuous.

401
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,640
There is no magical flash during development

402
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,280
where you say this is the moment

403
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,960
where you went from being chemistry and physics

404
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,440
as a quiescent oocyte to a being

405
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,680
with metacognitive capacities and so on.

406
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,400
This is a slow and gradual developmental process.

407
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,200
And this is the sort of thing

408
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,040
that we're made of.

409
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,400
Now, this is a free living organism

410
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,160
known as a lacrimaria.

411
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,760
There's no brain, there's no nervous system, it's one cell.

412
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,360
And all of its problems are solved within a single cell.

413
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,720
So it's metabolic needs, it's physiological needs,

414
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,480
it's behavioral, morphological repertoire.

415
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,560
All of this is taken care of in one cell.

416
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:27,640
So while these individual cells solve little tiny

417
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,120
kind of goal states at the level of a single cell,

418
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,160
together they work towards very large scale

419
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,040
construction projects like this.

420
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,480
And that process, what we're going to do

421
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,320
is look at the involvement in that process

422
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,840
of something that I refer to as intelligence.

423
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,520
What do I mean by intelligence?

424
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,040
I mean what William James meant,

425
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,240
which is the ability to reach the same goal

426
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,120
by different means, that's it.

427
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,760
When I say intelligence, I do not mean

428
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,280
it has to do anything with brains.

429
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,160
I don't mean it has to be this kind of metacognitive,

430
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,480
I know how smart I am or I know what I know.

431
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,720
It just means the ability to deploy some level of competency

432
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,440
to reach the same goal state by different means

433
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,400
depending on what's happening in the environment.

434
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,440
So some level of ingenuity and problem solving.

435
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,440
So let's see some examples.

436
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,880
One thing we know about development is that it's very reliable.

437
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,800
So you start off as a single cell, the egg,

438
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,440
and then reliably this collection of cells

439
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,880
navigates that space of possible shapes

440
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,360
to reach that species specific morphology,

441
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,920
a normal organism.

442
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,880
But actually it's reliable, but it isn't hardwired.

443
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,640
Because if you come along halfway through

444
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,360
and split the embryo in half or in quarters,

445
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,680
you don't get two half bodies, as you would

446
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,120
with a typical device that we've made until now.

447
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,800
What instead you'll get is two perfectly normal

448
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,280
monosygotic twins.

449
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,760
In fact, this is a system that can reach this.

450
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,840
So here's the kind of abstract anatomical morpho space.

451
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,520
Here's the ensemble of states we recognize

452
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,880
as a normal human anatomy.

453
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,800
And you can actually get there

454
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,000
from multiple different starting positions,

455
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
even avoiding some local maxima,

456
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,480
because this is not a hardwired system.

457
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,520
Not only is regulative development like that,

458
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,800
but in some animals, they do that as adults.

459
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,920
So here's the saxolotl, the salamander

460
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,120
that can regenerate its limbs, its eyes, its jaws,

461
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,040
its spinal cord and tail,

462
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,920
ovaries, portions of the brain and heart.

463
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,680
And what it looks like is this,

464
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,880
if you amputate a leg anywhere along this distance,

465
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,200
what the cells will do is rapidly grow

466
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,280
and undergo morphogenesis to restore exactly what's needed,

467
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,600
and then they stop.

468
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,440
And it can do that from this position,

469
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,680
from any position, it makes only what's needed.

470
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,840
This is the most amazing part of regeneration,

471
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,280
is that it stops.

472
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,480
How does it know when to stop?

473
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,720
Well, it stops when a correct salamander arm

474
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,680
has been completed, that's when it stops.

475
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,960
So we need to start to understand,

476
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,480
how does it know where it's going

477
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,920
in this anatomical morpho space?

478
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,360
How, what are the policies guiding the navigation

479
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,640
in the space of these cells?

480
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,520
And how do they know when they've gotten there?

481
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:08,000
By the way, this isn't just for frogs and flatworms

482
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,960
and salamanders, humans have some of this

483
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,840
and mammals, some mammals have more.

484
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,000
Of course, the human liver is highly regenerative.

485
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,120
Deer, a large adult mammal,

486
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,760
regenerates up to a centimeter and a half of newborn per day

487
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,840
when they're regrowing their antlers.

488
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,920
And human children can regenerate their fingertips

489
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,280
below a certain age.

490
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,480
If you just keep the wound clean,

491
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,000
they will actually regrow a cosmetically normal fingertip.

492
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,880
So we have this critical question.

493
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,800
How does the collective decision-making of these cell

494
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,920
groups determine what they're supposed to be building,

495
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,200
when they're supposed to stop,

496
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,120
and actually, what are the failure modes?

497
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,760
Why doesn't it work in humans all the time?

498
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,000
Why are we not like axolotls or salamanders?

499
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,720
So we started to study this process

500
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,760
and in particular, starting to look at these questions

501
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,680
of how do collections of cells represent the goal states

502
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,800
that guide their construction projects?

503
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,080
And so we took our inspiration from the nervous system

504
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,360
because if you're trying to think of an example

505
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:11,720
of a collection of cells that can store large-scale

506
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,320
navigational set points in some kind of space

507
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,960
and then act to implement them and then stop when they're done,

508
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,760
of course, the nervous system is the best example

509
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,880
we have of that.

510
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,800
And so what allows it to do that is this,

511
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,800
the hardware looks like this.

512
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,960
You've got cells we call neurons.

513
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,360
They have these little ion channel proteins

514
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,880
in their cell membranes, which move ions around

515
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,680
and generate a voltage potential.

516
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:40,080
This may or may not be propagated to their neighbors

517
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,520
via electrical synapses known as gap junctions.

518
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,360
So that's that kind of excitable medium is the hardware.

519
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,720
And what it does is it underlies the software,

520
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,040
which is the physiology of electrical states

521
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,400
moving through the system.

522
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,680
This is a video which this group made

523
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:59,440
of the real-time electrical activity

524
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,800
in the zebrafish brain.

525
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,760
And it is the commitment of neuroscience

526
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:06,200
that all of the animal's cognitive capacity,

527
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,400
so all of the computation, all of the memories,

528
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,680
the goals, the preferences, the behavioral repertoires,

529
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:15,040
all of it is encoded in this electrical activity.

530
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,040
And so there's this process of neural decoding,

531
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,360
this idea that if we knew how,

532
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,520
we would be scanning these electrical states

533
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:26,680
and decoding them to really understand

534
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,760
what the animal is thinking, what it's seeing, and so on.

535
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,600
Actually, there's been some progress in this,

536
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,760
both in human patients and in mice and so on.

537
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,200
There's been some progress in this neural decoding.

538
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,800
But the really interesting aspect of this

539
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,320
is that this is not unique to the brain.

540
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,600
Every cell in your body has ion channels.

541
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,560
Most cells have these gap junctions to their neighbors.

542
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,320
And you can imagine a very parallel,

543
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,200
and this is what we've been doing for 25 years now,

544
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,000
you can imagine a very parallel process

545
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,280
where you take all of the tools and concepts of neuroscience

546
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,640
and you simply port them outside of the nervous system

547
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,600
and ask, okay, what are the computations

548
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,960
that the rest of the body cells are doing?

549
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,040
And might they underlie a kind of decision-making,

550
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,360
in particular the one we care about,

551
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,720
which is morphogenetic solution to morphogenetic problems,

552
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,440
injury, aging, cancer, and so on.

553
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,800
So what we have here is a really clean isomorphism

554
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,280
where what the nervous system does

555
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,600
is use the electrophysiological software

556
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:31,480
to make decisions and those decisions result

557
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,440
in signals being given to your muscles,

558
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,120
which move you through three-dimensional space.

559
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,480
But this amazing system didn't evolve out of nowhere.

560
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,280
What actually happened was that it specialized

561
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:45,200
a far more ancient evolutionary basal bioelectric system,

562
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,200
which works in a very similar way.

563
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,960
It was here long before nerves and muscles evolved.

564
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,400
What it does is exactly the same thing,

565
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,080
networks of electrically active cells

566
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,880
produce bioelectrical signals

567
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,080
that control all of your body cells,

568
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,960
but they don't move you through three-dimensional space,

569
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,400
they move your body configuration

570
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,400
through anatomical morpho space.

571
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,240
This is the system that evolution pivoted

572
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,960
into the control of behavior

573
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,840
when it was speed optimized for nerve and muscle.

574
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,800
And so you can read more about it here,

575
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,240
but the point is that this is as ancient

576
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,560
as bacterial biofilms.

577
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,160
Already evolution had figured out

578
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:25,440
that processing information, storing memories,

579
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,440
collating inputs from other sort of spatially distant areas

580
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,840
was really well accomplished by bioelectrical networks.

581
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,960
So what we did was we developed some of the first tools

582
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,640
to read and write these electrical pattern memories

583
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,640
in morphogenetic contexts.

584
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,800
So the first is a set of voltage dye techniques,

585
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,280
which, so what you're seeing here

586
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,320
is this is a voltage sensitive fluorescent dye.

587
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,760
This is an early frog embryo.

588
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,200
You're looking at all the conversations

589
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,560
that these cells are having with each other

590
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,960
about who's going to be left, right, dorsal, ventral,

591
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,800
and so on.

592
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,200
And this is a video taken by Danny Adams in our group

593
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,640
that basically allows you to see,

594
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,320
much like people do with scanning activity in the brain,

595
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,160
allows you to see all the electrical conversations.

596
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,320
Now, we can also do a lot of modeling

597
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,320
and look at the various channels and pumps that are there

598
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:19,080
and ask, how does, where do these gradients come from?

599
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,120
I wanna show you a couple of examples.

600
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,720
This is a time lapse also made by Danny

601
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,400
of the first stages of a frog embryo

602
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,680
putting its face together.

603
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,240
So what you see here, and this is gray scale

604
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,840
instead of colorized, but same idea,

605
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,520
the brightness value indicates voltage.

606
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,320
And this is one frame taken from that video.

607
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,280
So what you can see here is that long before

608
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,040
these organs are actually formed,

609
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,720
the tissue here already has a plan

610
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,240
of where everything is gonna go.

611
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,440
Here's the eye, here's the mouth, here are the placodes,

612
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,400
and this eye is gonna come in shortly thereafter.

613
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,800
What happens is that this is a native

614
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,960
essential component of normal development.

615
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,080
And not only can you monitor this for incipient defects,

616
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,680
but we actually know that this is functional.

617
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,760
This is instructive.

618
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,920
If we move this bioelectrical pattern,

619
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,360
the gene expression changes and the anatomy follows.

620
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,120
I will show you that momentarily.

621
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,560
So this is a normal part of development,

622
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,640
a normal pre-pattern.

623
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,280
This is a pathological pre-pattern

624
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,760
where if we inject a human oncogene,

625
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,240
there will eventually be a tumor.

626
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,280
But even before that tumor becomes histologically apparent,

627
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,480
you can already see using voltage dye

628
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,960
that these cells have basically disconnected

629
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,880
from their neighbors.

630
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,760
And at this point, all they're going to do

631
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,840
is roll back to their ancient amoeba-like lifestyle.

632
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,040
As far as they're concerned,

633
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,440
the rest of the body is just external environment.

634
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,400
So we'll talk about the cancer soon.

635
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,000
So we developed some techniques

636
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,360
to actually start to read these patterns.

637
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,200
And then we developed even the more important component,

638
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,480
which is the functional technology to change them,

639
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,080
to write, not only to read these data states,

640
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,480
but to actually rewrite them.

641
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,120
And we basically took everything from neuroscience.

642
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,360
So there are no waves, no frequencies,

643
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,840
no electromagnetic radiation, no magnets,

644
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,960
and then nothing like that.

645
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,840
What we do is manipulate the native electrical interface

646
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,560
that these cells are using to control each other's behavior,

647
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,120
which are the ion channels and the gap junctions.

648
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:24,120
So we can genetically, pharmacologically or optically

649
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,200
control the various ion channels

650
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,280
and that changes the voltage states directly,

651
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,200
or we can control the gap junctions,

652
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,000
which determines who talks to whom.

653
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,760
So the topology of the network.

654
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,880
And that corresponds to synaptic plasticity

655
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,640
and intrinsic plasticity if this was a neural tissue.

656
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,440
So now I want to show you some examples

657
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,960
of what happens when you do this, right?

658
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,000
Why do I think that these electrical states

659
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,320
actually mean an eating for morphogenesis?

660
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,720
And so I'll show you a couple of examples.

661
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,120
This is one of them.

662
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,160
So here's an embryo.

663
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:56,520
I showed you that in that electric face image,

664
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,440
you saw that there was a particular bioelectric pattern

665
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,040
that said put an eye here.

666
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,760
So we simply said, okay, if we recapitulate

667
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,800
that pattern somewhere else,

668
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,200
could we convince other cells to make an eye?

669
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,120
And so in this case, in this example,

670
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,640
we've taken some ion channel RNA

671
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,760
encoding some potassium channels,

672
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,080
which we knew would induce that state.

673
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,560
We inject them into precursors of cells

674
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,600
that are going to make gut.

675
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,840
So this is endoderm.

676
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,160
And sure enough, they will go ahead

677
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,760
and make a very nice eye.

678
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,080
Now this, by the way, is a counter

679
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,560
to what you will see in the developmental biology textbook,

680
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,280
which says that only the anterior norectoderm up here

681
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,640
is competent to make eye.

682
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,480
This isn't true.

683
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,720
Well, it's true if you stick with the master I gene

684
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,560
called PAC-6, but it isn't true if you go upstream

685
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,760
to the bioelectric pattern

686
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,720
and you can make eyes anywhere on the tail, on the gut.

687
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,280
Anyway, notice a couple of interesting things about this.

688
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,640
First of all, that it tells you

689
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,680
that these bioelectric patterns are instructive.

690
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:55,560
We're not just screwing up some existing process.

691
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,160
We're actually telling these cells to build an organ,

692
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,840
which has all the right lens and retina and optic nerve

693
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,480
and all the right things.

694
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,320
Second is note the modularity.

695
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,000
What we did not do was put in enough information

696
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
to specify how to build an eye.

697
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,520
You don't have any idea of how to build an eye.

698
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,200
There are lots of different cell types

699
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,600
that are required in a very precise arrangement

700
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,440
to make a proper eye.

701
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,400
We didn't do any of that.

702
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,920
What we did was provide a high level trigger.

703
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,760
If you're a coder,

704
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,760
this is basically a subroutine call

705
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,360
that tells these cells you need to make an eye.

706
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,200
That's it.

707
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,040
Everything else is, all the complexities

708
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,000
pushed onto the system itself,

709
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,240
which is a very nice property for regenerative medicines.

710
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,560
So it's highly modular.

711
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,280
The bioelectric code is not a code for single cells.

712
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,800
It's a code for organs and up.

713
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:44,800
The other kind of capacity which is really interesting

714
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,600
and this harkens back to this idea

715
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,280
of the cells as a collective intelligence is this.

716
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,200
This is a cross section of a lens sitting out

717
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,800
in the tail of a tadpole somewhere that we've induced.

718
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,800
The blue cells, the labeled cells here

719
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,320
are the ones that have the ectopic ion channel.

720
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,600
But notice what's happening.

721
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,800
There's not enough of them to make a proper lens.

722
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,080
So what they've done is recruit

723
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,680
a bunch of their normal neighbors.

724
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,520
They've hijacked some of these other cells

725
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,240
to participate with them in this construction project.

726
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,600
This is something that often happens

727
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,760
in other collective intelligences like ants and termites

728
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,400
where a few of them will actually recruit

729
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:21,200
as many neighbors as needed to complete some larger task.

730
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,160
All of that is intrinsic to the tissue.

731
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,520
We did not have to do any of that.

732
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,960
All we said was build an eye.

733
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,280
All of the parts where the cells have to detect

734
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,760
is there enough of us to build the eye?

735
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,280
If not, how do we signal to the other cells to get them?

736
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,120
What should be the size of the eye, the structure of the eye?

737
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,520
All of this is handled by the tissue itself.

738
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,880
What we are doing is taking advantage

739
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,720
of these competencies, including recruitment.

740
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,240
So we can, using these same techniques,

741
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,480
we can make extra forebrains, as you can see here.

742
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,640
We can make extra legs.

743
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,280
Here are some six-legged frogs.

744
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:57,840
We can make extra hearts, extra odysses or inner ear.

745
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,880
Lots of different organs that we don't know how to make yet.

746
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,080
Also, we can make fins.

747
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,000
This is kind of interesting.

748
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,480
Tatboles aren't supposed to have fins.

749
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,480
That's more of a fish thing.

750
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,880
We'll get to that momentarily.

751
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:12,480
And so having seen that these bioelectric pattern memories

752
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,440
can actually call up different organs,

753
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,720
we began a project in regenerative medicine of the limb.

754
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,920
And so what happens here in the frog?

755
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,000
Frogs, unlike salamanders, do not regenerate their legs

756
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,840
at this stage.

757
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,000
And so you cut off the leg, and 45 days later,

758
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,440
there's basically nothing.

759
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,080
By the way, within 30 seconds of amputating,

760
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,200
so here's this bioelectrical signal at the wound,

761
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,280
within 30 seconds of this amputation,

762
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,760
you see the opposite untouched leg

763
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,440
has lit up exactly the same way.

764
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,680
So there's some kind of long range, and it's not neural.

765
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,640
You can take out all the spinal cord and all the neurons.

766
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,800
It still works.

767
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,360
There's this long range connection

768
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,560
that kind of carries information

769
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,160
about the anatomical order.

770
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:58,720
But what we did is we designed a drug cocktail

771
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:04,160
having to do with the ion levels and thus the voltages

772
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,560
of the cells in the wound to give it

773
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:09,080
a particular bioelectrical state that says rebuild the leg.

774
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,560
And when we do this, here's what happens.

775
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,560
Within a couple of days, this MSX1 major blastema marker

776
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,240
is expressed.

777
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,360
Here it is.

778
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,560
The leg starts to grow by 45 days later.

779
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,640
You've already got some toes.

780
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,400
You've got a toenail.

781
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,480
Eventually, you get a very respectable leg,

782
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,320
and it's touch sensitive and motile

783
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,160
so the animal can feel it.

784
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:32,200
The treatment itself is 24 hours with this drug cocktail.

785
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,400
The leg growth in an adult frog takes a year and a half.

786
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,040
You get a year and a half of leg growth

787
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,720
from a 24 hour intervention.

788
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,160
We do not touch them in between.

789
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,240
So the idea is not to micromanage this process.

790
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,920
It's not to tell the stem cells what to do.

791
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,240
It's not to control the morphogenesis.

792
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:53,720
It's to very early on to shift the navigation policy

793
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,640
of this collection of cells towards building a leg

794
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,480
and away from scarring and blockage.

795
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,000
And that's it.

796
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,440
It's an early stimulus, and then you leave the system alone

797
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,880
and let it do what it needs to do.

798
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,800
So at this point, I have to do a disclosure

799
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:10,280
because Dave Kaplan and I are scientific co-founders

800
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,680
of a company called Morphosuticals Inc.

801
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,240
And the goal is to take these insights

802
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,280
and now to do this in mammals.

803
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,120
And so the idea is we're currently in mice now,

804
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,520
hopefully someday in human patients,

805
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,840
but obviously we're not there yet.

806
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,080
This is kind of just the beginning.

807
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,320
So at this point, what I'd like to do

808
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,480
is to go back to the planaria and kind of to talk about,

809
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,840
again, the role of bioelectricity

810
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,880
and this idea of pattern memories

811
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,240
and how does it help us to understand

812
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,000
how a body keeps itself together?

813
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,840
Because this is really, in terms of a definitive solution

814
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,360
to aging, this is really it.

815
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,680
We really need to understand how cells come and go

816
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,880
all throughout the lifespan.

817
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:54,280
How does a particular large-scale anatomy hold together,

818
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,200
even though cells are coming and going?

819
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,560
And what does it take to reinforce that

820
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,320
so that we have a better health span

821
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:05,160
and that we can retard or abolish this as planaria

822
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,360
have this whole aging process?

823
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,200
So I just want to show you what we've done in planaria.

824
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:13,760
So here is a typical one-headed flatworm.

825
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,040
So you cut off the head and the tail.

826
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,160
You've got this middle fragment.

827
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:20,160
This is a genetic marker that shows us

828
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,680
where the anterior cells are.

829
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,720
So these are the cells that think they're

830
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:27,040
in the front of the worm and so they are.

831
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,880
And so if you do this,

832
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,960
if you cut off the head and the tail,

833
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,640
this middle fragment gives you a nice one-headed worm.

834
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,880
And so we asked a simple question.

835
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,360
How does this middle fragment know

836
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,440
how many heads it's supposed to have?

837
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,000
How many heads should it regrow and at which end?

838
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,880
And so it turns out we've discovered this pathway

839
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,880
involving potassium and proton fluxes.

840
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:50,720
It's an electric circuit that holds the information

841
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,960
of how many heads you're supposed to have.

842
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,600
And so what you can do is you can visualize it.

843
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,440
Here it is.

844
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,600
This fragment here has a pattern.

845
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,440
This is one head, one tail.

846
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,400
And so what we decided to do was to rewrite it.

847
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,760
And we rewrote it and we said, no, actually two heads.

848
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,640
And this is a little messy.

849
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,960
The technology's still being worked out.

850
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,000
But we said, well, a correct planarian

851
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,440
should have two heads like this.

852
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,360
And then what happens is if you take that animal,

853
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,600
and by the way, the gene expression is still normal.

854
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,900
The anterior genes are still in the front, not in the back.

855
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,560
But if you recut this animal,

856
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,400
what it does is it builds a two-headed flatworm.

857
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,840
This is not Photoshop, these are real.

858
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,080
The reason is because this is the actual pattern

859
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,680
that the cells are using to know what to build

860
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,520
and when to stop.

861
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,760
So I promised you at the beginning

862
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,200
that we were going to look at bioelectricity

863
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,560
as the medium of the collection of intelligence

864
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,400
of these cells.

865
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,920
That's literally what this is.

866
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,000
Very much like people are trying to read memories

867
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,700
of future goal states out of living brains,

868
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:53,480
we can now read bioelectrical target states out of tissue

869
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,760
to know what it's going to build and rewrite it.

870
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,720
So this is all the cells have to go on.

871
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,560
If the pattern now says two heads,

872
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,600
that's what they're going to build.

873
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,000
There's nothing they have to compare it with.

874
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,400
We've rewritten the target of this homeostatic process.

875
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,280
So really crucial, this electrical map

876
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,280
is not a map of this two-headed animal.

877
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,280
This is a map of this perfectly normal-looking

878
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,400
one-headed animal and before it gets cut.

879
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,080
So basically a single flatworm

880
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,440
can have two different representations

881
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,640
of what a correct body shape is.

882
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,960
And this shows you these large-scale features

883
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,760
of the body shape are literally encoded

884
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,800
in the electrical states of the circuit.

885
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,320
It's actually a kind of counterfactual memory

886
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,960
because it isn't true right now.

887
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,600
This animal does not have two heads right now.

888
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:40,240
This is a future, it represents what you're going to do

889
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,300
in the future if you get injured.

890
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,120
Now, I keep calling it a memory, why?

891
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,020
Because if we take these two-headed animals

892
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,560
and we amputate the primary head,

893
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,040
we get rid of this ectopic secondary head

894
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,760
and we just let it regenerate in plain water.

895
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,360
It will continue to give rise to two-headed animals forever.

896
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,000
We now know how to set it back.

897
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,840
And here you can see a video of what these guys look like.

898
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,120
So this has all the properties of memory.

899
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:08,080
It's long-term stable, it's rewritable.

900
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,160
It has conditional recall as I just showed you

901
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,600
and it has some possible discrete behaviors.

902
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,240
So this is quite subtle.

903
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,560
You can ask what determines the number of heads

904
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,520
in the planarian?

905
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,480
Well, on the one hand, what the genome does

906
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,320
is create a machine that has by default

907
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,920
an electrical circuit that naturally by default

908
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,320
will start off saying one head.

909
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,720
But that's not the only thing it can say.

910
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,840
It's reprogrammable.

911
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,860
And in fact, if you change it to say two heads, it will keep.

912
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:39,120
So the actual number of heads in the planarian

913
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,480
isn't genetically determined at all.

914
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,480
It's genetically determined is the hardware

915
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,800
and a kind of default state that's there

916
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,160
if nothing else happens.

917
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,280
But it's not just about head number.

918
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,040
It's also about head shape or morphology.

919
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,640
So what you can do is you can take this triangular headed

920
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,840
planarian, amputate the head, let the rest of the body

921
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,880
regenerate while you block some of this electrical

922
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,640
communication, it gets confused.

923
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,440
And sometimes it makes the right head,

924
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,200
but sometimes it makes round heads

925
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,640
like this S-meneterania or flat heads like this Pifelina.

926
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,960
These other species are about 100 to 150 million years distant.

927
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,040
There's nothing genetically wrong with any of these animals.

928
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,840
We've done no genomic editing, no synthetic circuits.

929
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,120
Not only the head shape, but the shape of the brain

930
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:26,160
is just like these other species.

931
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,440
And so what you're doing here is you're exploring other regions

932
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,280
of the morpho space for this genome.

933
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,640
Normally it goes here where it belongs,

934
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,520
but actually it can land in some other attractors that

935
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,560
are typically occupied by other genomes.

936
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,240
But you can visit that in software basically

937
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,480
by just changing the bioelectrical signaling

938
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,200
without actually having to change the genomic hardware.

939
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,600
And you can go further than this.

940
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,520
You can explore the latent morpho space

941
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,840
outwards and look at shapes that don't look like planaria at all.

942
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,200
So you can make these three dimensional cylindrical forms.

943
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,760
You can make these weird spiky shapes.

944
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,800
You can make hybrid forms.

945
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,120
And this ability of cells to build other things

946
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:11,200
than what they normally build is everywhere.

947
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,920
What evolution gives us when it produces cells and bodies

948
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:18,600
are a set of really, really highly hackable, highly

949
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:22,040
programmable machines for solving morphogenetic problems.

950
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,960
And not only bioengineers like us

951
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,120
learn to tap into these controls, but animals do it too.

952
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:30,200
So for example, in the plant world, this is an oak leaf.

953
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,960
And what's happened here is that you would look at an oak leaf

954
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,280
and you would think that these plant cells have only one

955
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,120
kind of capability, which is to grow this nice flat green thing.

956
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,680
But in fact, what happens is when

957
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,400
you act by an insect embryo, a wasp,

958
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,560
it gets the plant cells to build these kind

959
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:50,440
of remarkable three dimensional red structures out

960
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,160
of the plant cells.

961
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,080
These are not wasp cells.

962
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,160
These are plant cells.

963
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,600
And so the plant is basically doing what we do rationally.

964
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:59,920
The wasp does it evolutionarily by providing signals

965
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,160
that trigger these cells to build something completely

966
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:02,720
different.

967
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,760
So this plasticity, this ability to get cells

968
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,840
to build various things or to reinforce the standard morphology

969
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:13,400
is really what we're after in the control of growth and form

970
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,440
for the solution to these kind of biomedical problems.

971
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,480
So what we're doing now is building

972
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,200
a full stack computational system

973
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,520
where you can go from the genetics that tell you

974
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,640
which channels and pumps are in the cells

975
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,440
to the bioelectric simulations that

976
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,800
explain why the gradients are in a certain location,

977
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,520
what the behavior of these gradients

978
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:38,360
are, how they function as a passage of time.

979
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,800
And ultimately, what this means for algorithms,

980
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,880
for human understandable algorithms

981
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:49,040
to derive anatomical structure from these cell behaviors.

982
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,200
And so the last story that I want to tell you for a few minutes

983
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:56,600
is really how we use these computational platforms

984
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,560
to repair damage.

985
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,680
And so perhaps the best worked out system in the example

986
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,200
in this is that of the frog brain.

987
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,240
So here's a normal tadpole brain.

988
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,880
Here's the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain.

989
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:13,840
And there are a wide variety of teratogens, some of them

990
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,200
chemical like nicotine, alcohol, and so on.

991
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,400
And some of them genetic, which I'll show you in a minute,

992
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,080
that mess up brain formation.

993
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,720
So this animal has profound effects.

994
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,640
You can see the brain is completely abnormal.

995
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,080
The eyes are actually connected here.

996
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:28,120
It's missing the forebrain and so on.

997
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:31,640
So we asked the question, how could we repair this?

998
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:34,480
How could we induce repair of such a complex organ?

999
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,880
If we're going to repair, don't we

1000
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,200
need to really understand every part of this

1001
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,000
and really control every bit of this complicated shape

1002
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:41,880
and function?

1003
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,760
So what we did was we built a model,

1004
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,120
and this was by our collaborator, Alexis

1005
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:51,120
Pytaq, who created a computational model of the bioelectrical

1006
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:55,160
pattern that we observed that normally tells this brain what

1007
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,960
size and shape to be.

1008
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,400
And we analyzed this computational model

1009
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,760
to understand all the various ways that it could go wrong.

1010
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,320
And in particular, we asked the model

1011
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:08,240
to work backwards and to suggest an ion channel,

1012
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,640
that we can, or one or more ion channels,

1013
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,160
that we could open or close to get the pattern

1014
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:16,000
to the correct state from an incorrect state.

1015
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,720
So what you have here is you have a computer model

1016
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,680
of the bioelectrics going on inside of a sheet of the nascent

1017
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,960
brain cells, and the pattern isn't correct.

1018
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,120
And so you asked the model, if I wanted to get this bioelectric

1019
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,080
pattern back to where it should be,

1020
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,080
what would I need to do?

1021
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,280
What channels would I open and close?

1022
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:35,120
And this particular model said something very interesting.

1023
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,640
It pointed us to this thing called the HCN2 ion channel.

1024
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,560
The HCN2 ion channel has a very particular interesting

1025
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,160
property, long story short.

1026
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:46,160
It acts kind of like a sharpen filter in Photoshop.

1027
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,160
What it does is it sharpens voltage gradients

1028
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:52,400
between regions of cells with different voltages.

1029
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,960
And here's what that looks like.

1030
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,880
I'm showing you the toughest example we have,

1031
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,520
which is instead of a drug like nicotine or alcohol

1032
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:05,160
or something like that, we used a genetic mutation

1033
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,280
of the notch pathway.

1034
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,520
Notch is a really critical neurogenesis gene.

1035
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,600
It's very important for formation of the brain.

1036
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,680
This is a normal brain.

1037
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,760
This is a brain of an animal with a notch mutation.

1038
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,560
You can see the forebrain is gone.

1039
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,360
The midbrain and hindbrain are a big bubble.

1040
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,400
They have no behavior.

1041
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,000
They just lay there doing nothing.

1042
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,360
So what we did was exactly what the model said,

1043
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:28,400
which is that we treated it with one of two drugs that

1044
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,240
opened up these HCN2 channels.

1045
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,240
These, by the way, are already human-approved anti-epileptics.

1046
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:37,640
And what happens is that the animals are repaired.

1047
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,760
They get their brains back.

1048
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,600
They not only get their normal anatomy back,

1049
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,400
but they get their IQs back.

1050
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,560
They are, in terms of learning rate,

1051
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,440
they are now indistinguishable from controls,

1052
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,200
whereas these guys could barely move.

1053
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,880
And so what you see here is that some disorders,

1054
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,920
and I'm not saying this is true for all of them,

1055
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:58,640
but for some disorders, really nasty hardware problems

1056
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,240
can, in fact, be fixed in software.

1057
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:04,240
All we did was temporarily open a particular ion channel

1058
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,840
to trigger this kind of improvement

1059
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,880
of the native bioelectrical pattern.

1060
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:13,880
So the whole pipeline looks something like this,

1061
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,520
where we will have a system,

1062
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,560
and you can already play with an early version of this online,

1063
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:23,560
where you choose the tissues or organs that you're interested in,

1064
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,480
whether normal or cancerous.

1065
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,880
It knows all the ion channels that are expressed there,

1066
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:31,200
because these are all present in databases and the literature.

1067
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,680
And then there's the simulator,

1068
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,360
which tells you which of these channels

1069
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,440
you would need to open or close

1070
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,440
to get this back to the correct state.

1071
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,080
And that allows you, once you know which channels,

1072
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,160
that allows you to pick a drug,

1073
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,680
because something like 20% of all drugs

1074
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,640
are ion channel drugs,

1075
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,800
which means there's a huge potential pool

1076
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,360
of so-called electroseuticals

1077
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:54,280
that can be used to infer

1078
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,840
how to make these changes from this computer model.

1079
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,880
Just one kind of quick piece of information

1080
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,640
to remind us that this is not all

1081
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,000
just for these lower animals that we work with.

1082
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,640
All of these different ion channels,

1083
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,160
which work exactly the same way

1084
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,880
in that some of our model systems

1085
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:14,120
have all come out of channelopathy studies in human patients.

1086
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,720
And in fact, if you look at the gene expression

1087
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:21,760
downstream of various bioelectrical interventions,

1088
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,680
as we did here,

1089
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:28,000
the genes downstream of frog axolotl

1090
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,840
and human mesenchymal stem cells are overlapping.

1091
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,000
So the targets are all the same.

1092
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,360
So this is a very ancient,

1093
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,960
highly conserved system for body regulation.

1094
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,680
And we have a lot of confidence

1095
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,760
because of what we learn now in animal models

1096
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:44,120
is gonna work well in medicine.

1097
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:46,720
So just for a couple of minutes,

1098
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:50,400
the last story I wanna tell you is about cancer.

1099
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,560
So what we have here, again,

1100
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,360
let's just remind ourselves what bodies are

1101
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:57,000
because the right question for cancer

1102
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,200
isn't why we get cancer.

1103
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,120
The right question is, I think,

1104
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,560
why isn't all cancer all the time?

1105
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,120
Why is there anything other than cancer?

1106
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:07,000
Because we are made of individual cells

1107
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,480
that used to be individual organisms

1108
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:13,080
that basically have two goals,

1109
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,680
to go wherever life is good,

1110
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,560
be metabolically and to proliferate

1111
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,840
for each cell to become two cells.

1112
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,200
But what evolution has done

1113
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,240
is given them some amazing hardware,

1114
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,560
including bioelectrical hardware,

1115
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,960
but also biochemical and biomechanical,

1116
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:26,800
that allows them to,

1117
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,280
instead of working on unicellular level,

1118
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,720
tiny little projects,

1119
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,560
what they do is they work towards something much bigger.

1120
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:36,520
They, together as a collective,

1121
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,320
they navigate anatomical space

1122
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,960
to build something like this.

1123
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:40,800
And if it gets damaged,

1124
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,880
they will rebuild it very much like ants do

1125
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,360
for an ant colony and so on.

1126
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,120
They continue to build something very large,

1127
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:50,880
but this whole system has a failure mode,

1128
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,720
and that failure mode is cancer.

1129
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,400
This is glial blastoma in vitro.

1130
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,560
What happens is that when individual cells

1131
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,800
get disconnected from this collective,

1132
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:06,160
they go back to their ancient unicellular past.

1133
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,280
As far as they're concerned,

1134
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,160
the rest of the body is external environment.

1135
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,440
They're no more selfish than the rest of your body cells

1136
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:14,640
is just that their cells are smaller.

1137
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:19,640
Cancer is a reduction of the diameter of the self.

1138
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,920
So from something very large,

1139
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,960
where they're all part of building this one organ,

1140
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:26,360
now it shrinks down to the level of a single cell,

1141
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:29,040
and it just goes to pursue little single cell agendas.

1142
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,000
So what we decided to do

1143
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,800
was to use this kind of very strange way of thinking about it

1144
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,240
to develop a therapeutic.

1145
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:40,240
And so here are these tumors that are injected,

1146
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,240
that are caused by injecting human oncogenes,

1147
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,840
for example, nasty K-RAS mutants and so on.

1148
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:47,400
And you can see here, the oncogen is labeled.

1149
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,360
It's in red.

1150
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,680
It's very strong in this area.

1151
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:50,680
In fact, it's all over the place.

1152
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:51,840
This is the same animal.

1153
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
There's no tumor,

1154
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,240
because even though if you were to sequence this genetically,

1155
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,400
you would see the mutation, you would say,

1156
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,080
ah, well, this is of course gonna be a tumor here.

1157
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:02,560
There isn't any tumor despite them.

1158
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:03,560
The oncogen is still there.

1159
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:04,400
We haven't gotten rid of it.

1160
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,560
It's quite strong,

1161
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:08,440
but the cells, we force the cells to electrically

1162
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:11,360
remain connected to the rest of the tissue

1163
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:14,920
by including an ion channel that sets a particular voltage.

1164
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:18,080
And we've basically forced them to remain part

1165
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:20,480
of this construction project that builds nice skin

1166
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,200
and nice muscle, regardless of what the oncogene is telling

1167
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,320
it to do, which is to disconnect and go off on your own.

1168
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,080
So you can see that, and so we're now,

1169
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:32,640
we're currently in human glioblastoma kind of applications

1170
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,680
to see if we can transition this to medicine.

1171
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:39,240
So I'm gonna just summarize and then give you a couple

1172
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:42,720
of bigger thoughts.

1173
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,880
So what I've tried to argue is that

1174
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,720
there's a physiological software layer

1175
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,120
that sits between the genotype and the anatomy.

1176
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:52,840
And it's a really important tractable target for biomedicine.

1177
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:56,400
It's not all about the molecular details of the genome.

1178
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,600
There's actually this physiological layer that's critical.

1179
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:02,600
Evolution discovered very early on how powerful

1180
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:05,240
the electrical component is of that layer

1181
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:08,360
and lots of cells hack each other's behavior

1182
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,320
by controlling these large scale electrical patterns.

1183
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:16,120
We think that cracking this code in the sense of neural,

1184
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,000
in the same sense as neural decoding

1185
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,480
will reveal how cell networks and tissues

1186
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,840
make group decisions.

1187
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,360
And so we already have applications

1188
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,840
where we can rewrite these pattern memories

1189
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:31,600
to program new large scale shapes.

1190
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,240
And there's some really exciting AI tools

1191
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,720
that are coming online for the design

1192
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:39,040
of specific strategies for regenerative medicine.

1193
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,880
So this is going to be anything

1194
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,920
that's going to help us control real time growth and form

1195
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,600
is going to be really critical for the aging problem.

1196
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,880
And in bigger picture,

1197
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,960
I think that bioelectrical signaling

1198
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,280
is very much like it does in the brain,

1199
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,160
serves as a kind of cognitive glue

1200
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,720
that binds individual cells towards larger purpose,

1201
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:04,320
which is to maintain an organism against disorder,

1202
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:07,200
which is aging cancer and everything else.

1203
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,600
So kind of the last thing I just want to mention

1204
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:14,720
is if we look at the space of all biomedical interventions,

1205
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:18,000
you've got basically bottom up conventional strategies

1206
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,120
which are all of these kind of hardware focus things.

1207
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,800
And then you've got some ways to treat this top down.

1208
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:28,000
And this is only now beginning to be sort of exploited.

1209
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,360
And you can see lots more in these papers.

1210
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:35,200
But this is where we get to take advantage

1211
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,520
of the native intelligence of cells and tissues.

1212
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,120
The fact that they're not just clockwork,

1213
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,600
they have specific,

1214
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,680
because they used to be independent organisms,

1215
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,920
they have preferences, they have competencies,

1216
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,600
they have memory, they have trainability,

1217
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,760
I haven't even mentioned all of those,

1218
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,400
the data for all of that.

1219
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:54,680
But there's a large field of emerging information on that.

1220
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,680
And really being able to take advantage of it

1221
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,160
is extremely powerful.

1222
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,720
And this is key.

1223
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:04,080
People who study placebo effects and expectation effects

1224
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:05,160
and really at this point,

1225
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:09,160
anybody who studies any kind of drug action

1226
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,000
has realized that the mind plays

1227
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,800
a really important part in this.

1228
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,080
And so Fabrizio Benedetti has this great quote that I love,

1229
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,360
which is that words and drugs

1230
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,120
have the same mechanism of action.

1231
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,120
And he literally uses a brain scanning

1232
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,400
and those kinds of technologies

1233
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,240
to really show the mechanism of action

1234
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,920
of having expectations about what various pharmaceuticals

1235
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,840
do versus what the actual pharmaceutical does.

1236
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,320
And I think that bioelectricity

1237
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:35,360
is an incredibly attractive target

1238
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,040
as a communication interface

1239
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,000
between large scale intelligence,

1240
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,960
between your expectations of these contextual

1241
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,200
of behavioral cues, which is what informs a lot of,

1242
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:51,520
whether a lot of how successful certain pharmaceuticals

1243
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:55,080
are going to be and the actual molecular level outcomes.

1244
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:59,720
Because as a human being or as any other animal,

1245
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,280
your decision to get out of bed in the morning,

1246
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,680
this high level kind of executive decision

1247
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,320
of what you want to do,

1248
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:07,880
has to filter down to change the molecular properties

1249
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:09,880
of the cell membrane in your muscle cells.

1250
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:10,720
In order to get out of bed,

1251
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,560
you have to depolarize those muscle cells.

1252
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,960
And so that bioelectric interface

1253
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:19,800
is literally what takes a high level content

1254
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:23,960
of an intelligent metacognitive individual

1255
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:27,640
and converts it into changes of molecular signaling

1256
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:28,720
within the cells.

1257
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,400
And with bioelectricity is what does that.

1258
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:35,280
And if we understood really how to manipulate that pathway,

1259
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,480
we could have really, really radical medical applications

1260
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,280
that are completely different than trying to cobble together

1261
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:44,040
the addressing of symptoms bottom up

1262
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,160
via drug design and things like that.

1263
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,000
So I'll stop here.

1264
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,400
I'm gonna thank all the students and postdocs

1265
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,280
who did all the work and my many collaborators.

1266
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,960
Again, three disclosures.

1267
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,640
These are companies that we work with.

1268
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:00,320
Our other funders are here

1269
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,320
and most of all the model systems

1270
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,760
because the animals do all the heavy lifting here.

1271
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:05,800
So thank you.

1272
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,800
I'll stop here and take any questions.

1273
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:15,160
I just want to say, wow, that was great.

1274
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,600
Thank you so much.

1275
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:17,440
Thank you.

1276
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,960
Absolutely fantastic.

1277
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:20,920
I appreciate it.

1278
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:21,760
Thank you.

1279
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,360
That was amazing.

1280
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:24,560
Yes, thank you.

1281
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:26,840
Michael, yeah, mind-blowing stuff.

1282
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:27,880
Hi, how are you doing?

1283
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,040
Hello.

1284
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,240
Yeah, I've been meaning to ask you

1285
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:35,360
and just trying to get my head around this bioelectric pattern

1286
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:36,840
that you're referring to.

1287
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:40,680
So how is it distributed across the organism?

1288
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:43,520
You have different ion channels active

1289
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,680
in different parts of the organism.

1290
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,640
How do you set it up?

1291
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:54,600
Yeah, that's true in that there are, of course,

1292
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:57,440
regionalizations of ion channel expression.

1293
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,200
But that isn't the major part of it

1294
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:04,520
because remember that if you imagine a field of cells

1295
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:07,240
where every cell has exactly the same ion channels,

1296
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:09,040
exactly the same ion channels,

1297
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,560
you can still have all kinds of complex patterns

1298
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:15,080
of bioelectric states because of self-organization

1299
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:18,160
of think of touring patterns and the chemical.

1300
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,320
So this is very familiar to people

1301
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:21,360
who think about chemical signals.

1302
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,960
You can have a well-mixed medium

1303
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,880
where all the chemicals are homogenous

1304
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:27,400
and yet you can have these very complex

1305
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,760
self-organizing patterns.

1306
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:31,120
Exactly the same thing is true in the bioelectric circuits.

1307
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:34,080
You don't need to necessarily have different ion channels

1308
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,840
to have different electrical states.

1309
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:40,680
You can self-organize very kind of clever patterns.

1310
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:44,040
But on top of that is overlay the fact that actually,

1311
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:46,000
yes, some cells do have different ion channels

1312
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:46,840
than other cells.

1313
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:52,720
But when you control like where the eye goes, for example,

1314
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,840
you go and localize your ion channel

1315
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:58,880
and the state of these channels.

1316
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,520
So yeah, so yeah, there's two ways.

1317
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:04,000
There's two, we have two applications that I showed you.

1318
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,320
One is, yeah, in a case of the eye,

1319
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:10,400
we inject the channel RNA into a specific region

1320
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,080
because that's where we want the eye to form.

1321
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:14,440
So there's some localization there.

1322
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:16,640
On the other hand, for example,

1323
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,280
in the work that we did to induce,

1324
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:22,040
let's say tail regeneration in a tap hole

1325
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:24,000
that normally won't regenerate it,

1326
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,280
we soak the whole animal and only the wound at the tail

1327
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,360
is what actually regenerates.

1328
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,800
We didn't provide any spatial specificity

1329
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:34,000
and that's because there's also an element

1330
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,080
and this is something else that's sort of stolen

1331
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:38,560
from neuroscience here is there's an element

1332
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:39,720
of attention in the system.

1333
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,760
So the cells that are not injured

1334
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,640
that are in a quiescent location where everything is good,

1335
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,720
they ignored our signal completely.

1336
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,640
And so it's only the cells at the wound

1337
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,920
that need to know what to do that actually responded

1338
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,040
and they grew a tail, the rest of it didn't did nothing.

1339
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:56,680
And we have many, many examples of that actually.

1340
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,120
The same thing for those,

1341
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:00,760
for the anti-epileptics to repair the brain,

1342
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:03,200
we didn't inject them in a specific location.

1343
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,920
We soak the whole animal and the brain was repaired

1344
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:06,760
and everything else.

1345
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:10,280
In fact, in fact, other things got slightly better.

1346
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,120
That's a whole other thing is that it's actually

1347
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:15,640
a tune up for the whole organism, other organs,

1348
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:18,040
developmental noise, which is like this variation,

1349
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:21,200
normal variation, all of that got crunched down

1350
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:25,400
into these embryos look like, I had scored them myself

1351
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:28,720
when I first saw this effect, I looked at it myself,

1352
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,280
they look like they come off an assembly line.

1353
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:32,200
I mean, it would just like perfect,

1354
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,080
like every, each one was exactly like each other

1355
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,880
just reduces the noise.

1356
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:40,160
So we didn't have to produce any spatial specificity there.

1357
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:42,720
Do wounds have electrical signals?

1358
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:43,720
Sorry?

1359
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:46,320
Do wounds emit electrical signals?

1360
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,160
Yes, yes.

1361
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,720
This has been studied, I believe the first work on this

1362
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:53,160
was like in the 1880s or something.

1363
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,080
Yes, absolutely.

1364
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:57,120
So every epithelial layer has a voltage across it.

1365
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:59,120
And if you poke a hole in it, it'll short circuit

1366
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:01,440
and all the cells nearby know where the wound is

1367
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,240
by following the electric field lines.

1368
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,800
And these things have been measured by,

1369
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:08,000
I think Emil Dubois Ramon was the first to measure this

1370
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,200
in the late 1800s.

1371
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,840
This has been around for a long time.

1372
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:14,240
We've had several questions in the chat queue

1373
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:15,640
that I'd like to get to now.

1374
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:19,800
I noticed Miles has had his hand up, he organized this.

1375
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,800
So he gets priority, Miles.

1376
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:26,600
And I don't recall who was asking another question

1377
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:30,320
that may have been Paul or someone will,

1378
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,760
we'll get back to you, Miles.

1379
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,000
Thank you, Johnny.

1380
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,320
I don't claim the probability, but thank you very much.

1381
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:42,480
Dr. Levine, sorry, I'm from British,

1382
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:45,760
British expression in South Africa, we say Levine.

1383
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,800
But okay, the two things I wanted to talk about

1384
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:53,000
was neural cellular automator.

1385
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,360
Neural, if I don't know if you've come across the term

1386
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:58,640
because they say they are inspired by your work.

1387
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:02,360
So there's this distilled.pub.

1388
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,720
That was our paper.

1389
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:06,560
Yeah, yeah.

1390
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:10,400
We collaborated with Alex Mardvintsov's team.

1391
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,960
Yeah, I know the papers you made.

1392
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,200
Okay, thank you, thank you.

1393
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,960
So that's the one thing.

1394
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,680
So that then I'm, that's answered my question.

1395
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:20,080
So that's basically modeling the same thing in software.

1396
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:24,560
And the other question was that we have a paper from

1397
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:28,320
Judd Hough, I think it was 2019,

1398
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:31,400
showing that in the adult, in the adult,

1399
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:36,240
the human adult, any mammal or eukaryote,

1400
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:39,720
there is the embryonic program

1401
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:44,720
and the fetal program of development in the genome,

1402
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:47,200
but it is switched off.

1403
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,920
And they've been able to, well, I suppose,

1404
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,120
look at the Yamanaka factors,

1405
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:55,840
in a sense they seem to be switching them on again.

1406
00:58:55,840 --> 00:59:00,160
So the embryonic program and the fetal program

1407
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:03,640
are switched off, they are called hypo, hypo methylated.

1408
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,280
I don't know if you're familiar with this or what?

1409
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,440
We also familiar with this.

1410
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:10,560
Okay, then that also answers my question.

1411
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:17,680
Yeah, I mean, the thing with the Yamanaka factors

1412
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,440
is that what you're doing there

1413
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:22,960
is regulating single cell state.

1414
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,840
So you're telling one cell

1415
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:27,400
that it's a primitive embryonic-like cell

1416
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:30,160
and from there, that cell needs to be able

1417
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:31,760
to figure out what to do by itself.

1418
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:33,720
The problems that we've been talking about

1419
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:35,560
are not single cell problems.

1420
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:37,720
They are large-scale morphogenetic problems

1421
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:42,720
and if all you do is set up a bunch of undifferentiated cells

1422
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:46,880
without the proper anatomical cues,

1423
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,280
what you will end up with is at best the teratoma

1424
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:52,680
or some other kind of a tumor that grows out of control.

1425
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,800
It's not enough to have,

1426
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,920
the cells themselves are like the building blocks.

1427
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:58,920
Yes, you need undifferentiated cells

1428
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:00,280
to make the various tissues,

1429
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,120
but it isn't enough.

1430
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:02,480
By themselves, you will not get

1431
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,880
the three-dimensional correct patterning.

1432
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,400
So I think that obviously the Yamanaka factors

1433
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,600
are incredibly interesting and important as a technology,

1434
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:13,960
but it doesn't provide the answer

1435
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:14,800
to what we're looking for.

1436
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:15,640
I don't think.

1437
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:19,160
All right.

1438
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:20,000
Thank you very much.

1439
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:20,840
Thank you very much.

1440
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:21,680
Just one last comment.

1441
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:22,520
Oh yeah.

1442
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:23,640
The doctors in play at Harvard,

1443
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:27,760
they show that when they crush the optic nerve in a mouse,

1444
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:30,960
the same biochemical pathways were stimulated

1445
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:34,680
as during the OSK Yamanaka factors.

1446
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,200
So it's as if the wound

1447
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:38,480
had the same effect as the reprogramming.

1448
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,120
Yeah, yeah, I'm not surprised.

1449
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:45,240
I mean, yes, and I know David's worked quite well.

1450
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:46,240
I'm not surprised.

1451
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,440
I think that's a fantastic finding.

1452
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:51,400
And I think that that's the right way to do this.

1453
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:56,240
In other words, it's the cellular environment

1454
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:58,280
and the pattern memories in that environment

1455
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,240
that are needed to tell the cells what to do.

1456
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:03,360
It's not enough to just have plastic cells bottom up.

1457
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:06,960
Very good.

1458
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,800
Justin's next in queue.

1459
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,200
Actually, kudos to Justin.

1460
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:15,880
He's doing some outstanding things in our community.

1461
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:20,880
He's been making videos lately

1462
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:25,000
and I was honored to present one on genomic analysis

1463
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,160
and longevity gene.

1464
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:29,720
So Justin, do you wanna read this or Dr. Levin?

1465
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:32,480
Do you wanna just read this yourself?

1466
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:35,880
It's up on the screen now.

1467
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:36,720
Yeah, I see it.

1468
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:44,360
Well, it's hard to say more influential.

1469
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:49,480
It's sort of like, I mean, they go hand in hand.

1470
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:51,920
It's the right way to think about this

1471
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:56,000
is using the framework of software and hardware.

1472
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,000
So without the right hardware,

1473
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,600
your software is not going to do anything.

1474
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:03,280
So hardware is really important

1475
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:04,400
and that's what the genetics does.

1476
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,440
The genetics nails down the cellular hardware

1477
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:07,560
that you have.

1478
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:11,200
However, if the hardware is good

1479
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:14,640
and biological hardware is definitely of that class,

1480
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,920
the hardware does not by itself

1481
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:18,320
determine what's going to happen.

1482
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:21,240
It's the actual software and the reprogrammability

1483
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:23,480
features that are going to determine what happens.

1484
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:25,400
And I showed you one example.

1485
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:26,760
Well, I showed you several examples

1486
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:29,200
where the physiology overrides the genetics.

1487
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:32,200
So you can make worms with the wrong species heads

1488
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:34,080
even though the genetics is normal.

1489
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:38,160
You can make animals with a very nasty oncogenic mutation

1490
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,320
which in fact do not get cancer

1491
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:42,880
even though the genetics are wrong.

1492
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:46,000
And you can have a notch mutation

1493
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,560
and still get a normal brain

1494
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:50,920
if the electrophysiology is managed correctly.

1495
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:53,200
So I'm certainly not going to say

1496
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,320
that genetics isn't important.

1497
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:56,240
It's critical.

1498
01:02:56,240 --> 01:03:00,600
But we now have ways to override the default behaviors

1499
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:02,160
that are given by the genetics.

1500
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:04,000
And I think we now have a better understanding

1501
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,640
of what the genetics does.

1502
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:07,040
It doesn't code directly

1503
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:09,520
for any of these form and functions.

1504
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,800
It's just the beginning of the control path.

1505
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:12,640
Okay.

1506
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:14,880
Yeah, I mainly ask that just because for so many years

1507
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:15,720
and years and years,

1508
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:18,000
so much funding has gone into genetics.

1509
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:23,040
And that's the solution to aging and rejuvenation.

1510
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:27,960
But it seems as though that's a minor part of the issue

1511
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:30,520
listening to you and seeing the work that you've done.

1512
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:33,400
Yeah, I hesitate to say minor.

1513
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:35,040
I think it's also going to be important

1514
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:38,400
because I can imagine sort of a two-part solution

1515
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:41,120
where you need both, right?

1516
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:44,920
So one can think about what actually happens

1517
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:45,840
during regeneration.

1518
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:49,480
Is it that cells are no longer remembering

1519
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:50,640
the correct pattern memories

1520
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:53,000
to keep up the tissues of the body?

1521
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,800
Or perhaps that information is there,

1522
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:56,840
but the cells are unable to execute.

1523
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,800
So we actually don't know the answer to that.

1524
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,960
And it's entirely possible that you will need both.

1525
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,560
You'll need a way to strengthen

1526
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:04,720
the bioelectric pattern memory.

1527
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:08,920
And you will need a way to improve the cells' abilities

1528
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:09,760
to obey.

1529
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:12,880
And that may be some kind of, you know,

1530
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:16,440
have a genetic or biochemical component to it.

1531
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:20,600
And Justin, was your next question answered?

1532
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:26,120
Yes, my next question was answered, that's right.

1533
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:28,680
Okay, next in line, John Kramer.

1534
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:32,240
And anyone who wants to ask a question verbally,

1535
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:36,000
please click the little hand raising icon

1536
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,200
and we'll put you in queue.

1537
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:43,280
Okay, John, okay, how did the planar get energy

1538
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:45,080
and biomass to regenerate?

1539
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:48,120
I have an idea, but Dr. Levin.

1540
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:51,640
Yeah, what happens is it's actually extremely interesting.

1541
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:56,640
These planarians, when the fragment starts to regenerate,

1542
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:01,400
it actually starts to shrink

1543
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,120
because it has to be the correct size

1544
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:04,920
to match the tiny little heads and tails

1545
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:05,840
that are gonna be formed, right?

1546
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:07,360
It's trying to keep proportional.

1547
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:10,120
So it shrinks and the way it shrinks is through autophagy.

1548
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:12,600
So it actually eats some of its own tissues

1549
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:15,760
and that ends up being used to rebuild.

1550
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:17,960
And in fact, even without injury,

1551
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:21,120
the worm is constantly remodeling.

1552
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:23,000
So if you starve it over months,

1553
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,480
they will just get smaller and smaller,

1554
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:26,080
but they keep perfect proportions.

1555
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:27,920
So they're constantly remodeling themselves.

1556
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,120
And once you feed them, they sort of get bigger

1557
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:34,120
and they stay in the right allometric scaling throughout.

1558
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:35,680
Amazing.

1559
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,160
All right, Jameson,

1560
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:42,000
which genes affected right after making changes?

1561
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,600
Yeah, so I can give you a whole list.

1562
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:48,320
We analyzed all this in several publications.

1563
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:50,040
So I can send you the list.

1564
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:52,800
There are many, all of the kinds of things

1565
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:53,640
that you've heard of.

1566
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:57,520
So Wnt pathway, BMP, FGF,

1567
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:01,480
all of those pathways are there, but it's thousands.

1568
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:04,640
There are many, many genes that are targeted.

1569
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:09,640
All right, John Kramer, Pacific Eye Unchained Drugs.

1570
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:12,240
Yeah, that depends on the drug.

1571
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:14,960
There are some drugs that are extremely dirty

1572
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:15,960
and non-specific.

1573
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:18,480
There are other drugs that are much more specific.

1574
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:23,040
The good news for some of these applications

1575
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:25,400
is that you actually don't want to be too specific

1576
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:30,400
because if you take, if you, let's say you block KV 2.1,

1577
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:33,760
well, KV 2.2 is right there to take its place.

1578
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,920
And so you sometimes want something

1579
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:37,640
that will take out a whole family or in fact,

1580
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:40,520
a whole class to make the change that you want.

1581
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:44,280
But it varies greatly across the different drugs.

1582
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:47,400
Okay.

1583
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:49,960
Paul.

1584
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:52,560
Yeah, I have a question with your,

1585
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:55,760
with respect to your hardware, software analogy,

1586
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:58,800
I've been in computer science for many, many, many years.

1587
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:01,800
So I know something about that.

1588
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:04,640
And Mike, it's more a comment from you

1589
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:09,640
because the difference I see between the biological things

1590
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:13,080
and computer software and hardware

1591
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:15,320
is that with computer hardware,

1592
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:19,840
the hardware doesn't generate and determine the software

1593
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:21,000
in any sense.

1594
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,720
In other words, you build a piece of hardware

1595
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:25,960
and you don't automatically get software programs

1596
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:27,560
that are running it, okay?

1597
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:31,720
So how does the, and so I want your comment is the idea

1598
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:36,480
of how does the genome and the basic biology

1599
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:39,360
generate the software in a sense?

1600
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:40,360
Yeah.

1601
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:42,920
So what you're saying is true

1602
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:46,680
with respect to the classic kind of architecture

1603
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:51,480
where those two things are quite separate, right?

1604
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:52,320
So you build a hardware

1605
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:54,120
and then somebody else has to put the software on it.

1606
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:57,480
That of course is only one type of computing device.

1607
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:01,480
So we now have self-organizing computational systems

1608
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:04,400
where nobody has to put the software on top.

1609
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:07,600
So this is the field of self-organizing robotics,

1610
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:11,520
artificial life, where we build these circuits that have a,

1611
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:16,040
so just imagine a collection of,

1612
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:19,240
we can start thinking about this as a collection

1613
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:23,160
of electronic components for a simple analog computer, right?

1614
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:24,680
When you've got the components,

1615
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:26,040
if you connect them up in the right way,

1616
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:27,720
you're going to get spontaneous behavior.

1617
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:30,480
The whole thing is an electronic dynamical system.

1618
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:32,600
It's going to have spontaneous behavior.

1619
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,640
And depending on what the components are,

1620
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:36,360
we can interpret that behavior

1621
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:37,880
as various kinds of computations.

1622
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:39,880
There's going to be inputs, there are going to be outputs

1623
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:43,320
and nobody had to explicitly program a thing.

1624
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:45,160
All of those computational behaviors

1625
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:48,720
are a feature of the dynamical components of the system.

1626
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:51,800
Now, the trick of course is to get the right components

1627
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:56,440
that take advantage of various laws of computation.

1628
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:59,600
The fact that, just to give you a simple example,

1629
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:01,240
these ion channels,

1630
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:04,040
there are voltage-gated current conductances.

1631
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:05,480
They're basically a transistor.

1632
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:08,480
So if you have a circuit in the right way,

1633
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:09,520
you can make logic gates.

1634
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:10,640
If you can make logic gates,

1635
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,320
then you have various computations.

1636
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:15,080
All of that is a kind of a dynamic,

1637
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:17,320
you can take a dynamical systems approach to it

1638
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:19,560
and think of it that way, but it's much more powerful

1639
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:21,960
if you actually ask what computations is it doing.

1640
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:26,960
So I think in biology, we have very well developed

1641
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,640
something that the computer technology

1642
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:30,720
is only just starting to exploit,

1643
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:34,000
which is self-organizing computational circuits.

1644
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,320
That's what I think we have.

1645
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:38,600
Robert, young, I like where you're going.

1646
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:41,600
Ideas for applying this to solve aging.

1647
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:47,960
Well, yeah, and I'm certainly not an aging expert.

1648
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:51,560
We don't have any work directly on aging yet.

1649
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:56,120
The idea is I think that the solution to aging

1650
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:58,440
is going to basically fall out of the solution

1651
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:02,000
to all of these other disorders of morphogenesis.

1652
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,600
I think that aging is fundamentally a disorder

1653
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,360
of morphogenetic control.

1654
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:11,120
And when we, and I don't mean just my lab at the field

1655
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:14,160
as a whole, when we solve this problem

1656
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:16,040
of maintaining morphogenetic control,

1657
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:17,960
aging will be one of the applications

1658
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:20,800
along with regeneration, along with cancer reprogramming

1659
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:21,640
and so on.

1660
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:26,200
I think the key is to ask how do the cells know

1661
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:27,800
what to do in the first place?

1662
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,280
And the solutions to that

1663
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:31,240
will be the solutions to aging as well.

1664
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:33,720
Very good.

1665
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:35,520
Next, another one from Jason.

1666
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,580
Let me adjust my screen.

1667
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:40,360
Mine was just more of a comment

1668
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:44,680
to Robert's question on how might be applied to aging.

1669
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:46,000
Okay.

1670
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:48,360
Jeff, Parker.

1671
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,000
Yeah.

1672
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,520
Yeah, so tissue regrowth after scarring.

1673
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:57,840
So we don't have any published data in mammals yet,

1674
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:02,120
but we did do work in the frog where we showed that

1675
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:05,120
even after it scars over with this,

1676
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:08,240
what they call a non-permissive epithelium,

1677
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:10,280
which normally doesn't allow the thing to regenerate,

1678
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:12,440
this like thick epithelium,

1679
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:14,040
we can still trigger regeneration.

1680
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:15,520
So I'm optimistic.

1681
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:19,080
But if you're asking about human patients,

1682
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:20,360
we don't have any data on that yet.

1683
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:21,200
So we'll see.

1684
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:23,560
Okay.

1685
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:26,080
And Jeff's next question.

1686
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:31,480
I've applied to common degenerative diseases of aging.

1687
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:35,440
Well, you may have applied to answer some of that.

1688
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:38,120
Yeah, yeah, again, I don't know.

1689
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:43,120
We don't have data on mammalian arthritis or COPD.

1690
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:46,480
We haven't done that,

1691
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:49,920
but I think that to the extent that we figure out

1692
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,440
where normal lung tissue comes from in the first place

1693
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:54,760
or what a normal joint is supposed to be,

1694
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:57,880
we will be able to trigger that regenerative process

1695
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:58,720
throughout.

1696
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:03,720
So my hope is to be able to continuously induce

1697
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:07,680
and up-regulate basically like what planaria do,

1698
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:10,600
where they're constantly refreshing their tissues

1699
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:11,440
all the time.

1700
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:14,760
Okay.

1701
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:21,280
Jason would be interested in seeing that map.

1702
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,640
Sorry, what map are we talking about?

1703
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:26,040
At one point you were talking about sort of a mapping

1704
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:30,600
between a bioelectric signal and a change in genes

1705
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,200
or a change in gene expression.

1706
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:33,480
Oh, gene expression, I see.

1707
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:35,880
Yeah, yeah, I can, yeah, that's fine.

1708
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:38,760
Drop me an email and I'll send you the paper.

1709
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:42,120
I'll warn you in advance that we did it

1710
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:44,640
because a lot of people are interested in that question,

1711
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:49,640
but I found it highly kind of uninformative

1712
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:55,200
because what it does is it tells you

1713
01:12:56,360 --> 01:13:00,960
how individual cells are altered by the bioelectrical change,

1714
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:04,400
but all the problems that we're actually interested in

1715
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:06,200
are not single cell problems.

1716
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:09,000
So knowing what happens to individual,

1717
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:15,800
what happens to the individual transcripts in single cells

1718
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:19,080
is that hasn't actually told us very much

1719
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:21,280
about how to control the whole business.

1720
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:25,480
So when you turn on the eye pattern,

1721
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:31,680
you see that you start to turn on all of the eye genes.

1722
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:34,760
So you get Paxix and Rick Swan and all of these things.

1723
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:36,680
Someone's microgones on and it's fading back.

1724
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:39,640
Hang on.

1725
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:43,000
Okay, we're good.

1726
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,840
Go ahead, please, sorry.

1727
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:46,280
Yep, no problem.

1728
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:49,000
So you see that those things are turned on,

1729
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,480
but what you'd really like to know

1730
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:52,840
is how did that collection of cells,

1731
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:54,640
it's not a single cell question,

1732
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:57,520
how did that whole field of cells take,

1733
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:00,120
convert that bioelectric pattern

1734
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:02,400
and decide that that maps onto an eye

1735
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,480
rather than some other organ?

1736
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:06,320
Not what happened to individual cells,

1737
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:08,920
but what's the large scale decoding?

1738
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:11,440
So we know the genes,

1739
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:14,240
but that doesn't actually answer the question.

1740
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:17,160
And so it's some of the other kinds of approaches

1741
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:19,920
that we've taken with large scale modeling

1742
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:21,920
and some of the machine learning and so on

1743
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:24,120
that are really going to answer this.

1744
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:26,440
Yeah, it seems like you sort of need a mapping

1745
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:28,560
then between a bioelectric signal

1746
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:31,680
and how it alters actual tissues or organs, right?

1747
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:32,520
That's exactly right.

1748
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:33,880
That's exactly right.

1749
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:35,200
That's the bioelectric code.

1750
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:37,320
That is precisely what we're trying to map out.

1751
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:38,960
Just a quick follow up.

1752
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:41,720
How do you see this area of research interfacing

1753
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:44,120
with areas like quantum biology?

1754
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:46,560
Yeah, good question.

1755
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:48,160
I've been asked that before.

1756
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:50,760
I don't know specifically for quantum biology.

1757
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:55,040
I'm not an expert in quantum anything and I don't know.

1758
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:57,560
So far, everything that we've been doing here

1759
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:59,080
is purely classical.

1760
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:04,080
We don't use any quantum formalisms yet.

1761
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:07,840
We basically just use standard neuroscience,

1762
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:09,280
standard electrophysiology

1763
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:13,120
and standard connectionist kinds of network modeling.

1764
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:14,240
So I don't know.

1765
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:18,640
I don't know if there's a role for quantum kinds of processes.

1766
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,880
I assume biology exploits it

1767
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:23,440
like it exploits everything else that it can,

1768
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:26,200
but our models don't include that right now.

1769
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:28,480
Thank you.

1770
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,680
Okay, a couple more questions in chat.

1771
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:39,120
I will copy them, but first I had one.

1772
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:42,280
How can we support your work?

1773
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:44,880
Well, thank you.

1774
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:49,520
I guess at this point, where the field is

1775
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:52,600
is that we know what to do.

1776
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:54,080
We're not stuck anywhere.

1777
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:57,560
There are no great fundamental blockades

1778
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:58,800
other than resources.

1779
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:01,440
So right now it's pretty scalable,

1780
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:03,520
meaning that if we had more people working on this,

1781
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:04,480
it would move faster.

1782
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:08,480
It's not every field is at that stage,

1783
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:09,680
but this one kind of is.

1784
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:13,200
So yeah, if you know of any leads on,

1785
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:18,200
and we have lots of potential sources for funding,

1786
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:23,400
but all of them take up significant time,

1787
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:26,360
the pursuit of research funding takes significant time.

1788
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:30,640
So any leads on that are helpful.

1789
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:33,360
That's basically the rate-limiting step at this point.

1790
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:40,520
Okay, I'm going to, since Miles has given so,

1791
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:44,360
oops, sorry, given so much of his time

1792
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:47,520
to organize this and other meetings, he gives priority.

1793
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:50,640
So are using any AI tools?

1794
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:56,200
Yeah, we use a variety of AI techniques.

1795
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:58,720
We don't really use any off-the-shelf tools

1796
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:00,200
that I can think of.

1797
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:02,880
We basically make most of our own.

1798
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:07,880
And the idea is to understand the decision-making

1799
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:13,600
and the memory of the cells themselves.

1800
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:14,880
So it's kind of a tight,

1801
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:18,400
we're not just using AI tools to crunch the data,

1802
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,960
we're actually trying to understand the cells

1803
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:23,120
as a kind of intelligence, you know,

1804
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:24,960
artificial or not that that kind of doesn't matter,

1805
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:27,480
but it's a kind of unconventional intelligence.

1806
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:29,920
And we're trying to use it.

1807
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:37,280
Yeah, Roy Cutler, good to see you again.

1808
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:43,920
And I'll reformat this.

1809
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:48,120
Are you able to reverse?

1810
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:49,560
You can read it.

1811
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:54,560
Yeah, sort of in the case of,

1812
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:58,720
so for example, in the case of the leg regeneration,

1813
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:01,000
that's part of what happens.

1814
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,080
It's not so much reversing.

1815
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:04,520
It's, you know, for example, in the frog,

1816
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:08,200
much like in the human, there's no de-differentiation.

1817
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:09,720
It just, skin makes more skin,

1818
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:12,040
muscle makes muscle, bone makes bone and so on.

1819
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:14,920
It induces tissue renewal and patterning.

1820
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:16,600
It's not so much,

1821
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:19,320
it's not so much necessarily a differentiation issue,

1822
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:21,880
but we have, for example, in vitro,

1823
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:26,280
you can control human mesenchymal stem cells that way.

1824
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:28,480
What we bi-electrically, you can control

1825
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:30,440
whether or not they differentiate.

1826
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:33,600
So this is one way to control differentiation,

1827
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:35,600
but that again, that's not really enough

1828
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:39,280
to, that's not where the power of the approach lies.

1829
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:42,280
And how are you set for time?

1830
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:44,720
Do you have time for a few more?

1831
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:46,560
I will tell you, what time is it?

1832
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:48,480
I got about five minutes.

1833
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,880
Okay, Jeff's question,

1834
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:54,400
and I will be reformatting another one or two

1835
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:55,560
that are in chat.

1836
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:58,680
Let's see, companies work well.

1837
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:02,960
What, yeah, I can't say too much other than we do,

1838
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:07,160
we do have this company called Morphosuticals Inc.

1839
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:12,160
And we're focusing on limb regeneration and stay tuned.

1840
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:14,440
There will be papers coming out,

1841
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:16,840
hopefully later this year.

1842
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:21,840
All right, John's, yeah, John's question, optical.

1843
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:25,240
Yeah, we've used optogenetics.

1844
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:27,400
We've used optogenetics to trigger regeneration,

1845
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:30,280
to trigger limb formation, to suppress cancer.

1846
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:34,120
Unclear to me whether that's gonna be really

1847
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:35,280
the way to go in the clinic,

1848
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:39,320
because it requires the cells to be expressing

1849
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:41,960
a light-gated ion channel,

1850
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:43,360
which is very good in the laboratory,

1851
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:44,920
because then you know exactly what you've done,

1852
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:46,280
and it's very nice.

1853
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:50,600
But you don't want to have to give your patient

1854
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:53,680
gene therapy to get those light-sensitive channels in there.

1855
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:57,680
So I'm not sure that will actually be how we do the clinic.

1856
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:04,040
Okay, and I was popping and I trust that includes

1857
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:08,400
an answer to John's second question.

1858
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:12,360
John Kramer, developing drugs and...

1859
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:15,240
Okay.

1860
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:18,680
Yeah, well, there's a huge amount of emphasis

1861
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:22,000
on discovering new drugs for ion channels.

1862
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,480
So lots of the big pharma companies are doing that

1863
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:27,600
for other reasons, not having anything to do

1864
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:32,320
with bioelectricity necessarily, but so yes,

1865
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:35,920
but that's not really the right limiting step right now.

1866
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:37,920
We have plenty of drugs for ion channels.

1867
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:40,800
I mean, we can always use more, but the issue isn't

1868
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:43,520
that we don't have enough drugs for specific channels.

1869
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:48,040
The issue largely is that we don't have enough physiomic data.

1870
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:53,040
So we need bioelectrical state data on a health and disease

1871
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:58,120
and a wide range of tissues across patients, all of that.

1872
01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:01,560
And then we can develop specific strategies.

1873
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:03,400
Cool.

1874
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:08,040
Let's see, next, John Wenger.

1875
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:12,600
And I see, I mean, you said five minutes,

1876
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:14,080
so I'm taking that literally,

1877
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:16,840
and I think we have about two and a half left.

1878
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:19,000
So I'm watching the clock here

1879
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,120
because I want to keep you on schedule.

1880
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:26,120
Yeah, we've never, I have no idea, in a planarian,

1881
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:28,760
we've never done anything like that,

1882
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:30,400
it's physically moving cells around.

1883
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:32,360
So I don't know what would happen.

1884
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:33,200
Okay.

1885
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:41,320
And Justin's question, in case you can't see it all,

1886
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:42,520
I'll reformat it.

1887
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:49,560
Yeah, I understand the question.

1888
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:51,880
I'm not sure we're gonna have to worry

1889
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:55,040
about the correct places in the correct period of time.

1890
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:58,480
In the frog, for example, we soak the whole animal

1891
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,040
and we do it for 24 hours

1892
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:01,600
and then we don't touch them again.

1893
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:04,440
And that is enough to trigger a year and a half

1894
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:07,000
of new organ growth in the correct place.

1895
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:11,480
And so my hope is that if we correctly understand

1896
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,800
if we correctly understand how the cells

1897
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:18,320
process this information,

1898
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:22,240
we're not gonna have to micromanage the delivery spatially.

1899
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:27,320
Yeah, the magnetic field of the earth.

1900
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:31,880
Well, so we know that the magnetic field

1901
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:33,440
is important for some things,

1902
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:36,440
as you say, like navigations and navigation,

1903
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:40,400
the kinds of electrical signals that we are working with,

1904
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:45,840
the weak field of the earth doesn't really impact them.

1905
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:47,400
I mean, people have done experiments

1906
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:50,200
where you shield them off from the magnetic field

1907
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:52,360
of the earth using new metal and things like that.

1908
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:55,400
And some people, there have been some effects reported,

1909
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:57,880
but it's not, it's really kind of,

1910
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:00,200
there's not this really strong evidence

1911
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:02,160
for the need of a magnetic field

1912
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:06,240
for the kinds of very, very kind of strong electrical exchanges

1913
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:07,440
that we're talking about.

1914
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:10,080
Hey.

1915
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:10,920
Outstanding.

1916
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:14,040
Thank you so much.

1917
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:15,880
Miles, quick one.

1918
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:18,000
Just the last question, just the last question,

1919
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:18,920
Dr. Levine.

1920
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:22,640
So if you wanted to control the electric field

1921
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:26,200
down to a more granular level with you

1922
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:29,240
on the embryonic, during the embryonic stage,

1923
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:32,840
would you be looking at things like nanotechnology

1924
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:37,840
or sort of point conductors to sort of change

1925
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:40,080
the shape of the embryos?

1926
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:45,080
You could, but my own thinking is that that's,

1927
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:46,720
we actually want to go in the wrong,

1928
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:48,040
in the opposite direction.

1929
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:52,200
We don't want to be micromanaging the minute states.

1930
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:56,160
We want to have very low information content,

1931
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:59,440
large scale signals that let the cells themselves

1932
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:01,160
handle all of the details.

1933
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:02,440
In everything that we've done,

1934
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:04,560
the most powerful interventions are the ones

1935
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:06,400
where we leave the most to the cells,

1936
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:08,200
where we do not try to micromanage it.

1937
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:10,280
I'm sure there will be applications where that's useful,

1938
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:13,360
maybe especially in synthetic morphology,

1939
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:16,120
but I don't think that's long-term.

1940
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:17,920
I don't think that's the way here.

1941
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,720
Well, as some guy who used to travel around

1942
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:25,760
the galaxies on a starship used to say, fascinating.

1943
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:28,200
Thank you so much.

1944
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:29,120
Thank you so much, everybody.

1945
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:30,080
Great, great discussion.

1946
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:30,920
Really appreciate it.

1947
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:31,840
Thank you.

1948
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:32,680
Thanks.

1949
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:33,520
Bye-bye.

1950
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:34,360
Great job.

1951
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:35,200
Thank you.

1952
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,020
Thank you.

1953
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:39,400
Okay.

1954
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:43,960
If anyone has something else to say,

1955
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:45,520
it's going to be a hard act to follow.

1956
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:48,240
Any other thoughts, ideas?

1957
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:53,520
Next topic, Miles,

1958
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:58,600
I believe you had another thing or two to say.

1959
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:02,080
Yes, no, no, he caught the scientific community

1960
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:06,160
completely unprepared from left field.

1961
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:08,400
He totally, I think about 10, 15 years ago

1962
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:12,160
when he started, it was totally like Jason was saying,

1963
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:15,080
the focus was on the genes.

1964
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:18,600
And this level of control, which is comprehensive,

1965
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:23,600
it's the actual morphology was completely unexpected.

1966
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:28,160
So that's why, I mean, amazing is he's broken the barrier

1967
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:29,760
for organ formation.

1968
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:33,880
You see the extra limbs, the extra legs,

1969
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:36,320
you see them coming out of the frog.

1970
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:38,800
And that was a massive, massive advance.

1971
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,960
So he's really done something fantastic.

1972
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:47,300
Well, Miles, what was your next agenda item?

1973
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:52,760
Well, it was actually the next agenda item was after him,

1974
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:56,320
I did keep something else, which was the fact that

1975
01:25:56,320 --> 01:26:00,120
we have a complete, this has been a discovery in 2019,

1976
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:01,120
something very interesting,

1977
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:03,040
which I found very, very interesting.

1978
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:07,320
There is a complete record of the program

1979
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:12,320
of your embryonic stage and your fetal stage in your cells.

1980
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:16,840
You've got a record and it is not just there,

1981
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:21,880
it is carefully packed away and it is tagged, it's tagged.

1982
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:26,440
And it seems that the people from Harvard,

1983
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:29,440
Dr. St. Clair has been starting to talk about this now,

1984
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:31,560
because manipulating that program,

1985
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:34,680
which I think is what Dr. Levine's work is partially doing,

1986
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:38,640
he's busy manipulating this program that's packed away,

1987
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:40,520
is gonna be the next big thing,

1988
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:45,120
the next big thing in anti-aging and in medicine,

1989
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:46,400
in surgery.

1990
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:49,320
I was gonna to flash very quickly the relevant paper,

1991
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:52,340
if you don't mind, just quickly flash the paper.

1992
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:56,880
Let me just see which one was it.

1993
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:10,000
Oops.

1994
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:14,400
Sorry people, I'm just looking for my,

1995
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:18,720
okay, let me just check if I can see the paper.

1996
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:24,880
Yes, I don't know if you, can you see that?

1997
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:26,000
Yes.

1998
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:26,840
Are you able to see that?

1999
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:29,040
Is it over the place?

2000
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:32,520
Sorry, can you see the paper?

2001
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:35,240
Yes, it could be a little larger.

2002
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:39,200
Okay, no, I think Johnny, I'm using Linux tonight,

2003
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:42,240
I've had issues with my Windows computer,

2004
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:43,720
so I'm using Linux.

2005
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:46,480
So I think I'll just, if you can't see it,

2006
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:50,440
the title is Extensive Recovery of Embryonic Enhancer

2007
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:51,640
and Gene Memory.

2008
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:55,520
Gene memory stored in hypermethylated enhancer DNA.

2009
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:58,720
The title doesn't quite do justice to what they are

2010
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:02,120
describing because it's actually earth shattering.

2011
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:05,520
Basically what they're saying is your embryonic program

2012
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:08,920
is still with you, it's still packed away in your genome,

2013
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:10,600
as well as your fetal program,

2014
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:13,360
because there's a difference between the embryonic program

2015
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:16,320
and the fetal program, basically the embryo

2016
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:20,640
is formed in the first eight, first, what's it?

2017
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:24,200
Let me put it this way, the embryo is formed first

2018
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:27,800
up to about the eighth week of pregnancy

2019
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:30,280
and then after that you're a foetus.

2020
01:28:30,280 --> 01:28:33,160
And the two stages uses different sections

2021
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:35,480
of the genome to make you.

2022
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:37,680
And what's fantastic is that the program

2023
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:42,440
that was used to make you 98% of it is still in your DNA,

2024
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:45,840
carefully packed away and also tagged.

2025
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:47,200
So what people are starting to do

2026
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:49,320
is just sort of manipulate this program.

2027
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:51,240
And I think that's what Dr. Levine is doing,

2028
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:53,600
he's actually manipulating this program,

2029
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:56,080
which is why we see this perfect restarting

2030
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:57,880
of the growth of organs.

2031
01:28:57,880 --> 01:28:59,960
So that's something I wanted, I have not,

2032
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:01,200
I didn't put it on our group

2033
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:04,520
because I wasn't sure how long Dr. Levine would be.

2034
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:06,720
Maybe we can have another discussion later on,

2035
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:08,240
but I thought I'd just throw this in here

2036
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:10,720
because this is also quite earth shattering.

2037
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:15,200
The fact that you can rerun,

2038
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:17,720
you can rerun the development mental program

2039
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:19,800
because it is still in you.

2040
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:27,600
I don't know if there was any questions about that.

2041
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:28,440
Yeah.

2042
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:43,040
That's a big breakthrough, an important thing to know,

2043
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:48,040
and one component of the program to aging.

2044
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,040
Go ahead.

2045
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:51,960
Yes.

2046
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:53,560
Yeah, this is John Wenger.

2047
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:57,400
So I'm remembering,

2048
01:29:57,400 --> 01:30:00,760
I think it might have been from my introductory

2049
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:02,600
college zoology class,

2050
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:07,200
but there's a saying that with regard to development,

2051
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:09,200
and that I think was something like

2052
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:12,240
ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.

2053
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:15,560
I'm not even wondering about phylogeny.

2054
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:18,040
Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.

2055
01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:19,600
Phylogeny is right, yeah.

2056
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:23,200
Yeah, and the, and this seems relevant.

2057
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:25,840
I mean, it seems like what we're talking now,

2058
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:28,400
what you just said is a slight elaboration

2059
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:32,760
of that principle, namely that the whole genome

2060
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:35,360
is there for the different stages of development

2061
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:40,360
starting from an embryo to a fetus, et cetera, et cetera.

2062
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:45,720
And now people are trying to figure out

2063
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:48,400
how to replay parts of those things.

2064
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:54,400
The, it's really handy that all this,

2065
01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:01,560
these genetic patterns of development and our youths

2066
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:04,360
are preserved because as we get older,

2067
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:08,400
where our genome are controlling active,

2068
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:12,240
our current genome gets corrupted, we think.

2069
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:17,240
And so the idea of, and people talk about taking your,

2070
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:21,880
your genes and doing gene banking or your DNA banking

2071
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:23,320
and that sort of thing.

2072
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:27,400
Well, if it turns out that the younger DNA

2073
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:29,720
is still in our system somewhere,

2074
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:33,320
a different piece of the total genome,

2075
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:35,920
well, that's handy because then that gives you access

2076
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:39,800
to a younger genome and that obviously bears

2077
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:43,000
on the problem of aging reversal.

2078
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:47,640
Absolutely, yes, correct.

2079
01:31:47,640 --> 01:31:48,480
Absolutely.

2080
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:50,880
Which is exciting.

2081
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:55,600
Extremely, it's as if the biology has handed us a gift.

2082
01:31:57,400 --> 01:32:01,240
Yeah, well, it's not exactly the, I mean,

2083
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:06,240
it's, I don't think biology, yeah, it is as if the candidate

2084
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:12,600
is a gift, but in a sense, I mean,

2085
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:14,360
it's kind of interesting, it's always been there.

2086
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:16,600
We just need to open our eyes and look at it.

2087
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:18,400
That requires the right kind of eyes

2088
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:21,600
and the right kind of mind to be able to see that.

2089
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:26,600
But I really liked Michael's conception

2090
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:30,160
because I really think that genetics

2091
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:32,840
is sort of taken over biology.

2092
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:37,840
And I think he's right that the real intelligence,

2093
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:43,120
well, not all of the, all the information's not in the genome.

2094
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:49,240
There's something about what Heb called cell assemblies,

2095
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:51,800
the notion of where does intelligence come from?

2096
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:55,400
And the notion is that the neurons would organize

2097
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:57,920
into cell assemblies with various functions.

2098
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:02,440
And it's clear that different chunks of the body

2099
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:05,120
have their own internal intelligence.

2100
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:07,280
That's why I asked the question about what would happen

2101
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:12,280
if you took, injected some eye cells and some hearing cells.

2102
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:15,440
I don't even know if Plenaria can hear,

2103
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:18,480
but how would they determine whether to grow an eye

2104
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:23,160
or an ear, sort of Plenaria ear in the same place?

2105
01:33:23,160 --> 01:33:28,160
Well, these organizational fields would have to,

2106
01:33:28,160 --> 01:33:32,760
in some sense, either fight it out or coexist.

2107
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:35,960
And maybe they would segregate themselves voluntarily.

2108
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:40,360
And so you'd have an eye in the tail and an ear in the tail,

2109
01:33:40,360 --> 01:33:42,800
not in the very same spot, but nearby,

2110
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:45,040
not in the head, but back in the tail.

2111
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:48,920
And so I really think that he's really onto it.

2112
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:51,840
I mean, it's so, it's just mind blowing.

2113
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:54,840
It's such an important discovery

2114
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:59,080
because there's so much information.

2115
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:02,280
That's why I was asking the question too about the optics.

2116
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:04,040
In one of his earlier slides,

2117
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:05,480
and Johnny, you did have this recorded.

2118
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:07,240
I really hope you can see this.

2119
01:34:07,240 --> 01:34:09,320
I'd like to look at his slides some more.

2120
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:14,320
There was an optogenetic term in one of his manipulations there,

2121
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:18,600
but it strikes me that there may be,

2122
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:20,360
just as there are electrical ways,

2123
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:23,000
he's manipulating with electrical fields,

2124
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,720
but there are other fields too, there are optical fields.

2125
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:30,720
And the bigger picture might be the combined manipulation

2126
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:34,480
with electrical fields and optical fields.

2127
01:34:35,480 --> 01:34:40,480
Because nature is very, very clever

2128
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:43,480
at using things in combination.

2129
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:47,720
I think that's sort of the point of his talk.

2130
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:50,320
So I've kind of gone up for a little bit here,

2131
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:52,400
but I hope I've stimulated a few thoughts.

2132
01:34:54,360 --> 01:34:58,240
I'm finding, I found that talk to be really

2133
01:34:58,240 --> 01:35:02,040
changing my perspective on the direction we've been going.

2134
01:35:02,040 --> 01:35:05,440
It almost seems like our focus on drugs

2135
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:08,280
and even gene editing in CRISPR,

2136
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:12,440
we're still reprogramming the computer with a soldering iron.

2137
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:13,280
That's right.

2138
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:15,800
That's absolutely right.

2139
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:20,960
Approach is no, we're gonna create software to change life.

2140
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:25,440
And it's pretty mind-boggling.

2141
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:28,400
I think the issue is not that we should be creating,

2142
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:29,800
we should be creating the software,

2143
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:33,040
we should be locating the software that's already in us

2144
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:36,200
and exploiting that software and giving it a chance

2145
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:37,960
to function in an older body

2146
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:40,160
as it functioned in a younger body.

2147
01:35:40,160 --> 01:35:41,960
I think the software is already in us.

2148
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:46,960
If our genome contains our fetal plan

2149
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:53,200
and our embryonic plan, our fetal plan, et cetera,

2150
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:57,520
and our infant plan and the child plan

2151
01:35:57,520 --> 01:35:59,640
and the teenager plan and the adult plan,

2152
01:35:59,640 --> 01:36:02,560
if it's all in there for the cells,

2153
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:05,120
then it's also in there for the software.

2154
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:06,360
Why would it not be?

2155
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:08,480
If the genome contains all of that,

2156
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:11,840
then it probably also contains the ability

2157
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:15,200
to read the associated software with it.

2158
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:17,400
That is to say the software is a property

2159
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:22,400
of the ensemble of the cells.

2160
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:24,480
Yeah, well, I'd like to offer a thought.

2161
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:27,440
I am an electrical engineer by training.

2162
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:31,640
I've worked with circuits and also quite a bit with software.

2163
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:35,240
This is nothing like hardware and software.

2164
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:37,440
This is something different.

2165
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:40,200
I think we can at the conceptual level

2166
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:43,080
think about higher level controls,

2167
01:36:43,080 --> 01:36:48,080
but if you look at all the mechanisms

2168
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:51,760
for synthesizing proteins for replication,

2169
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:55,560
that's not hardware or software,

2170
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:59,880
and bears a lot of thought.

2171
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:02,120
I mean, there are some very high level,

2172
01:37:02,120 --> 01:37:07,120
long state machines in the biology.

2173
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:12,080
So how this whole field pattern,

2174
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:16,640
biological appearance communicates with that

2175
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:17,680
is very interesting,

2176
01:37:17,680 --> 01:37:21,440
but I wouldn't oversimplify it with that comparison.

2177
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:23,160
Good.

2178
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:26,640
Can you hear me now?

2179
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:28,280
Can we get rid of the slides?

2180
01:37:28,280 --> 01:37:29,120
Yes.

2181
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:32,240
In a moment, can you hear me now?

2182
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:35,680
Okay, because my expensive Yeti microphone cut off again,

2183
01:37:35,680 --> 01:37:39,360
so I guess I'll have to reinstall the drivers or something.

2184
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:44,360
Robert had a really great question that brings us back.

2185
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:47,440
So just how are we gonna use this to solve aging?

2186
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:49,200
Does anyone have any ideas?

2187
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:55,280
I was dropping in the chat a few of my thoughts there too.

2188
01:37:56,280 --> 01:37:59,320
Yeah, I think with this approach,

2189
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:02,680
it just depends on how detailed your map is.

2190
01:38:02,680 --> 01:38:07,680
I mean, if you know with one electrical signal

2191
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:10,040
that it would have a certain physiological,

2192
01:38:10,040 --> 01:38:11,840
biological response,

2193
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:15,160
and you had that across every type of signal

2194
01:38:15,160 --> 01:38:17,320
and every type of response,

2195
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:19,800
you could start rejuvenating entire organs

2196
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:22,800
and in turn rejuvenating entire organ systems.

2197
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:27,160
So yeah, and actually the target,

2198
01:38:27,160 --> 01:38:29,520
the target that I'm most interested in

2199
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:32,960
is actually the circulatory system, right?

2200
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:34,080
Like your cardiovascular

2201
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:36,200
and then your musculatory organ system.

2202
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:37,720
So it's really two,

2203
01:38:37,720 --> 01:38:39,600
and you really have to use it in combination

2204
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:43,040
with other therapies because at the end of the day,

2205
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:45,200
like someone was alluding to,

2206
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:48,040
you have some hardware,

2207
01:38:48,040 --> 01:38:49,880
you have some hardware, whatever it is,

2208
01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:53,720
but how do the electrical signals detect?

2209
01:38:55,160 --> 01:38:57,200
How do you actually target specific things?

2210
01:38:57,200 --> 01:39:00,760
And it turns out that certain proteins in the body

2211
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:04,360
can actually be like,

2212
01:39:04,360 --> 01:39:06,840
think about like within like photosynthesis, for example,

2213
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:08,920
there's certain proteins and plants

2214
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:13,200
that are using light to do some kind of chemical reaction.

2215
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:15,640
And it turns out in the body, they're the similar thing.

2216
01:39:15,640 --> 01:39:19,080
So you essentially have to use like a combination

2217
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:25,240
of peptides and other things with these frequencies

2218
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:28,400
to be able to actually rejuvenate entire organ.

2219
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:32,920
But that would be the approach that I would suggest.

2220
01:39:32,920 --> 01:39:33,760
Very good.

2221
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:36,040
John Kramer had a question.

2222
01:39:36,040 --> 01:39:39,600
Yeah, it seems to me that the problem

2223
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:43,560
of applying this to aging is that really you need a map

2224
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:47,760
to decide which ion channels need to be open and closed

2225
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:50,000
in order to produce given effects.

2226
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:54,360
There may be, if we're lucky, there may be an ion channel

2227
01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:56,680
that you can open that sort of causes the whole body

2228
01:39:56,680 --> 01:40:00,120
to go into an anti-age or age reversal situation.

2229
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:03,320
So this really needs to be studied in great detail.

2230
01:40:03,320 --> 01:40:06,040
And I'm pleased to hear from what he said

2231
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:09,440
that there are a large number of drugs

2232
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:10,560
that are now being developed,

2233
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:12,560
which have effects on ion channels.

2234
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:16,560
And so one needs to sort of cross correlate those drugs

2235
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:18,520
with the effects that they have in order to find out

2236
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:20,200
what's going on in mammals.

2237
01:40:20,200 --> 01:40:24,480
And apparently, plenaria are fine,

2238
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:27,840
but they bear very little resemblance to us.

2239
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:31,720
And so we really need a lot of experimentation,

2240
01:40:31,720 --> 01:40:35,520
apparently, investigation of what ion channels

2241
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:37,280
do what in mammals.

2242
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:38,680
And if we can do that,

2243
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:42,760
we might make real progress towards dealing with aging.

2244
01:40:42,760 --> 01:40:44,600
Excellent.

2245
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:48,680
Does anyone here not know how to raise your hand

2246
01:40:48,680 --> 01:40:51,240
with the little reactions?

2247
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:54,040
I'm just trying to figure that out.

2248
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:56,840
Okay, on the bottom,

2249
01:40:59,200 --> 01:41:04,200
if you move your cursor to the bottom of your Zoom screen,

2250
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:06,840
it may be up already, it may pop up,

2251
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:11,840
but you will see mute, stop video, some other things.

2252
01:41:12,120 --> 01:41:14,040
Now, farther to the right,

2253
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:18,160
to the right of the green share screen is reactions.

2254
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:23,160
If you hover over that, there is a raise hand.

2255
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:27,560
That puts you to the front on my screen.

2256
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:33,360
And okay, well.

2257
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:34,440
You're not finding it.

2258
01:41:34,440 --> 01:41:37,120
Yeah, let's do this.

2259
01:41:37,120 --> 01:41:39,760
Miles had a question, then you.

2260
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:42,600
And does anyone else not know how to do that?

2261
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:43,760
There you go.

2262
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:45,320
There you go.

2263
01:41:45,320 --> 01:41:46,880
Okay.

2264
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:48,440
All right, I didn't hear that.

2265
01:41:48,440 --> 01:41:52,120
So just so we can take everyone in order

2266
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:55,320
and everyone gets a turn, let's do it that way.

2267
01:41:55,320 --> 01:41:57,360
Miles, please.

2268
01:41:57,360 --> 01:41:58,240
Thank you.

2269
01:41:58,240 --> 01:42:03,240
Just to answer, John, John Cramer, the OSKM,

2270
01:42:05,120 --> 01:42:08,880
the Yamanaka Factors, they are combinatorial.

2271
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:10,800
And if you remember the experiments,

2272
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:13,360
Professor Yamanaka and all these collaborators

2273
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:17,800
tried many combinations until they eat the right combination

2274
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:22,240
which was extremely, it was an extreme reaction

2275
01:42:22,240 --> 01:42:25,240
from the embryo, the animal,

2276
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:27,640
because it went right back to the embryonic state,

2277
01:42:27,640 --> 01:42:29,160
which was, this is radical.

2278
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:31,960
I mean, normally, normal animals just don't do this.

2279
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:35,200
So it was a needle in a stack,

2280
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:38,760
and it was not easy there to try many, many combinations.

2281
01:42:38,760 --> 01:42:41,400
And I think the same thing is gonna happen here.

2282
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:43,360
Something similar, you mentioned

2283
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:45,280
that he's got a cocktail already.

2284
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:47,520
I think that cocktail is fairly complex.

2285
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:50,880
And as you get to higher up mammals and so forth,

2286
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:54,880
I think that cocktail is more complex than for the worms.

2287
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:57,920
So that's my comment on your comment.

2288
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:01,480
The other one, Fiona, I also studied electrical engineering

2289
01:43:01,480 --> 01:43:02,760
and also chemical engineering,

2290
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:04,920
the masters in chemical engineering.

2291
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:08,680
What I think, I discovered

2292
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:10,640
because I switched to chemical engineering,

2293
01:43:10,640 --> 01:43:14,680
I found our whole host of what you would call design motifs.

2294
01:43:14,680 --> 01:43:16,280
And I also call it design motifs.

2295
01:43:16,280 --> 01:43:18,920
I mean, you're familiar with, say, a transistor,

2296
01:43:18,920 --> 01:43:20,360
but as an electrical engineer,

2297
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:23,040
you are not normally familiar

2298
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:26,040
with a stranger tractor inside the embryo.

2299
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:28,720
You're not familiar with the reaction diffusion equation

2300
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:31,040
which determines that shape.

2301
01:43:31,040 --> 01:43:34,080
You're not familiar with the sort of other fields

2302
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:36,480
which have different engineering motifs,

2303
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:37,800
different designs.

2304
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:40,640
What Dr. Levine did,

2305
01:43:40,640 --> 01:43:43,280
I think what you have to think about it in this way,

2306
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:46,760
living organisms are not, they're very Catholic,

2307
01:43:46,760 --> 01:43:48,240
they use everything.

2308
01:43:48,240 --> 01:43:51,560
What he did, they combine electrical with chemical,

2309
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:55,600
with mechanical in a very unorthodox way.

2310
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:56,920
But what Dr. Levine did,

2311
01:43:56,920 --> 01:43:59,800
he took the electrical system by itself

2312
01:43:59,800 --> 01:44:02,200
and discovered that that's a control system,

2313
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:04,880
which is, I think, very, very, very impressive.

2314
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:07,640
The chemical system is still very complex

2315
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:11,400
and a lot of it does not have electrical analogs.

2316
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:12,840
There are things that happen in biology

2317
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:17,840
which just don't translate into electrical motifs,

2318
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:22,520
but at least the electrical control system

2319
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:25,520
is now in view, like he's manipulating it.

2320
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:28,960
He's not manipulating it with external fields,

2321
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:31,200
he's actually using chemistry to manipulate it,

2322
01:44:31,200 --> 01:44:32,680
but it's still, because you can measure it,

2323
01:44:32,680 --> 01:44:36,200
he's got a voltage-sensitive dye.

2324
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:38,240
So he's actually measuring the electrical fields

2325
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:39,520
and he can see, for example, like you said,

2326
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:41,160
he can see the face of the embryo

2327
01:44:41,160 --> 01:44:43,360
before the embryo forms the face.

2328
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:45,840
So I think there's a lot of stuff around there

2329
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:48,040
which is not electrical, it's very confusing sometimes.

2330
01:44:48,040 --> 01:44:50,840
I was like that, I still am a lot, a lot of times,

2331
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:53,960
but at least we've taken the electrical system out

2332
01:44:53,960 --> 01:44:56,120
and we found that it's a control system.

2333
01:44:56,120 --> 01:44:56,960
Thank you.

2334
01:44:56,960 --> 01:44:59,800
Yeah, well, I know what you're saying.

2335
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:02,000
It's enormously interesting

2336
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:05,200
and I just don't wanna oversimplify it.

2337
01:45:05,200 --> 01:45:07,000
I don't think we fully understand,

2338
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,640
and Michael would agree, and I talked to him before,

2339
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:14,320
he doesn't fully understand and he will not claim to.

2340
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:17,840
I mean, we're poking at things in the dark

2341
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:22,320
and try and learn as a black box what we're doing here.

2342
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:24,840
And I would also not, I mean,

2343
01:45:24,840 --> 01:45:29,040
I'm gonna paste a link here for a video on replication

2344
01:45:29,160 --> 01:45:30,640
and the whole thing that goes on.

2345
01:45:30,640 --> 01:45:33,800
It is completely mind-blowing too.

2346
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:38,440
And there's very complex, very long,

2347
01:45:38,440 --> 01:45:42,120
intelligent state machines and subroutines

2348
01:45:42,120 --> 01:45:43,520
that you will see there.

2349
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:46,320
And this is all new, a lot of it is new research.

2350
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:50,720
When I took biochemistry even three years ago,

2351
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:54,440
some of this stuff was not yet known, like histones.

2352
01:45:54,440 --> 01:45:57,200
I mean, a lot of it is recent.

2353
01:45:57,200 --> 01:45:58,680
And it's just mind-boggling.

2354
01:45:58,680 --> 01:46:01,600
And I just don't wanna say, well, this is hardware

2355
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:05,280
because it has intelligence of its own.

2356
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:10,040
And it is isolated to a cell, right?

2357
01:46:11,480 --> 01:46:14,160
So in a way, you could say there's a hierarchy

2358
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:17,200
in what Michael is thinking is that

2359
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:19,760
you can control not at the cell level,

2360
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:22,920
you don't wanna be controlling at the genetic level.

2361
01:46:22,920 --> 01:46:26,840
And there's something very powerful there.

2362
01:46:27,680 --> 01:46:32,680
But I just don't think we can oversimplify it that way.

2363
01:46:35,480 --> 01:46:38,160
Well, there's a lot to figure out,

2364
01:46:38,160 --> 01:46:39,920
we need more time to do it.

2365
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:42,840
Jeff?

2366
01:46:44,160 --> 01:46:49,160
Well, Dr. Levin seems to have really opened up

2367
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:52,400
a whole new field of endeavor,

2368
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:56,120
just scratching the surface.

2369
01:46:56,120 --> 01:46:58,680
You can look at all kinds of applications

2370
01:46:58,680 --> 01:47:02,520
to repair the damage of organs

2371
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:07,160
and systems that occur during aging.

2372
01:47:07,160 --> 01:47:11,160
But ultimately, it seems like that approaches,

2373
01:47:11,160 --> 01:47:13,480
becomes the game of whack-a-mole,

2374
01:47:13,480 --> 01:47:17,400
where as you age, more and more things go wrong

2375
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:20,160
and you can be repairing until that's all you're doing

2376
01:47:20,160 --> 01:47:22,120
is repairing this and that.

2377
01:47:22,120 --> 01:47:26,200
But because we are fundamentally programmed to age,

2378
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:29,760
but yet there might be an opportunity with this technology

2379
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:31,600
to change that program.

2380
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:33,920
We keep coming back to this computer analogy,

2381
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:36,960
but I think it is a good analogy

2382
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:40,320
that this technology could possibly

2383
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:43,200
just change the entire program where we do not,

2384
01:47:43,200 --> 01:47:46,400
you change the software so we do not age.

2385
01:47:52,760 --> 01:47:56,560
Well, let's work on it, let's do it.

2386
01:47:56,560 --> 01:47:59,240
That's the moonshot, as you would say.

2387
01:47:59,240 --> 01:48:02,480
Well, yeah, I think.

2388
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:05,280
Yeah, I've got something to talk about.

2389
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:06,880
You'll hear about it in a later meeting,

2390
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:11,320
but let's see, Miles, you had another question.

2391
01:48:11,320 --> 01:48:13,880
Yeah, no, no, no, I just wanted to say,

2392
01:48:13,880 --> 01:48:15,520
yes, I agree with Jeff,

2393
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:17,480
but I do believe in this combinational,

2394
01:48:17,480 --> 01:48:20,120
they're gonna search for the right combination.

2395
01:48:20,120 --> 01:48:22,080
And you're gonna see the same radical change

2396
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:24,080
that you saw with the Amunaka factors,

2397
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:26,280
which is completely unnatural.

2398
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:27,960
So I expect that, Jeff.

2399
01:48:29,480 --> 01:48:32,200
The other question I want to make is just

2400
01:48:32,200 --> 01:48:33,640
that he's not alone anymore.

2401
01:48:33,640 --> 01:48:35,880
There's a big program at Harvard University.

2402
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:37,640
You know, the nuclear program,

2403
01:48:37,640 --> 01:48:41,800
the venture capitalist are doing a big program

2404
01:48:41,800 --> 01:48:45,680
on bioelectricity, on bioelectric control,

2405
01:48:45,680 --> 01:48:47,840
as a response to his discovery.

2406
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:51,240
So it's not as isolated as what we think.

2407
01:48:51,240 --> 01:48:54,880
There's actually money now going into this technology

2408
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:56,840
as we speak.

2409
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:02,200
Yeah, I was just gonna comment.

2410
01:49:02,200 --> 01:49:03,560
I agree with what you said, Miles.

2411
01:49:03,560 --> 01:49:06,280
It's a broad area of research

2412
01:49:06,280 --> 01:49:09,120
and commenting on your comment too, Jeff.

2413
01:49:09,120 --> 01:49:14,120
I think you're thinking about it sort of the right way

2414
01:49:14,160 --> 01:49:15,760
to some degree,

2415
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:18,240
but with a slightly different flavor.

2416
01:49:18,240 --> 01:49:20,560
So it's not that we wouldn't age at all.

2417
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:23,560
It's just we would have various tools

2418
01:49:23,560 --> 01:49:28,400
to enhance our resilience to effectively slow down

2419
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:31,840
the aging process very dramatically,

2420
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:36,840
while also augmenting ourselves to be much more resilient.

2421
01:49:36,920 --> 01:49:40,880
And then in turn, actually reversing damage.

2422
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:42,360
Like it's slightly different.

2423
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:45,080
Like you think about like the sense, you know,

2424
01:49:45,080 --> 01:49:47,880
Aubury degree, they always talk about like this damage,

2425
01:49:47,880 --> 01:49:51,840
but it's really like the repair mechanisms

2426
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:53,520
that are not functioning correctly

2427
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:56,960
or like the rejuvenation functions

2428
01:49:56,960 --> 01:49:58,480
that aren't resilient enough.

2429
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:02,560
So I think we can augment those through these tools

2430
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:04,760
would be kind of the way I was thinking of it.

2431
01:50:04,760 --> 01:50:07,840
And another short comment, you know,

2432
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:09,240
I was thinking about what Fiona was saying

2433
01:50:09,240 --> 01:50:12,280
and I looked at that video and I tend to agree

2434
01:50:12,280 --> 01:50:15,520
there's so much complexity in the body.

2435
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:19,200
But I think using like approach that Dr. Levin's using

2436
01:50:19,200 --> 01:50:21,040
sort of like a top down, you know,

2437
01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:24,840
if we can target specific organs and we can see,

2438
01:50:24,840 --> 01:50:27,560
I mean, the way he targeted like an arm to regrow

2439
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:29,960
in some of these sample organisms, you know,

2440
01:50:29,960 --> 01:50:33,760
we may not understand some of the underlying biology

2441
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:36,080
on the cellular level or even in the cells

2442
01:50:36,080 --> 01:50:38,440
and maybe still remain a mystery

2443
01:50:38,440 --> 01:50:41,140
even after we can rejuvenate entire organs.

2444
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:44,520
You know, so I don't think we'll have to understand

2445
01:50:44,520 --> 01:50:46,560
like every single component

2446
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:49,120
or even like the complete map I was describing,

2447
01:50:49,120 --> 01:50:52,160
I don't think we would have, at least not for a long time,

2448
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:54,200
you know, okay, you have this frequency

2449
01:50:54,200 --> 01:50:55,720
or this electrical signal,

2450
01:50:55,720 --> 01:50:57,960
what does it do to each individual cell type?

2451
01:50:57,960 --> 01:51:00,520
Which, you know, we have thousands of cell types.

2452
01:51:00,520 --> 01:51:03,520
So that would be a much harder problem too.

2453
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:04,520
Just a few thoughts.

2454
01:51:04,520 --> 01:51:09,520
We don't have to understand everything to work with it.

2455
01:51:14,600 --> 01:51:18,560
It's like we may not understand how we breathe completely,

2456
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:20,600
but we breathe and we function.

2457
01:51:20,600 --> 01:51:24,480
So in that way, I'm a complete supporter of,

2458
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:27,560
let's use that tool and all the other tools.

2459
01:51:29,560 --> 01:51:32,320
I agree, yeah, we have to understand it enough

2460
01:51:33,160 --> 01:51:36,640
to like alter it, for sure, I definitely agree.

2461
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:38,840
I'll take it.

2462
01:51:38,840 --> 01:51:42,000
If there is a way you could, even if you don't understand,

2463
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:46,320
you could do a pattern, a bioelectric pattern

2464
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:49,720
and tell the body to go backwards and rejuvenate,

2465
01:51:49,720 --> 01:51:51,840
that's cool, right?

2466
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:54,680
It's a little bit of a, well,

2467
01:51:55,960 --> 01:51:59,200
we can certainly keep learning that dimension.

2468
01:51:59,200 --> 01:52:01,800
Yeah, it's a star shot for sure, as Johnny would say.

2469
01:52:03,320 --> 01:52:04,160
Thank you.

2470
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:11,760
Well, it's been a couple of hours.

2471
01:52:12,680 --> 01:52:16,280
This has been most rewarding.

2472
01:52:16,280 --> 01:52:18,480
As quickly as possible,

2473
01:52:18,480 --> 01:52:21,320
I'll get the recording up on the YouTube channel.

2474
01:52:21,320 --> 01:52:25,040
I don't know about you, but I'm gonna watch it a number

2475
01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:27,760
of times for all this to really sink in

2476
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:30,360
and then take it to the next level.

2477
01:52:30,360 --> 01:52:32,680
How will we use this to solve aging?

2478
01:52:32,680 --> 01:52:35,160
And then, oh, little questions like,

2479
01:52:35,160 --> 01:52:40,000
how will we raise the money to use this to save aging?

2480
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:43,480
And I have something I'm gonna reveal soon.

2481
01:52:43,480 --> 01:52:46,680
You will probably be among the first to see it.

2482
01:52:47,640 --> 01:52:52,640
So if you are going to the foresight frontiers

2483
01:52:54,120 --> 01:52:56,880
in longevity science, I think that's the name

2484
01:52:56,880 --> 01:52:59,280
of the conference in San Francisco.

2485
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:04,840
I know, I believe Fiona, you'll be there.

2486
01:53:04,840 --> 01:53:08,480
It's April 17th and 18th.

2487
01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:13,480
You can't really get in now unless you become a sponsor,

2488
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:17,520
but yeah, that's gonna be world-class.

2489
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:19,520
So I'll look forward to seeing you there.

2490
01:53:22,240 --> 01:53:26,040
So unless there's any final, Jeff, final comments?

2491
01:53:27,880 --> 01:53:31,040
If people are interested in learning more

2492
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:36,040
about Dr. Levin's work, of course, reading all of his papers,

2493
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:40,840
but there are a number of much longer interviews on YouTube

2494
01:53:40,840 --> 01:53:43,840
than he, and he doesn't just give the same canned speech

2495
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:45,040
over and over again.

2496
01:53:45,040 --> 01:53:48,080
He covers a lot of different ground

2497
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:51,000
in his interviews that he gives.

2498
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:54,760
So there's some other good videos to watch

2499
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:56,680
if you want to see more of him.

2500
01:53:58,640 --> 01:54:00,240
You can search for him on YouTube.

2501
01:54:02,200 --> 01:54:05,040
So this was an outstanding thank you, Johnny,

2502
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:06,480
for organizing this conference.

2503
01:54:06,480 --> 01:54:07,800
No, no, no, Miles.

2504
01:54:07,800 --> 01:54:09,120
It was fascinating.

2505
01:54:09,120 --> 01:54:11,240
I mean, I was at the edge of my seat.

2506
01:54:11,240 --> 01:54:12,520
Miles, thank you.

2507
01:54:12,520 --> 01:54:13,360
Thanks, Miles.

2508
01:54:13,360 --> 01:54:14,200
Very good.

2509
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:16,440
Thank you, everyone.

2510
01:54:16,440 --> 01:54:17,280
Appreciate it, Miles.

2511
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:18,120
Thanks, people.

2512
01:54:18,120 --> 01:54:19,720
Sorry for the date.

2513
01:54:19,720 --> 01:54:22,200
He's not available on Saturdays.

2514
01:54:23,200 --> 01:54:26,000
Me and Johnny had a lot of back and forth

2515
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,560
trying to get him on a Saturday, but me.

2516
01:54:29,560 --> 01:54:30,400
It's so hard.

2517
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:31,240
It's so hard.

2518
01:54:31,240 --> 01:54:33,120
It's breaking the schedule for that.

2519
01:54:33,120 --> 01:54:33,960
Sure, yeah.

2520
01:54:33,960 --> 01:54:34,800
Thank you very much.

2521
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:35,640
Thank you very much.

2522
01:54:35,640 --> 01:54:36,480
Much worth it.

2523
01:54:37,560 --> 01:54:38,960
Okay, thanks, everyone.

2524
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:41,160
This has been a great morning.

2525
01:54:41,160 --> 01:54:44,240
We're all off to a great Friday and a great weekend.

2526
01:54:44,240 --> 01:54:45,400
So thank you.

2527
01:54:45,400 --> 01:54:46,680
See you next time.
