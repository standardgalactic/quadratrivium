00:00.000 --> 00:04.240
Welcome to our gerontology research group online meeting.

00:04.240 --> 00:08.360
Today is Friday, March 24th, 2023.

00:08.360 --> 00:11.640
And special thanks to Miles Jacobs,

00:11.640 --> 00:13.880
who manages our meetings.

00:13.880 --> 00:16.360
I'm kind of busy solving the problems

00:16.360 --> 00:19.040
of biological aging these days.

00:19.040 --> 00:20.960
And without Miles,

00:20.960 --> 00:23.900
we probably wouldn't have as many of these meetings

00:23.900 --> 00:27.680
and they definitely would not be as high quality

00:27.720 --> 00:29.520
as the one we're gonna have today.

00:30.680 --> 00:35.040
Today we have an extraordinary innovative speaker,

00:35.040 --> 00:36.920
Dr. Michael Levin.

00:36.920 --> 00:40.360
And Dr. Levin is distinguished professor

00:40.360 --> 00:42.480
and Vannevar Bush chair,

00:42.480 --> 00:44.920
biology department at Tufts,

00:44.920 --> 00:49.520
and director of the Allen Discovery Center at Tufts.

00:49.520 --> 00:54.520
He's also associate faculty at Harvard's Dease Institute.

00:54.520 --> 00:59.520
In his lab, he studies basic questions of information

01:00.320 --> 01:02.520
processing and biology,

01:02.520 --> 01:06.640
and drives applications in regenerative medicine

01:06.640 --> 01:09.600
and synthetic bioengineering.

01:12.320 --> 01:13.720
It must have been 20 years ago,

01:13.720 --> 01:17.240
I read a book, The Body Electric by Becker,

01:17.240 --> 01:20.160
and I was just amazed at the opportunity.

01:20.160 --> 01:23.760
And now I believe Dr. Levin

01:23.760 --> 01:26.640
is going to bring some of that to life for you.

01:26.640 --> 01:30.880
So I will hand the floor over to Dr. Michael Levin.

01:33.240 --> 01:35.000
Well, thank you so much for the invitation

01:35.000 --> 01:37.720
and thank you for the opportunity to talk to you all

01:37.720 --> 01:38.920
and share some ideas.

01:38.920 --> 01:42.640
I am not directly working in the field of aging,

01:42.640 --> 01:45.160
but I think we have some thoughts

01:45.160 --> 01:48.440
that are possibly useful for that set of questions.

01:48.440 --> 01:50.240
And so if anybody's interested,

01:50.240 --> 01:53.040
this is the website where you can find all the primary papers,

01:53.040 --> 01:56.320
the software, the data sets, and everything else.

01:56.320 --> 01:58.000
So I'm going to talk about today

01:58.000 --> 02:00.360
is an approach towards what I call

02:00.360 --> 02:02.200
a definitive regenerative medicine.

02:02.200 --> 02:03.680
I will explain what I mean.

02:03.680 --> 02:06.120
And in my view,

02:06.120 --> 02:09.560
the road to this definitive regenerative medicine

02:09.560 --> 02:12.480
contains large components of understanding

02:12.480 --> 02:15.280
natural bioelectrical signaling between cells,

02:15.280 --> 02:17.600
specifically not just as a physical mechanism,

02:17.600 --> 02:19.440
but actually as the medium

02:19.440 --> 02:22.640
for the collective intelligence of groups of cells.

02:22.640 --> 02:25.520
So what I mean by a definitive regenerative medicine

02:25.520 --> 02:30.040
is breaking the unsustainable feedback loop

02:30.040 --> 02:33.920
or cycle between this scheme

02:33.920 --> 02:37.840
where we try these interventions late in life.

02:37.840 --> 02:42.840
And to whatever extent we can push forward the lifespan,

02:43.520 --> 02:44.880
the next set of interventions

02:44.880 --> 02:46.480
has to be increasingly more heroic

02:46.480 --> 02:48.040
because what you're basically dealing with

02:48.040 --> 02:50.640
is a continuously sinking ship.

02:50.640 --> 02:54.960
And this is unacceptable for us as patients.

02:54.960 --> 02:57.040
It's unsupportable for any society

02:57.040 --> 02:59.600
because it exponentially increases the cost

02:59.600 --> 03:02.320
of each further intervention that has to be done.

03:02.320 --> 03:05.240
So something radical has to break this cycle.

03:05.240 --> 03:07.440
And if we think about it,

03:07.440 --> 03:09.600
all of the problems of medicine

03:09.600 --> 03:11.680
with the exception of infectious disease.

03:11.680 --> 03:14.160
So we're talking about birth defects, traumatic injuries,

03:14.160 --> 03:16.920
cancer, aging, degenerative disease, all of this

03:16.920 --> 03:18.920
have one important thing in common.

03:18.920 --> 03:22.200
They are all problems of information processing

03:22.200 --> 03:23.560
in the following sense.

03:23.560 --> 03:28.040
If we could control what it is that groups of cells build,

03:28.040 --> 03:29.880
that is if we could convince groups of cells

03:29.880 --> 03:32.800
to build particular complex anatomical structures,

03:32.800 --> 03:34.400
all of these problems would go away.

03:34.400 --> 03:37.680
We could continuously rebuild structures of the body

03:37.680 --> 03:40.840
to maintain health span, repair injuries,

03:40.840 --> 03:42.440
reprogram cancer.

03:42.440 --> 03:45.880
All of these things would be resolved

03:45.880 --> 03:48.240
if we understood how to get cells

03:48.240 --> 03:50.960
to build particular anatomical structures.

03:50.960 --> 03:55.960
And so the kind of end game of this whole field,

03:56.480 --> 03:59.960
I call something that can be termed

03:59.960 --> 04:01.920
as the anatomical compiler.

04:01.920 --> 04:04.160
The idea is that someday in the future,

04:04.160 --> 04:06.120
we will be able to sit down in front of a computer

04:06.120 --> 04:10.440
and draw in terms of the anatomy that you want

04:10.440 --> 04:12.080
your plant or animal to have.

04:12.080 --> 04:13.840
So not molecular pathways,

04:13.840 --> 04:16.480
not the underlying biochemical details,

04:16.480 --> 04:17.680
but what you actually care about,

04:17.680 --> 04:20.040
which is the form and function.

04:20.040 --> 04:22.760
So you will draw this some sort of anatomical structure

04:22.760 --> 04:24.560
like this three-headed flatworm.

04:24.560 --> 04:26.440
And if we knew what we were doing,

04:26.440 --> 04:28.960
the anatomical compiler would convert

04:28.960 --> 04:32.320
that anatomical descriptor into a set of stimuli

04:32.320 --> 04:34.760
that would get cells to build exactly that.

04:34.760 --> 04:35.600
So what we're talking about

04:35.600 --> 04:37.600
is complete control over growth and form.

04:37.600 --> 04:40.480
This is the radical solution that we need.

04:40.480 --> 04:44.440
Now note that this kind of thing is not a 3D printer.

04:44.440 --> 04:47.160
The point is not to micromanage

04:47.160 --> 04:48.760
where every single cell goes.

04:48.760 --> 04:50.160
It's a communications device.

04:50.160 --> 04:51.800
And we'll get back to this concept

04:51.800 --> 04:53.760
towards the end of the talk.

04:53.760 --> 04:58.160
So having focused in on this idea

04:58.160 --> 05:03.160
that it is the cooperative action of collectives of cells

05:03.920 --> 05:05.240
that build our various organs,

05:05.240 --> 05:07.120
either healthy organs or not,

05:07.120 --> 05:09.200
we can then ask this very simple question.

05:09.200 --> 05:12.520
Where does the body anatomy come from in the first place?

05:12.520 --> 05:14.560
So this is a cross-section of a human torso.

05:14.560 --> 05:18.600
You see all the amazing structures that are here, right?

05:18.600 --> 05:21.400
Everything is the correct size, shape relative to

05:21.400 --> 05:25.160
the things next to it and the correct orientation.

05:25.160 --> 05:27.600
So where is this structure set?

05:27.600 --> 05:29.880
Where is this order specified?

05:29.880 --> 05:34.160
And lots of people are kind of intuitively will say,

05:34.160 --> 05:36.600
well, it's the genome, it's in the DNA.

05:36.600 --> 05:38.320
But if we look closer at that claim,

05:38.600 --> 05:40.640
we now understand we can sequence genomes.

05:40.640 --> 05:41.680
Now we know what's in the DNA.

05:41.680 --> 05:43.440
The DNA doesn't say anything directly

05:43.440 --> 05:45.360
about large-scale anatomical parameters.

05:45.360 --> 05:47.720
What the DNA specifies is proteins.

05:47.720 --> 05:50.680
It specifies the micro-level hardware

05:50.680 --> 05:52.920
that each individual cell gets to have.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.520
And so what we still need to understand

05:54.520 --> 05:59.040
is how the actual collective activity of these cells

05:59.040 --> 06:02.120
with the hardware that they have from their genome

06:02.120 --> 06:04.760
works together to build the right thing.

06:04.760 --> 06:07.120
That is a species-specific target morphology.

06:07.120 --> 06:09.600
How do these cells know when to stop?

06:09.600 --> 06:12.000
Why do cells sometimes defect from this plan

06:12.000 --> 06:13.320
and form cancer?

06:13.320 --> 06:15.800
We'll talk a little bit about that.

06:15.800 --> 06:18.320
How would we induce, if a part of this is missing or damaged,

06:18.320 --> 06:20.840
how would we induce these cells to rebuild,

06:20.840 --> 06:22.320
damage their aging structures?

06:22.320 --> 06:25.320
And as engineers, how far can we push this process?

06:25.320 --> 06:26.720
What else can these cells build

06:26.720 --> 06:29.720
besides their normal default target morphology?

06:29.720 --> 06:33.480
And so I want to kind of start off by thinking about

06:33.480 --> 06:37.520
what's necessary to understand this process.

06:37.520 --> 06:40.120
And we've had great advances in genomics

06:40.120 --> 06:43.200
and molecular biology and big data and genetics and so on.

06:43.200 --> 06:44.720
And so you might think that,

06:44.720 --> 06:46.240
well, this should be solved already.

06:46.240 --> 06:49.520
Why do we not have this anatomical compiler?

06:49.520 --> 06:51.160
And I just want to be very clear

06:51.160 --> 06:55.640
that very, very fundamental things are still impossible

06:55.640 --> 06:58.920
from the perspective of genetics and molecular biology.

06:58.920 --> 07:00.400
So this is just one example.

07:00.400 --> 07:02.000
So here's a baby axolotl.

07:02.040 --> 07:03.960
It's a little salamander.

07:03.960 --> 07:05.760
Baby axolotls have four legs.

07:05.760 --> 07:08.960
This is a frog larva or a tadpole,

07:08.960 --> 07:10.840
which do not have legs.

07:10.840 --> 07:13.560
And in my lab, what we can do is we can make frog allotls,

07:13.560 --> 07:15.680
which is an embryo that's part salamander cells,

07:15.680 --> 07:16.840
part frog cells.

07:16.840 --> 07:19.760
Now, I pose a simple question.

07:20.680 --> 07:23.200
Will frog allotls have legs or won't they?

07:23.200 --> 07:25.240
Now, we've got the genome for the axolotl.

07:25.240 --> 07:26.080
It's been sequenced.

07:26.080 --> 07:27.280
We've got the genome for the frog.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.840
It's been sequenced.

07:28.840 --> 07:30.720
Can anybody tell me whether frog allotls

07:30.720 --> 07:32.080
are going to have legs or not?

07:32.080 --> 07:32.920
And the answer is no.

07:32.920 --> 07:36.560
We have no idea or even more subtle questions like,

07:36.560 --> 07:37.400
if they do have legs,

07:37.400 --> 07:40.040
are they going to be made entirely of the axolotl cells

07:40.040 --> 07:42.240
or are they in fact going to induce

07:42.240 --> 07:44.000
some of the frog cells to participate?

07:44.000 --> 07:46.480
And that's because this kind of question

07:46.480 --> 07:47.920
is not a question that could be answered

07:47.920 --> 07:48.960
at the level of the hardware.

07:48.960 --> 07:51.200
This is a collective intelligence question.

07:51.200 --> 07:54.800
What are these complex agents going to build?

07:54.800 --> 07:56.800
And we are still not very good at understanding

07:56.800 --> 07:58.880
the rules of that kind of process.

07:58.880 --> 08:02.920
So where we are really is that molecular medicine

08:02.920 --> 08:05.200
is very good at understanding

08:05.200 --> 08:06.800
which genes and proteins interact

08:06.800 --> 08:08.200
with which other genes and proteins.

08:08.200 --> 08:10.680
And so we can build nice models like this.

08:10.680 --> 08:12.680
But we are really quite a long way away

08:12.680 --> 08:15.360
from the control of large scale structure and function.

08:15.360 --> 08:18.120
If you wanted to make rational changes at the system level,

08:18.120 --> 08:21.120
it is very hard to know what to do back here.

08:21.120 --> 08:24.720
And so I think where molecular medicine is today

08:24.720 --> 08:28.480
is roughly where computer science was in the 40s and 50s.

08:29.480 --> 08:31.160
If you wanted to program a computer,

08:31.160 --> 08:33.040
you had to interact with the hardware.

08:33.040 --> 08:35.000
You had to directly rewire it physically.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.960
You were always down at that hardware level.

08:37.960 --> 08:39.520
And this is where we are today.

08:39.520 --> 08:44.520
So all of the most exciting parts of molecular medicine,

08:44.880 --> 08:48.240
so genome editing, CRISPR, protein engineering,

08:48.240 --> 08:50.200
pathway rewiring, all of these things

08:50.200 --> 08:52.760
are really down at the biological hardware level.

08:52.760 --> 08:55.320
We haven't even really begun to take advantage

08:55.320 --> 08:58.840
of what computer science has done

08:58.840 --> 09:01.760
to give us the information technology revolution,

09:01.760 --> 09:04.040
which is to figure out that actually,

09:04.040 --> 09:05.520
if your hardware is good enough,

09:05.520 --> 09:07.280
and I'm going to argue that biological hardware

09:07.280 --> 09:08.640
is definitely good enough,

09:08.640 --> 09:11.520
then what you can do is you can communicate with it

09:11.520 --> 09:13.560
via a high level interface.

09:13.560 --> 09:16.080
You don't have to, this is the reason why

09:16.080 --> 09:18.880
when you want to change from PowerPoint

09:18.880 --> 09:20.440
to Zoom on your laptop,

09:20.440 --> 09:22.760
you don't get out your soldering iron and start rewiring.

09:22.760 --> 09:24.960
It's because we have this nice interface

09:25.000 --> 09:28.520
that allows you access to some of the computational capacities

09:28.520 --> 09:30.520
of the system that are reprogrammable.

09:30.520 --> 09:34.200
In other words, could we take advantage

09:34.200 --> 09:38.280
of a higher level of information processing specifically,

09:38.280 --> 09:40.160
and I'm going to define this word in a minute,

09:40.160 --> 09:43.520
specifically the intelligence of the software of life.

09:43.520 --> 09:44.720
And the thing about biology,

09:44.720 --> 09:46.560
which is actually not captured today

09:46.560 --> 09:48.760
in any of our computational devices

09:48.760 --> 09:50.720
or robotics or anything like that,

09:50.720 --> 09:54.400
is this amazing multi-scale competency architecture

09:54.400 --> 09:56.840
where we're not just a nested doll,

09:56.840 --> 09:58.440
set of nested dolls structurally,

09:58.440 --> 10:00.920
where you've got molecular networks and cells

10:00.920 --> 10:03.320
and tissues and organs and swarms and so on.

10:03.320 --> 10:06.120
But actually, each one of these layers has competencies

10:06.120 --> 10:09.120
that solve specific problems in its own space.

10:09.120 --> 10:11.840
So we have a problem solving in physiological space,

10:11.840 --> 10:13.120
in transcriptional space,

10:13.120 --> 10:14.840
meaning the space of gene expression,

10:14.840 --> 10:17.120
in anatomical morphous space,

10:17.120 --> 10:19.440
and of course, in familiar 3D behavioral space

10:19.440 --> 10:21.320
in the case of whole organisms.

10:22.240 --> 10:24.840
And so we could spend hours talking

10:24.840 --> 10:26.520
about all these different examples,

10:26.520 --> 10:28.080
but I just want to highlight a couple of things

10:28.080 --> 10:29.560
and then spend most of my time

10:29.560 --> 10:32.920
talking about the morphogenetic problem solving.

10:32.920 --> 10:34.800
So just to give you an example

10:34.800 --> 10:37.600
of some of the amazing plasticity of life,

10:37.600 --> 10:39.360
this is what we've done here is we've made a tadpole.

10:39.360 --> 10:41.320
So here's the mouth, here are the nostrils,

10:41.320 --> 10:42.920
the brain, the gut, the tail,

10:42.920 --> 10:44.640
in which you'll notice something very strange

10:44.640 --> 10:45.480
about this tadpole.

10:45.480 --> 10:47.680
There aren't any eyes where the eye should be.

10:47.680 --> 10:50.440
What we've done is we've placed some eye cells on its tail.

10:50.440 --> 10:54.720
Now these cells, they have no problem forming a perfect eye,

10:54.720 --> 10:56.080
even though they're sitting next to muscle

10:56.080 --> 10:57.440
instead of next to the brain.

10:57.440 --> 11:00.120
They then put out a single optic nerve, which crawls out.

11:00.120 --> 11:02.800
It synapses on the spinal cord right here, then it stops,

11:02.800 --> 11:03.960
it does not go to the brain,

11:03.960 --> 11:06.400
it sort of ends on the spinal cord.

11:06.400 --> 11:08.880
And these animals, as we found from building a machine

11:08.880 --> 11:11.800
that automates the training and testing

11:11.800 --> 11:13.760
of these guys on visual cues,

11:13.760 --> 11:15.200
these animals can see quite well.

11:15.200 --> 11:17.360
They see perfectly well out of this eye.

11:17.360 --> 11:19.320
And so what you see here is this amazing plasticity

11:19.320 --> 11:21.680
where this brain that expected visual input

11:21.680 --> 11:23.880
from these two locations for millions of years,

11:23.880 --> 11:25.320
this is the architecture.

11:25.320 --> 11:28.480
In one generation, no adaptation,

11:28.480 --> 11:30.520
specific adaptation needed,

11:30.520 --> 11:33.360
the fact that the sensory motor architecture

11:33.360 --> 11:35.000
is now completely different, no problem.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.720
They're able to incorporate that

11:36.720 --> 11:38.600
into their behavioral repertoire.

11:38.600 --> 11:43.600
So it's clear that there are these interesting capabilities

11:45.960 --> 11:49.280
of these kinds of biological systems to adapt to novel.

11:49.320 --> 11:51.480
Circumstances, and this is what we're going to hijack.

11:51.480 --> 11:53.640
These are the kinds of things we're going to hijack

11:53.640 --> 11:58.440
for a kind of a really, really radical regenerative medicine.

11:58.440 --> 12:00.520
What I wanna spend some time on now

12:00.520 --> 12:04.080
is to introduce you to this little critter,

12:04.080 --> 12:05.520
which I think in many ways,

12:05.520 --> 12:07.200
this model system has the answer

12:07.200 --> 12:09.320
to many of the big questions of life,

12:09.320 --> 12:10.880
not only medicine, but beyond.

12:10.880 --> 12:12.800
This is a planarian flatworm.

12:12.800 --> 12:15.560
So these are not simple organisms like earthworms.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.840
These are similar to our direct ancestor.

12:17.840 --> 12:19.600
They have true bilateral symmetry.

12:19.600 --> 12:21.400
They have a true centralized brain.

12:21.400 --> 12:23.520
They have lots of organs, lots of different cell types,

12:23.520 --> 12:26.320
all the same neurotransmitters that you and I have.

12:26.320 --> 12:28.480
And they have a number of amazing properties.

12:28.480 --> 12:30.680
The first is regeneration.

12:30.680 --> 12:32.400
So you can cut them into pieces.

12:32.400 --> 12:35.640
The record is something like 275 pieces.

12:35.640 --> 12:36.920
It doesn't matter how you cut them,

12:36.920 --> 12:37.920
what the plane of section is,

12:37.920 --> 12:39.360
you can cut them any way you want.

12:39.360 --> 12:41.360
Each piece regenerates a perfect worm.

12:41.360 --> 12:42.760
It grows exactly what's needed,

12:42.760 --> 12:46.640
no more or less gives you a perfect, perfect worm.

12:46.640 --> 12:48.080
They're very cancer resistant.

12:48.080 --> 12:49.320
It's not that they can't get cancer,

12:49.320 --> 12:53.040
but they're extremely resistant and they're immortal.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.280
This is maybe the part

12:54.280 --> 12:56.320
that's the most interesting to all of you.

12:56.320 --> 12:58.760
There is no such thing as an old planarian.

12:58.760 --> 13:01.120
The individual cells senesce and drop off,

13:01.120 --> 13:02.360
but they get regenerated.

13:02.360 --> 13:06.360
This animal regenerates continuously.

13:06.360 --> 13:10.640
And so the animals that are in my lab now

13:10.640 --> 13:13.440
are in direct physical continuity to worms

13:13.440 --> 13:15.160
that were here half a billion years ago.

13:15.160 --> 13:16.960
These are literally them.

13:16.960 --> 13:19.120
They just sort of continue.

13:19.120 --> 13:20.680
And they're smart.

13:20.680 --> 13:21.520
You can train them.

13:21.520 --> 13:23.040
I'll talk about that momentarily.

13:23.040 --> 13:24.840
And they've got this interesting property.

13:24.840 --> 13:28.400
So they've got an incredibly messy genome.

13:28.400 --> 13:29.240
Why?

13:29.240 --> 13:31.440
Because most of us reproduce sexually,

13:31.440 --> 13:33.240
which means that when you reproduce,

13:33.240 --> 13:35.920
your children do not inherit the somatic mutations

13:35.920 --> 13:38.400
that happened in your body during your lifetime.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.680
But in planaria, the way they typically reproduce

13:40.680 --> 13:43.280
is they tear themselves in half and then regenerate.

13:43.280 --> 13:46.160
So any mutation that doesn't kill the stem cell

13:46.160 --> 13:49.000
in which it occurs basically gets propagated

13:49.000 --> 13:51.120
through the body in the subsequent generation.

13:51.120 --> 13:53.480
They hold on to, this is called somatic inheritance.

13:53.480 --> 13:55.240
They've hold on to all of these mutations.

13:55.240 --> 13:59.400
They don't clean them up the way that the rest of us do.

13:59.400 --> 14:02.040
And so their genome is a complete mess.

14:02.040 --> 14:03.960
They can be mix-a-ploid, meaning every cell

14:03.960 --> 14:05.760
has a different number of chromosomes.

14:06.640 --> 14:10.720
They look, it actually looks a lot like what we would say

14:10.720 --> 14:11.880
of a tumor genome.

14:11.920 --> 14:15.920
And yet it has all of these properties.

14:15.920 --> 14:18.400
Now, this is really strange.

14:18.400 --> 14:21.920
In no course of cell developmental biology,

14:21.920 --> 14:25.200
genetics and so on, does anybody give you a theory

14:25.200 --> 14:27.960
that would predict why the animal with the messiest genome

14:27.960 --> 14:29.840
would actually be the most regenerative,

14:29.840 --> 14:32.160
cancer-resistant and immortal?

14:32.160 --> 14:37.160
Because what we're told instead is that the genome

14:37.280 --> 14:40.880
and your genotype is actually a critical determinant

14:40.880 --> 14:42.080
of all your capacities.

14:42.080 --> 14:43.400
This goes exactly backwards.

14:43.400 --> 14:45.240
Why would the animal with the worst genome

14:45.240 --> 14:47.240
have all these amazing properties?

14:47.240 --> 14:49.240
Now, they have one more interesting property

14:49.240 --> 14:52.920
which is interesting for aging, which is this.

14:52.920 --> 14:54.200
They're smart, you can train them.

14:54.200 --> 14:58.000
And so if you make little bumps like this

14:58.000 --> 15:00.360
on the laser edge, little bumps on the surface

15:00.360 --> 15:02.680
and you feed them with liver on this region.

15:02.680 --> 15:05.000
And so they remember that this is sort of a safe place

15:05.000 --> 15:06.200
where they can eat.

15:06.200 --> 15:08.080
Then you can cut off their heads

15:08.080 --> 15:10.320
and the tail will sit there for a week and a half

15:10.320 --> 15:11.480
doing nothing.

15:11.480 --> 15:14.200
They will then regenerate eventually a brain,

15:14.200 --> 15:15.440
the head with the entire brain.

15:15.440 --> 15:17.080
And then you will find out that these animals

15:17.080 --> 15:19.120
still remember the original training.

15:19.120 --> 15:20.520
So what you see in this model system,

15:20.520 --> 15:23.560
you can actually look at the distribution of memory

15:23.560 --> 15:25.920
in the rest of the body, meaning outside the brain.

15:25.920 --> 15:28.680
And most importantly, the imprinting of that information

15:28.680 --> 15:31.160
onto a new brain as it develops.

15:31.160 --> 15:35.360
Besides kind of a fundamental philosophical implications,

15:35.360 --> 15:40.080
what the medical kind of impact of this

15:40.120 --> 15:43.400
is that in the future, when we have regenerative therapies

15:43.400 --> 15:47.360
that replace cells in a human patient's brain,

15:47.360 --> 15:50.760
which may have six or seven decades of memories

15:50.760 --> 15:54.560
and personality and so on with progeny of naive new cells,

15:54.560 --> 15:56.440
the question is what happens to the personality

15:56.440 --> 15:57.280
of that patient?

15:57.280 --> 16:00.520
And these kind of models start to suggest

16:00.520 --> 16:03.600
that actually there may be considerable hope

16:03.600 --> 16:07.880
that these properties are actually spread farther

16:07.880 --> 16:10.120
than one thinks and may actually be imprinted

16:10.120 --> 16:11.520
onto the new tissue.

16:11.520 --> 16:13.880
So let's think about how all this amazing plasticity works,

16:13.880 --> 16:16.440
regeneration of body and of memories.

16:16.440 --> 16:17.560
How does it work?

16:17.560 --> 16:21.080
Well, the key is this, that all of us

16:21.080 --> 16:22.560
used to be individual cells.

16:22.560 --> 16:25.600
We all started life as an unfertilized oocyte,

16:25.600 --> 16:30.040
a quiescent oocyte that's a little pile of biochemistry.

16:30.040 --> 16:31.880
And through this process of development,

16:31.880 --> 16:33.760
you become one of these creatures

16:33.760 --> 16:36.280
or perhaps one like this.

16:36.360 --> 16:38.640
This is Renee Descartes,

16:38.640 --> 16:40.680
who is going to have all kinds of opinions

16:40.680 --> 16:44.640
about the living beings and machines and so on.

16:44.640 --> 16:47.480
But notice that this process is completely continuous.

16:47.480 --> 16:50.640
There is no magical flash during development

16:50.640 --> 16:52.280
where you say this is the moment

16:52.280 --> 16:53.960
where you went from being chemistry and physics

16:53.960 --> 16:56.440
as a quiescent oocyte to a being

16:56.440 --> 16:59.680
with metacognitive capacities and so on.

16:59.680 --> 17:03.400
This is a slow and gradual developmental process.

17:03.400 --> 17:06.200
And this is the sort of thing

17:06.200 --> 17:07.040
that we're made of.

17:07.040 --> 17:08.400
Now, this is a free living organism

17:08.400 --> 17:10.160
known as a lacrimaria.

17:10.160 --> 17:12.760
There's no brain, there's no nervous system, it's one cell.

17:12.760 --> 17:15.360
And all of its problems are solved within a single cell.

17:15.360 --> 17:17.720
So it's metabolic needs, it's physiological needs,

17:17.720 --> 17:20.480
it's behavioral, morphological repertoire.

17:20.480 --> 17:23.560
All of this is taken care of in one cell.

17:23.560 --> 17:27.640
So while these individual cells solve little tiny

17:27.640 --> 17:31.120
kind of goal states at the level of a single cell,

17:31.120 --> 17:34.160
together they work towards very large scale

17:34.160 --> 17:36.040
construction projects like this.

17:36.080 --> 17:38.480
And that process, what we're going to do

17:38.480 --> 17:41.320
is look at the involvement in that process

17:41.320 --> 17:43.840
of something that I refer to as intelligence.

17:43.840 --> 17:45.520
What do I mean by intelligence?

17:45.520 --> 17:47.040
I mean what William James meant,

17:47.040 --> 17:49.240
which is the ability to reach the same goal

17:49.240 --> 17:51.120
by different means, that's it.

17:51.120 --> 17:52.760
When I say intelligence, I do not mean

17:52.760 --> 17:54.280
it has to do anything with brains.

17:54.280 --> 17:57.160
I don't mean it has to be this kind of metacognitive,

17:57.160 --> 17:59.480
I know how smart I am or I know what I know.

17:59.480 --> 18:03.720
It just means the ability to deploy some level of competency

18:03.720 --> 18:06.440
to reach the same goal state by different means

18:06.440 --> 18:08.400
depending on what's happening in the environment.

18:08.400 --> 18:10.440
So some level of ingenuity and problem solving.

18:10.440 --> 18:12.440
So let's see some examples.

18:14.280 --> 18:16.880
One thing we know about development is that it's very reliable.

18:16.880 --> 18:20.800
So you start off as a single cell, the egg,

18:20.800 --> 18:23.440
and then reliably this collection of cells

18:23.440 --> 18:25.880
navigates that space of possible shapes

18:25.880 --> 18:28.360
to reach that species specific morphology,

18:28.360 --> 18:29.920
a normal organism.

18:29.920 --> 18:32.880
But actually it's reliable, but it isn't hardwired.

18:32.880 --> 18:34.640
Because if you come along halfway through

18:34.640 --> 18:39.360
and split the embryo in half or in quarters,

18:39.360 --> 18:41.680
you don't get two half bodies, as you would

18:41.680 --> 18:45.120
with a typical device that we've made until now.

18:45.880 --> 18:47.800
What instead you'll get is two perfectly normal

18:47.800 --> 18:49.280
monosygotic twins.

18:49.280 --> 18:51.760
In fact, this is a system that can reach this.

18:51.760 --> 18:55.840
So here's the kind of abstract anatomical morpho space.

18:55.840 --> 18:58.520
Here's the ensemble of states we recognize

18:58.520 --> 18:59.880
as a normal human anatomy.

18:59.880 --> 19:00.800
And you can actually get there

19:00.800 --> 19:04.000
from multiple different starting positions,

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
even avoiding some local maxima,

19:06.000 --> 19:08.480
because this is not a hardwired system.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.520
Not only is regulative development like that,

19:10.520 --> 19:13.800
but in some animals, they do that as adults.

19:13.800 --> 19:16.920
So here's the saxolotl, the salamander

19:16.920 --> 19:20.120
that can regenerate its limbs, its eyes, its jaws,

19:20.120 --> 19:22.040
its spinal cord and tail,

19:22.040 --> 19:24.920
ovaries, portions of the brain and heart.

19:24.920 --> 19:26.680
And what it looks like is this,

19:26.680 --> 19:30.880
if you amputate a leg anywhere along this distance,

19:30.880 --> 19:33.200
what the cells will do is rapidly grow

19:33.200 --> 19:37.280
and undergo morphogenesis to restore exactly what's needed,

19:37.280 --> 19:38.600
and then they stop.

19:38.600 --> 19:40.440
And it can do that from this position,

19:40.440 --> 19:44.680
from any position, it makes only what's needed.

19:44.680 --> 19:46.840
This is the most amazing part of regeneration,

19:46.840 --> 19:48.280
is that it stops.

19:48.280 --> 19:49.480
How does it know when to stop?

19:49.480 --> 19:51.720
Well, it stops when a correct salamander arm

19:51.720 --> 19:53.680
has been completed, that's when it stops.

19:53.680 --> 19:54.960
So we need to start to understand,

19:54.960 --> 19:56.480
how does it know where it's going

19:56.480 --> 19:57.920
in this anatomical morpho space?

19:57.920 --> 20:00.360
How, what are the policies guiding the navigation

20:00.360 --> 20:02.640
in the space of these cells?

20:02.640 --> 20:04.520
And how do they know when they've gotten there?

20:04.520 --> 20:08.000
By the way, this isn't just for frogs and flatworms

20:08.000 --> 20:11.960
and salamanders, humans have some of this

20:11.960 --> 20:14.840
and mammals, some mammals have more.

20:14.840 --> 20:18.000
Of course, the human liver is highly regenerative.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.120
Deer, a large adult mammal,

20:20.120 --> 20:23.760
regenerates up to a centimeter and a half of newborn per day

20:23.760 --> 20:25.840
when they're regrowing their antlers.

20:25.840 --> 20:28.920
And human children can regenerate their fingertips

20:28.920 --> 20:30.280
below a certain age.

20:30.280 --> 20:31.480
If you just keep the wound clean,

20:31.480 --> 20:35.000
they will actually regrow a cosmetically normal fingertip.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.880
So we have this critical question.

20:36.880 --> 20:39.800
How does the collective decision-making of these cell

20:39.800 --> 20:42.920
groups determine what they're supposed to be building,

20:42.920 --> 20:44.200
when they're supposed to stop,

20:44.200 --> 20:46.120
and actually, what are the failure modes?

20:46.120 --> 20:47.760
Why doesn't it work in humans all the time?

20:47.760 --> 20:51.000
Why are we not like axolotls or salamanders?

20:51.000 --> 20:52.720
So we started to study this process

20:53.680 --> 20:55.760
and in particular, starting to look at these questions

20:55.760 --> 20:59.680
of how do collections of cells represent the goal states

20:59.680 --> 21:02.800
that guide their construction projects?

21:02.800 --> 21:06.080
And so we took our inspiration from the nervous system

21:06.080 --> 21:08.360
because if you're trying to think of an example

21:08.360 --> 21:11.720
of a collection of cells that can store large-scale

21:11.720 --> 21:14.320
navigational set points in some kind of space

21:14.320 --> 21:16.960
and then act to implement them and then stop when they're done,

21:16.960 --> 21:18.760
of course, the nervous system is the best example

21:18.760 --> 21:20.880
we have of that.

21:20.880 --> 21:23.800
And so what allows it to do that is this,

21:23.800 --> 21:24.800
the hardware looks like this.

21:24.800 --> 21:27.960
You've got cells we call neurons.

21:27.960 --> 21:30.360
They have these little ion channel proteins

21:30.360 --> 21:32.880
in their cell membranes, which move ions around

21:32.880 --> 21:34.680
and generate a voltage potential.

21:35.960 --> 21:40.080
This may or may not be propagated to their neighbors

21:40.080 --> 21:42.520
via electrical synapses known as gap junctions.

21:42.520 --> 21:46.360
So that's that kind of excitable medium is the hardware.

21:46.360 --> 21:48.720
And what it does is it underlies the software,

21:48.720 --> 21:51.040
which is the physiology of electrical states

21:51.040 --> 21:52.400
moving through the system.

21:52.400 --> 21:54.680
This is a video which this group made

21:54.680 --> 21:59.440
of the real-time electrical activity

21:59.440 --> 22:00.800
in the zebrafish brain.

22:00.800 --> 22:02.760
And it is the commitment of neuroscience

22:02.760 --> 22:06.200
that all of the animal's cognitive capacity,

22:06.200 --> 22:08.400
so all of the computation, all of the memories,

22:08.400 --> 22:11.680
the goals, the preferences, the behavioral repertoires,

22:11.680 --> 22:15.040
all of it is encoded in this electrical activity.

22:15.040 --> 22:17.040
And so there's this process of neural decoding,

22:17.040 --> 22:19.360
this idea that if we knew how,

22:19.360 --> 22:22.520
we would be scanning these electrical states

22:22.520 --> 22:26.680
and decoding them to really understand

22:26.680 --> 22:28.760
what the animal is thinking, what it's seeing, and so on.

22:28.760 --> 22:30.600
Actually, there's been some progress in this,

22:30.600 --> 22:34.760
both in human patients and in mice and so on.

22:34.760 --> 22:37.200
There's been some progress in this neural decoding.

22:37.200 --> 22:39.800
But the really interesting aspect of this

22:39.800 --> 22:42.320
is that this is not unique to the brain.

22:42.320 --> 22:44.600
Every cell in your body has ion channels.

22:44.600 --> 22:47.560
Most cells have these gap junctions to their neighbors.

22:47.560 --> 22:49.320
And you can imagine a very parallel,

22:49.320 --> 22:52.200
and this is what we've been doing for 25 years now,

22:52.200 --> 22:55.000
you can imagine a very parallel process

22:55.000 --> 22:58.280
where you take all of the tools and concepts of neuroscience

22:58.280 --> 23:00.640
and you simply port them outside of the nervous system

23:00.640 --> 23:04.600
and ask, okay, what are the computations

23:04.600 --> 23:06.960
that the rest of the body cells are doing?

23:06.960 --> 23:10.040
And might they underlie a kind of decision-making,

23:10.040 --> 23:11.360
in particular the one we care about,

23:11.360 --> 23:14.720
which is morphogenetic solution to morphogenetic problems,

23:14.720 --> 23:17.440
injury, aging, cancer, and so on.

23:17.440 --> 23:20.800
So what we have here is a really clean isomorphism

23:20.800 --> 23:23.280
where what the nervous system does

23:23.280 --> 23:26.600
is use the electrophysiological software

23:26.600 --> 23:31.480
to make decisions and those decisions result

23:31.480 --> 23:33.440
in signals being given to your muscles,

23:33.440 --> 23:36.120
which move you through three-dimensional space.

23:36.120 --> 23:38.480
But this amazing system didn't evolve out of nowhere.

23:38.480 --> 23:40.280
What actually happened was that it specialized

23:40.280 --> 23:45.200
a far more ancient evolutionary basal bioelectric system,

23:45.200 --> 23:48.200
which works in a very similar way.

23:48.200 --> 23:51.960
It was here long before nerves and muscles evolved.

23:51.960 --> 23:54.400
What it does is exactly the same thing,

23:54.400 --> 23:56.080
networks of electrically active cells

23:56.080 --> 23:57.880
produce bioelectrical signals

23:57.880 --> 24:00.080
that control all of your body cells,

24:00.080 --> 24:01.960
but they don't move you through three-dimensional space,

24:01.960 --> 24:03.400
they move your body configuration

24:03.400 --> 24:05.400
through anatomical morpho space.

24:05.400 --> 24:07.240
This is the system that evolution pivoted

24:07.240 --> 24:08.960
into the control of behavior

24:08.960 --> 24:13.840
when it was speed optimized for nerve and muscle.

24:13.840 --> 24:15.800
And so you can read more about it here,

24:15.800 --> 24:18.240
but the point is that this is as ancient

24:18.240 --> 24:19.560
as bacterial biofilms.

24:19.560 --> 24:21.160
Already evolution had figured out

24:21.160 --> 24:25.440
that processing information, storing memories,

24:25.440 --> 24:30.440
collating inputs from other sort of spatially distant areas

24:31.520 --> 24:34.840
was really well accomplished by bioelectrical networks.

24:34.840 --> 24:37.960
So what we did was we developed some of the first tools

24:37.960 --> 24:40.640
to read and write these electrical pattern memories

24:40.640 --> 24:42.640
in morphogenetic contexts.

24:42.640 --> 24:45.800
So the first is a set of voltage dye techniques,

24:45.800 --> 24:47.280
which, so what you're seeing here

24:47.280 --> 24:49.320
is this is a voltage sensitive fluorescent dye.

24:49.320 --> 24:51.760
This is an early frog embryo.

24:51.760 --> 24:54.200
You're looking at all the conversations

24:54.200 --> 24:55.560
that these cells are having with each other

24:55.560 --> 24:57.960
about who's going to be left, right, dorsal, ventral,

24:57.960 --> 24:58.800
and so on.

24:58.800 --> 25:02.200
And this is a video taken by Danny Adams in our group

25:02.200 --> 25:05.640
that basically allows you to see,

25:05.640 --> 25:08.320
much like people do with scanning activity in the brain,

25:08.320 --> 25:11.160
allows you to see all the electrical conversations.

25:11.160 --> 25:13.320
Now, we can also do a lot of modeling

25:13.320 --> 25:15.320
and look at the various channels and pumps that are there

25:15.320 --> 25:19.080
and ask, how does, where do these gradients come from?

25:19.080 --> 25:21.120
I wanna show you a couple of examples.

25:21.120 --> 25:23.720
This is a time lapse also made by Danny

25:23.720 --> 25:27.400
of the first stages of a frog embryo

25:27.400 --> 25:28.680
putting its face together.

25:28.680 --> 25:30.240
So what you see here, and this is gray scale

25:30.240 --> 25:31.840
instead of colorized, but same idea,

25:32.600 --> 25:34.520
the brightness value indicates voltage.

25:34.520 --> 25:37.320
And this is one frame taken from that video.

25:37.320 --> 25:39.280
So what you can see here is that long before

25:39.280 --> 25:41.040
these organs are actually formed,

25:41.040 --> 25:42.720
the tissue here already has a plan

25:42.720 --> 25:44.240
of where everything is gonna go.

25:44.240 --> 25:47.440
Here's the eye, here's the mouth, here are the placodes,

25:47.440 --> 25:51.400
and this eye is gonna come in shortly thereafter.

25:51.400 --> 25:54.800
What happens is that this is a native

25:54.800 --> 25:58.960
essential component of normal development.

25:58.960 --> 26:03.080
And not only can you monitor this for incipient defects,

26:03.080 --> 26:04.680
but we actually know that this is functional.

26:04.680 --> 26:05.760
This is instructive.

26:05.760 --> 26:07.920
If we move this bioelectrical pattern,

26:07.920 --> 26:10.360
the gene expression changes and the anatomy follows.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.120
I will show you that momentarily.

26:12.120 --> 26:14.560
So this is a normal part of development,

26:14.560 --> 26:17.640
a normal pre-pattern.

26:17.640 --> 26:19.280
This is a pathological pre-pattern

26:19.280 --> 26:21.760
where if we inject a human oncogene,

26:21.760 --> 26:23.240
there will eventually be a tumor.

26:23.240 --> 26:26.280
But even before that tumor becomes histologically apparent,

26:26.280 --> 26:28.480
you can already see using voltage dye

26:28.480 --> 26:30.960
that these cells have basically disconnected

26:30.960 --> 26:31.880
from their neighbors.

26:31.880 --> 26:33.760
And at this point, all they're going to do

26:33.760 --> 26:36.840
is roll back to their ancient amoeba-like lifestyle.

26:36.840 --> 26:38.040
As far as they're concerned,

26:38.040 --> 26:40.440
the rest of the body is just external environment.

26:40.440 --> 26:42.400
So we'll talk about the cancer soon.

26:42.400 --> 26:45.000
So we developed some techniques

26:45.000 --> 26:47.360
to actually start to read these patterns.

26:47.360 --> 26:51.200
And then we developed even the more important component,

26:51.200 --> 26:54.480
which is the functional technology to change them,

26:54.480 --> 26:58.080
to write, not only to read these data states,

26:58.080 --> 26:59.480
but to actually rewrite them.

26:59.480 --> 27:02.120
And we basically took everything from neuroscience.

27:02.120 --> 27:05.360
So there are no waves, no frequencies,

27:05.360 --> 27:07.840
no electromagnetic radiation, no magnets,

27:07.840 --> 27:09.960
and then nothing like that.

27:09.960 --> 27:13.840
What we do is manipulate the native electrical interface

27:13.840 --> 27:16.560
that these cells are using to control each other's behavior,

27:16.560 --> 27:19.120
which are the ion channels and the gap junctions.

27:19.120 --> 27:24.120
So we can genetically, pharmacologically or optically

27:25.240 --> 27:27.200
control the various ion channels

27:27.200 --> 27:29.280
and that changes the voltage states directly,

27:29.280 --> 27:31.200
or we can control the gap junctions,

27:31.200 --> 27:33.000
which determines who talks to whom.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.760
So the topology of the network.

27:34.760 --> 27:36.880
And that corresponds to synaptic plasticity

27:36.880 --> 27:40.640
and intrinsic plasticity if this was a neural tissue.

27:40.640 --> 27:42.440
So now I want to show you some examples

27:42.440 --> 27:43.960
of what happens when you do this, right?

27:43.960 --> 27:46.000
Why do I think that these electrical states

27:46.000 --> 27:48.320
actually mean an eating for morphogenesis?

27:48.320 --> 27:50.720
And so I'll show you a couple of examples.

27:50.720 --> 27:52.120
This is one of them.

27:52.120 --> 27:53.160
So here's an embryo.

27:53.160 --> 27:56.520
I showed you that in that electric face image,

27:56.520 --> 27:59.440
you saw that there was a particular bioelectric pattern

27:59.440 --> 28:01.040
that said put an eye here.

28:01.040 --> 28:03.760
So we simply said, okay, if we recapitulate

28:03.760 --> 28:05.800
that pattern somewhere else,

28:05.800 --> 28:08.200
could we convince other cells to make an eye?

28:08.200 --> 28:10.120
And so in this case, in this example,

28:10.120 --> 28:12.640
we've taken some ion channel RNA

28:12.640 --> 28:14.760
encoding some potassium channels,

28:14.760 --> 28:17.080
which we knew would induce that state.

28:17.080 --> 28:19.560
We inject them into precursors of cells

28:19.560 --> 28:20.600
that are going to make gut.

28:20.600 --> 28:21.840
So this is endoderm.

28:21.840 --> 28:23.160
And sure enough, they will go ahead

28:23.160 --> 28:24.760
and make a very nice eye.

28:24.760 --> 28:28.080
Now this, by the way, is a counter

28:28.080 --> 28:30.560
to what you will see in the developmental biology textbook,

28:30.560 --> 28:33.280
which says that only the anterior norectoderm up here

28:33.280 --> 28:34.640
is competent to make eye.

28:34.640 --> 28:35.480
This isn't true.

28:35.480 --> 28:37.720
Well, it's true if you stick with the master I gene

28:37.720 --> 28:40.560
called PAC-6, but it isn't true if you go upstream

28:40.560 --> 28:41.760
to the bioelectric pattern

28:41.760 --> 28:44.720
and you can make eyes anywhere on the tail, on the gut.

28:44.720 --> 28:47.280
Anyway, notice a couple of interesting things about this.

28:47.280 --> 28:49.640
First of all, that it tells you

28:49.640 --> 28:51.680
that these bioelectric patterns are instructive.

28:51.680 --> 28:55.560
We're not just screwing up some existing process.

28:55.560 --> 28:58.160
We're actually telling these cells to build an organ,

28:58.160 --> 29:00.840
which has all the right lens and retina and optic nerve

29:00.840 --> 29:02.480
and all the right things.

29:02.480 --> 29:04.320
Second is note the modularity.

29:04.320 --> 29:07.000
What we did not do was put in enough information

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
to specify how to build an eye.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.520
You don't have any idea of how to build an eye.

29:10.520 --> 29:12.200
There are lots of different cell types

29:12.200 --> 29:14.600
that are required in a very precise arrangement

29:14.600 --> 29:15.440
to make a proper eye.

29:15.440 --> 29:16.400
We didn't do any of that.

29:16.400 --> 29:20.920
What we did was provide a high level trigger.

29:20.920 --> 29:21.760
If you're a coder,

29:21.760 --> 29:23.760
this is basically a subroutine call

29:23.760 --> 29:26.360
that tells these cells you need to make an eye.

29:26.360 --> 29:27.200
That's it.

29:27.200 --> 29:29.040
Everything else is, all the complexities

29:29.040 --> 29:31.000
pushed onto the system itself,

29:31.000 --> 29:33.240
which is a very nice property for regenerative medicines.

29:33.240 --> 29:34.560
So it's highly modular.

29:34.560 --> 29:37.280
The bioelectric code is not a code for single cells.

29:37.280 --> 29:39.800
It's a code for organs and up.

29:39.800 --> 29:44.800
The other kind of capacity which is really interesting

29:44.800 --> 29:46.600
and this harkens back to this idea

29:46.600 --> 29:49.280
of the cells as a collective intelligence is this.

29:49.280 --> 29:52.200
This is a cross section of a lens sitting out

29:52.200 --> 29:54.800
in the tail of a tadpole somewhere that we've induced.

29:54.800 --> 29:56.800
The blue cells, the labeled cells here

29:56.800 --> 29:59.320
are the ones that have the ectopic ion channel.

29:59.320 --> 30:00.600
But notice what's happening.

30:00.600 --> 30:02.800
There's not enough of them to make a proper lens.

30:02.800 --> 30:04.080
So what they've done is recruit

30:04.080 --> 30:05.680
a bunch of their normal neighbors.

30:05.680 --> 30:07.520
They've hijacked some of these other cells

30:07.520 --> 30:10.240
to participate with them in this construction project.

30:10.240 --> 30:11.600
This is something that often happens

30:11.600 --> 30:14.760
in other collective intelligences like ants and termites

30:14.760 --> 30:17.400
where a few of them will actually recruit

30:17.400 --> 30:21.200
as many neighbors as needed to complete some larger task.

30:21.200 --> 30:24.160
All of that is intrinsic to the tissue.

30:24.160 --> 30:25.520
We did not have to do any of that.

30:25.520 --> 30:27.960
All we said was build an eye.

30:27.960 --> 30:31.280
All of the parts where the cells have to detect

30:31.280 --> 30:32.760
is there enough of us to build the eye?

30:32.760 --> 30:35.280
If not, how do we signal to the other cells to get them?

30:35.280 --> 30:38.120
What should be the size of the eye, the structure of the eye?

30:38.120 --> 30:40.520
All of this is handled by the tissue itself.

30:40.520 --> 30:41.880
What we are doing is taking advantage

30:41.880 --> 30:44.720
of these competencies, including recruitment.

30:44.720 --> 30:47.240
So we can, using these same techniques,

30:48.080 --> 30:50.480
we can make extra forebrains, as you can see here.

30:50.480 --> 30:51.640
We can make extra legs.

30:51.640 --> 30:53.280
Here are some six-legged frogs.

30:53.280 --> 30:57.840
We can make extra hearts, extra odysses or inner ear.

30:57.840 --> 31:00.880
Lots of different organs that we don't know how to make yet.

31:00.880 --> 31:02.080
Also, we can make fins.

31:02.080 --> 31:03.000
This is kind of interesting.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.480
Tatboles aren't supposed to have fins.

31:04.480 --> 31:05.480
That's more of a fish thing.

31:05.480 --> 31:07.880
We'll get to that momentarily.

31:07.880 --> 31:12.480
And so having seen that these bioelectric pattern memories

31:12.480 --> 31:14.440
can actually call up different organs,

31:14.440 --> 31:18.720
we began a project in regenerative medicine of the limb.

31:18.720 --> 31:20.920
And so what happens here in the frog?

31:20.920 --> 31:24.000
Frogs, unlike salamanders, do not regenerate their legs

31:24.000 --> 31:24.840
at this stage.

31:24.840 --> 31:28.000
And so you cut off the leg, and 45 days later,

31:28.000 --> 31:29.440
there's basically nothing.

31:29.440 --> 31:32.080
By the way, within 30 seconds of amputating,

31:32.080 --> 31:34.200
so here's this bioelectrical signal at the wound,

31:34.200 --> 31:37.280
within 30 seconds of this amputation,

31:37.280 --> 31:39.760
you see the opposite untouched leg

31:39.760 --> 31:41.440
has lit up exactly the same way.

31:41.440 --> 31:43.680
So there's some kind of long range, and it's not neural.

31:43.680 --> 31:46.640
You can take out all the spinal cord and all the neurons.

31:46.640 --> 31:47.800
It still works.

31:47.800 --> 31:49.360
There's this long range connection

31:49.360 --> 31:52.560
that kind of carries information

31:52.560 --> 31:54.160
about the anatomical order.

31:54.160 --> 31:58.720
But what we did is we designed a drug cocktail

31:58.720 --> 32:04.160
having to do with the ion levels and thus the voltages

32:04.160 --> 32:05.560
of the cells in the wound to give it

32:05.560 --> 32:09.080
a particular bioelectrical state that says rebuild the leg.

32:09.080 --> 32:10.560
And when we do this, here's what happens.

32:11.120 --> 32:14.560
Within a couple of days, this MSX1 major blastema marker

32:14.560 --> 32:15.240
is expressed.

32:15.240 --> 32:16.360
Here it is.

32:16.360 --> 32:18.560
The leg starts to grow by 45 days later.

32:18.560 --> 32:19.640
You've already got some toes.

32:19.640 --> 32:21.400
You've got a toenail.

32:21.400 --> 32:23.480
Eventually, you get a very respectable leg,

32:23.480 --> 32:25.320
and it's touch sensitive and motile

32:25.320 --> 32:28.160
so the animal can feel it.

32:28.160 --> 32:32.200
The treatment itself is 24 hours with this drug cocktail.

32:32.200 --> 32:35.400
The leg growth in an adult frog takes a year and a half.

32:35.400 --> 32:37.040
You get a year and a half of leg growth

32:37.040 --> 32:38.720
from a 24 hour intervention.

32:38.720 --> 32:41.160
We do not touch them in between.

32:41.160 --> 32:43.240
So the idea is not to micromanage this process.

32:43.240 --> 32:44.920
It's not to tell the stem cells what to do.

32:44.920 --> 32:47.240
It's not to control the morphogenesis.

32:47.240 --> 32:53.720
It's to very early on to shift the navigation policy

32:53.720 --> 32:56.640
of this collection of cells towards building a leg

32:56.640 --> 33:00.480
and away from scarring and blockage.

33:00.480 --> 33:01.000
And that's it.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.440
It's an early stimulus, and then you leave the system alone

33:03.440 --> 33:04.880
and let it do what it needs to do.

33:04.880 --> 33:06.800
So at this point, I have to do a disclosure

33:06.840 --> 33:10.280
because Dave Kaplan and I are scientific co-founders

33:10.280 --> 33:12.680
of a company called Morphosuticals Inc.

33:12.680 --> 33:15.240
And the goal is to take these insights

33:15.240 --> 33:17.280
and now to do this in mammals.

33:17.280 --> 33:20.120
And so the idea is we're currently in mice now,

33:20.120 --> 33:22.520
hopefully someday in human patients,

33:22.520 --> 33:23.840
but obviously we're not there yet.

33:23.840 --> 33:26.080
This is kind of just the beginning.

33:26.080 --> 33:28.320
So at this point, what I'd like to do

33:28.320 --> 33:32.480
is to go back to the planaria and kind of to talk about,

33:32.480 --> 33:34.840
again, the role of bioelectricity

33:34.840 --> 33:36.880
and this idea of pattern memories

33:36.880 --> 33:39.240
and how does it help us to understand

33:39.240 --> 33:41.000
how a body keeps itself together?

33:41.000 --> 33:43.840
Because this is really, in terms of a definitive solution

33:43.840 --> 33:45.360
to aging, this is really it.

33:45.360 --> 33:48.680
We really need to understand how cells come and go

33:48.680 --> 33:49.880
all throughout the lifespan.

33:49.880 --> 33:54.280
How does a particular large-scale anatomy hold together,

33:54.280 --> 33:56.200
even though cells are coming and going?

33:56.200 --> 33:59.560
And what does it take to reinforce that

33:59.560 --> 34:01.320
so that we have a better health span

34:01.320 --> 34:05.160
and that we can retard or abolish this as planaria

34:05.160 --> 34:07.360
have this whole aging process?

34:07.360 --> 34:10.200
So I just want to show you what we've done in planaria.

34:10.200 --> 34:13.760
So here is a typical one-headed flatworm.

34:13.760 --> 34:15.040
So you cut off the head and the tail.

34:15.040 --> 34:17.160
You've got this middle fragment.

34:17.160 --> 34:20.160
This is a genetic marker that shows us

34:20.160 --> 34:21.680
where the anterior cells are.

34:21.680 --> 34:23.720
So these are the cells that think they're

34:23.720 --> 34:27.040
in the front of the worm and so they are.

34:27.040 --> 34:27.880
And so if you do this,

34:27.880 --> 34:28.960
if you cut off the head and the tail,

34:28.960 --> 34:31.640
this middle fragment gives you a nice one-headed worm.

34:31.640 --> 34:32.880
And so we asked a simple question.

34:32.880 --> 34:34.360
How does this middle fragment know

34:34.360 --> 34:36.440
how many heads it's supposed to have?

34:36.440 --> 34:40.000
How many heads should it regrow and at which end?

34:40.000 --> 34:43.880
And so it turns out we've discovered this pathway

34:43.880 --> 34:46.880
involving potassium and proton fluxes.

34:46.880 --> 34:50.720
It's an electric circuit that holds the information

34:50.720 --> 34:52.960
of how many heads you're supposed to have.

34:52.960 --> 34:57.600
And so what you can do is you can visualize it.

34:57.600 --> 34:58.440
Here it is.

34:59.400 --> 35:01.600
This fragment here has a pattern.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.440
This is one head, one tail.

35:03.440 --> 35:05.400
And so what we decided to do was to rewrite it.

35:05.400 --> 35:07.760
And we rewrote it and we said, no, actually two heads.

35:07.760 --> 35:08.640
And this is a little messy.

35:08.640 --> 35:10.960
The technology's still being worked out.

35:10.960 --> 35:14.000
But we said, well, a correct planarian

35:14.000 --> 35:15.440
should have two heads like this.

35:15.440 --> 35:17.360
And then what happens is if you take that animal,

35:17.360 --> 35:19.600
and by the way, the gene expression is still normal.

35:19.600 --> 35:22.900
The anterior genes are still in the front, not in the back.

35:22.900 --> 35:24.560
But if you recut this animal,

35:24.560 --> 35:27.400
what it does is it builds a two-headed flatworm.

35:27.440 --> 35:29.840
This is not Photoshop, these are real.

35:29.840 --> 35:33.080
The reason is because this is the actual pattern

35:33.080 --> 35:35.680
that the cells are using to know what to build

35:35.680 --> 35:36.520
and when to stop.

35:36.520 --> 35:37.760
So I promised you at the beginning

35:37.760 --> 35:40.200
that we were going to look at bioelectricity

35:40.200 --> 35:42.560
as the medium of the collection of intelligence

35:42.560 --> 35:43.400
of these cells.

35:43.400 --> 35:44.920
That's literally what this is.

35:44.920 --> 35:47.000
Very much like people are trying to read memories

35:47.000 --> 35:49.700
of future goal states out of living brains,

35:49.700 --> 35:53.480
we can now read bioelectrical target states out of tissue

35:53.480 --> 35:56.760
to know what it's going to build and rewrite it.

35:57.040 --> 35:58.720
So this is all the cells have to go on.

35:58.720 --> 36:00.560
If the pattern now says two heads,

36:00.560 --> 36:01.600
that's what they're going to build.

36:01.600 --> 36:03.000
There's nothing they have to compare it with.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.400
We've rewritten the target of this homeostatic process.

36:06.400 --> 36:09.280
So really crucial, this electrical map

36:09.280 --> 36:11.280
is not a map of this two-headed animal.

36:11.280 --> 36:13.280
This is a map of this perfectly normal-looking

36:13.280 --> 36:16.400
one-headed animal and before it gets cut.

36:16.400 --> 36:19.080
So basically a single flatworm

36:19.080 --> 36:21.440
can have two different representations

36:21.440 --> 36:23.640
of what a correct body shape is.

36:23.640 --> 36:26.960
And this shows you these large-scale features

36:26.960 --> 36:28.760
of the body shape are literally encoded

36:28.760 --> 36:30.800
in the electrical states of the circuit.

36:31.640 --> 36:33.320
It's actually a kind of counterfactual memory

36:33.320 --> 36:34.960
because it isn't true right now.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.600
This animal does not have two heads right now.

36:36.600 --> 36:40.240
This is a future, it represents what you're going to do

36:40.240 --> 36:42.300
in the future if you get injured.

36:42.300 --> 36:44.120
Now, I keep calling it a memory, why?

36:44.120 --> 36:47.020
Because if we take these two-headed animals

36:47.020 --> 36:48.560
and we amputate the primary head,

36:48.560 --> 36:51.040
we get rid of this ectopic secondary head

36:51.040 --> 36:53.760
and we just let it regenerate in plain water.

36:53.760 --> 36:57.360
It will continue to give rise to two-headed animals forever.

36:58.600 --> 37:00.000
We now know how to set it back.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.840
And here you can see a video of what these guys look like.

37:02.840 --> 37:05.120
So this has all the properties of memory.

37:05.120 --> 37:08.080
It's long-term stable, it's rewritable.

37:08.080 --> 37:10.160
It has conditional recall as I just showed you

37:10.160 --> 37:12.600
and it has some possible discrete behaviors.

37:12.600 --> 37:14.240
So this is quite subtle.

37:14.240 --> 37:17.560
You can ask what determines the number of heads

37:17.560 --> 37:18.520
in the planarian?

37:18.520 --> 37:21.480
Well, on the one hand, what the genome does

37:21.480 --> 37:25.320
is create a machine that has by default

37:25.320 --> 37:28.920
an electrical circuit that naturally by default

37:28.920 --> 37:31.320
will start off saying one head.

37:31.320 --> 37:32.720
But that's not the only thing it can say.

37:32.720 --> 37:33.840
It's reprogrammable.

37:33.840 --> 37:36.860
And in fact, if you change it to say two heads, it will keep.

37:36.860 --> 37:39.120
So the actual number of heads in the planarian

37:39.120 --> 37:40.480
isn't genetically determined at all.

37:40.480 --> 37:42.480
It's genetically determined is the hardware

37:42.480 --> 37:45.800
and a kind of default state that's there

37:45.800 --> 37:47.160
if nothing else happens.

37:48.160 --> 37:50.280
But it's not just about head number.

37:50.280 --> 37:53.040
It's also about head shape or morphology.

37:53.040 --> 37:55.640
So what you can do is you can take this triangular headed

37:55.640 --> 37:58.840
planarian, amputate the head, let the rest of the body

37:58.840 --> 38:00.880
regenerate while you block some of this electrical

38:00.880 --> 38:02.640
communication, it gets confused.

38:02.640 --> 38:04.440
And sometimes it makes the right head,

38:04.440 --> 38:06.200
but sometimes it makes round heads

38:06.200 --> 38:10.640
like this S-meneterania or flat heads like this Pifelina.

38:10.640 --> 38:14.960
These other species are about 100 to 150 million years distant.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.040
There's nothing genetically wrong with any of these animals.

38:17.040 --> 38:20.840
We've done no genomic editing, no synthetic circuits.

38:20.840 --> 38:23.120
Not only the head shape, but the shape of the brain

38:23.120 --> 38:26.160
is just like these other species.

38:26.160 --> 38:29.440
And so what you're doing here is you're exploring other regions

38:29.440 --> 38:32.280
of the morpho space for this genome.

38:32.280 --> 38:34.640
Normally it goes here where it belongs,

38:34.640 --> 38:37.520
but actually it can land in some other attractors that

38:37.520 --> 38:39.560
are typically occupied by other genomes.

38:39.560 --> 38:42.240
But you can visit that in software basically

38:42.240 --> 38:44.480
by just changing the bioelectrical signaling

38:44.480 --> 38:48.200
without actually having to change the genomic hardware.

38:48.200 --> 38:49.600
And you can go further than this.

38:49.600 --> 38:51.520
You can explore the latent morpho space

38:51.520 --> 38:55.840
outwards and look at shapes that don't look like planaria at all.

38:55.840 --> 38:59.200
So you can make these three dimensional cylindrical forms.

38:59.200 --> 39:00.760
You can make these weird spiky shapes.

39:00.760 --> 39:02.800
You can make hybrid forms.

39:02.800 --> 39:06.120
And this ability of cells to build other things

39:06.120 --> 39:11.200
than what they normally build is everywhere.

39:11.200 --> 39:13.920
What evolution gives us when it produces cells and bodies

39:13.960 --> 39:18.600
are a set of really, really highly hackable, highly

39:18.600 --> 39:22.040
programmable machines for solving morphogenetic problems.

39:22.040 --> 39:23.960
And not only bioengineers like us

39:23.960 --> 39:27.120
learn to tap into these controls, but animals do it too.

39:27.120 --> 39:30.200
So for example, in the plant world, this is an oak leaf.

39:30.200 --> 39:32.960
And what's happened here is that you would look at an oak leaf

39:32.960 --> 39:35.280
and you would think that these plant cells have only one

39:35.280 --> 39:39.120
kind of capability, which is to grow this nice flat green thing.

39:39.120 --> 39:41.680
But in fact, what happens is when

39:41.680 --> 39:44.400
you act by an insect embryo, a wasp,

39:44.400 --> 39:46.560
it gets the plant cells to build these kind

39:46.560 --> 39:50.440
of remarkable three dimensional red structures out

39:50.440 --> 39:51.160
of the plant cells.

39:51.160 --> 39:52.080
These are not wasp cells.

39:52.080 --> 39:53.160
These are plant cells.

39:53.160 --> 39:55.600
And so the plant is basically doing what we do rationally.

39:55.600 --> 39:59.920
The wasp does it evolutionarily by providing signals

39:59.920 --> 40:02.160
that trigger these cells to build something completely

40:02.160 --> 40:02.720
different.

40:02.720 --> 40:05.760
So this plasticity, this ability to get cells

40:05.760 --> 40:09.840
to build various things or to reinforce the standard morphology

40:09.840 --> 40:13.400
is really what we're after in the control of growth and form

40:13.400 --> 40:16.440
for the solution to these kind of biomedical problems.

40:16.440 --> 40:19.480
So what we're doing now is building

40:19.480 --> 40:22.200
a full stack computational system

40:22.200 --> 40:25.520
where you can go from the genetics that tell you

40:25.520 --> 40:27.640
which channels and pumps are in the cells

40:27.640 --> 40:29.440
to the bioelectric simulations that

40:29.440 --> 40:32.800
explain why the gradients are in a certain location,

40:32.800 --> 40:34.520
what the behavior of these gradients

40:34.520 --> 40:38.360
are, how they function as a passage of time.

40:38.400 --> 40:40.800
And ultimately, what this means for algorithms,

40:40.800 --> 40:42.880
for human understandable algorithms

40:42.880 --> 40:49.040
to derive anatomical structure from these cell behaviors.

40:49.040 --> 40:52.200
And so the last story that I want to tell you for a few minutes

40:52.200 --> 40:56.600
is really how we use these computational platforms

40:56.600 --> 40:58.560
to repair damage.

40:58.560 --> 41:02.680
And so perhaps the best worked out system in the example

41:02.680 --> 41:05.200
in this is that of the frog brain.

41:05.200 --> 41:07.240
So here's a normal tadpole brain.

41:07.280 --> 41:09.880
Here's the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain.

41:09.880 --> 41:13.840
And there are a wide variety of teratogens, some of them

41:13.840 --> 41:16.200
chemical like nicotine, alcohol, and so on.

41:16.200 --> 41:18.400
And some of them genetic, which I'll show you in a minute,

41:18.400 --> 41:20.080
that mess up brain formation.

41:20.080 --> 41:21.720
So this animal has profound effects.

41:21.720 --> 41:23.640
You can see the brain is completely abnormal.

41:23.640 --> 41:25.080
The eyes are actually connected here.

41:25.080 --> 41:28.120
It's missing the forebrain and so on.

41:28.120 --> 41:31.640
So we asked the question, how could we repair this?

41:31.640 --> 41:34.480
How could we induce repair of such a complex organ?

41:34.480 --> 41:35.880
If we're going to repair, don't we

41:35.880 --> 41:38.200
need to really understand every part of this

41:38.200 --> 41:41.000
and really control every bit of this complicated shape

41:41.000 --> 41:41.880
and function?

41:41.880 --> 41:43.760
So what we did was we built a model,

41:43.760 --> 41:46.120
and this was by our collaborator, Alexis

41:46.120 --> 41:51.120
Pytaq, who created a computational model of the bioelectrical

41:51.120 --> 41:55.160
pattern that we observed that normally tells this brain what

41:55.160 --> 41:56.960
size and shape to be.

41:56.960 --> 41:59.400
And we analyzed this computational model

41:59.400 --> 42:02.760
to understand all the various ways that it could go wrong.

42:02.800 --> 42:05.320
And in particular, we asked the model

42:05.320 --> 42:08.240
to work backwards and to suggest an ion channel,

42:08.240 --> 42:10.640
that we can, or one or more ion channels,

42:10.640 --> 42:13.160
that we could open or close to get the pattern

42:13.160 --> 42:16.000
to the correct state from an incorrect state.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.720
So what you have here is you have a computer model

42:18.720 --> 42:22.680
of the bioelectrics going on inside of a sheet of the nascent

42:22.680 --> 42:24.960
brain cells, and the pattern isn't correct.

42:24.960 --> 42:27.120
And so you asked the model, if I wanted to get this bioelectric

42:27.120 --> 42:29.080
pattern back to where it should be,

42:29.080 --> 42:30.080
what would I need to do?

42:30.080 --> 42:32.280
What channels would I open and close?

42:32.320 --> 42:35.120
And this particular model said something very interesting.

42:35.120 --> 42:38.640
It pointed us to this thing called the HCN2 ion channel.

42:38.640 --> 42:41.560
The HCN2 ion channel has a very particular interesting

42:41.560 --> 42:43.160
property, long story short.

42:43.160 --> 42:46.160
It acts kind of like a sharpen filter in Photoshop.

42:46.160 --> 42:48.160
What it does is it sharpens voltage gradients

42:48.160 --> 42:52.400
between regions of cells with different voltages.

42:52.400 --> 42:56.960
And here's what that looks like.

42:56.960 --> 42:59.880
I'm showing you the toughest example we have,

42:59.880 --> 43:02.520
which is instead of a drug like nicotine or alcohol

43:02.520 --> 43:05.160
or something like that, we used a genetic mutation

43:05.160 --> 43:07.280
of the notch pathway.

43:07.280 --> 43:09.520
Notch is a really critical neurogenesis gene.

43:09.520 --> 43:11.600
It's very important for formation of the brain.

43:11.600 --> 43:12.680
This is a normal brain.

43:12.680 --> 43:14.760
This is a brain of an animal with a notch mutation.

43:14.760 --> 43:16.560
You can see the forebrain is gone.

43:16.560 --> 43:18.360
The midbrain and hindbrain are a big bubble.

43:18.360 --> 43:19.400
They have no behavior.

43:19.400 --> 43:22.000
They just lay there doing nothing.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.360
So what we did was exactly what the model said,

43:24.360 --> 43:28.400
which is that we treated it with one of two drugs that

43:28.440 --> 43:30.240
opened up these HCN2 channels.

43:30.240 --> 43:34.240
These, by the way, are already human-approved anti-epileptics.

43:34.240 --> 43:37.640
And what happens is that the animals are repaired.

43:37.640 --> 43:38.760
They get their brains back.

43:38.760 --> 43:41.600
They not only get their normal anatomy back,

43:41.600 --> 43:43.400
but they get their IQs back.

43:43.400 --> 43:45.560
They are, in terms of learning rate,

43:45.560 --> 43:47.440
they are now indistinguishable from controls,

43:47.440 --> 43:49.200
whereas these guys could barely move.

43:49.200 --> 43:52.880
And so what you see here is that some disorders,

43:52.880 --> 43:54.920
and I'm not saying this is true for all of them,

43:54.920 --> 43:58.640
but for some disorders, really nasty hardware problems

43:58.640 --> 44:00.240
can, in fact, be fixed in software.

44:00.240 --> 44:04.240
All we did was temporarily open a particular ion channel

44:04.240 --> 44:06.840
to trigger this kind of improvement

44:06.840 --> 44:08.880
of the native bioelectrical pattern.

44:08.880 --> 44:13.880
So the whole pipeline looks something like this,

44:14.840 --> 44:16.520
where we will have a system,

44:16.520 --> 44:19.560
and you can already play with an early version of this online,

44:19.560 --> 44:23.560
where you choose the tissues or organs that you're interested in,

44:23.600 --> 44:25.480
whether normal or cancerous.

44:25.480 --> 44:27.880
It knows all the ion channels that are expressed there,

44:27.880 --> 44:31.200
because these are all present in databases and the literature.

44:31.200 --> 44:32.680
And then there's the simulator,

44:32.680 --> 44:34.360
which tells you which of these channels

44:34.360 --> 44:35.440
you would need to open or close

44:35.440 --> 44:37.440
to get this back to the correct state.

44:37.440 --> 44:39.080
And that allows you, once you know which channels,

44:39.080 --> 44:40.160
that allows you to pick a drug,

44:40.160 --> 44:43.680
because something like 20% of all drugs

44:43.680 --> 44:46.640
are ion channel drugs,

44:46.640 --> 44:49.800
which means there's a huge potential pool

44:49.800 --> 44:51.360
of so-called electroseuticals

44:51.360 --> 44:54.280
that can be used to infer

44:54.280 --> 44:56.840
how to make these changes from this computer model.

44:58.160 --> 45:00.880
Just one kind of quick piece of information

45:00.880 --> 45:02.640
to remind us that this is not all

45:02.640 --> 45:05.000
just for these lower animals that we work with.

45:05.000 --> 45:06.640
All of these different ion channels,

45:06.640 --> 45:08.160
which work exactly the same way

45:08.160 --> 45:09.880
in that some of our model systems

45:09.880 --> 45:14.120
have all come out of channelopathy studies in human patients.

45:14.120 --> 45:16.720
And in fact, if you look at the gene expression

45:16.760 --> 45:21.760
downstream of various bioelectrical interventions,

45:22.560 --> 45:23.680
as we did here,

45:25.160 --> 45:28.000
the genes downstream of frog axolotl

45:28.000 --> 45:30.840
and human mesenchymal stem cells are overlapping.

45:30.840 --> 45:32.000
So the targets are all the same.

45:32.000 --> 45:33.360
So this is a very ancient,

45:33.360 --> 45:35.960
highly conserved system for body regulation.

45:35.960 --> 45:37.680
And we have a lot of confidence

45:37.680 --> 45:40.760
because of what we learn now in animal models

45:40.760 --> 45:44.120
is gonna work well in medicine.

45:44.120 --> 45:46.720
So just for a couple of minutes,

45:46.720 --> 45:50.400
the last story I wanna tell you is about cancer.

45:50.400 --> 45:52.560
So what we have here, again,

45:52.560 --> 45:54.360
let's just remind ourselves what bodies are

45:54.360 --> 45:57.000
because the right question for cancer

45:57.000 --> 45:58.200
isn't why we get cancer.

45:58.200 --> 46:00.120
The right question is, I think,

46:00.120 --> 46:02.560
why isn't all cancer all the time?

46:02.560 --> 46:04.120
Why is there anything other than cancer?

46:04.120 --> 46:07.000
Because we are made of individual cells

46:07.000 --> 46:09.480
that used to be individual organisms

46:09.480 --> 46:13.080
that basically have two goals,

46:13.080 --> 46:14.680
to go wherever life is good,

46:14.680 --> 46:16.560
be metabolically and to proliferate

46:16.560 --> 46:18.840
for each cell to become two cells.

46:18.840 --> 46:20.200
But what evolution has done

46:20.200 --> 46:22.240
is given them some amazing hardware,

46:22.240 --> 46:23.560
including bioelectrical hardware,

46:23.560 --> 46:25.960
but also biochemical and biomechanical,

46:25.960 --> 46:26.800
that allows them to,

46:26.800 --> 46:29.280
instead of working on unicellular level,

46:29.280 --> 46:30.720
tiny little projects,

46:30.720 --> 46:33.560
what they do is they work towards something much bigger.

46:33.560 --> 46:36.520
They, together as a collective,

46:36.520 --> 46:38.320
they navigate anatomical space

46:38.320 --> 46:39.960
to build something like this.

46:39.960 --> 46:40.800
And if it gets damaged,

46:40.800 --> 46:42.880
they will rebuild it very much like ants do

46:42.880 --> 46:46.360
for an ant colony and so on.

46:46.360 --> 46:48.120
They continue to build something very large,

46:48.120 --> 46:50.880
but this whole system has a failure mode,

46:50.880 --> 46:52.720
and that failure mode is cancer.

46:52.720 --> 46:55.400
This is glial blastoma in vitro.

46:56.520 --> 46:58.560
What happens is that when individual cells

46:58.560 --> 47:01.800
get disconnected from this collective,

47:01.800 --> 47:06.160
they go back to their ancient unicellular past.

47:06.160 --> 47:08.280
As far as they're concerned,

47:08.280 --> 47:10.160
the rest of the body is external environment.

47:10.160 --> 47:12.440
They're no more selfish than the rest of your body cells

47:12.520 --> 47:14.640
is just that their cells are smaller.

47:14.640 --> 47:19.640
Cancer is a reduction of the diameter of the self.

47:19.800 --> 47:21.920
So from something very large,

47:21.920 --> 47:23.960
where they're all part of building this one organ,

47:23.960 --> 47:26.360
now it shrinks down to the level of a single cell,

47:26.360 --> 47:29.040
and it just goes to pursue little single cell agendas.

47:30.320 --> 47:32.000
So what we decided to do

47:32.000 --> 47:34.800
was to use this kind of very strange way of thinking about it

47:34.800 --> 47:36.240
to develop a therapeutic.

47:36.240 --> 47:40.240
And so here are these tumors that are injected,

47:40.240 --> 47:42.240
that are caused by injecting human oncogenes,

47:42.240 --> 47:44.840
for example, nasty K-RAS mutants and so on.

47:44.840 --> 47:47.400
And you can see here, the oncogen is labeled.

47:47.400 --> 47:48.360
It's in red.

47:48.360 --> 47:49.680
It's very strong in this area.

47:49.680 --> 47:50.680
In fact, it's all over the place.

47:50.680 --> 47:51.840
This is the same animal.

47:53.000 --> 47:54.000
There's no tumor,

47:54.000 --> 47:56.240
because even though if you were to sequence this genetically,

47:56.240 --> 47:57.400
you would see the mutation, you would say,

47:57.400 --> 48:00.080
ah, well, this is of course gonna be a tumor here.

48:00.080 --> 48:02.560
There isn't any tumor despite them.

48:02.560 --> 48:03.560
The oncogen is still there.

48:03.560 --> 48:04.400
We haven't gotten rid of it.

48:04.400 --> 48:05.560
It's quite strong,

48:05.560 --> 48:08.440
but the cells, we force the cells to electrically

48:08.440 --> 48:11.360
remain connected to the rest of the tissue

48:11.360 --> 48:14.920
by including an ion channel that sets a particular voltage.

48:14.920 --> 48:18.080
And we've basically forced them to remain part

48:18.080 --> 48:20.480
of this construction project that builds nice skin

48:20.480 --> 48:23.200
and nice muscle, regardless of what the oncogene is telling

48:23.200 --> 48:26.320
it to do, which is to disconnect and go off on your own.

48:26.320 --> 48:28.080
So you can see that, and so we're now,

48:28.080 --> 48:32.640
we're currently in human glioblastoma kind of applications

48:32.640 --> 48:35.680
to see if we can transition this to medicine.

48:35.680 --> 48:39.240
So I'm gonna just summarize and then give you a couple

48:40.120 --> 48:42.720
of bigger thoughts.

48:42.720 --> 48:44.880
So what I've tried to argue is that

48:44.880 --> 48:46.720
there's a physiological software layer

48:46.720 --> 48:49.120
that sits between the genotype and the anatomy.

48:49.120 --> 48:52.840
And it's a really important tractable target for biomedicine.

48:52.840 --> 48:56.400
It's not all about the molecular details of the genome.

48:56.400 --> 48:59.600
There's actually this physiological layer that's critical.

48:59.600 --> 49:02.600
Evolution discovered very early on how powerful

49:02.600 --> 49:05.240
the electrical component is of that layer

49:05.240 --> 49:08.360
and lots of cells hack each other's behavior

49:08.400 --> 49:12.320
by controlling these large scale electrical patterns.

49:12.320 --> 49:16.120
We think that cracking this code in the sense of neural,

49:16.120 --> 49:18.000
in the same sense as neural decoding

49:18.000 --> 49:22.480
will reveal how cell networks and tissues

49:22.480 --> 49:23.840
make group decisions.

49:23.840 --> 49:25.360
And so we already have applications

49:25.360 --> 49:27.840
where we can rewrite these pattern memories

49:27.840 --> 49:31.600
to program new large scale shapes.

49:31.600 --> 49:33.240
And there's some really exciting AI tools

49:33.240 --> 49:35.720
that are coming online for the design

49:35.720 --> 49:39.040
of specific strategies for regenerative medicine.

49:39.040 --> 49:41.880
So this is going to be anything

49:41.880 --> 49:45.920
that's going to help us control real time growth and form

49:45.920 --> 49:48.600
is going to be really critical for the aging problem.

49:48.600 --> 49:50.880
And in bigger picture,

49:50.880 --> 49:52.960
I think that bioelectrical signaling

49:52.960 --> 49:55.280
is very much like it does in the brain,

49:55.280 --> 49:57.160
serves as a kind of cognitive glue

49:57.160 --> 50:00.720
that binds individual cells towards larger purpose,

50:00.720 --> 50:04.320
which is to maintain an organism against disorder,

50:04.320 --> 50:07.200
which is aging cancer and everything else.

50:07.200 --> 50:10.600
So kind of the last thing I just want to mention

50:10.600 --> 50:14.720
is if we look at the space of all biomedical interventions,

50:14.720 --> 50:18.000
you've got basically bottom up conventional strategies

50:18.000 --> 50:21.120
which are all of these kind of hardware focus things.

50:21.120 --> 50:23.800
And then you've got some ways to treat this top down.

50:23.800 --> 50:28.000
And this is only now beginning to be sort of exploited.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.360
And you can see lots more in these papers.

50:31.360 --> 50:35.200
But this is where we get to take advantage

50:35.200 --> 50:37.520
of the native intelligence of cells and tissues.

50:37.520 --> 50:39.120
The fact that they're not just clockwork,

50:39.120 --> 50:40.600
they have specific,

50:40.600 --> 50:42.680
because they used to be independent organisms,

50:42.680 --> 50:44.920
they have preferences, they have competencies,

50:44.920 --> 50:46.600
they have memory, they have trainability,

50:46.600 --> 50:48.760
I haven't even mentioned all of those,

50:48.760 --> 50:50.400
the data for all of that.

50:50.400 --> 50:54.680
But there's a large field of emerging information on that.

50:54.680 --> 50:56.680
And really being able to take advantage of it

50:56.680 --> 50:58.160
is extremely powerful.

50:58.640 --> 50:59.720
And this is key.

50:59.720 --> 51:04.080
People who study placebo effects and expectation effects

51:04.080 --> 51:05.160
and really at this point,

51:05.160 --> 51:09.160
anybody who studies any kind of drug action

51:09.160 --> 51:11.000
has realized that the mind plays

51:11.000 --> 51:12.800
a really important part in this.

51:12.800 --> 51:16.080
And so Fabrizio Benedetti has this great quote that I love,

51:16.080 --> 51:18.360
which is that words and drugs

51:18.360 --> 51:20.120
have the same mechanism of action.

51:20.120 --> 51:22.120
And he literally uses a brain scanning

51:22.120 --> 51:23.400
and those kinds of technologies

51:23.400 --> 51:25.240
to really show the mechanism of action

51:25.240 --> 51:27.920
of having expectations about what various pharmaceuticals

51:27.920 --> 51:30.840
do versus what the actual pharmaceutical does.

51:30.840 --> 51:32.320
And I think that bioelectricity

51:32.320 --> 51:35.360
is an incredibly attractive target

51:35.360 --> 51:37.040
as a communication interface

51:37.040 --> 51:39.000
between large scale intelligence,

51:39.000 --> 51:42.960
between your expectations of these contextual

51:42.960 --> 51:47.200
of behavioral cues, which is what informs a lot of,

51:47.200 --> 51:51.520
whether a lot of how successful certain pharmaceuticals

51:51.520 --> 51:55.080
are going to be and the actual molecular level outcomes.

51:55.080 --> 51:59.720
Because as a human being or as any other animal,

51:59.720 --> 52:01.280
your decision to get out of bed in the morning,

52:01.280 --> 52:03.680
this high level kind of executive decision

52:03.680 --> 52:05.320
of what you want to do,

52:05.320 --> 52:07.880
has to filter down to change the molecular properties

52:07.880 --> 52:09.880
of the cell membrane in your muscle cells.

52:09.880 --> 52:10.720
In order to get out of bed,

52:10.720 --> 52:12.560
you have to depolarize those muscle cells.

52:12.560 --> 52:14.960
And so that bioelectric interface

52:14.960 --> 52:19.800
is literally what takes a high level content

52:19.800 --> 52:23.960
of an intelligent metacognitive individual

52:23.960 --> 52:27.640
and converts it into changes of molecular signaling

52:27.640 --> 52:28.720
within the cells.

52:28.720 --> 52:31.400
And with bioelectricity is what does that.

52:31.400 --> 52:35.280
And if we understood really how to manipulate that pathway,

52:35.280 --> 52:38.480
we could have really, really radical medical applications

52:38.480 --> 52:42.280
that are completely different than trying to cobble together

52:42.280 --> 52:44.040
the addressing of symptoms bottom up

52:44.040 --> 52:46.160
via drug design and things like that.

52:46.160 --> 52:47.000
So I'll stop here.

52:47.000 --> 52:50.400
I'm gonna thank all the students and postdocs

52:50.400 --> 52:53.280
who did all the work and my many collaborators.

52:53.280 --> 52:54.960
Again, three disclosures.

52:54.960 --> 52:57.640
These are companies that we work with.

52:57.640 --> 53:00.320
Our other funders are here

53:00.320 --> 53:02.320
and most of all the model systems

53:02.320 --> 53:04.760
because the animals do all the heavy lifting here.

53:04.760 --> 53:05.800
So thank you.

53:05.800 --> 53:07.800
I'll stop here and take any questions.

53:11.680 --> 53:15.160
I just want to say, wow, that was great.

53:15.160 --> 53:16.600
Thank you so much.

53:16.600 --> 53:17.440
Thank you.

53:17.440 --> 53:18.960
Absolutely fantastic.

53:20.080 --> 53:20.920
I appreciate it.

53:20.920 --> 53:21.760
Thank you.

53:22.040 --> 53:23.360
That was amazing.

53:23.360 --> 53:24.560
Yes, thank you.

53:24.560 --> 53:26.840
Michael, yeah, mind-blowing stuff.

53:26.840 --> 53:27.880
Hi, how are you doing?

53:27.880 --> 53:29.040
Hello.

53:29.040 --> 53:31.240
Yeah, I've been meaning to ask you

53:31.240 --> 53:35.360
and just trying to get my head around this bioelectric pattern

53:35.360 --> 53:36.840
that you're referring to.

53:36.840 --> 53:40.680
So how is it distributed across the organism?

53:40.680 --> 53:43.520
You have different ion channels active

53:43.520 --> 53:45.680
in different parts of the organism.

53:45.680 --> 53:48.640
How do you set it up?

53:48.640 --> 53:54.600
Yeah, that's true in that there are, of course,

53:54.600 --> 53:57.440
regionalizations of ion channel expression.

53:57.440 --> 54:00.200
But that isn't the major part of it

54:00.200 --> 54:04.520
because remember that if you imagine a field of cells

54:04.520 --> 54:07.240
where every cell has exactly the same ion channels,

54:07.240 --> 54:09.040
exactly the same ion channels,

54:09.040 --> 54:11.560
you can still have all kinds of complex patterns

54:11.560 --> 54:15.080
of bioelectric states because of self-organization

54:15.080 --> 54:18.160
of think of touring patterns and the chemical.

54:18.160 --> 54:20.320
So this is very familiar to people

54:20.320 --> 54:21.360
who think about chemical signals.

54:21.360 --> 54:22.960
You can have a well-mixed medium

54:22.960 --> 54:25.880
where all the chemicals are homogenous

54:25.880 --> 54:27.400
and yet you can have these very complex

54:27.400 --> 54:28.760
self-organizing patterns.

54:28.760 --> 54:31.120
Exactly the same thing is true in the bioelectric circuits.

54:31.120 --> 54:34.080
You don't need to necessarily have different ion channels

54:34.080 --> 54:35.840
to have different electrical states.

54:35.840 --> 54:40.680
You can self-organize very kind of clever patterns.

54:40.680 --> 54:44.040
But on top of that is overlay the fact that actually,

54:44.040 --> 54:46.000
yes, some cells do have different ion channels

54:46.000 --> 54:46.840
than other cells.

54:48.680 --> 54:52.720
But when you control like where the eye goes, for example,

54:52.720 --> 54:55.840
you go and localize your ion channel

54:55.840 --> 54:58.880
and the state of these channels.

54:58.880 --> 55:01.520
So yeah, so yeah, there's two ways.

55:01.520 --> 55:04.000
There's two, we have two applications that I showed you.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.320
One is, yeah, in a case of the eye,

55:06.320 --> 55:10.400
we inject the channel RNA into a specific region

55:10.400 --> 55:12.080
because that's where we want the eye to form.

55:12.080 --> 55:14.440
So there's some localization there.

55:14.440 --> 55:16.640
On the other hand, for example,

55:16.640 --> 55:19.280
in the work that we did to induce,

55:19.280 --> 55:22.040
let's say tail regeneration in a tap hole

55:22.040 --> 55:24.000
that normally won't regenerate it,

55:24.000 --> 55:27.280
we soak the whole animal and only the wound at the tail

55:27.280 --> 55:29.360
is what actually regenerates.

55:29.360 --> 55:31.800
We didn't provide any spatial specificity

55:31.800 --> 55:34.000
and that's because there's also an element

55:34.000 --> 55:36.080
and this is something else that's sort of stolen

55:36.080 --> 55:38.560
from neuroscience here is there's an element

55:38.560 --> 55:39.720
of attention in the system.

55:39.720 --> 55:41.760
So the cells that are not injured

55:41.760 --> 55:44.640
that are in a quiescent location where everything is good,

55:44.640 --> 55:46.720
they ignored our signal completely.

55:46.720 --> 55:48.640
And so it's only the cells at the wound

55:48.640 --> 55:51.920
that need to know what to do that actually responded

55:51.920 --> 55:54.040
and they grew a tail, the rest of it didn't did nothing.

55:54.040 --> 55:56.680
And we have many, many examples of that actually.

55:56.680 --> 55:58.120
The same thing for those,

55:58.120 --> 56:00.760
for the anti-epileptics to repair the brain,

56:00.760 --> 56:03.200
we didn't inject them in a specific location.

56:03.200 --> 56:05.920
We soak the whole animal and the brain was repaired

56:05.920 --> 56:06.760
and everything else.

56:06.760 --> 56:10.280
In fact, in fact, other things got slightly better.

56:10.280 --> 56:12.120
That's a whole other thing is that it's actually

56:12.120 --> 56:15.640
a tune up for the whole organism, other organs,

56:15.640 --> 56:18.040
developmental noise, which is like this variation,

56:18.040 --> 56:21.200
normal variation, all of that got crunched down

56:21.200 --> 56:25.400
into these embryos look like, I had scored them myself

56:25.400 --> 56:28.720
when I first saw this effect, I looked at it myself,

56:28.720 --> 56:30.280
they look like they come off an assembly line.

56:30.280 --> 56:32.200
I mean, it would just like perfect,

56:32.200 --> 56:34.080
like every, each one was exactly like each other

56:34.080 --> 56:35.880
just reduces the noise.

56:35.880 --> 56:40.160
So we didn't have to produce any spatial specificity there.

56:40.280 --> 56:42.720
Do wounds have electrical signals?

56:42.720 --> 56:43.720
Sorry?

56:43.720 --> 56:46.320
Do wounds emit electrical signals?

56:46.320 --> 56:47.160
Yes, yes.

56:47.160 --> 56:49.720
This has been studied, I believe the first work on this

56:49.720 --> 56:53.160
was like in the 1880s or something.

56:53.160 --> 56:54.080
Yes, absolutely.

56:54.080 --> 56:57.120
So every epithelial layer has a voltage across it.

56:57.120 --> 56:59.120
And if you poke a hole in it, it'll short circuit

56:59.120 --> 57:01.440
and all the cells nearby know where the wound is

57:01.440 --> 57:03.240
by following the electric field lines.

57:03.240 --> 57:04.800
And these things have been measured by,

57:04.800 --> 57:08.000
I think Emil Dubois Ramon was the first to measure this

57:08.000 --> 57:09.200
in the late 1800s.

57:09.200 --> 57:10.840
This has been around for a long time.

57:10.840 --> 57:14.240
We've had several questions in the chat queue

57:14.240 --> 57:15.640
that I'd like to get to now.

57:15.640 --> 57:19.800
I noticed Miles has had his hand up, he organized this.

57:19.800 --> 57:22.800
So he gets priority, Miles.

57:22.800 --> 57:26.600
And I don't recall who was asking another question

57:26.600 --> 57:30.320
that may have been Paul or someone will,

57:30.320 --> 57:32.760
we'll get back to you, Miles.

57:34.240 --> 57:35.000
Thank you, Johnny.

57:35.000 --> 57:38.320
I don't claim the probability, but thank you very much.

57:38.320 --> 57:42.480
Dr. Levine, sorry, I'm from British,

57:42.480 --> 57:45.760
British expression in South Africa, we say Levine.

57:45.760 --> 57:48.800
But okay, the two things I wanted to talk about

57:48.800 --> 57:53.000
was neural cellular automator.

57:53.000 --> 57:55.360
Neural, if I don't know if you've come across the term

57:55.360 --> 57:58.640
because they say they are inspired by your work.

57:59.480 --> 58:02.360
So there's this distilled.pub.

58:03.920 --> 58:05.720
That was our paper.

58:05.720 --> 58:06.560
Yeah, yeah.

58:07.120 --> 58:10.400
We collaborated with Alex Mardvintsov's team.

58:10.400 --> 58:11.960
Yeah, I know the papers you made.

58:11.960 --> 58:13.200
Okay, thank you, thank you.

58:13.200 --> 58:14.960
So that's the one thing.

58:14.960 --> 58:16.680
So that then I'm, that's answered my question.

58:16.680 --> 58:20.080
So that's basically modeling the same thing in software.

58:20.080 --> 58:24.560
And the other question was that we have a paper from

58:24.560 --> 58:28.320
Judd Hough, I think it was 2019,

58:28.320 --> 58:31.400
showing that in the adult, in the adult,

58:31.400 --> 58:36.240
the human adult, any mammal or eukaryote,

58:36.280 --> 58:39.720
there is the embryonic program

58:39.720 --> 58:44.720
and the fetal program of development in the genome,

58:45.880 --> 58:47.200
but it is switched off.

58:48.400 --> 58:51.920
And they've been able to, well, I suppose,

58:51.920 --> 58:53.120
look at the Yamanaka factors,

58:53.120 --> 58:55.840
in a sense they seem to be switching them on again.

58:55.840 --> 59:00.160
So the embryonic program and the fetal program

59:00.160 --> 59:03.640
are switched off, they are called hypo, hypo methylated.

59:04.640 --> 59:07.280
I don't know if you're familiar with this or what?

59:07.280 --> 59:08.440
We also familiar with this.

59:08.440 --> 59:10.560
Okay, then that also answers my question.

59:11.920 --> 59:17.680
Yeah, I mean, the thing with the Yamanaka factors

59:17.680 --> 59:19.440
is that what you're doing there

59:19.440 --> 59:22.960
is regulating single cell state.

59:22.960 --> 59:24.840
So you're telling one cell

59:24.840 --> 59:27.400
that it's a primitive embryonic-like cell

59:27.400 --> 59:30.160
and from there, that cell needs to be able

59:30.160 --> 59:31.760
to figure out what to do by itself.

59:31.840 --> 59:33.720
The problems that we've been talking about

59:33.720 --> 59:35.560
are not single cell problems.

59:35.560 --> 59:37.720
They are large-scale morphogenetic problems

59:37.720 --> 59:42.720
and if all you do is set up a bunch of undifferentiated cells

59:43.920 --> 59:46.880
without the proper anatomical cues,

59:46.880 --> 59:49.280
what you will end up with is at best the teratoma

59:49.280 --> 59:52.680
or some other kind of a tumor that grows out of control.

59:52.680 --> 59:54.800
It's not enough to have,

59:54.800 --> 59:56.920
the cells themselves are like the building blocks.

59:56.920 --> 59:58.920
Yes, you need undifferentiated cells

59:58.920 --> 01:00:00.280
to make the various tissues,

01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:01.120
but it isn't enough.

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:02.480
By themselves, you will not get

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:04.880
the three-dimensional correct patterning.

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:08.400
So I think that obviously the Yamanaka factors

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:11.600
are incredibly interesting and important as a technology,

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:13.960
but it doesn't provide the answer

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:14.800
to what we're looking for.

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:15.640
I don't think.

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:19.160
All right.

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:20.000
Thank you very much.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:20.840
Thank you very much.

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:21.680
Just one last comment.

01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:22.520
Oh yeah.

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:23.640
The doctors in play at Harvard,

01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:27.760
they show that when they crush the optic nerve in a mouse,

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:30.960
the same biochemical pathways were stimulated

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:34.680
as during the OSK Yamanaka factors.

01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:36.200
So it's as if the wound

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:38.480
had the same effect as the reprogramming.

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:41.120
Yeah, yeah, I'm not surprised.

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:45.240
I mean, yes, and I know David's worked quite well.

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:46.240
I'm not surprised.

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:48.440
I think that's a fantastic finding.

01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:51.400
And I think that that's the right way to do this.

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:56.240
In other words, it's the cellular environment

01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:58.280
and the pattern memories in that environment

01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:00.240
that are needed to tell the cells what to do.

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:03.360
It's not enough to just have plastic cells bottom up.

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:06.960
Very good.

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:09.800
Justin's next in queue.

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:12.200
Actually, kudos to Justin.

01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:15.880
He's doing some outstanding things in our community.

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:20.880
He's been making videos lately

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:25.000
and I was honored to present one on genomic analysis

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.160
and longevity gene.

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:29.720
So Justin, do you wanna read this or Dr. Levin?

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:32.480
Do you wanna just read this yourself?

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:35.880
It's up on the screen now.

01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:36.720
Yeah, I see it.

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:44.360
Well, it's hard to say more influential.

01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:49.480
It's sort of like, I mean, they go hand in hand.

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:51.920
It's the right way to think about this

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:56.000
is using the framework of software and hardware.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000
So without the right hardware,

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.600
your software is not going to do anything.

01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:03.280
So hardware is really important

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:04.400
and that's what the genetics does.

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:06.440
The genetics nails down the cellular hardware

01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:07.560
that you have.

01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:11.200
However, if the hardware is good

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:14.640
and biological hardware is definitely of that class,

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:16.920
the hardware does not by itself

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:18.320
determine what's going to happen.

01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:21.240
It's the actual software and the reprogrammability

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:23.480
features that are going to determine what happens.

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:25.400
And I showed you one example.

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:26.760
Well, I showed you several examples

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:29.200
where the physiology overrides the genetics.

01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:32.200
So you can make worms with the wrong species heads

01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:34.080
even though the genetics is normal.

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:38.160
You can make animals with a very nasty oncogenic mutation

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:40.320
which in fact do not get cancer

01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:42.880
even though the genetics are wrong.

01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:46.000
And you can have a notch mutation

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.560
and still get a normal brain

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:50.920
if the electrophysiology is managed correctly.

01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:53.200
So I'm certainly not going to say

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:54.320
that genetics isn't important.

01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:56.240
It's critical.

01:02:56.240 --> 01:03:00.600
But we now have ways to override the default behaviors

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:02.160
that are given by the genetics.

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:04.000
And I think we now have a better understanding

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.640
of what the genetics does.

01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:07.040
It doesn't code directly

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:09.520
for any of these form and functions.

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:11.800
It's just the beginning of the control path.

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:12.640
Okay.

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:14.880
Yeah, I mainly ask that just because for so many years

01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:15.720
and years and years,

01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:18.000
so much funding has gone into genetics.

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:23.040
And that's the solution to aging and rejuvenation.

01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:27.960
But it seems as though that's a minor part of the issue

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:30.520
listening to you and seeing the work that you've done.

01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:33.400
Yeah, I hesitate to say minor.

01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:35.040
I think it's also going to be important

01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:38.400
because I can imagine sort of a two-part solution

01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:41.120
where you need both, right?

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:44.920
So one can think about what actually happens

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:45.840
during regeneration.

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:49.480
Is it that cells are no longer remembering

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:50.640
the correct pattern memories

01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:53.000
to keep up the tissues of the body?

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.800
Or perhaps that information is there,

01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:56.840
but the cells are unable to execute.

01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:58.800
So we actually don't know the answer to that.

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:00.960
And it's entirely possible that you will need both.

01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:02.560
You'll need a way to strengthen

01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:04.720
the bioelectric pattern memory.

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:08.920
And you will need a way to improve the cells' abilities

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:09.760
to obey.

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:12.880
And that may be some kind of, you know,

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:16.440
have a genetic or biochemical component to it.

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:20.600
And Justin, was your next question answered?

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:26.120
Yes, my next question was answered, that's right.

01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:28.680
Okay, next in line, John Kramer.

01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:32.240
And anyone who wants to ask a question verbally,

01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:36.000
please click the little hand raising icon

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.200
and we'll put you in queue.

01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:43.280
Okay, John, okay, how did the planar get energy

01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:45.080
and biomass to regenerate?

01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:48.120
I have an idea, but Dr. Levin.

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:51.640
Yeah, what happens is it's actually extremely interesting.

01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:56.640
These planarians, when the fragment starts to regenerate,

01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:01.400
it actually starts to shrink

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:03.120
because it has to be the correct size

01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:04.920
to match the tiny little heads and tails

01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:05.840
that are gonna be formed, right?

01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:07.360
It's trying to keep proportional.

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:10.120
So it shrinks and the way it shrinks is through autophagy.

01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:12.600
So it actually eats some of its own tissues

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:15.760
and that ends up being used to rebuild.

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:17.960
And in fact, even without injury,

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:21.120
the worm is constantly remodeling.

01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:23.000
So if you starve it over months,

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.480
they will just get smaller and smaller,

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:26.080
but they keep perfect proportions.

01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:27.920
So they're constantly remodeling themselves.

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:30.120
And once you feed them, they sort of get bigger

01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:34.120
and they stay in the right allometric scaling throughout.

01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:35.680
Amazing.

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:37.160
All right, Jameson,

01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:42.000
which genes affected right after making changes?

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.600
Yeah, so I can give you a whole list.

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:48.320
We analyzed all this in several publications.

01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:50.040
So I can send you the list.

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:52.800
There are many, all of the kinds of things

01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:53.640
that you've heard of.

01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:57.520
So Wnt pathway, BMP, FGF,

01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:01.480
all of those pathways are there, but it's thousands.

01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:04.640
There are many, many genes that are targeted.

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:09.640
All right, John Kramer, Pacific Eye Unchained Drugs.

01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:12.240
Yeah, that depends on the drug.

01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:14.960
There are some drugs that are extremely dirty

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:15.960
and non-specific.

01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:18.480
There are other drugs that are much more specific.

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:23.040
The good news for some of these applications

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:25.400
is that you actually don't want to be too specific

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:30.400
because if you take, if you, let's say you block KV 2.1,

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:33.760
well, KV 2.2 is right there to take its place.

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:35.920
And so you sometimes want something

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:37.640
that will take out a whole family or in fact,

01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:40.520
a whole class to make the change that you want.

01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:44.280
But it varies greatly across the different drugs.

01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:47.400
Okay.

01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:49.960
Paul.

01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:52.560
Yeah, I have a question with your,

01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:55.760
with respect to your hardware, software analogy,

01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:58.800
I've been in computer science for many, many, many years.

01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:01.800
So I know something about that.

01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:04.640
And Mike, it's more a comment from you

01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:09.640
because the difference I see between the biological things

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:13.080
and computer software and hardware

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:15.320
is that with computer hardware,

01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:19.840
the hardware doesn't generate and determine the software

01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:21.000
in any sense.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.720
In other words, you build a piece of hardware

01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:25.960
and you don't automatically get software programs

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:27.560
that are running it, okay?

01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:31.720
So how does the, and so I want your comment is the idea

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:36.480
of how does the genome and the basic biology

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:39.360
generate the software in a sense?

01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:40.360
Yeah.

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:42.920
So what you're saying is true

01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:46.680
with respect to the classic kind of architecture

01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:51.480
where those two things are quite separate, right?

01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:52.320
So you build a hardware

01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:54.120
and then somebody else has to put the software on it.

01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:57.480
That of course is only one type of computing device.

01:07:57.480 --> 01:08:01.480
So we now have self-organizing computational systems

01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:04.400
where nobody has to put the software on top.

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:07.600
So this is the field of self-organizing robotics,

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:11.520
artificial life, where we build these circuits that have a,

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:16.040
so just imagine a collection of,

01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:19.240
we can start thinking about this as a collection

01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:23.160
of electronic components for a simple analog computer, right?

01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:24.680
When you've got the components,

01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:26.040
if you connect them up in the right way,

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:27.720
you're going to get spontaneous behavior.

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:30.480
The whole thing is an electronic dynamical system.

01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:32.600
It's going to have spontaneous behavior.

01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:34.640
And depending on what the components are,

01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:36.360
we can interpret that behavior

01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:37.880
as various kinds of computations.

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:39.880
There's going to be inputs, there are going to be outputs

01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:43.320
and nobody had to explicitly program a thing.

01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:45.160
All of those computational behaviors

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:48.720
are a feature of the dynamical components of the system.

01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:51.800
Now, the trick of course is to get the right components

01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:56.440
that take advantage of various laws of computation.

01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:59.600
The fact that, just to give you a simple example,

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:01.240
these ion channels,

01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:04.040
there are voltage-gated current conductances.

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:05.480
They're basically a transistor.

01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:08.480
So if you have a circuit in the right way,

01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:09.520
you can make logic gates.

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:10.640
If you can make logic gates,

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:12.320
then you have various computations.

01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:15.080
All of that is a kind of a dynamic,

01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:17.320
you can take a dynamical systems approach to it

01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:19.560
and think of it that way, but it's much more powerful

01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:21.960
if you actually ask what computations is it doing.

01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:26.960
So I think in biology, we have very well developed

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.640
something that the computer technology

01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:30.720
is only just starting to exploit,

01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:34.000
which is self-organizing computational circuits.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.320
That's what I think we have.

01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:38.600
Robert, young, I like where you're going.

01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:41.600
Ideas for applying this to solve aging.

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:47.960
Well, yeah, and I'm certainly not an aging expert.

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:51.560
We don't have any work directly on aging yet.

01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:56.120
The idea is I think that the solution to aging

01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:58.440
is going to basically fall out of the solution

01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:02.000
to all of these other disorders of morphogenesis.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.600
I think that aging is fundamentally a disorder

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:06.360
of morphogenetic control.

01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:11.120
And when we, and I don't mean just my lab at the field

01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:14.160
as a whole, when we solve this problem

01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:16.040
of maintaining morphogenetic control,

01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:17.960
aging will be one of the applications

01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:20.800
along with regeneration, along with cancer reprogramming

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:21.640
and so on.

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:26.200
I think the key is to ask how do the cells know

01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:27.800
what to do in the first place?

01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:29.280
And the solutions to that

01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:31.240
will be the solutions to aging as well.

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:33.720
Very good.

01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:35.520
Next, another one from Jason.

01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:37.580
Let me adjust my screen.

01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:40.360
Mine was just more of a comment

01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:44.680
to Robert's question on how might be applied to aging.

01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:46.000
Okay.

01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:48.360
Jeff, Parker.

01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:51.000
Yeah.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.520
Yeah, so tissue regrowth after scarring.

01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:57.840
So we don't have any published data in mammals yet,

01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:02.120
but we did do work in the frog where we showed that

01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:05.120
even after it scars over with this,

01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:08.240
what they call a non-permissive epithelium,

01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:10.280
which normally doesn't allow the thing to regenerate,

01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:12.440
this like thick epithelium,

01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:14.040
we can still trigger regeneration.

01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:15.520
So I'm optimistic.

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:19.080
But if you're asking about human patients,

01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:20.360
we don't have any data on that yet.

01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:21.200
So we'll see.

01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:23.560
Okay.

01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:26.080
And Jeff's next question.

01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:31.480
I've applied to common degenerative diseases of aging.

01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:35.440
Well, you may have applied to answer some of that.

01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:38.120
Yeah, yeah, again, I don't know.

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:43.120
We don't have data on mammalian arthritis or COPD.

01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:46.480
We haven't done that,

01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:49.920
but I think that to the extent that we figure out

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:52.440
where normal lung tissue comes from in the first place

01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:54.760
or what a normal joint is supposed to be,

01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:57.880
we will be able to trigger that regenerative process

01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:58.720
throughout.

01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:03.720
So my hope is to be able to continuously induce

01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:07.680
and up-regulate basically like what planaria do,

01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:10.600
where they're constantly refreshing their tissues

01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:11.440
all the time.

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:14.760
Okay.

01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:21.280
Jason would be interested in seeing that map.

01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:23.640
Sorry, what map are we talking about?

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:26.040
At one point you were talking about sort of a mapping

01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:30.600
between a bioelectric signal and a change in genes

01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:32.200
or a change in gene expression.

01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:33.480
Oh, gene expression, I see.

01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:35.880
Yeah, yeah, I can, yeah, that's fine.

01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:38.760
Drop me an email and I'll send you the paper.

01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:42.120
I'll warn you in advance that we did it

01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:44.640
because a lot of people are interested in that question,

01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:49.640
but I found it highly kind of uninformative

01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:55.200
because what it does is it tells you

01:12:56.360 --> 01:13:00.960
how individual cells are altered by the bioelectrical change,

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:04.400
but all the problems that we're actually interested in

01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:06.200
are not single cell problems.

01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:09.000
So knowing what happens to individual,

01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:15.800
what happens to the individual transcripts in single cells

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:19.080
is that hasn't actually told us very much

01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:21.280
about how to control the whole business.

01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:25.480
So when you turn on the eye pattern,

01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:31.680
you see that you start to turn on all of the eye genes.

01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:34.760
So you get Paxix and Rick Swan and all of these things.

01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:36.680
Someone's microgones on and it's fading back.

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:39.640
Hang on.

01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:43.000
Okay, we're good.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.840
Go ahead, please, sorry.

01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:46.280
Yep, no problem.

01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:49.000
So you see that those things are turned on,

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.480
but what you'd really like to know

01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:52.840
is how did that collection of cells,

01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:54.640
it's not a single cell question,

01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:57.520
how did that whole field of cells take,

01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:00.120
convert that bioelectric pattern

01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:02.400
and decide that that maps onto an eye

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:04.480
rather than some other organ?

01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:06.320
Not what happened to individual cells,

01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:08.920
but what's the large scale decoding?

01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:11.440
So we know the genes,

01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:14.240
but that doesn't actually answer the question.

01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:17.160
And so it's some of the other kinds of approaches

01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:19.920
that we've taken with large scale modeling

01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:21.920
and some of the machine learning and so on

01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:24.120
that are really going to answer this.

01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:26.440
Yeah, it seems like you sort of need a mapping

01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:28.560
then between a bioelectric signal

01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:31.680
and how it alters actual tissues or organs, right?

01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:32.520
That's exactly right.

01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:33.880
That's exactly right.

01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:35.200
That's the bioelectric code.

01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:37.320
That is precisely what we're trying to map out.

01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:38.960
Just a quick follow up.

01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:41.720
How do you see this area of research interfacing

01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:44.120
with areas like quantum biology?

01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:46.560
Yeah, good question.

01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:48.160
I've been asked that before.

01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:50.760
I don't know specifically for quantum biology.

01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:55.040
I'm not an expert in quantum anything and I don't know.

01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:57.560
So far, everything that we've been doing here

01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:59.080
is purely classical.

01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:04.080
We don't use any quantum formalisms yet.

01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:07.840
We basically just use standard neuroscience,

01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:09.280
standard electrophysiology

01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:13.120
and standard connectionist kinds of network modeling.

01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:14.240
So I don't know.

01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:18.640
I don't know if there's a role for quantum kinds of processes.

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:20.880
I assume biology exploits it

01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:23.440
like it exploits everything else that it can,

01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:26.200
but our models don't include that right now.

01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:28.480
Thank you.

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:34.680
Okay, a couple more questions in chat.

01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:39.120
I will copy them, but first I had one.

01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:42.280
How can we support your work?

01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:44.880
Well, thank you.

01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:49.520
I guess at this point, where the field is

01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:52.600
is that we know what to do.

01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:54.080
We're not stuck anywhere.

01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:57.560
There are no great fundamental blockades

01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:58.800
other than resources.

01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:01.440
So right now it's pretty scalable,

01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:03.520
meaning that if we had more people working on this,

01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:04.480
it would move faster.

01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:08.480
It's not every field is at that stage,

01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:09.680
but this one kind of is.

01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:13.200
So yeah, if you know of any leads on,

01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:18.200
and we have lots of potential sources for funding,

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:23.400
but all of them take up significant time,

01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:26.360
the pursuit of research funding takes significant time.

01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:30.640
So any leads on that are helpful.

01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:33.360
That's basically the rate-limiting step at this point.

01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:40.520
Okay, I'm going to, since Miles has given so,

01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:44.360
oops, sorry, given so much of his time

01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:47.520
to organize this and other meetings, he gives priority.

01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:50.640
So are using any AI tools?

01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:56.200
Yeah, we use a variety of AI techniques.

01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:58.720
We don't really use any off-the-shelf tools

01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:00.200
that I can think of.

01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:02.880
We basically make most of our own.

01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:07.880
And the idea is to understand the decision-making

01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:13.600
and the memory of the cells themselves.

01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:14.880
So it's kind of a tight,

01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:18.400
we're not just using AI tools to crunch the data,

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:20.960
we're actually trying to understand the cells

01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:23.120
as a kind of intelligence, you know,

01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:24.960
artificial or not that that kind of doesn't matter,

01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:27.480
but it's a kind of unconventional intelligence.

01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:29.920
And we're trying to use it.

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:37.280
Yeah, Roy Cutler, good to see you again.

01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:43.920
And I'll reformat this.

01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:48.120
Are you able to reverse?

01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:49.560
You can read it.

01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:54.560
Yeah, sort of in the case of,

01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:58.720
so for example, in the case of the leg regeneration,

01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:01.000
that's part of what happens.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.080
It's not so much reversing.

01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:04.520
It's, you know, for example, in the frog,

01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:08.200
much like in the human, there's no de-differentiation.

01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:09.720
It just, skin makes more skin,

01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:12.040
muscle makes muscle, bone makes bone and so on.

01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:14.920
It induces tissue renewal and patterning.

01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:16.600
It's not so much,

01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:19.320
it's not so much necessarily a differentiation issue,

01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:21.880
but we have, for example, in vitro,

01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:26.280
you can control human mesenchymal stem cells that way.

01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:28.480
What we bi-electrically, you can control

01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:30.440
whether or not they differentiate.

01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:33.600
So this is one way to control differentiation,

01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:35.600
but that again, that's not really enough

01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:39.280
to, that's not where the power of the approach lies.

01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:42.280
And how are you set for time?

01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:44.720
Do you have time for a few more?

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:46.560
I will tell you, what time is it?

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:48.480
I got about five minutes.

01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:50.880
Okay, Jeff's question,

01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:54.400
and I will be reformatting another one or two

01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:55.560
that are in chat.

01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:58.680
Let's see, companies work well.

01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:02.960
What, yeah, I can't say too much other than we do,

01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:07.160
we do have this company called Morphosuticals Inc.

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:12.160
And we're focusing on limb regeneration and stay tuned.

01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:14.440
There will be papers coming out,

01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:16.840
hopefully later this year.

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:21.840
All right, John's, yeah, John's question, optical.

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:25.240
Yeah, we've used optogenetics.

01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:27.400
We've used optogenetics to trigger regeneration,

01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:30.280
to trigger limb formation, to suppress cancer.

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:34.120
Unclear to me whether that's gonna be really

01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:35.280
the way to go in the clinic,

01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:39.320
because it requires the cells to be expressing

01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:41.960
a light-gated ion channel,

01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:43.360
which is very good in the laboratory,

01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:44.920
because then you know exactly what you've done,

01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:46.280
and it's very nice.

01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:50.600
But you don't want to have to give your patient

01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:53.680
gene therapy to get those light-sensitive channels in there.

01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:57.680
So I'm not sure that will actually be how we do the clinic.

01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:04.040
Okay, and I was popping and I trust that includes

01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:08.400
an answer to John's second question.

01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:12.360
John Kramer, developing drugs and...

01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:15.240
Okay.

01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:18.680
Yeah, well, there's a huge amount of emphasis

01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:22.000
on discovering new drugs for ion channels.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:25.480
So lots of the big pharma companies are doing that

01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:27.600
for other reasons, not having anything to do

01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:32.320
with bioelectricity necessarily, but so yes,

01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:35.920
but that's not really the right limiting step right now.

01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:37.920
We have plenty of drugs for ion channels.

01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:40.800
I mean, we can always use more, but the issue isn't

01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:43.520
that we don't have enough drugs for specific channels.

01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:48.040
The issue largely is that we don't have enough physiomic data.

01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:53.040
So we need bioelectrical state data on a health and disease

01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:58.120
and a wide range of tissues across patients, all of that.

01:20:58.120 --> 01:21:01.560
And then we can develop specific strategies.

01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:03.400
Cool.

01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:08.040
Let's see, next, John Wenger.

01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:12.600
And I see, I mean, you said five minutes,

01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:14.080
so I'm taking that literally,

01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:16.840
and I think we have about two and a half left.

01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:19.000
So I'm watching the clock here

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.120
because I want to keep you on schedule.

01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:26.120
Yeah, we've never, I have no idea, in a planarian,

01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:28.760
we've never done anything like that,

01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:30.400
it's physically moving cells around.

01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:32.360
So I don't know what would happen.

01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:33.200
Okay.

01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:41.320
And Justin's question, in case you can't see it all,

01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:42.520
I'll reformat it.

01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:49.560
Yeah, I understand the question.

01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:51.880
I'm not sure we're gonna have to worry

01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:55.040
about the correct places in the correct period of time.

01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:58.480
In the frog, for example, we soak the whole animal

01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:00.040
and we do it for 24 hours

01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:01.600
and then we don't touch them again.

01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:04.440
And that is enough to trigger a year and a half

01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:07.000
of new organ growth in the correct place.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:11.480
And so my hope is that if we correctly understand

01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:16.800
if we correctly understand how the cells

01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:18.320
process this information,

01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:22.240
we're not gonna have to micromanage the delivery spatially.

01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:27.320
Yeah, the magnetic field of the earth.

01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:31.880
Well, so we know that the magnetic field

01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:33.440
is important for some things,

01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:36.440
as you say, like navigations and navigation,

01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:40.400
the kinds of electrical signals that we are working with,

01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:45.840
the weak field of the earth doesn't really impact them.

01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:47.400
I mean, people have done experiments

01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:50.200
where you shield them off from the magnetic field

01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:52.360
of the earth using new metal and things like that.

01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:55.400
And some people, there have been some effects reported,

01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:57.880
but it's not, it's really kind of,

01:22:57.880 --> 01:23:00.200
there's not this really strong evidence

01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:02.160
for the need of a magnetic field

01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:06.240
for the kinds of very, very kind of strong electrical exchanges

01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:07.440
that we're talking about.

01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:10.080
Hey.

01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:10.920
Outstanding.

01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:14.040
Thank you so much.

01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:15.880
Miles, quick one.

01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:18.000
Just the last question, just the last question,

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:18.920
Dr. Levine.

01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:22.640
So if you wanted to control the electric field

01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:26.200
down to a more granular level with you

01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:29.240
on the embryonic, during the embryonic stage,

01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:32.840
would you be looking at things like nanotechnology

01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:37.840
or sort of point conductors to sort of change

01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:40.080
the shape of the embryos?

01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:45.080
You could, but my own thinking is that that's,

01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:46.720
we actually want to go in the wrong,

01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:48.040
in the opposite direction.

01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:52.200
We don't want to be micromanaging the minute states.

01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:56.160
We want to have very low information content,

01:23:56.160 --> 01:23:59.440
large scale signals that let the cells themselves

01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:01.160
handle all of the details.

01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:02.440
In everything that we've done,

01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:04.560
the most powerful interventions are the ones

01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:06.400
where we leave the most to the cells,

01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:08.200
where we do not try to micromanage it.

01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:10.280
I'm sure there will be applications where that's useful,

01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:13.360
maybe especially in synthetic morphology,

01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:16.120
but I don't think that's long-term.

01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:17.920
I don't think that's the way here.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.720
Well, as some guy who used to travel around

01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:25.760
the galaxies on a starship used to say, fascinating.

01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:28.200
Thank you so much.

01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:29.120
Thank you so much, everybody.

01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:30.080
Great, great discussion.

01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:30.920
Really appreciate it.

01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:31.840
Thank you.

01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:32.680
Thanks.

01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:33.520
Bye-bye.

01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:34.360
Great job.

01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:35.200
Thank you.

01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:36.020
Thank you.

01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:39.400
Okay.

01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:43.960
If anyone has something else to say,

01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:45.520
it's going to be a hard act to follow.

01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:48.240
Any other thoughts, ideas?

01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:53.520
Next topic, Miles,

01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:58.600
I believe you had another thing or two to say.

01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:02.080
Yes, no, no, he caught the scientific community

01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:06.160
completely unprepared from left field.

01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:08.400
He totally, I think about 10, 15 years ago

01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:12.160
when he started, it was totally like Jason was saying,

01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:15.080
the focus was on the genes.

01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:18.600
And this level of control, which is comprehensive,

01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:23.600
it's the actual morphology was completely unexpected.

01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:28.160
So that's why, I mean, amazing is he's broken the barrier

01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:29.760
for organ formation.

01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:33.880
You see the extra limbs, the extra legs,

01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:36.320
you see them coming out of the frog.

01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:38.800
And that was a massive, massive advance.

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:40.960
So he's really done something fantastic.

01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:47.300
Well, Miles, what was your next agenda item?

01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:52.760
Well, it was actually the next agenda item was after him,

01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:56.320
I did keep something else, which was the fact that

01:25:56.320 --> 01:26:00.120
we have a complete, this has been a discovery in 2019,

01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:01.120
something very interesting,

01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:03.040
which I found very, very interesting.

01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:07.320
There is a complete record of the program

01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:12.320
of your embryonic stage and your fetal stage in your cells.

01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:16.840
You've got a record and it is not just there,

01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:21.880
it is carefully packed away and it is tagged, it's tagged.

01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:26.440
And it seems that the people from Harvard,

01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:29.440
Dr. St. Clair has been starting to talk about this now,

01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:31.560
because manipulating that program,

01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:34.680
which I think is what Dr. Levine's work is partially doing,

01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:38.640
he's busy manipulating this program that's packed away,

01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:40.520
is gonna be the next big thing,

01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:45.120
the next big thing in anti-aging and in medicine,

01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:46.400
in surgery.

01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:49.320
I was gonna to flash very quickly the relevant paper,

01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:52.340
if you don't mind, just quickly flash the paper.

01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:56.880
Let me just see which one was it.

01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:10.000
Oops.

01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:14.400
Sorry people, I'm just looking for my,

01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:18.720
okay, let me just check if I can see the paper.

01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:24.880
Yes, I don't know if you, can you see that?

01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:26.000
Yes.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:26.840
Are you able to see that?

01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:29.040
Is it over the place?

01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:32.520
Sorry, can you see the paper?

01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:35.240
Yes, it could be a little larger.

01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:39.200
Okay, no, I think Johnny, I'm using Linux tonight,

01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:42.240
I've had issues with my Windows computer,

01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:43.720
so I'm using Linux.

01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:46.480
So I think I'll just, if you can't see it,

01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:50.440
the title is Extensive Recovery of Embryonic Enhancer

01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:51.640
and Gene Memory.

01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:55.520
Gene memory stored in hypermethylated enhancer DNA.

01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:58.720
The title doesn't quite do justice to what they are

01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:02.120
describing because it's actually earth shattering.

01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:05.520
Basically what they're saying is your embryonic program

01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:08.920
is still with you, it's still packed away in your genome,

01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:10.600
as well as your fetal program,

01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:13.360
because there's a difference between the embryonic program

01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:16.320
and the fetal program, basically the embryo

01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:20.640
is formed in the first eight, first, what's it?

01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:24.200
Let me put it this way, the embryo is formed first

01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:27.800
up to about the eighth week of pregnancy

01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:30.280
and then after that you're a foetus.

01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:33.160
And the two stages uses different sections

01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:35.480
of the genome to make you.

01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:37.680
And what's fantastic is that the program

01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:42.440
that was used to make you 98% of it is still in your DNA,

01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:45.840
carefully packed away and also tagged.

01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:47.200
So what people are starting to do

01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:49.320
is just sort of manipulate this program.

01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:51.240
And I think that's what Dr. Levine is doing,

01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:53.600
he's actually manipulating this program,

01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:56.080
which is why we see this perfect restarting

01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:57.880
of the growth of organs.

01:28:57.880 --> 01:28:59.960
So that's something I wanted, I have not,

01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:01.200
I didn't put it on our group

01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:04.520
because I wasn't sure how long Dr. Levine would be.

01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:06.720
Maybe we can have another discussion later on,

01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:08.240
but I thought I'd just throw this in here

01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:10.720
because this is also quite earth shattering.

01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:15.200
The fact that you can rerun,

01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:17.720
you can rerun the development mental program

01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:19.800
because it is still in you.

01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:27.600
I don't know if there was any questions about that.

01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:28.440
Yeah.

01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:43.040
That's a big breakthrough, an important thing to know,

01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:48.040
and one component of the program to aging.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:51.040
Go ahead.

01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:51.960
Yes.

01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:53.560
Yeah, this is John Wenger.

01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:57.400
So I'm remembering,

01:29:57.400 --> 01:30:00.760
I think it might have been from my introductory

01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:02.600
college zoology class,

01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:07.200
but there's a saying that with regard to development,

01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:09.200
and that I think was something like

01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:12.240
ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:15.560
I'm not even wondering about phylogeny.

01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:18.040
Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.

01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:19.600
Phylogeny is right, yeah.

01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:23.200
Yeah, and the, and this seems relevant.

01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:25.840
I mean, it seems like what we're talking now,

01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:28.400
what you just said is a slight elaboration

01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:32.760
of that principle, namely that the whole genome

01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:35.360
is there for the different stages of development

01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:40.360
starting from an embryo to a fetus, et cetera, et cetera.

01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:45.720
And now people are trying to figure out

01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:48.400
how to replay parts of those things.

01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:54.400
The, it's really handy that all this,

01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:01.560
these genetic patterns of development and our youths

01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:04.360
are preserved because as we get older,

01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:08.400
where our genome are controlling active,

01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:12.240
our current genome gets corrupted, we think.

01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:17.240
And so the idea of, and people talk about taking your,

01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:21.880
your genes and doing gene banking or your DNA banking

01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:23.320
and that sort of thing.

01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:27.400
Well, if it turns out that the younger DNA

01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:29.720
is still in our system somewhere,

01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:33.320
a different piece of the total genome,

01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:35.920
well, that's handy because then that gives you access

01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:39.800
to a younger genome and that obviously bears

01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:43.000
on the problem of aging reversal.

01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:47.640
Absolutely, yes, correct.

01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:48.480
Absolutely.

01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:50.880
Which is exciting.

01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:55.600
Extremely, it's as if the biology has handed us a gift.

01:31:57.400 --> 01:32:01.240
Yeah, well, it's not exactly the, I mean,

01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:06.240
it's, I don't think biology, yeah, it is as if the candidate

01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:12.600
is a gift, but in a sense, I mean,

01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:14.360
it's kind of interesting, it's always been there.

01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:16.600
We just need to open our eyes and look at it.

01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:18.400
That requires the right kind of eyes

01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:21.600
and the right kind of mind to be able to see that.

01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:26.600
But I really liked Michael's conception

01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:30.160
because I really think that genetics

01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:32.840
is sort of taken over biology.

01:32:32.840 --> 01:32:37.840
And I think he's right that the real intelligence,

01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:43.120
well, not all of the, all the information's not in the genome.

01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:49.240
There's something about what Heb called cell assemblies,

01:32:49.240 --> 01:32:51.800
the notion of where does intelligence come from?

01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:55.400
And the notion is that the neurons would organize

01:32:55.400 --> 01:32:57.920
into cell assemblies with various functions.

01:32:57.920 --> 01:33:02.440
And it's clear that different chunks of the body

01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:05.120
have their own internal intelligence.

01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:07.280
That's why I asked the question about what would happen

01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:12.280
if you took, injected some eye cells and some hearing cells.

01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:15.440
I don't even know if Plenaria can hear,

01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:18.480
but how would they determine whether to grow an eye

01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:23.160
or an ear, sort of Plenaria ear in the same place?

01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:28.160
Well, these organizational fields would have to,

01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:32.760
in some sense, either fight it out or coexist.

01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:35.960
And maybe they would segregate themselves voluntarily.

01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:40.360
And so you'd have an eye in the tail and an ear in the tail,

01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:42.800
not in the very same spot, but nearby,

01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:45.040
not in the head, but back in the tail.

01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:48.920
And so I really think that he's really onto it.

01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:51.840
I mean, it's so, it's just mind blowing.

01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:54.840
It's such an important discovery

01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:59.080
because there's so much information.

01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:02.280
That's why I was asking the question too about the optics.

01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:04.040
In one of his earlier slides,

01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:05.480
and Johnny, you did have this recorded.

01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:07.240
I really hope you can see this.

01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:09.320
I'd like to look at his slides some more.

01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:14.320
There was an optogenetic term in one of his manipulations there,

01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:18.600
but it strikes me that there may be,

01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:20.360
just as there are electrical ways,

01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:23.000
he's manipulating with electrical fields,

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.720
but there are other fields too, there are optical fields.

01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:30.720
And the bigger picture might be the combined manipulation

01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:34.480
with electrical fields and optical fields.

01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:40.480
Because nature is very, very clever

01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:43.480
at using things in combination.

01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:47.720
I think that's sort of the point of his talk.

01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:50.320
So I've kind of gone up for a little bit here,

01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:52.400
but I hope I've stimulated a few thoughts.

01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:58.240
I'm finding, I found that talk to be really

01:34:58.240 --> 01:35:02.040
changing my perspective on the direction we've been going.

01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:05.440
It almost seems like our focus on drugs

01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:08.280
and even gene editing in CRISPR,

01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:12.440
we're still reprogramming the computer with a soldering iron.

01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:13.280
That's right.

01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:15.800
That's absolutely right.

01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:20.960
Approach is no, we're gonna create software to change life.

01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:25.440
And it's pretty mind-boggling.

01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:28.400
I think the issue is not that we should be creating,

01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:29.800
we should be creating the software,

01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:33.040
we should be locating the software that's already in us

01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:36.200
and exploiting that software and giving it a chance

01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:37.960
to function in an older body

01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:40.160
as it functioned in a younger body.

01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:41.960
I think the software is already in us.

01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:46.960
If our genome contains our fetal plan

01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:53.200
and our embryonic plan, our fetal plan, et cetera,

01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:57.520
and our infant plan and the child plan

01:35:57.520 --> 01:35:59.640
and the teenager plan and the adult plan,

01:35:59.640 --> 01:36:02.560
if it's all in there for the cells,

01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:05.120
then it's also in there for the software.

01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:06.360
Why would it not be?

01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:08.480
If the genome contains all of that,

01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:11.840
then it probably also contains the ability

01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:15.200
to read the associated software with it.

01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:17.400
That is to say the software is a property

01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:22.400
of the ensemble of the cells.

01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:24.480
Yeah, well, I'd like to offer a thought.

01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:27.440
I am an electrical engineer by training.

01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:31.640
I've worked with circuits and also quite a bit with software.

01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:35.240
This is nothing like hardware and software.

01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:37.440
This is something different.

01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:40.200
I think we can at the conceptual level

01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:43.080
think about higher level controls,

01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:48.080
but if you look at all the mechanisms

01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:51.760
for synthesizing proteins for replication,

01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:55.560
that's not hardware or software,

01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:59.880
and bears a lot of thought.

01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:02.120
I mean, there are some very high level,

01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:07.120
long state machines in the biology.

01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:12.080
So how this whole field pattern,

01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:16.640
biological appearance communicates with that

01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:17.680
is very interesting,

01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:21.440
but I wouldn't oversimplify it with that comparison.

01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:23.160
Good.

01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:26.640
Can you hear me now?

01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:28.280
Can we get rid of the slides?

01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:29.120
Yes.

01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:32.240
In a moment, can you hear me now?

01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:35.680
Okay, because my expensive Yeti microphone cut off again,

01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:39.360
so I guess I'll have to reinstall the drivers or something.

01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:44.360
Robert had a really great question that brings us back.

01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:47.440
So just how are we gonna use this to solve aging?

01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:49.200
Does anyone have any ideas?

01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:55.280
I was dropping in the chat a few of my thoughts there too.

01:37:56.280 --> 01:37:59.320
Yeah, I think with this approach,

01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:02.680
it just depends on how detailed your map is.

01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:07.680
I mean, if you know with one electrical signal

01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:10.040
that it would have a certain physiological,

01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:11.840
biological response,

01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:15.160
and you had that across every type of signal

01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:17.320
and every type of response,

01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:19.800
you could start rejuvenating entire organs

01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:22.800
and in turn rejuvenating entire organ systems.

01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:27.160
So yeah, and actually the target,

01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:29.520
the target that I'm most interested in

01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:32.960
is actually the circulatory system, right?

01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:34.080
Like your cardiovascular

01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:36.200
and then your musculatory organ system.

01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:37.720
So it's really two,

01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:39.600
and you really have to use it in combination

01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:43.040
with other therapies because at the end of the day,

01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:45.200
like someone was alluding to,

01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:48.040
you have some hardware,

01:38:48.040 --> 01:38:49.880
you have some hardware, whatever it is,

01:38:49.880 --> 01:38:53.720
but how do the electrical signals detect?

01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:57.200
How do you actually target specific things?

01:38:57.200 --> 01:39:00.760
And it turns out that certain proteins in the body

01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:04.360
can actually be like,

01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:06.840
think about like within like photosynthesis, for example,

01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:08.920
there's certain proteins and plants

01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:13.200
that are using light to do some kind of chemical reaction.

01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:15.640
And it turns out in the body, they're the similar thing.

01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:19.080
So you essentially have to use like a combination

01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:25.240
of peptides and other things with these frequencies

01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:28.400
to be able to actually rejuvenate entire organ.

01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:32.920
But that would be the approach that I would suggest.

01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:33.760
Very good.

01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:36.040
John Kramer had a question.

01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:39.600
Yeah, it seems to me that the problem

01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:43.560
of applying this to aging is that really you need a map

01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:47.760
to decide which ion channels need to be open and closed

01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:50.000
in order to produce given effects.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:54.360
There may be, if we're lucky, there may be an ion channel

01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:56.680
that you can open that sort of causes the whole body

01:39:56.680 --> 01:40:00.120
to go into an anti-age or age reversal situation.

01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:03.320
So this really needs to be studied in great detail.

01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:06.040
And I'm pleased to hear from what he said

01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:09.440
that there are a large number of drugs

01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:10.560
that are now being developed,

01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:12.560
which have effects on ion channels.

01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:16.560
And so one needs to sort of cross correlate those drugs

01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:18.520
with the effects that they have in order to find out

01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:20.200
what's going on in mammals.

01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:24.480
And apparently, plenaria are fine,

01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:27.840
but they bear very little resemblance to us.

01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:31.720
And so we really need a lot of experimentation,

01:40:31.720 --> 01:40:35.520
apparently, investigation of what ion channels

01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:37.280
do what in mammals.

01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:38.680
And if we can do that,

01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:42.760
we might make real progress towards dealing with aging.

01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:44.600
Excellent.

01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:48.680
Does anyone here not know how to raise your hand

01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:51.240
with the little reactions?

01:40:51.240 --> 01:40:54.040
I'm just trying to figure that out.

01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:56.840
Okay, on the bottom,

01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:04.200
if you move your cursor to the bottom of your Zoom screen,

01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:06.840
it may be up already, it may pop up,

01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:11.840
but you will see mute, stop video, some other things.

01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:14.040
Now, farther to the right,

01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:18.160
to the right of the green share screen is reactions.

01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:23.160
If you hover over that, there is a raise hand.

01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:27.560
That puts you to the front on my screen.

01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:33.360
And okay, well.

01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:34.440
You're not finding it.

01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:37.120
Yeah, let's do this.

01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:39.760
Miles had a question, then you.

01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:42.600
And does anyone else not know how to do that?

01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:43.760
There you go.

01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:45.320
There you go.

01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:46.880
Okay.

01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:48.440
All right, I didn't hear that.

01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:52.120
So just so we can take everyone in order

01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:55.320
and everyone gets a turn, let's do it that way.

01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:57.360
Miles, please.

01:41:57.360 --> 01:41:58.240
Thank you.

01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:03.240
Just to answer, John, John Cramer, the OSKM,

01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:08.880
the Yamanaka Factors, they are combinatorial.

01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:10.800
And if you remember the experiments,

01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:13.360
Professor Yamanaka and all these collaborators

01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:17.800
tried many combinations until they eat the right combination

01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:22.240
which was extremely, it was an extreme reaction

01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:25.240
from the embryo, the animal,

01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:27.640
because it went right back to the embryonic state,

01:42:27.640 --> 01:42:29.160
which was, this is radical.

01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:31.960
I mean, normally, normal animals just don't do this.

01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:35.200
So it was a needle in a stack,

01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:38.760
and it was not easy there to try many, many combinations.

01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:41.400
And I think the same thing is gonna happen here.

01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:43.360
Something similar, you mentioned

01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:45.280
that he's got a cocktail already.

01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:47.520
I think that cocktail is fairly complex.

01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:50.880
And as you get to higher up mammals and so forth,

01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:54.880
I think that cocktail is more complex than for the worms.

01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:57.920
So that's my comment on your comment.

01:42:57.920 --> 01:43:01.480
The other one, Fiona, I also studied electrical engineering

01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:02.760
and also chemical engineering,

01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:04.920
the masters in chemical engineering.

01:43:04.920 --> 01:43:08.680
What I think, I discovered

01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:10.640
because I switched to chemical engineering,

01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:14.680
I found our whole host of what you would call design motifs.

01:43:14.680 --> 01:43:16.280
And I also call it design motifs.

01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:18.920
I mean, you're familiar with, say, a transistor,

01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:20.360
but as an electrical engineer,

01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:23.040
you are not normally familiar

01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:26.040
with a stranger tractor inside the embryo.

01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:28.720
You're not familiar with the reaction diffusion equation

01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:31.040
which determines that shape.

01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:34.080
You're not familiar with the sort of other fields

01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:36.480
which have different engineering motifs,

01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:37.800
different designs.

01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:40.640
What Dr. Levine did,

01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:43.280
I think what you have to think about it in this way,

01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:46.760
living organisms are not, they're very Catholic,

01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:48.240
they use everything.

01:43:48.240 --> 01:43:51.560
What he did, they combine electrical with chemical,

01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:55.600
with mechanical in a very unorthodox way.

01:43:55.600 --> 01:43:56.920
But what Dr. Levine did,

01:43:56.920 --> 01:43:59.800
he took the electrical system by itself

01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:02.200
and discovered that that's a control system,

01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:04.880
which is, I think, very, very, very impressive.

01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:07.640
The chemical system is still very complex

01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:11.400
and a lot of it does not have electrical analogs.

01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:12.840
There are things that happen in biology

01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:17.840
which just don't translate into electrical motifs,

01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:22.520
but at least the electrical control system

01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:25.520
is now in view, like he's manipulating it.

01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:28.960
He's not manipulating it with external fields,

01:44:28.960 --> 01:44:31.200
he's actually using chemistry to manipulate it,

01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:32.680
but it's still, because you can measure it,

01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:36.200
he's got a voltage-sensitive dye.

01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:38.240
So he's actually measuring the electrical fields

01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:39.520
and he can see, for example, like you said,

01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:41.160
he can see the face of the embryo

01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:43.360
before the embryo forms the face.

01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:45.840
So I think there's a lot of stuff around there

01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:48.040
which is not electrical, it's very confusing sometimes.

01:44:48.040 --> 01:44:50.840
I was like that, I still am a lot, a lot of times,

01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:53.960
but at least we've taken the electrical system out

01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:56.120
and we found that it's a control system.

01:44:56.120 --> 01:44:56.960
Thank you.

01:44:56.960 --> 01:44:59.800
Yeah, well, I know what you're saying.

01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:02.000
It's enormously interesting

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:05.200
and I just don't wanna oversimplify it.

01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:07.000
I don't think we fully understand,

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.640
and Michael would agree, and I talked to him before,

01:45:10.680 --> 01:45:14.320
he doesn't fully understand and he will not claim to.

01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:17.840
I mean, we're poking at things in the dark

01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:22.320
and try and learn as a black box what we're doing here.

01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:24.840
And I would also not, I mean,

01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:29.040
I'm gonna paste a link here for a video on replication

01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:30.640
and the whole thing that goes on.

01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:33.800
It is completely mind-blowing too.

01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:38.440
And there's very complex, very long,

01:45:38.440 --> 01:45:42.120
intelligent state machines and subroutines

01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:43.520
that you will see there.

01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:46.320
And this is all new, a lot of it is new research.

01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:50.720
When I took biochemistry even three years ago,

01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:54.440
some of this stuff was not yet known, like histones.

01:45:54.440 --> 01:45:57.200
I mean, a lot of it is recent.

01:45:57.200 --> 01:45:58.680
And it's just mind-boggling.

01:45:58.680 --> 01:46:01.600
And I just don't wanna say, well, this is hardware

01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:05.280
because it has intelligence of its own.

01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:10.040
And it is isolated to a cell, right?

01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:14.160
So in a way, you could say there's a hierarchy

01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:17.200
in what Michael is thinking is that

01:46:17.200 --> 01:46:19.760
you can control not at the cell level,

01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:22.920
you don't wanna be controlling at the genetic level.

01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:26.840
And there's something very powerful there.

01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:32.680
But I just don't think we can oversimplify it that way.

01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:38.160
Well, there's a lot to figure out,

01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:39.920
we need more time to do it.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:42.840
Jeff?

01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:49.160
Well, Dr. Levin seems to have really opened up

01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:52.400
a whole new field of endeavor,

01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:56.120
just scratching the surface.

01:46:56.120 --> 01:46:58.680
You can look at all kinds of applications

01:46:58.680 --> 01:47:02.520
to repair the damage of organs

01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:07.160
and systems that occur during aging.

01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:11.160
But ultimately, it seems like that approaches,

01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:13.480
becomes the game of whack-a-mole,

01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:17.400
where as you age, more and more things go wrong

01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:20.160
and you can be repairing until that's all you're doing

01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:22.120
is repairing this and that.

01:47:22.120 --> 01:47:26.200
But because we are fundamentally programmed to age,

01:47:26.200 --> 01:47:29.760
but yet there might be an opportunity with this technology

01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:31.600
to change that program.

01:47:31.600 --> 01:47:33.920
We keep coming back to this computer analogy,

01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:36.960
but I think it is a good analogy

01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:40.320
that this technology could possibly

01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:43.200
just change the entire program where we do not,

01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:46.400
you change the software so we do not age.

01:47:52.760 --> 01:47:56.560
Well, let's work on it, let's do it.

01:47:56.560 --> 01:47:59.240
That's the moonshot, as you would say.

01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:02.480
Well, yeah, I think.

01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:05.280
Yeah, I've got something to talk about.

01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:06.880
You'll hear about it in a later meeting,

01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:11.320
but let's see, Miles, you had another question.

01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:13.880
Yeah, no, no, no, I just wanted to say,

01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:15.520
yes, I agree with Jeff,

01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:17.480
but I do believe in this combinational,

01:48:17.480 --> 01:48:20.120
they're gonna search for the right combination.

01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:22.080
And you're gonna see the same radical change

01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:24.080
that you saw with the Amunaka factors,

01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:26.280
which is completely unnatural.

01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:27.960
So I expect that, Jeff.

01:48:29.480 --> 01:48:32.200
The other question I want to make is just

01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:33.640
that he's not alone anymore.

01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:35.880
There's a big program at Harvard University.

01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:37.640
You know, the nuclear program,

01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:41.800
the venture capitalist are doing a big program

01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:45.680
on bioelectricity, on bioelectric control,

01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:47.840
as a response to his discovery.

01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:51.240
So it's not as isolated as what we think.

01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:54.880
There's actually money now going into this technology

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:56.840
as we speak.

01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:02.200
Yeah, I was just gonna comment.

01:49:02.200 --> 01:49:03.560
I agree with what you said, Miles.

01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:06.280
It's a broad area of research

01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:09.120
and commenting on your comment too, Jeff.

01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:14.120
I think you're thinking about it sort of the right way

01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:15.760
to some degree,

01:49:15.760 --> 01:49:18.240
but with a slightly different flavor.

01:49:18.240 --> 01:49:20.560
So it's not that we wouldn't age at all.

01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:23.560
It's just we would have various tools

01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:28.400
to enhance our resilience to effectively slow down

01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:31.840
the aging process very dramatically,

01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:36.840
while also augmenting ourselves to be much more resilient.

01:49:36.920 --> 01:49:40.880
And then in turn, actually reversing damage.

01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:42.360
Like it's slightly different.

01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:45.080
Like you think about like the sense, you know,

01:49:45.080 --> 01:49:47.880
Aubury degree, they always talk about like this damage,

01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:51.840
but it's really like the repair mechanisms

01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:53.520
that are not functioning correctly

01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:56.960
or like the rejuvenation functions

01:49:56.960 --> 01:49:58.480
that aren't resilient enough.

01:49:58.480 --> 01:50:02.560
So I think we can augment those through these tools

01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:04.760
would be kind of the way I was thinking of it.

01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:07.840
And another short comment, you know,

01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:09.240
I was thinking about what Fiona was saying

01:50:09.240 --> 01:50:12.280
and I looked at that video and I tend to agree

01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:15.520
there's so much complexity in the body.

01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:19.200
But I think using like approach that Dr. Levin's using

01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:21.040
sort of like a top down, you know,

01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:24.840
if we can target specific organs and we can see,

01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:27.560
I mean, the way he targeted like an arm to regrow

01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:29.960
in some of these sample organisms, you know,

01:50:29.960 --> 01:50:33.760
we may not understand some of the underlying biology

01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:36.080
on the cellular level or even in the cells

01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:38.440
and maybe still remain a mystery

01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:41.140
even after we can rejuvenate entire organs.

01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:44.520
You know, so I don't think we'll have to understand

01:50:44.520 --> 01:50:46.560
like every single component

01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:49.120
or even like the complete map I was describing,

01:50:49.120 --> 01:50:52.160
I don't think we would have, at least not for a long time,

01:50:52.160 --> 01:50:54.200
you know, okay, you have this frequency

01:50:54.200 --> 01:50:55.720
or this electrical signal,

01:50:55.720 --> 01:50:57.960
what does it do to each individual cell type?

01:50:57.960 --> 01:51:00.520
Which, you know, we have thousands of cell types.

01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:03.520
So that would be a much harder problem too.

01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:04.520
Just a few thoughts.

01:51:04.520 --> 01:51:09.520
We don't have to understand everything to work with it.

01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:18.560
It's like we may not understand how we breathe completely,

01:51:18.560 --> 01:51:20.600
but we breathe and we function.

01:51:20.600 --> 01:51:24.480
So in that way, I'm a complete supporter of,

01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:27.560
let's use that tool and all the other tools.

01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:32.320
I agree, yeah, we have to understand it enough

01:51:33.160 --> 01:51:36.640
to like alter it, for sure, I definitely agree.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:38.840
I'll take it.

01:51:38.840 --> 01:51:42.000
If there is a way you could, even if you don't understand,

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:46.320
you could do a pattern, a bioelectric pattern

01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:49.720
and tell the body to go backwards and rejuvenate,

01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:51.840
that's cool, right?

01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:54.680
It's a little bit of a, well,

01:51:55.960 --> 01:51:59.200
we can certainly keep learning that dimension.

01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:01.800
Yeah, it's a star shot for sure, as Johnny would say.

01:52:03.320 --> 01:52:04.160
Thank you.

01:52:08.960 --> 01:52:11.760
Well, it's been a couple of hours.

01:52:12.680 --> 01:52:16.280
This has been most rewarding.

01:52:16.280 --> 01:52:18.480
As quickly as possible,

01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:21.320
I'll get the recording up on the YouTube channel.

01:52:21.320 --> 01:52:25.040
I don't know about you, but I'm gonna watch it a number

01:52:25.040 --> 01:52:27.760
of times for all this to really sink in

01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:30.360
and then take it to the next level.

01:52:30.360 --> 01:52:32.680
How will we use this to solve aging?

01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:35.160
And then, oh, little questions like,

01:52:35.160 --> 01:52:40.000
how will we raise the money to use this to save aging?

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:43.480
And I have something I'm gonna reveal soon.

01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:46.680
You will probably be among the first to see it.

01:52:47.640 --> 01:52:52.640
So if you are going to the foresight frontiers

01:52:54.120 --> 01:52:56.880
in longevity science, I think that's the name

01:52:56.880 --> 01:52:59.280
of the conference in San Francisco.

01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:04.840
I know, I believe Fiona, you'll be there.

01:53:04.840 --> 01:53:08.480
It's April 17th and 18th.

01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:13.480
You can't really get in now unless you become a sponsor,

01:53:13.920 --> 01:53:17.520
but yeah, that's gonna be world-class.

01:53:17.520 --> 01:53:19.520
So I'll look forward to seeing you there.

01:53:22.240 --> 01:53:26.040
So unless there's any final, Jeff, final comments?

01:53:27.880 --> 01:53:31.040
If people are interested in learning more

01:53:31.040 --> 01:53:36.040
about Dr. Levin's work, of course, reading all of his papers,

01:53:36.560 --> 01:53:40.840
but there are a number of much longer interviews on YouTube

01:53:40.840 --> 01:53:43.840
than he, and he doesn't just give the same canned speech

01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:45.040
over and over again.

01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:48.080
He covers a lot of different ground

01:53:48.080 --> 01:53:51.000
in his interviews that he gives.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:54.760
So there's some other good videos to watch

01:53:54.880 --> 01:53:56.680
if you want to see more of him.

01:53:58.640 --> 01:54:00.240
You can search for him on YouTube.

01:54:02.200 --> 01:54:05.040
So this was an outstanding thank you, Johnny,

01:54:05.040 --> 01:54:06.480
for organizing this conference.

01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:07.800
No, no, no, Miles.

01:54:07.800 --> 01:54:09.120
It was fascinating.

01:54:09.120 --> 01:54:11.240
I mean, I was at the edge of my seat.

01:54:11.240 --> 01:54:12.520
Miles, thank you.

01:54:12.520 --> 01:54:13.360
Thanks, Miles.

01:54:13.360 --> 01:54:14.200
Very good.

01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:16.440
Thank you, everyone.

01:54:16.440 --> 01:54:17.280
Appreciate it, Miles.

01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:18.120
Thanks, people.

01:54:18.120 --> 01:54:19.720
Sorry for the date.

01:54:19.720 --> 01:54:22.200
He's not available on Saturdays.

01:54:23.200 --> 01:54:26.000
Me and Johnny had a lot of back and forth

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.560
trying to get him on a Saturday, but me.

01:54:29.560 --> 01:54:30.400
It's so hard.

01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:31.240
It's so hard.

01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:33.120
It's breaking the schedule for that.

01:54:33.120 --> 01:54:33.960
Sure, yeah.

01:54:33.960 --> 01:54:34.800
Thank you very much.

01:54:34.800 --> 01:54:35.640
Thank you very much.

01:54:35.640 --> 01:54:36.480
Much worth it.

01:54:37.560 --> 01:54:38.960
Okay, thanks, everyone.

01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:41.160
This has been a great morning.

01:54:41.160 --> 01:54:44.240
We're all off to a great Friday and a great weekend.

01:54:44.240 --> 01:54:45.400
So thank you.

01:54:45.400 --> 01:54:46.680
See you next time.
