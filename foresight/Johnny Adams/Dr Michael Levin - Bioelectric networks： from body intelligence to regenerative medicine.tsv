0	4240	Welcome to our gerontology research group online meeting.
4240	8360	Today is Friday, March 24th, 2023.
8360	11640	And special thanks to Miles Jacobs,
11640	13880	who manages our meetings.
13880	16360	I'm kind of busy solving the problems
16360	19040	of biological aging these days.
19040	20960	And without Miles,
20960	23900	we probably wouldn't have as many of these meetings
23900	27680	and they definitely would not be as high quality
27720	29520	as the one we're gonna have today.
30680	35040	Today we have an extraordinary innovative speaker,
35040	36920	Dr. Michael Levin.
36920	40360	And Dr. Levin is distinguished professor
40360	42480	and Vannevar Bush chair,
42480	44920	biology department at Tufts,
44920	49520	and director of the Allen Discovery Center at Tufts.
49520	54520	He's also associate faculty at Harvard's Dease Institute.
54520	59520	In his lab, he studies basic questions of information
60320	62520	processing and biology,
62520	66640	and drives applications in regenerative medicine
66640	69600	and synthetic bioengineering.
72320	73720	It must have been 20 years ago,
73720	77240	I read a book, The Body Electric by Becker,
77240	80160	and I was just amazed at the opportunity.
80160	83760	And now I believe Dr. Levin
83760	86640	is going to bring some of that to life for you.
86640	90880	So I will hand the floor over to Dr. Michael Levin.
93240	95000	Well, thank you so much for the invitation
95000	97720	and thank you for the opportunity to talk to you all
97720	98920	and share some ideas.
98920	102640	I am not directly working in the field of aging,
102640	105160	but I think we have some thoughts
105160	108440	that are possibly useful for that set of questions.
108440	110240	And so if anybody's interested,
110240	113040	this is the website where you can find all the primary papers,
113040	116320	the software, the data sets, and everything else.
116320	118000	So I'm going to talk about today
118000	120360	is an approach towards what I call
120360	122200	a definitive regenerative medicine.
122200	123680	I will explain what I mean.
123680	126120	And in my view,
126120	129560	the road to this definitive regenerative medicine
129560	132480	contains large components of understanding
132480	135280	natural bioelectrical signaling between cells,
135280	137600	specifically not just as a physical mechanism,
137600	139440	but actually as the medium
139440	142640	for the collective intelligence of groups of cells.
142640	145520	So what I mean by a definitive regenerative medicine
145520	150040	is breaking the unsustainable feedback loop
150040	153920	or cycle between this scheme
153920	157840	where we try these interventions late in life.
157840	162840	And to whatever extent we can push forward the lifespan,
163520	164880	the next set of interventions
164880	166480	has to be increasingly more heroic
166480	168040	because what you're basically dealing with
168040	170640	is a continuously sinking ship.
170640	174960	And this is unacceptable for us as patients.
174960	177040	It's unsupportable for any society
177040	179600	because it exponentially increases the cost
179600	182320	of each further intervention that has to be done.
182320	185240	So something radical has to break this cycle.
185240	187440	And if we think about it,
187440	189600	all of the problems of medicine
189600	191680	with the exception of infectious disease.
191680	194160	So we're talking about birth defects, traumatic injuries,
194160	196920	cancer, aging, degenerative disease, all of this
196920	198920	have one important thing in common.
198920	202200	They are all problems of information processing
202200	203560	in the following sense.
203560	208040	If we could control what it is that groups of cells build,
208040	209880	that is if we could convince groups of cells
209880	212800	to build particular complex anatomical structures,
212800	214400	all of these problems would go away.
214400	217680	We could continuously rebuild structures of the body
217680	220840	to maintain health span, repair injuries,
220840	222440	reprogram cancer.
222440	225880	All of these things would be resolved
225880	228240	if we understood how to get cells
228240	230960	to build particular anatomical structures.
230960	235960	And so the kind of end game of this whole field,
236480	239960	I call something that can be termed
239960	241920	as the anatomical compiler.
241920	244160	The idea is that someday in the future,
244160	246120	we will be able to sit down in front of a computer
246120	250440	and draw in terms of the anatomy that you want
250440	252080	your plant or animal to have.
252080	253840	So not molecular pathways,
253840	256480	not the underlying biochemical details,
256480	257680	but what you actually care about,
257680	260040	which is the form and function.
260040	262760	So you will draw this some sort of anatomical structure
262760	264560	like this three-headed flatworm.
264560	266440	And if we knew what we were doing,
266440	268960	the anatomical compiler would convert
268960	272320	that anatomical descriptor into a set of stimuli
272320	274760	that would get cells to build exactly that.
274760	275600	So what we're talking about
275600	277600	is complete control over growth and form.
277600	280480	This is the radical solution that we need.
280480	284440	Now note that this kind of thing is not a 3D printer.
284440	287160	The point is not to micromanage
287160	288760	where every single cell goes.
288760	290160	It's a communications device.
290160	291800	And we'll get back to this concept
291800	293760	towards the end of the talk.
293760	298160	So having focused in on this idea
298160	303160	that it is the cooperative action of collectives of cells
303920	305240	that build our various organs,
305240	307120	either healthy organs or not,
307120	309200	we can then ask this very simple question.
309200	312520	Where does the body anatomy come from in the first place?
312520	314560	So this is a cross-section of a human torso.
314560	318600	You see all the amazing structures that are here, right?
318600	321400	Everything is the correct size, shape relative to
321400	325160	the things next to it and the correct orientation.
325160	327600	So where is this structure set?
327600	329880	Where is this order specified?
329880	334160	And lots of people are kind of intuitively will say,
334160	336600	well, it's the genome, it's in the DNA.
336600	338320	But if we look closer at that claim,
338600	340640	we now understand we can sequence genomes.
340640	341680	Now we know what's in the DNA.
341680	343440	The DNA doesn't say anything directly
343440	345360	about large-scale anatomical parameters.
345360	347720	What the DNA specifies is proteins.
347720	350680	It specifies the micro-level hardware
350680	352920	that each individual cell gets to have.
352920	354520	And so what we still need to understand
354520	359040	is how the actual collective activity of these cells
359040	362120	with the hardware that they have from their genome
362120	364760	works together to build the right thing.
364760	367120	That is a species-specific target morphology.
367120	369600	How do these cells know when to stop?
369600	372000	Why do cells sometimes defect from this plan
372000	373320	and form cancer?
373320	375800	We'll talk a little bit about that.
375800	378320	How would we induce, if a part of this is missing or damaged,
378320	380840	how would we induce these cells to rebuild,
380840	382320	damage their aging structures?
382320	385320	And as engineers, how far can we push this process?
385320	386720	What else can these cells build
386720	389720	besides their normal default target morphology?
389720	393480	And so I want to kind of start off by thinking about
393480	397520	what's necessary to understand this process.
397520	400120	And we've had great advances in genomics
400120	403200	and molecular biology and big data and genetics and so on.
403200	404720	And so you might think that,
404720	406240	well, this should be solved already.
406240	409520	Why do we not have this anatomical compiler?
409520	411160	And I just want to be very clear
411160	415640	that very, very fundamental things are still impossible
415640	418920	from the perspective of genetics and molecular biology.
418920	420400	So this is just one example.
420400	422000	So here's a baby axolotl.
422040	423960	It's a little salamander.
423960	425760	Baby axolotls have four legs.
425760	428960	This is a frog larva or a tadpole,
428960	430840	which do not have legs.
430840	433560	And in my lab, what we can do is we can make frog allotls,
433560	435680	which is an embryo that's part salamander cells,
435680	436840	part frog cells.
436840	439760	Now, I pose a simple question.
440680	443200	Will frog allotls have legs or won't they?
443200	445240	Now, we've got the genome for the axolotl.
445240	446080	It's been sequenced.
446080	447280	We've got the genome for the frog.
447280	448840	It's been sequenced.
448840	450720	Can anybody tell me whether frog allotls
450720	452080	are going to have legs or not?
452080	452920	And the answer is no.
452920	456560	We have no idea or even more subtle questions like,
456560	457400	if they do have legs,
457400	460040	are they going to be made entirely of the axolotl cells
460040	462240	or are they in fact going to induce
462240	464000	some of the frog cells to participate?
464000	466480	And that's because this kind of question
466480	467920	is not a question that could be answered
467920	468960	at the level of the hardware.
468960	471200	This is a collective intelligence question.
471200	474800	What are these complex agents going to build?
474800	476800	And we are still not very good at understanding
476800	478880	the rules of that kind of process.
478880	482920	So where we are really is that molecular medicine
482920	485200	is very good at understanding
485200	486800	which genes and proteins interact
486800	488200	with which other genes and proteins.
488200	490680	And so we can build nice models like this.
490680	492680	But we are really quite a long way away
492680	495360	from the control of large scale structure and function.
495360	498120	If you wanted to make rational changes at the system level,
498120	501120	it is very hard to know what to do back here.
501120	504720	And so I think where molecular medicine is today
504720	508480	is roughly where computer science was in the 40s and 50s.
509480	511160	If you wanted to program a computer,
511160	513040	you had to interact with the hardware.
513040	515000	You had to directly rewire it physically.
515000	517960	You were always down at that hardware level.
517960	519520	And this is where we are today.
519520	524520	So all of the most exciting parts of molecular medicine,
524880	528240	so genome editing, CRISPR, protein engineering,
528240	530200	pathway rewiring, all of these things
530200	532760	are really down at the biological hardware level.
532760	535320	We haven't even really begun to take advantage
535320	538840	of what computer science has done
538840	541760	to give us the information technology revolution,
541760	544040	which is to figure out that actually,
544040	545520	if your hardware is good enough,
545520	547280	and I'm going to argue that biological hardware
547280	548640	is definitely good enough,
548640	551520	then what you can do is you can communicate with it
551520	553560	via a high level interface.
553560	556080	You don't have to, this is the reason why
556080	558880	when you want to change from PowerPoint
558880	560440	to Zoom on your laptop,
560440	562760	you don't get out your soldering iron and start rewiring.
562760	564960	It's because we have this nice interface
565000	568520	that allows you access to some of the computational capacities
568520	570520	of the system that are reprogrammable.
570520	574200	In other words, could we take advantage
574200	578280	of a higher level of information processing specifically,
578280	580160	and I'm going to define this word in a minute,
580160	583520	specifically the intelligence of the software of life.
583520	584720	And the thing about biology,
584720	586560	which is actually not captured today
586560	588760	in any of our computational devices
588760	590720	or robotics or anything like that,
590720	594400	is this amazing multi-scale competency architecture
594400	596840	where we're not just a nested doll,
596840	598440	set of nested dolls structurally,
598440	600920	where you've got molecular networks and cells
600920	603320	and tissues and organs and swarms and so on.
603320	606120	But actually, each one of these layers has competencies
606120	609120	that solve specific problems in its own space.
609120	611840	So we have a problem solving in physiological space,
611840	613120	in transcriptional space,
613120	614840	meaning the space of gene expression,
614840	617120	in anatomical morphous space,
617120	619440	and of course, in familiar 3D behavioral space
619440	621320	in the case of whole organisms.
622240	624840	And so we could spend hours talking
624840	626520	about all these different examples,
626520	628080	but I just want to highlight a couple of things
628080	629560	and then spend most of my time
629560	632920	talking about the morphogenetic problem solving.
632920	634800	So just to give you an example
634800	637600	of some of the amazing plasticity of life,
637600	639360	this is what we've done here is we've made a tadpole.
639360	641320	So here's the mouth, here are the nostrils,
641320	642920	the brain, the gut, the tail,
642920	644640	in which you'll notice something very strange
644640	645480	about this tadpole.
645480	647680	There aren't any eyes where the eye should be.
647680	650440	What we've done is we've placed some eye cells on its tail.
650440	654720	Now these cells, they have no problem forming a perfect eye,
654720	656080	even though they're sitting next to muscle
656080	657440	instead of next to the brain.
657440	660120	They then put out a single optic nerve, which crawls out.
660120	662800	It synapses on the spinal cord right here, then it stops,
662800	663960	it does not go to the brain,
663960	666400	it sort of ends on the spinal cord.
666400	668880	And these animals, as we found from building a machine
668880	671800	that automates the training and testing
671800	673760	of these guys on visual cues,
673760	675200	these animals can see quite well.
675200	677360	They see perfectly well out of this eye.
677360	679320	And so what you see here is this amazing plasticity
679320	681680	where this brain that expected visual input
681680	683880	from these two locations for millions of years,
683880	685320	this is the architecture.
685320	688480	In one generation, no adaptation,
688480	690520	specific adaptation needed,
690520	693360	the fact that the sensory motor architecture
693360	695000	is now completely different, no problem.
695000	696720	They're able to incorporate that
696720	698600	into their behavioral repertoire.
698600	703600	So it's clear that there are these interesting capabilities
705960	709280	of these kinds of biological systems to adapt to novel.
709320	711480	Circumstances, and this is what we're going to hijack.
711480	713640	These are the kinds of things we're going to hijack
713640	718440	for a kind of a really, really radical regenerative medicine.
718440	720520	What I wanna spend some time on now
720520	724080	is to introduce you to this little critter,
724080	725520	which I think in many ways,
725520	727200	this model system has the answer
727200	729320	to many of the big questions of life,
729320	730880	not only medicine, but beyond.
730880	732800	This is a planarian flatworm.
732800	735560	So these are not simple organisms like earthworms.
735560	737840	These are similar to our direct ancestor.
737840	739600	They have true bilateral symmetry.
739600	741400	They have a true centralized brain.
741400	743520	They have lots of organs, lots of different cell types,
743520	746320	all the same neurotransmitters that you and I have.
746320	748480	And they have a number of amazing properties.
748480	750680	The first is regeneration.
750680	752400	So you can cut them into pieces.
752400	755640	The record is something like 275 pieces.
755640	756920	It doesn't matter how you cut them,
756920	757920	what the plane of section is,
757920	759360	you can cut them any way you want.
759360	761360	Each piece regenerates a perfect worm.
761360	762760	It grows exactly what's needed,
762760	766640	no more or less gives you a perfect, perfect worm.
766640	768080	They're very cancer resistant.
768080	769320	It's not that they can't get cancer,
769320	773040	but they're extremely resistant and they're immortal.
773040	774280	This is maybe the part
774280	776320	that's the most interesting to all of you.
776320	778760	There is no such thing as an old planarian.
778760	781120	The individual cells senesce and drop off,
781120	782360	but they get regenerated.
782360	786360	This animal regenerates continuously.
786360	790640	And so the animals that are in my lab now
790640	793440	are in direct physical continuity to worms
793440	795160	that were here half a billion years ago.
795160	796960	These are literally them.
796960	799120	They just sort of continue.
799120	800680	And they're smart.
800680	801520	You can train them.
801520	803040	I'll talk about that momentarily.
803040	804840	And they've got this interesting property.
804840	808400	So they've got an incredibly messy genome.
808400	809240	Why?
809240	811440	Because most of us reproduce sexually,
811440	813240	which means that when you reproduce,
813240	815920	your children do not inherit the somatic mutations
815920	818400	that happened in your body during your lifetime.
818400	820680	But in planaria, the way they typically reproduce
820680	823280	is they tear themselves in half and then regenerate.
823280	826160	So any mutation that doesn't kill the stem cell
826160	829000	in which it occurs basically gets propagated
829000	831120	through the body in the subsequent generation.
831120	833480	They hold on to, this is called somatic inheritance.
833480	835240	They've hold on to all of these mutations.
835240	839400	They don't clean them up the way that the rest of us do.
839400	842040	And so their genome is a complete mess.
842040	843960	They can be mix-a-ploid, meaning every cell
843960	845760	has a different number of chromosomes.
846640	850720	They look, it actually looks a lot like what we would say
850720	851880	of a tumor genome.
851920	855920	And yet it has all of these properties.
855920	858400	Now, this is really strange.
858400	861920	In no course of cell developmental biology,
861920	865200	genetics and so on, does anybody give you a theory
865200	867960	that would predict why the animal with the messiest genome
867960	869840	would actually be the most regenerative,
869840	872160	cancer-resistant and immortal?
872160	877160	Because what we're told instead is that the genome
877280	880880	and your genotype is actually a critical determinant
880880	882080	of all your capacities.
882080	883400	This goes exactly backwards.
883400	885240	Why would the animal with the worst genome
885240	887240	have all these amazing properties?
887240	889240	Now, they have one more interesting property
889240	892920	which is interesting for aging, which is this.
892920	894200	They're smart, you can train them.
894200	898000	And so if you make little bumps like this
898000	900360	on the laser edge, little bumps on the surface
900360	902680	and you feed them with liver on this region.
902680	905000	And so they remember that this is sort of a safe place
905000	906200	where they can eat.
906200	908080	Then you can cut off their heads
908080	910320	and the tail will sit there for a week and a half
910320	911480	doing nothing.
911480	914200	They will then regenerate eventually a brain,
914200	915440	the head with the entire brain.
915440	917080	And then you will find out that these animals
917080	919120	still remember the original training.
919120	920520	So what you see in this model system,
920520	923560	you can actually look at the distribution of memory
923560	925920	in the rest of the body, meaning outside the brain.
925920	928680	And most importantly, the imprinting of that information
928680	931160	onto a new brain as it develops.
931160	935360	Besides kind of a fundamental philosophical implications,
935360	940080	what the medical kind of impact of this
940120	943400	is that in the future, when we have regenerative therapies
943400	947360	that replace cells in a human patient's brain,
947360	950760	which may have six or seven decades of memories
950760	954560	and personality and so on with progeny of naive new cells,
954560	956440	the question is what happens to the personality
956440	957280	of that patient?
957280	960520	And these kind of models start to suggest
960520	963600	that actually there may be considerable hope
963600	967880	that these properties are actually spread farther
967880	970120	than one thinks and may actually be imprinted
970120	971520	onto the new tissue.
971520	973880	So let's think about how all this amazing plasticity works,
973880	976440	regeneration of body and of memories.
976440	977560	How does it work?
977560	981080	Well, the key is this, that all of us
981080	982560	used to be individual cells.
982560	985600	We all started life as an unfertilized oocyte,
985600	990040	a quiescent oocyte that's a little pile of biochemistry.
990040	991880	And through this process of development,
991880	993760	you become one of these creatures
993760	996280	or perhaps one like this.
996360	998640	This is Renee Descartes,
998640	1000680	who is going to have all kinds of opinions
1000680	1004640	about the living beings and machines and so on.
1004640	1007480	But notice that this process is completely continuous.
1007480	1010640	There is no magical flash during development
1010640	1012280	where you say this is the moment
1012280	1013960	where you went from being chemistry and physics
1013960	1016440	as a quiescent oocyte to a being
1016440	1019680	with metacognitive capacities and so on.
1019680	1023400	This is a slow and gradual developmental process.
1023400	1026200	And this is the sort of thing
1026200	1027040	that we're made of.
1027040	1028400	Now, this is a free living organism
1028400	1030160	known as a lacrimaria.
1030160	1032760	There's no brain, there's no nervous system, it's one cell.
1032760	1035360	And all of its problems are solved within a single cell.
1035360	1037720	So it's metabolic needs, it's physiological needs,
1037720	1040480	it's behavioral, morphological repertoire.
1040480	1043560	All of this is taken care of in one cell.
1043560	1047640	So while these individual cells solve little tiny
1047640	1051120	kind of goal states at the level of a single cell,
1051120	1054160	together they work towards very large scale
1054160	1056040	construction projects like this.
1056080	1058480	And that process, what we're going to do
1058480	1061320	is look at the involvement in that process
1061320	1063840	of something that I refer to as intelligence.
1063840	1065520	What do I mean by intelligence?
1065520	1067040	I mean what William James meant,
1067040	1069240	which is the ability to reach the same goal
1069240	1071120	by different means, that's it.
1071120	1072760	When I say intelligence, I do not mean
1072760	1074280	it has to do anything with brains.
1074280	1077160	I don't mean it has to be this kind of metacognitive,
1077160	1079480	I know how smart I am or I know what I know.
1079480	1083720	It just means the ability to deploy some level of competency
1083720	1086440	to reach the same goal state by different means
1086440	1088400	depending on what's happening in the environment.
1088400	1090440	So some level of ingenuity and problem solving.
1090440	1092440	So let's see some examples.
1094280	1096880	One thing we know about development is that it's very reliable.
1096880	1100800	So you start off as a single cell, the egg,
1100800	1103440	and then reliably this collection of cells
1103440	1105880	navigates that space of possible shapes
1105880	1108360	to reach that species specific morphology,
1108360	1109920	a normal organism.
1109920	1112880	But actually it's reliable, but it isn't hardwired.
1112880	1114640	Because if you come along halfway through
1114640	1119360	and split the embryo in half or in quarters,
1119360	1121680	you don't get two half bodies, as you would
1121680	1125120	with a typical device that we've made until now.
1125880	1127800	What instead you'll get is two perfectly normal
1127800	1129280	monosygotic twins.
1129280	1131760	In fact, this is a system that can reach this.
1131760	1135840	So here's the kind of abstract anatomical morpho space.
1135840	1138520	Here's the ensemble of states we recognize
1138520	1139880	as a normal human anatomy.
1139880	1140800	And you can actually get there
1140800	1144000	from multiple different starting positions,
1144000	1146000	even avoiding some local maxima,
1146000	1148480	because this is not a hardwired system.
1148480	1150520	Not only is regulative development like that,
1150520	1153800	but in some animals, they do that as adults.
1153800	1156920	So here's the saxolotl, the salamander
1156920	1160120	that can regenerate its limbs, its eyes, its jaws,
1160120	1162040	its spinal cord and tail,
1162040	1164920	ovaries, portions of the brain and heart.
1164920	1166680	And what it looks like is this,
1166680	1170880	if you amputate a leg anywhere along this distance,
1170880	1173200	what the cells will do is rapidly grow
1173200	1177280	and undergo morphogenesis to restore exactly what's needed,
1177280	1178600	and then they stop.
1178600	1180440	And it can do that from this position,
1180440	1184680	from any position, it makes only what's needed.
1184680	1186840	This is the most amazing part of regeneration,
1186840	1188280	is that it stops.
1188280	1189480	How does it know when to stop?
1189480	1191720	Well, it stops when a correct salamander arm
1191720	1193680	has been completed, that's when it stops.
1193680	1194960	So we need to start to understand,
1194960	1196480	how does it know where it's going
1196480	1197920	in this anatomical morpho space?
1197920	1200360	How, what are the policies guiding the navigation
1200360	1202640	in the space of these cells?
1202640	1204520	And how do they know when they've gotten there?
1204520	1208000	By the way, this isn't just for frogs and flatworms
1208000	1211960	and salamanders, humans have some of this
1211960	1214840	and mammals, some mammals have more.
1214840	1218000	Of course, the human liver is highly regenerative.
1218000	1220120	Deer, a large adult mammal,
1220120	1223760	regenerates up to a centimeter and a half of newborn per day
1223760	1225840	when they're regrowing their antlers.
1225840	1228920	And human children can regenerate their fingertips
1228920	1230280	below a certain age.
1230280	1231480	If you just keep the wound clean,
1231480	1235000	they will actually regrow a cosmetically normal fingertip.
1235000	1236880	So we have this critical question.
1236880	1239800	How does the collective decision-making of these cell
1239800	1242920	groups determine what they're supposed to be building,
1242920	1244200	when they're supposed to stop,
1244200	1246120	and actually, what are the failure modes?
1246120	1247760	Why doesn't it work in humans all the time?
1247760	1251000	Why are we not like axolotls or salamanders?
1251000	1252720	So we started to study this process
1253680	1255760	and in particular, starting to look at these questions
1255760	1259680	of how do collections of cells represent the goal states
1259680	1262800	that guide their construction projects?
1262800	1266080	And so we took our inspiration from the nervous system
1266080	1268360	because if you're trying to think of an example
1268360	1271720	of a collection of cells that can store large-scale
1271720	1274320	navigational set points in some kind of space
1274320	1276960	and then act to implement them and then stop when they're done,
1276960	1278760	of course, the nervous system is the best example
1278760	1280880	we have of that.
1280880	1283800	And so what allows it to do that is this,
1283800	1284800	the hardware looks like this.
1284800	1287960	You've got cells we call neurons.
1287960	1290360	They have these little ion channel proteins
1290360	1292880	in their cell membranes, which move ions around
1292880	1294680	and generate a voltage potential.
1295960	1300080	This may or may not be propagated to their neighbors
1300080	1302520	via electrical synapses known as gap junctions.
1302520	1306360	So that's that kind of excitable medium is the hardware.
1306360	1308720	And what it does is it underlies the software,
1308720	1311040	which is the physiology of electrical states
1311040	1312400	moving through the system.
1312400	1314680	This is a video which this group made
1314680	1319440	of the real-time electrical activity
1319440	1320800	in the zebrafish brain.
1320800	1322760	And it is the commitment of neuroscience
1322760	1326200	that all of the animal's cognitive capacity,
1326200	1328400	so all of the computation, all of the memories,
1328400	1331680	the goals, the preferences, the behavioral repertoires,
1331680	1335040	all of it is encoded in this electrical activity.
1335040	1337040	And so there's this process of neural decoding,
1337040	1339360	this idea that if we knew how,
1339360	1342520	we would be scanning these electrical states
1342520	1346680	and decoding them to really understand
1346680	1348760	what the animal is thinking, what it's seeing, and so on.
1348760	1350600	Actually, there's been some progress in this,
1350600	1354760	both in human patients and in mice and so on.
1354760	1357200	There's been some progress in this neural decoding.
1357200	1359800	But the really interesting aspect of this
1359800	1362320	is that this is not unique to the brain.
1362320	1364600	Every cell in your body has ion channels.
1364600	1367560	Most cells have these gap junctions to their neighbors.
1367560	1369320	And you can imagine a very parallel,
1369320	1372200	and this is what we've been doing for 25 years now,
1372200	1375000	you can imagine a very parallel process
1375000	1378280	where you take all of the tools and concepts of neuroscience
1378280	1380640	and you simply port them outside of the nervous system
1380640	1384600	and ask, okay, what are the computations
1384600	1386960	that the rest of the body cells are doing?
1386960	1390040	And might they underlie a kind of decision-making,
1390040	1391360	in particular the one we care about,
1391360	1394720	which is morphogenetic solution to morphogenetic problems,
1394720	1397440	injury, aging, cancer, and so on.
1397440	1400800	So what we have here is a really clean isomorphism
1400800	1403280	where what the nervous system does
1403280	1406600	is use the electrophysiological software
1406600	1411480	to make decisions and those decisions result
1411480	1413440	in signals being given to your muscles,
1413440	1416120	which move you through three-dimensional space.
1416120	1418480	But this amazing system didn't evolve out of nowhere.
1418480	1420280	What actually happened was that it specialized
1420280	1425200	a far more ancient evolutionary basal bioelectric system,
1425200	1428200	which works in a very similar way.
1428200	1431960	It was here long before nerves and muscles evolved.
1431960	1434400	What it does is exactly the same thing,
1434400	1436080	networks of electrically active cells
1436080	1437880	produce bioelectrical signals
1437880	1440080	that control all of your body cells,
1440080	1441960	but they don't move you through three-dimensional space,
1441960	1443400	they move your body configuration
1443400	1445400	through anatomical morpho space.
1445400	1447240	This is the system that evolution pivoted
1447240	1448960	into the control of behavior
1448960	1453840	when it was speed optimized for nerve and muscle.
1453840	1455800	And so you can read more about it here,
1455800	1458240	but the point is that this is as ancient
1458240	1459560	as bacterial biofilms.
1459560	1461160	Already evolution had figured out
1461160	1465440	that processing information, storing memories,
1465440	1470440	collating inputs from other sort of spatially distant areas
1471520	1474840	was really well accomplished by bioelectrical networks.
1474840	1477960	So what we did was we developed some of the first tools
1477960	1480640	to read and write these electrical pattern memories
1480640	1482640	in morphogenetic contexts.
1482640	1485800	So the first is a set of voltage dye techniques,
1485800	1487280	which, so what you're seeing here
1487280	1489320	is this is a voltage sensitive fluorescent dye.
1489320	1491760	This is an early frog embryo.
1491760	1494200	You're looking at all the conversations
1494200	1495560	that these cells are having with each other
1495560	1497960	about who's going to be left, right, dorsal, ventral,
1497960	1498800	and so on.
1498800	1502200	And this is a video taken by Danny Adams in our group
1502200	1505640	that basically allows you to see,
1505640	1508320	much like people do with scanning activity in the brain,
1508320	1511160	allows you to see all the electrical conversations.
1511160	1513320	Now, we can also do a lot of modeling
1513320	1515320	and look at the various channels and pumps that are there
1515320	1519080	and ask, how does, where do these gradients come from?
1519080	1521120	I wanna show you a couple of examples.
1521120	1523720	This is a time lapse also made by Danny
1523720	1527400	of the first stages of a frog embryo
1527400	1528680	putting its face together.
1528680	1530240	So what you see here, and this is gray scale
1530240	1531840	instead of colorized, but same idea,
1532600	1534520	the brightness value indicates voltage.
1534520	1537320	And this is one frame taken from that video.
1537320	1539280	So what you can see here is that long before
1539280	1541040	these organs are actually formed,
1541040	1542720	the tissue here already has a plan
1542720	1544240	of where everything is gonna go.
1544240	1547440	Here's the eye, here's the mouth, here are the placodes,
1547440	1551400	and this eye is gonna come in shortly thereafter.
1551400	1554800	What happens is that this is a native
1554800	1558960	essential component of normal development.
1558960	1563080	And not only can you monitor this for incipient defects,
1563080	1564680	but we actually know that this is functional.
1564680	1565760	This is instructive.
1565760	1567920	If we move this bioelectrical pattern,
1567920	1570360	the gene expression changes and the anatomy follows.
1570360	1572120	I will show you that momentarily.
1572120	1574560	So this is a normal part of development,
1574560	1577640	a normal pre-pattern.
1577640	1579280	This is a pathological pre-pattern
1579280	1581760	where if we inject a human oncogene,
1581760	1583240	there will eventually be a tumor.
1583240	1586280	But even before that tumor becomes histologically apparent,
1586280	1588480	you can already see using voltage dye
1588480	1590960	that these cells have basically disconnected
1590960	1591880	from their neighbors.
1591880	1593760	And at this point, all they're going to do
1593760	1596840	is roll back to their ancient amoeba-like lifestyle.
1596840	1598040	As far as they're concerned,
1598040	1600440	the rest of the body is just external environment.
1600440	1602400	So we'll talk about the cancer soon.
1602400	1605000	So we developed some techniques
1605000	1607360	to actually start to read these patterns.
1607360	1611200	And then we developed even the more important component,
1611200	1614480	which is the functional technology to change them,
1614480	1618080	to write, not only to read these data states,
1618080	1619480	but to actually rewrite them.
1619480	1622120	And we basically took everything from neuroscience.
1622120	1625360	So there are no waves, no frequencies,
1625360	1627840	no electromagnetic radiation, no magnets,
1627840	1629960	and then nothing like that.
1629960	1633840	What we do is manipulate the native electrical interface
1633840	1636560	that these cells are using to control each other's behavior,
1636560	1639120	which are the ion channels and the gap junctions.
1639120	1644120	So we can genetically, pharmacologically or optically
1645240	1647200	control the various ion channels
1647200	1649280	and that changes the voltage states directly,
1649280	1651200	or we can control the gap junctions,
1651200	1653000	which determines who talks to whom.
1653000	1654760	So the topology of the network.
1654760	1656880	And that corresponds to synaptic plasticity
1656880	1660640	and intrinsic plasticity if this was a neural tissue.
1660640	1662440	So now I want to show you some examples
1662440	1663960	of what happens when you do this, right?
1663960	1666000	Why do I think that these electrical states
1666000	1668320	actually mean an eating for morphogenesis?
1668320	1670720	And so I'll show you a couple of examples.
1670720	1672120	This is one of them.
1672120	1673160	So here's an embryo.
1673160	1676520	I showed you that in that electric face image,
1676520	1679440	you saw that there was a particular bioelectric pattern
1679440	1681040	that said put an eye here.
1681040	1683760	So we simply said, okay, if we recapitulate
1683760	1685800	that pattern somewhere else,
1685800	1688200	could we convince other cells to make an eye?
1688200	1690120	And so in this case, in this example,
1690120	1692640	we've taken some ion channel RNA
1692640	1694760	encoding some potassium channels,
1694760	1697080	which we knew would induce that state.
1697080	1699560	We inject them into precursors of cells
1699560	1700600	that are going to make gut.
1700600	1701840	So this is endoderm.
1701840	1703160	And sure enough, they will go ahead
1703160	1704760	and make a very nice eye.
1704760	1708080	Now this, by the way, is a counter
1708080	1710560	to what you will see in the developmental biology textbook,
1710560	1713280	which says that only the anterior norectoderm up here
1713280	1714640	is competent to make eye.
1714640	1715480	This isn't true.
1715480	1717720	Well, it's true if you stick with the master I gene
1717720	1720560	called PAC-6, but it isn't true if you go upstream
1720560	1721760	to the bioelectric pattern
1721760	1724720	and you can make eyes anywhere on the tail, on the gut.
1724720	1727280	Anyway, notice a couple of interesting things about this.
1727280	1729640	First of all, that it tells you
1729640	1731680	that these bioelectric patterns are instructive.
1731680	1735560	We're not just screwing up some existing process.
1735560	1738160	We're actually telling these cells to build an organ,
1738160	1740840	which has all the right lens and retina and optic nerve
1740840	1742480	and all the right things.
1742480	1744320	Second is note the modularity.
1744320	1747000	What we did not do was put in enough information
1747000	1749000	to specify how to build an eye.
1749000	1750520	You don't have any idea of how to build an eye.
1750520	1752200	There are lots of different cell types
1752200	1754600	that are required in a very precise arrangement
1754600	1755440	to make a proper eye.
1755440	1756400	We didn't do any of that.
1756400	1760920	What we did was provide a high level trigger.
1760920	1761760	If you're a coder,
1761760	1763760	this is basically a subroutine call
1763760	1766360	that tells these cells you need to make an eye.
1766360	1767200	That's it.
1767200	1769040	Everything else is, all the complexities
1769040	1771000	pushed onto the system itself,
1771000	1773240	which is a very nice property for regenerative medicines.
1773240	1774560	So it's highly modular.
1774560	1777280	The bioelectric code is not a code for single cells.
1777280	1779800	It's a code for organs and up.
1779800	1784800	The other kind of capacity which is really interesting
1784800	1786600	and this harkens back to this idea
1786600	1789280	of the cells as a collective intelligence is this.
1789280	1792200	This is a cross section of a lens sitting out
1792200	1794800	in the tail of a tadpole somewhere that we've induced.
1794800	1796800	The blue cells, the labeled cells here
1796800	1799320	are the ones that have the ectopic ion channel.
1799320	1800600	But notice what's happening.
1800600	1802800	There's not enough of them to make a proper lens.
1802800	1804080	So what they've done is recruit
1804080	1805680	a bunch of their normal neighbors.
1805680	1807520	They've hijacked some of these other cells
1807520	1810240	to participate with them in this construction project.
1810240	1811600	This is something that often happens
1811600	1814760	in other collective intelligences like ants and termites
1814760	1817400	where a few of them will actually recruit
1817400	1821200	as many neighbors as needed to complete some larger task.
1821200	1824160	All of that is intrinsic to the tissue.
1824160	1825520	We did not have to do any of that.
1825520	1827960	All we said was build an eye.
1827960	1831280	All of the parts where the cells have to detect
1831280	1832760	is there enough of us to build the eye?
1832760	1835280	If not, how do we signal to the other cells to get them?
1835280	1838120	What should be the size of the eye, the structure of the eye?
1838120	1840520	All of this is handled by the tissue itself.
1840520	1841880	What we are doing is taking advantage
1841880	1844720	of these competencies, including recruitment.
1844720	1847240	So we can, using these same techniques,
1848080	1850480	we can make extra forebrains, as you can see here.
1850480	1851640	We can make extra legs.
1851640	1853280	Here are some six-legged frogs.
1853280	1857840	We can make extra hearts, extra odysses or inner ear.
1857840	1860880	Lots of different organs that we don't know how to make yet.
1860880	1862080	Also, we can make fins.
1862080	1863000	This is kind of interesting.
1863000	1864480	Tatboles aren't supposed to have fins.
1864480	1865480	That's more of a fish thing.
1865480	1867880	We'll get to that momentarily.
1867880	1872480	And so having seen that these bioelectric pattern memories
1872480	1874440	can actually call up different organs,
1874440	1878720	we began a project in regenerative medicine of the limb.
1878720	1880920	And so what happens here in the frog?
1880920	1884000	Frogs, unlike salamanders, do not regenerate their legs
1884000	1884840	at this stage.
1884840	1888000	And so you cut off the leg, and 45 days later,
1888000	1889440	there's basically nothing.
1889440	1892080	By the way, within 30 seconds of amputating,
1892080	1894200	so here's this bioelectrical signal at the wound,
1894200	1897280	within 30 seconds of this amputation,
1897280	1899760	you see the opposite untouched leg
1899760	1901440	has lit up exactly the same way.
1901440	1903680	So there's some kind of long range, and it's not neural.
1903680	1906640	You can take out all the spinal cord and all the neurons.
1906640	1907800	It still works.
1907800	1909360	There's this long range connection
1909360	1912560	that kind of carries information
1912560	1914160	about the anatomical order.
1914160	1918720	But what we did is we designed a drug cocktail
1918720	1924160	having to do with the ion levels and thus the voltages
1924160	1925560	of the cells in the wound to give it
1925560	1929080	a particular bioelectrical state that says rebuild the leg.
1929080	1930560	And when we do this, here's what happens.
1931120	1934560	Within a couple of days, this MSX1 major blastema marker
1934560	1935240	is expressed.
1935240	1936360	Here it is.
1936360	1938560	The leg starts to grow by 45 days later.
1938560	1939640	You've already got some toes.
1939640	1941400	You've got a toenail.
1941400	1943480	Eventually, you get a very respectable leg,
1943480	1945320	and it's touch sensitive and motile
1945320	1948160	so the animal can feel it.
1948160	1952200	The treatment itself is 24 hours with this drug cocktail.
1952200	1955400	The leg growth in an adult frog takes a year and a half.
1955400	1957040	You get a year and a half of leg growth
1957040	1958720	from a 24 hour intervention.
1958720	1961160	We do not touch them in between.
1961160	1963240	So the idea is not to micromanage this process.
1963240	1964920	It's not to tell the stem cells what to do.
1964920	1967240	It's not to control the morphogenesis.
1967240	1973720	It's to very early on to shift the navigation policy
1973720	1976640	of this collection of cells towards building a leg
1976640	1980480	and away from scarring and blockage.
1980480	1981000	And that's it.
1981000	1983440	It's an early stimulus, and then you leave the system alone
1983440	1984880	and let it do what it needs to do.
1984880	1986800	So at this point, I have to do a disclosure
1986840	1990280	because Dave Kaplan and I are scientific co-founders
1990280	1992680	of a company called Morphosuticals Inc.
1992680	1995240	And the goal is to take these insights
1995240	1997280	and now to do this in mammals.
1997280	2000120	And so the idea is we're currently in mice now,
2000120	2002520	hopefully someday in human patients,
2002520	2003840	but obviously we're not there yet.
2003840	2006080	This is kind of just the beginning.
2006080	2008320	So at this point, what I'd like to do
2008320	2012480	is to go back to the planaria and kind of to talk about,
2012480	2014840	again, the role of bioelectricity
2014840	2016880	and this idea of pattern memories
2016880	2019240	and how does it help us to understand
2019240	2021000	how a body keeps itself together?
2021000	2023840	Because this is really, in terms of a definitive solution
2023840	2025360	to aging, this is really it.
2025360	2028680	We really need to understand how cells come and go
2028680	2029880	all throughout the lifespan.
2029880	2034280	How does a particular large-scale anatomy hold together,
2034280	2036200	even though cells are coming and going?
2036200	2039560	And what does it take to reinforce that
2039560	2041320	so that we have a better health span
2041320	2045160	and that we can retard or abolish this as planaria
2045160	2047360	have this whole aging process?
2047360	2050200	So I just want to show you what we've done in planaria.
2050200	2053760	So here is a typical one-headed flatworm.
2053760	2055040	So you cut off the head and the tail.
2055040	2057160	You've got this middle fragment.
2057160	2060160	This is a genetic marker that shows us
2060160	2061680	where the anterior cells are.
2061680	2063720	So these are the cells that think they're
2063720	2067040	in the front of the worm and so they are.
2067040	2067880	And so if you do this,
2067880	2068960	if you cut off the head and the tail,
2068960	2071640	this middle fragment gives you a nice one-headed worm.
2071640	2072880	And so we asked a simple question.
2072880	2074360	How does this middle fragment know
2074360	2076440	how many heads it's supposed to have?
2076440	2080000	How many heads should it regrow and at which end?
2080000	2083880	And so it turns out we've discovered this pathway
2083880	2086880	involving potassium and proton fluxes.
2086880	2090720	It's an electric circuit that holds the information
2090720	2092960	of how many heads you're supposed to have.
2092960	2097600	And so what you can do is you can visualize it.
2097600	2098440	Here it is.
2099400	2101600	This fragment here has a pattern.
2101600	2103440	This is one head, one tail.
2103440	2105400	And so what we decided to do was to rewrite it.
2105400	2107760	And we rewrote it and we said, no, actually two heads.
2107760	2108640	And this is a little messy.
2108640	2110960	The technology's still being worked out.
2110960	2114000	But we said, well, a correct planarian
2114000	2115440	should have two heads like this.
2115440	2117360	And then what happens is if you take that animal,
2117360	2119600	and by the way, the gene expression is still normal.
2119600	2122900	The anterior genes are still in the front, not in the back.
2122900	2124560	But if you recut this animal,
2124560	2127400	what it does is it builds a two-headed flatworm.
2127440	2129840	This is not Photoshop, these are real.
2129840	2133080	The reason is because this is the actual pattern
2133080	2135680	that the cells are using to know what to build
2135680	2136520	and when to stop.
2136520	2137760	So I promised you at the beginning
2137760	2140200	that we were going to look at bioelectricity
2140200	2142560	as the medium of the collection of intelligence
2142560	2143400	of these cells.
2143400	2144920	That's literally what this is.
2144920	2147000	Very much like people are trying to read memories
2147000	2149700	of future goal states out of living brains,
2149700	2153480	we can now read bioelectrical target states out of tissue
2153480	2156760	to know what it's going to build and rewrite it.
2157040	2158720	So this is all the cells have to go on.
2158720	2160560	If the pattern now says two heads,
2160560	2161600	that's what they're going to build.
2161600	2163000	There's nothing they have to compare it with.
2163000	2166400	We've rewritten the target of this homeostatic process.
2166400	2169280	So really crucial, this electrical map
2169280	2171280	is not a map of this two-headed animal.
2171280	2173280	This is a map of this perfectly normal-looking
2173280	2176400	one-headed animal and before it gets cut.
2176400	2179080	So basically a single flatworm
2179080	2181440	can have two different representations
2181440	2183640	of what a correct body shape is.
2183640	2186960	And this shows you these large-scale features
2186960	2188760	of the body shape are literally encoded
2188760	2190800	in the electrical states of the circuit.
2191640	2193320	It's actually a kind of counterfactual memory
2193320	2194960	because it isn't true right now.
2194960	2196600	This animal does not have two heads right now.
2196600	2200240	This is a future, it represents what you're going to do
2200240	2202300	in the future if you get injured.
2202300	2204120	Now, I keep calling it a memory, why?
2204120	2207020	Because if we take these two-headed animals
2207020	2208560	and we amputate the primary head,
2208560	2211040	we get rid of this ectopic secondary head
2211040	2213760	and we just let it regenerate in plain water.
2213760	2217360	It will continue to give rise to two-headed animals forever.
2218600	2220000	We now know how to set it back.
2220000	2222840	And here you can see a video of what these guys look like.
2222840	2225120	So this has all the properties of memory.
2225120	2228080	It's long-term stable, it's rewritable.
2228080	2230160	It has conditional recall as I just showed you
2230160	2232600	and it has some possible discrete behaviors.
2232600	2234240	So this is quite subtle.
2234240	2237560	You can ask what determines the number of heads
2237560	2238520	in the planarian?
2238520	2241480	Well, on the one hand, what the genome does
2241480	2245320	is create a machine that has by default
2245320	2248920	an electrical circuit that naturally by default
2248920	2251320	will start off saying one head.
2251320	2252720	But that's not the only thing it can say.
2252720	2253840	It's reprogrammable.
2253840	2256860	And in fact, if you change it to say two heads, it will keep.
2256860	2259120	So the actual number of heads in the planarian
2259120	2260480	isn't genetically determined at all.
2260480	2262480	It's genetically determined is the hardware
2262480	2265800	and a kind of default state that's there
2265800	2267160	if nothing else happens.
2268160	2270280	But it's not just about head number.
2270280	2273040	It's also about head shape or morphology.
2273040	2275640	So what you can do is you can take this triangular headed
2275640	2278840	planarian, amputate the head, let the rest of the body
2278840	2280880	regenerate while you block some of this electrical
2280880	2282640	communication, it gets confused.
2282640	2284440	And sometimes it makes the right head,
2284440	2286200	but sometimes it makes round heads
2286200	2290640	like this S-meneterania or flat heads like this Pifelina.
2290640	2294960	These other species are about 100 to 150 million years distant.
2294960	2297040	There's nothing genetically wrong with any of these animals.
2297040	2300840	We've done no genomic editing, no synthetic circuits.
2300840	2303120	Not only the head shape, but the shape of the brain
2303120	2306160	is just like these other species.
2306160	2309440	And so what you're doing here is you're exploring other regions
2309440	2312280	of the morpho space for this genome.
2312280	2314640	Normally it goes here where it belongs,
2314640	2317520	but actually it can land in some other attractors that
2317520	2319560	are typically occupied by other genomes.
2319560	2322240	But you can visit that in software basically
2322240	2324480	by just changing the bioelectrical signaling
2324480	2328200	without actually having to change the genomic hardware.
2328200	2329600	And you can go further than this.
2329600	2331520	You can explore the latent morpho space
2331520	2335840	outwards and look at shapes that don't look like planaria at all.
2335840	2339200	So you can make these three dimensional cylindrical forms.
2339200	2340760	You can make these weird spiky shapes.
2340760	2342800	You can make hybrid forms.
2342800	2346120	And this ability of cells to build other things
2346120	2351200	than what they normally build is everywhere.
2351200	2353920	What evolution gives us when it produces cells and bodies
2353960	2358600	are a set of really, really highly hackable, highly
2358600	2362040	programmable machines for solving morphogenetic problems.
2362040	2363960	And not only bioengineers like us
2363960	2367120	learn to tap into these controls, but animals do it too.
2367120	2370200	So for example, in the plant world, this is an oak leaf.
2370200	2372960	And what's happened here is that you would look at an oak leaf
2372960	2375280	and you would think that these plant cells have only one
2375280	2379120	kind of capability, which is to grow this nice flat green thing.
2379120	2381680	But in fact, what happens is when
2381680	2384400	you act by an insect embryo, a wasp,
2384400	2386560	it gets the plant cells to build these kind
2386560	2390440	of remarkable three dimensional red structures out
2390440	2391160	of the plant cells.
2391160	2392080	These are not wasp cells.
2392080	2393160	These are plant cells.
2393160	2395600	And so the plant is basically doing what we do rationally.
2395600	2399920	The wasp does it evolutionarily by providing signals
2399920	2402160	that trigger these cells to build something completely
2402160	2402720	different.
2402720	2405760	So this plasticity, this ability to get cells
2405760	2409840	to build various things or to reinforce the standard morphology
2409840	2413400	is really what we're after in the control of growth and form
2413400	2416440	for the solution to these kind of biomedical problems.
2416440	2419480	So what we're doing now is building
2419480	2422200	a full stack computational system
2422200	2425520	where you can go from the genetics that tell you
2425520	2427640	which channels and pumps are in the cells
2427640	2429440	to the bioelectric simulations that
2429440	2432800	explain why the gradients are in a certain location,
2432800	2434520	what the behavior of these gradients
2434520	2438360	are, how they function as a passage of time.
2438400	2440800	And ultimately, what this means for algorithms,
2440800	2442880	for human understandable algorithms
2442880	2449040	to derive anatomical structure from these cell behaviors.
2449040	2452200	And so the last story that I want to tell you for a few minutes
2452200	2456600	is really how we use these computational platforms
2456600	2458560	to repair damage.
2458560	2462680	And so perhaps the best worked out system in the example
2462680	2465200	in this is that of the frog brain.
2465200	2467240	So here's a normal tadpole brain.
2467280	2469880	Here's the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain.
2469880	2473840	And there are a wide variety of teratogens, some of them
2473840	2476200	chemical like nicotine, alcohol, and so on.
2476200	2478400	And some of them genetic, which I'll show you in a minute,
2478400	2480080	that mess up brain formation.
2480080	2481720	So this animal has profound effects.
2481720	2483640	You can see the brain is completely abnormal.
2483640	2485080	The eyes are actually connected here.
2485080	2488120	It's missing the forebrain and so on.
2488120	2491640	So we asked the question, how could we repair this?
2491640	2494480	How could we induce repair of such a complex organ?
2494480	2495880	If we're going to repair, don't we
2495880	2498200	need to really understand every part of this
2498200	2501000	and really control every bit of this complicated shape
2501000	2501880	and function?
2501880	2503760	So what we did was we built a model,
2503760	2506120	and this was by our collaborator, Alexis
2506120	2511120	Pytaq, who created a computational model of the bioelectrical
2511120	2515160	pattern that we observed that normally tells this brain what
2515160	2516960	size and shape to be.
2516960	2519400	And we analyzed this computational model
2519400	2522760	to understand all the various ways that it could go wrong.
2522800	2525320	And in particular, we asked the model
2525320	2528240	to work backwards and to suggest an ion channel,
2528240	2530640	that we can, or one or more ion channels,
2530640	2533160	that we could open or close to get the pattern
2533160	2536000	to the correct state from an incorrect state.
2536000	2538720	So what you have here is you have a computer model
2538720	2542680	of the bioelectrics going on inside of a sheet of the nascent
2542680	2544960	brain cells, and the pattern isn't correct.
2544960	2547120	And so you asked the model, if I wanted to get this bioelectric
2547120	2549080	pattern back to where it should be,
2549080	2550080	what would I need to do?
2550080	2552280	What channels would I open and close?
2552320	2555120	And this particular model said something very interesting.
2555120	2558640	It pointed us to this thing called the HCN2 ion channel.
2558640	2561560	The HCN2 ion channel has a very particular interesting
2561560	2563160	property, long story short.
2563160	2566160	It acts kind of like a sharpen filter in Photoshop.
2566160	2568160	What it does is it sharpens voltage gradients
2568160	2572400	between regions of cells with different voltages.
2572400	2576960	And here's what that looks like.
2576960	2579880	I'm showing you the toughest example we have,
2579880	2582520	which is instead of a drug like nicotine or alcohol
2582520	2585160	or something like that, we used a genetic mutation
2585160	2587280	of the notch pathway.
2587280	2589520	Notch is a really critical neurogenesis gene.
2589520	2591600	It's very important for formation of the brain.
2591600	2592680	This is a normal brain.
2592680	2594760	This is a brain of an animal with a notch mutation.
2594760	2596560	You can see the forebrain is gone.
2596560	2598360	The midbrain and hindbrain are a big bubble.
2598360	2599400	They have no behavior.
2599400	2602000	They just lay there doing nothing.
2602000	2604360	So what we did was exactly what the model said,
2604360	2608400	which is that we treated it with one of two drugs that
2608440	2610240	opened up these HCN2 channels.
2610240	2614240	These, by the way, are already human-approved anti-epileptics.
2614240	2617640	And what happens is that the animals are repaired.
2617640	2618760	They get their brains back.
2618760	2621600	They not only get their normal anatomy back,
2621600	2623400	but they get their IQs back.
2623400	2625560	They are, in terms of learning rate,
2625560	2627440	they are now indistinguishable from controls,
2627440	2629200	whereas these guys could barely move.
2629200	2632880	And so what you see here is that some disorders,
2632880	2634920	and I'm not saying this is true for all of them,
2634920	2638640	but for some disorders, really nasty hardware problems
2638640	2640240	can, in fact, be fixed in software.
2640240	2644240	All we did was temporarily open a particular ion channel
2644240	2646840	to trigger this kind of improvement
2646840	2648880	of the native bioelectrical pattern.
2648880	2653880	So the whole pipeline looks something like this,
2654840	2656520	where we will have a system,
2656520	2659560	and you can already play with an early version of this online,
2659560	2663560	where you choose the tissues or organs that you're interested in,
2663600	2665480	whether normal or cancerous.
2665480	2667880	It knows all the ion channels that are expressed there,
2667880	2671200	because these are all present in databases and the literature.
2671200	2672680	And then there's the simulator,
2672680	2674360	which tells you which of these channels
2674360	2675440	you would need to open or close
2675440	2677440	to get this back to the correct state.
2677440	2679080	And that allows you, once you know which channels,
2679080	2680160	that allows you to pick a drug,
2680160	2683680	because something like 20% of all drugs
2683680	2686640	are ion channel drugs,
2686640	2689800	which means there's a huge potential pool
2689800	2691360	of so-called electroseuticals
2691360	2694280	that can be used to infer
2694280	2696840	how to make these changes from this computer model.
2698160	2700880	Just one kind of quick piece of information
2700880	2702640	to remind us that this is not all
2702640	2705000	just for these lower animals that we work with.
2705000	2706640	All of these different ion channels,
2706640	2708160	which work exactly the same way
2708160	2709880	in that some of our model systems
2709880	2714120	have all come out of channelopathy studies in human patients.
2714120	2716720	And in fact, if you look at the gene expression
2716760	2721760	downstream of various bioelectrical interventions,
2722560	2723680	as we did here,
2725160	2728000	the genes downstream of frog axolotl
2728000	2730840	and human mesenchymal stem cells are overlapping.
2730840	2732000	So the targets are all the same.
2732000	2733360	So this is a very ancient,
2733360	2735960	highly conserved system for body regulation.
2735960	2737680	And we have a lot of confidence
2737680	2740760	because of what we learn now in animal models
2740760	2744120	is gonna work well in medicine.
2744120	2746720	So just for a couple of minutes,
2746720	2750400	the last story I wanna tell you is about cancer.
2750400	2752560	So what we have here, again,
2752560	2754360	let's just remind ourselves what bodies are
2754360	2757000	because the right question for cancer
2757000	2758200	isn't why we get cancer.
2758200	2760120	The right question is, I think,
2760120	2762560	why isn't all cancer all the time?
2762560	2764120	Why is there anything other than cancer?
2764120	2767000	Because we are made of individual cells
2767000	2769480	that used to be individual organisms
2769480	2773080	that basically have two goals,
2773080	2774680	to go wherever life is good,
2774680	2776560	be metabolically and to proliferate
2776560	2778840	for each cell to become two cells.
2778840	2780200	But what evolution has done
2780200	2782240	is given them some amazing hardware,
2782240	2783560	including bioelectrical hardware,
2783560	2785960	but also biochemical and biomechanical,
2785960	2786800	that allows them to,
2786800	2789280	instead of working on unicellular level,
2789280	2790720	tiny little projects,
2790720	2793560	what they do is they work towards something much bigger.
2793560	2796520	They, together as a collective,
2796520	2798320	they navigate anatomical space
2798320	2799960	to build something like this.
2799960	2800800	And if it gets damaged,
2800800	2802880	they will rebuild it very much like ants do
2802880	2806360	for an ant colony and so on.
2806360	2808120	They continue to build something very large,
2808120	2810880	but this whole system has a failure mode,
2810880	2812720	and that failure mode is cancer.
2812720	2815400	This is glial blastoma in vitro.
2816520	2818560	What happens is that when individual cells
2818560	2821800	get disconnected from this collective,
2821800	2826160	they go back to their ancient unicellular past.
2826160	2828280	As far as they're concerned,
2828280	2830160	the rest of the body is external environment.
2830160	2832440	They're no more selfish than the rest of your body cells
2832520	2834640	is just that their cells are smaller.
2834640	2839640	Cancer is a reduction of the diameter of the self.
2839800	2841920	So from something very large,
2841920	2843960	where they're all part of building this one organ,
2843960	2846360	now it shrinks down to the level of a single cell,
2846360	2849040	and it just goes to pursue little single cell agendas.
2850320	2852000	So what we decided to do
2852000	2854800	was to use this kind of very strange way of thinking about it
2854800	2856240	to develop a therapeutic.
2856240	2860240	And so here are these tumors that are injected,
2860240	2862240	that are caused by injecting human oncogenes,
2862240	2864840	for example, nasty K-RAS mutants and so on.
2864840	2867400	And you can see here, the oncogen is labeled.
2867400	2868360	It's in red.
2868360	2869680	It's very strong in this area.
2869680	2870680	In fact, it's all over the place.
2870680	2871840	This is the same animal.
2873000	2874000	There's no tumor,
2874000	2876240	because even though if you were to sequence this genetically,
2876240	2877400	you would see the mutation, you would say,
2877400	2880080	ah, well, this is of course gonna be a tumor here.
2880080	2882560	There isn't any tumor despite them.
2882560	2883560	The oncogen is still there.
2883560	2884400	We haven't gotten rid of it.
2884400	2885560	It's quite strong,
2885560	2888440	but the cells, we force the cells to electrically
2888440	2891360	remain connected to the rest of the tissue
2891360	2894920	by including an ion channel that sets a particular voltage.
2894920	2898080	And we've basically forced them to remain part
2898080	2900480	of this construction project that builds nice skin
2900480	2903200	and nice muscle, regardless of what the oncogene is telling
2903200	2906320	it to do, which is to disconnect and go off on your own.
2906320	2908080	So you can see that, and so we're now,
2908080	2912640	we're currently in human glioblastoma kind of applications
2912640	2915680	to see if we can transition this to medicine.
2915680	2919240	So I'm gonna just summarize and then give you a couple
2920120	2922720	of bigger thoughts.
2922720	2924880	So what I've tried to argue is that
2924880	2926720	there's a physiological software layer
2926720	2929120	that sits between the genotype and the anatomy.
2929120	2932840	And it's a really important tractable target for biomedicine.
2932840	2936400	It's not all about the molecular details of the genome.
2936400	2939600	There's actually this physiological layer that's critical.
2939600	2942600	Evolution discovered very early on how powerful
2942600	2945240	the electrical component is of that layer
2945240	2948360	and lots of cells hack each other's behavior
2948400	2952320	by controlling these large scale electrical patterns.
2952320	2956120	We think that cracking this code in the sense of neural,
2956120	2958000	in the same sense as neural decoding
2958000	2962480	will reveal how cell networks and tissues
2962480	2963840	make group decisions.
2963840	2965360	And so we already have applications
2965360	2967840	where we can rewrite these pattern memories
2967840	2971600	to program new large scale shapes.
2971600	2973240	And there's some really exciting AI tools
2973240	2975720	that are coming online for the design
2975720	2979040	of specific strategies for regenerative medicine.
2979040	2981880	So this is going to be anything
2981880	2985920	that's going to help us control real time growth and form
2985920	2988600	is going to be really critical for the aging problem.
2988600	2990880	And in bigger picture,
2990880	2992960	I think that bioelectrical signaling
2992960	2995280	is very much like it does in the brain,
2995280	2997160	serves as a kind of cognitive glue
2997160	3000720	that binds individual cells towards larger purpose,
3000720	3004320	which is to maintain an organism against disorder,
3004320	3007200	which is aging cancer and everything else.
3007200	3010600	So kind of the last thing I just want to mention
3010600	3014720	is if we look at the space of all biomedical interventions,
3014720	3018000	you've got basically bottom up conventional strategies
3018000	3021120	which are all of these kind of hardware focus things.
3021120	3023800	And then you've got some ways to treat this top down.
3023800	3028000	And this is only now beginning to be sort of exploited.
3028000	3030360	And you can see lots more in these papers.
3031360	3035200	But this is where we get to take advantage
3035200	3037520	of the native intelligence of cells and tissues.
3037520	3039120	The fact that they're not just clockwork,
3039120	3040600	they have specific,
3040600	3042680	because they used to be independent organisms,
3042680	3044920	they have preferences, they have competencies,
3044920	3046600	they have memory, they have trainability,
3046600	3048760	I haven't even mentioned all of those,
3048760	3050400	the data for all of that.
3050400	3054680	But there's a large field of emerging information on that.
3054680	3056680	And really being able to take advantage of it
3056680	3058160	is extremely powerful.
3058640	3059720	And this is key.
3059720	3064080	People who study placebo effects and expectation effects
3064080	3065160	and really at this point,
3065160	3069160	anybody who studies any kind of drug action
3069160	3071000	has realized that the mind plays
3071000	3072800	a really important part in this.
3072800	3076080	And so Fabrizio Benedetti has this great quote that I love,
3076080	3078360	which is that words and drugs
3078360	3080120	have the same mechanism of action.
3080120	3082120	And he literally uses a brain scanning
3082120	3083400	and those kinds of technologies
3083400	3085240	to really show the mechanism of action
3085240	3087920	of having expectations about what various pharmaceuticals
3087920	3090840	do versus what the actual pharmaceutical does.
3090840	3092320	And I think that bioelectricity
3092320	3095360	is an incredibly attractive target
3095360	3097040	as a communication interface
3097040	3099000	between large scale intelligence,
3099000	3102960	between your expectations of these contextual
3102960	3107200	of behavioral cues, which is what informs a lot of,
3107200	3111520	whether a lot of how successful certain pharmaceuticals
3111520	3115080	are going to be and the actual molecular level outcomes.
3115080	3119720	Because as a human being or as any other animal,
3119720	3121280	your decision to get out of bed in the morning,
3121280	3123680	this high level kind of executive decision
3123680	3125320	of what you want to do,
3125320	3127880	has to filter down to change the molecular properties
3127880	3129880	of the cell membrane in your muscle cells.
3129880	3130720	In order to get out of bed,
3130720	3132560	you have to depolarize those muscle cells.
3132560	3134960	And so that bioelectric interface
3134960	3139800	is literally what takes a high level content
3139800	3143960	of an intelligent metacognitive individual
3143960	3147640	and converts it into changes of molecular signaling
3147640	3148720	within the cells.
3148720	3151400	And with bioelectricity is what does that.
3151400	3155280	And if we understood really how to manipulate that pathway,
3155280	3158480	we could have really, really radical medical applications
3158480	3162280	that are completely different than trying to cobble together
3162280	3164040	the addressing of symptoms bottom up
3164040	3166160	via drug design and things like that.
3166160	3167000	So I'll stop here.
3167000	3170400	I'm gonna thank all the students and postdocs
3170400	3173280	who did all the work and my many collaborators.
3173280	3174960	Again, three disclosures.
3174960	3177640	These are companies that we work with.
3177640	3180320	Our other funders are here
3180320	3182320	and most of all the model systems
3182320	3184760	because the animals do all the heavy lifting here.
3184760	3185800	So thank you.
3185800	3187800	I'll stop here and take any questions.
3191680	3195160	I just want to say, wow, that was great.
3195160	3196600	Thank you so much.
3196600	3197440	Thank you.
3197440	3198960	Absolutely fantastic.
3200080	3200920	I appreciate it.
3200920	3201760	Thank you.
3202040	3203360	That was amazing.
3203360	3204560	Yes, thank you.
3204560	3206840	Michael, yeah, mind-blowing stuff.
3206840	3207880	Hi, how are you doing?
3207880	3209040	Hello.
3209040	3211240	Yeah, I've been meaning to ask you
3211240	3215360	and just trying to get my head around this bioelectric pattern
3215360	3216840	that you're referring to.
3216840	3220680	So how is it distributed across the organism?
3220680	3223520	You have different ion channels active
3223520	3225680	in different parts of the organism.
3225680	3228640	How do you set it up?
3228640	3234600	Yeah, that's true in that there are, of course,
3234600	3237440	regionalizations of ion channel expression.
3237440	3240200	But that isn't the major part of it
3240200	3244520	because remember that if you imagine a field of cells
3244520	3247240	where every cell has exactly the same ion channels,
3247240	3249040	exactly the same ion channels,
3249040	3251560	you can still have all kinds of complex patterns
3251560	3255080	of bioelectric states because of self-organization
3255080	3258160	of think of touring patterns and the chemical.
3258160	3260320	So this is very familiar to people
3260320	3261360	who think about chemical signals.
3261360	3262960	You can have a well-mixed medium
3262960	3265880	where all the chemicals are homogenous
3265880	3267400	and yet you can have these very complex
3267400	3268760	self-organizing patterns.
3268760	3271120	Exactly the same thing is true in the bioelectric circuits.
3271120	3274080	You don't need to necessarily have different ion channels
3274080	3275840	to have different electrical states.
3275840	3280680	You can self-organize very kind of clever patterns.
3280680	3284040	But on top of that is overlay the fact that actually,
3284040	3286000	yes, some cells do have different ion channels
3286000	3286840	than other cells.
3288680	3292720	But when you control like where the eye goes, for example,
3292720	3295840	you go and localize your ion channel
3295840	3298880	and the state of these channels.
3298880	3301520	So yeah, so yeah, there's two ways.
3301520	3304000	There's two, we have two applications that I showed you.
3304000	3306320	One is, yeah, in a case of the eye,
3306320	3310400	we inject the channel RNA into a specific region
3310400	3312080	because that's where we want the eye to form.
3312080	3314440	So there's some localization there.
3314440	3316640	On the other hand, for example,
3316640	3319280	in the work that we did to induce,
3319280	3322040	let's say tail regeneration in a tap hole
3322040	3324000	that normally won't regenerate it,
3324000	3327280	we soak the whole animal and only the wound at the tail
3327280	3329360	is what actually regenerates.
3329360	3331800	We didn't provide any spatial specificity
3331800	3334000	and that's because there's also an element
3334000	3336080	and this is something else that's sort of stolen
3336080	3338560	from neuroscience here is there's an element
3338560	3339720	of attention in the system.
3339720	3341760	So the cells that are not injured
3341760	3344640	that are in a quiescent location where everything is good,
3344640	3346720	they ignored our signal completely.
3346720	3348640	And so it's only the cells at the wound
3348640	3351920	that need to know what to do that actually responded
3351920	3354040	and they grew a tail, the rest of it didn't did nothing.
3354040	3356680	And we have many, many examples of that actually.
3356680	3358120	The same thing for those,
3358120	3360760	for the anti-epileptics to repair the brain,
3360760	3363200	we didn't inject them in a specific location.
3363200	3365920	We soak the whole animal and the brain was repaired
3365920	3366760	and everything else.
3366760	3370280	In fact, in fact, other things got slightly better.
3370280	3372120	That's a whole other thing is that it's actually
3372120	3375640	a tune up for the whole organism, other organs,
3375640	3378040	developmental noise, which is like this variation,
3378040	3381200	normal variation, all of that got crunched down
3381200	3385400	into these embryos look like, I had scored them myself
3385400	3388720	when I first saw this effect, I looked at it myself,
3388720	3390280	they look like they come off an assembly line.
3390280	3392200	I mean, it would just like perfect,
3392200	3394080	like every, each one was exactly like each other
3394080	3395880	just reduces the noise.
3395880	3400160	So we didn't have to produce any spatial specificity there.
3400280	3402720	Do wounds have electrical signals?
3402720	3403720	Sorry?
3403720	3406320	Do wounds emit electrical signals?
3406320	3407160	Yes, yes.
3407160	3409720	This has been studied, I believe the first work on this
3409720	3413160	was like in the 1880s or something.
3413160	3414080	Yes, absolutely.
3414080	3417120	So every epithelial layer has a voltage across it.
3417120	3419120	And if you poke a hole in it, it'll short circuit
3419120	3421440	and all the cells nearby know where the wound is
3421440	3423240	by following the electric field lines.
3423240	3424800	And these things have been measured by,
3424800	3428000	I think Emil Dubois Ramon was the first to measure this
3428000	3429200	in the late 1800s.
3429200	3430840	This has been around for a long time.
3430840	3434240	We've had several questions in the chat queue
3434240	3435640	that I'd like to get to now.
3435640	3439800	I noticed Miles has had his hand up, he organized this.
3439800	3442800	So he gets priority, Miles.
3442800	3446600	And I don't recall who was asking another question
3446600	3450320	that may have been Paul or someone will,
3450320	3452760	we'll get back to you, Miles.
3454240	3455000	Thank you, Johnny.
3455000	3458320	I don't claim the probability, but thank you very much.
3458320	3462480	Dr. Levine, sorry, I'm from British,
3462480	3465760	British expression in South Africa, we say Levine.
3465760	3468800	But okay, the two things I wanted to talk about
3468800	3473000	was neural cellular automator.
3473000	3475360	Neural, if I don't know if you've come across the term
3475360	3478640	because they say they are inspired by your work.
3479480	3482360	So there's this distilled.pub.
3483920	3485720	That was our paper.
3485720	3486560	Yeah, yeah.
3487120	3490400	We collaborated with Alex Mardvintsov's team.
3490400	3491960	Yeah, I know the papers you made.
3491960	3493200	Okay, thank you, thank you.
3493200	3494960	So that's the one thing.
3494960	3496680	So that then I'm, that's answered my question.
3496680	3500080	So that's basically modeling the same thing in software.
3500080	3504560	And the other question was that we have a paper from
3504560	3508320	Judd Hough, I think it was 2019,
3508320	3511400	showing that in the adult, in the adult,
3511400	3516240	the human adult, any mammal or eukaryote,
3516280	3519720	there is the embryonic program
3519720	3524720	and the fetal program of development in the genome,
3525880	3527200	but it is switched off.
3528400	3531920	And they've been able to, well, I suppose,
3531920	3533120	look at the Yamanaka factors,
3533120	3535840	in a sense they seem to be switching them on again.
3535840	3540160	So the embryonic program and the fetal program
3540160	3543640	are switched off, they are called hypo, hypo methylated.
3544640	3547280	I don't know if you're familiar with this or what?
3547280	3548440	We also familiar with this.
3548440	3550560	Okay, then that also answers my question.
3551920	3557680	Yeah, I mean, the thing with the Yamanaka factors
3557680	3559440	is that what you're doing there
3559440	3562960	is regulating single cell state.
3562960	3564840	So you're telling one cell
3564840	3567400	that it's a primitive embryonic-like cell
3567400	3570160	and from there, that cell needs to be able
3570160	3571760	to figure out what to do by itself.
3571840	3573720	The problems that we've been talking about
3573720	3575560	are not single cell problems.
3575560	3577720	They are large-scale morphogenetic problems
3577720	3582720	and if all you do is set up a bunch of undifferentiated cells
3583920	3586880	without the proper anatomical cues,
3586880	3589280	what you will end up with is at best the teratoma
3589280	3592680	or some other kind of a tumor that grows out of control.
3592680	3594800	It's not enough to have,
3594800	3596920	the cells themselves are like the building blocks.
3596920	3598920	Yes, you need undifferentiated cells
3598920	3600280	to make the various tissues,
3600280	3601120	but it isn't enough.
3601120	3602480	By themselves, you will not get
3602480	3604880	the three-dimensional correct patterning.
3604880	3608400	So I think that obviously the Yamanaka factors
3608400	3611600	are incredibly interesting and important as a technology,
3611600	3613960	but it doesn't provide the answer
3613960	3614800	to what we're looking for.
3614800	3615640	I don't think.
3618320	3619160	All right.
3619160	3620000	Thank you very much.
3620000	3620840	Thank you very much.
3620840	3621680	Just one last comment.
3621680	3622520	Oh yeah.
3622520	3623640	The doctors in play at Harvard,
3623640	3627760	they show that when they crush the optic nerve in a mouse,
3627760	3630960	the same biochemical pathways were stimulated
3630960	3634680	as during the OSK Yamanaka factors.
3634680	3636200	So it's as if the wound
3636200	3638480	had the same effect as the reprogramming.
3639440	3641120	Yeah, yeah, I'm not surprised.
3641120	3645240	I mean, yes, and I know David's worked quite well.
3645240	3646240	I'm not surprised.
3646240	3648440	I think that's a fantastic finding.
3648440	3651400	And I think that that's the right way to do this.
3651400	3656240	In other words, it's the cellular environment
3656240	3658280	and the pattern memories in that environment
3658280	3660240	that are needed to tell the cells what to do.
3660240	3663360	It's not enough to just have plastic cells bottom up.
3666120	3666960	Very good.
3667800	3669800	Justin's next in queue.
3669800	3672200	Actually, kudos to Justin.
3672200	3675880	He's doing some outstanding things in our community.
3675880	3680880	He's been making videos lately
3680880	3685000	and I was honored to present one on genomic analysis
3685000	3686160	and longevity gene.
3686160	3689720	So Justin, do you wanna read this or Dr. Levin?
3689720	3692480	Do you wanna just read this yourself?
3694480	3695880	It's up on the screen now.
3695880	3696720	Yeah, I see it.
3699360	3704360	Well, it's hard to say more influential.
3706680	3709480	It's sort of like, I mean, they go hand in hand.
3709480	3711920	It's the right way to think about this
3711920	3716000	is using the framework of software and hardware.
3716000	3719000	So without the right hardware,
3719000	3720600	your software is not going to do anything.
3720600	3723280	So hardware is really important
3723280	3724400	and that's what the genetics does.
3724400	3726440	The genetics nails down the cellular hardware
3726440	3727560	that you have.
3727560	3731200	However, if the hardware is good
3731200	3734640	and biological hardware is definitely of that class,
3734640	3736920	the hardware does not by itself
3736920	3738320	determine what's going to happen.
3738320	3741240	It's the actual software and the reprogrammability
3741240	3743480	features that are going to determine what happens.
3743480	3745400	And I showed you one example.
3745400	3746760	Well, I showed you several examples
3746760	3749200	where the physiology overrides the genetics.
3749200	3752200	So you can make worms with the wrong species heads
3752200	3754080	even though the genetics is normal.
3754080	3758160	You can make animals with a very nasty oncogenic mutation
3758160	3760320	which in fact do not get cancer
3760320	3762880	even though the genetics are wrong.
3762880	3766000	And you can have a notch mutation
3766000	3767560	and still get a normal brain
3767560	3770920	if the electrophysiology is managed correctly.
3770920	3773200	So I'm certainly not going to say
3773200	3774320	that genetics isn't important.
3774320	3776240	It's critical.
3776240	3780600	But we now have ways to override the default behaviors
3780600	3782160	that are given by the genetics.
3782160	3784000	And I think we now have a better understanding
3784000	3785640	of what the genetics does.
3785640	3787040	It doesn't code directly
3787040	3789520	for any of these form and functions.
3789520	3791800	It's just the beginning of the control path.
3791800	3792640	Okay.
3792640	3794880	Yeah, I mainly ask that just because for so many years
3794880	3795720	and years and years,
3795720	3798000	so much funding has gone into genetics.
3798960	3803040	And that's the solution to aging and rejuvenation.
3803040	3807960	But it seems as though that's a minor part of the issue
3807960	3810520	listening to you and seeing the work that you've done.
3810520	3813400	Yeah, I hesitate to say minor.
3813400	3815040	I think it's also going to be important
3815040	3818400	because I can imagine sort of a two-part solution
3818400	3821120	where you need both, right?
3821120	3824920	So one can think about what actually happens
3824920	3825840	during regeneration.
3825840	3829480	Is it that cells are no longer remembering
3829480	3830640	the correct pattern memories
3830640	3833000	to keep up the tissues of the body?
3833000	3834800	Or perhaps that information is there,
3834800	3836840	but the cells are unable to execute.
3836840	3838800	So we actually don't know the answer to that.
3838800	3840960	And it's entirely possible that you will need both.
3840960	3842560	You'll need a way to strengthen
3842560	3844720	the bioelectric pattern memory.
3844720	3848920	And you will need a way to improve the cells' abilities
3848920	3849760	to obey.
3849760	3852880	And that may be some kind of, you know,
3852880	3856440	have a genetic or biochemical component to it.
3857800	3860600	And Justin, was your next question answered?
3863680	3866120	Yes, my next question was answered, that's right.
3866120	3868680	Okay, next in line, John Kramer.
3868680	3872240	And anyone who wants to ask a question verbally,
3872240	3876000	please click the little hand raising icon
3876000	3878200	and we'll put you in queue.
3878280	3883280	Okay, John, okay, how did the planar get energy
3883520	3885080	and biomass to regenerate?
3885080	3888120	I have an idea, but Dr. Levin.
3888120	3891640	Yeah, what happens is it's actually extremely interesting.
3891640	3896640	These planarians, when the fragment starts to regenerate,
3899840	3901400	it actually starts to shrink
3901400	3903120	because it has to be the correct size
3903120	3904920	to match the tiny little heads and tails
3904920	3905840	that are gonna be formed, right?
3905840	3907360	It's trying to keep proportional.
3907360	3910120	So it shrinks and the way it shrinks is through autophagy.
3910120	3912600	So it actually eats some of its own tissues
3912600	3915760	and that ends up being used to rebuild.
3915760	3917960	And in fact, even without injury,
3917960	3921120	the worm is constantly remodeling.
3921120	3923000	So if you starve it over months,
3923000	3924480	they will just get smaller and smaller,
3924480	3926080	but they keep perfect proportions.
3926080	3927920	So they're constantly remodeling themselves.
3927920	3930120	And once you feed them, they sort of get bigger
3930120	3934120	and they stay in the right allometric scaling throughout.
3934120	3935680	Amazing.
3935680	3937160	All right, Jameson,
3937160	3942000	which genes affected right after making changes?
3942000	3945600	Yeah, so I can give you a whole list.
3945600	3948320	We analyzed all this in several publications.
3948320	3950040	So I can send you the list.
3950040	3952800	There are many, all of the kinds of things
3952800	3953640	that you've heard of.
3953640	3957520	So Wnt pathway, BMP, FGF,
3957520	3961480	all of those pathways are there, but it's thousands.
3961480	3964640	There are many, many genes that are targeted.
3964640	3969640	All right, John Kramer, Pacific Eye Unchained Drugs.
3970520	3972240	Yeah, that depends on the drug.
3972240	3974960	There are some drugs that are extremely dirty
3974960	3975960	and non-specific.
3975960	3978480	There are other drugs that are much more specific.
3979520	3983040	The good news for some of these applications
3983040	3985400	is that you actually don't want to be too specific
3985400	3990400	because if you take, if you, let's say you block KV 2.1,
3990560	3993760	well, KV 2.2 is right there to take its place.
3993760	3995920	And so you sometimes want something
3995920	3997640	that will take out a whole family or in fact,
3997640	4000520	a whole class to make the change that you want.
4000520	4004280	But it varies greatly across the different drugs.
4006560	4007400	Okay.
4009120	4009960	Paul.
4009960	4012560	Yeah, I have a question with your,
4012560	4015760	with respect to your hardware, software analogy,
4015760	4018800	I've been in computer science for many, many, many years.
4019840	4021800	So I know something about that.
4021800	4024640	And Mike, it's more a comment from you
4024640	4029640	because the difference I see between the biological things
4030400	4033080	and computer software and hardware
4033080	4035320	is that with computer hardware,
4035320	4039840	the hardware doesn't generate and determine the software
4039840	4041000	in any sense.
4041000	4043720	In other words, you build a piece of hardware
4043720	4045960	and you don't automatically get software programs
4045960	4047560	that are running it, okay?
4047560	4051720	So how does the, and so I want your comment is the idea
4051720	4056480	of how does the genome and the basic biology
4056480	4059360	generate the software in a sense?
4059360	4060360	Yeah.
4060360	4062920	So what you're saying is true
4062920	4066680	with respect to the classic kind of architecture
4066680	4071480	where those two things are quite separate, right?
4071480	4072320	So you build a hardware
4072320	4074120	and then somebody else has to put the software on it.
4074120	4077480	That of course is only one type of computing device.
4077480	4081480	So we now have self-organizing computational systems
4081480	4084400	where nobody has to put the software on top.
4084400	4087600	So this is the field of self-organizing robotics,
4087600	4091520	artificial life, where we build these circuits that have a,
4091520	4096040	so just imagine a collection of,
4096040	4099240	we can start thinking about this as a collection
4099240	4103160	of electronic components for a simple analog computer, right?
4103160	4104680	When you've got the components,
4104680	4106040	if you connect them up in the right way,
4106040	4107720	you're going to get spontaneous behavior.
4107720	4110480	The whole thing is an electronic dynamical system.
4110480	4112600	It's going to have spontaneous behavior.
4112600	4114640	And depending on what the components are,
4114640	4116360	we can interpret that behavior
4116360	4117880	as various kinds of computations.
4117880	4119880	There's going to be inputs, there are going to be outputs
4119880	4123320	and nobody had to explicitly program a thing.
4123320	4125160	All of those computational behaviors
4125160	4128720	are a feature of the dynamical components of the system.
4128720	4131800	Now, the trick of course is to get the right components
4131800	4136440	that take advantage of various laws of computation.
4136440	4139600	The fact that, just to give you a simple example,
4139600	4141240	these ion channels,
4141240	4144040	there are voltage-gated current conductances.
4144040	4145480	They're basically a transistor.
4145480	4148480	So if you have a circuit in the right way,
4148480	4149520	you can make logic gates.
4149520	4150640	If you can make logic gates,
4150640	4152320	then you have various computations.
4152320	4155080	All of that is a kind of a dynamic,
4155080	4157320	you can take a dynamical systems approach to it
4157320	4159560	and think of it that way, but it's much more powerful
4159560	4161960	if you actually ask what computations is it doing.
4161960	4166960	So I think in biology, we have very well developed
4167000	4168640	something that the computer technology
4168640	4170720	is only just starting to exploit,
4170720	4174000	which is self-organizing computational circuits.
4174000	4175320	That's what I think we have.
4175320	4178600	Robert, young, I like where you're going.
4178600	4181600	Ideas for applying this to solve aging.
4182960	4187960	Well, yeah, and I'm certainly not an aging expert.
4188560	4191560	We don't have any work directly on aging yet.
4192640	4196120	The idea is I think that the solution to aging
4196120	4198440	is going to basically fall out of the solution
4198440	4202000	to all of these other disorders of morphogenesis.
4202000	4204600	I think that aging is fundamentally a disorder
4204600	4206360	of morphogenetic control.
4206360	4211120	And when we, and I don't mean just my lab at the field
4211120	4214160	as a whole, when we solve this problem
4214160	4216040	of maintaining morphogenetic control,
4216040	4217960	aging will be one of the applications
4217960	4220800	along with regeneration, along with cancer reprogramming
4220800	4221640	and so on.
4222840	4226200	I think the key is to ask how do the cells know
4226200	4227800	what to do in the first place?
4227800	4229280	And the solutions to that
4229280	4231240	will be the solutions to aging as well.
4232160	4233720	Very good.
4233720	4235520	Next, another one from Jason.
4235520	4237580	Let me adjust my screen.
4238520	4240360	Mine was just more of a comment
4240360	4244680	to Robert's question on how might be applied to aging.
4245160	4246000	Okay.
4247240	4248360	Jeff, Parker.
4249440	4251000	Yeah.
4251000	4253520	Yeah, so tissue regrowth after scarring.
4253520	4257840	So we don't have any published data in mammals yet,
4257840	4262120	but we did do work in the frog where we showed that
4262120	4265120	even after it scars over with this,
4265120	4268240	what they call a non-permissive epithelium,
4268240	4270280	which normally doesn't allow the thing to regenerate,
4270280	4272440	this like thick epithelium,
4272440	4274040	we can still trigger regeneration.
4274040	4275520	So I'm optimistic.
4275520	4279080	But if you're asking about human patients,
4279080	4280360	we don't have any data on that yet.
4280360	4281200	So we'll see.
4282280	4283560	Okay.
4283560	4286080	And Jeff's next question.
4287920	4291480	I've applied to common degenerative diseases of aging.
4291480	4295440	Well, you may have applied to answer some of that.
4295440	4298120	Yeah, yeah, again, I don't know.
4298120	4303120	We don't have data on mammalian arthritis or COPD.
4305320	4306480	We haven't done that,
4306480	4309920	but I think that to the extent that we figure out
4309920	4312440	where normal lung tissue comes from in the first place
4312440	4314760	or what a normal joint is supposed to be,
4314760	4317880	we will be able to trigger that regenerative process
4317880	4318720	throughout.
4318720	4323720	So my hope is to be able to continuously induce
4324200	4327680	and up-regulate basically like what planaria do,
4327680	4330600	where they're constantly refreshing their tissues
4330600	4331440	all the time.
4333920	4334760	Okay.
4337320	4341280	Jason would be interested in seeing that map.
4341280	4343640	Sorry, what map are we talking about?
4343640	4346040	At one point you were talking about sort of a mapping
4346040	4350600	between a bioelectric signal and a change in genes
4350600	4352200	or a change in gene expression.
4352200	4353480	Oh, gene expression, I see.
4353480	4355880	Yeah, yeah, I can, yeah, that's fine.
4355920	4358760	Drop me an email and I'll send you the paper.
4358760	4362120	I'll warn you in advance that we did it
4362120	4364640	because a lot of people are interested in that question,
4364640	4369640	but I found it highly kind of uninformative
4372440	4375200	because what it does is it tells you
4376360	4380960	how individual cells are altered by the bioelectrical change,
4380960	4384400	but all the problems that we're actually interested in
4384400	4386200	are not single cell problems.
4386200	4389000	So knowing what happens to individual,
4392040	4395800	what happens to the individual transcripts in single cells
4395800	4399080	is that hasn't actually told us very much
4399080	4401280	about how to control the whole business.
4401280	4405480	So when you turn on the eye pattern,
4408240	4411680	you see that you start to turn on all of the eye genes.
4411680	4414760	So you get Paxix and Rick Swan and all of these things.
4414760	4416680	Someone's microgones on and it's fading back.
4418800	4419640	Hang on.
4421480	4423000	Okay, we're good.
4423000	4424840	Go ahead, please, sorry.
4424840	4426280	Yep, no problem.
4426280	4429000	So you see that those things are turned on,
4429000	4430480	but what you'd really like to know
4430480	4432840	is how did that collection of cells,
4432840	4434640	it's not a single cell question,
4434640	4437520	how did that whole field of cells take,
4437520	4440120	convert that bioelectric pattern
4440120	4442400	and decide that that maps onto an eye
4442400	4444480	rather than some other organ?
4444480	4446320	Not what happened to individual cells,
4446320	4448920	but what's the large scale decoding?
4448920	4451440	So we know the genes,
4451440	4454240	but that doesn't actually answer the question.
4454240	4457160	And so it's some of the other kinds of approaches
4457160	4459920	that we've taken with large scale modeling
4459920	4461920	and some of the machine learning and so on
4461920	4464120	that are really going to answer this.
4464120	4466440	Yeah, it seems like you sort of need a mapping
4466440	4468560	then between a bioelectric signal
4468560	4471680	and how it alters actual tissues or organs, right?
4471680	4472520	That's exactly right.
4472520	4473880	That's exactly right.
4473880	4475200	That's the bioelectric code.
4475200	4477320	That is precisely what we're trying to map out.
4477320	4478960	Just a quick follow up.
4478960	4481720	How do you see this area of research interfacing
4481720	4484120	with areas like quantum biology?
4485640	4486560	Yeah, good question.
4486560	4488160	I've been asked that before.
4488160	4490760	I don't know specifically for quantum biology.
4490760	4495040	I'm not an expert in quantum anything and I don't know.
4495040	4497560	So far, everything that we've been doing here
4497560	4499080	is purely classical.
4499080	4504080	We don't use any quantum formalisms yet.
4504280	4507840	We basically just use standard neuroscience,
4507840	4509280	standard electrophysiology
4509280	4513120	and standard connectionist kinds of network modeling.
4513120	4514240	So I don't know.
4514240	4518640	I don't know if there's a role for quantum kinds of processes.
4518640	4520880	I assume biology exploits it
4520880	4523440	like it exploits everything else that it can,
4523440	4526200	but our models don't include that right now.
4527640	4528480	Thank you.
4532320	4534680	Okay, a couple more questions in chat.
4534680	4539120	I will copy them, but first I had one.
4539120	4542280	How can we support your work?
4543600	4544880	Well, thank you.
4544880	4549520	I guess at this point, where the field is
4549520	4552600	is that we know what to do.
4552600	4554080	We're not stuck anywhere.
4554080	4557560	There are no great fundamental blockades
4557560	4558800	other than resources.
4558800	4561440	So right now it's pretty scalable,
4561440	4563520	meaning that if we had more people working on this,
4563520	4564480	it would move faster.
4564480	4568480	It's not every field is at that stage,
4568480	4569680	but this one kind of is.
4569680	4573200	So yeah, if you know of any leads on,
4573200	4578200	and we have lots of potential sources for funding,
4579200	4583400	but all of them take up significant time,
4583400	4586360	the pursuit of research funding takes significant time.
4586360	4590640	So any leads on that are helpful.
4590640	4593360	That's basically the rate-limiting step at this point.
4595520	4600520	Okay, I'm going to, since Miles has given so,
4602160	4604360	oops, sorry, given so much of his time
4604360	4607520	to organize this and other meetings, he gives priority.
4607520	4610640	So are using any AI tools?
4611640	4616200	Yeah, we use a variety of AI techniques.
4616200	4618720	We don't really use any off-the-shelf tools
4618720	4620200	that I can think of.
4620200	4622880	We basically make most of our own.
4622880	4627880	And the idea is to understand the decision-making
4630920	4633600	and the memory of the cells themselves.
4633600	4634880	So it's kind of a tight,
4634880	4638400	we're not just using AI tools to crunch the data,
4638400	4640960	we're actually trying to understand the cells
4640960	4643120	as a kind of intelligence, you know,
4643120	4644960	artificial or not that that kind of doesn't matter,
4644960	4647480	but it's a kind of unconventional intelligence.
4647480	4649920	And we're trying to use it.
4652280	4657280	Yeah, Roy Cutler, good to see you again.
4662160	4663920	And I'll reformat this.
4665480	4668120	Are you able to reverse?
4668320	4669560	You can read it.
4669560	4674560	Yeah, sort of in the case of,
4676080	4678720	so for example, in the case of the leg regeneration,
4678720	4681000	that's part of what happens.
4681000	4683080	It's not so much reversing.
4683080	4684520	It's, you know, for example, in the frog,
4684520	4688200	much like in the human, there's no de-differentiation.
4688200	4689720	It just, skin makes more skin,
4689720	4692040	muscle makes muscle, bone makes bone and so on.
4692040	4694920	It induces tissue renewal and patterning.
4694920	4696600	It's not so much,
4696600	4699320	it's not so much necessarily a differentiation issue,
4699320	4701880	but we have, for example, in vitro,
4701880	4706280	you can control human mesenchymal stem cells that way.
4706280	4708480	What we bi-electrically, you can control
4708480	4710440	whether or not they differentiate.
4710440	4713600	So this is one way to control differentiation,
4713600	4715600	but that again, that's not really enough
4715600	4719280	to, that's not where the power of the approach lies.
4720400	4722280	And how are you set for time?
4722280	4724720	Do you have time for a few more?
4724720	4726560	I will tell you, what time is it?
4726560	4728480	I got about five minutes.
4728480	4730880	Okay, Jeff's question,
4730880	4734400	and I will be reformatting another one or two
4734400	4735560	that are in chat.
4737200	4738680	Let's see, companies work well.
4739560	4742960	What, yeah, I can't say too much other than we do,
4742960	4747160	we do have this company called Morphosuticals Inc.
4747160	4752160	And we're focusing on limb regeneration and stay tuned.
4752360	4754440	There will be papers coming out,
4754440	4756840	hopefully later this year.
4756840	4761840	All right, John's, yeah, John's question, optical.
4762640	4765240	Yeah, we've used optogenetics.
4765240	4767400	We've used optogenetics to trigger regeneration,
4767400	4770280	to trigger limb formation, to suppress cancer.
4771200	4774120	Unclear to me whether that's gonna be really
4774120	4775280	the way to go in the clinic,
4775280	4779320	because it requires the cells to be expressing
4779320	4781960	a light-gated ion channel,
4781960	4783360	which is very good in the laboratory,
4783360	4784920	because then you know exactly what you've done,
4784920	4786280	and it's very nice.
4786280	4790600	But you don't want to have to give your patient
4790600	4793680	gene therapy to get those light-sensitive channels in there.
4793680	4797680	So I'm not sure that will actually be how we do the clinic.
4799040	4804040	Okay, and I was popping and I trust that includes
4806280	4808400	an answer to John's second question.
4809400	4812360	John Kramer, developing drugs and...
4814400	4815240	Okay.
4815240	4818680	Yeah, well, there's a huge amount of emphasis
4818680	4822000	on discovering new drugs for ion channels.
4822000	4825480	So lots of the big pharma companies are doing that
4825480	4827600	for other reasons, not having anything to do
4827600	4832320	with bioelectricity necessarily, but so yes,
4832320	4835920	but that's not really the right limiting step right now.
4835920	4837920	We have plenty of drugs for ion channels.
4837920	4840800	I mean, we can always use more, but the issue isn't
4840800	4843520	that we don't have enough drugs for specific channels.
4843520	4848040	The issue largely is that we don't have enough physiomic data.
4848040	4853040	So we need bioelectrical state data on a health and disease
4854120	4858120	and a wide range of tissues across patients, all of that.
4858120	4861560	And then we can develop specific strategies.
4862560	4863400	Cool.
4864880	4868040	Let's see, next, John Wenger.
4868840	4872600	And I see, I mean, you said five minutes,
4872600	4874080	so I'm taking that literally,
4874080	4876840	and I think we have about two and a half left.
4876840	4879000	So I'm watching the clock here
4879000	4881120	because I want to keep you on schedule.
4881120	4886120	Yeah, we've never, I have no idea, in a planarian,
4886160	4888760	we've never done anything like that,
4888760	4890400	it's physically moving cells around.
4890400	4892360	So I don't know what would happen.
4892360	4893200	Okay.
4896720	4901320	And Justin's question, in case you can't see it all,
4901320	4902520	I'll reformat it.
4906040	4909560	Yeah, I understand the question.
4909560	4911880	I'm not sure we're gonna have to worry
4911880	4915040	about the correct places in the correct period of time.
4915040	4918480	In the frog, for example, we soak the whole animal
4918480	4920040	and we do it for 24 hours
4920040	4921600	and then we don't touch them again.
4921600	4924440	And that is enough to trigger a year and a half
4924440	4927000	of new organ growth in the correct place.
4927000	4931480	And so my hope is that if we correctly understand
4934400	4936800	if we correctly understand how the cells
4936800	4938320	process this information,
4938320	4942240	we're not gonna have to micromanage the delivery spatially.
4945160	4947320	Yeah, the magnetic field of the earth.
4947320	4951880	Well, so we know that the magnetic field
4951880	4953440	is important for some things,
4953440	4956440	as you say, like navigations and navigation,
4956440	4960400	the kinds of electrical signals that we are working with,
4962040	4965840	the weak field of the earth doesn't really impact them.
4965840	4967400	I mean, people have done experiments
4967400	4970200	where you shield them off from the magnetic field
4970200	4972360	of the earth using new metal and things like that.
4972360	4975400	And some people, there have been some effects reported,
4975400	4977880	but it's not, it's really kind of,
4977880	4980200	there's not this really strong evidence
4980200	4982160	for the need of a magnetic field
4982160	4986240	for the kinds of very, very kind of strong electrical exchanges
4986240	4987440	that we're talking about.
4989240	4990080	Hey.
4990080	4990920	Outstanding.
4992920	4994040	Thank you so much.
4994040	4995880	Miles, quick one.
4995880	4998000	Just the last question, just the last question,
4998000	4998920	Dr. Levine.
4998920	5002640	So if you wanted to control the electric field
5002640	5006200	down to a more granular level with you
5006200	5009240	on the embryonic, during the embryonic stage,
5010200	5012840	would you be looking at things like nanotechnology
5012840	5017840	or sort of point conductors to sort of change
5017840	5020080	the shape of the embryos?
5020080	5025080	You could, but my own thinking is that that's,
5025440	5026720	we actually want to go in the wrong,
5026720	5028040	in the opposite direction.
5028040	5032200	We don't want to be micromanaging the minute states.
5032200	5036160	We want to have very low information content,
5036160	5039440	large scale signals that let the cells themselves
5039440	5041160	handle all of the details.
5041160	5042440	In everything that we've done,
5042440	5044560	the most powerful interventions are the ones
5044560	5046400	where we leave the most to the cells,
5046400	5048200	where we do not try to micromanage it.
5048200	5050280	I'm sure there will be applications where that's useful,
5050280	5053360	maybe especially in synthetic morphology,
5053360	5056120	but I don't think that's long-term.
5056120	5057920	I don't think that's the way here.
5059000	5061720	Well, as some guy who used to travel around
5061720	5065760	the galaxies on a starship used to say, fascinating.
5067280	5068200	Thank you so much.
5068200	5069120	Thank you so much, everybody.
5069120	5070080	Great, great discussion.
5070080	5070920	Really appreciate it.
5070920	5071840	Thank you.
5071840	5072680	Thanks.
5072680	5073520	Bye-bye.
5073520	5074360	Great job.
5074360	5075200	Thank you.
5075200	5076020	Thank you.
5078560	5079400	Okay.
5082280	5083960	If anyone has something else to say,
5083960	5085520	it's going to be a hard act to follow.
5085520	5088240	Any other thoughts, ideas?
5092280	5093520	Next topic, Miles,
5093520	5098600	I believe you had another thing or two to say.
5098600	5102080	Yes, no, no, he caught the scientific community
5102080	5106160	completely unprepared from left field.
5106160	5108400	He totally, I think about 10, 15 years ago
5108400	5112160	when he started, it was totally like Jason was saying,
5112160	5115080	the focus was on the genes.
5115080	5118600	And this level of control, which is comprehensive,
5118600	5123600	it's the actual morphology was completely unexpected.
5123640	5128160	So that's why, I mean, amazing is he's broken the barrier
5128160	5129760	for organ formation.
5130680	5133880	You see the extra limbs, the extra legs,
5133880	5136320	you see them coming out of the frog.
5136320	5138800	And that was a massive, massive advance.
5138800	5140960	So he's really done something fantastic.
5143920	5147300	Well, Miles, what was your next agenda item?
5148600	5152760	Well, it was actually the next agenda item was after him,
5152760	5156320	I did keep something else, which was the fact that
5156320	5160120	we have a complete, this has been a discovery in 2019,
5160120	5161120	something very interesting,
5161120	5163040	which I found very, very interesting.
5163040	5167320	There is a complete record of the program
5167320	5172320	of your embryonic stage and your fetal stage in your cells.
5173760	5176840	You've got a record and it is not just there,
5176880	5181880	it is carefully packed away and it is tagged, it's tagged.
5182960	5186440	And it seems that the people from Harvard,
5186440	5189440	Dr. St. Clair has been starting to talk about this now,
5189440	5191560	because manipulating that program,
5191560	5194680	which I think is what Dr. Levine's work is partially doing,
5194680	5198640	he's busy manipulating this program that's packed away,
5198640	5200520	is gonna be the next big thing,
5200520	5205120	the next big thing in anti-aging and in medicine,
5205240	5206400	in surgery.
5206400	5209320	I was gonna to flash very quickly the relevant paper,
5209320	5212340	if you don't mind, just quickly flash the paper.
5214840	5216880	Let me just see which one was it.
5229160	5230000	Oops.
5231960	5234400	Sorry people, I'm just looking for my,
5235880	5238720	okay, let me just check if I can see the paper.
5239880	5244880	Yes, I don't know if you, can you see that?
5245160	5246000	Yes.
5246000	5246840	Are you able to see that?
5246840	5249040	Is it over the place?
5249040	5252520	Sorry, can you see the paper?
5252520	5255240	Yes, it could be a little larger.
5255240	5259200	Okay, no, I think Johnny, I'm using Linux tonight,
5259200	5262240	I've had issues with my Windows computer,
5262240	5263720	so I'm using Linux.
5263720	5266480	So I think I'll just, if you can't see it,
5266480	5270440	the title is Extensive Recovery of Embryonic Enhancer
5270440	5271640	and Gene Memory.
5271640	5275520	Gene memory stored in hypermethylated enhancer DNA.
5275520	5278720	The title doesn't quite do justice to what they are
5278720	5282120	describing because it's actually earth shattering.
5282120	5285520	Basically what they're saying is your embryonic program
5285520	5288920	is still with you, it's still packed away in your genome,
5288920	5290600	as well as your fetal program,
5290600	5293360	because there's a difference between the embryonic program
5293360	5296320	and the fetal program, basically the embryo
5296320	5300640	is formed in the first eight, first, what's it?
5300640	5304200	Let me put it this way, the embryo is formed first
5305440	5307800	up to about the eighth week of pregnancy
5307800	5310280	and then after that you're a foetus.
5310280	5313160	And the two stages uses different sections
5313160	5315480	of the genome to make you.
5315480	5317680	And what's fantastic is that the program
5317680	5322440	that was used to make you 98% of it is still in your DNA,
5322440	5325840	carefully packed away and also tagged.
5325840	5327200	So what people are starting to do
5327200	5329320	is just sort of manipulate this program.
5329320	5331240	And I think that's what Dr. Levine is doing,
5331240	5333600	he's actually manipulating this program,
5333600	5336080	which is why we see this perfect restarting
5336080	5337880	of the growth of organs.
5337880	5339960	So that's something I wanted, I have not,
5339960	5341200	I didn't put it on our group
5341200	5344520	because I wasn't sure how long Dr. Levine would be.
5344520	5346720	Maybe we can have another discussion later on,
5346720	5348240	but I thought I'd just throw this in here
5348240	5350720	because this is also quite earth shattering.
5351680	5355200	The fact that you can rerun,
5355200	5357720	you can rerun the development mental program
5357720	5359800	because it is still in you.
5365200	5367600	I don't know if there was any questions about that.
5367600	5368440	Yeah.
5378320	5383040	That's a big breakthrough, an important thing to know,
5383040	5388040	and one component of the program to aging.
5390000	5391040	Go ahead.
5391040	5391960	Yes.
5391960	5393560	Yeah, this is John Wenger.
5394560	5397400	So I'm remembering,
5397400	5400760	I think it might have been from my introductory
5400760	5402600	college zoology class,
5402600	5407200	but there's a saying that with regard to development,
5407200	5409200	and that I think was something like
5409200	5412240	ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.
5412240	5415560	I'm not even wondering about phylogeny.
5415560	5418040	Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.
5418040	5419600	Phylogeny is right, yeah.
5419600	5423200	Yeah, and the, and this seems relevant.
5423200	5425840	I mean, it seems like what we're talking now,
5425840	5428400	what you just said is a slight elaboration
5428400	5432760	of that principle, namely that the whole genome
5432760	5435360	is there for the different stages of development
5435360	5440360	starting from an embryo to a fetus, et cetera, et cetera.
5444240	5445720	And now people are trying to figure out
5445720	5448400	how to replay parts of those things.
5449400	5454400	The, it's really handy that all this,
5456960	5461560	these genetic patterns of development and our youths
5461560	5464360	are preserved because as we get older,
5464360	5468400	where our genome are controlling active,
5468400	5472240	our current genome gets corrupted, we think.
5472240	5477240	And so the idea of, and people talk about taking your,
5478120	5481880	your genes and doing gene banking or your DNA banking
5481880	5483320	and that sort of thing.
5483320	5487400	Well, if it turns out that the younger DNA
5487400	5489720	is still in our system somewhere,
5489720	5493320	a different piece of the total genome,
5493320	5495920	well, that's handy because then that gives you access
5495920	5499800	to a younger genome and that obviously bears
5499800	5503000	on the problem of aging reversal.
5503840	5507640	Absolutely, yes, correct.
5507640	5508480	Absolutely.
5509840	5510880	Which is exciting.
5512040	5515600	Extremely, it's as if the biology has handed us a gift.
5517400	5521240	Yeah, well, it's not exactly the, I mean,
5521240	5526240	it's, I don't think biology, yeah, it is as if the candidate
5527360	5532600	is a gift, but in a sense, I mean,
5532600	5534360	it's kind of interesting, it's always been there.
5534360	5536600	We just need to open our eyes and look at it.
5536600	5538400	That requires the right kind of eyes
5538400	5541600	and the right kind of mind to be able to see that.
5541600	5546600	But I really liked Michael's conception
5548480	5550160	because I really think that genetics
5550160	5552840	is sort of taken over biology.
5552840	5557840	And I think he's right that the real intelligence,
5558120	5563120	well, not all of the, all the information's not in the genome.
5565400	5569240	There's something about what Heb called cell assemblies,
5569240	5571800	the notion of where does intelligence come from?
5571800	5575400	And the notion is that the neurons would organize
5575400	5577920	into cell assemblies with various functions.
5577920	5582440	And it's clear that different chunks of the body
5583320	5585120	have their own internal intelligence.
5585120	5587280	That's why I asked the question about what would happen
5587280	5592280	if you took, injected some eye cells and some hearing cells.
5592520	5595440	I don't even know if Plenaria can hear,
5595440	5598480	but how would they determine whether to grow an eye
5598480	5603160	or an ear, sort of Plenaria ear in the same place?
5603160	5608160	Well, these organizational fields would have to,
5608160	5612760	in some sense, either fight it out or coexist.
5612760	5615960	And maybe they would segregate themselves voluntarily.
5616080	5620360	And so you'd have an eye in the tail and an ear in the tail,
5620360	5622800	not in the very same spot, but nearby,
5622800	5625040	not in the head, but back in the tail.
5625040	5628920	And so I really think that he's really onto it.
5628920	5631840	I mean, it's so, it's just mind blowing.
5631840	5634840	It's such an important discovery
5634840	5639080	because there's so much information.
5639080	5642280	That's why I was asking the question too about the optics.
5642280	5644040	In one of his earlier slides,
5644040	5645480	and Johnny, you did have this recorded.
5645520	5647240	I really hope you can see this.
5647240	5649320	I'd like to look at his slides some more.
5649320	5654320	There was an optogenetic term in one of his manipulations there,
5654800	5658600	but it strikes me that there may be,
5658600	5660360	just as there are electrical ways,
5660360	5663000	he's manipulating with electrical fields,
5663000	5665720	but there are other fields too, there are optical fields.
5665720	5670720	And the bigger picture might be the combined manipulation
5671600	5674480	with electrical fields and optical fields.
5675480	5680480	Because nature is very, very clever
5681760	5683480	at using things in combination.
5683480	5687720	I think that's sort of the point of his talk.
5688600	5690320	So I've kind of gone up for a little bit here,
5690320	5692400	but I hope I've stimulated a few thoughts.
5694360	5698240	I'm finding, I found that talk to be really
5698240	5702040	changing my perspective on the direction we've been going.
5702040	5705440	It almost seems like our focus on drugs
5705440	5708280	and even gene editing in CRISPR,
5708280	5712440	we're still reprogramming the computer with a soldering iron.
5712440	5713280	That's right.
5714360	5715800	That's absolutely right.
5715800	5720960	Approach is no, we're gonna create software to change life.
5721920	5725440	And it's pretty mind-boggling.
5725440	5728400	I think the issue is not that we should be creating,
5728400	5729800	we should be creating the software,
5729800	5733040	we should be locating the software that's already in us
5733040	5736200	and exploiting that software and giving it a chance
5736200	5737960	to function in an older body
5737960	5740160	as it functioned in a younger body.
5740160	5741960	I think the software is already in us.
5741960	5746960	If our genome contains our fetal plan
5749760	5753200	and our embryonic plan, our fetal plan, et cetera,
5753200	5757520	and our infant plan and the child plan
5757520	5759640	and the teenager plan and the adult plan,
5759640	5762560	if it's all in there for the cells,
5762560	5765120	then it's also in there for the software.
5765120	5766360	Why would it not be?
5766360	5768480	If the genome contains all of that,
5768480	5771840	then it probably also contains the ability
5771840	5775200	to read the associated software with it.
5775200	5777400	That is to say the software is a property
5777400	5782400	of the ensemble of the cells.
5782400	5784480	Yeah, well, I'd like to offer a thought.
5784480	5787440	I am an electrical engineer by training.
5787440	5791640	I've worked with circuits and also quite a bit with software.
5792880	5795240	This is nothing like hardware and software.
5795240	5797440	This is something different.
5797440	5800200	I think we can at the conceptual level
5800200	5803080	think about higher level controls,
5803080	5808080	but if you look at all the mechanisms
5808080	5811760	for synthesizing proteins for replication,
5812680	5815560	that's not hardware or software,
5815560	5819880	and bears a lot of thought.
5819880	5822120	I mean, there are some very high level,
5822120	5827120	long state machines in the biology.
5828880	5832080	So how this whole field pattern,
5833640	5836640	biological appearance communicates with that
5836640	5837680	is very interesting,
5837680	5841440	but I wouldn't oversimplify it with that comparison.
5842320	5843160	Good.
5844760	5846640	Can you hear me now?
5846640	5848280	Can we get rid of the slides?
5848280	5849120	Yes.
5850040	5852240	In a moment, can you hear me now?
5852240	5855680	Okay, because my expensive Yeti microphone cut off again,
5855680	5859360	so I guess I'll have to reinstall the drivers or something.
5859360	5864360	Robert had a really great question that brings us back.
5864600	5867440	So just how are we gonna use this to solve aging?
5867440	5869200	Does anyone have any ideas?
5871960	5875280	I was dropping in the chat a few of my thoughts there too.
5876280	5879320	Yeah, I think with this approach,
5879320	5882680	it just depends on how detailed your map is.
5882680	5887680	I mean, if you know with one electrical signal
5887680	5890040	that it would have a certain physiological,
5890040	5891840	biological response,
5891840	5895160	and you had that across every type of signal
5895160	5897320	and every type of response,
5897320	5899800	you could start rejuvenating entire organs
5899800	5902800	and in turn rejuvenating entire organ systems.
5903440	5907160	So yeah, and actually the target,
5907160	5909520	the target that I'm most interested in
5909520	5912960	is actually the circulatory system, right?
5912960	5914080	Like your cardiovascular
5914080	5916200	and then your musculatory organ system.
5916200	5917720	So it's really two,
5917720	5919600	and you really have to use it in combination
5919600	5923040	with other therapies because at the end of the day,
5923040	5925200	like someone was alluding to,
5925200	5928040	you have some hardware,
5928040	5929880	you have some hardware, whatever it is,
5929880	5933720	but how do the electrical signals detect?
5935160	5937200	How do you actually target specific things?
5937200	5940760	And it turns out that certain proteins in the body
5940760	5944360	can actually be like,
5944360	5946840	think about like within like photosynthesis, for example,
5946840	5948920	there's certain proteins and plants
5948920	5953200	that are using light to do some kind of chemical reaction.
5953200	5955640	And it turns out in the body, they're the similar thing.
5955640	5959080	So you essentially have to use like a combination
5960880	5965240	of peptides and other things with these frequencies
5965240	5968400	to be able to actually rejuvenate entire organ.
5968400	5972920	But that would be the approach that I would suggest.
5972920	5973760	Very good.
5973760	5976040	John Kramer had a question.
5976040	5979600	Yeah, it seems to me that the problem
5980480	5983560	of applying this to aging is that really you need a map
5983560	5987760	to decide which ion channels need to be open and closed
5987760	5990000	in order to produce given effects.
5990000	5994360	There may be, if we're lucky, there may be an ion channel
5994360	5996680	that you can open that sort of causes the whole body
5996680	6000120	to go into an anti-age or age reversal situation.
6000120	6003320	So this really needs to be studied in great detail.
6003320	6006040	And I'm pleased to hear from what he said
6006040	6009440	that there are a large number of drugs
6009440	6010560	that are now being developed,
6010560	6012560	which have effects on ion channels.
6012560	6016560	And so one needs to sort of cross correlate those drugs
6016560	6018520	with the effects that they have in order to find out
6018520	6020200	what's going on in mammals.
6020200	6024480	And apparently, plenaria are fine,
6024480	6027840	but they bear very little resemblance to us.
6027840	6031720	And so we really need a lot of experimentation,
6031720	6035520	apparently, investigation of what ion channels
6035520	6037280	do what in mammals.
6037280	6038680	And if we can do that,
6038680	6042760	we might make real progress towards dealing with aging.
6042760	6044600	Excellent.
6044600	6048680	Does anyone here not know how to raise your hand
6048680	6051240	with the little reactions?
6051240	6054040	I'm just trying to figure that out.
6054040	6056840	Okay, on the bottom,
6059200	6064200	if you move your cursor to the bottom of your Zoom screen,
6064200	6066840	it may be up already, it may pop up,
6066840	6071840	but you will see mute, stop video, some other things.
6072120	6074040	Now, farther to the right,
6074040	6078160	to the right of the green share screen is reactions.
6078160	6083160	If you hover over that, there is a raise hand.
6083360	6087560	That puts you to the front on my screen.
6088960	6093360	And okay, well.
6093360	6094440	You're not finding it.
6094440	6097120	Yeah, let's do this.
6097120	6099760	Miles had a question, then you.
6099760	6102600	And does anyone else not know how to do that?
6102600	6103760	There you go.
6103760	6105320	There you go.
6105320	6106880	Okay.
6106880	6108440	All right, I didn't hear that.
6108440	6112120	So just so we can take everyone in order
6112120	6115320	and everyone gets a turn, let's do it that way.
6115320	6117360	Miles, please.
6117360	6118240	Thank you.
6118240	6123240	Just to answer, John, John Cramer, the OSKM,
6125120	6128880	the Yamanaka Factors, they are combinatorial.
6128880	6130800	And if you remember the experiments,
6130800	6133360	Professor Yamanaka and all these collaborators
6133360	6137800	tried many combinations until they eat the right combination
6137800	6142240	which was extremely, it was an extreme reaction
6142240	6145240	from the embryo, the animal,
6145240	6147640	because it went right back to the embryonic state,
6147640	6149160	which was, this is radical.
6149160	6151960	I mean, normally, normal animals just don't do this.
6151960	6155200	So it was a needle in a stack,
6155200	6158760	and it was not easy there to try many, many combinations.
6158760	6161400	And I think the same thing is gonna happen here.
6161400	6163360	Something similar, you mentioned
6163360	6165280	that he's got a cocktail already.
6165280	6167520	I think that cocktail is fairly complex.
6167520	6170880	And as you get to higher up mammals and so forth,
6170880	6174880	I think that cocktail is more complex than for the worms.
6174880	6177920	So that's my comment on your comment.
6177920	6181480	The other one, Fiona, I also studied electrical engineering
6181480	6182760	and also chemical engineering,
6182760	6184920	the masters in chemical engineering.
6184920	6188680	What I think, I discovered
6188680	6190640	because I switched to chemical engineering,
6190640	6194680	I found our whole host of what you would call design motifs.
6194680	6196280	And I also call it design motifs.
6196280	6198920	I mean, you're familiar with, say, a transistor,
6198920	6200360	but as an electrical engineer,
6200360	6203040	you are not normally familiar
6203040	6206040	with a stranger tractor inside the embryo.
6206040	6208720	You're not familiar with the reaction diffusion equation
6208720	6211040	which determines that shape.
6211040	6214080	You're not familiar with the sort of other fields
6214080	6216480	which have different engineering motifs,
6216480	6217800	different designs.
6218680	6220640	What Dr. Levine did,
6220640	6223280	I think what you have to think about it in this way,
6223280	6226760	living organisms are not, they're very Catholic,
6226760	6228240	they use everything.
6228240	6231560	What he did, they combine electrical with chemical,
6231560	6235600	with mechanical in a very unorthodox way.
6235600	6236920	But what Dr. Levine did,
6236920	6239800	he took the electrical system by itself
6239800	6242200	and discovered that that's a control system,
6242200	6244880	which is, I think, very, very, very impressive.
6244880	6247640	The chemical system is still very complex
6247640	6251400	and a lot of it does not have electrical analogs.
6251400	6252840	There are things that happen in biology
6252840	6257840	which just don't translate into electrical motifs,
6258160	6262520	but at least the electrical control system
6262520	6265520	is now in view, like he's manipulating it.
6265520	6268960	He's not manipulating it with external fields,
6268960	6271200	he's actually using chemistry to manipulate it,
6271200	6272680	but it's still, because you can measure it,
6272680	6276200	he's got a voltage-sensitive dye.
6276200	6278240	So he's actually measuring the electrical fields
6278240	6279520	and he can see, for example, like you said,
6279520	6281160	he can see the face of the embryo
6281160	6283360	before the embryo forms the face.
6283360	6285840	So I think there's a lot of stuff around there
6285840	6288040	which is not electrical, it's very confusing sometimes.
6288040	6290840	I was like that, I still am a lot, a lot of times,
6290840	6293960	but at least we've taken the electrical system out
6293960	6296120	and we found that it's a control system.
6296120	6296960	Thank you.
6296960	6299800	Yeah, well, I know what you're saying.
6299800	6302000	It's enormously interesting
6302000	6305200	and I just don't wanna oversimplify it.
6305200	6307000	I don't think we fully understand,
6307000	6309640	and Michael would agree, and I talked to him before,
6310680	6314320	he doesn't fully understand and he will not claim to.
6314320	6317840	I mean, we're poking at things in the dark
6317840	6322320	and try and learn as a black box what we're doing here.
6322320	6324840	And I would also not, I mean,
6324840	6329040	I'm gonna paste a link here for a video on replication
6329160	6330640	and the whole thing that goes on.
6330640	6333800	It is completely mind-blowing too.
6333800	6338440	And there's very complex, very long,
6338440	6342120	intelligent state machines and subroutines
6342120	6343520	that you will see there.
6343520	6346320	And this is all new, a lot of it is new research.
6346320	6350720	When I took biochemistry even three years ago,
6350720	6354440	some of this stuff was not yet known, like histones.
6354440	6357200	I mean, a lot of it is recent.
6357200	6358680	And it's just mind-boggling.
6358680	6361600	And I just don't wanna say, well, this is hardware
6361600	6365280	because it has intelligence of its own.
6365280	6370040	And it is isolated to a cell, right?
6371480	6374160	So in a way, you could say there's a hierarchy
6374160	6377200	in what Michael is thinking is that
6377200	6379760	you can control not at the cell level,
6379760	6382920	you don't wanna be controlling at the genetic level.
6382920	6386840	And there's something very powerful there.
6387680	6392680	But I just don't think we can oversimplify it that way.
6395480	6398160	Well, there's a lot to figure out,
6398160	6399920	we need more time to do it.
6402000	6402840	Jeff?
6404160	6409160	Well, Dr. Levin seems to have really opened up
6410560	6412400	a whole new field of endeavor,
6413280	6416120	just scratching the surface.
6416120	6418680	You can look at all kinds of applications
6418680	6422520	to repair the damage of organs
6422520	6427160	and systems that occur during aging.
6427160	6431160	But ultimately, it seems like that approaches,
6431160	6433480	becomes the game of whack-a-mole,
6433480	6437400	where as you age, more and more things go wrong
6437400	6440160	and you can be repairing until that's all you're doing
6440160	6442120	is repairing this and that.
6442120	6446200	But because we are fundamentally programmed to age,
6446200	6449760	but yet there might be an opportunity with this technology
6449760	6451600	to change that program.
6451600	6453920	We keep coming back to this computer analogy,
6453920	6456960	but I think it is a good analogy
6456960	6460320	that this technology could possibly
6460320	6463200	just change the entire program where we do not,
6463200	6466400	you change the software so we do not age.
6472760	6476560	Well, let's work on it, let's do it.
6476560	6479240	That's the moonshot, as you would say.
6479240	6482480	Well, yeah, I think.
6482480	6485280	Yeah, I've got something to talk about.
6485280	6486880	You'll hear about it in a later meeting,
6486880	6491320	but let's see, Miles, you had another question.
6491320	6493880	Yeah, no, no, no, I just wanted to say,
6493880	6495520	yes, I agree with Jeff,
6495520	6497480	but I do believe in this combinational,
6497480	6500120	they're gonna search for the right combination.
6500120	6502080	And you're gonna see the same radical change
6502080	6504080	that you saw with the Amunaka factors,
6504080	6506280	which is completely unnatural.
6506280	6507960	So I expect that, Jeff.
6509480	6512200	The other question I want to make is just
6512200	6513640	that he's not alone anymore.
6513640	6515880	There's a big program at Harvard University.
6515880	6517640	You know, the nuclear program,
6517640	6521800	the venture capitalist are doing a big program
6521800	6525680	on bioelectricity, on bioelectric control,
6525680	6527840	as a response to his discovery.
6527840	6531240	So it's not as isolated as what we think.
6531240	6534880	There's actually money now going into this technology
6536000	6536840	as we speak.
6540800	6542200	Yeah, I was just gonna comment.
6542200	6543560	I agree with what you said, Miles.
6543560	6546280	It's a broad area of research
6546280	6549120	and commenting on your comment too, Jeff.
6549120	6554120	I think you're thinking about it sort of the right way
6554160	6555760	to some degree,
6555760	6558240	but with a slightly different flavor.
6558240	6560560	So it's not that we wouldn't age at all.
6560560	6563560	It's just we would have various tools
6563560	6568400	to enhance our resilience to effectively slow down
6568400	6571840	the aging process very dramatically,
6571840	6576840	while also augmenting ourselves to be much more resilient.
6576920	6580880	And then in turn, actually reversing damage.
6580880	6582360	Like it's slightly different.
6582360	6585080	Like you think about like the sense, you know,
6585080	6587880	Aubury degree, they always talk about like this damage,
6587880	6591840	but it's really like the repair mechanisms
6591840	6593520	that are not functioning correctly
6593520	6596960	or like the rejuvenation functions
6596960	6598480	that aren't resilient enough.
6598480	6602560	So I think we can augment those through these tools
6602560	6604760	would be kind of the way I was thinking of it.
6604760	6607840	And another short comment, you know,
6607840	6609240	I was thinking about what Fiona was saying
6609240	6612280	and I looked at that video and I tend to agree
6612280	6615520	there's so much complexity in the body.
6615520	6619200	But I think using like approach that Dr. Levin's using
6619200	6621040	sort of like a top down, you know,
6621040	6624840	if we can target specific organs and we can see,
6624840	6627560	I mean, the way he targeted like an arm to regrow
6627560	6629960	in some of these sample organisms, you know,
6629960	6633760	we may not understand some of the underlying biology
6633760	6636080	on the cellular level or even in the cells
6636080	6638440	and maybe still remain a mystery
6638440	6641140	even after we can rejuvenate entire organs.
6642600	6644520	You know, so I don't think we'll have to understand
6644520	6646560	like every single component
6646560	6649120	or even like the complete map I was describing,
6649120	6652160	I don't think we would have, at least not for a long time,
6652160	6654200	you know, okay, you have this frequency
6654200	6655720	or this electrical signal,
6655720	6657960	what does it do to each individual cell type?
6657960	6660520	Which, you know, we have thousands of cell types.
6660520	6663520	So that would be a much harder problem too.
6663520	6664520	Just a few thoughts.
6664520	6669520	We don't have to understand everything to work with it.
6674600	6678560	It's like we may not understand how we breathe completely,
6678560	6680600	but we breathe and we function.
6680600	6684480	So in that way, I'm a complete supporter of,
6684480	6687560	let's use that tool and all the other tools.
6689560	6692320	I agree, yeah, we have to understand it enough
6693160	6696640	to like alter it, for sure, I definitely agree.
6698000	6698840	I'll take it.
6698840	6702000	If there is a way you could, even if you don't understand,
6702000	6706320	you could do a pattern, a bioelectric pattern
6706320	6709720	and tell the body to go backwards and rejuvenate,
6709720	6711840	that's cool, right?
6711840	6714680	It's a little bit of a, well,
6715960	6719200	we can certainly keep learning that dimension.
6719200	6721800	Yeah, it's a star shot for sure, as Johnny would say.
6723320	6724160	Thank you.
6728960	6731760	Well, it's been a couple of hours.
6732680	6736280	This has been most rewarding.
6736280	6738480	As quickly as possible,
6738480	6741320	I'll get the recording up on the YouTube channel.
6741320	6745040	I don't know about you, but I'm gonna watch it a number
6745040	6747760	of times for all this to really sink in
6747760	6750360	and then take it to the next level.
6750360	6752680	How will we use this to solve aging?
6752680	6755160	And then, oh, little questions like,
6755160	6760000	how will we raise the money to use this to save aging?
6760000	6763480	And I have something I'm gonna reveal soon.
6763480	6766680	You will probably be among the first to see it.
6767640	6772640	So if you are going to the foresight frontiers
6774120	6776880	in longevity science, I think that's the name
6776880	6779280	of the conference in San Francisco.
6781400	6784840	I know, I believe Fiona, you'll be there.
6784840	6788480	It's April 17th and 18th.
6788480	6793480	You can't really get in now unless you become a sponsor,
6793920	6797520	but yeah, that's gonna be world-class.
6797520	6799520	So I'll look forward to seeing you there.
6802240	6806040	So unless there's any final, Jeff, final comments?
6807880	6811040	If people are interested in learning more
6811040	6816040	about Dr. Levin's work, of course, reading all of his papers,
6816560	6820840	but there are a number of much longer interviews on YouTube
6820840	6823840	than he, and he doesn't just give the same canned speech
6823840	6825040	over and over again.
6825040	6828080	He covers a lot of different ground
6828080	6831000	in his interviews that he gives.
6831000	6834760	So there's some other good videos to watch
6834880	6836680	if you want to see more of him.
6838640	6840240	You can search for him on YouTube.
6842200	6845040	So this was an outstanding thank you, Johnny,
6845040	6846480	for organizing this conference.
6846480	6847800	No, no, no, Miles.
6847800	6849120	It was fascinating.
6849120	6851240	I mean, I was at the edge of my seat.
6851240	6852520	Miles, thank you.
6852520	6853360	Thanks, Miles.
6853360	6854200	Very good.
6855440	6856440	Thank you, everyone.
6856440	6857280	Appreciate it, Miles.
6857280	6858120	Thanks, people.
6858120	6859720	Sorry for the date.
6859720	6862200	He's not available on Saturdays.
6863200	6866000	Me and Johnny had a lot of back and forth
6866000	6868560	trying to get him on a Saturday, but me.
6869560	6870400	It's so hard.
6870400	6871240	It's so hard.
6871240	6873120	It's breaking the schedule for that.
6873120	6873960	Sure, yeah.
6873960	6874800	Thank you very much.
6874800	6875640	Thank you very much.
6875640	6876480	Much worth it.
6877560	6878960	Okay, thanks, everyone.
6878960	6881160	This has been a great morning.
6881160	6884240	We're all off to a great Friday and a great weekend.
6884240	6885400	So thank you.
6885400	6886680	See you next time.
