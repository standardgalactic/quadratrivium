1. **Ease of Programming**: You've already done some programming in BASIC and LOGO, and you're interested in even simpler languages. Smalltalk is an emerging system that is easy to use and will be available on microcomputers. It's designed for personal computing with both software and hardware developments being made.

2. **Accessibility**: Computers are not just for numerical calculations or text presentation; they can handle multimedia content, including graphics and sounds. The Palo Alto Research Center is working on making computers accessible to people without deep technical knowledge by providing intuitive interfaces.

3. **Visual Interface**: A key development is the division of the computer display into windows, allowing users to browse through information in a way similar to exploring a library. This browsing can be done without precisely defining what you want, thus offering a more exploratory and less intimidating experience.

4. **Browser Window**: The browser is a window on the screen that's divided into sections, each representing a path to different pieces of information. Users can navigate this interface using a mouse, which moves a cursor around the screen and allows for selecting items with a button click.

5. **Incremental Changes and Exploration**: The programming language should support incremental changes so that users can make small adjustments without fear of breaking the system or losing their work. This encourages exploration and creativity within the computer environment.

6. **Reducing Fear**: By making the computing experience less daunting and more intuitive, the goal is to reduce the fear associated with computers, thereby encouraging more people to use them for a wide range of applications beyond just numerical or text-based tasks.

In summary, the discussion revolves around the evolution of programming languages and interfaces that are user-friendly, multimedia capable, and designed to encourage exploration without the fear of making mistakes. Smalltalk represents a step forward in this direction, and the development of graphical user interfaces with windows, browsers, and mouse input is a significant part of making computers more accessible to the general public.
