0	2400	I love video games.
2400	7400	They've been my main hobby for most of my life, and now I make videos about video games, which is great.
7400	10900	But recently, I've been analysing new games and critiquing new systems,
10900	16200	and I've noticed a slow but insidious trend toward games becoming more and more monetised,
16200	18600	but not fairly monetised.
18600	20600	Anti-player monetised.
20600	25500	It's the feeling you get when you look at a battle pass in a game you've already paid full price for.
25500	31500	It's the tiny slither of sadness when a game you want has different exclusive levels for different consoles,
31500	35200	and you'll know you'll never get to experience every part of that game now.
35200	42200	It's that cosmetic you want, costing 1,005 gems, but the gems are sold in packs of 1,004.
42200	48200	It's the knowledge that year on year, the microtransactions from FIFA Ultimate Team alone make more money
48200	50700	than Elden Ring's entire sale run.
50700	55300	It's the unfortunate reality of gaming after the marketing executives took over.
55300	59900	And it's hard to explain exactly how or when it changed, but explaining things is what I do.
59900	63800	So let's go back to the start of gaming and work out when this whole mess started.
63800	71200	And then I'll actually pinpoint the exact thing, the specific design choice, which makes new games feel wrong.
71200	72500	Welcome, I'm Josh Drivehays.
72500	75600	Let's work out what the hell went wrong with the monetisation of gaming.
75600	80700	As usual, a massive thank you to all the supporters on Patreon, Twitch and YouTube who keep the channel alive.
80700	83000	More information on how you can support at the end.
83000	84400	For now, let's begin.
84400	87300	Let's go back to the 1980s and early 1990s.
87300	92600	The video game revolution was kicking off, but home consoles weren't yet mainstream, so we went to arcades.
92600	98200	You put your money in and played a game, effectively making arcades the socially accepted pay-to-play model.
98200	100500	There's no denying arcades were bloody expensive.
100500	105200	I remember dropping way more than I should have done to complete Time Crisis, but while this was expensive,
105200	109100	there was a very simple relationship between the game, the money and the player.
109100	111000	Pay money, get access to the whole game.
111000	112600	Victory depends on your skill.
112600	114900	Game designers knew it was a simple transaction,
114900	117500	and they knew someone would simply play as long as they were able to,
117500	121700	so they had to make the game hard so you would die more, and so pay more.
121700	124100	This is why the Turtles game had that underwater bit.
124100	126600	It's why House of the Dead bosses were damage sponges.
126600	130500	It's why Ghosts and Goblins was everything that Ghosts and Goblins is.
130500	133400	In the early days of home consoles, when people would rent games,
133400	137700	we even called difficult levels blockbuster levels designed to make the rental period longer,
137700	139400	and so you'd have to keep renewing it.
139400	143800	So why don't these money-hungry games make us feel the same way as modern money-hungry games?
143800	146700	Well, it's because the trade of money for game was simple,
146700	149600	and there was nothing insidious about the transaction itself.
149600	153000	You knew what you were giving, and you knew what you were getting.
153000	157700	And if you were to break down the design time of a game into a pie chart at that point,
157700	159800	it might look something like this.
159800	163800	Story, graphics, narrative connections between them, mechanics, marketing, playtesting,
163800	166200	and then how much a go at the arcade costs.
166200	168800	There was a lot going on in the development of a game at these times,
168800	171500	but it's all focused on making a game good,
171500	175400	because at that time, good games make the most money.
175400	177500	When a company discovered a successful game,
177500	181500	they couldn't just augment the original with downloadable content or extra levels
181500	183400	because that technology didn't exist yet.
183400	187500	They'd have to make a complete sequel, and so gamers got more games.
187500	189100	Jump forward to the mid-1990s.
189100	190700	The home console market had taken off.
190700	193300	You buy a console, you buy a game, and then you play that game.
193300	196700	Now, the whole lives mechanic in games at this time
196700	199100	was a holdover from the arcade design space
199100	201800	and wasn't actually needed in home consoles
201800	204600	because you didn't need the player to put more money in.
204600	207800	Dying when you have three lives, then restarting from your last save,
207800	211500	or just dying and restarting from the save anyway with no arbitrary life limit
211500	215100	was functionally the same thing, but design moves slowly.
215100	218000	Away from the arcade model, you no longer paid per play,
218000	221300	and you now paid per game, and you then played as much as you wanted.
221300	225000	Games were expensive, of course, but when you bought a game, it was complete.
225100	227900	If it shipped with bugs, it would just have bugs forever.
227900	231200	If it shipped with secret unlockable stuff, it would have that forever.
231200	235100	When you owned the game, you owned the ability to play as much as you want
235100	239400	of the complete experience, and this was a very simple and fair transaction.
239400	242600	While the arcade was, here's a game, pay us to have a go,
242600	245900	the console was, here's a game, pay us to keep it and play it whenever.
245900	249000	But the home gaming scene wasn't just consoles, it was also PCs.
249000	252000	Now, back then PC gaming wasn't as mainstream as it is today,
252000	253900	but it did come with one major advantage.
253900	256700	Because the PC held a load of data files on its hard drive,
256700	259900	instead of just reading them from the disk or cart like a console,
259900	263700	developers could create additional content for a game and sell that.
263700	267100	Like the incredible RPG Balder's Gate, releasing in 1998,
267100	271200	and then the multi-hour-long expansion Tales of the Sword Coast in 1999.
271200	274300	This was a time in gaming where developers could develop additional content,
274300	277100	but when they did, it was usually a lot of content.
277100	279500	PC games saw expansion after expansion,
279500	282300	Morrowind seeing the tribunal and Blood Moon expansions,
282300	284900	Diablo 2, then the Lord of Destruction expansion,
284900	287700	and all the extra modules for Neverwinter Nights.
287700	291100	This was additional content for a game without being a sequel.
291100	295400	But again, gamers didn't hate this because the transaction was very simple to understand,
295400	296600	and it felt fair.
296600	303700	You gave them money, you got an experience designed to be the most fun it could possibly be.
303700	306500	The biggest difference in this era is there's no trickery.
306500	310400	You're not being manipulated, it's just a straight-up understandable product.
310400	314600	If we again take the idea of breaking down game development time into a pie chart,
314600	317200	you've probably got a few new bits to the pie by now.
317200	322500	Magazine adverts and articles, some TV ads, and the arcade price replaced with a box price.
322500	324100	But it is still mostly,
324100	325600	make a good game,
325600	327200	and you will make good money.
327200	330200	Then in 2004, online gaming really started to kick off,
330200	331900	with World of Warcraft being released,
331900	336100	but Blizzard aren't the bad guys in this story, at least not yet.
336100	337700	For now, we need to look to the east,
337700	341300	to another popular online game from Korea called Maple Story.
341300	345500	Now in Japan, the small toy-captuals Gachapon had been popular for years.
345500	350000	You put money into a Gachapon machine and get a random toy of varying rarity.
350000	352400	These systems appeal to people who like collecting things,
352400	354900	and people who like random chants or mystery.
354900	358200	It's basically gambling on a rather inconsequential level,
358200	361400	but the psychology behind it is very, very powerful.
361400	364800	So Maple Story introduced an in-game Gachapon-style system.
364800	368300	100 yen got you a ticket for a random in-game item,
368300	373700	and many people consider this to be the first example of a random loot box.
373700	377700	But more importantly, this was the first moment in mainstream video games
377700	382800	where you could pay money and not know what you were getting.
382800	385800	You were no longer paying for the game, or for an established product,
385800	387500	you were paying for the mystery.
387500	392300	The ephemeral moment of what if between purchase and eventual prize.
392300	394800	And this system made a lot of money.
394800	399500	Because Maple Story was online, and other people could see what you want.
399500	402600	So it was no longer about having the game and enjoying the game,
402600	405500	it was now about a sense of community and prestige
405500	407800	when you have something somebody else doesn't.
407800	411500	If you make your game multiplayer, competition amongst players becomes a thing,
411500	415900	and there are a subset of players who enjoy being seen as the person with the best stuff.
415900	418100	And unlike real Gachapon machines,
418100	420200	which were either a physical distance to travel to,
420200	422700	or had a queue by them, or sometimes just sold out,
422700	424900	virtual Gachapon tickets were unlimited,
424900	428900	entirely within the company's control, and could be bought constantly.
428900	431100	Maple Story already had the in-game items made,
431100	433300	so they were selling the excitement of chance,
433300	438900	and they were tapping into the collector and completionist mentality of many hardcore gamers.
438900	444000	So game developers began to see they didn't actually need to sell a gaming experience anymore.
444000	448600	They could instead sell the small adrenaline spike of potential.
448600	449800	This was a turning point.
449800	455900	A moment investors realised it was completely worthwhile to dedicate at least some game development time,
455900	460300	not to the game itself, but to systems within the game,
460300	465100	designed simply to extract money from the player after they had started playing,
465100	467600	but without giving them a complete new game.
467600	470600	This is the first part of the puzzle for where we are today.
470600	475000	So let's put this idea of sell random chance into a little box.
475000	479400	A box of all the design tricks which don't favour the player,
479400	482200	or make the game necessarily any better.
482200	484500	A box of design tricks which don't make you think,
484500	487500	oh my god, this is amazing, I need to tell all my friends,
487500	493200	but instead use the game as a simple vehicle for additional monetisation.
493200	496400	Now the techniques in this box are not games themselves.
496400	498200	They cannot exist on their own.
498200	503100	They aren't symbiotic with a game because they don't enhance each other.
503100	508400	They are parasitic because they need the game to survive but don't necessarily improve it.
508400	511700	We'll call this box Abusive Monetisation Strategies,
511700	514700	or from Orcatchy title Pandora's Box of Bad Design.
514700	519300	The main danger of this box is, if we were to take the pie chart of game development time now,
519300	524300	knowing that this box exists and knowing the techniques inside it can make a decent amount of money,
524300	532300	the finance people know they need to find space for the techniques within this box somewhere on the pie chart,
532300	535400	which means something else must lose out.
535400	537500	Jump forward two years to 2006.
537500	542300	The western gaming market hasn't yet discovered the mass appeal and psychological dominance that loot boxes have,
542300	545100	but they have discovered something just as important.
545100	551600	Gamers will pay money to look different, and it all kicks off with this stupid horse.
551700	553900	Now, I've made a complete video on the history of this horse,
553900	558700	but the short story is the Elder Scrolls Oblivion was a great game with some great DLC,
558700	560800	Knights of the Nine and the Shivering Isles.
560800	564000	But you could also pay a few dollars to give your horse armor.
564000	567000	Now, it's important to understand this is completely cosmetic.
567000	572200	It doesn't actually make your horse any better in combat or defend it, but you can buy it.
572200	573100	And people did.
573100	576300	In fact, a lot of people bought it, and this highlighted another thing.
576300	579500	Making a game takes a long time, but once the main game is made,
579500	584100	the development time it would take to make a cosmetic for that game is relatively short.
584100	589900	And that cosmetic can be sold for a small amount of money, but it can be sold many, many times.
589900	595600	The cost is micro, but the sales volume is high, hence microtransaction.
595600	601000	Separate from the idea of a complete expansion, which would expand the game and make the game experience bigger,
601000	605600	a microtransaction adds hardly anything beyond the original experience.
605600	608700	It's almost inconsequential, but it's not free.
608700	615000	So now developers know, expansions are a bit risky, but microtransactions are very safe and very small.
615000	618100	Even if they don't sell, it's not a great waste of developer time.
618100	623900	So the focus shifted away from selling a main game with lots of expansions to selling the main game
623900	628200	and then lots and lots and lots and lots of small, additional things.
628200	633200	The problem with this is now developers had a vested interest in keeping the coolest cosmetics
633200	639500	or the most fun little things out of the base game and instead releasing them as additional microtransactions,
639500	641300	which is something we'll see happen more and more.
641300	644400	And this absolutely does not favour the player.
644400	648500	Because it leads to an experience where you as a player, even though you have bought the game,
648500	653200	when you sit down to play it, you do not feel like you have access to the whole game, because you don't.
653200	655300	It used to be you bought a game and got a game.
655300	661100	Now it's you buy a game and you get the main framework, which you need to pay more to flesh out.
661100	668300	So let's add sell small additions to your game as microtransactions to the box of abusive monetization strategies.
668300	674700	And as the box grows, so does the space it would need to take up on the game development pie.
674700	682300	Now we head into 2009 to the rise of Facebook and one of the cornerstones of casual gaming and monetization progression, Farmville.
682300	687500	Farmville was everywhere in the late 2000s, made by Zynga, and these guys were masters.
687500	693400	Because Facebook was everywhere, everyone was on it, and even non-gamers were gaming, which sounds great.
693400	695700	But they were burning through the game too quickly.
695700	701100	They were enjoying it and then just moving on, which was not great, because Facebook is all about retention.
701100	705100	So Farmville did something really counterintuitive to increase player retention.
705100	709500	They gave you daily energy, so you couldn't progress more than a certain amount every day.
709500	714300	Now these games were mostly played by people on phones and laptops, and people got bored pretty quickly.
714300	718500	And one of the best ways to prevent boredom is to limit your time with something.
718500	721100	Absence makes the heart grow fonder, as they say.
721100	729400	So energy systems limiting what actions you could take, or timers connected to growing your crops or building things and you couldn't progress them quicker.
729400	736500	By making the player progress only in short but intense bursts and then wait for their next fix of game,
736500	743100	you either force them to pay more money to gain more energy or to skip the timers, or you make them return tomorrow.
743200	748200	And this is game design focused on the formation of daily habits.
748200	751500	The psychological power of the habit has been studied for years.
751500	759700	Motivational speakers talk about themself health books, push them and now gaming companies were looking to use them as a way to turn players into users.
759700	762100	Because it wasn't just about the game being fun anymore.
762100	767300	The focus wasn't on giving the player the best experience you could give them and letting the player enjoy it at their own pace.
767300	774300	The focus was about the game being effective at encouraging a specific behavior response from the user.
774300	778000	Encouraging the user to return day after day is habit forming.
778000	784700	Someone who plays your game habitually is more likely to remain playing even after the game itself has stopped being enjoyable.
784700	786500	They're just continuing the habit.
786500	793300	Along with this, game designers knew you would also have friends on Facebook that may not be playing the game and they wanted those friends to play the game.
793300	799600	Which is why they put the mechanics in the game of share this achievement with your friend to get bonuses and get boosts.
799600	804400	A huge amount of people began playing Facebook games not because they thought they would be the type of game they enjoy,
804400	807700	but because they were doing their friend a favor by starting up.
807700	809200	They were supporting their farm.
809200	810800	They were joining their mafia.
810800	816300	And just like MapleStory's Gacha being viewed by the players in the game, you could share the progress of your farm.
816300	820300	You could show off how far along you were, which spurred competition.
820300	828200	So we can add limiting progression per day and encouraging you to invite your friends to start the game to give yourself advantages,
828200	831600	or the ability to share your progression with the community.
831600	835600	Which is why achievements on almost all consoles and PCs are publicly viewable.
835600	839000	Into the box of abusive monetization strategies.
839000	842800	And while habitually playing something isn't generating money in itself,
842800	848600	it does keep the audience around longer so they can be exposed to other, more successful strategies.
848600	852300	Now some people will point out that paying to advance more or paying to skip timers
852300	858100	is in some ways similar to the old arcade process of dying and then putting more coins in to continue.
858100	861100	And it is similar, but there is a crucial difference.
861100	865800	With an arcade game, you could in theory finish the game entirely on skill.
865800	872200	These timers and energy bars in games such as Farmville cannot ever be finished on skill alone,
872200	877600	because you will hit a wall that you will need to either wait for or pay to remove.
877600	880700	But this wasn't everything. Nowhere near. Farmville had other strategies.
880700	885100	You had timers and you could pay to make them progress faster, but not with money directly.
885100	890400	Now you had to convert real money into a proprietary currency. In this case, Farmbox.
890400	896800	And this is one of the most prevalent designs we still see used, because it does several psychological things disgustingly well.
896800	901800	If you can buy something directly from a game, you can see the cost in a currency that you understand.
901800	909300	But if the game displays items in their own proprietary currency, such as gems or coins or platinum or Farmbox or whatever they want to call it,
909300	915300	you have to make one mental step converting the currency from what you understand to what you don't understand.
915300	922100	So all these things are now one mental step away from having real value, and that is hugely important.
922100	925300	Because even one step is further than most people are willing to go.
925300	932900	So let's add that into the box. Proprietary in-game premium currency to obscure real world value by a single step.
932900	939600	Bonus points if it makes you convert the currency to multiple other in-game currencies, which is almost completely impossible to track in your own mind.
939600	941800	So you need to buy the currency. And this is the next trick.
941800	948200	The currency is usually sold in packs, and these packs are specifically sized to either be just under what you actually need,
948200	952500	or very, very close to the next best thing, making you consider the next pack up.
952500	962400	For example, if you need 100 gems to buy something in the game and gem packs are sold in packs of 90 or 205, you may as well buy the 205 pack.
962400	969600	But then there's a really good item in the game for 210, and you're only five gems short, but the next pack contains 500 gems.
969600	974700	But there's a mega item for 505 gems, and you're only five gems shy of that now.
974700	979900	You're not thinking about the number 505, you're thinking it's only five and then only another five.
980000	984500	Much smaller jumps for much higher jumps in value.
984500	989000	You'd be a fool if you didn't take them, right? So that's going in the box of bad design.
989000	990400	But let's say you do buy a pack.
990400	995700	Whatever pack you buy, you will spend your unique in-game proprietary currency, but then you'll discover something else.
995700	999400	The currency is non-refundable, and it is almost impossible to spend all of it.
999400	1003400	You'll always be left with some random number, like four gems or two bits of platinum.
1003400	1009300	It's never zero, and this will bother you, because in your mind, that's a waste, and you don't like waste.
1009300	1012400	And if you don't spend that currency, then the game is keeping it, and you've paid for that.
1012400	1015500	But the only way to make this useful is to buy another currency pack.
1015500	1018100	I mean, you'd be a fool if you didn't do that, right?
1018100	1022000	You can't have premium currency just sitting there in strange, unspendable amounts.
1022000	1026000	It's annoying, and it's by design, so add that to the box.
1026000	1028100	But maybe you know all this, and you're not a fool.
1028100	1032000	You won't spend a lot, you wait for a sale, but oh look, you're a brand new player, and there's an offer.
1032000	1034700	A load of premium currency, a boost, a few cosmetics.
1034700	1038700	It's a limited time offer, and it's all for the low price of just under a dollar.
1038800	1041100	Now, you'd definitely be a fool if you didn't buy this.
1041100	1046300	If you've ever wondered why the intro packs to almost any game are such good value,
1046300	1053000	it's because studies have shown people who buy a single purchase are much, much more likely to make another purchase.
1053000	1055700	So you want to make the first purchase really enticing.
1055700	1060200	And it's because some phones need you to authorise in-app purchases.
1060200	1065100	But once you've authorised one, it will not double-check for any extra purchases.
1065100	1069800	So you confirm that you want to buy the cheap pack, and then it doesn't double-check for the expensive packs.
1069800	1075100	Because every screen between the player and a purchase is a moment they could doubt and reconsider.
1075100	1080600	So you want to get those, are you sure you want to purchase this, checks, agreed with, and out the way, early.
1080600	1084600	Unusually cheap intro microtransactions just to get you into a habit.
1084600	1085800	Let's add that to the box.
1085800	1090900	And while the box is looking pretty anti-player and anti-consumer so far, it's nowhere near full.
1090900	1099500	To truly see how effective this ugly design can be, we only need to go forward one year to 2010 and look at FIFA's Ultimate Team mode.
1099500	1105000	Now, I'm not really into football games, but the FIFA franchise of games actually highlights the game design shift really well.
1105000	1114300	It shows how games have moved from being a fun experience by themselves to a fun enough framework that other monetisation tactics will cling to like limpets.
1114300	1119600	In FIFA, you can buy loot boxes which contain random cards of players and use these to build up your Ultimate Team.
1119600	1123300	The Ultimate Team mode takes several of the box ideas and combines them.
1123300	1129000	And now the Ultimate Team mode makes more money than the box sales of FIFA itself.
1129000	1137200	In fact, since 2018, FIFA Ultimate Team has generated over $1 billion in revenue per year for EA.
1137200	1140500	In 2021, they made $1.6 billion.
1140500	1142900	And it happens every single year.
1142900	1149300	And the cards you buy in the Ultimate Team for one year cannot be used in the next year, meaning the microtransactions now have a shelf life.
1149400	1152000	Horse armour may last forever, but what if it didn't?
1152000	1155400	What if you could make a player pay for it again and again every year?
1155400	1159200	Let's add that to the box, yearly repeating microtransactions.
1159200	1162600	Now, as a developer, you'd look at this thing, this box and think,
1162600	1166300	wow, selling my game isn't the profitable thing anymore.
1166300	1168800	It's what I can sell within the game.
1168800	1176600	By now, the box of abusive monetisation strategies is so big, it's almost impossible to ignore if you are making a game.
1176600	1180400	One year later in 2011, the MMORPG RuneScape is suffering.
1180400	1186500	They had a major update to the combat system, which a huge majority of the player base hated and this made them lose a lot of players.
1186500	1193300	This is a mistake worthy of its own video, but the bottom line is they are a monthly subscription game, losing subscribing players.
1193300	1198700	And they need to find a way to either recover paying members or to stem the tide of people leaving.
1198700	1200500	Enter the loyalty programme.
1200500	1207000	Every month of membership, you now earn loyalty points and you earn more for every consecutive month that you remain subscribed.
1207000	1213600	And then you can spend loyalty points on cool exclusive cosmetics or mechanically powerful auras and boosts.
1213600	1217000	So now, cancelling your membership wasn't just a case of thinking,
1217000	1222700	I'm not enjoying the game, so I won't pay, which is a very simple understandable fair transaction.
1222700	1228500	It's now a case of thinking, I'm not enjoying the game, but if I unsubscribe, I break my loyalty streak
1228500	1234800	and will earn far fewer loyalty points over the long run, which will put me at a disadvantage if I ever do want to come back in the future.
1234800	1237300	Which is not as fair.
1237300	1242900	The transaction used to be simple, but now we're putting the player in the position of give money even if you don't want to play,
1242900	1245600	because you don't want to break a habit, that's going in the box.
1245600	1250400	And by now, the box is demanding a bigger and bigger slice of the game design pie chart.
1250400	1256100	Two years later, 2013 sees the release of Dead Space 3, the third installment in a terrific horror trilogy.
1256100	1256900	Well, sort of.
1256900	1262300	While Dead Space 1 and 2 were indeed terrific horror games with tension and pacing and balanced gameplay and great stories,
1262300	1264100	Dead Space 3 did something strange.
1264100	1270100	It took the idea of you being a lone engineer trapped on an infested spaceship, struggling against incredible odds,
1270100	1274500	using only your small collection of mining tools and very limited ammunition to survive,
1274500	1281000	and it added in the ability to let you buy in-game guns with real cash from the cash shop.
1281000	1286100	A horror survival game selling you in-game guns and ammo,
1286100	1290000	completely defeating the atmosphere and vibe the game was going for.
1290000	1293600	Selling players things they could use within your game to make the game easier.
1293600	1296500	Let's add that to the box, that's effectively selling power.
1296500	1299100	This one manages to out-monetize even the arcade.
1299100	1305000	It would be like putting more coins into Time Crisis and getting a rocket launcher, or removing the time limit in Crazy Taxi.
1305000	1308200	It sort of defeats the purpose of the original game.
1308200	1315900	Along with Dead Space selling guns, we now see the MOBA game Dota 2 release what many consider the first major Battle Pass system.
1315900	1321100	Now, when this craze started, I remember walking into gaming shops and seeing the phrase Battle Pass everywhere,
1321100	1323300	and I had no idea what they were.
1323300	1332400	Effectively, they are optional purchasers, which unlock a series of challenges or processes you can go through to unlock more stuff in the game,
1332400	1334100	but they are time-sensitive.
1334100	1338900	So you buy the monthly Battle Pass, and if you play a certain number of hours or kill a certain number of enemies
1338900	1344900	or achieve a certain number of whatever it wants you to do, you can advance along the Battle Pass and unlock new stuff.
1344900	1349500	Now, you could just have the unlockable stuff be available for everyone to unlock anyway,
1349500	1353500	but by limiting it to a timed Battle Pass, you're doing a few manipulative things.
1353500	1356200	You're creating a fear of missing out, or FOMO.
1356200	1362200	As players know, if they don't have this month's Battle Pass, they may never get the full experience or that rare cosmetic ever again.
1362200	1368200	So you are encouraging an unhealthy amount of gameplay, because if you're not advancing your Battle Pass, you're losing precious time.
1368200	1374800	So now you're actually discouraging players from enjoying any other game and forcing them to focus entirely on progression within yours.
1374800	1381000	This design is, of course, at odds with the limit playtime technique, because they appeal to different demographics.
1381000	1386500	Remember, a Battle Pass or limited-time progression track doesn't always actively improve a game,
1386500	1391000	but it does always increase that game's revenue, so throw it in the box.
1391000	1400500	By now, even the concept of a fun, well-made game is starting to look like a horrifically augmented shadow of its former self.
1400500	1407300	Imagine what a well-made game would look like if you tried to shoehorn in all of the techniques in this box.
1407300	1411000	And unfortunately, eventually, you won't need to imagine. We're seeing it more and more.
1411000	1416700	Later that same year, one of my favourite games comes out, Assassin's Creed Black Flag, a fantastic pirate game.
1416700	1424400	There's just one problem. Unless you own both a PlayStation and an Xbox and are willing to buy two copies of the game, you can never experience the full game.
1424400	1431000	Black Flag featured console-exclusive levels, which not only fuelled the petty console wars,
1431000	1439600	but also highlighted the fact that marketing executives were now powerful enough to tell game developers exactly what their players deserved,
1439600	1443500	or, more importantly, what their non-players don't deserve.
1443500	1445900	This is not player-focused design at all.
1445900	1452700	And while I completely understand the power of console exclusives, when I walked into a game shop and picked up two copies of Black Flag and realised,
1452700	1458800	no matter what I choose, there is a mission I won't get to play because I don't have the right console, that didn't leave a good taste in my mouth.
1458800	1465900	So while Dota may have started the Battle Pass idea, it was almost perfected four years later in 2017 by Fortnite Season 2,
1465900	1469100	which replaced the season shop with a Battle Pass system.
1469100	1477000	And then later in November of 2017, we witness a bit of gaming history, and it fills us all with a sense of pride and accomplishment.
1477000	1483200	Star Wars Battlefront II was an amazing game which released back in 2005, not to be confused with Star Wars Battlefront II,
1483200	1485700	which was a mediocre game which released in 2017.
1485700	1491500	It was a full-price game and yet also had a loot box system in it, along with premium currency system.
1491500	1497200	This led to a Reddit user complaining that even though they'd bought the $80 deluxe version of the game,
1497200	1500600	they still couldn't play as Darth Vader from day one.
1500600	1507500	Unlocking Darth Vader means buying his hero crate, which costs 60,000 in-game credits, or you can spend real money.
1507500	1511800	Now, you can earn an average of 250 credits per 10-minute match at the time,
1511800	1518800	so you'd have to grind for roughly 40 hours of constant gameplay, longer than the average completion time of most video games,
1518800	1521500	to unlock a single rare character.
1521500	1525400	Or you could pay crystals in the premium shop and spend those on hero crates and just hope.
1525400	1527600	EA responded to this Reddit complaint saying,
1527600	1535100	The reason crates were so expensive or take so long to unlock is to give a sense of pride and accomplishment to players who did manage to unlock them.
1535100	1538600	This becomes the most down-voted comment in Reddit history.
1538600	1542800	So, locking premium parts of your full-priced game behind either hours of grind,
1542800	1547800	or spending even more money to unlock the cool stuff before other people who bought the same game as you.
1547800	1552900	Now, it's important to understand that games having things locked within them is not necessarily bad design.
1552900	1556400	One of my favorite games of all time is SSX Tricky, the snowboarding game.
1556400	1560100	And as you play through that, you unlock new characters, new boards, and new tracks.
1560100	1566300	Progression within a game, and rewarding that progression with new mechanics, new characters, and new areas, is not bad.
1566300	1570000	The problem was, progression wasn't the only way to unlock this.
1570000	1572700	You could simply pay more money to get it immediately.
1572700	1578900	And because it was a competitive game, people who paid the extra money were at an advantage over those who did not.
1578900	1582000	This is a video about how newer games feel wrong.
1582000	1588500	And it feels wrong to buy the same game as someone else, and to know that they will have an advantage over you if they pay more.
1588500	1592400	Throw that in the box of abusive monetization. Why not? It's going to work.
1592400	1595400	And then, five years later, Diablo Immortal happened.
1595400	1600800	Now, I've already covered Diablo Immortal pretty extensively in the video The Diabolically Immoral, Diablo Immortal,
1600800	1607100	and its follow-up about the legendary crests, because it took basically every idea from the big box of abusive monetization
1607100	1611000	and sprinkled them liberally over a somewhat Diablo-looking game,
1611000	1617300	including multiple premium currencies, a deliberately similar in-game item which functions slightly differently to a paid version of the same thing,
1617300	1620000	and multiple battle passes all called different things.
1620000	1623800	But don't worry, because everyone assured me that Diablo Immortal was a mobile game,
1623800	1629000	and thus would not be representative of the actual next Diablo game which would be Diablo IV.
1629000	1634500	Everyone told me Diablo IV would be a full game by itself, with no cash shop, with gameplay first,
1634500	1637400	and none of the strategies from the big box of badness.
1637400	1642900	So, of course, there are various digital versions of the game, the more expensive ones giving you an accelerated battle pass bonus,
1642900	1647600	allowing you to progress quicker, and there is a cosmetic cash shop using its own proprietary currency.
1647600	1654800	And if you're thinking Diablo doesn't need all these extra bells and whistles to be a good Diablo game, you are correct.
1654800	1660000	These have not been added because they make the game better, they've been added because they make the game money.
1660100	1664300	And then Darktide released, which is a full-price game, with an abusively priced cash shop.
1664300	1669700	Or you can grind for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours to get some of the cheap things in that shop.
1669700	1672100	And now we're here. So why have games become like this?
1672100	1674000	Simple, because games are businesses.
1674000	1679100	Games have been businesses since arcades, since consoles allowed you to buy the game and have it in your own home.
1679100	1680900	They have always wanted to make money.
1680900	1685200	But up until now, the best way to make the most amount of money was to make the best game you possibly could,
1685200	1688300	because people would buy it, and that was it, the transaction was finished.
1688400	1694500	It was fair. The best way to make money on modern games is to make the best framework as a holder for these strategies.
1694500	1698400	And companies have experimented with various methods to increase income over the years,
1698400	1704300	from gacha loot boxes to pre-orders, console exclusives to battle passes, energy systems to just straight-up selling power.
1704300	1710100	And instead of hiring game designers, they hired psychologists to build habits, to reinforce addictive behaviors,
1710100	1712700	to design gameplay loops which encourage spending.
1712700	1715900	The problem was these techniques were never about the player having fun.
1715900	1718400	They were about the user being monetized.
1718400	1723800	And when a marketing executive pictures you playing a game, you aren't pictured smiling and laughing with friends,
1723800	1727700	you're pictured opening your wallet and reaching for your credit card, because that's their goal.
1727700	1734700	And eventually, the Pandora's box of abusive monetization strategies was so full of proven, effective techniques
1734700	1739400	that making a game is often no longer about the game, at least not for the people in charge of the money.
1739400	1745300	The game is now simply a life support system for as many of these systems as you can design into it.
1745300	1752600	The game as a host and the parasite of monetization has begun to take over, and the unfortunate reality is this works.
1752600	1760700	Even with a breakout incredible success like Elden Ring, which won Game of the Year and sold over 18 million copies as of this video,
1760700	1765600	at $60 a sale, that's over a billion dollars in sales worldwide,
1765600	1772000	that is still slightly shy of how much money Genshin Impact made this year.
1772100	1779200	It is still shy of how much money FIFA Ultimate Team has made every year for the last four years.
1779200	1788600	The reality is, when companies look at that pie chart of game development time and how they divide developer time or invested money,
1788600	1795200	that big box of abusive monetization strategies, that Pandora's box of terribleness is so effective,
1795200	1800700	they would be hurting their own profit to not put at least some of the techniques in.
1800700	1807600	The older designers simply didn't have the knowledge of this box, and even if they did, they didn't have the technology to act on it at the time.
1807600	1815200	Modern design often puts the player into an awkward position where the game has spent more time focusing on the manipulative abusive systems
1815200	1819300	than it has on just being the best game it could be.
1819300	1824100	So what is the exact choice which makes games feel wrong?
1824100	1826600	Is it MapleStory's fault for adding Gachapon?
1826600	1828300	Is it Oblivion's fault for the horse armor?
1828300	1830600	Is it Dota's fault for the Battle Pass FIFA's fault?
1830600	1832200	For the success of Ultimate Team?
1832200	1834700	Is it Farmville's fault for mastering the addiction cycle?
1834700	1837400	Or is it EA's fault for locking away Darth Vader?
1837400	1839100	Unfortunately, it's kind of all of them.
1839100	1841100	It's just the reality of games designed today.
1841100	1843500	You cannot close the lid on Pandora's box.
1843500	1846900	Designers can't UNK know the effectiveness of these techniques.
1846900	1851800	And every game made for the rest of time has to either use them or actively choose to avoid them.
1851800	1858800	So the exact choice that makes a game go from being the best it can possibly be to anti-player or anti-consumer
1858800	1865700	is when a designer or a marketing executive stops thinking about how they can make the best game they're capable of
1865700	1869800	and starts throwing some sly glances toward the box in the corner.
1869800	1875400	And when they say, hey, this technique may not fit our game perfectly, but it's proven to make a lot of money.
1875400	1877600	Do you think we could put it in our game?
1877600	1879000	That is the moment.
1879000	1885400	Any specific game goes downhill from what it could be from a player's perspective.
1885400	1891300	And the worst part is that big evil box and all its dark design knowledge is constantly being added to.
1891300	1894900	And when you play a new game and spot the cash shop and the battle pass and the premium currency
1894900	1899800	and the awkward pack size and the loot boxes and the exclusive levels and when you just feel sad
1899800	1901900	that the game didn't have to do that,
1901900	1909500	that's when you know that the pie chart of design of this game had at least a small slice dedicated to that stupid box.
1909500	1914800	A small slice focused on making the game a little bit anti-player in the name of a lot of profit.
1914800	1919700	But personally, I also know it can be very cathartic to be angry at a thing instead of a concept.
1919700	1924400	So let's all just collectively agree to blame the stupid horse.
