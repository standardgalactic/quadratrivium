00:00.000 --> 00:02.400
I love video games.

00:02.400 --> 00:07.400
They've been my main hobby for most of my life, and now I make videos about video games, which is great.

00:07.400 --> 00:10.900
But recently, I've been analysing new games and critiquing new systems,

00:10.900 --> 00:16.200
and I've noticed a slow but insidious trend toward games becoming more and more monetised,

00:16.200 --> 00:18.600
but not fairly monetised.

00:18.600 --> 00:20.600
Anti-player monetised.

00:20.600 --> 00:25.500
It's the feeling you get when you look at a battle pass in a game you've already paid full price for.

00:25.500 --> 00:31.500
It's the tiny slither of sadness when a game you want has different exclusive levels for different consoles,

00:31.500 --> 00:35.200
and you'll know you'll never get to experience every part of that game now.

00:35.200 --> 00:42.200
It's that cosmetic you want, costing 1,005 gems, but the gems are sold in packs of 1,004.

00:42.200 --> 00:48.200
It's the knowledge that year on year, the microtransactions from FIFA Ultimate Team alone make more money

00:48.200 --> 00:50.700
than Elden Ring's entire sale run.

00:50.700 --> 00:55.300
It's the unfortunate reality of gaming after the marketing executives took over.

00:55.300 --> 00:59.900
And it's hard to explain exactly how or when it changed, but explaining things is what I do.

00:59.900 --> 01:03.800
So let's go back to the start of gaming and work out when this whole mess started.

01:03.800 --> 01:11.200
And then I'll actually pinpoint the exact thing, the specific design choice, which makes new games feel wrong.

01:11.200 --> 01:12.500
Welcome, I'm Josh Drivehays.

01:12.500 --> 01:15.600
Let's work out what the hell went wrong with the monetisation of gaming.

01:15.600 --> 01:20.700
As usual, a massive thank you to all the supporters on Patreon, Twitch and YouTube who keep the channel alive.

01:20.700 --> 01:23.000
More information on how you can support at the end.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.400
For now, let's begin.

01:24.400 --> 01:27.300
Let's go back to the 1980s and early 1990s.

01:27.300 --> 01:32.600
The video game revolution was kicking off, but home consoles weren't yet mainstream, so we went to arcades.

01:32.600 --> 01:38.200
You put your money in and played a game, effectively making arcades the socially accepted pay-to-play model.

01:38.200 --> 01:40.500
There's no denying arcades were bloody expensive.

01:40.500 --> 01:45.200
I remember dropping way more than I should have done to complete Time Crisis, but while this was expensive,

01:45.200 --> 01:49.100
there was a very simple relationship between the game, the money and the player.

01:49.100 --> 01:51.000
Pay money, get access to the whole game.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.600
Victory depends on your skill.

01:52.600 --> 01:54.900
Game designers knew it was a simple transaction,

01:54.900 --> 01:57.500
and they knew someone would simply play as long as they were able to,

01:57.500 --> 02:01.700
so they had to make the game hard so you would die more, and so pay more.

02:01.700 --> 02:04.100
This is why the Turtles game had that underwater bit.

02:04.100 --> 02:06.600
It's why House of the Dead bosses were damage sponges.

02:06.600 --> 02:10.500
It's why Ghosts and Goblins was everything that Ghosts and Goblins is.

02:10.500 --> 02:13.400
In the early days of home consoles, when people would rent games,

02:13.400 --> 02:17.700
we even called difficult levels blockbuster levels designed to make the rental period longer,

02:17.700 --> 02:19.400
and so you'd have to keep renewing it.

02:19.400 --> 02:23.800
So why don't these money-hungry games make us feel the same way as modern money-hungry games?

02:23.800 --> 02:26.700
Well, it's because the trade of money for game was simple,

02:26.700 --> 02:29.600
and there was nothing insidious about the transaction itself.

02:29.600 --> 02:33.000
You knew what you were giving, and you knew what you were getting.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.700
And if you were to break down the design time of a game into a pie chart at that point,

02:37.700 --> 02:39.800
it might look something like this.

02:39.800 --> 02:43.800
Story, graphics, narrative connections between them, mechanics, marketing, playtesting,

02:43.800 --> 02:46.200
and then how much a go at the arcade costs.

02:46.200 --> 02:48.800
There was a lot going on in the development of a game at these times,

02:48.800 --> 02:51.500
but it's all focused on making a game good,

02:51.500 --> 02:55.400
because at that time, good games make the most money.

02:55.400 --> 02:57.500
When a company discovered a successful game,

02:57.500 --> 03:01.500
they couldn't just augment the original with downloadable content or extra levels

03:01.500 --> 03:03.400
because that technology didn't exist yet.

03:03.400 --> 03:07.500
They'd have to make a complete sequel, and so gamers got more games.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.100
Jump forward to the mid-1990s.

03:09.100 --> 03:10.700
The home console market had taken off.

03:10.700 --> 03:13.300
You buy a console, you buy a game, and then you play that game.

03:13.300 --> 03:16.700
Now, the whole lives mechanic in games at this time

03:16.700 --> 03:19.100
was a holdover from the arcade design space

03:19.100 --> 03:21.800
and wasn't actually needed in home consoles

03:21.800 --> 03:24.600
because you didn't need the player to put more money in.

03:24.600 --> 03:27.800
Dying when you have three lives, then restarting from your last save,

03:27.800 --> 03:31.500
or just dying and restarting from the save anyway with no arbitrary life limit

03:31.500 --> 03:35.100
was functionally the same thing, but design moves slowly.

03:35.100 --> 03:38.000
Away from the arcade model, you no longer paid per play,

03:38.000 --> 03:41.300
and you now paid per game, and you then played as much as you wanted.

03:41.300 --> 03:45.000
Games were expensive, of course, but when you bought a game, it was complete.

03:45.100 --> 03:47.900
If it shipped with bugs, it would just have bugs forever.

03:47.900 --> 03:51.200
If it shipped with secret unlockable stuff, it would have that forever.

03:51.200 --> 03:55.100
When you owned the game, you owned the ability to play as much as you want

03:55.100 --> 03:59.400
of the complete experience, and this was a very simple and fair transaction.

03:59.400 --> 04:02.600
While the arcade was, here's a game, pay us to have a go,

04:02.600 --> 04:05.900
the console was, here's a game, pay us to keep it and play it whenever.

04:05.900 --> 04:09.000
But the home gaming scene wasn't just consoles, it was also PCs.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
Now, back then PC gaming wasn't as mainstream as it is today,

04:12.000 --> 04:13.900
but it did come with one major advantage.

04:13.900 --> 04:16.700
Because the PC held a load of data files on its hard drive,

04:16.700 --> 04:19.900
instead of just reading them from the disk or cart like a console,

04:19.900 --> 04:23.700
developers could create additional content for a game and sell that.

04:23.700 --> 04:27.100
Like the incredible RPG Balder's Gate, releasing in 1998,

04:27.100 --> 04:31.200
and then the multi-hour-long expansion Tales of the Sword Coast in 1999.

04:31.200 --> 04:34.300
This was a time in gaming where developers could develop additional content,

04:34.300 --> 04:37.100
but when they did, it was usually a lot of content.

04:37.100 --> 04:39.500
PC games saw expansion after expansion,

04:39.500 --> 04:42.300
Morrowind seeing the tribunal and Blood Moon expansions,

04:42.300 --> 04:44.900
Diablo 2, then the Lord of Destruction expansion,

04:44.900 --> 04:47.700
and all the extra modules for Neverwinter Nights.

04:47.700 --> 04:51.100
This was additional content for a game without being a sequel.

04:51.100 --> 04:55.400
But again, gamers didn't hate this because the transaction was very simple to understand,

04:55.400 --> 04:56.600
and it felt fair.

04:56.600 --> 05:03.700
You gave them money, you got an experience designed to be the most fun it could possibly be.

05:03.700 --> 05:06.500
The biggest difference in this era is there's no trickery.

05:06.500 --> 05:10.400
You're not being manipulated, it's just a straight-up understandable product.

05:10.400 --> 05:14.600
If we again take the idea of breaking down game development time into a pie chart,

05:14.600 --> 05:17.200
you've probably got a few new bits to the pie by now.

05:17.200 --> 05:22.500
Magazine adverts and articles, some TV ads, and the arcade price replaced with a box price.

05:22.500 --> 05:24.100
But it is still mostly,

05:24.100 --> 05:25.600
make a good game,

05:25.600 --> 05:27.200
and you will make good money.

05:27.200 --> 05:30.200
Then in 2004, online gaming really started to kick off,

05:30.200 --> 05:31.900
with World of Warcraft being released,

05:31.900 --> 05:36.100
but Blizzard aren't the bad guys in this story, at least not yet.

05:36.100 --> 05:37.700
For now, we need to look to the east,

05:37.700 --> 05:41.300
to another popular online game from Korea called Maple Story.

05:41.300 --> 05:45.500
Now in Japan, the small toy-captuals Gachapon had been popular for years.

05:45.500 --> 05:50.000
You put money into a Gachapon machine and get a random toy of varying rarity.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.400
These systems appeal to people who like collecting things,

05:52.400 --> 05:54.900
and people who like random chants or mystery.

05:54.900 --> 05:58.200
It's basically gambling on a rather inconsequential level,

05:58.200 --> 06:01.400
but the psychology behind it is very, very powerful.

06:01.400 --> 06:04.800
So Maple Story introduced an in-game Gachapon-style system.

06:04.800 --> 06:08.300
100 yen got you a ticket for a random in-game item,

06:08.300 --> 06:13.700
and many people consider this to be the first example of a random loot box.

06:13.700 --> 06:17.700
But more importantly, this was the first moment in mainstream video games

06:17.700 --> 06:22.800
where you could pay money and not know what you were getting.

06:22.800 --> 06:25.800
You were no longer paying for the game, or for an established product,

06:25.800 --> 06:27.500
you were paying for the mystery.

06:27.500 --> 06:32.300
The ephemeral moment of what if between purchase and eventual prize.

06:32.300 --> 06:34.800
And this system made a lot of money.

06:34.800 --> 06:39.500
Because Maple Story was online, and other people could see what you want.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.600
So it was no longer about having the game and enjoying the game,

06:42.600 --> 06:45.500
it was now about a sense of community and prestige

06:45.500 --> 06:47.800
when you have something somebody else doesn't.

06:47.800 --> 06:51.500
If you make your game multiplayer, competition amongst players becomes a thing,

06:51.500 --> 06:55.900
and there are a subset of players who enjoy being seen as the person with the best stuff.

06:55.900 --> 06:58.100
And unlike real Gachapon machines,

06:58.100 --> 07:00.200
which were either a physical distance to travel to,

07:00.200 --> 07:02.700
or had a queue by them, or sometimes just sold out,

07:02.700 --> 07:04.900
virtual Gachapon tickets were unlimited,

07:04.900 --> 07:08.900
entirely within the company's control, and could be bought constantly.

07:08.900 --> 07:11.100
Maple Story already had the in-game items made,

07:11.100 --> 07:13.300
so they were selling the excitement of chance,

07:13.300 --> 07:18.900
and they were tapping into the collector and completionist mentality of many hardcore gamers.

07:18.900 --> 07:24.000
So game developers began to see they didn't actually need to sell a gaming experience anymore.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.600
They could instead sell the small adrenaline spike of potential.

07:28.600 --> 07:29.800
This was a turning point.

07:29.800 --> 07:35.900
A moment investors realised it was completely worthwhile to dedicate at least some game development time,

07:35.900 --> 07:40.300
not to the game itself, but to systems within the game,

07:40.300 --> 07:45.100
designed simply to extract money from the player after they had started playing,

07:45.100 --> 07:47.600
but without giving them a complete new game.

07:47.600 --> 07:50.600
This is the first part of the puzzle for where we are today.

07:50.600 --> 07:55.000
So let's put this idea of sell random chance into a little box.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.400
A box of all the design tricks which don't favour the player,

07:59.400 --> 08:02.200
or make the game necessarily any better.

08:02.200 --> 08:04.500
A box of design tricks which don't make you think,

08:04.500 --> 08:07.500
oh my god, this is amazing, I need to tell all my friends,

08:07.500 --> 08:13.200
but instead use the game as a simple vehicle for additional monetisation.

08:13.200 --> 08:16.400
Now the techniques in this box are not games themselves.

08:16.400 --> 08:18.200
They cannot exist on their own.

08:18.200 --> 08:23.100
They aren't symbiotic with a game because they don't enhance each other.

08:23.100 --> 08:28.400
They are parasitic because they need the game to survive but don't necessarily improve it.

08:28.400 --> 08:31.700
We'll call this box Abusive Monetisation Strategies,

08:31.700 --> 08:34.700
or from Orcatchy title Pandora's Box of Bad Design.

08:34.700 --> 08:39.300
The main danger of this box is, if we were to take the pie chart of game development time now,

08:39.300 --> 08:44.300
knowing that this box exists and knowing the techniques inside it can make a decent amount of money,

08:44.300 --> 08:52.300
the finance people know they need to find space for the techniques within this box somewhere on the pie chart,

08:52.300 --> 08:55.400
which means something else must lose out.

08:55.400 --> 08:57.500
Jump forward two years to 2006.

08:57.500 --> 09:02.300
The western gaming market hasn't yet discovered the mass appeal and psychological dominance that loot boxes have,

09:02.300 --> 09:05.100
but they have discovered something just as important.

09:05.100 --> 09:11.600
Gamers will pay money to look different, and it all kicks off with this stupid horse.

09:11.700 --> 09:13.900
Now, I've made a complete video on the history of this horse,

09:13.900 --> 09:18.700
but the short story is the Elder Scrolls Oblivion was a great game with some great DLC,

09:18.700 --> 09:20.800
Knights of the Nine and the Shivering Isles.

09:20.800 --> 09:24.000
But you could also pay a few dollars to give your horse armor.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
Now, it's important to understand this is completely cosmetic.

09:27.000 --> 09:32.200
It doesn't actually make your horse any better in combat or defend it, but you can buy it.

09:32.200 --> 09:33.100
And people did.

09:33.100 --> 09:36.300
In fact, a lot of people bought it, and this highlighted another thing.

09:36.300 --> 09:39.500
Making a game takes a long time, but once the main game is made,

09:39.500 --> 09:44.100
the development time it would take to make a cosmetic for that game is relatively short.

09:44.100 --> 09:49.900
And that cosmetic can be sold for a small amount of money, but it can be sold many, many times.

09:49.900 --> 09:55.600
The cost is micro, but the sales volume is high, hence microtransaction.

09:55.600 --> 10:01.000
Separate from the idea of a complete expansion, which would expand the game and make the game experience bigger,

10:01.000 --> 10:05.600
a microtransaction adds hardly anything beyond the original experience.

10:05.600 --> 10:08.700
It's almost inconsequential, but it's not free.

10:08.700 --> 10:15.000
So now developers know, expansions are a bit risky, but microtransactions are very safe and very small.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.100
Even if they don't sell, it's not a great waste of developer time.

10:18.100 --> 10:23.900
So the focus shifted away from selling a main game with lots of expansions to selling the main game

10:23.900 --> 10:28.200
and then lots and lots and lots and lots of small, additional things.

10:28.200 --> 10:33.200
The problem with this is now developers had a vested interest in keeping the coolest cosmetics

10:33.200 --> 10:39.500
or the most fun little things out of the base game and instead releasing them as additional microtransactions,

10:39.500 --> 10:41.300
which is something we'll see happen more and more.

10:41.300 --> 10:44.400
And this absolutely does not favour the player.

10:44.400 --> 10:48.500
Because it leads to an experience where you as a player, even though you have bought the game,

10:48.500 --> 10:53.200
when you sit down to play it, you do not feel like you have access to the whole game, because you don't.

10:53.200 --> 10:55.300
It used to be you bought a game and got a game.

10:55.300 --> 11:01.100
Now it's you buy a game and you get the main framework, which you need to pay more to flesh out.

11:01.100 --> 11:08.300
So let's add sell small additions to your game as microtransactions to the box of abusive monetization strategies.

11:08.300 --> 11:14.700
And as the box grows, so does the space it would need to take up on the game development pie.

11:14.700 --> 11:22.300
Now we head into 2009 to the rise of Facebook and one of the cornerstones of casual gaming and monetization progression, Farmville.

11:22.300 --> 11:27.500
Farmville was everywhere in the late 2000s, made by Zynga, and these guys were masters.

11:27.500 --> 11:33.400
Because Facebook was everywhere, everyone was on it, and even non-gamers were gaming, which sounds great.

11:33.400 --> 11:35.700
But they were burning through the game too quickly.

11:35.700 --> 11:41.100
They were enjoying it and then just moving on, which was not great, because Facebook is all about retention.

11:41.100 --> 11:45.100
So Farmville did something really counterintuitive to increase player retention.

11:45.100 --> 11:49.500
They gave you daily energy, so you couldn't progress more than a certain amount every day.

11:49.500 --> 11:54.300
Now these games were mostly played by people on phones and laptops, and people got bored pretty quickly.

11:54.300 --> 11:58.500
And one of the best ways to prevent boredom is to limit your time with something.

11:58.500 --> 12:01.100
Absence makes the heart grow fonder, as they say.

12:01.100 --> 12:09.400
So energy systems limiting what actions you could take, or timers connected to growing your crops or building things and you couldn't progress them quicker.

12:09.400 --> 12:16.500
By making the player progress only in short but intense bursts and then wait for their next fix of game,

12:16.500 --> 12:23.100
you either force them to pay more money to gain more energy or to skip the timers, or you make them return tomorrow.

12:23.200 --> 12:28.200
And this is game design focused on the formation of daily habits.

12:28.200 --> 12:31.500
The psychological power of the habit has been studied for years.

12:31.500 --> 12:39.700
Motivational speakers talk about themself health books, push them and now gaming companies were looking to use them as a way to turn players into users.

12:39.700 --> 12:42.100
Because it wasn't just about the game being fun anymore.

12:42.100 --> 12:47.300
The focus wasn't on giving the player the best experience you could give them and letting the player enjoy it at their own pace.

12:47.300 --> 12:54.300
The focus was about the game being effective at encouraging a specific behavior response from the user.

12:54.300 --> 12:58.000
Encouraging the user to return day after day is habit forming.

12:58.000 --> 13:04.700
Someone who plays your game habitually is more likely to remain playing even after the game itself has stopped being enjoyable.

13:04.700 --> 13:06.500
They're just continuing the habit.

13:06.500 --> 13:13.300
Along with this, game designers knew you would also have friends on Facebook that may not be playing the game and they wanted those friends to play the game.

13:13.300 --> 13:19.600
Which is why they put the mechanics in the game of share this achievement with your friend to get bonuses and get boosts.

13:19.600 --> 13:24.400
A huge amount of people began playing Facebook games not because they thought they would be the type of game they enjoy,

13:24.400 --> 13:27.700
but because they were doing their friend a favor by starting up.

13:27.700 --> 13:29.200
They were supporting their farm.

13:29.200 --> 13:30.800
They were joining their mafia.

13:30.800 --> 13:36.300
And just like MapleStory's Gacha being viewed by the players in the game, you could share the progress of your farm.

13:36.300 --> 13:40.300
You could show off how far along you were, which spurred competition.

13:40.300 --> 13:48.200
So we can add limiting progression per day and encouraging you to invite your friends to start the game to give yourself advantages,

13:48.200 --> 13:51.600
or the ability to share your progression with the community.

13:51.600 --> 13:55.600
Which is why achievements on almost all consoles and PCs are publicly viewable.

13:55.600 --> 13:59.000
Into the box of abusive monetization strategies.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.800
And while habitually playing something isn't generating money in itself,

14:02.800 --> 14:08.600
it does keep the audience around longer so they can be exposed to other, more successful strategies.

14:08.600 --> 14:12.300
Now some people will point out that paying to advance more or paying to skip timers

14:12.300 --> 14:18.100
is in some ways similar to the old arcade process of dying and then putting more coins in to continue.

14:18.100 --> 14:21.100
And it is similar, but there is a crucial difference.

14:21.100 --> 14:25.800
With an arcade game, you could in theory finish the game entirely on skill.

14:25.800 --> 14:32.200
These timers and energy bars in games such as Farmville cannot ever be finished on skill alone,

14:32.200 --> 14:37.600
because you will hit a wall that you will need to either wait for or pay to remove.

14:37.600 --> 14:40.700
But this wasn't everything. Nowhere near. Farmville had other strategies.

14:40.700 --> 14:45.100
You had timers and you could pay to make them progress faster, but not with money directly.

14:45.100 --> 14:50.400
Now you had to convert real money into a proprietary currency. In this case, Farmbox.

14:50.400 --> 14:56.800
And this is one of the most prevalent designs we still see used, because it does several psychological things disgustingly well.

14:56.800 --> 15:01.800
If you can buy something directly from a game, you can see the cost in a currency that you understand.

15:01.800 --> 15:09.300
But if the game displays items in their own proprietary currency, such as gems or coins or platinum or Farmbox or whatever they want to call it,

15:09.300 --> 15:15.300
you have to make one mental step converting the currency from what you understand to what you don't understand.

15:15.300 --> 15:22.100
So all these things are now one mental step away from having real value, and that is hugely important.

15:22.100 --> 15:25.300
Because even one step is further than most people are willing to go.

15:25.300 --> 15:32.900
So let's add that into the box. Proprietary in-game premium currency to obscure real world value by a single step.

15:32.900 --> 15:39.600
Bonus points if it makes you convert the currency to multiple other in-game currencies, which is almost completely impossible to track in your own mind.

15:39.600 --> 15:41.800
So you need to buy the currency. And this is the next trick.

15:41.800 --> 15:48.200
The currency is usually sold in packs, and these packs are specifically sized to either be just under what you actually need,

15:48.200 --> 15:52.500
or very, very close to the next best thing, making you consider the next pack up.

15:52.500 --> 16:02.400
For example, if you need 100 gems to buy something in the game and gem packs are sold in packs of 90 or 205, you may as well buy the 205 pack.

16:02.400 --> 16:09.600
But then there's a really good item in the game for 210, and you're only five gems short, but the next pack contains 500 gems.

16:09.600 --> 16:14.700
But there's a mega item for 505 gems, and you're only five gems shy of that now.

16:14.700 --> 16:19.900
You're not thinking about the number 505, you're thinking it's only five and then only another five.

16:20.000 --> 16:24.500
Much smaller jumps for much higher jumps in value.

16:24.500 --> 16:29.000
You'd be a fool if you didn't take them, right? So that's going in the box of bad design.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.400
But let's say you do buy a pack.

16:30.400 --> 16:35.700
Whatever pack you buy, you will spend your unique in-game proprietary currency, but then you'll discover something else.

16:35.700 --> 16:39.400
The currency is non-refundable, and it is almost impossible to spend all of it.

16:39.400 --> 16:43.400
You'll always be left with some random number, like four gems or two bits of platinum.

16:43.400 --> 16:49.300
It's never zero, and this will bother you, because in your mind, that's a waste, and you don't like waste.

16:49.300 --> 16:52.400
And if you don't spend that currency, then the game is keeping it, and you've paid for that.

16:52.400 --> 16:55.500
But the only way to make this useful is to buy another currency pack.

16:55.500 --> 16:58.100
I mean, you'd be a fool if you didn't do that, right?

16:58.100 --> 17:02.000
You can't have premium currency just sitting there in strange, unspendable amounts.

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
It's annoying, and it's by design, so add that to the box.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.100
But maybe you know all this, and you're not a fool.

17:08.100 --> 17:12.000
You won't spend a lot, you wait for a sale, but oh look, you're a brand new player, and there's an offer.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.700
A load of premium currency, a boost, a few cosmetics.

17:14.700 --> 17:18.700
It's a limited time offer, and it's all for the low price of just under a dollar.

17:18.800 --> 17:21.100
Now, you'd definitely be a fool if you didn't buy this.

17:21.100 --> 17:26.300
If you've ever wondered why the intro packs to almost any game are such good value,

17:26.300 --> 17:33.000
it's because studies have shown people who buy a single purchase are much, much more likely to make another purchase.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.700
So you want to make the first purchase really enticing.

17:35.700 --> 17:40.200
And it's because some phones need you to authorise in-app purchases.

17:40.200 --> 17:45.100
But once you've authorised one, it will not double-check for any extra purchases.

17:45.100 --> 17:49.800
So you confirm that you want to buy the cheap pack, and then it doesn't double-check for the expensive packs.

17:49.800 --> 17:55.100
Because every screen between the player and a purchase is a moment they could doubt and reconsider.

17:55.100 --> 18:00.600
So you want to get those, are you sure you want to purchase this, checks, agreed with, and out the way, early.

18:00.600 --> 18:04.600
Unusually cheap intro microtransactions just to get you into a habit.

18:04.600 --> 18:05.800
Let's add that to the box.

18:05.800 --> 18:10.900
And while the box is looking pretty anti-player and anti-consumer so far, it's nowhere near full.

18:10.900 --> 18:19.500
To truly see how effective this ugly design can be, we only need to go forward one year to 2010 and look at FIFA's Ultimate Team mode.

18:19.500 --> 18:25.000
Now, I'm not really into football games, but the FIFA franchise of games actually highlights the game design shift really well.

18:25.000 --> 18:34.300
It shows how games have moved from being a fun experience by themselves to a fun enough framework that other monetisation tactics will cling to like limpets.

18:34.300 --> 18:39.600
In FIFA, you can buy loot boxes which contain random cards of players and use these to build up your Ultimate Team.

18:39.600 --> 18:43.300
The Ultimate Team mode takes several of the box ideas and combines them.

18:43.300 --> 18:49.000
And now the Ultimate Team mode makes more money than the box sales of FIFA itself.

18:49.000 --> 18:57.200
In fact, since 2018, FIFA Ultimate Team has generated over $1 billion in revenue per year for EA.

18:57.200 --> 19:00.500
In 2021, they made $1.6 billion.

19:00.500 --> 19:02.900
And it happens every single year.

19:02.900 --> 19:09.300
And the cards you buy in the Ultimate Team for one year cannot be used in the next year, meaning the microtransactions now have a shelf life.

19:09.400 --> 19:12.000
Horse armour may last forever, but what if it didn't?

19:12.000 --> 19:15.400
What if you could make a player pay for it again and again every year?

19:15.400 --> 19:19.200
Let's add that to the box, yearly repeating microtransactions.

19:19.200 --> 19:22.600
Now, as a developer, you'd look at this thing, this box and think,

19:22.600 --> 19:26.300
wow, selling my game isn't the profitable thing anymore.

19:26.300 --> 19:28.800
It's what I can sell within the game.

19:28.800 --> 19:36.600
By now, the box of abusive monetisation strategies is so big, it's almost impossible to ignore if you are making a game.

19:36.600 --> 19:40.400
One year later in 2011, the MMORPG RuneScape is suffering.

19:40.400 --> 19:46.500
They had a major update to the combat system, which a huge majority of the player base hated and this made them lose a lot of players.

19:46.500 --> 19:53.300
This is a mistake worthy of its own video, but the bottom line is they are a monthly subscription game, losing subscribing players.

19:53.300 --> 19:58.700
And they need to find a way to either recover paying members or to stem the tide of people leaving.

19:58.700 --> 20:00.500
Enter the loyalty programme.

20:00.500 --> 20:07.000
Every month of membership, you now earn loyalty points and you earn more for every consecutive month that you remain subscribed.

20:07.000 --> 20:13.600
And then you can spend loyalty points on cool exclusive cosmetics or mechanically powerful auras and boosts.

20:13.600 --> 20:17.000
So now, cancelling your membership wasn't just a case of thinking,

20:17.000 --> 20:22.700
I'm not enjoying the game, so I won't pay, which is a very simple understandable fair transaction.

20:22.700 --> 20:28.500
It's now a case of thinking, I'm not enjoying the game, but if I unsubscribe, I break my loyalty streak

20:28.500 --> 20:34.800
and will earn far fewer loyalty points over the long run, which will put me at a disadvantage if I ever do want to come back in the future.

20:34.800 --> 20:37.300
Which is not as fair.

20:37.300 --> 20:42.900
The transaction used to be simple, but now we're putting the player in the position of give money even if you don't want to play,

20:42.900 --> 20:45.600
because you don't want to break a habit, that's going in the box.

20:45.600 --> 20:50.400
And by now, the box is demanding a bigger and bigger slice of the game design pie chart.

20:50.400 --> 20:56.100
Two years later, 2013 sees the release of Dead Space 3, the third installment in a terrific horror trilogy.

20:56.100 --> 20:56.900
Well, sort of.

20:56.900 --> 21:02.300
While Dead Space 1 and 2 were indeed terrific horror games with tension and pacing and balanced gameplay and great stories,

21:02.300 --> 21:04.100
Dead Space 3 did something strange.

21:04.100 --> 21:10.100
It took the idea of you being a lone engineer trapped on an infested spaceship, struggling against incredible odds,

21:10.100 --> 21:14.500
using only your small collection of mining tools and very limited ammunition to survive,

21:14.500 --> 21:21.000
and it added in the ability to let you buy in-game guns with real cash from the cash shop.

21:21.000 --> 21:26.100
A horror survival game selling you in-game guns and ammo,

21:26.100 --> 21:30.000
completely defeating the atmosphere and vibe the game was going for.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.600
Selling players things they could use within your game to make the game easier.

21:33.600 --> 21:36.500
Let's add that to the box, that's effectively selling power.

21:36.500 --> 21:39.100
This one manages to out-monetize even the arcade.

21:39.100 --> 21:45.000
It would be like putting more coins into Time Crisis and getting a rocket launcher, or removing the time limit in Crazy Taxi.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.200
It sort of defeats the purpose of the original game.

21:48.200 --> 21:55.900
Along with Dead Space selling guns, we now see the MOBA game Dota 2 release what many consider the first major Battle Pass system.

21:55.900 --> 22:01.100
Now, when this craze started, I remember walking into gaming shops and seeing the phrase Battle Pass everywhere,

22:01.100 --> 22:03.300
and I had no idea what they were.

22:03.300 --> 22:12.400
Effectively, they are optional purchasers, which unlock a series of challenges or processes you can go through to unlock more stuff in the game,

22:12.400 --> 22:14.100
but they are time-sensitive.

22:14.100 --> 22:18.900
So you buy the monthly Battle Pass, and if you play a certain number of hours or kill a certain number of enemies

22:18.900 --> 22:24.900
or achieve a certain number of whatever it wants you to do, you can advance along the Battle Pass and unlock new stuff.

22:24.900 --> 22:29.500
Now, you could just have the unlockable stuff be available for everyone to unlock anyway,

22:29.500 --> 22:33.500
but by limiting it to a timed Battle Pass, you're doing a few manipulative things.

22:33.500 --> 22:36.200
You're creating a fear of missing out, or FOMO.

22:36.200 --> 22:42.200
As players know, if they don't have this month's Battle Pass, they may never get the full experience or that rare cosmetic ever again.

22:42.200 --> 22:48.200
So you are encouraging an unhealthy amount of gameplay, because if you're not advancing your Battle Pass, you're losing precious time.

22:48.200 --> 22:54.800
So now you're actually discouraging players from enjoying any other game and forcing them to focus entirely on progression within yours.

22:54.800 --> 23:01.000
This design is, of course, at odds with the limit playtime technique, because they appeal to different demographics.

23:01.000 --> 23:06.500
Remember, a Battle Pass or limited-time progression track doesn't always actively improve a game,

23:06.500 --> 23:11.000
but it does always increase that game's revenue, so throw it in the box.

23:11.000 --> 23:20.500
By now, even the concept of a fun, well-made game is starting to look like a horrifically augmented shadow of its former self.

23:20.500 --> 23:27.300
Imagine what a well-made game would look like if you tried to shoehorn in all of the techniques in this box.

23:27.300 --> 23:31.000
And unfortunately, eventually, you won't need to imagine. We're seeing it more and more.

23:31.000 --> 23:36.700
Later that same year, one of my favourite games comes out, Assassin's Creed Black Flag, a fantastic pirate game.

23:36.700 --> 23:44.400
There's just one problem. Unless you own both a PlayStation and an Xbox and are willing to buy two copies of the game, you can never experience the full game.

23:44.400 --> 23:51.000
Black Flag featured console-exclusive levels, which not only fuelled the petty console wars,

23:51.000 --> 23:59.600
but also highlighted the fact that marketing executives were now powerful enough to tell game developers exactly what their players deserved,

23:59.600 --> 24:03.500
or, more importantly, what their non-players don't deserve.

24:03.500 --> 24:05.900
This is not player-focused design at all.

24:05.900 --> 24:12.700
And while I completely understand the power of console exclusives, when I walked into a game shop and picked up two copies of Black Flag and realised,

24:12.700 --> 24:18.800
no matter what I choose, there is a mission I won't get to play because I don't have the right console, that didn't leave a good taste in my mouth.

24:18.800 --> 24:25.900
So while Dota may have started the Battle Pass idea, it was almost perfected four years later in 2017 by Fortnite Season 2,

24:25.900 --> 24:29.100
which replaced the season shop with a Battle Pass system.

24:29.100 --> 24:37.000
And then later in November of 2017, we witness a bit of gaming history, and it fills us all with a sense of pride and accomplishment.

24:37.000 --> 24:43.200
Star Wars Battlefront II was an amazing game which released back in 2005, not to be confused with Star Wars Battlefront II,

24:43.200 --> 24:45.700
which was a mediocre game which released in 2017.

24:45.700 --> 24:51.500
It was a full-price game and yet also had a loot box system in it, along with premium currency system.

24:51.500 --> 24:57.200
This led to a Reddit user complaining that even though they'd bought the $80 deluxe version of the game,

24:57.200 --> 25:00.600
they still couldn't play as Darth Vader from day one.

25:00.600 --> 25:07.500
Unlocking Darth Vader means buying his hero crate, which costs 60,000 in-game credits, or you can spend real money.

25:07.500 --> 25:11.800
Now, you can earn an average of 250 credits per 10-minute match at the time,

25:11.800 --> 25:18.800
so you'd have to grind for roughly 40 hours of constant gameplay, longer than the average completion time of most video games,

25:18.800 --> 25:21.500
to unlock a single rare character.

25:21.500 --> 25:25.400
Or you could pay crystals in the premium shop and spend those on hero crates and just hope.

25:25.400 --> 25:27.600
EA responded to this Reddit complaint saying,

25:27.600 --> 25:35.100
The reason crates were so expensive or take so long to unlock is to give a sense of pride and accomplishment to players who did manage to unlock them.

25:35.100 --> 25:38.600
This becomes the most down-voted comment in Reddit history.

25:38.600 --> 25:42.800
So, locking premium parts of your full-priced game behind either hours of grind,

25:42.800 --> 25:47.800
or spending even more money to unlock the cool stuff before other people who bought the same game as you.

25:47.800 --> 25:52.900
Now, it's important to understand that games having things locked within them is not necessarily bad design.

25:52.900 --> 25:56.400
One of my favorite games of all time is SSX Tricky, the snowboarding game.

25:56.400 --> 26:00.100
And as you play through that, you unlock new characters, new boards, and new tracks.

26:00.100 --> 26:06.300
Progression within a game, and rewarding that progression with new mechanics, new characters, and new areas, is not bad.

26:06.300 --> 26:10.000
The problem was, progression wasn't the only way to unlock this.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.700
You could simply pay more money to get it immediately.

26:12.700 --> 26:18.900
And because it was a competitive game, people who paid the extra money were at an advantage over those who did not.

26:18.900 --> 26:22.000
This is a video about how newer games feel wrong.

26:22.000 --> 26:28.500
And it feels wrong to buy the same game as someone else, and to know that they will have an advantage over you if they pay more.

26:28.500 --> 26:32.400
Throw that in the box of abusive monetization. Why not? It's going to work.

26:32.400 --> 26:35.400
And then, five years later, Diablo Immortal happened.

26:35.400 --> 26:40.800
Now, I've already covered Diablo Immortal pretty extensively in the video The Diabolically Immoral, Diablo Immortal,

26:40.800 --> 26:47.100
and its follow-up about the legendary crests, because it took basically every idea from the big box of abusive monetization

26:47.100 --> 26:51.000
and sprinkled them liberally over a somewhat Diablo-looking game,

26:51.000 --> 26:57.300
including multiple premium currencies, a deliberately similar in-game item which functions slightly differently to a paid version of the same thing,

26:57.300 --> 27:00.000
and multiple battle passes all called different things.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.800
But don't worry, because everyone assured me that Diablo Immortal was a mobile game,

27:03.800 --> 27:09.000
and thus would not be representative of the actual next Diablo game which would be Diablo IV.

27:09.000 --> 27:14.500
Everyone told me Diablo IV would be a full game by itself, with no cash shop, with gameplay first,

27:14.500 --> 27:17.400
and none of the strategies from the big box of badness.

27:17.400 --> 27:22.900
So, of course, there are various digital versions of the game, the more expensive ones giving you an accelerated battle pass bonus,

27:22.900 --> 27:27.600
allowing you to progress quicker, and there is a cosmetic cash shop using its own proprietary currency.

27:27.600 --> 27:34.800
And if you're thinking Diablo doesn't need all these extra bells and whistles to be a good Diablo game, you are correct.

27:34.800 --> 27:40.000
These have not been added because they make the game better, they've been added because they make the game money.

27:40.100 --> 27:44.300
And then Darktide released, which is a full-price game, with an abusively priced cash shop.

27:44.300 --> 27:49.700
Or you can grind for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours to get some of the cheap things in that shop.

27:49.700 --> 27:52.100
And now we're here. So why have games become like this?

27:52.100 --> 27:54.000
Simple, because games are businesses.

27:54.000 --> 27:59.100
Games have been businesses since arcades, since consoles allowed you to buy the game and have it in your own home.

27:59.100 --> 28:00.900
They have always wanted to make money.

28:00.900 --> 28:05.200
But up until now, the best way to make the most amount of money was to make the best game you possibly could,

28:05.200 --> 28:08.300
because people would buy it, and that was it, the transaction was finished.

28:08.400 --> 28:14.500
It was fair. The best way to make money on modern games is to make the best framework as a holder for these strategies.

28:14.500 --> 28:18.400
And companies have experimented with various methods to increase income over the years,

28:18.400 --> 28:24.300
from gacha loot boxes to pre-orders, console exclusives to battle passes, energy systems to just straight-up selling power.

28:24.300 --> 28:30.100
And instead of hiring game designers, they hired psychologists to build habits, to reinforce addictive behaviors,

28:30.100 --> 28:32.700
to design gameplay loops which encourage spending.

28:32.700 --> 28:35.900
The problem was these techniques were never about the player having fun.

28:35.900 --> 28:38.400
They were about the user being monetized.

28:38.400 --> 28:43.800
And when a marketing executive pictures you playing a game, you aren't pictured smiling and laughing with friends,

28:43.800 --> 28:47.700
you're pictured opening your wallet and reaching for your credit card, because that's their goal.

28:47.700 --> 28:54.700
And eventually, the Pandora's box of abusive monetization strategies was so full of proven, effective techniques

28:54.700 --> 28:59.400
that making a game is often no longer about the game, at least not for the people in charge of the money.

28:59.400 --> 29:05.300
The game is now simply a life support system for as many of these systems as you can design into it.

29:05.300 --> 29:12.600
The game as a host and the parasite of monetization has begun to take over, and the unfortunate reality is this works.

29:12.600 --> 29:20.700
Even with a breakout incredible success like Elden Ring, which won Game of the Year and sold over 18 million copies as of this video,

29:20.700 --> 29:25.600
at $60 a sale, that's over a billion dollars in sales worldwide,

29:25.600 --> 29:32.000
that is still slightly shy of how much money Genshin Impact made this year.

29:32.100 --> 29:39.200
It is still shy of how much money FIFA Ultimate Team has made every year for the last four years.

29:39.200 --> 29:48.600
The reality is, when companies look at that pie chart of game development time and how they divide developer time or invested money,

29:48.600 --> 29:55.200
that big box of abusive monetization strategies, that Pandora's box of terribleness is so effective,

29:55.200 --> 30:00.700
they would be hurting their own profit to not put at least some of the techniques in.

30:00.700 --> 30:07.600
The older designers simply didn't have the knowledge of this box, and even if they did, they didn't have the technology to act on it at the time.

30:07.600 --> 30:15.200
Modern design often puts the player into an awkward position where the game has spent more time focusing on the manipulative abusive systems

30:15.200 --> 30:19.300
than it has on just being the best game it could be.

30:19.300 --> 30:24.100
So what is the exact choice which makes games feel wrong?

30:24.100 --> 30:26.600
Is it MapleStory's fault for adding Gachapon?

30:26.600 --> 30:28.300
Is it Oblivion's fault for the horse armor?

30:28.300 --> 30:30.600
Is it Dota's fault for the Battle Pass FIFA's fault?

30:30.600 --> 30:32.200
For the success of Ultimate Team?

30:32.200 --> 30:34.700
Is it Farmville's fault for mastering the addiction cycle?

30:34.700 --> 30:37.400
Or is it EA's fault for locking away Darth Vader?

30:37.400 --> 30:39.100
Unfortunately, it's kind of all of them.

30:39.100 --> 30:41.100
It's just the reality of games designed today.

30:41.100 --> 30:43.500
You cannot close the lid on Pandora's box.

30:43.500 --> 30:46.900
Designers can't UNK know the effectiveness of these techniques.

30:46.900 --> 30:51.800
And every game made for the rest of time has to either use them or actively choose to avoid them.

30:51.800 --> 30:58.800
So the exact choice that makes a game go from being the best it can possibly be to anti-player or anti-consumer

30:58.800 --> 31:05.700
is when a designer or a marketing executive stops thinking about how they can make the best game they're capable of

31:05.700 --> 31:09.800
and starts throwing some sly glances toward the box in the corner.

31:09.800 --> 31:15.400
And when they say, hey, this technique may not fit our game perfectly, but it's proven to make a lot of money.

31:15.400 --> 31:17.600
Do you think we could put it in our game?

31:17.600 --> 31:19.000
That is the moment.

31:19.000 --> 31:25.400
Any specific game goes downhill from what it could be from a player's perspective.

31:25.400 --> 31:31.300
And the worst part is that big evil box and all its dark design knowledge is constantly being added to.

31:31.300 --> 31:34.900
And when you play a new game and spot the cash shop and the battle pass and the premium currency

31:34.900 --> 31:39.800
and the awkward pack size and the loot boxes and the exclusive levels and when you just feel sad

31:39.800 --> 31:41.900
that the game didn't have to do that,

31:41.900 --> 31:49.500
that's when you know that the pie chart of design of this game had at least a small slice dedicated to that stupid box.

31:49.500 --> 31:54.800
A small slice focused on making the game a little bit anti-player in the name of a lot of profit.

31:54.800 --> 31:59.700
But personally, I also know it can be very cathartic to be angry at a thing instead of a concept.

31:59.700 --> 32:04.400
So let's all just collectively agree to blame the stupid horse.

32:04.400 --> 32:05.400
