WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.440
Okay, brilliant. Shall we make a start then? I think most people have joined now, so welcome

00:07.440 --> 00:15.360
everybody to the first session of the Introduction to Critical Realism webinars. Today we're talking

00:15.360 --> 00:21.760
about ontology and this is the first of six and the following sessions will engage with epistemology,

00:21.760 --> 00:27.680
methodology, approaches to analysis, key concepts and critical realism as a framework. So

00:27.680 --> 00:38.000
yeah, make sure you do join the other sessions as well. So just a few very brief bits of housekeeping.

00:38.800 --> 00:45.680
So firstly, please use the Q&A tool during the webinar. So if you have any immediate technical

00:45.680 --> 00:51.680
issues or want to make a comment, use the chat box. But any questions that you have for us,

00:51.680 --> 00:57.120
please put them in the Q&A section. And if you do that throughout the session, we'll try and pick

00:57.120 --> 01:01.760
those up and make sure that we're answering all the questions. You can also comment on questions

01:01.760 --> 01:07.920
in there and vote the ones that you really want to hear answered. Okay, so I think it'll be good

01:07.920 --> 01:13.920
to start with some introductions. So I'll introduce myself. First of all, I'm Jack Newman from the

01:13.920 --> 01:20.960
University of Surrey. My broader research interests are around British politics, social security policy,

01:21.040 --> 01:27.680
local government. Although my interest in critical realism goes back about eight or

01:27.680 --> 01:33.040
nine years to when I was doing my master's degree. And coming from a political science

01:33.040 --> 01:40.640
background, I came across critical realism through the structure agency debate and trying to find a

01:40.640 --> 01:48.480
suitable argument or solution to this problem of structure and agency. So that's my background

01:48.480 --> 01:52.880
and how I came to critical realism. Caroline, do you want to introduce yourself too?

01:52.880 --> 01:58.880
Yes. So I'm Caroline Coon, and I work at the University of Paspar as a lecturer there in the

01:58.880 --> 02:06.480
School of Education. And I'm very interested in the combination of, I would say, technology,

02:06.480 --> 02:13.120
education from a sociological perspective, I would say. And so I came to critical realism in a

02:13.920 --> 02:21.600
later stage in my PhD where I, when I started to make sense of the data, I just couldn't

02:21.600 --> 02:26.480
with what I had at hand. It wasn't possible for me. And I was really kind of struggling. And I

02:26.480 --> 02:32.080
realized I need something to help me hear some theoretical kind of. And so I came across in a

02:32.080 --> 02:37.920
conversation with someone at the University of Cape Town that they were using critical realism in

02:38.000 --> 02:45.120
when they were exploring open educational resources. And once I started to read and read and read,

02:45.120 --> 02:51.040
it was quite difficult at the very beginning. But I realized that was really what I needed to

02:51.040 --> 02:55.840
make sense of what I was seeing in the data, particularly things that weren't there present,

02:55.840 --> 03:02.240
that weren't, that they weren't showing, but that they were there. And yeah, so I started

03:02.240 --> 03:07.280
to study it by myself because my supervisor didn't know anything about it, but he trusted me.

03:07.280 --> 03:15.120
So I did a long journey into critical realism. And I think it is incredibly worth while our time.

03:15.120 --> 03:21.920
And so that's how I came into it. Yes, that's me. Brilliant. I'll just say a couple more things,

03:21.920 --> 03:28.080
and then we'll hopefully get some introductions from you guys, the audience. And so yeah, just to

03:28.080 --> 03:33.120
be clear, if you have any technical issues or want to make comments or introduce yourselves,

03:33.120 --> 03:38.480
please use the chat function. If you have any questions, please use the Q&A button,

03:39.680 --> 03:45.680
or you can raise your hand as well during the discussion section. So here's how today's going

03:45.680 --> 03:53.760
to run. We've got three parts to the webinar. Part one, we'll ask what is ontology. I know that this,

03:54.400 --> 03:59.520
many of you will know what ontology is, but we're trying to make sure we kind of keep everyone

03:59.520 --> 04:06.000
with us. And it's worth going back to, I think, for those who do not know already. And then we'll

04:06.000 --> 04:11.760
talk about what a critical realist approach to ontology is. And then we'll conclude in the third

04:11.760 --> 04:16.960
part by looking at the implications of a critical realist ontology. And hopefully we'll be taking

04:16.960 --> 04:22.160
questions throughout and we'll have some discussion and we'll leave some extra time for discussion

04:22.160 --> 04:29.440
at the end. And we're due to finish in about an hour and a half time. Okay, yeah, I'll hand back to

04:29.440 --> 04:35.600
Caroline. Yeah, I was just wanting to ask the audience if anyone is keen to just introduce

04:35.600 --> 04:43.440
themselves, what you do, do you study, do you work, and in a way, what brought you into critical

04:43.440 --> 04:50.800
realism. We're a lot of people, it means we can't, not everyone can take the mic, but it would be

04:50.800 --> 04:56.320
lovely to hear from some of you, so that we have an idea of who is in the room and the rest can

04:56.320 --> 05:00.800
write it in the chat, which I see is already happening. There are lots of introductions

05:00.800 --> 05:09.120
in the chat. So anyone who would like to take the mic, that would be great. Yeah, that is what we

05:09.120 --> 05:22.160
would like to happen. Chris Roberts here. I'm relatively new to the field. I mean, years ago,

05:22.800 --> 05:27.680
when I probably do my masters and I was sort of this thing called the internet had just been

05:27.680 --> 05:35.360
discovered and I was, my supervisor was very much into sort of delusional guitaries, sort of bodies

05:35.360 --> 05:41.920
without organs, and I found that a bit kind of radical. So I kind of moved from that more to

05:41.920 --> 05:47.600
sort of constructivist view. My field is education, particularly health professional education,

05:47.600 --> 05:56.000
but very, so it felt quite limited by what constructivist approaches to educational,

05:56.000 --> 06:01.520
particularly transformational settings, you know, you know, trying to get sort of systemic

06:01.520 --> 06:09.520
change in the health professionals education sector. But you know, the lack of sort of,

06:10.400 --> 06:16.880
you know, sort of theories or sort of big models. And I guess then through a colleague or sort of

06:16.880 --> 06:24.640
introduced to critical realism, it seemed to be a sort of really fit, good fit. It seemed to be

06:24.640 --> 06:31.680
not rejecting some of the sort of the positivistic, post-positivist sort of positions, but critical

06:31.680 --> 06:38.320
of them and seeing them in a very different way. And yet not seeing everything as sort of socially

06:38.320 --> 06:45.760
constructed. There are noble things out there, but we just got fallible knowledge. So it just kind

06:45.760 --> 06:50.720
of fitted for me. And I guess the work that I've been doing at the moment with colleagues

06:51.600 --> 06:58.800
is more at that kind of the first, you know, the first sort of possibility of naturalism

06:58.800 --> 07:05.280
kind of approach with this stratified ontology. I was thinking I was got some more to the, you

07:05.280 --> 07:10.240
know, meta reality was just getting further and further away from a comfort zone. Although the

07:10.240 --> 07:18.800
recent IACR, Frederick van der Berg was talking about, you know, how can you not want that project

07:18.880 --> 07:25.440
of emancipation, a kind of sort of utopia in the air? And so shouldn't we consider the whole body

07:26.080 --> 07:35.600
together? Thank you, Chris. That's great. And I would say, I mean, Deleuze and Guattari is so

07:35.600 --> 07:41.280
different than critical realism. So it's just really fascinating how, you know, how theory

07:41.280 --> 07:46.800
really in philosophy illuminates from different standpoints and different people from very

07:46.800 --> 07:49.680
different angles. So great. And thank you, Chris. Anyone else?

07:55.920 --> 08:02.800
Well, I see a lot of activity in the chat. So great. Shall we then, Jack?

08:03.600 --> 08:07.600
David has his hand up. Yeah, thank you. I didn't see it.

08:08.080 --> 08:18.960
David, go ahead. Oh, is that was that for me? Yeah. Yeah, so I'm David Palmer. I'm an anthropologist

08:18.960 --> 08:26.640
at the University of Hong Kong. And I do a lot of work in relation to the anthropology of religion

08:26.640 --> 08:37.760
in China and Asia. And I also, my work also goes into the sociology of religion. And I know

08:37.760 --> 08:43.360
Phil Gorski, and he's been kind of promoting critical realism for the past many years. And I'm

08:43.360 --> 08:48.800
actually, in a sense, from a postcolonial perspective, I'm quite interested in looking at how can we

08:48.800 --> 08:55.040
seriously take different ontologies seriously? And what are the ontological foundations of

08:55.040 --> 09:02.400
sociological theory and sociological methodology? So I'm, I'm, I think it's extremely important to

09:02.400 --> 09:13.200
really have a deep awareness and critical thinking about the ontological assumptions of our own

09:13.200 --> 09:19.040
discipline and the implications of that. And now moving directly into a project that I'm working

09:19.040 --> 09:23.760
on now, I'm actually working on a book and a course, actually, that I'm going to be teaching

09:23.760 --> 09:30.720
just in a couple of hours on science and religion, which I'm co teaching with an experimental physicist

09:31.600 --> 09:39.600
who is a Christian. So we, we take, and I take more the Asian, like Taoist kind of perspective. So

09:40.160 --> 09:48.880
we're really in trying to construct a framework for rethinking and reframing the relationship

09:48.880 --> 09:52.800
between science and religion. We've come across a lot of concepts that are very,

09:53.840 --> 09:58.480
that are very seem to resonate a lot with critical realism. So I would like to really

09:59.840 --> 10:02.400
get a more systematic understanding of this approach.

10:05.280 --> 10:10.720
Thank you, David. That's, that's great. Thank you. So interesting. Yes, Jack was saying so many,

10:10.720 --> 10:16.160
you know, so different points of view and different needs as well. I think that is fascinating. Thank

10:16.240 --> 10:25.040
you so much. I can't see hands up or anything. And, and also conscious of the time I shall,

10:25.920 --> 10:30.480
we shall start our presentation. And, and, you know, we're welcoming the chat because we read it

10:30.480 --> 10:37.840
then afterwards. And yeah, thank you so much. I'm reading here. Hasuki, Keinde, so interesting.

10:37.840 --> 10:43.920
Thank you. Shall we start then, Jack? I am so Jack will go with the first part about what is ontology

10:43.920 --> 10:52.160
in general terms. And I'll follow them. What is the critical realist understanding of this concept

10:52.160 --> 10:58.880
of ontology? And then some practical and physical philosophical implications. Brilliant. Thanks,

10:58.880 --> 11:05.360
Caroline. Yes. So let's get started with the question of what is ontology? And I'm sure some

11:05.360 --> 11:10.640
of you have an idea. Some of you might think you have a good idea. And so let's just go through

11:10.640 --> 11:18.640
the basics of what this, what ontology means. And I want to start out with this definition that you

11:18.640 --> 11:25.360
always see in the textbooks here. So ontology is the philosophy of being an existence. Now,

11:25.360 --> 11:30.720
I remember reading this in the textbooks back when I was a master's student and not really having a

11:30.720 --> 11:36.400
clue what this meant. I think quite often it's a useful definition if you already know about ontology

11:36.400 --> 11:42.560
but not very good as an introduction. So I just want to unpack this a little bit. So when we talk

11:42.560 --> 11:49.360
about philosophy in this sense, what are we thinking about? So we're thinking about assumptions.

11:49.360 --> 11:55.040
That's it. That is beliefs that people hold. They might not even realize they hold these beliefs.

11:56.000 --> 12:02.560
We're talking about controversies. So areas of disagreement or debate. And we're talking about

12:02.560 --> 12:07.840
theories. So systems of thought. They might be approaches to social science or they might be

12:07.840 --> 12:16.240
religions perhaps. So ontology is a set of assumptions, controversies and theories.

12:16.960 --> 12:22.720
What are they about? Moving to the right hand side of the slide there, we're thinking about being and

12:22.720 --> 12:29.360
existence. So what do we mean by being an existence in this context? So when we're thinking about being,

12:29.360 --> 12:36.080
we could think about the essence, experience or state of consciousness of living things.

12:36.080 --> 12:43.040
What it is to be a person in the world or perhaps what it is to be an animal or non-person in the

12:43.040 --> 12:50.960
world. And then much more broadly than this and perhaps more importantly, to ontology is also

12:50.960 --> 12:57.600
about existence in general. Everything that is in some way real beyond our perception of it.

12:57.600 --> 13:02.960
So yes, it's about our experience in the world. It's also about how the world actually is

13:04.000 --> 13:10.160
outside of our experience. So yeah, when we're talking about ontology, we're thinking about

13:10.160 --> 13:16.880
the assumptions, controversies and theories that are about reality in general, I suppose.

13:18.400 --> 13:22.560
Okay, so I want to introduce a couple of skeptical challenges just to get us start

13:22.560 --> 13:28.960
thinking about ontology. I pulled out a couple of quotes from Descartes here who is kind of

13:28.960 --> 13:38.880
one of the key philosophers of modern Western philosophy. And he argues in his or writes in

13:38.880 --> 13:45.360
his meditations, there is the fact that I'm sitting here seated by the fire, attired in a dressing

13:45.360 --> 13:50.480
gown. So that's what that's where he was when he was writing his meditations. But and here's where

13:50.480 --> 13:55.680
the challenge comes in. How often has it happened to me that in the night I dreamt that I found

13:55.680 --> 14:01.920
myself in this particular place, that I was dressed and seated near the fire whilst in reality,

14:01.920 --> 14:08.960
I was lying undressed in bed. So Descartes raises the problem of how we know that we're awake and

14:08.960 --> 14:14.960
not dreaming. And if you go to menti.com there and enter the code, some of you have done so already,

14:14.960 --> 14:20.000
if so go on to the next slide. And it'd be great if you could answer the poll that's on there just

14:20.080 --> 14:25.200
to have a think about this. Yes, and I'm here waiting for your answers to just see what you

14:25.200 --> 14:30.080
think if you're dreaming or if you're not dreaming, or if you're if you're not sure about what's

14:30.080 --> 14:38.560
happening. Because the interesting thing here is to kind of challenge our thinking about whether

14:38.560 --> 14:45.680
our day to day perception of reality is really giving us a true window or a true insight into how

14:45.680 --> 14:55.120
the world really is around us. I'll just give you a moment to have a think about that one. Yes, I'm

14:55.120 --> 15:02.320
here. Sorry, Jack, what was the particular question again? So if you go to menti.com there and enter

15:02.320 --> 15:07.520
that code, it should give you a question for you to answer. The current question is,

15:07.840 --> 15:18.880
are you 100% sure you're not dreaming right now? So I have six people that are not dreaming, seven,

15:18.880 --> 15:24.880
eight. And then I have two people that are not really sure. And two people that are dreaming. So

15:24.880 --> 15:32.640
we have 12 now that are not dreaming. And we're still have two that not three now that they are

15:32.640 --> 15:43.920
dreaming. Yes, 13, that 14 that are not dreaming, three that are not sure. So I think the tendency

15:44.720 --> 15:53.840
is to think that you're not dreaming. Okay, so you guys have a fairly, a fair amount of certainty

15:53.840 --> 15:58.640
that your perceptions are giving you a true indication of reality perhaps. Yes, 15.

15:58.640 --> 16:06.720
Wow. Okay, let's take another similar question then, just to get us to think about this question

16:06.720 --> 16:11.920
of our immediate perception of the world around us. So I don't know whether anyone's seen the film

16:11.920 --> 16:18.080
The Matrix. I recommend it, if not, it's a good film. But I just want to introduce a premise here.

16:18.800 --> 16:27.600
In the top picture there, this chap, Neo, is living in the world day to day,

16:27.600 --> 16:34.640
and he gets met by this person, Morpheus, who explains to him that actually he's not living

16:34.640 --> 16:39.520
in the world. He's really laid in one of these tanks that you can see in the bottom picture.

16:39.520 --> 16:45.520
And a simulation of reality is being pumped into his mind. So that's the kind of premise of the

16:45.520 --> 16:52.480
film there. So Morpheus says, Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that seems you seem so sure it was real?

16:52.480 --> 16:56.960
If we're unable to wake up from that dream, how would you tell the difference between the dream

16:56.960 --> 17:02.720
world and the real world? Now, I'm not trying to, again, you can go to Mentimeter and answer the

17:02.720 --> 17:07.360
question there. I'm not trying to convince you that we're all living in a simulation far from it.

17:07.360 --> 17:13.680
I'm just trying to open the prospect that our day to day perceptions don't give us a kind of clear

17:14.720 --> 17:21.120
picture on what reality is really like. And reality may be other than our perception of it

17:21.120 --> 17:26.560
on a day to day basis. And Chris is saying in the chat, I'm not dreaming that I cannot

17:26.560 --> 17:34.640
connect to the Mentimeter pool. Sorry, Chris. Yeah, it not always works. I have it in front of me.

17:34.640 --> 17:39.680
It is active. And I'm sorry if it doesn't work. It's just that sometimes happens.

17:40.720 --> 17:47.680
But I like your answer. It's a good answer. I also quite like Mauricio's answer that in his,

17:47.680 --> 17:50.960
in dreams, I don't pay bills. And that's how I know. Yeah.

17:51.920 --> 18:01.120
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I'm here. I'm keen to see if it's possible to live. One is saying I'm

18:01.120 --> 18:06.880
no, it's not possible to live in a simulation. And another one says yes, it is. And then we have

18:06.880 --> 18:12.880
two people, but three people that don't think four, that we were living in a five, that we're

18:12.880 --> 18:21.040
living in a simulation, five people and six people. And then we have three that that yes,

18:21.040 --> 18:27.600
we can live in a simulation. So it's eight, nine and three. So nine or more. No, we can't.

18:30.560 --> 18:39.680
And three that yes. And then 10, no. So yeah, 11, 12. It's a tendency again here, isn't it? But

18:40.560 --> 18:46.480
yeah, that people don't think it's possible that we're living in a simulation 13 and three has

18:46.480 --> 18:52.960
stayed stable in the yes answer. So yeah, it's, it's interesting really to just think about this,

18:52.960 --> 19:01.040
I would say, for say yes. Yeah. A lot more, a lot more certainty in this group than yesterday's group.

19:01.040 --> 19:04.720
Yesterday's group were all very skeptical and worried that they were dreaming and worried

19:04.720 --> 19:11.040
that they might be living in a simulation. You guys are a lot more sure of your place in reality.

19:11.600 --> 19:17.280
Okay, so thanks for taking part in that. I think it's useful to start thinking about these

19:17.280 --> 19:23.680
ontological questions, but I just want to distinguish between two sets of questions here,

19:23.680 --> 19:30.000
between ontology on the one hand and epistemology on the other hand. Epistemologies will be covered

19:30.000 --> 19:35.600
in next week's session, actually. So when we're thinking about ontology in relation to many of

19:35.600 --> 19:40.720
the issues we've just been discussing, we're thinking about questions, is there a reality

19:40.720 --> 19:46.960
beyond our experience of the world? And then what is the nature of that reality? Is it, for example,

19:46.960 --> 19:52.880
a simulation or not could be one such question? And what is the difference between reality and

19:52.880 --> 19:58.000
experience anyway? Even is there a difference? Whereas epistemology is very much more looking

19:58.000 --> 20:02.080
at questions of knowledge. What counts as knowledge? How is it that we can come to know

20:02.080 --> 20:07.040
anything? And can we be certain of anything? And what do we mean by truth? These are questions

20:07.040 --> 20:12.240
of epistemology that will be tackled next week. Now, some approaches kind of reject the distinction

20:12.240 --> 20:18.640
between these or try and blur the distinction. Critical realism tries to look at the two

20:18.640 --> 20:26.800
separately. And this week we'll be focusing on ontology. So I've got one more problem or question

20:26.800 --> 20:34.720
for you, which is about friendship, the idea of friendship. Now, do you think that friendship

20:34.720 --> 20:41.680
is just a way of describing the thoughts and actions of two individuals? Or is a friendship

20:41.680 --> 20:48.080
between, excuse me, two people also a real thing in its own right? So just to rephrase that I'll

20:48.080 --> 20:55.520
say it again, is friendship just a word we use, just as shorthand to describe what two individual

20:55.520 --> 21:02.960
people are doing? Or do you think that friendship is a real thing in the world? Is it some object or

21:02.960 --> 21:09.280
real thing? So I'd be very interested to hear your thoughts about this. Either put your responses

21:09.280 --> 21:16.080
in the chat box or raise your hand perhaps and we can get one or two people responding on the

21:16.080 --> 21:21.360
microphone. So yeah, do share some thoughts on this. While we wait here, I just wanted to take

21:21.360 --> 21:26.480
something that I find quite interesting in the chat. Those critical realism offer the red pill,

21:26.480 --> 21:33.520
so we can see what is really happening behind the simulation. And I just, why do I pick this?

21:33.520 --> 21:39.120
Because this is an interesting question that you will be kind of fleshing out throughout the six

21:39.120 --> 21:47.360
sessions. And I think today maybe it points to that. I don't have the answer, but it's interesting.

21:47.360 --> 21:54.160
And I hope that you can find some pointers, I think, in these six sessions.

21:55.920 --> 22:02.080
Yeah, so here we have it's ideationally real. I think friendship is real, but it is bound in time.

22:02.800 --> 22:09.680
Friendship is not an object, but it's real. So it's an entity. Yes, okay. Or the effect of friendship

22:09.680 --> 22:17.040
are real. Yeah, there we have the effects. Friendship is like wetting your pants. Everyone can see it,

22:17.040 --> 22:24.960
but only you know it's real warmth. That's a good way of describing it. I think friendship is real

22:24.960 --> 22:32.160
and has many layers. Yes, social, cultural, and personal layers. Yes, it's about the layers. That's

22:32.160 --> 22:37.200
a good point. It appears and disappears. But when it's there, it's certainly there.

22:38.000 --> 22:47.920
Yeah, great. Thank you. So many answers. Yeah, quite a lot of people who are giving critical

22:47.920 --> 22:54.800
realist answers as well. And I just want to clarify what that means just with one final

22:54.800 --> 23:03.120
slide here. From a critical realist perspective, how do we know something is real? So a kind of

23:03.120 --> 23:11.280
traditional criteria that Baskar points out is the perceptual criteria for reality. So if the

23:11.280 --> 23:17.360
phenomenon, say friendship, can be perceived, then it is real. But Baskar argues that that's not enough.

23:18.240 --> 23:24.000
That's not enough to decide whether something is real or not, because there are some things we

23:24.000 --> 23:29.600
perhaps can't perceive, but still want to insist they're real. So there's also the causal criteria

23:29.600 --> 23:34.880
for reality. And I think some people were getting at this in the chat box. For something to be real,

23:34.880 --> 23:41.360
it needs to be causally efficacious. That means it needs to be able to cause an effect in the

23:41.360 --> 23:48.480
world. It needs to create an outcome. So it may not be a cause that is triggered. So it may not

23:48.480 --> 23:53.040
be a cause that actually has an outcome, but it could be a cause that has the potential to have

23:53.040 --> 23:58.800
an outcome. So this causal criteria for reality is one we could apply for friendship. As somebody

23:58.800 --> 24:05.200
said there in the chat box, so a friendship has effects in the world. And this could be the basis

24:05.920 --> 24:12.160
of which we argue that is real. Okay, that's me done for this section on what is ontology.

24:12.160 --> 24:17.920
I'll just give you guys a moment to ask some questions if you want, using the Q&A feature,

24:17.920 --> 24:22.960
or to raise your hand and come in on the microphone. If you have any questions or want to

24:22.960 --> 24:28.880
share any thoughts at this point, and then in a moment we'll start the next session, the next section.

24:33.120 --> 24:34.240
Any questions?

24:44.560 --> 24:49.120
There's one hand up from Mauricio. Okay, yeah, Mauricio.

24:50.080 --> 24:56.240
Hi, I think one interesting question would be who cares or why care about

24:57.840 --> 25:03.280
the reality of reality from a critical realist perspective. Thank you.

25:03.840 --> 25:08.800
Okay, do you have any thoughts on that before we answer?

25:10.320 --> 25:17.760
Yes, I come from Sociologists of Discipline, so to me the fact that something is real is in that

25:17.760 --> 25:25.760
critical realist viewpoint means that it is in a way oppressive. It's something that happens,

25:25.760 --> 25:31.840
whether you want it or not, like paying bills. And therefore, it is important because

25:34.320 --> 25:38.480
things that are real are the things that can be analyzed, can be described, and so on.

25:39.360 --> 25:44.240
And I think it is important to distinguish between what is real and what is not,

25:44.960 --> 25:55.360
and in order to give enough, I think credence, but also weight, but also analytical importance

25:55.360 --> 26:01.040
to things that are real beyond the objectively perceptive and so on. So for me that's,

26:02.320 --> 26:08.240
I study how a constitution was made, so to me looking at that mechanism is important because

26:08.240 --> 26:12.320
it's a real mechanism that has real effects on the social structure, for example.

26:12.560 --> 26:19.680
Okay, brilliant. Yeah, I think you've answered the question very well. I'll just add one other

26:19.680 --> 26:25.680
thought which is thinking about a kind of discipline, a social science discipline,

26:25.680 --> 26:30.880
and going about establishing the theories and deciding what to research there. And I think

26:30.880 --> 26:37.040
when we're working out what isn't real, it's very important for deciding what the main concepts

26:37.040 --> 26:41.760
are going to be for the discipline. What are we going to investigate? What aspects of the world

26:41.840 --> 26:50.080
are we going to ask about or focus on? So I think that would be another aspect that builds on your

26:50.080 --> 26:55.920
thoughts there. Okay, brilliant. Caroline, any other thoughts or any other questions?

26:55.920 --> 27:01.520
Yeah, there are two things here. I want to say that one of the things that critical realism

27:01.520 --> 27:07.120
really advocates for is emancipation. And to be honest, I think what it really

27:07.680 --> 27:14.240
offers us is a theory of social change. I mean, I'm simplifying this. Not only it's a philosophy

27:14.240 --> 27:25.200
of science, but I think it is really geared to be able to intervene in the cogs of the machinery

27:25.200 --> 27:31.920
of society. And I think, yes, it is important to ask the question, who cares and why should we care?

27:31.920 --> 27:38.400
And there is where critical realism offers us tools and ways of thinking that we can then

27:39.200 --> 27:45.920
enact some change. Yeah, there is an interesting question here about friendship and structures.

27:45.920 --> 27:51.680
If it is a structure, although it's only between two people, I mean, can we say friendship is a

27:51.680 --> 27:56.880
social structure even only between two people? And that's an interesting question. Jack, I'm not sure

27:56.880 --> 28:05.520
if you have any thoughts around this. Is this really very nuanced things that makes us be confused

28:05.520 --> 28:11.120
at moments? Is it a structure because it's only between two people? Is one individual a structure?

28:11.120 --> 28:17.440
How is that? I think there are very differing, or my review is that there are very differing

28:17.440 --> 28:21.360
understandings of the word structure in the literature. So you always have to be careful

28:21.360 --> 28:28.960
when you're reading the word in a sociologist or even a critical realist. So I think Popora,

28:28.960 --> 28:33.600
who someone mentioned earlier, gives one of the best critical realist understandings of

28:33.600 --> 28:40.800
social structure. And he talks about relational structures between social positions in society.

28:40.800 --> 28:45.120
Tony Lawson is another one that gives a good understanding of structure here. So I would

28:45.120 --> 28:52.080
say that a friendship is part of the social structure, is part of relational social structures.

28:52.080 --> 28:57.840
Whether we say it's a structure in itself, I don't know, I think that depends on how you're

28:57.840 --> 29:03.440
using the word really. But I would certainly say that friendships are part of the social structure,

29:03.440 --> 29:08.800
relations between people, positioned people. And I think it will also, when you do your

29:08.800 --> 29:14.640
research, and if you are researching friendship in particular, you will then be reading different

29:14.640 --> 29:19.840
definitions and you will see what suits your investigation as well. So I think that that

29:19.840 --> 29:27.840
is something that is important. So yeah, it's fascinating so many. There are other questions

29:27.840 --> 29:34.240
in the chat. There is one which I think might be interesting about the difference between ontology

29:34.240 --> 29:43.280
and metaphysics. I would say this is a broad question that it might take more time than what

29:43.280 --> 29:50.800
we have to clarify. If there is any, I don't know, short answer there, Jack, I'm not sure. I think

29:50.800 --> 29:58.640
it's a really broad and deep question. Yeah, and maybe just one quick thought on the difference

29:58.640 --> 30:04.640
there would be that ontology tends to be concerned with the category, categories of things that are

30:04.640 --> 30:10.240
real. So what are the parts of the world that we define as real? And how do we kind of organize

30:10.240 --> 30:17.920
those categories? Whereas metaphysics as a whole tends to be thought of as a larger concern

30:17.920 --> 30:23.600
that includes those kind of skeptical questions I was asking at the start and is a broader question

30:23.600 --> 30:29.920
about the underlying natures and structures of the universe. Although there are clearly overlaps

30:29.920 --> 30:34.320
between the two, significant overlaps between the two, that's one way of thinking about the

30:34.320 --> 30:42.080
difference, perhaps. Yeah, okay, so I believe, and again, aware of the time and conscious of the

30:42.080 --> 30:49.600
time that we will continue with our second part, which will be more focused on the critical

30:49.600 --> 30:59.680
realist ontology and what is it in critical realism? That is defining of realities of what is real.

30:59.680 --> 31:06.320
And so if you go to the next slide, please, Jack. Yeah, so to begin with, we have always these two

31:06.320 --> 31:12.720
worlds, the natural world and the social world. And Baskar already in his critical naturalism

31:12.720 --> 31:20.880
says that these two worlds are not apart and he didn't want to make kind of a sharp difference.

31:20.880 --> 31:26.880
Nevertheless, he said, we can't reduce one to the other in so far that is critical. So the

31:26.880 --> 31:34.960
social world can't be reduced to the natural world. And it has its properties and it is, we have to

31:34.960 --> 31:43.840
study it as something that really emerges as part of the natural world. And so one of the things I

31:43.840 --> 31:50.320
think here that I, you can see underneath this pictures is that you in the natural world would

31:50.320 --> 31:56.320
do experimentation. So you have a closure really, your experiment is like a closure of that natural

31:56.320 --> 32:03.200
world. And then you want to predict and then find these causal laws, whereas in the social world,

32:03.200 --> 32:09.280
you would be exploring. And you can't do any closure because it is an open system. And we're

32:09.280 --> 32:15.360
going to go into into that open system definition in the next slide. And but what you can do really

32:15.360 --> 32:21.280
is explain, but you can't predict. I think this is one of the key things in critical realism.

32:21.920 --> 32:27.760
And if we go to the next slide, Jack, please. So here, I would say, are these kind of three

32:28.960 --> 32:40.240
main tenants of how social reality is defined in critical realism. And it's really stratified,

32:40.240 --> 32:45.760
it's deep, so we don't have a flat ontology, which is only what we can see. It's an open and

32:45.760 --> 32:51.280
complex system. So stratified. And we're going to I'm going to explain these three things in detail,

32:51.280 --> 32:57.760
but just stratified means that we have levels of reality. An open system means that this social

32:57.760 --> 33:04.160
world is really multi determined. So we have multiple causalities. And we don't know accurately

33:05.200 --> 33:12.720
these causes, which counter the other, which reinforce others, which cancel others. So it's

33:12.720 --> 33:17.280
really this kind of very multi determined space. And that's why it's an open system.

33:18.480 --> 33:27.280
And emergence is the property that emerges from systems that are complex. And so in I would say,

33:27.280 --> 33:34.320
and please, this is a simplification. Yeah, there is a lot of explanation deeper. And so that's

33:34.320 --> 33:40.240
the reading that you do. But this is just kind of to pinpoint main things. So you can't really

33:40.240 --> 33:44.960
rely on on empirical data, if you want to answer your research question from a critical

33:44.960 --> 33:51.920
realist perspective, because the world is much more than than what we can see, perceive, and you

33:51.920 --> 34:02.640
know, what catches the eye. And the next one, Jack, please. And here this, this metaphor of the iceberg,

34:02.640 --> 34:08.080
I think, not me, many think that it's a very good metaphor to explain this stratified or

34:08.080 --> 34:13.680
stratification of reality. And although I'm going to start from the bottom up, because I think

34:14.720 --> 34:20.800
in the in this kind of the iceberg really tells us that if an iceberg is to stand there for million

34:20.800 --> 34:27.920
and millions of years, it's because it has a strong mass underneath the water, and it gives

34:27.920 --> 34:32.560
its solidity. And I think that's a really good thing to think about when we are investigating

34:33.520 --> 34:39.040
social reality under a critical realist perspective. So these generative mechanisms,

34:39.040 --> 34:45.520
which are those that make things happen in the world, they live underneath of what we can see,

34:45.520 --> 34:51.280
they're really invisible, most of the times, at first sight, I mean, here. Then what happens is

34:51.280 --> 34:56.560
that these generative mechanisms interact with each other and then events happen. But these

34:56.560 --> 35:01.920
events not necessarily can be observed all the time. So they live also underneath the water,

35:01.920 --> 35:07.440
but they happen, although we can't see them when these generative mechanisms interact with each

35:07.440 --> 35:14.000
other. And then what happens is at the empirical level are these events that we really can observe.

35:14.000 --> 35:20.880
But this is only just the 10% of that reality that we're investigating. So again, I think the main

35:20.880 --> 35:29.040
takeaway here is don't trust what you can see and just go deeper. Yeah, the next one, please.

35:29.840 --> 35:35.200
And so this is really, again, just kind of putting together these ideas of we start with

35:35.200 --> 35:40.640
the empirical level, because yes, it's what we can see. It's what we talk with our participants,

35:40.640 --> 35:46.160
is what we find out about the reality we are interested in. But this only opens the door

35:46.720 --> 35:52.480
through then using theory that allows you then to go to this deeper level where the structures

35:52.480 --> 35:59.200
and this generative power or mechanism are, I would say, hidden most of the times. And that's

35:59.200 --> 36:04.880
why emancipation, I think for me at least, is something that we really thrive for when we

36:04.880 --> 36:09.760
use critical realism. What is that invisible thing that is, and someone said oppressive,

36:09.760 --> 36:15.120
yes, these structures normally are oppressive. So how can we really see them? The next one, please,

36:15.120 --> 36:25.280
Jack. And the open system that I was mentioning before is, I think I don't have to explain that

36:25.280 --> 36:32.640
much, but what it really means is that the social world is a causal network of interacting forces

36:32.640 --> 36:40.320
that counteract each other, reinforce each other, cancel sometimes. So it's very difficult to really

36:40.320 --> 36:48.720
say something in a predictive manner. So if A is here, B will happen. It's not necessarily the case.

36:48.720 --> 36:54.400
And so you can't really make any closure. You have to be always aware that you can only say

36:54.400 --> 37:01.840
so much about social reality. The next one, please, Jack. And what this really brings us to think about

37:01.840 --> 37:07.600
that we are not working with causal laws. We're really doing multiple causality. That's what

37:07.600 --> 37:12.880
we're looking for. Are there multiple causes that are responsible for the event that we are

37:12.880 --> 37:18.720
investigating? And human beings are themselves open systems. And I was thinking about this when

37:18.720 --> 37:25.440
you asked about the question of structure and friendship. So we are open systems and we're

37:25.440 --> 37:32.160
capable of communication, creativity and resistance. This means that there is always the

37:32.160 --> 37:38.320
possibility of something new happening. And this, I think, is an evidence that we really can't predict

37:38.320 --> 37:42.320
because there is always something new happening. There is always some creation that we have not

37:42.320 --> 37:48.480
expected or that is not. We couldn't really predict for that. The next one, please, Jack.

37:49.600 --> 37:56.800
And the phenomenon of emergence, I think, is quite interesting because it refers to the

37:56.800 --> 38:03.360
properties that arise when different parts constitute a whole. And the flock of birds is

38:03.360 --> 38:10.560
an example that I have used to illustrate this because I think it really makes the case of how,

38:11.440 --> 38:18.080
when birds are together, things arise. So an emergent entity is constituted by the parts,

38:18.080 --> 38:25.040
how they are arranged in relation to one another. And the unique properties, the whole holds

38:25.040 --> 38:30.400
due to the arrangement of the parts. So what we can see here, I would say three important things,

38:30.400 --> 38:37.840
the parts, the arrangement of these parts. How are they arranged? And then they form this whole

38:37.840 --> 38:45.440
and what is this whole? And if we go to the next slide, there is a more precise explanation of this,

38:45.440 --> 38:51.600
which is really, this is from National Geographic, a study about flock of birds. And what I want to

38:51.600 --> 38:58.000
take from this example is that, so I'm going to read the left hand side. While it sounds like

38:58.000 --> 39:04.960
waves spread best in bigger flocks, the waves transmitting information about direction spread

39:04.960 --> 39:12.080
best in smaller flocks. So here we can see how the size of the flock matters for the effect

39:12.080 --> 39:17.440
or the property that is going to emerge, namely how they change direction when they do their

39:17.440 --> 39:25.680
emigration, or also sometimes when they arrive to a particular space. So smaller flocks tend to

39:25.680 --> 39:33.520
have a more rigid behavior, if you wish, because the waves travel more quickly. So what I want to

39:35.120 --> 39:40.320
stress here is that the way in which these birds are arranged, is there a big flock,

39:40.320 --> 39:46.800
is it a small flock, really determines the effect of the transmission of the information

39:46.800 --> 39:51.920
about the direction. And I think that is key, although this is in the natural world, but

39:51.920 --> 39:59.200
Pascal said they're not different. They are in a way different, but they are as well together.

39:59.200 --> 40:06.320
So the next slide, please. And the same thing happens here with fish, shawls, it is exactly the

40:06.320 --> 40:10.400
same, how they behave together is completely different than what they do by themselves.

40:11.120 --> 40:21.040
And the next one, please, Jack. What is really the aim of social science and OSAS researcher

40:21.680 --> 40:27.360
is to discover these emergent properties. So the entities, the agents, the structure,

40:27.360 --> 40:31.760
and their emergent generative power, this is really, or the mechanism, what social

40:31.760 --> 40:38.960
science is about. All of this is within a critical realist perspective. And this in society,

40:38.960 --> 40:45.760
if you go to the next slide, Jack, what it allows us really to see here, and I'm not going to read

40:45.760 --> 40:51.120
all of that. I'm conscious about the time. I'm going to just go to the last bit. A context where

40:51.120 --> 40:57.120
the resources are allocated unevenly will have different effects on the individuals that operate

40:57.120 --> 41:03.680
within it. And here we see the whole is the society, how the parts, which in this case are the resources,

41:03.680 --> 41:09.840
are allocated, how these are arranged in a society have effects and they have different

41:09.840 --> 41:14.800
effects. If you think about Latin America, I'm going to talk about Venezuela, particularly my

41:14.800 --> 41:22.320
experience to not generalize resources are incredibly unevenly allocated. Now, how society

41:22.320 --> 41:29.520
lives there is incredibly different than if we think about Norway or England, although I know

41:29.520 --> 41:34.480
things are changing, but nevertheless, the resources are allocated in a different way than

41:34.480 --> 41:40.880
in Venezuela. And we see how society and its individuals have completely different effects

41:40.880 --> 41:45.360
in how they live. And then that does as well as we are, you know, that then brings to different

41:45.360 --> 41:53.840
and different consequences. And so I think with this, I think that if you go to the next slide,

41:53.840 --> 42:00.640
I think this is the, yeah, that the so what I believe is important here is that we look at

42:00.640 --> 42:06.640
these three things. So how can we go to these deeper layers of society or social reality, sorry,

42:06.640 --> 42:13.440
how we should not stay in the empirical, how we always need to be conscious that what we are

42:13.440 --> 42:20.400
investigating is an open system. And in every open system, it's we have this complexity when things

42:20.400 --> 42:29.280
just come together. And in the coming together, and here is I think the social structures as

42:29.280 --> 42:36.800
Tony Lawson defines is the this is really about the positions of these parts. So I think here,

42:37.520 --> 42:41.680
yeah, those are the three things that we should kind of take into account when we investigate.

42:41.680 --> 42:46.080
And these generative powers are really the object of analysis, what are they and what are they doing?

42:46.640 --> 42:53.280
And I, yeah, if you have any questions, I think this is a good time to just break a bit

42:54.800 --> 42:59.360
the talking. And any question, if someone would like to take the mic, I think there are some

42:59.360 --> 43:05.680
questions. Yeah, so there's there's a few questions that have that I've dug out of the chat. So if you

43:05.680 --> 43:11.680
do have questions, please pop them in the Q&A section, just make some a bit easier for us to

43:11.680 --> 43:15.840
find an answer, especially when there's a few coming in at once. But just I want to go back to a

43:15.840 --> 43:24.640
few that came out of the chat from from earlier on. And so we have one from Stephen, with the

43:24.640 --> 43:31.360
that I think builds on the discussion of friendship, saying wouldn't this imply that ideas as real as

43:31.360 --> 43:39.760
objects. And I think that's a really interesting question. And I would I would personally say

43:39.760 --> 43:45.680
yes, I mean, it depends what you mean by as real as something, but just just to kind of just define

43:45.680 --> 43:52.480
and back the answer up. And if you think about the human individual, and argue that the URIs

43:52.480 --> 43:58.240
an individual person is real, then we could say that actually, we're just made up of smaller parts,

43:58.240 --> 44:02.320
as Caroline has just been saying, and that those are real, and that those are made up of smaller

44:02.320 --> 44:08.400
parts, and those are real. So unless we believe that there's some bottom layer of reality from

44:08.400 --> 44:14.000
which that is the only thing that's real, if we want to claim that we as people and other

44:14.000 --> 44:20.000
objects we see around us are real, and I think it makes just as much sense to say that ideas and

44:20.000 --> 44:25.760
social structures that emerge from us are real objects. And one final thought on this building

44:25.760 --> 44:32.880
on the causal criteria for reality is that critical realists talk about reasons being causes,

44:32.880 --> 44:37.760
and the way that the reasons we do things, the justifications for things, the ideas we have

44:37.760 --> 44:44.960
about things can be causes. So hopefully that answers the question, but do come back in the chat

44:44.960 --> 44:50.800
or by raising a hand if you want to. Caroline, were there other questions? I have a couple more

44:50.800 --> 44:55.760
here, but I don't know if you have any at your side. I'm just looking at the Q&A, but I think we'll

44:55.760 --> 45:01.120
leave them to the end. Is that right? Okay, yeah. Daniel has a hand raised. Daniel, did you want to

45:01.120 --> 45:10.560
come in? I just would be interested. I know that Pascal is making a difference between a transitive

45:10.560 --> 45:19.200
and intransitive dimension. Would that not be an important concept to discuss friendship?

45:20.640 --> 45:24.800
Okay, just want to elaborate on that a little bit just to clarify.

45:24.800 --> 45:31.200
Sorry, I didn't understand. What do you mean? Yeah, could you just say a little bit more just

45:31.200 --> 45:38.720
to be clear on why that you think that relates to friendship? Yeah, I'm just good to have it.

45:40.000 --> 45:49.840
Okay, I'm not totally sure, but I would say that Pascal would say that in a friendship as I wrote

45:49.840 --> 45:58.080
in the chat that there are different layers of friendship. And perhaps regarding a personal

45:58.080 --> 46:09.520
friendship, I have with somebody that something that can change quite quickly. But the concept

46:09.520 --> 46:16.800
of friendship, what we do think of friendship is something we have in our culture. And that's not

46:16.800 --> 46:24.320
that easy to change our ideas. And I think if I understand Pascal right, he would even say that

46:25.760 --> 46:31.280
behind the concept and our cultural ideas about friendship, there is something deeper

46:31.280 --> 46:40.000
in reality and a lethic level where friendship is real and does not change. Would you agree?

46:40.400 --> 46:49.120
Okay, yeah, no, I think I would agree. That's really interesting. So we have the transitive

46:49.120 --> 46:56.880
dimension being the dimension of knowledge and knowing and the tools of understanding, so to

46:56.880 --> 47:02.640
speak, the way in which we understand and explain the world and the intransitive being the world

47:02.640 --> 47:07.760
itself, the thing we're studying and looking at. So I'm really just repeating your answer back to

47:07.760 --> 47:14.160
you, Daniel, but just for clarity for some of those who are listening. And so when we're talking

47:14.160 --> 47:20.080
about the transitive, we're thinking about how we see friendship as a society, perhaps how we see

47:20.080 --> 47:27.200
friendship as sociologists, maybe, as well. But then there is something real going on as well

47:27.200 --> 47:33.040
underneath there. There are causal mechanisms that mean that a friendship between two people can have

47:33.040 --> 47:39.200
effects in the world. It's real regardless of whether other people acknowledge it or notice it

47:39.200 --> 47:45.680
or study it or not. So I think that's the idea of the distinction there. And hopefully that's

47:45.680 --> 47:52.320
answered the question. Please do come back if not. Caroline, is there anything else to pick up on?

47:52.320 --> 47:58.560
No, well, I think that if it has effects, this is one thing where we then need to say, okay,

47:58.560 --> 48:04.400
wait, let me go deeper here. Let me think about this. I think this is really the kind of first

48:05.200 --> 48:11.520
thing where you say, okay, this has effects. And that's the criteria that we used in our last slide

48:11.520 --> 48:17.440
to when something is real and when it's causally efficacious. So I think that is really something

48:17.440 --> 48:26.640
to think about. But yeah, brilliant. Even Daniel was saying it, right? We've got quite a few of the

48:26.720 --> 48:31.520
questions here. Shall we take these or should we take the next section and come back to them all at

48:31.520 --> 48:40.720
the end? I suggest, yeah, we don't have that much to go. So we could take the next section and then

48:40.720 --> 48:45.280
we start with our Q&A. And in our last half an hour, I would say that would be great.

48:45.280 --> 48:51.120
Okay, that's a good idea. So we don't have, yeah, we only have a couple of slides left each. So we'll

48:51.120 --> 48:56.320
say this and then we'll open a bit more space for others to come in and to answer some of these

48:56.320 --> 49:01.440
other questions that are in the chat and Q&A. Brilliant. Okay, so thinking about the implications

49:01.440 --> 49:06.400
of a critical realist ontology, I just want to quickly look at a few philosophical implications.

49:06.400 --> 49:12.560
There are perhaps a lot more than I've summarised on this slide here, but just to raise a few.

49:12.560 --> 49:17.760
So firstly, one implication is that there is a reality beyond our experience of it.

49:18.720 --> 49:23.360
So I think that's, I suppose, might be obvious to some people, but is an important

49:23.920 --> 49:29.600
point to make when we're conducting social science and to be aware of that there is a

49:29.600 --> 49:35.120
reality beyond our experience. Perhaps more controversially, the implication of critical

49:35.120 --> 49:40.240
realism is that there's a reality beyond actual events. So there are potential causes that could

49:40.240 --> 49:45.760
have been triggered or could have happened that didn't. And we can think about these as being

49:45.760 --> 49:53.120
part of the real, these causal mechanisms or causal properties of entities. And there's this

49:53.120 --> 49:58.240
point that reality is not necessarily how it appears to us, which raises that problem about

49:58.240 --> 50:05.280
whether we can be sure about the world around us and about reality, which gives us that fallibility

50:06.400 --> 50:10.720
although we can generate knowledge on the basis of assumptions we find compelling,

50:10.720 --> 50:16.800
we can't be 100% sure we might always be wrong. So, and then finally, I just want to go to these

50:16.800 --> 50:21.360
bullet points at the bottom of the slide and highlight that when we're conducting research,

50:22.160 --> 50:29.760
we need to consider both causality and meaning. So traditionally, positivists have focused on

50:29.760 --> 50:35.200
causality and interpretivists have focused on understanding meaning. Critical realism calls

50:35.440 --> 50:42.080
for us to do both to try and explain society and explain causality and to understand meaning as well.

50:42.080 --> 50:48.720
We need to focus on both structures and agents, so both the social context in which people live

50:48.720 --> 50:54.480
and their unique kind of creative powers as individual agents to make change in the world.

50:55.520 --> 51:00.160
We need to understand relations between people, so those friendships we were talking about,

51:00.240 --> 51:04.720
but maybe also those, or maybe even more importantly, those economic relationships

51:04.720 --> 51:12.160
like landlord and tenant, for example, or employer and employee. But then we also need to understand

51:12.160 --> 51:18.640
and think about relations between ideas and the way in which two ideas might contradict one another

51:18.640 --> 51:24.800
and this might have causal consequences in the world. Archer talked a lot about this in her

51:24.800 --> 51:31.760
theory on culture and uses examples from religion where contradictions arise in the Bible and that

51:31.760 --> 51:37.920
has a causal impact on how society develops. And then finally, we need to think about both the

51:37.920 --> 51:46.400
natural and social. So as Caroline has said, critical realism insists that we need a kind

51:46.400 --> 51:51.440
of general philosophy for understanding both and although the social world is very different in

51:51.440 --> 51:57.440
lots of ways, we need to be aware of both. And when we're studying society or our various

51:57.440 --> 52:04.800
disciplines in social science, we need to be aware of our bodies and the physical world around us

52:04.800 --> 52:11.120
as well as the kind of ideas and discussion and language and discourse, etc. Okay, so those are

52:11.120 --> 52:16.240
just a quick run through some philosophical implications. I hand over to Caroline for more

52:16.240 --> 52:23.280
practical implications. Yes. And thank you, Jack. I want to again insist that these implications,

52:23.920 --> 52:31.200
particularly the practical ones, are going to be kind of unfolding along these seminars.

52:31.920 --> 52:36.560
So I do encourage you to go to all of them because I'm just kind of, you know,

52:36.560 --> 52:45.120
I'm even touching the tip of the iceberg because there are epistemological implications which

52:45.120 --> 52:53.040
are going to be addressed in the second seminar. One thing that in my experience, I have experienced

52:53.040 --> 52:58.960
myself, is very important, is the critical realism so that philosophy of science has an

52:58.960 --> 53:05.200
immediate implication in my research design or in our research design. What is the methodology?

53:05.200 --> 53:10.720
Which are the methods I'm going to use to collect which data? Is it enough? Does it

53:10.720 --> 53:18.240
allow me to go deeper? Or does it open the door to then go deeper? And I think that is one of the

53:18.240 --> 53:27.920
key things that, yeah, one needs to be aware if I'm using this, okay, what are the implications for

53:27.920 --> 53:33.920
my methodology for my design of my investigation? And it's always important to ask, what is the

53:33.920 --> 53:39.040
nature of the object that we're investigating? What is it made of? What are the constituent parts?

53:39.200 --> 53:47.680
What are these? How are they? I think Jack was saying these kind of basic concepts, which are

53:47.680 --> 53:56.000
they? I need to really be very aware that that is very, very important. And if you read, I think

53:56.000 --> 54:00.800
someone made that comment in the chat at the beginning, the guide that Tom Fryer did, which is

54:00.800 --> 54:07.120
really an amazing work, that also I think signals, at least for me, a deep understanding and that's

54:07.120 --> 54:12.800
why he's able to do the comics of it, because it's a deep understanding that has been really put to

54:12.800 --> 54:18.080
and brought to another level. So you don't go looking for something that doesn't exist. And so you

54:18.080 --> 54:24.400
don't ignore the full reality of the world. And if you set up off with a bad theory of ontology,

54:25.520 --> 54:30.880
you really are risking that you'll end up with a math project or, yeah, or just,

54:31.120 --> 54:39.280
yeah, it can go really wrong, I have to say, if our ontology is not well determined and defined.

54:39.280 --> 54:46.720
And if we have this kind of, yeah, this position that we are clear about. And I think in this seminar

54:46.720 --> 54:52.320
of this morning, we have very experienced people with not only PhD students, but people that are

54:53.040 --> 55:01.360
more experienced. Nevertheless, I would like to just make a comment. I arrived quite late to

55:01.360 --> 55:08.240
critical realism. And I came also from a very practical space. I was a math teacher, which I'm

55:08.240 --> 55:13.760
still, but I worked a lot in this kind of teaching environment with a more pragmatic approach to

55:13.760 --> 55:21.920
what I was doing. And when I confronted myself with doing a PhD and thinking about ontology and

55:21.920 --> 55:29.920
epistemology, I would say I think I didn't take it that seriously at the time, because I was ignorant

55:29.920 --> 55:38.880
really. And I changed at a later stage, but I took a year to understand what is this ontology really

55:38.880 --> 55:47.040
about. And once I have it clear, then I could do all the rest. And so I just want to say that,

55:47.040 --> 55:55.200
yes, it is important to have a clear ontological stance and being aware of what are these implications.

55:55.840 --> 56:04.000
And I think with this, we've come to an end. And we go to our Q&A. I think it's great with

56:05.600 --> 56:13.760
our time. And we have some questions here in the Q&A. So, yeah, any questions, I think,

56:13.840 --> 56:18.560
from this, or shall we just, and yeah, someone was asking about a reference, and I just said

56:18.560 --> 56:23.920
they are here in these slides. And we're going to put the link to the slides in the critical

56:23.920 --> 56:34.320
realist network site at the end of today. So, yeah, there's so much going on in the chat.

56:37.120 --> 56:42.240
Sorry, I was just trying to find my unmute button there. Yeah, just before we go to the Q&A,

56:42.240 --> 56:47.200
I think we've picked up everything in the chat. If you've asked questions in the chat,

56:47.200 --> 56:51.840
and we've not touched on them, please pop them into the Q&A. We'll make sure we get to all those

56:51.840 --> 56:59.040
there. I just want to pick up on one other that was asked by Christopher, which is whether

56:59.040 --> 57:08.480
objects have agency. And this depends on how we use the word objects. And I just want to say that

57:08.480 --> 57:16.960
you will find the word objects and objective used in so many different ways in the literature

57:16.960 --> 57:22.160
about ontology and epistemology. So, be very wary when you see that word and try and read

57:22.160 --> 57:27.600
around it to understand what the author is saying. In my own kind of understanding, I would say that

57:27.600 --> 57:35.360
yes, objects can have agency because we are both objects and agents. Our body has a physical

57:35.360 --> 57:41.920
existence in the world that makes it an object that can kind of knock against things or we can

57:41.920 --> 57:48.400
walk into things, etc. But also it has an internal existence that is able to think and

57:49.680 --> 57:54.400
has a kind of unique creative capacity in the world to observe and

57:56.320 --> 58:02.720
to make change and to kind of accept or reject ideas, etc. So I would say that's one way in

58:02.720 --> 58:10.560
which objects have agency. And then there's various kind of guess work about what other

58:10.560 --> 58:17.120
objects have agency. We assume animals have agency to some extent as well and then I will

58:17.120 --> 58:21.920
leave it up to your own imagination to see how much further you want to take that. Some people

58:21.920 --> 58:26.880
might argue that society as a whole has some consciousness or agency. I'm not personally

58:26.880 --> 58:31.920
convinced by that one, but that is a position that some people argue. And I suppose it's one of the

58:31.920 --> 58:38.800
reasons that critical realism is often compatible with religious approaches, though I'm not myself

58:38.800 --> 58:44.240
religious, other people within critical realism are. So that's quite a broad question. Answer to

58:44.240 --> 58:48.480
your question, but hopefully that's helpful. Caroline, did you want to pick a question?

58:48.480 --> 58:54.720
Yeah, I think a Hindi. I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing well the name, but I had a question that I

58:54.720 --> 59:01.200
asked. And again, him or her, I'm not sure if the name, because I'm not familiar with it, but

59:01.200 --> 59:05.760
if you can put that question in the Q&A, because it was a question about structure and agency,

59:05.760 --> 59:13.200
which I think is quite important, it's about how can social structure be applied, contextualized

59:13.200 --> 59:19.040
at individual levels or the micro level in relation to human agency. So you're specifically

59:19.040 --> 59:26.240
talking about structure and agency relationships at the individual level. And yeah, I just wanted

59:26.240 --> 59:35.520
to say, I think the work of Margaret Archer is illustrative for this. She, her work on

59:35.520 --> 59:42.240
reflexivity and the inner conversation, she has two books about that, the one of, yeah, I think

59:42.240 --> 59:52.880
it's 2017, if I'm not wrong. But so she offers, and her, as well, I think her morphogenetic cycle

59:52.880 --> 01:00:00.000
really allows you to think about the agency and this kind of how your inner conversation

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:07.680
is something really important, because it's what mediates your agency. Now, I would suggest there

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:15.520
is another Paolo Donati, who has worked with her in the relational subject. And I think Donati has

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:22.240
a more social approach to reflexive engagement, what the inner conversation, there is a critique

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:28.880
that we don't talk only to ourselves, we talk with others. And the inner conversation is not,

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:34.320
it's not the only thing that mediates agency, there are other, other conversations, if you wish. So

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:40.560
I hope to answer that question, Kehinde, I think that will allow you to, to explore this, this

01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:45.680
question deeper with Archer's work. Yeah. Thank you, Jack, for putting that reference there.

01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:51.360
Can I just also say that I know there are a few people here who've read quite a lot of critical

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:56.960
realism. So I don't want this to be the case that Caroline and I, the experts and you guys are all

01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:02.000
asking the questions. If you have any contributions to add to what we're saying, that would be great

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:11.680
too. So please raise a hand and jump into the, to the discussion. Okay, so shall we pick up

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:22.000
another question here. Question from Mateus, do the natural and social overlap,

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:28.640
some social structures maybe influenced by the natural? Yeah, absolutely. So I think one, one

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:36.240
way of thinking about this is in terms of emergence. So the idea that the social emerges from the

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:41.760
natural. And when we use that word emergence, we're not necessarily talking about over time

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:48.400
here. We're thinking in any particular moment, there is the natural world that includes our

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:56.640
bodies and human made objects, for example. But from that, that natural world of atoms and cells

01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:03.920
and biology emerges the social world of agency and thought and then social structures and ideas,

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:10.080
etc. So that would be one way in which they overlap that one emerges from the other. But then

01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:15.440
thinking introducing time into the equation and thinking about this over time, we can say that

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:22.960
of course they interact constantly on, you know, a second by second basis, the natural and the

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:30.320
social world interacting. And I think exploring the interaction between them is a really important

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:35.360
kind of approach to social analysis. So yeah, really good question. Thanks. Please come in

01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:38.960
and raise your hand if you want to add anything to that.

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:48.720
Christopher, I'm not sure, Jack, if you, if you did answer this question, because I'm not that great

01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:53.680
at multitasking and hearing and reading at the same time. But I think it's a, it's a, it's a

01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:59.280
question that is interesting. Can we distinguish the stratified levels of actual empirical and real

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:05.600
in data? So for example, interview data, document analysis, when doing qualitative research about

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:14.800
a particular social phenomenon, phenomena. So do you have any, any particular answer to this,

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:22.960
Jack, first to begin with? I, I, sorry, I was in the chat there. Just give me a moment. Yeah. So I

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:32.080
think in, in, I believe that this is our task as social researcher is to find the tools we need

01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:40.800
to be able to, if the data does not allow us to go to that deeper level, which I think it doesn't

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:47.840
necessarily happen. So for example, if I, if I, if, if my entry point would be focus groups and I

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:54.160
do some discussion using a particular, you know, activity, and I want to trigger some conversations

01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:59.120
about digital engagements, for example, with tools, how do you engage with what you engage, why you

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:09.040
engage, that data will only allow me to uncover this 10% the empirical level. If I want to go

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:15.760
deeper and explore these mechanisms that are there, I certainly need to put the theory in the

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:22.160
context of my research. Yes, I can't just say, you know, forget about my data and then go and look

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:30.400
for the theory that will allow me to identify which are the mechanisms that are responsible,

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:36.880
as we know, in an open system for these, for example, in my case, the lack of engagement.

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:45.040
Then I think you need to, with that in mind and your data, you need to go to the theory.

01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:50.560
And there is where that combination, your experience as a practitioner in the field,

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:56.000
and having read quite a bit about the structures that you're exploring, I think you put them

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:01.600
together, but not necessarily the data allows you per se to go deeper into those levels. That's

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:07.200
how I see it. I'm not sure if there is another, and again, as Jack said, if anyone in the audience

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:15.360
would like to chip in, we're happy to do that because, yeah, that's kind of, yeah, my experience with it.

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:27.600
Okay, so I'm reading some of these questions. Yeah, I'm just just looking at the questions

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:35.440
to think of which one to answer. Maria is saying here, how do we know that we are actually unpacking

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:43.680
real as that unpacking is dependent on our perceptions? And this is a question I asked

01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:52.160
myself a year and a half and every day, you know, how do I know that what I'm doing is real?

01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:58.800
And yeah, Jack, if you want to jump into that one. Yeah. And so two thoughts on that one.

01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:05.440
The first would be perhaps a bit of an unsatisfactory answer, but would be to say that critical

01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:10.000
realism does insist on the fallibility of knowledge. I think I mentioned this to someone

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:17.200
in the chat earlier that critical realism is not offering kind of 100% certainty

01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:22.080
in everything it does. Rather, it's trying to find the most compelling and convincing

01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:33.680
understanding of reality using introspection and logic and as well as kind of our existing theories

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:38.960
and empirical understandings of the world. So it's trying to build the most compelling case

01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:46.640
on the basis of that. On the other hand, perhaps, or hopefully giving a slightly more convincing

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:56.800
or slightly more satisfactory answer, hopefully, is that I think if we look at Baskar's argument

01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:03.520
that there are underlying causal mechanisms in reality, I think there is, I personally find that

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:10.480
quite compelling because he asks what, how does the world have to be for us to kind of experience

01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:15.760
it this way? How does the world have to be for science to be possible? He argues. So I would say

01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:21.840
that although there are those skeptical challenges we were talking about earlier,

01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:28.880
there is a degree of security we can have in our beliefs, even if we can't have certainty,

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:32.720
because our experiences of the world, especially when we talk to others and they have similar

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:39.920
experiences, do help us see or help us kind of follow the logic that Baskar's arguing.

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:46.400
Yeah, not a fully satisfactory answer, I'm aware, but hopefully that helps and I'd be interested

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:54.720
to hear other thoughts on that too. Yes, I think it's, yeah, it's not, and again,

01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:58.560
you know, I don't think, I think the fallibility is something really important here and that's

01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:02.560
going to happen. The epistemology you're going to, in the next seminar, you're going to explore that

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:11.280
deeper. But that's, I think that is an important part of the answer. Just picking another question

01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:20.160
from the Q&A, which is again, this is quite blurry, but the question is quite interesting

01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:25.920
regarding objects of study. The motto, don't go looking for something that doesn't exist,

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:32.560
seems sensible, but what about concepts that are intensely contested, or that many people

01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:39.360
would question the basis of? And I think here, critical realism is interesting to work with

01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:50.320
contested ideas. Are they real? Are they not real? And I would say this is kind of

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:57.920
reducing, again, the complexity of this philosophy of science, making a reduction in this instant

01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:04.320
that I'm talking to you, which means this is not the only answer to this. But I think there is this

01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:10.240
question, is it real? And if it's real, then I will study it using critical realism. Again, I'm in

01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:17.120
this philosophy of science. So if it's not real, then I need to go for what is then the real aspect

01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:22.640
of this phenomenon that I'm investigating. I think that's how I would approach this. And myself,

01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:29.600
I'm looking at datafication as a phenomenon. Is it real? And why is it real? It's very contested.

01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:39.280
What is it? What is it not? So I think, yeah, you know, and the basis of the real, again,

01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:49.040
what you can say about is not definite, is not uncriticisable or academically,

01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:55.200
you can always critique it and find a better explanation where you can say, well, you know

01:09:55.200 --> 01:10:01.840
what, I think this is not real because that I'm here, I'm offering maybe this aspect of it

01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:05.040
is real. And that's why it is, I think that is the way to go.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:17.360
Thanks. And can I just pick up on the question from Gonzague and apologies by mispronouncing that.

01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:23.360
Why do social researchers still not use critical realism in their inquiries?

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:31.280
What likely explanations could you provide on this issue? So it's difficult to kind of explain

01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:36.800
why others aren't using your theory. I think that's always a problem with any kind of belief,

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:43.600
but just to share a couple of thoughts on that. One would be from my own discipline,

01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:49.120
political science at least, and I'm sure it applies to others, that there isn't as much

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:56.720
critical reflection about our underlying ontologies and epistemologies as there should be.

01:10:56.720 --> 01:11:01.920
It's something that lots of us learn at master's or PhD level. And then when lots of social

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:07.760
scientists go out to conduct research, the pressures of the academic world, perhaps,

01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:12.960
and lots of other reasons might mean that they focus a lot less on their underlying ontology

01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:18.720
and epistemology. So there is a kind of general lack of criticality that we could think about.

01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:23.440
That would be one side of the explanation. And I think the other side of the explanation comes

01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:30.400
from the influentialness of post-structuralism, and particularly the work of Foucault and others,

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:37.520
and those who have built on Foucault's work, who rejects the idea that the world contains

01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:44.640
objects with essences, who reject the idea that the world contains structures, and instead

01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:52.240
emphasise the fluidity and contingency of the world to the extent that there are no

01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:57.440
entities within it. And I think there are lots of problems with that philosophical approach.

01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:04.800
It's been very influential via Foucault and Judith Butler and others. I would personally

01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:08.800
disagree with it, but I think that's one of the reasons that critical realism isn't more widely

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:13.840
used, because those who do reflect on their ontology and epistemology are often taking

01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:19.200
this alternative post-structurist approach. So I think for those engaging with critical

01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:24.960
realism as a theory in their thesis or research, that debate between critical realism and

01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:30.800
post-structuralism I think is very helpful in outlining and defending a critical realist approach.

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:40.400
Yeah, and Stephen is saying that his supervisor says it's a cult, and I'm reminded by Ben Mansky,

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:48.240
who is part of the group of people organising the seminar, saying that in the United States,

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:54.800
where he is working, it's the same thing. It is something that is very, very much criticised as

01:12:54.800 --> 01:13:01.360
a cult. And you know, again, I think there is really here, for me, my experience at least,

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:08.160
it needs to catch you. It needs to really ring a bell when you're doing your research. You just

01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:14.000
kind of say, wow, this really is what I was looking for. This allows me to explain the

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:20.320
unexplainable until I got this, this kind of this philosophical approach to social science.

01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:28.000
So I think also you need to really be, you're always going to be uncomfortable because I think

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.320
that is really what knowledge generates in us when we are creating this thing that we really

01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:37.280
don't know. We're in this kind of really space where we don't know. But I think critical realism,

01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:43.280
you know, it can be for different people, different things. And don't let yourself,

01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:50.960
how do you say be deterred from using it? Because everyone, you know, they're people that defend,

01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:59.120
you know, let's say new materialism, which has been a new, which also has a part of realism,

01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:06.400
because Barat talks about agential realism. But there are, you know, there are people critiquing

01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:13.840
this fiercely, others taking it and writing books. And so it's really, I think, what you,

01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:20.480
your hunch, your inner investigator voice, what is it saying to you? And then you go

01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:24.720
and explore it deep and you will be able to answer questions and, you know, and argue for

01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:29.280
your position. It's not an easy one. Yeah, go for it.

01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:30.480
Sorry, Caroline, after you.

01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:31.520
No, go ahead, go ahead.

01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:37.680
Yeah, I just wanted to come in and add to that, which is, as I said earlier, that quite a lot

01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:45.440
of people who use critical realism also hold religious positions. And although I don't myself,

01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:52.240
I'm personally an atheist. I think that often puts people off and people almost take the attitude

01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:58.160
that religion doesn't have a place in social theory. But I would suggest that if you're religious,

01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:03.520
then religion does have a place in social theory, because it is about your ontology

01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:08.160
and how you understand the world to be. And we should be making that explicit and debating

01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:14.480
and discussing it rather than trying to keep it separate. So that's one point. And I think the

01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:22.160
other is that maybe some critical realist texts focus too much on only the critical realist tools

01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:28.320
of understanding, whereas actually, I think the majority of those using critical realism

01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:34.640
are exploring it in relation to other social theories, in relation to other social ontologies,

01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:39.280
they're engaging at those boundaries and building those bridges. And I think that's where the really

01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:46.480
interesting work is being done. So yes, that would be some thoughts on that question. And I just

01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:51.760
want to very briefly say something that a few times in the chat, people have been talking about

01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:56.880
abduction and retroduction. If those words are confusing you, we will come back to those in

01:15:56.880 --> 01:16:03.040
future sessions. I'm sure that'll be picked up in the methodology, perhaps the epistemology

01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:07.120
session and perhaps others as well. So we shall come back to those issues.

01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:16.160
Yeah. And you know, I think social science is contested and that's the beauty of it.

01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:21.520
And that's the richness as well. And I think the religion example is brilliant because I'm

01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:28.560
myself an agnostic as well. And when I started to read about it, I really was puzzled with it.

01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:37.360
And I was saying, you know, it stopped me in the sense of it made me read with more care.

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:43.440
And it made me read more to say, okay, let me see if this is really aligned with my ontology of the

01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:53.760
world. But I think it's our position that we need to be able to defend it in our, if you're doing

01:16:53.760 --> 01:17:05.360
your PhD in your Viva. I, for example, in mine, had quite hard questions to answer. But I knew it

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:11.440
because I really didn't understand anything about it when I started. And I think that is the important

01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:16.560
thing. It doesn't matter if the people that are evaluating your thesis believe in it or not,

01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:22.320
I think what is important, if you have been so coherent that you are arguing your methodology,

01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:28.160
your explanation, your findings, the way in which you look at social change, non deterministic,

01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:32.960
all of that, if that is in line, you'll be able to defend it. And is it that you're doing a research

01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:37.040
project or your PhD, or you're doing something as a professional researcher, it doesn't matter,

01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:41.680
but you will be able to, you know, to make a sound case. I think that that is key.

01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:51.120
Excellent. I think we have answered the questions in the Q&A as far as I see it. But

01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:55.680
I'd be very keen for people to raise their hands if they want to come in with

01:17:55.680 --> 01:18:00.640
comments or other questions. We have eight minutes left. So if you do want to have other

01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:05.360
comments you'd like to make or questions you'd like to ask, please type them in or raise your hand

01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:10.480
and come in on the mic. It would be great to hear from some of you if there are any other

01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:14.800
thoughts. We'll just give a minute or two to see if anything else comes in before we wrap up.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:23.360
Yeah, Thanos, I think your comment is really to the point. So your supervisor said you're crazy

01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:31.120
and at the end it's a great thesis. I think it allows really to make, because it is really,

01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:34.880
you have to read to understand, you have to really go into it. It really allows it to

01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:41.440
make a sound work. I think it was my case as well. And maybe just one other thing on that is that

01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:48.080
it doesn't necessarily have to be the case that to use critical realism, you read everything that

01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:54.560
is written by critical realists and mobilise it all as some kind of gigantic structure.

01:18:54.560 --> 01:19:00.160
I think it's fine for you to be pulling out key ideas or key concepts that you find particularly

01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:05.600
useful. As long as you're paying attention to ensure that there aren't key contradictions between

01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:10.960
that and other parts of your theory, then it's okay to take parts from critical realism and

01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:15.760
include that in your research. I don't think we should be concerned about whether you're

01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:22.800
applying critical realism as a whole or not. And there our other sessions are going to be great.

01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:28.160
I think the last one talks about the framework and how you then are able to include in your

01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:35.040
scaffold structure these theories that make sense to your work. And there are people trying to build

01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:40.400
bridges between one thing and the other, Frederick van den Berger being one of them. So there is a

01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:46.960
lot of work going on in the social science and how can we communicate different maybe ways of

01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:51.040
looking at the world who's using critical realism and the strength it offers.

01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:58.160
Yeah, just another question or comment from Christopher about the relationship between

01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:04.640
Paulson and Tilly's realist evaluation and the kind of more bascarian critical realist tradition.

01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:09.600
So despite coming from the University of Leeds as both a Masters and PhD student,

01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:13.680
I'm not that familiar with Paulson and Tilly. I have read realist evaluation,

01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:20.720
but I'm not that familiar with their work or its influence. But I would say there's an interesting

01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:27.200
divide really that is that there's a kind of blurred boundary there. There is an International

01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:32.640
Association of Critical Realism Conference, and there is a realist evaluation conference.

01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:38.400
So on the face of it, they look separate, but actually you'll find people using both at different

01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:45.360
each conference, and you'll find people trying to overlap them in various ways.

01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:54.320
I think they're basically different frameworks for social analysis that broadly accept some of the

01:20:54.320 --> 01:21:01.040
same ontological positions would be a way of understanding it. Perhaps like I said,

01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:04.880
I don't have the knowledge to go into a huge amount of depth about the precise differences

01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:10.960
between them. But just as a more general comment is that Paulson and Tilly's realist evaluation

01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:20.800
tends to be more widely and easily applied to policy and to more empirical research, and Bascar's

01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:29.280
work tends to be more theoretically elaborate or in-depth, but is more a challenge to apply,

01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:34.000
as some of you probably discovered. But hopefully the rest of the sessions in the series will

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:38.960
make that a little easier. Yeah, and that realist evaluation, I think what it really does, it

01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:46.560
it uses these kind of concepts of generative mechanisms, the outcomes, and the context. I

01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:52.240
think it does really use that, but then they use it in the way that is useful for them.

01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:58.080
But I think they're, again, I don't know a lot, but I read two papers when I was trying to put

01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:04.640
these causal pathways together from my own work, and it was illustrative in the sense of how do

01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:12.640
you make your causal pathways? If you're explaining something, where are these mechanisms

01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:19.040
really interacting and producing the outcome that I can see? It is helpful, but yeah, we don't need

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:27.280
to take things like lots of activity going in the chat, which is great.

01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:36.000
Just to say that there's been one of the questions about when the realist evaluation

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:40.800
conference is. I don't know, but here's a website that should take you to the

01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:46.640
details of the last conference, and hopefully through there you'll be able to find information

01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:47.600
about the next one.

01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:57.840
Yeah, and thank you for sharing your resources, which are quite useful as well,

01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:02.800
so thank you for that. It enriches the space.

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:12.000
So I think without any further questions, I think we can draw the session to a close here.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:16.800
I just want to say a huge thank you to everyone who's asked questions and contributed in the

01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:21.840
chat. There's been absolutely loads going on there and loads of great exchanges of ideas,

01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:28.240
and thank you all for attending. Make sure you come along to the next session on epistemology

01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:33.680
and to follow the whole course through to the end, and we'd really appreciate your feedback

01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:39.680
as well, so please drop us an email or get in touch with feedback and use the forums that

01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:45.360
are on the Critical Realist Network website to ask questions and take the discussion forward as well.

01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:52.400
Yes, thank you very much. It was a pleasure, and it's always so much that one learns being

01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:56.400
in these spaces, so I'm grateful for your being here.
