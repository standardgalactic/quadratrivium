1. **Critical Realism Application**: It's perfectly fine to cherry-pick concepts from critical realism that are most relevant to your research, as long as you are aware of the theory as a whole and do not introduce contradictions within your work.

2. **Theory Integration**: In future sessions, you will learn how to integrate various theories into your research framework. Frederick van den Berger's work is an example of bridging different ways of looking at the world, which can be helpful in understanding and applying critical realism.

3. **Paulson and Tilly vs. Bascar**: There's a relationship between Paulson and Tilly's realist evaluation and Bascar's critical realist tradition. They share some ontological positions but differ in application and complexity. Realist evaluation is more empirically focused and easier to apply, while Bascar's work is more theoretically complex but presents a challenge to apply.

4. **Realist Evaluation**: This approach uses concepts like generative mechanisms, outcomes, and context to understand causality, which can be useful for explaining phenomena in your own research.

5. **Conference Information**: A participant inquired about the realist evaluation conference, and a resource was shared with details from the last conference, which should help attendees find information on upcoming events.

6. **Feedback and Engagement**: The session concludes with a thank you to all participants for their contributions and questions, both verbally and in the chat. Attendees are encouraged to continue the discussion, provide feedback, and participate in future sessions, including one focused on epistemology.

7. **Resource Sharing**: Participants are reminded to utilize the resources shared, including the Critical Realist Network website forums and additional information, to enhance learning and engagement with the course material.

8. **Closing**: The session ends with appreciation for the active participation and the collective learning experience, emphasizing the value of these interactive educational spaces.
