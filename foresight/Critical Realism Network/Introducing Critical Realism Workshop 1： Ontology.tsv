0	7440	Okay, brilliant. Shall we make a start then? I think most people have joined now, so welcome
7440	15360	everybody to the first session of the Introduction to Critical Realism webinars. Today we're talking
15360	21760	about ontology and this is the first of six and the following sessions will engage with epistemology,
21760	27680	methodology, approaches to analysis, key concepts and critical realism as a framework. So
27680	38000	yeah, make sure you do join the other sessions as well. So just a few very brief bits of housekeeping.
38800	45680	So firstly, please use the Q&A tool during the webinar. So if you have any immediate technical
45680	51680	issues or want to make a comment, use the chat box. But any questions that you have for us,
51680	57120	please put them in the Q&A section. And if you do that throughout the session, we'll try and pick
57120	61760	those up and make sure that we're answering all the questions. You can also comment on questions
61760	67920	in there and vote the ones that you really want to hear answered. Okay, so I think it'll be good
67920	73920	to start with some introductions. So I'll introduce myself. First of all, I'm Jack Newman from the
73920	80960	University of Surrey. My broader research interests are around British politics, social security policy,
81040	87680	local government. Although my interest in critical realism goes back about eight or
87680	93040	nine years to when I was doing my master's degree. And coming from a political science
93040	100640	background, I came across critical realism through the structure agency debate and trying to find a
100640	108480	suitable argument or solution to this problem of structure and agency. So that's my background
108480	112880	and how I came to critical realism. Caroline, do you want to introduce yourself too?
112880	118880	Yes. So I'm Caroline Coon, and I work at the University of Paspar as a lecturer there in the
118880	126480	School of Education. And I'm very interested in the combination of, I would say, technology,
126480	133120	education from a sociological perspective, I would say. And so I came to critical realism in a
133920	141600	later stage in my PhD where I, when I started to make sense of the data, I just couldn't
141600	146480	with what I had at hand. It wasn't possible for me. And I was really kind of struggling. And I
146480	152080	realized I need something to help me hear some theoretical kind of. And so I came across in a
152080	157920	conversation with someone at the University of Cape Town that they were using critical realism in
158000	165120	when they were exploring open educational resources. And once I started to read and read and read,
165120	171040	it was quite difficult at the very beginning. But I realized that was really what I needed to
171040	175840	make sense of what I was seeing in the data, particularly things that weren't there present,
175840	182240	that weren't, that they weren't showing, but that they were there. And yeah, so I started
182240	187280	to study it by myself because my supervisor didn't know anything about it, but he trusted me.
187280	195120	So I did a long journey into critical realism. And I think it is incredibly worth while our time.
195120	201920	And so that's how I came into it. Yes, that's me. Brilliant. I'll just say a couple more things,
201920	208080	and then we'll hopefully get some introductions from you guys, the audience. And so yeah, just to
208080	213120	be clear, if you have any technical issues or want to make comments or introduce yourselves,
213120	218480	please use the chat function. If you have any questions, please use the Q&A button,
219680	225680	or you can raise your hand as well during the discussion section. So here's how today's going
225680	233760	to run. We've got three parts to the webinar. Part one, we'll ask what is ontology. I know that this,
234400	239520	many of you will know what ontology is, but we're trying to make sure we kind of keep everyone
239520	246000	with us. And it's worth going back to, I think, for those who do not know already. And then we'll
246000	251760	talk about what a critical realist approach to ontology is. And then we'll conclude in the third
251760	256960	part by looking at the implications of a critical realist ontology. And hopefully we'll be taking
256960	262160	questions throughout and we'll have some discussion and we'll leave some extra time for discussion
262160	269440	at the end. And we're due to finish in about an hour and a half time. Okay, yeah, I'll hand back to
269440	275600	Caroline. Yeah, I was just wanting to ask the audience if anyone is keen to just introduce
275600	283440	themselves, what you do, do you study, do you work, and in a way, what brought you into critical
283440	290800	realism. We're a lot of people, it means we can't, not everyone can take the mic, but it would be
290800	296320	lovely to hear from some of you, so that we have an idea of who is in the room and the rest can
296320	300800	write it in the chat, which I see is already happening. There are lots of introductions
300800	309120	in the chat. So anyone who would like to take the mic, that would be great. Yeah, that is what we
309120	322160	would like to happen. Chris Roberts here. I'm relatively new to the field. I mean, years ago,
322800	327680	when I probably do my masters and I was sort of this thing called the internet had just been
327680	335360	discovered and I was, my supervisor was very much into sort of delusional guitaries, sort of bodies
335360	341920	without organs, and I found that a bit kind of radical. So I kind of moved from that more to
341920	347600	sort of constructivist view. My field is education, particularly health professional education,
347600	356000	but very, so it felt quite limited by what constructivist approaches to educational,
356000	361520	particularly transformational settings, you know, you know, trying to get sort of systemic
361520	369520	change in the health professionals education sector. But you know, the lack of sort of,
370400	376880	you know, sort of theories or sort of big models. And I guess then through a colleague or sort of
376880	384640	introduced to critical realism, it seemed to be a sort of really fit, good fit. It seemed to be
384640	391680	not rejecting some of the sort of the positivistic, post-positivist sort of positions, but critical
391680	398320	of them and seeing them in a very different way. And yet not seeing everything as sort of socially
398320	405760	constructed. There are noble things out there, but we just got fallible knowledge. So it just kind
405760	410720	of fitted for me. And I guess the work that I've been doing at the moment with colleagues
411600	418800	is more at that kind of the first, you know, the first sort of possibility of naturalism
418800	425280	kind of approach with this stratified ontology. I was thinking I was got some more to the, you
425280	430240	know, meta reality was just getting further and further away from a comfort zone. Although the
430240	438800	recent IACR, Frederick van der Berg was talking about, you know, how can you not want that project
438880	445440	of emancipation, a kind of sort of utopia in the air? And so shouldn't we consider the whole body
446080	455600	together? Thank you, Chris. That's great. And I would say, I mean, Deleuze and Guattari is so
455600	461280	different than critical realism. So it's just really fascinating how, you know, how theory
461280	466800	really in philosophy illuminates from different standpoints and different people from very
466800	469680	different angles. So great. And thank you, Chris. Anyone else?
475920	482800	Well, I see a lot of activity in the chat. So great. Shall we then, Jack?
483600	487600	David has his hand up. Yeah, thank you. I didn't see it.
488080	498960	David, go ahead. Oh, is that was that for me? Yeah. Yeah, so I'm David Palmer. I'm an anthropologist
498960	506640	at the University of Hong Kong. And I do a lot of work in relation to the anthropology of religion
506640	517760	in China and Asia. And I also, my work also goes into the sociology of religion. And I know
517760	523360	Phil Gorski, and he's been kind of promoting critical realism for the past many years. And I'm
523360	528800	actually, in a sense, from a postcolonial perspective, I'm quite interested in looking at how can we
528800	535040	seriously take different ontologies seriously? And what are the ontological foundations of
535040	542400	sociological theory and sociological methodology? So I'm, I'm, I think it's extremely important to
542400	553200	really have a deep awareness and critical thinking about the ontological assumptions of our own
553200	559040	discipline and the implications of that. And now moving directly into a project that I'm working
559040	563760	on now, I'm actually working on a book and a course, actually, that I'm going to be teaching
563760	570720	just in a couple of hours on science and religion, which I'm co teaching with an experimental physicist
571600	579600	who is a Christian. So we, we take, and I take more the Asian, like Taoist kind of perspective. So
580160	588880	we're really in trying to construct a framework for rethinking and reframing the relationship
588880	592800	between science and religion. We've come across a lot of concepts that are very,
593840	598480	that are very seem to resonate a lot with critical realism. So I would like to really
599840	602400	get a more systematic understanding of this approach.
605280	610720	Thank you, David. That's, that's great. Thank you. So interesting. Yes, Jack was saying so many,
610720	616160	you know, so different points of view and different needs as well. I think that is fascinating. Thank
616240	625040	you so much. I can't see hands up or anything. And, and also conscious of the time I shall,
625920	630480	we shall start our presentation. And, and, you know, we're welcoming the chat because we read it
630480	637840	then afterwards. And yeah, thank you so much. I'm reading here. Hasuki, Keinde, so interesting.
637840	643920	Thank you. Shall we start then, Jack? I am so Jack will go with the first part about what is ontology
643920	652160	in general terms. And I'll follow them. What is the critical realist understanding of this concept
652160	658880	of ontology? And then some practical and physical philosophical implications. Brilliant. Thanks,
658880	665360	Caroline. Yes. So let's get started with the question of what is ontology? And I'm sure some
665360	670640	of you have an idea. Some of you might think you have a good idea. And so let's just go through
670640	678640	the basics of what this, what ontology means. And I want to start out with this definition that you
678640	685360	always see in the textbooks here. So ontology is the philosophy of being an existence. Now,
685360	690720	I remember reading this in the textbooks back when I was a master's student and not really having a
690720	696400	clue what this meant. I think quite often it's a useful definition if you already know about ontology
696400	702560	but not very good as an introduction. So I just want to unpack this a little bit. So when we talk
702560	709360	about philosophy in this sense, what are we thinking about? So we're thinking about assumptions.
709360	715040	That's it. That is beliefs that people hold. They might not even realize they hold these beliefs.
716000	722560	We're talking about controversies. So areas of disagreement or debate. And we're talking about
722560	727840	theories. So systems of thought. They might be approaches to social science or they might be
727840	736240	religions perhaps. So ontology is a set of assumptions, controversies and theories.
736960	742720	What are they about? Moving to the right hand side of the slide there, we're thinking about being and
742720	749360	existence. So what do we mean by being an existence in this context? So when we're thinking about being,
749360	756080	we could think about the essence, experience or state of consciousness of living things.
756080	763040	What it is to be a person in the world or perhaps what it is to be an animal or non-person in the
763040	770960	world. And then much more broadly than this and perhaps more importantly, to ontology is also
770960	777600	about existence in general. Everything that is in some way real beyond our perception of it.
777600	782960	So yes, it's about our experience in the world. It's also about how the world actually is
784000	790160	outside of our experience. So yeah, when we're talking about ontology, we're thinking about
790160	796880	the assumptions, controversies and theories that are about reality in general, I suppose.
798400	802560	Okay, so I want to introduce a couple of skeptical challenges just to get us start
802560	808960	thinking about ontology. I pulled out a couple of quotes from Descartes here who is kind of
808960	818880	one of the key philosophers of modern Western philosophy. And he argues in his or writes in
818880	825360	his meditations, there is the fact that I'm sitting here seated by the fire, attired in a dressing
825360	830480	gown. So that's what that's where he was when he was writing his meditations. But and here's where
830480	835680	the challenge comes in. How often has it happened to me that in the night I dreamt that I found
835680	841920	myself in this particular place, that I was dressed and seated near the fire whilst in reality,
841920	848960	I was lying undressed in bed. So Descartes raises the problem of how we know that we're awake and
848960	854960	not dreaming. And if you go to menti.com there and enter the code, some of you have done so already,
854960	860000	if so go on to the next slide. And it'd be great if you could answer the poll that's on there just
860080	865200	to have a think about this. Yes, and I'm here waiting for your answers to just see what you
865200	870080	think if you're dreaming or if you're not dreaming, or if you're if you're not sure about what's
870080	878560	happening. Because the interesting thing here is to kind of challenge our thinking about whether
878560	885680	our day to day perception of reality is really giving us a true window or a true insight into how
885680	895120	the world really is around us. I'll just give you a moment to have a think about that one. Yes, I'm
895120	902320	here. Sorry, Jack, what was the particular question again? So if you go to menti.com there and enter
902320	907520	that code, it should give you a question for you to answer. The current question is,
907840	918880	are you 100% sure you're not dreaming right now? So I have six people that are not dreaming, seven,
918880	924880	eight. And then I have two people that are not really sure. And two people that are dreaming. So
924880	932640	we have 12 now that are not dreaming. And we're still have two that not three now that they are
932640	943920	dreaming. Yes, 13, that 14 that are not dreaming, three that are not sure. So I think the tendency
944720	953840	is to think that you're not dreaming. Okay, so you guys have a fairly, a fair amount of certainty
953840	958640	that your perceptions are giving you a true indication of reality perhaps. Yes, 15.
958640	966720	Wow. Okay, let's take another similar question then, just to get us to think about this question
966720	971920	of our immediate perception of the world around us. So I don't know whether anyone's seen the film
971920	978080	The Matrix. I recommend it, if not, it's a good film. But I just want to introduce a premise here.
978800	987600	In the top picture there, this chap, Neo, is living in the world day to day,
987600	994640	and he gets met by this person, Morpheus, who explains to him that actually he's not living
994640	999520	in the world. He's really laid in one of these tanks that you can see in the bottom picture.
999520	1005520	And a simulation of reality is being pumped into his mind. So that's the kind of premise of the
1005520	1012480	film there. So Morpheus says, Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that seems you seem so sure it was real?
1012480	1016960	If we're unable to wake up from that dream, how would you tell the difference between the dream
1016960	1022720	world and the real world? Now, I'm not trying to, again, you can go to Mentimeter and answer the
1022720	1027360	question there. I'm not trying to convince you that we're all living in a simulation far from it.
1027360	1033680	I'm just trying to open the prospect that our day to day perceptions don't give us a kind of clear
1034720	1041120	picture on what reality is really like. And reality may be other than our perception of it
1041120	1046560	on a day to day basis. And Chris is saying in the chat, I'm not dreaming that I cannot
1046560	1054640	connect to the Mentimeter pool. Sorry, Chris. Yeah, it not always works. I have it in front of me.
1054640	1059680	It is active. And I'm sorry if it doesn't work. It's just that sometimes happens.
1060720	1067680	But I like your answer. It's a good answer. I also quite like Mauricio's answer that in his,
1067680	1070960	in dreams, I don't pay bills. And that's how I know. Yeah.
1071920	1081120	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I'm here. I'm keen to see if it's possible to live. One is saying I'm
1081120	1086880	no, it's not possible to live in a simulation. And another one says yes, it is. And then we have
1086880	1092880	two people, but three people that don't think four, that we were living in a five, that we're
1092880	1101040	living in a simulation, five people and six people. And then we have three that that yes,
1101040	1107600	we can live in a simulation. So it's eight, nine and three. So nine or more. No, we can't.
1110560	1119680	And three that yes. And then 10, no. So yeah, 11, 12. It's a tendency again here, isn't it? But
1120560	1126480	yeah, that people don't think it's possible that we're living in a simulation 13 and three has
1126480	1132960	stayed stable in the yes answer. So yeah, it's, it's interesting really to just think about this,
1132960	1141040	I would say, for say yes. Yeah. A lot more, a lot more certainty in this group than yesterday's group.
1141040	1144720	Yesterday's group were all very skeptical and worried that they were dreaming and worried
1144720	1151040	that they might be living in a simulation. You guys are a lot more sure of your place in reality.
1151600	1157280	Okay, so thanks for taking part in that. I think it's useful to start thinking about these
1157280	1163680	ontological questions, but I just want to distinguish between two sets of questions here,
1163680	1170000	between ontology on the one hand and epistemology on the other hand. Epistemologies will be covered
1170000	1175600	in next week's session, actually. So when we're thinking about ontology in relation to many of
1175600	1180720	the issues we've just been discussing, we're thinking about questions, is there a reality
1180720	1186960	beyond our experience of the world? And then what is the nature of that reality? Is it, for example,
1186960	1192880	a simulation or not could be one such question? And what is the difference between reality and
1192880	1198000	experience anyway? Even is there a difference? Whereas epistemology is very much more looking
1198000	1202080	at questions of knowledge. What counts as knowledge? How is it that we can come to know
1202080	1207040	anything? And can we be certain of anything? And what do we mean by truth? These are questions
1207040	1212240	of epistemology that will be tackled next week. Now, some approaches kind of reject the distinction
1212240	1218640	between these or try and blur the distinction. Critical realism tries to look at the two
1218640	1226800	separately. And this week we'll be focusing on ontology. So I've got one more problem or question
1226800	1234720	for you, which is about friendship, the idea of friendship. Now, do you think that friendship
1234720	1241680	is just a way of describing the thoughts and actions of two individuals? Or is a friendship
1241680	1248080	between, excuse me, two people also a real thing in its own right? So just to rephrase that I'll
1248080	1255520	say it again, is friendship just a word we use, just as shorthand to describe what two individual
1255520	1262960	people are doing? Or do you think that friendship is a real thing in the world? Is it some object or
1262960	1269280	real thing? So I'd be very interested to hear your thoughts about this. Either put your responses
1269280	1276080	in the chat box or raise your hand perhaps and we can get one or two people responding on the
1276080	1281360	microphone. So yeah, do share some thoughts on this. While we wait here, I just wanted to take
1281360	1286480	something that I find quite interesting in the chat. Those critical realism offer the red pill,
1286480	1293520	so we can see what is really happening behind the simulation. And I just, why do I pick this?
1293520	1299120	Because this is an interesting question that you will be kind of fleshing out throughout the six
1299120	1307360	sessions. And I think today maybe it points to that. I don't have the answer, but it's interesting.
1307360	1314160	And I hope that you can find some pointers, I think, in these six sessions.
1315920	1322080	Yeah, so here we have it's ideationally real. I think friendship is real, but it is bound in time.
1322800	1329680	Friendship is not an object, but it's real. So it's an entity. Yes, okay. Or the effect of friendship
1329680	1337040	are real. Yeah, there we have the effects. Friendship is like wetting your pants. Everyone can see it,
1337040	1344960	but only you know it's real warmth. That's a good way of describing it. I think friendship is real
1344960	1352160	and has many layers. Yes, social, cultural, and personal layers. Yes, it's about the layers. That's
1352160	1357200	a good point. It appears and disappears. But when it's there, it's certainly there.
1358000	1367920	Yeah, great. Thank you. So many answers. Yeah, quite a lot of people who are giving critical
1367920	1374800	realist answers as well. And I just want to clarify what that means just with one final
1374800	1383120	slide here. From a critical realist perspective, how do we know something is real? So a kind of
1383120	1391280	traditional criteria that Baskar points out is the perceptual criteria for reality. So if the
1391280	1397360	phenomenon, say friendship, can be perceived, then it is real. But Baskar argues that that's not enough.
1398240	1404000	That's not enough to decide whether something is real or not, because there are some things we
1404000	1409600	perhaps can't perceive, but still want to insist they're real. So there's also the causal criteria
1409600	1414880	for reality. And I think some people were getting at this in the chat box. For something to be real,
1414880	1421360	it needs to be causally efficacious. That means it needs to be able to cause an effect in the
1421360	1428480	world. It needs to create an outcome. So it may not be a cause that is triggered. So it may not
1428480	1433040	be a cause that actually has an outcome, but it could be a cause that has the potential to have
1433040	1438800	an outcome. So this causal criteria for reality is one we could apply for friendship. As somebody
1438800	1445200	said there in the chat box, so a friendship has effects in the world. And this could be the basis
1445920	1452160	of which we argue that is real. Okay, that's me done for this section on what is ontology.
1452160	1457920	I'll just give you guys a moment to ask some questions if you want, using the Q&A feature,
1457920	1462960	or to raise your hand and come in on the microphone. If you have any questions or want to
1462960	1468880	share any thoughts at this point, and then in a moment we'll start the next session, the next section.
1473120	1474240	Any questions?
1484560	1489120	There's one hand up from Mauricio. Okay, yeah, Mauricio.
1490080	1496240	Hi, I think one interesting question would be who cares or why care about
1497840	1503280	the reality of reality from a critical realist perspective. Thank you.
1503840	1508800	Okay, do you have any thoughts on that before we answer?
1510320	1517760	Yes, I come from Sociologists of Discipline, so to me the fact that something is real is in that
1517760	1525760	critical realist viewpoint means that it is in a way oppressive. It's something that happens,
1525760	1531840	whether you want it or not, like paying bills. And therefore, it is important because
1534320	1538480	things that are real are the things that can be analyzed, can be described, and so on.
1539360	1544240	And I think it is important to distinguish between what is real and what is not,
1544960	1555360	and in order to give enough, I think credence, but also weight, but also analytical importance
1555360	1561040	to things that are real beyond the objectively perceptive and so on. So for me that's,
1562320	1568240	I study how a constitution was made, so to me looking at that mechanism is important because
1568240	1572320	it's a real mechanism that has real effects on the social structure, for example.
1572560	1579680	Okay, brilliant. Yeah, I think you've answered the question very well. I'll just add one other
1579680	1585680	thought which is thinking about a kind of discipline, a social science discipline,
1585680	1590880	and going about establishing the theories and deciding what to research there. And I think
1590880	1597040	when we're working out what isn't real, it's very important for deciding what the main concepts
1597040	1601760	are going to be for the discipline. What are we going to investigate? What aspects of the world
1601840	1610080	are we going to ask about or focus on? So I think that would be another aspect that builds on your
1610080	1615920	thoughts there. Okay, brilliant. Caroline, any other thoughts or any other questions?
1615920	1621520	Yeah, there are two things here. I want to say that one of the things that critical realism
1621520	1627120	really advocates for is emancipation. And to be honest, I think what it really
1627680	1634240	offers us is a theory of social change. I mean, I'm simplifying this. Not only it's a philosophy
1634240	1645200	of science, but I think it is really geared to be able to intervene in the cogs of the machinery
1645200	1651920	of society. And I think, yes, it is important to ask the question, who cares and why should we care?
1651920	1658400	And there is where critical realism offers us tools and ways of thinking that we can then
1659200	1665920	enact some change. Yeah, there is an interesting question here about friendship and structures.
1665920	1671680	If it is a structure, although it's only between two people, I mean, can we say friendship is a
1671680	1676880	social structure even only between two people? And that's an interesting question. Jack, I'm not sure
1676880	1685520	if you have any thoughts around this. Is this really very nuanced things that makes us be confused
1685520	1691120	at moments? Is it a structure because it's only between two people? Is one individual a structure?
1691120	1697440	How is that? I think there are very differing, or my review is that there are very differing
1697440	1701360	understandings of the word structure in the literature. So you always have to be careful
1701360	1708960	when you're reading the word in a sociologist or even a critical realist. So I think Popora,
1708960	1713600	who someone mentioned earlier, gives one of the best critical realist understandings of
1713600	1720800	social structure. And he talks about relational structures between social positions in society.
1720800	1725120	Tony Lawson is another one that gives a good understanding of structure here. So I would
1725120	1732080	say that a friendship is part of the social structure, is part of relational social structures.
1732080	1737840	Whether we say it's a structure in itself, I don't know, I think that depends on how you're
1737840	1743440	using the word really. But I would certainly say that friendships are part of the social structure,
1743440	1748800	relations between people, positioned people. And I think it will also, when you do your
1748800	1754640	research, and if you are researching friendship in particular, you will then be reading different
1754640	1759840	definitions and you will see what suits your investigation as well. So I think that that
1759840	1767840	is something that is important. So yeah, it's fascinating so many. There are other questions
1767840	1774240	in the chat. There is one which I think might be interesting about the difference between ontology
1774240	1783280	and metaphysics. I would say this is a broad question that it might take more time than what
1783280	1790800	we have to clarify. If there is any, I don't know, short answer there, Jack, I'm not sure. I think
1790800	1798640	it's a really broad and deep question. Yeah, and maybe just one quick thought on the difference
1798640	1804640	there would be that ontology tends to be concerned with the category, categories of things that are
1804640	1810240	real. So what are the parts of the world that we define as real? And how do we kind of organize
1810240	1817920	those categories? Whereas metaphysics as a whole tends to be thought of as a larger concern
1817920	1823600	that includes those kind of skeptical questions I was asking at the start and is a broader question
1823600	1829920	about the underlying natures and structures of the universe. Although there are clearly overlaps
1829920	1834320	between the two, significant overlaps between the two, that's one way of thinking about the
1834320	1842080	difference, perhaps. Yeah, okay, so I believe, and again, aware of the time and conscious of the
1842080	1849600	time that we will continue with our second part, which will be more focused on the critical
1849600	1859680	realist ontology and what is it in critical realism? That is defining of realities of what is real.
1859680	1866320	And so if you go to the next slide, please, Jack. Yeah, so to begin with, we have always these two
1866320	1872720	worlds, the natural world and the social world. And Baskar already in his critical naturalism
1872720	1880880	says that these two worlds are not apart and he didn't want to make kind of a sharp difference.
1880880	1886880	Nevertheless, he said, we can't reduce one to the other in so far that is critical. So the
1886880	1894960	social world can't be reduced to the natural world. And it has its properties and it is, we have to
1894960	1903840	study it as something that really emerges as part of the natural world. And so one of the things I
1903840	1910320	think here that I, you can see underneath this pictures is that you in the natural world would
1910320	1916320	do experimentation. So you have a closure really, your experiment is like a closure of that natural
1916320	1923200	world. And then you want to predict and then find these causal laws, whereas in the social world,
1923200	1929280	you would be exploring. And you can't do any closure because it is an open system. And we're
1929280	1935360	going to go into into that open system definition in the next slide. And but what you can do really
1935360	1941280	is explain, but you can't predict. I think this is one of the key things in critical realism.
1941920	1947760	And if we go to the next slide, Jack, please. So here, I would say, are these kind of three
1948960	1960240	main tenants of how social reality is defined in critical realism. And it's really stratified,
1960240	1965760	it's deep, so we don't have a flat ontology, which is only what we can see. It's an open and
1965760	1971280	complex system. So stratified. And we're going to I'm going to explain these three things in detail,
1971280	1977760	but just stratified means that we have levels of reality. An open system means that this social
1977760	1984160	world is really multi determined. So we have multiple causalities. And we don't know accurately
1985200	1992720	these causes, which counter the other, which reinforce others, which cancel others. So it's
1992720	1997280	really this kind of very multi determined space. And that's why it's an open system.
1998480	2007280	And emergence is the property that emerges from systems that are complex. And so in I would say,
2007280	2014320	and please, this is a simplification. Yeah, there is a lot of explanation deeper. And so that's
2014320	2020240	the reading that you do. But this is just kind of to pinpoint main things. So you can't really
2020240	2024960	rely on on empirical data, if you want to answer your research question from a critical
2024960	2031920	realist perspective, because the world is much more than than what we can see, perceive, and you
2031920	2042640	know, what catches the eye. And the next one, Jack, please. And here this, this metaphor of the iceberg,
2042640	2048080	I think, not me, many think that it's a very good metaphor to explain this stratified or
2048080	2053680	stratification of reality. And although I'm going to start from the bottom up, because I think
2054720	2060800	in the in this kind of the iceberg really tells us that if an iceberg is to stand there for million
2060800	2067920	and millions of years, it's because it has a strong mass underneath the water, and it gives
2067920	2072560	its solidity. And I think that's a really good thing to think about when we are investigating
2073520	2079040	social reality under a critical realist perspective. So these generative mechanisms,
2079040	2085520	which are those that make things happen in the world, they live underneath of what we can see,
2085520	2091280	they're really invisible, most of the times, at first sight, I mean, here. Then what happens is
2091280	2096560	that these generative mechanisms interact with each other and then events happen. But these
2096560	2101920	events not necessarily can be observed all the time. So they live also underneath the water,
2101920	2107440	but they happen, although we can't see them when these generative mechanisms interact with each
2107440	2114000	other. And then what happens is at the empirical level are these events that we really can observe.
2114000	2120880	But this is only just the 10% of that reality that we're investigating. So again, I think the main
2120880	2129040	takeaway here is don't trust what you can see and just go deeper. Yeah, the next one, please.
2129840	2135200	And so this is really, again, just kind of putting together these ideas of we start with
2135200	2140640	the empirical level, because yes, it's what we can see. It's what we talk with our participants,
2140640	2146160	is what we find out about the reality we are interested in. But this only opens the door
2146720	2152480	through then using theory that allows you then to go to this deeper level where the structures
2152480	2159200	and this generative power or mechanism are, I would say, hidden most of the times. And that's
2159200	2164880	why emancipation, I think for me at least, is something that we really thrive for when we
2164880	2169760	use critical realism. What is that invisible thing that is, and someone said oppressive,
2169760	2175120	yes, these structures normally are oppressive. So how can we really see them? The next one, please,
2175120	2185280	Jack. And the open system that I was mentioning before is, I think I don't have to explain that
2185280	2192640	much, but what it really means is that the social world is a causal network of interacting forces
2192640	2200320	that counteract each other, reinforce each other, cancel sometimes. So it's very difficult to really
2200320	2208720	say something in a predictive manner. So if A is here, B will happen. It's not necessarily the case.
2208720	2214400	And so you can't really make any closure. You have to be always aware that you can only say
2214400	2221840	so much about social reality. The next one, please, Jack. And what this really brings us to think about
2221840	2227600	that we are not working with causal laws. We're really doing multiple causality. That's what
2227600	2232880	we're looking for. Are there multiple causes that are responsible for the event that we are
2232880	2238720	investigating? And human beings are themselves open systems. And I was thinking about this when
2238720	2245440	you asked about the question of structure and friendship. So we are open systems and we're
2245440	2252160	capable of communication, creativity and resistance. This means that there is always the
2252160	2258320	possibility of something new happening. And this, I think, is an evidence that we really can't predict
2258320	2262320	because there is always something new happening. There is always some creation that we have not
2262320	2268480	expected or that is not. We couldn't really predict for that. The next one, please, Jack.
2269600	2276800	And the phenomenon of emergence, I think, is quite interesting because it refers to the
2276800	2283360	properties that arise when different parts constitute a whole. And the flock of birds is
2283360	2290560	an example that I have used to illustrate this because I think it really makes the case of how,
2291440	2298080	when birds are together, things arise. So an emergent entity is constituted by the parts,
2298080	2305040	how they are arranged in relation to one another. And the unique properties, the whole holds
2305040	2310400	due to the arrangement of the parts. So what we can see here, I would say three important things,
2310400	2317840	the parts, the arrangement of these parts. How are they arranged? And then they form this whole
2317840	2325440	and what is this whole? And if we go to the next slide, there is a more precise explanation of this,
2325440	2331600	which is really, this is from National Geographic, a study about flock of birds. And what I want to
2331600	2338000	take from this example is that, so I'm going to read the left hand side. While it sounds like
2338000	2344960	waves spread best in bigger flocks, the waves transmitting information about direction spread
2344960	2352080	best in smaller flocks. So here we can see how the size of the flock matters for the effect
2352080	2357440	or the property that is going to emerge, namely how they change direction when they do their
2357440	2365680	emigration, or also sometimes when they arrive to a particular space. So smaller flocks tend to
2365680	2373520	have a more rigid behavior, if you wish, because the waves travel more quickly. So what I want to
2375120	2380320	stress here is that the way in which these birds are arranged, is there a big flock,
2380320	2386800	is it a small flock, really determines the effect of the transmission of the information
2386800	2391920	about the direction. And I think that is key, although this is in the natural world, but
2391920	2399200	Pascal said they're not different. They are in a way different, but they are as well together.
2399200	2406320	So the next slide, please. And the same thing happens here with fish, shawls, it is exactly the
2406320	2410400	same, how they behave together is completely different than what they do by themselves.
2411120	2421040	And the next one, please, Jack. What is really the aim of social science and OSAS researcher
2421680	2427360	is to discover these emergent properties. So the entities, the agents, the structure,
2427360	2431760	and their emergent generative power, this is really, or the mechanism, what social
2431760	2438960	science is about. All of this is within a critical realist perspective. And this in society,
2438960	2445760	if you go to the next slide, Jack, what it allows us really to see here, and I'm not going to read
2445760	2451120	all of that. I'm conscious about the time. I'm going to just go to the last bit. A context where
2451120	2457120	the resources are allocated unevenly will have different effects on the individuals that operate
2457120	2463680	within it. And here we see the whole is the society, how the parts, which in this case are the resources,
2463680	2469840	are allocated, how these are arranged in a society have effects and they have different
2469840	2474800	effects. If you think about Latin America, I'm going to talk about Venezuela, particularly my
2474800	2482320	experience to not generalize resources are incredibly unevenly allocated. Now, how society
2482320	2489520	lives there is incredibly different than if we think about Norway or England, although I know
2489520	2494480	things are changing, but nevertheless, the resources are allocated in a different way than
2494480	2500880	in Venezuela. And we see how society and its individuals have completely different effects
2500880	2505360	in how they live. And then that does as well as we are, you know, that then brings to different
2505360	2513840	and different consequences. And so I think with this, I think that if you go to the next slide,
2513840	2520640	I think this is the, yeah, that the so what I believe is important here is that we look at
2520640	2526640	these three things. So how can we go to these deeper layers of society or social reality, sorry,
2526640	2533440	how we should not stay in the empirical, how we always need to be conscious that what we are
2533440	2540400	investigating is an open system. And in every open system, it's we have this complexity when things
2540400	2549280	just come together. And in the coming together, and here is I think the social structures as
2549280	2556800	Tony Lawson defines is the this is really about the positions of these parts. So I think here,
2557520	2561680	yeah, those are the three things that we should kind of take into account when we investigate.
2561680	2566080	And these generative powers are really the object of analysis, what are they and what are they doing?
2566640	2573280	And I, yeah, if you have any questions, I think this is a good time to just break a bit
2574800	2579360	the talking. And any question, if someone would like to take the mic, I think there are some
2579360	2585680	questions. Yeah, so there's there's a few questions that have that I've dug out of the chat. So if you
2585680	2591680	do have questions, please pop them in the Q&A section, just make some a bit easier for us to
2591680	2595840	find an answer, especially when there's a few coming in at once. But just I want to go back to a
2595840	2604640	few that came out of the chat from from earlier on. And so we have one from Stephen, with the
2604640	2611360	that I think builds on the discussion of friendship, saying wouldn't this imply that ideas as real as
2611360	2619760	objects. And I think that's a really interesting question. And I would I would personally say
2619760	2625680	yes, I mean, it depends what you mean by as real as something, but just just to kind of just define
2625680	2632480	and back the answer up. And if you think about the human individual, and argue that the URIs
2632480	2638240	an individual person is real, then we could say that actually, we're just made up of smaller parts,
2638240	2642320	as Caroline has just been saying, and that those are real, and that those are made up of smaller
2642320	2648400	parts, and those are real. So unless we believe that there's some bottom layer of reality from
2648400	2654000	which that is the only thing that's real, if we want to claim that we as people and other
2654000	2660000	objects we see around us are real, and I think it makes just as much sense to say that ideas and
2660000	2665760	social structures that emerge from us are real objects. And one final thought on this building
2665760	2672880	on the causal criteria for reality is that critical realists talk about reasons being causes,
2672880	2677760	and the way that the reasons we do things, the justifications for things, the ideas we have
2677760	2684960	about things can be causes. So hopefully that answers the question, but do come back in the chat
2684960	2690800	or by raising a hand if you want to. Caroline, were there other questions? I have a couple more
2690800	2695760	here, but I don't know if you have any at your side. I'm just looking at the Q&A, but I think we'll
2695760	2701120	leave them to the end. Is that right? Okay, yeah. Daniel has a hand raised. Daniel, did you want to
2701120	2710560	come in? I just would be interested. I know that Pascal is making a difference between a transitive
2710560	2719200	and intransitive dimension. Would that not be an important concept to discuss friendship?
2720640	2724800	Okay, just want to elaborate on that a little bit just to clarify.
2724800	2731200	Sorry, I didn't understand. What do you mean? Yeah, could you just say a little bit more just
2731200	2738720	to be clear on why that you think that relates to friendship? Yeah, I'm just good to have it.
2740000	2749840	Okay, I'm not totally sure, but I would say that Pascal would say that in a friendship as I wrote
2749840	2758080	in the chat that there are different layers of friendship. And perhaps regarding a personal
2758080	2769520	friendship, I have with somebody that something that can change quite quickly. But the concept
2769520	2776800	of friendship, what we do think of friendship is something we have in our culture. And that's not
2776800	2784320	that easy to change our ideas. And I think if I understand Pascal right, he would even say that
2785760	2791280	behind the concept and our cultural ideas about friendship, there is something deeper
2791280	2800000	in reality and a lethic level where friendship is real and does not change. Would you agree?
2800400	2809120	Okay, yeah, no, I think I would agree. That's really interesting. So we have the transitive
2809120	2816880	dimension being the dimension of knowledge and knowing and the tools of understanding, so to
2816880	2822640	speak, the way in which we understand and explain the world and the intransitive being the world
2822640	2827760	itself, the thing we're studying and looking at. So I'm really just repeating your answer back to
2827760	2834160	you, Daniel, but just for clarity for some of those who are listening. And so when we're talking
2834160	2840080	about the transitive, we're thinking about how we see friendship as a society, perhaps how we see
2840080	2847200	friendship as sociologists, maybe, as well. But then there is something real going on as well
2847200	2853040	underneath there. There are causal mechanisms that mean that a friendship between two people can have
2853040	2859200	effects in the world. It's real regardless of whether other people acknowledge it or notice it
2859200	2865680	or study it or not. So I think that's the idea of the distinction there. And hopefully that's
2865680	2872320	answered the question. Please do come back if not. Caroline, is there anything else to pick up on?
2872320	2878560	No, well, I think that if it has effects, this is one thing where we then need to say, okay,
2878560	2884400	wait, let me go deeper here. Let me think about this. I think this is really the kind of first
2885200	2891520	thing where you say, okay, this has effects. And that's the criteria that we used in our last slide
2891520	2897440	to when something is real and when it's causally efficacious. So I think that is really something
2897440	2906640	to think about. But yeah, brilliant. Even Daniel was saying it, right? We've got quite a few of the
2906720	2911520	questions here. Shall we take these or should we take the next section and come back to them all at
2911520	2920720	the end? I suggest, yeah, we don't have that much to go. So we could take the next section and then
2920720	2925280	we start with our Q&A. And in our last half an hour, I would say that would be great.
2925280	2931120	Okay, that's a good idea. So we don't have, yeah, we only have a couple of slides left each. So we'll
2931120	2936320	say this and then we'll open a bit more space for others to come in and to answer some of these
2936320	2941440	other questions that are in the chat and Q&A. Brilliant. Okay, so thinking about the implications
2941440	2946400	of a critical realist ontology, I just want to quickly look at a few philosophical implications.
2946400	2952560	There are perhaps a lot more than I've summarised on this slide here, but just to raise a few.
2952560	2957760	So firstly, one implication is that there is a reality beyond our experience of it.
2958720	2963360	So I think that's, I suppose, might be obvious to some people, but is an important
2963920	2969600	point to make when we're conducting social science and to be aware of that there is a
2969600	2975120	reality beyond our experience. Perhaps more controversially, the implication of critical
2975120	2980240	realism is that there's a reality beyond actual events. So there are potential causes that could
2980240	2985760	have been triggered or could have happened that didn't. And we can think about these as being
2985760	2993120	part of the real, these causal mechanisms or causal properties of entities. And there's this
2993120	2998240	point that reality is not necessarily how it appears to us, which raises that problem about
2998240	3005280	whether we can be sure about the world around us and about reality, which gives us that fallibility
3006400	3010720	although we can generate knowledge on the basis of assumptions we find compelling,
3010720	3016800	we can't be 100% sure we might always be wrong. So, and then finally, I just want to go to these
3016800	3021360	bullet points at the bottom of the slide and highlight that when we're conducting research,
3022160	3029760	we need to consider both causality and meaning. So traditionally, positivists have focused on
3029760	3035200	causality and interpretivists have focused on understanding meaning. Critical realism calls
3035440	3042080	for us to do both to try and explain society and explain causality and to understand meaning as well.
3042080	3048720	We need to focus on both structures and agents, so both the social context in which people live
3048720	3054480	and their unique kind of creative powers as individual agents to make change in the world.
3055520	3060160	We need to understand relations between people, so those friendships we were talking about,
3060240	3064720	but maybe also those, or maybe even more importantly, those economic relationships
3064720	3072160	like landlord and tenant, for example, or employer and employee. But then we also need to understand
3072160	3078640	and think about relations between ideas and the way in which two ideas might contradict one another
3078640	3084800	and this might have causal consequences in the world. Archer talked a lot about this in her
3084800	3091760	theory on culture and uses examples from religion where contradictions arise in the Bible and that
3091760	3097920	has a causal impact on how society develops. And then finally, we need to think about both the
3097920	3106400	natural and social. So as Caroline has said, critical realism insists that we need a kind
3106400	3111440	of general philosophy for understanding both and although the social world is very different in
3111440	3117440	lots of ways, we need to be aware of both. And when we're studying society or our various
3117440	3124800	disciplines in social science, we need to be aware of our bodies and the physical world around us
3124800	3131120	as well as the kind of ideas and discussion and language and discourse, etc. Okay, so those are
3131120	3136240	just a quick run through some philosophical implications. I hand over to Caroline for more
3136240	3143280	practical implications. Yes. And thank you, Jack. I want to again insist that these implications,
3143920	3151200	particularly the practical ones, are going to be kind of unfolding along these seminars.
3151920	3156560	So I do encourage you to go to all of them because I'm just kind of, you know,
3156560	3165120	I'm even touching the tip of the iceberg because there are epistemological implications which
3165120	3173040	are going to be addressed in the second seminar. One thing that in my experience, I have experienced
3173040	3178960	myself, is very important, is the critical realism so that philosophy of science has an
3178960	3185200	immediate implication in my research design or in our research design. What is the methodology?
3185200	3190720	Which are the methods I'm going to use to collect which data? Is it enough? Does it
3190720	3198240	allow me to go deeper? Or does it open the door to then go deeper? And I think that is one of the
3198240	3207920	key things that, yeah, one needs to be aware if I'm using this, okay, what are the implications for
3207920	3213920	my methodology for my design of my investigation? And it's always important to ask, what is the
3213920	3219040	nature of the object that we're investigating? What is it made of? What are the constituent parts?
3219200	3227680	What are these? How are they? I think Jack was saying these kind of basic concepts, which are
3227680	3236000	they? I need to really be very aware that that is very, very important. And if you read, I think
3236000	3240800	someone made that comment in the chat at the beginning, the guide that Tom Fryer did, which is
3240800	3247120	really an amazing work, that also I think signals, at least for me, a deep understanding and that's
3247120	3252800	why he's able to do the comics of it, because it's a deep understanding that has been really put to
3252800	3258080	and brought to another level. So you don't go looking for something that doesn't exist. And so you
3258080	3264400	don't ignore the full reality of the world. And if you set up off with a bad theory of ontology,
3265520	3270880	you really are risking that you'll end up with a math project or, yeah, or just,
3271120	3279280	yeah, it can go really wrong, I have to say, if our ontology is not well determined and defined.
3279280	3286720	And if we have this kind of, yeah, this position that we are clear about. And I think in this seminar
3286720	3292320	of this morning, we have very experienced people with not only PhD students, but people that are
3293040	3301360	more experienced. Nevertheless, I would like to just make a comment. I arrived quite late to
3301360	3308240	critical realism. And I came also from a very practical space. I was a math teacher, which I'm
3308240	3313760	still, but I worked a lot in this kind of teaching environment with a more pragmatic approach to
3313760	3321920	what I was doing. And when I confronted myself with doing a PhD and thinking about ontology and
3321920	3329920	epistemology, I would say I think I didn't take it that seriously at the time, because I was ignorant
3329920	3338880	really. And I changed at a later stage, but I took a year to understand what is this ontology really
3338880	3347040	about. And once I have it clear, then I could do all the rest. And so I just want to say that,
3347040	3355200	yes, it is important to have a clear ontological stance and being aware of what are these implications.
3355840	3364000	And I think with this, we've come to an end. And we go to our Q&A. I think it's great with
3365600	3373760	our time. And we have some questions here in the Q&A. So, yeah, any questions, I think,
3373840	3378560	from this, or shall we just, and yeah, someone was asking about a reference, and I just said
3378560	3383920	they are here in these slides. And we're going to put the link to the slides in the critical
3383920	3394320	realist network site at the end of today. So, yeah, there's so much going on in the chat.
3397120	3402240	Sorry, I was just trying to find my unmute button there. Yeah, just before we go to the Q&A,
3402240	3407200	I think we've picked up everything in the chat. If you've asked questions in the chat,
3407200	3411840	and we've not touched on them, please pop them into the Q&A. We'll make sure we get to all those
3411840	3419040	there. I just want to pick up on one other that was asked by Christopher, which is whether
3419040	3428480	objects have agency. And this depends on how we use the word objects. And I just want to say that
3428480	3436960	you will find the word objects and objective used in so many different ways in the literature
3436960	3442160	about ontology and epistemology. So, be very wary when you see that word and try and read
3442160	3447600	around it to understand what the author is saying. In my own kind of understanding, I would say that
3447600	3455360	yes, objects can have agency because we are both objects and agents. Our body has a physical
3455360	3461920	existence in the world that makes it an object that can kind of knock against things or we can
3461920	3468400	walk into things, etc. But also it has an internal existence that is able to think and
3469680	3474400	has a kind of unique creative capacity in the world to observe and
3476320	3482720	to make change and to kind of accept or reject ideas, etc. So I would say that's one way in
3482720	3490560	which objects have agency. And then there's various kind of guess work about what other
3490560	3497120	objects have agency. We assume animals have agency to some extent as well and then I will
3497120	3501920	leave it up to your own imagination to see how much further you want to take that. Some people
3501920	3506880	might argue that society as a whole has some consciousness or agency. I'm not personally
3506880	3511920	convinced by that one, but that is a position that some people argue. And I suppose it's one of the
3511920	3518800	reasons that critical realism is often compatible with religious approaches, though I'm not myself
3518800	3524240	religious, other people within critical realism are. So that's quite a broad question. Answer to
3524240	3528480	your question, but hopefully that's helpful. Caroline, did you want to pick a question?
3528480	3534720	Yeah, I think a Hindi. I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing well the name, but I had a question that I
3534720	3541200	asked. And again, him or her, I'm not sure if the name, because I'm not familiar with it, but
3541200	3545760	if you can put that question in the Q&A, because it was a question about structure and agency,
3545760	3553200	which I think is quite important, it's about how can social structure be applied, contextualized
3553200	3559040	at individual levels or the micro level in relation to human agency. So you're specifically
3559040	3566240	talking about structure and agency relationships at the individual level. And yeah, I just wanted
3566240	3575520	to say, I think the work of Margaret Archer is illustrative for this. She, her work on
3575520	3582240	reflexivity and the inner conversation, she has two books about that, the one of, yeah, I think
3582240	3592880	it's 2017, if I'm not wrong. But so she offers, and her, as well, I think her morphogenetic cycle
3592880	3600000	really allows you to think about the agency and this kind of how your inner conversation
3602000	3607680	is something really important, because it's what mediates your agency. Now, I would suggest there
3607680	3615520	is another Paolo Donati, who has worked with her in the relational subject. And I think Donati has
3615520	3622240	a more social approach to reflexive engagement, what the inner conversation, there is a critique
3622240	3628880	that we don't talk only to ourselves, we talk with others. And the inner conversation is not,
3628880	3634320	it's not the only thing that mediates agency, there are other, other conversations, if you wish. So
3635120	3640560	I hope to answer that question, Kehinde, I think that will allow you to, to explore this, this
3640560	3645680	question deeper with Archer's work. Yeah. Thank you, Jack, for putting that reference there.
3647120	3651360	Can I just also say that I know there are a few people here who've read quite a lot of critical
3651440	3656960	realism. So I don't want this to be the case that Caroline and I, the experts and you guys are all
3656960	3662000	asking the questions. If you have any contributions to add to what we're saying, that would be great
3662000	3671680	too. So please raise a hand and jump into the, to the discussion. Okay, so shall we pick up
3671760	3682000	another question here. Question from Mateus, do the natural and social overlap,
3682000	3688640	some social structures maybe influenced by the natural? Yeah, absolutely. So I think one, one
3688640	3696240	way of thinking about this is in terms of emergence. So the idea that the social emerges from the
3696240	3701760	natural. And when we use that word emergence, we're not necessarily talking about over time
3701760	3708400	here. We're thinking in any particular moment, there is the natural world that includes our
3708400	3716640	bodies and human made objects, for example. But from that, that natural world of atoms and cells
3716640	3723920	and biology emerges the social world of agency and thought and then social structures and ideas,
3723920	3730080	etc. So that would be one way in which they overlap that one emerges from the other. But then
3730080	3735440	thinking introducing time into the equation and thinking about this over time, we can say that
3735440	3742960	of course they interact constantly on, you know, a second by second basis, the natural and the
3742960	3750320	social world interacting. And I think exploring the interaction between them is a really important
3750320	3755360	kind of approach to social analysis. So yeah, really good question. Thanks. Please come in
3756480	3758960	and raise your hand if you want to add anything to that.
3762080	3768720	Christopher, I'm not sure, Jack, if you, if you did answer this question, because I'm not that great
3768720	3773680	at multitasking and hearing and reading at the same time. But I think it's a, it's a, it's a
3773680	3779280	question that is interesting. Can we distinguish the stratified levels of actual empirical and real
3779280	3785600	in data? So for example, interview data, document analysis, when doing qualitative research about
3785600	3794800	a particular social phenomenon, phenomena. So do you have any, any particular answer to this,
3794800	3802960	Jack, first to begin with? I, I, sorry, I was in the chat there. Just give me a moment. Yeah. So I
3802960	3812080	think in, in, I believe that this is our task as social researcher is to find the tools we need
3812080	3820800	to be able to, if the data does not allow us to go to that deeper level, which I think it doesn't
3820800	3827840	necessarily happen. So for example, if I, if I, if, if my entry point would be focus groups and I
3827840	3834160	do some discussion using a particular, you know, activity, and I want to trigger some conversations
3834160	3839120	about digital engagements, for example, with tools, how do you engage with what you engage, why you
3839120	3849040	engage, that data will only allow me to uncover this 10% the empirical level. If I want to go
3849040	3855760	deeper and explore these mechanisms that are there, I certainly need to put the theory in the
3855840	3862160	context of my research. Yes, I can't just say, you know, forget about my data and then go and look
3862160	3870400	for the theory that will allow me to identify which are the mechanisms that are responsible,
3871600	3876880	as we know, in an open system for these, for example, in my case, the lack of engagement.
3878400	3885040	Then I think you need to, with that in mind and your data, you need to go to the theory.
3885040	3890560	And there is where that combination, your experience as a practitioner in the field,
3890560	3896000	and having read quite a bit about the structures that you're exploring, I think you put them
3896000	3901600	together, but not necessarily the data allows you per se to go deeper into those levels. That's
3901600	3907200	how I see it. I'm not sure if there is another, and again, as Jack said, if anyone in the audience
3907200	3915360	would like to chip in, we're happy to do that because, yeah, that's kind of, yeah, my experience with it.
3920640	3927600	Okay, so I'm reading some of these questions. Yeah, I'm just just looking at the questions
3927600	3935440	to think of which one to answer. Maria is saying here, how do we know that we are actually unpacking
3935440	3943680	real as that unpacking is dependent on our perceptions? And this is a question I asked
3943680	3952160	myself a year and a half and every day, you know, how do I know that what I'm doing is real?
3952160	3958800	And yeah, Jack, if you want to jump into that one. Yeah. And so two thoughts on that one.
3958960	3965440	The first would be perhaps a bit of an unsatisfactory answer, but would be to say that critical
3965440	3970000	realism does insist on the fallibility of knowledge. I think I mentioned this to someone
3970000	3977200	in the chat earlier that critical realism is not offering kind of 100% certainty
3977200	3982080	in everything it does. Rather, it's trying to find the most compelling and convincing
3982800	3993680	understanding of reality using introspection and logic and as well as kind of our existing theories
3993680	3998960	and empirical understandings of the world. So it's trying to build the most compelling case
3998960	4006640	on the basis of that. On the other hand, perhaps, or hopefully giving a slightly more convincing
4007600	4016800	or slightly more satisfactory answer, hopefully, is that I think if we look at Baskar's argument
4016800	4023520	that there are underlying causal mechanisms in reality, I think there is, I personally find that
4023520	4030480	quite compelling because he asks what, how does the world have to be for us to kind of experience
4030480	4035760	it this way? How does the world have to be for science to be possible? He argues. So I would say
4035760	4041840	that although there are those skeptical challenges we were talking about earlier,
4041840	4048880	there is a degree of security we can have in our beliefs, even if we can't have certainty,
4048880	4052720	because our experiences of the world, especially when we talk to others and they have similar
4052720	4059920	experiences, do help us see or help us kind of follow the logic that Baskar's arguing.
4060240	4066400	Yeah, not a fully satisfactory answer, I'm aware, but hopefully that helps and I'd be interested
4066400	4074720	to hear other thoughts on that too. Yes, I think it's, yeah, it's not, and again,
4074720	4078560	you know, I don't think, I think the fallibility is something really important here and that's
4078560	4082560	going to happen. The epistemology you're going to, in the next seminar, you're going to explore that
4082560	4091280	deeper. But that's, I think that is an important part of the answer. Just picking another question
4091920	4100160	from the Q&A, which is again, this is quite blurry, but the question is quite interesting
4100160	4105920	regarding objects of study. The motto, don't go looking for something that doesn't exist,
4105920	4112560	seems sensible, but what about concepts that are intensely contested, or that many people
4112560	4119360	would question the basis of? And I think here, critical realism is interesting to work with
4119360	4130320	contested ideas. Are they real? Are they not real? And I would say this is kind of
4130640	4137920	reducing, again, the complexity of this philosophy of science, making a reduction in this instant
4137920	4144320	that I'm talking to you, which means this is not the only answer to this. But I think there is this
4144320	4150240	question, is it real? And if it's real, then I will study it using critical realism. Again, I'm in
4150240	4157120	this philosophy of science. So if it's not real, then I need to go for what is then the real aspect
4157120	4162640	of this phenomenon that I'm investigating. I think that's how I would approach this. And myself,
4163440	4169600	I'm looking at datafication as a phenomenon. Is it real? And why is it real? It's very contested.
4169600	4179280	What is it? What is it not? So I think, yeah, you know, and the basis of the real, again,
4180240	4189040	what you can say about is not definite, is not uncriticisable or academically,
4190160	4195200	you can always critique it and find a better explanation where you can say, well, you know
4195200	4201840	what, I think this is not real because that I'm here, I'm offering maybe this aspect of it
4201840	4205040	is real. And that's why it is, I think that is the way to go.
4206000	4217360	Thanks. And can I just pick up on the question from Gonzague and apologies by mispronouncing that.
4218400	4223360	Why do social researchers still not use critical realism in their inquiries?
4223360	4231280	What likely explanations could you provide on this issue? So it's difficult to kind of explain
4231280	4236800	why others aren't using your theory. I think that's always a problem with any kind of belief,
4236800	4243600	but just to share a couple of thoughts on that. One would be from my own discipline,
4243600	4249120	political science at least, and I'm sure it applies to others, that there isn't as much
4250880	4256720	critical reflection about our underlying ontologies and epistemologies as there should be.
4256720	4261920	It's something that lots of us learn at master's or PhD level. And then when lots of social
4261920	4267760	scientists go out to conduct research, the pressures of the academic world, perhaps,
4267760	4272960	and lots of other reasons might mean that they focus a lot less on their underlying ontology
4272960	4278720	and epistemology. So there is a kind of general lack of criticality that we could think about.
4278720	4283440	That would be one side of the explanation. And I think the other side of the explanation comes
4283440	4290400	from the influentialness of post-structuralism, and particularly the work of Foucault and others,
4290400	4297520	and those who have built on Foucault's work, who rejects the idea that the world contains
4297520	4304640	objects with essences, who reject the idea that the world contains structures, and instead
4304640	4312240	emphasise the fluidity and contingency of the world to the extent that there are no
4312240	4317440	entities within it. And I think there are lots of problems with that philosophical approach.
4317440	4324800	It's been very influential via Foucault and Judith Butler and others. I would personally
4324800	4328800	disagree with it, but I think that's one of the reasons that critical realism isn't more widely
4328800	4333840	used, because those who do reflect on their ontology and epistemology are often taking
4333840	4339200	this alternative post-structurist approach. So I think for those engaging with critical
4339200	4344960	realism as a theory in their thesis or research, that debate between critical realism and
4344960	4350800	post-structuralism I think is very helpful in outlining and defending a critical realist approach.
4351760	4360400	Yeah, and Stephen is saying that his supervisor says it's a cult, and I'm reminded by Ben Mansky,
4360400	4368240	who is part of the group of people organising the seminar, saying that in the United States,
4368240	4374800	where he is working, it's the same thing. It is something that is very, very much criticised as
4374800	4381360	a cult. And you know, again, I think there is really here, for me, my experience at least,
4381360	4388160	it needs to catch you. It needs to really ring a bell when you're doing your research. You just
4388160	4394000	kind of say, wow, this really is what I was looking for. This allows me to explain the
4394000	4400320	unexplainable until I got this, this kind of this philosophical approach to social science.
4400320	4408000	So I think also you need to really be, you're always going to be uncomfortable because I think
4408000	4412320	that is really what knowledge generates in us when we are creating this thing that we really
4412320	4417280	don't know. We're in this kind of really space where we don't know. But I think critical realism,
4418240	4423280	you know, it can be for different people, different things. And don't let yourself,
4424880	4430960	how do you say be deterred from using it? Because everyone, you know, they're people that defend,
4432960	4439120	you know, let's say new materialism, which has been a new, which also has a part of realism,
4439120	4446400	because Barat talks about agential realism. But there are, you know, there are people critiquing
4446480	4453840	this fiercely, others taking it and writing books. And so it's really, I think, what you,
4454480	4460480	your hunch, your inner investigator voice, what is it saying to you? And then you go
4460480	4464720	and explore it deep and you will be able to answer questions and, you know, and argue for
4464720	4469280	your position. It's not an easy one. Yeah, go for it.
4469280	4470480	Sorry, Caroline, after you.
4470480	4471520	No, go ahead, go ahead.
4471920	4477680	Yeah, I just wanted to come in and add to that, which is, as I said earlier, that quite a lot
4477680	4485440	of people who use critical realism also hold religious positions. And although I don't myself,
4485440	4492240	I'm personally an atheist. I think that often puts people off and people almost take the attitude
4492240	4498160	that religion doesn't have a place in social theory. But I would suggest that if you're religious,
4498240	4503520	then religion does have a place in social theory, because it is about your ontology
4503520	4508160	and how you understand the world to be. And we should be making that explicit and debating
4508160	4514480	and discussing it rather than trying to keep it separate. So that's one point. And I think the
4514480	4522160	other is that maybe some critical realist texts focus too much on only the critical realist tools
4522160	4528320	of understanding, whereas actually, I think the majority of those using critical realism
4528320	4534640	are exploring it in relation to other social theories, in relation to other social ontologies,
4534640	4539280	they're engaging at those boundaries and building those bridges. And I think that's where the really
4539280	4546480	interesting work is being done. So yes, that would be some thoughts on that question. And I just
4546480	4551760	want to very briefly say something that a few times in the chat, people have been talking about
4551760	4556880	abduction and retroduction. If those words are confusing you, we will come back to those in
4556880	4563040	future sessions. I'm sure that'll be picked up in the methodology, perhaps the epistemology
4563040	4567120	session and perhaps others as well. So we shall come back to those issues.
4568800	4576160	Yeah. And you know, I think social science is contested and that's the beauty of it.
4576160	4581520	And that's the richness as well. And I think the religion example is brilliant because I'm
4581520	4588560	myself an agnostic as well. And when I started to read about it, I really was puzzled with it.
4588560	4597360	And I was saying, you know, it stopped me in the sense of it made me read with more care.
4597360	4603440	And it made me read more to say, okay, let me see if this is really aligned with my ontology of the
4603440	4613760	world. But I think it's our position that we need to be able to defend it in our, if you're doing
4613760	4625360	your PhD in your Viva. I, for example, in mine, had quite hard questions to answer. But I knew it
4625360	4631440	because I really didn't understand anything about it when I started. And I think that is the important
4631440	4636560	thing. It doesn't matter if the people that are evaluating your thesis believe in it or not,
4636560	4642320	I think what is important, if you have been so coherent that you are arguing your methodology,
4642320	4648160	your explanation, your findings, the way in which you look at social change, non deterministic,
4648160	4652960	all of that, if that is in line, you'll be able to defend it. And is it that you're doing a research
4652960	4657040	project or your PhD, or you're doing something as a professional researcher, it doesn't matter,
4657040	4661680	but you will be able to, you know, to make a sound case. I think that that is key.
4664240	4671120	Excellent. I think we have answered the questions in the Q&A as far as I see it. But
4671840	4675680	I'd be very keen for people to raise their hands if they want to come in with
4675680	4680640	comments or other questions. We have eight minutes left. So if you do want to have other
4680640	4685360	comments you'd like to make or questions you'd like to ask, please type them in or raise your hand
4685360	4690480	and come in on the mic. It would be great to hear from some of you if there are any other
4690480	4694800	thoughts. We'll just give a minute or two to see if anything else comes in before we wrap up.
4696000	4703360	Yeah, Thanos, I think your comment is really to the point. So your supervisor said you're crazy
4703360	4711120	and at the end it's a great thesis. I think it allows really to make, because it is really,
4711120	4714880	you have to read to understand, you have to really go into it. It really allows it to
4714880	4721440	make a sound work. I think it was my case as well. And maybe just one other thing on that is that
4722240	4728080	it doesn't necessarily have to be the case that to use critical realism, you read everything that
4728080	4734560	is written by critical realists and mobilise it all as some kind of gigantic structure.
4734560	4740160	I think it's fine for you to be pulling out key ideas or key concepts that you find particularly
4740160	4745600	useful. As long as you're paying attention to ensure that there aren't key contradictions between
4745600	4750960	that and other parts of your theory, then it's okay to take parts from critical realism and
4750960	4755760	include that in your research. I don't think we should be concerned about whether you're
4755760	4762800	applying critical realism as a whole or not. And there our other sessions are going to be great.
4762800	4768160	I think the last one talks about the framework and how you then are able to include in your
4768160	4775040	scaffold structure these theories that make sense to your work. And there are people trying to build
4775040	4780400	bridges between one thing and the other, Frederick van den Berger being one of them. So there is a
4780400	4786960	lot of work going on in the social science and how can we communicate different maybe ways of
4786960	4791040	looking at the world who's using critical realism and the strength it offers.
4791600	4798160	Yeah, just another question or comment from Christopher about the relationship between
4798160	4804640	Paulson and Tilly's realist evaluation and the kind of more bascarian critical realist tradition.
4804640	4809600	So despite coming from the University of Leeds as both a Masters and PhD student,
4809600	4813680	I'm not that familiar with Paulson and Tilly. I have read realist evaluation,
4814400	4820720	but I'm not that familiar with their work or its influence. But I would say there's an interesting
4821200	4827200	divide really that is that there's a kind of blurred boundary there. There is an International
4827200	4832640	Association of Critical Realism Conference, and there is a realist evaluation conference.
4832640	4838400	So on the face of it, they look separate, but actually you'll find people using both at different
4839680	4845360	each conference, and you'll find people trying to overlap them in various ways.
4845760	4854320	I think they're basically different frameworks for social analysis that broadly accept some of the
4854320	4861040	same ontological positions would be a way of understanding it. Perhaps like I said,
4861040	4864880	I don't have the knowledge to go into a huge amount of depth about the precise differences
4864880	4870960	between them. But just as a more general comment is that Paulson and Tilly's realist evaluation
4870960	4880800	tends to be more widely and easily applied to policy and to more empirical research, and Bascar's
4881520	4889280	work tends to be more theoretically elaborate or in-depth, but is more a challenge to apply,
4889280	4894000	as some of you probably discovered. But hopefully the rest of the sessions in the series will
4894000	4898960	make that a little easier. Yeah, and that realist evaluation, I think what it really does, it
4899520	4906560	it uses these kind of concepts of generative mechanisms, the outcomes, and the context. I
4906560	4912240	think it does really use that, but then they use it in the way that is useful for them.
4913120	4918080	But I think they're, again, I don't know a lot, but I read two papers when I was trying to put
4918080	4924640	these causal pathways together from my own work, and it was illustrative in the sense of how do
4925200	4932640	you make your causal pathways? If you're explaining something, where are these mechanisms
4932640	4939040	really interacting and producing the outcome that I can see? It is helpful, but yeah, we don't need
4939040	4947280	to take things like lots of activity going in the chat, which is great.
4948160	4956000	Just to say that there's been one of the questions about when the realist evaluation
4956000	4960800	conference is. I don't know, but here's a website that should take you to the
4961920	4966640	details of the last conference, and hopefully through there you'll be able to find information
4966640	4967600	about the next one.
4967600	4977840	Yeah, and thank you for sharing your resources, which are quite useful as well,
4977840	4982800	so thank you for that. It enriches the space.
4984480	4992000	So I think without any further questions, I think we can draw the session to a close here.
4992000	4996800	I just want to say a huge thank you to everyone who's asked questions and contributed in the
4996880	5001840	chat. There's been absolutely loads going on there and loads of great exchanges of ideas,
5002480	5008240	and thank you all for attending. Make sure you come along to the next session on epistemology
5009040	5013680	and to follow the whole course through to the end, and we'd really appreciate your feedback
5013680	5019680	as well, so please drop us an email or get in touch with feedback and use the forums that
5019680	5025360	are on the Critical Realist Network website to ask questions and take the discussion forward as well.
5026800	5032400	Yes, thank you very much. It was a pleasure, and it's always so much that one learns being
5032400	5036400	in these spaces, so I'm grateful for your being here.
