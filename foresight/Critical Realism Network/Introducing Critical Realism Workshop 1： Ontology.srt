1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
Okay, brilliant. Shall we make a start then? I think most people have joined now, so welcome

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:15,360
everybody to the first session of the Introduction to Critical Realism webinars. Today we're talking

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,760
about ontology and this is the first of six and the following sessions will engage with epistemology,

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,680
methodology, approaches to analysis, key concepts and critical realism as a framework. So

5
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:38,000
yeah, make sure you do join the other sessions as well. So just a few very brief bits of housekeeping.

6
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:45,680
So firstly, please use the Q&A tool during the webinar. So if you have any immediate technical

7
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,680
issues or want to make a comment, use the chat box. But any questions that you have for us,

8
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,120
please put them in the Q&A section. And if you do that throughout the session, we'll try and pick

9
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,760
those up and make sure that we're answering all the questions. You can also comment on questions

10
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,920
in there and vote the ones that you really want to hear answered. Okay, so I think it'll be good

11
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,920
to start with some introductions. So I'll introduce myself. First of all, I'm Jack Newman from the

12
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,960
University of Surrey. My broader research interests are around British politics, social security policy,

13
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:27,680
local government. Although my interest in critical realism goes back about eight or

14
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,040
nine years to when I was doing my master's degree. And coming from a political science

15
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:40,640
background, I came across critical realism through the structure agency debate and trying to find a

16
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:48,480
suitable argument or solution to this problem of structure and agency. So that's my background

17
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,880
and how I came to critical realism. Caroline, do you want to introduce yourself too?

18
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,880
Yes. So I'm Caroline Coon, and I work at the University of Paspar as a lecturer there in the

19
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:06,480
School of Education. And I'm very interested in the combination of, I would say, technology,

20
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:13,120
education from a sociological perspective, I would say. And so I came to critical realism in a

21
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:21,600
later stage in my PhD where I, when I started to make sense of the data, I just couldn't

22
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,480
with what I had at hand. It wasn't possible for me. And I was really kind of struggling. And I

23
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,080
realized I need something to help me hear some theoretical kind of. And so I came across in a

24
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,920
conversation with someone at the University of Cape Town that they were using critical realism in

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,120
when they were exploring open educational resources. And once I started to read and read and read,

26
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,040
it was quite difficult at the very beginning. But I realized that was really what I needed to

27
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,840
make sense of what I was seeing in the data, particularly things that weren't there present,

28
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:02,240
that weren't, that they weren't showing, but that they were there. And yeah, so I started

29
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:07,280
to study it by myself because my supervisor didn't know anything about it, but he trusted me.

30
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:15,120
So I did a long journey into critical realism. And I think it is incredibly worth while our time.

31
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,920
And so that's how I came into it. Yes, that's me. Brilliant. I'll just say a couple more things,

32
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:28,080
and then we'll hopefully get some introductions from you guys, the audience. And so yeah, just to

33
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,120
be clear, if you have any technical issues or want to make comments or introduce yourselves,

34
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,480
please use the chat function. If you have any questions, please use the Q&A button,

35
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,680
or you can raise your hand as well during the discussion section. So here's how today's going

36
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:53,760
to run. We've got three parts to the webinar. Part one, we'll ask what is ontology. I know that this,

37
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,520
many of you will know what ontology is, but we're trying to make sure we kind of keep everyone

38
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:06,000
with us. And it's worth going back to, I think, for those who do not know already. And then we'll

39
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,760
talk about what a critical realist approach to ontology is. And then we'll conclude in the third

40
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,960
part by looking at the implications of a critical realist ontology. And hopefully we'll be taking

41
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:22,160
questions throughout and we'll have some discussion and we'll leave some extra time for discussion

42
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:29,440
at the end. And we're due to finish in about an hour and a half time. Okay, yeah, I'll hand back to

43
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:35,600
Caroline. Yeah, I was just wanting to ask the audience if anyone is keen to just introduce

44
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:43,440
themselves, what you do, do you study, do you work, and in a way, what brought you into critical

45
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:50,800
realism. We're a lot of people, it means we can't, not everyone can take the mic, but it would be

46
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,320
lovely to hear from some of you, so that we have an idea of who is in the room and the rest can

47
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,800
write it in the chat, which I see is already happening. There are lots of introductions

48
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:09,120
in the chat. So anyone who would like to take the mic, that would be great. Yeah, that is what we

49
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:22,160
would like to happen. Chris Roberts here. I'm relatively new to the field. I mean, years ago,

50
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,680
when I probably do my masters and I was sort of this thing called the internet had just been

51
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:35,360
discovered and I was, my supervisor was very much into sort of delusional guitaries, sort of bodies

52
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,920
without organs, and I found that a bit kind of radical. So I kind of moved from that more to

53
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:47,600
sort of constructivist view. My field is education, particularly health professional education,

54
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:56,000
but very, so it felt quite limited by what constructivist approaches to educational,

55
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,520
particularly transformational settings, you know, you know, trying to get sort of systemic

56
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:09,520
change in the health professionals education sector. But you know, the lack of sort of,

57
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:16,880
you know, sort of theories or sort of big models. And I guess then through a colleague or sort of

58
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:24,640
introduced to critical realism, it seemed to be a sort of really fit, good fit. It seemed to be

59
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:31,680
not rejecting some of the sort of the positivistic, post-positivist sort of positions, but critical

60
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:38,320
of them and seeing them in a very different way. And yet not seeing everything as sort of socially

61
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:45,760
constructed. There are noble things out there, but we just got fallible knowledge. So it just kind

62
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,720
of fitted for me. And I guess the work that I've been doing at the moment with colleagues

63
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:58,800
is more at that kind of the first, you know, the first sort of possibility of naturalism

64
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:05,280
kind of approach with this stratified ontology. I was thinking I was got some more to the, you

65
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,240
know, meta reality was just getting further and further away from a comfort zone. Although the

66
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:18,800
recent IACR, Frederick van der Berg was talking about, you know, how can you not want that project

67
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:25,440
of emancipation, a kind of sort of utopia in the air? And so shouldn't we consider the whole body

68
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:35,600
together? Thank you, Chris. That's great. And I would say, I mean, Deleuze and Guattari is so

69
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:41,280
different than critical realism. So it's just really fascinating how, you know, how theory

70
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,800
really in philosophy illuminates from different standpoints and different people from very

71
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,680
different angles. So great. And thank you, Chris. Anyone else?

72
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:02,800
Well, I see a lot of activity in the chat. So great. Shall we then, Jack?

73
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,600
David has his hand up. Yeah, thank you. I didn't see it.

74
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:18,960
David, go ahead. Oh, is that was that for me? Yeah. Yeah, so I'm David Palmer. I'm an anthropologist

75
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:26,640
at the University of Hong Kong. And I do a lot of work in relation to the anthropology of religion

76
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:37,760
in China and Asia. And I also, my work also goes into the sociology of religion. And I know

77
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,360
Phil Gorski, and he's been kind of promoting critical realism for the past many years. And I'm

78
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,800
actually, in a sense, from a postcolonial perspective, I'm quite interested in looking at how can we

79
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:55,040
seriously take different ontologies seriously? And what are the ontological foundations of

80
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:02,400
sociological theory and sociological methodology? So I'm, I'm, I think it's extremely important to

81
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:13,200
really have a deep awareness and critical thinking about the ontological assumptions of our own

82
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,040
discipline and the implications of that. And now moving directly into a project that I'm working

83
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,760
on now, I'm actually working on a book and a course, actually, that I'm going to be teaching

84
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:30,720
just in a couple of hours on science and religion, which I'm co teaching with an experimental physicist

85
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:39,600
who is a Christian. So we, we take, and I take more the Asian, like Taoist kind of perspective. So

86
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:48,880
we're really in trying to construct a framework for rethinking and reframing the relationship

87
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,800
between science and religion. We've come across a lot of concepts that are very,

88
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:58,480
that are very seem to resonate a lot with critical realism. So I would like to really

89
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,400
get a more systematic understanding of this approach.

90
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:10,720
Thank you, David. That's, that's great. Thank you. So interesting. Yes, Jack was saying so many,

91
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,160
you know, so different points of view and different needs as well. I think that is fascinating. Thank

92
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:25,040
you so much. I can't see hands up or anything. And, and also conscious of the time I shall,

93
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,480
we shall start our presentation. And, and, you know, we're welcoming the chat because we read it

94
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:37,840
then afterwards. And yeah, thank you so much. I'm reading here. Hasuki, Keinde, so interesting.

95
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:43,920
Thank you. Shall we start then, Jack? I am so Jack will go with the first part about what is ontology

96
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:52,160
in general terms. And I'll follow them. What is the critical realist understanding of this concept

97
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:58,880
of ontology? And then some practical and physical philosophical implications. Brilliant. Thanks,

98
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:05,360
Caroline. Yes. So let's get started with the question of what is ontology? And I'm sure some

99
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,640
of you have an idea. Some of you might think you have a good idea. And so let's just go through

100
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:18,640
the basics of what this, what ontology means. And I want to start out with this definition that you

101
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:25,360
always see in the textbooks here. So ontology is the philosophy of being an existence. Now,

102
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,720
I remember reading this in the textbooks back when I was a master's student and not really having a

103
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,400
clue what this meant. I think quite often it's a useful definition if you already know about ontology

104
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:42,560
but not very good as an introduction. So I just want to unpack this a little bit. So when we talk

105
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:49,360
about philosophy in this sense, what are we thinking about? So we're thinking about assumptions.

106
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:55,040
That's it. That is beliefs that people hold. They might not even realize they hold these beliefs.

107
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,560
We're talking about controversies. So areas of disagreement or debate. And we're talking about

108
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,840
theories. So systems of thought. They might be approaches to social science or they might be

109
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:16,240
religions perhaps. So ontology is a set of assumptions, controversies and theories.

110
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:22,720
What are they about? Moving to the right hand side of the slide there, we're thinking about being and

111
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:29,360
existence. So what do we mean by being an existence in this context? So when we're thinking about being,

112
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:36,080
we could think about the essence, experience or state of consciousness of living things.

113
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:43,040
What it is to be a person in the world or perhaps what it is to be an animal or non-person in the

114
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:50,960
world. And then much more broadly than this and perhaps more importantly, to ontology is also

115
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:57,600
about existence in general. Everything that is in some way real beyond our perception of it.

116
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,960
So yes, it's about our experience in the world. It's also about how the world actually is

117
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,160
outside of our experience. So yeah, when we're talking about ontology, we're thinking about

118
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:16,880
the assumptions, controversies and theories that are about reality in general, I suppose.

119
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,560
Okay, so I want to introduce a couple of skeptical challenges just to get us start

120
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,960
thinking about ontology. I pulled out a couple of quotes from Descartes here who is kind of

121
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:38,880
one of the key philosophers of modern Western philosophy. And he argues in his or writes in

122
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:45,360
his meditations, there is the fact that I'm sitting here seated by the fire, attired in a dressing

123
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,480
gown. So that's what that's where he was when he was writing his meditations. But and here's where

124
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,680
the challenge comes in. How often has it happened to me that in the night I dreamt that I found

125
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:01,920
myself in this particular place, that I was dressed and seated near the fire whilst in reality,

126
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:08,960
I was lying undressed in bed. So Descartes raises the problem of how we know that we're awake and

127
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:14,960
not dreaming. And if you go to menti.com there and enter the code, some of you have done so already,

128
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:20,000
if so go on to the next slide. And it'd be great if you could answer the poll that's on there just

129
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:25,200
to have a think about this. Yes, and I'm here waiting for your answers to just see what you

130
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:30,080
think if you're dreaming or if you're not dreaming, or if you're if you're not sure about what's

131
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:38,560
happening. Because the interesting thing here is to kind of challenge our thinking about whether

132
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:45,680
our day to day perception of reality is really giving us a true window or a true insight into how

133
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:55,120
the world really is around us. I'll just give you a moment to have a think about that one. Yes, I'm

134
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:02,320
here. Sorry, Jack, what was the particular question again? So if you go to menti.com there and enter

135
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,520
that code, it should give you a question for you to answer. The current question is,

136
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:18,880
are you 100% sure you're not dreaming right now? So I have six people that are not dreaming, seven,

137
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:24,880
eight. And then I have two people that are not really sure. And two people that are dreaming. So

138
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:32,640
we have 12 now that are not dreaming. And we're still have two that not three now that they are

139
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:43,920
dreaming. Yes, 13, that 14 that are not dreaming, three that are not sure. So I think the tendency

140
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:53,840
is to think that you're not dreaming. Okay, so you guys have a fairly, a fair amount of certainty

141
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:58,640
that your perceptions are giving you a true indication of reality perhaps. Yes, 15.

142
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:06,720
Wow. Okay, let's take another similar question then, just to get us to think about this question

143
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,920
of our immediate perception of the world around us. So I don't know whether anyone's seen the film

144
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:18,080
The Matrix. I recommend it, if not, it's a good film. But I just want to introduce a premise here.

145
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:27,600
In the top picture there, this chap, Neo, is living in the world day to day,

146
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:34,640
and he gets met by this person, Morpheus, who explains to him that actually he's not living

147
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:39,520
in the world. He's really laid in one of these tanks that you can see in the bottom picture.

148
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:45,520
And a simulation of reality is being pumped into his mind. So that's the kind of premise of the

149
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:52,480
film there. So Morpheus says, Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that seems you seem so sure it was real?

150
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,960
If we're unable to wake up from that dream, how would you tell the difference between the dream

151
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:02,720
world and the real world? Now, I'm not trying to, again, you can go to Mentimeter and answer the

152
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,360
question there. I'm not trying to convince you that we're all living in a simulation far from it.

153
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:13,680
I'm just trying to open the prospect that our day to day perceptions don't give us a kind of clear

154
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:21,120
picture on what reality is really like. And reality may be other than our perception of it

155
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,560
on a day to day basis. And Chris is saying in the chat, I'm not dreaming that I cannot

156
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:34,640
connect to the Mentimeter pool. Sorry, Chris. Yeah, it not always works. I have it in front of me.

157
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,680
It is active. And I'm sorry if it doesn't work. It's just that sometimes happens.

158
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:47,680
But I like your answer. It's a good answer. I also quite like Mauricio's answer that in his,

159
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,960
in dreams, I don't pay bills. And that's how I know. Yeah.

160
00:17:51,920 --> 00:18:01,120
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I'm here. I'm keen to see if it's possible to live. One is saying I'm

161
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,880
no, it's not possible to live in a simulation. And another one says yes, it is. And then we have

162
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,880
two people, but three people that don't think four, that we were living in a five, that we're

163
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:21,040
living in a simulation, five people and six people. And then we have three that that yes,

164
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:27,600
we can live in a simulation. So it's eight, nine and three. So nine or more. No, we can't.

165
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:39,680
And three that yes. And then 10, no. So yeah, 11, 12. It's a tendency again here, isn't it? But

166
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:46,480
yeah, that people don't think it's possible that we're living in a simulation 13 and three has

167
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:52,960
stayed stable in the yes answer. So yeah, it's, it's interesting really to just think about this,

168
00:18:52,960 --> 00:19:01,040
I would say, for say yes. Yeah. A lot more, a lot more certainty in this group than yesterday's group.

169
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,720
Yesterday's group were all very skeptical and worried that they were dreaming and worried

170
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:11,040
that they might be living in a simulation. You guys are a lot more sure of your place in reality.

171
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:17,280
Okay, so thanks for taking part in that. I think it's useful to start thinking about these

172
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:23,680
ontological questions, but I just want to distinguish between two sets of questions here,

173
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:30,000
between ontology on the one hand and epistemology on the other hand. Epistemologies will be covered

174
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,600
in next week's session, actually. So when we're thinking about ontology in relation to many of

175
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,720
the issues we've just been discussing, we're thinking about questions, is there a reality

176
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,960
beyond our experience of the world? And then what is the nature of that reality? Is it, for example,

177
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,880
a simulation or not could be one such question? And what is the difference between reality and

178
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,000
experience anyway? Even is there a difference? Whereas epistemology is very much more looking

179
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,080
at questions of knowledge. What counts as knowledge? How is it that we can come to know

180
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:07,040
anything? And can we be certain of anything? And what do we mean by truth? These are questions

181
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:12,240
of epistemology that will be tackled next week. Now, some approaches kind of reject the distinction

182
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:18,640
between these or try and blur the distinction. Critical realism tries to look at the two

183
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:26,800
separately. And this week we'll be focusing on ontology. So I've got one more problem or question

184
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:34,720
for you, which is about friendship, the idea of friendship. Now, do you think that friendship

185
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:41,680
is just a way of describing the thoughts and actions of two individuals? Or is a friendship

186
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:48,080
between, excuse me, two people also a real thing in its own right? So just to rephrase that I'll

187
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:55,520
say it again, is friendship just a word we use, just as shorthand to describe what two individual

188
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:02,960
people are doing? Or do you think that friendship is a real thing in the world? Is it some object or

189
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:09,280
real thing? So I'd be very interested to hear your thoughts about this. Either put your responses

190
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:16,080
in the chat box or raise your hand perhaps and we can get one or two people responding on the

191
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:21,360
microphone. So yeah, do share some thoughts on this. While we wait here, I just wanted to take

192
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,480
something that I find quite interesting in the chat. Those critical realism offer the red pill,

193
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:33,520
so we can see what is really happening behind the simulation. And I just, why do I pick this?

194
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:39,120
Because this is an interesting question that you will be kind of fleshing out throughout the six

195
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:47,360
sessions. And I think today maybe it points to that. I don't have the answer, but it's interesting.

196
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:54,160
And I hope that you can find some pointers, I think, in these six sessions.

197
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:02,080
Yeah, so here we have it's ideationally real. I think friendship is real, but it is bound in time.

198
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:09,680
Friendship is not an object, but it's real. So it's an entity. Yes, okay. Or the effect of friendship

199
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:17,040
are real. Yeah, there we have the effects. Friendship is like wetting your pants. Everyone can see it,

200
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:24,960
but only you know it's real warmth. That's a good way of describing it. I think friendship is real

201
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:32,160
and has many layers. Yes, social, cultural, and personal layers. Yes, it's about the layers. That's

202
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:37,200
a good point. It appears and disappears. But when it's there, it's certainly there.

203
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:47,920
Yeah, great. Thank you. So many answers. Yeah, quite a lot of people who are giving critical

204
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:54,800
realist answers as well. And I just want to clarify what that means just with one final

205
00:22:54,800 --> 00:23:03,120
slide here. From a critical realist perspective, how do we know something is real? So a kind of

206
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:11,280
traditional criteria that Baskar points out is the perceptual criteria for reality. So if the

207
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:17,360
phenomenon, say friendship, can be perceived, then it is real. But Baskar argues that that's not enough.

208
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:24,000
That's not enough to decide whether something is real or not, because there are some things we

209
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,600
perhaps can't perceive, but still want to insist they're real. So there's also the causal criteria

210
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,880
for reality. And I think some people were getting at this in the chat box. For something to be real,

211
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:41,360
it needs to be causally efficacious. That means it needs to be able to cause an effect in the

212
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:48,480
world. It needs to create an outcome. So it may not be a cause that is triggered. So it may not

213
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,040
be a cause that actually has an outcome, but it could be a cause that has the potential to have

214
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:58,800
an outcome. So this causal criteria for reality is one we could apply for friendship. As somebody

215
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:05,200
said there in the chat box, so a friendship has effects in the world. And this could be the basis

216
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:12,160
of which we argue that is real. Okay, that's me done for this section on what is ontology.

217
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:17,920
I'll just give you guys a moment to ask some questions if you want, using the Q&A feature,

218
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:22,960
or to raise your hand and come in on the microphone. If you have any questions or want to

219
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,880
share any thoughts at this point, and then in a moment we'll start the next session, the next section.

220
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,240
Any questions?

221
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:49,120
There's one hand up from Mauricio. Okay, yeah, Mauricio.

222
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:56,240
Hi, I think one interesting question would be who cares or why care about

223
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:03,280
the reality of reality from a critical realist perspective. Thank you.

224
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,800
Okay, do you have any thoughts on that before we answer?

225
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:17,760
Yes, I come from Sociologists of Discipline, so to me the fact that something is real is in that

226
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:25,760
critical realist viewpoint means that it is in a way oppressive. It's something that happens,

227
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,840
whether you want it or not, like paying bills. And therefore, it is important because

228
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,480
things that are real are the things that can be analyzed, can be described, and so on.

229
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,240
And I think it is important to distinguish between what is real and what is not,

230
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:55,360
and in order to give enough, I think credence, but also weight, but also analytical importance

231
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:01,040
to things that are real beyond the objectively perceptive and so on. So for me that's,

232
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:08,240
I study how a constitution was made, so to me looking at that mechanism is important because

233
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,320
it's a real mechanism that has real effects on the social structure, for example.

234
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:19,680
Okay, brilliant. Yeah, I think you've answered the question very well. I'll just add one other

235
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:25,680
thought which is thinking about a kind of discipline, a social science discipline,

236
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:30,880
and going about establishing the theories and deciding what to research there. And I think

237
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:37,040
when we're working out what isn't real, it's very important for deciding what the main concepts

238
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:41,760
are going to be for the discipline. What are we going to investigate? What aspects of the world

239
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:50,080
are we going to ask about or focus on? So I think that would be another aspect that builds on your

240
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:55,920
thoughts there. Okay, brilliant. Caroline, any other thoughts or any other questions?

241
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:01,520
Yeah, there are two things here. I want to say that one of the things that critical realism

242
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:07,120
really advocates for is emancipation. And to be honest, I think what it really

243
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:14,240
offers us is a theory of social change. I mean, I'm simplifying this. Not only it's a philosophy

244
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:25,200
of science, but I think it is really geared to be able to intervene in the cogs of the machinery

245
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:31,920
of society. And I think, yes, it is important to ask the question, who cares and why should we care?

246
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:38,400
And there is where critical realism offers us tools and ways of thinking that we can then

247
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:45,920
enact some change. Yeah, there is an interesting question here about friendship and structures.

248
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:51,680
If it is a structure, although it's only between two people, I mean, can we say friendship is a

249
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:56,880
social structure even only between two people? And that's an interesting question. Jack, I'm not sure

250
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:05,520
if you have any thoughts around this. Is this really very nuanced things that makes us be confused

251
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:11,120
at moments? Is it a structure because it's only between two people? Is one individual a structure?

252
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:17,440
How is that? I think there are very differing, or my review is that there are very differing

253
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,360
understandings of the word structure in the literature. So you always have to be careful

254
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:28,960
when you're reading the word in a sociologist or even a critical realist. So I think Popora,

255
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,600
who someone mentioned earlier, gives one of the best critical realist understandings of

256
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:40,800
social structure. And he talks about relational structures between social positions in society.

257
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:45,120
Tony Lawson is another one that gives a good understanding of structure here. So I would

258
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:52,080
say that a friendship is part of the social structure, is part of relational social structures.

259
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:57,840
Whether we say it's a structure in itself, I don't know, I think that depends on how you're

260
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:03,440
using the word really. But I would certainly say that friendships are part of the social structure,

261
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,800
relations between people, positioned people. And I think it will also, when you do your

262
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:14,640
research, and if you are researching friendship in particular, you will then be reading different

263
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,840
definitions and you will see what suits your investigation as well. So I think that that

264
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:27,840
is something that is important. So yeah, it's fascinating so many. There are other questions

265
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:34,240
in the chat. There is one which I think might be interesting about the difference between ontology

266
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:43,280
and metaphysics. I would say this is a broad question that it might take more time than what

267
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:50,800
we have to clarify. If there is any, I don't know, short answer there, Jack, I'm not sure. I think

268
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:58,640
it's a really broad and deep question. Yeah, and maybe just one quick thought on the difference

269
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,640
there would be that ontology tends to be concerned with the category, categories of things that are

270
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:10,240
real. So what are the parts of the world that we define as real? And how do we kind of organize

271
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:17,920
those categories? Whereas metaphysics as a whole tends to be thought of as a larger concern

272
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:23,600
that includes those kind of skeptical questions I was asking at the start and is a broader question

273
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:29,920
about the underlying natures and structures of the universe. Although there are clearly overlaps

274
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:34,320
between the two, significant overlaps between the two, that's one way of thinking about the

275
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:42,080
difference, perhaps. Yeah, okay, so I believe, and again, aware of the time and conscious of the

276
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:49,600
time that we will continue with our second part, which will be more focused on the critical

277
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:59,680
realist ontology and what is it in critical realism? That is defining of realities of what is real.

278
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:06,320
And so if you go to the next slide, please, Jack. Yeah, so to begin with, we have always these two

279
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:12,720
worlds, the natural world and the social world. And Baskar already in his critical naturalism

280
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:20,880
says that these two worlds are not apart and he didn't want to make kind of a sharp difference.

281
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:26,880
Nevertheless, he said, we can't reduce one to the other in so far that is critical. So the

282
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:34,960
social world can't be reduced to the natural world. And it has its properties and it is, we have to

283
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:43,840
study it as something that really emerges as part of the natural world. And so one of the things I

284
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:50,320
think here that I, you can see underneath this pictures is that you in the natural world would

285
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:56,320
do experimentation. So you have a closure really, your experiment is like a closure of that natural

286
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:03,200
world. And then you want to predict and then find these causal laws, whereas in the social world,

287
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:09,280
you would be exploring. And you can't do any closure because it is an open system. And we're

288
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:15,360
going to go into into that open system definition in the next slide. And but what you can do really

289
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:21,280
is explain, but you can't predict. I think this is one of the key things in critical realism.

290
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:27,760
And if we go to the next slide, Jack, please. So here, I would say, are these kind of three

291
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:40,240
main tenants of how social reality is defined in critical realism. And it's really stratified,

292
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:45,760
it's deep, so we don't have a flat ontology, which is only what we can see. It's an open and

293
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:51,280
complex system. So stratified. And we're going to I'm going to explain these three things in detail,

294
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:57,760
but just stratified means that we have levels of reality. An open system means that this social

295
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:04,160
world is really multi determined. So we have multiple causalities. And we don't know accurately

296
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:12,720
these causes, which counter the other, which reinforce others, which cancel others. So it's

297
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,280
really this kind of very multi determined space. And that's why it's an open system.

298
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:27,280
And emergence is the property that emerges from systems that are complex. And so in I would say,

299
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:34,320
and please, this is a simplification. Yeah, there is a lot of explanation deeper. And so that's

300
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:40,240
the reading that you do. But this is just kind of to pinpoint main things. So you can't really

301
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,960
rely on on empirical data, if you want to answer your research question from a critical

302
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:51,920
realist perspective, because the world is much more than than what we can see, perceive, and you

303
00:33:51,920 --> 00:34:02,640
know, what catches the eye. And the next one, Jack, please. And here this, this metaphor of the iceberg,

304
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:08,080
I think, not me, many think that it's a very good metaphor to explain this stratified or

305
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:13,680
stratification of reality. And although I'm going to start from the bottom up, because I think

306
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:20,800
in the in this kind of the iceberg really tells us that if an iceberg is to stand there for million

307
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:27,920
and millions of years, it's because it has a strong mass underneath the water, and it gives

308
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:32,560
its solidity. And I think that's a really good thing to think about when we are investigating

309
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:39,040
social reality under a critical realist perspective. So these generative mechanisms,

310
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:45,520
which are those that make things happen in the world, they live underneath of what we can see,

311
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:51,280
they're really invisible, most of the times, at first sight, I mean, here. Then what happens is

312
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:56,560
that these generative mechanisms interact with each other and then events happen. But these

313
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,920
events not necessarily can be observed all the time. So they live also underneath the water,

314
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,440
but they happen, although we can't see them when these generative mechanisms interact with each

315
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:14,000
other. And then what happens is at the empirical level are these events that we really can observe.

316
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,880
But this is only just the 10% of that reality that we're investigating. So again, I think the main

317
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:29,040
takeaway here is don't trust what you can see and just go deeper. Yeah, the next one, please.

318
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:35,200
And so this is really, again, just kind of putting together these ideas of we start with

319
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:40,640
the empirical level, because yes, it's what we can see. It's what we talk with our participants,

320
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:46,160
is what we find out about the reality we are interested in. But this only opens the door

321
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:52,480
through then using theory that allows you then to go to this deeper level where the structures

322
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:59,200
and this generative power or mechanism are, I would say, hidden most of the times. And that's

323
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:04,880
why emancipation, I think for me at least, is something that we really thrive for when we

324
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:09,760
use critical realism. What is that invisible thing that is, and someone said oppressive,

325
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:15,120
yes, these structures normally are oppressive. So how can we really see them? The next one, please,

326
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:25,280
Jack. And the open system that I was mentioning before is, I think I don't have to explain that

327
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:32,640
much, but what it really means is that the social world is a causal network of interacting forces

328
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:40,320
that counteract each other, reinforce each other, cancel sometimes. So it's very difficult to really

329
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:48,720
say something in a predictive manner. So if A is here, B will happen. It's not necessarily the case.

330
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:54,400
And so you can't really make any closure. You have to be always aware that you can only say

331
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:01,840
so much about social reality. The next one, please, Jack. And what this really brings us to think about

332
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:07,600
that we are not working with causal laws. We're really doing multiple causality. That's what

333
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:12,880
we're looking for. Are there multiple causes that are responsible for the event that we are

334
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:18,720
investigating? And human beings are themselves open systems. And I was thinking about this when

335
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:25,440
you asked about the question of structure and friendship. So we are open systems and we're

336
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:32,160
capable of communication, creativity and resistance. This means that there is always the

337
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:38,320
possibility of something new happening. And this, I think, is an evidence that we really can't predict

338
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,320
because there is always something new happening. There is always some creation that we have not

339
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:48,480
expected or that is not. We couldn't really predict for that. The next one, please, Jack.

340
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:56,800
And the phenomenon of emergence, I think, is quite interesting because it refers to the

341
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:03,360
properties that arise when different parts constitute a whole. And the flock of birds is

342
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:10,560
an example that I have used to illustrate this because I think it really makes the case of how,

343
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:18,080
when birds are together, things arise. So an emergent entity is constituted by the parts,

344
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:25,040
how they are arranged in relation to one another. And the unique properties, the whole holds

345
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:30,400
due to the arrangement of the parts. So what we can see here, I would say three important things,

346
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:37,840
the parts, the arrangement of these parts. How are they arranged? And then they form this whole

347
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:45,440
and what is this whole? And if we go to the next slide, there is a more precise explanation of this,

348
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:51,600
which is really, this is from National Geographic, a study about flock of birds. And what I want to

349
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:58,000
take from this example is that, so I'm going to read the left hand side. While it sounds like

350
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:04,960
waves spread best in bigger flocks, the waves transmitting information about direction spread

351
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:12,080
best in smaller flocks. So here we can see how the size of the flock matters for the effect

352
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:17,440
or the property that is going to emerge, namely how they change direction when they do their

353
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:25,680
emigration, or also sometimes when they arrive to a particular space. So smaller flocks tend to

354
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:33,520
have a more rigid behavior, if you wish, because the waves travel more quickly. So what I want to

355
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:40,320
stress here is that the way in which these birds are arranged, is there a big flock,

356
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:46,800
is it a small flock, really determines the effect of the transmission of the information

357
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,920
about the direction. And I think that is key, although this is in the natural world, but

358
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:59,200
Pascal said they're not different. They are in a way different, but they are as well together.

359
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:06,320
So the next slide, please. And the same thing happens here with fish, shawls, it is exactly the

360
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:10,400
same, how they behave together is completely different than what they do by themselves.

361
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:21,040
And the next one, please, Jack. What is really the aim of social science and OSAS researcher

362
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:27,360
is to discover these emergent properties. So the entities, the agents, the structure,

363
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:31,760
and their emergent generative power, this is really, or the mechanism, what social

364
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:38,960
science is about. All of this is within a critical realist perspective. And this in society,

365
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:45,760
if you go to the next slide, Jack, what it allows us really to see here, and I'm not going to read

366
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:51,120
all of that. I'm conscious about the time. I'm going to just go to the last bit. A context where

367
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:57,120
the resources are allocated unevenly will have different effects on the individuals that operate

368
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:03,680
within it. And here we see the whole is the society, how the parts, which in this case are the resources,

369
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:09,840
are allocated, how these are arranged in a society have effects and they have different

370
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:14,800
effects. If you think about Latin America, I'm going to talk about Venezuela, particularly my

371
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:22,320
experience to not generalize resources are incredibly unevenly allocated. Now, how society

372
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:29,520
lives there is incredibly different than if we think about Norway or England, although I know

373
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,480
things are changing, but nevertheless, the resources are allocated in a different way than

374
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:40,880
in Venezuela. And we see how society and its individuals have completely different effects

375
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,360
in how they live. And then that does as well as we are, you know, that then brings to different

376
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:53,840
and different consequences. And so I think with this, I think that if you go to the next slide,

377
00:41:53,840 --> 00:42:00,640
I think this is the, yeah, that the so what I believe is important here is that we look at

378
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:06,640
these three things. So how can we go to these deeper layers of society or social reality, sorry,

379
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:13,440
how we should not stay in the empirical, how we always need to be conscious that what we are

380
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:20,400
investigating is an open system. And in every open system, it's we have this complexity when things

381
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:29,280
just come together. And in the coming together, and here is I think the social structures as

382
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:36,800
Tony Lawson defines is the this is really about the positions of these parts. So I think here,

383
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:41,680
yeah, those are the three things that we should kind of take into account when we investigate.

384
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:46,080
And these generative powers are really the object of analysis, what are they and what are they doing?

385
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:53,280
And I, yeah, if you have any questions, I think this is a good time to just break a bit

386
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,360
the talking. And any question, if someone would like to take the mic, I think there are some

387
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:05,680
questions. Yeah, so there's there's a few questions that have that I've dug out of the chat. So if you

388
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:11,680
do have questions, please pop them in the Q&A section, just make some a bit easier for us to

389
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,840
find an answer, especially when there's a few coming in at once. But just I want to go back to a

390
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:24,640
few that came out of the chat from from earlier on. And so we have one from Stephen, with the

391
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:31,360
that I think builds on the discussion of friendship, saying wouldn't this imply that ideas as real as

392
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:39,760
objects. And I think that's a really interesting question. And I would I would personally say

393
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:45,680
yes, I mean, it depends what you mean by as real as something, but just just to kind of just define

394
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:52,480
and back the answer up. And if you think about the human individual, and argue that the URIs

395
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:58,240
an individual person is real, then we could say that actually, we're just made up of smaller parts,

396
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:02,320
as Caroline has just been saying, and that those are real, and that those are made up of smaller

397
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:08,400
parts, and those are real. So unless we believe that there's some bottom layer of reality from

398
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:14,000
which that is the only thing that's real, if we want to claim that we as people and other

399
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:20,000
objects we see around us are real, and I think it makes just as much sense to say that ideas and

400
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,760
social structures that emerge from us are real objects. And one final thought on this building

401
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:32,880
on the causal criteria for reality is that critical realists talk about reasons being causes,

402
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,760
and the way that the reasons we do things, the justifications for things, the ideas we have

403
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:44,960
about things can be causes. So hopefully that answers the question, but do come back in the chat

404
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:50,800
or by raising a hand if you want to. Caroline, were there other questions? I have a couple more

405
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:55,760
here, but I don't know if you have any at your side. I'm just looking at the Q&A, but I think we'll

406
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:01,120
leave them to the end. Is that right? Okay, yeah. Daniel has a hand raised. Daniel, did you want to

407
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:10,560
come in? I just would be interested. I know that Pascal is making a difference between a transitive

408
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:19,200
and intransitive dimension. Would that not be an important concept to discuss friendship?

409
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,800
Okay, just want to elaborate on that a little bit just to clarify.

410
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:31,200
Sorry, I didn't understand. What do you mean? Yeah, could you just say a little bit more just

411
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:38,720
to be clear on why that you think that relates to friendship? Yeah, I'm just good to have it.

412
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:49,840
Okay, I'm not totally sure, but I would say that Pascal would say that in a friendship as I wrote

413
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:58,080
in the chat that there are different layers of friendship. And perhaps regarding a personal

414
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:09,520
friendship, I have with somebody that something that can change quite quickly. But the concept

415
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:16,800
of friendship, what we do think of friendship is something we have in our culture. And that's not

416
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:24,320
that easy to change our ideas. And I think if I understand Pascal right, he would even say that

417
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:31,280
behind the concept and our cultural ideas about friendship, there is something deeper

418
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:40,000
in reality and a lethic level where friendship is real and does not change. Would you agree?

419
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:49,120
Okay, yeah, no, I think I would agree. That's really interesting. So we have the transitive

420
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:56,880
dimension being the dimension of knowledge and knowing and the tools of understanding, so to

421
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:02,640
speak, the way in which we understand and explain the world and the intransitive being the world

422
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:07,760
itself, the thing we're studying and looking at. So I'm really just repeating your answer back to

423
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:14,160
you, Daniel, but just for clarity for some of those who are listening. And so when we're talking

424
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:20,080
about the transitive, we're thinking about how we see friendship as a society, perhaps how we see

425
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:27,200
friendship as sociologists, maybe, as well. But then there is something real going on as well

426
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:33,040
underneath there. There are causal mechanisms that mean that a friendship between two people can have

427
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:39,200
effects in the world. It's real regardless of whether other people acknowledge it or notice it

428
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:45,680
or study it or not. So I think that's the idea of the distinction there. And hopefully that's

429
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:52,320
answered the question. Please do come back if not. Caroline, is there anything else to pick up on?

430
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:58,560
No, well, I think that if it has effects, this is one thing where we then need to say, okay,

431
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:04,400
wait, let me go deeper here. Let me think about this. I think this is really the kind of first

432
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:11,520
thing where you say, okay, this has effects. And that's the criteria that we used in our last slide

433
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:17,440
to when something is real and when it's causally efficacious. So I think that is really something

434
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:26,640
to think about. But yeah, brilliant. Even Daniel was saying it, right? We've got quite a few of the

435
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:31,520
questions here. Shall we take these or should we take the next section and come back to them all at

436
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:40,720
the end? I suggest, yeah, we don't have that much to go. So we could take the next section and then

437
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:45,280
we start with our Q&A. And in our last half an hour, I would say that would be great.

438
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:51,120
Okay, that's a good idea. So we don't have, yeah, we only have a couple of slides left each. So we'll

439
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:56,320
say this and then we'll open a bit more space for others to come in and to answer some of these

440
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:01,440
other questions that are in the chat and Q&A. Brilliant. Okay, so thinking about the implications

441
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:06,400
of a critical realist ontology, I just want to quickly look at a few philosophical implications.

442
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:12,560
There are perhaps a lot more than I've summarised on this slide here, but just to raise a few.

443
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:17,760
So firstly, one implication is that there is a reality beyond our experience of it.

444
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:23,360
So I think that's, I suppose, might be obvious to some people, but is an important

445
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:29,600
point to make when we're conducting social science and to be aware of that there is a

446
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:35,120
reality beyond our experience. Perhaps more controversially, the implication of critical

447
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:40,240
realism is that there's a reality beyond actual events. So there are potential causes that could

448
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:45,760
have been triggered or could have happened that didn't. And we can think about these as being

449
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:53,120
part of the real, these causal mechanisms or causal properties of entities. And there's this

450
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:58,240
point that reality is not necessarily how it appears to us, which raises that problem about

451
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:05,280
whether we can be sure about the world around us and about reality, which gives us that fallibility

452
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:10,720
although we can generate knowledge on the basis of assumptions we find compelling,

453
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:16,800
we can't be 100% sure we might always be wrong. So, and then finally, I just want to go to these

454
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:21,360
bullet points at the bottom of the slide and highlight that when we're conducting research,

455
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:29,760
we need to consider both causality and meaning. So traditionally, positivists have focused on

456
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:35,200
causality and interpretivists have focused on understanding meaning. Critical realism calls

457
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:42,080
for us to do both to try and explain society and explain causality and to understand meaning as well.

458
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:48,720
We need to focus on both structures and agents, so both the social context in which people live

459
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:54,480
and their unique kind of creative powers as individual agents to make change in the world.

460
00:50:55,520 --> 00:51:00,160
We need to understand relations between people, so those friendships we were talking about,

461
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:04,720
but maybe also those, or maybe even more importantly, those economic relationships

462
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:12,160
like landlord and tenant, for example, or employer and employee. But then we also need to understand

463
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:18,640
and think about relations between ideas and the way in which two ideas might contradict one another

464
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:24,800
and this might have causal consequences in the world. Archer talked a lot about this in her

465
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:31,760
theory on culture and uses examples from religion where contradictions arise in the Bible and that

466
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:37,920
has a causal impact on how society develops. And then finally, we need to think about both the

467
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:46,400
natural and social. So as Caroline has said, critical realism insists that we need a kind

468
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:51,440
of general philosophy for understanding both and although the social world is very different in

469
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:57,440
lots of ways, we need to be aware of both. And when we're studying society or our various

470
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:04,800
disciplines in social science, we need to be aware of our bodies and the physical world around us

471
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:11,120
as well as the kind of ideas and discussion and language and discourse, etc. Okay, so those are

472
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:16,240
just a quick run through some philosophical implications. I hand over to Caroline for more

473
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:23,280
practical implications. Yes. And thank you, Jack. I want to again insist that these implications,

474
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:31,200
particularly the practical ones, are going to be kind of unfolding along these seminars.

475
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:36,560
So I do encourage you to go to all of them because I'm just kind of, you know,

476
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:45,120
I'm even touching the tip of the iceberg because there are epistemological implications which

477
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:53,040
are going to be addressed in the second seminar. One thing that in my experience, I have experienced

478
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:58,960
myself, is very important, is the critical realism so that philosophy of science has an

479
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:05,200
immediate implication in my research design or in our research design. What is the methodology?

480
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:10,720
Which are the methods I'm going to use to collect which data? Is it enough? Does it

481
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:18,240
allow me to go deeper? Or does it open the door to then go deeper? And I think that is one of the

482
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:27,920
key things that, yeah, one needs to be aware if I'm using this, okay, what are the implications for

483
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:33,920
my methodology for my design of my investigation? And it's always important to ask, what is the

484
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:39,040
nature of the object that we're investigating? What is it made of? What are the constituent parts?

485
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:47,680
What are these? How are they? I think Jack was saying these kind of basic concepts, which are

486
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:56,000
they? I need to really be very aware that that is very, very important. And if you read, I think

487
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,800
someone made that comment in the chat at the beginning, the guide that Tom Fryer did, which is

488
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:07,120
really an amazing work, that also I think signals, at least for me, a deep understanding and that's

489
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:12,800
why he's able to do the comics of it, because it's a deep understanding that has been really put to

490
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:18,080
and brought to another level. So you don't go looking for something that doesn't exist. And so you

491
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:24,400
don't ignore the full reality of the world. And if you set up off with a bad theory of ontology,

492
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:30,880
you really are risking that you'll end up with a math project or, yeah, or just,

493
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:39,280
yeah, it can go really wrong, I have to say, if our ontology is not well determined and defined.

494
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:46,720
And if we have this kind of, yeah, this position that we are clear about. And I think in this seminar

495
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:52,320
of this morning, we have very experienced people with not only PhD students, but people that are

496
00:54:53,040 --> 00:55:01,360
more experienced. Nevertheless, I would like to just make a comment. I arrived quite late to

497
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:08,240
critical realism. And I came also from a very practical space. I was a math teacher, which I'm

498
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:13,760
still, but I worked a lot in this kind of teaching environment with a more pragmatic approach to

499
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:21,920
what I was doing. And when I confronted myself with doing a PhD and thinking about ontology and

500
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:29,920
epistemology, I would say I think I didn't take it that seriously at the time, because I was ignorant

501
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:38,880
really. And I changed at a later stage, but I took a year to understand what is this ontology really

502
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:47,040
about. And once I have it clear, then I could do all the rest. And so I just want to say that,

503
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:55,200
yes, it is important to have a clear ontological stance and being aware of what are these implications.

504
00:55:55,840 --> 00:56:04,000
And I think with this, we've come to an end. And we go to our Q&A. I think it's great with

505
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:13,760
our time. And we have some questions here in the Q&A. So, yeah, any questions, I think,

506
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:18,560
from this, or shall we just, and yeah, someone was asking about a reference, and I just said

507
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:23,920
they are here in these slides. And we're going to put the link to the slides in the critical

508
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:34,320
realist network site at the end of today. So, yeah, there's so much going on in the chat.

509
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:42,240
Sorry, I was just trying to find my unmute button there. Yeah, just before we go to the Q&A,

510
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:47,200
I think we've picked up everything in the chat. If you've asked questions in the chat,

511
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:51,840
and we've not touched on them, please pop them into the Q&A. We'll make sure we get to all those

512
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:59,040
there. I just want to pick up on one other that was asked by Christopher, which is whether

513
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:08,480
objects have agency. And this depends on how we use the word objects. And I just want to say that

514
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:16,960
you will find the word objects and objective used in so many different ways in the literature

515
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:22,160
about ontology and epistemology. So, be very wary when you see that word and try and read

516
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:27,600
around it to understand what the author is saying. In my own kind of understanding, I would say that

517
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:35,360
yes, objects can have agency because we are both objects and agents. Our body has a physical

518
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:41,920
existence in the world that makes it an object that can kind of knock against things or we can

519
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:48,400
walk into things, etc. But also it has an internal existence that is able to think and

520
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:54,400
has a kind of unique creative capacity in the world to observe and

521
00:57:56,320 --> 00:58:02,720
to make change and to kind of accept or reject ideas, etc. So I would say that's one way in

522
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:10,560
which objects have agency. And then there's various kind of guess work about what other

523
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:17,120
objects have agency. We assume animals have agency to some extent as well and then I will

524
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:21,920
leave it up to your own imagination to see how much further you want to take that. Some people

525
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:26,880
might argue that society as a whole has some consciousness or agency. I'm not personally

526
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:31,920
convinced by that one, but that is a position that some people argue. And I suppose it's one of the

527
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:38,800
reasons that critical realism is often compatible with religious approaches, though I'm not myself

528
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:44,240
religious, other people within critical realism are. So that's quite a broad question. Answer to

529
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:48,480
your question, but hopefully that's helpful. Caroline, did you want to pick a question?

530
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:54,720
Yeah, I think a Hindi. I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing well the name, but I had a question that I

531
00:58:54,720 --> 00:59:01,200
asked. And again, him or her, I'm not sure if the name, because I'm not familiar with it, but

532
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:05,760
if you can put that question in the Q&A, because it was a question about structure and agency,

533
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:13,200
which I think is quite important, it's about how can social structure be applied, contextualized

534
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:19,040
at individual levels or the micro level in relation to human agency. So you're specifically

535
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:26,240
talking about structure and agency relationships at the individual level. And yeah, I just wanted

536
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:35,520
to say, I think the work of Margaret Archer is illustrative for this. She, her work on

537
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:42,240
reflexivity and the inner conversation, she has two books about that, the one of, yeah, I think

538
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:52,880
it's 2017, if I'm not wrong. But so she offers, and her, as well, I think her morphogenetic cycle

539
00:59:52,880 --> 01:00:00,000
really allows you to think about the agency and this kind of how your inner conversation

540
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:07,680
is something really important, because it's what mediates your agency. Now, I would suggest there

541
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:15,520
is another Paolo Donati, who has worked with her in the relational subject. And I think Donati has

542
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:22,240
a more social approach to reflexive engagement, what the inner conversation, there is a critique

543
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:28,880
that we don't talk only to ourselves, we talk with others. And the inner conversation is not,

544
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:34,320
it's not the only thing that mediates agency, there are other, other conversations, if you wish. So

545
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:40,560
I hope to answer that question, Kehinde, I think that will allow you to, to explore this, this

546
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:45,680
question deeper with Archer's work. Yeah. Thank you, Jack, for putting that reference there.

547
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:51,360
Can I just also say that I know there are a few people here who've read quite a lot of critical

548
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:56,960
realism. So I don't want this to be the case that Caroline and I, the experts and you guys are all

549
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:02,000
asking the questions. If you have any contributions to add to what we're saying, that would be great

550
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:11,680
too. So please raise a hand and jump into the, to the discussion. Okay, so shall we pick up

551
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:22,000
another question here. Question from Mateus, do the natural and social overlap,

552
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:28,640
some social structures maybe influenced by the natural? Yeah, absolutely. So I think one, one

553
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:36,240
way of thinking about this is in terms of emergence. So the idea that the social emerges from the

554
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:41,760
natural. And when we use that word emergence, we're not necessarily talking about over time

555
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:48,400
here. We're thinking in any particular moment, there is the natural world that includes our

556
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:56,640
bodies and human made objects, for example. But from that, that natural world of atoms and cells

557
01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:03,920
and biology emerges the social world of agency and thought and then social structures and ideas,

558
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:10,080
etc. So that would be one way in which they overlap that one emerges from the other. But then

559
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:15,440
thinking introducing time into the equation and thinking about this over time, we can say that

560
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:22,960
of course they interact constantly on, you know, a second by second basis, the natural and the

561
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:30,320
social world interacting. And I think exploring the interaction between them is a really important

562
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:35,360
kind of approach to social analysis. So yeah, really good question. Thanks. Please come in

563
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,960
and raise your hand if you want to add anything to that.

564
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:48,720
Christopher, I'm not sure, Jack, if you, if you did answer this question, because I'm not that great

565
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:53,680
at multitasking and hearing and reading at the same time. But I think it's a, it's a, it's a

566
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:59,280
question that is interesting. Can we distinguish the stratified levels of actual empirical and real

567
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:05,600
in data? So for example, interview data, document analysis, when doing qualitative research about

568
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:14,800
a particular social phenomenon, phenomena. So do you have any, any particular answer to this,

569
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:22,960
Jack, first to begin with? I, I, sorry, I was in the chat there. Just give me a moment. Yeah. So I

570
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:32,080
think in, in, I believe that this is our task as social researcher is to find the tools we need

571
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:40,800
to be able to, if the data does not allow us to go to that deeper level, which I think it doesn't

572
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:47,840
necessarily happen. So for example, if I, if I, if, if my entry point would be focus groups and I

573
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:54,160
do some discussion using a particular, you know, activity, and I want to trigger some conversations

574
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:59,120
about digital engagements, for example, with tools, how do you engage with what you engage, why you

575
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:09,040
engage, that data will only allow me to uncover this 10% the empirical level. If I want to go

576
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:15,760
deeper and explore these mechanisms that are there, I certainly need to put the theory in the

577
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:22,160
context of my research. Yes, I can't just say, you know, forget about my data and then go and look

578
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:30,400
for the theory that will allow me to identify which are the mechanisms that are responsible,

579
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:36,880
as we know, in an open system for these, for example, in my case, the lack of engagement.

580
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:45,040
Then I think you need to, with that in mind and your data, you need to go to the theory.

581
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:50,560
And there is where that combination, your experience as a practitioner in the field,

582
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:56,000
and having read quite a bit about the structures that you're exploring, I think you put them

583
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:01,600
together, but not necessarily the data allows you per se to go deeper into those levels. That's

584
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:07,200
how I see it. I'm not sure if there is another, and again, as Jack said, if anyone in the audience

585
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:15,360
would like to chip in, we're happy to do that because, yeah, that's kind of, yeah, my experience with it.

586
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:27,600
Okay, so I'm reading some of these questions. Yeah, I'm just just looking at the questions

587
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:35,440
to think of which one to answer. Maria is saying here, how do we know that we are actually unpacking

588
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:43,680
real as that unpacking is dependent on our perceptions? And this is a question I asked

589
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:52,160
myself a year and a half and every day, you know, how do I know that what I'm doing is real?

590
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:58,800
And yeah, Jack, if you want to jump into that one. Yeah. And so two thoughts on that one.

591
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:05,440
The first would be perhaps a bit of an unsatisfactory answer, but would be to say that critical

592
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:10,000
realism does insist on the fallibility of knowledge. I think I mentioned this to someone

593
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:17,200
in the chat earlier that critical realism is not offering kind of 100% certainty

594
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:22,080
in everything it does. Rather, it's trying to find the most compelling and convincing

595
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:33,680
understanding of reality using introspection and logic and as well as kind of our existing theories

596
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:38,960
and empirical understandings of the world. So it's trying to build the most compelling case

597
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:46,640
on the basis of that. On the other hand, perhaps, or hopefully giving a slightly more convincing

598
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:56,800
or slightly more satisfactory answer, hopefully, is that I think if we look at Baskar's argument

599
01:06:56,800 --> 01:07:03,520
that there are underlying causal mechanisms in reality, I think there is, I personally find that

600
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:10,480
quite compelling because he asks what, how does the world have to be for us to kind of experience

601
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:15,760
it this way? How does the world have to be for science to be possible? He argues. So I would say

602
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:21,840
that although there are those skeptical challenges we were talking about earlier,

603
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:28,880
there is a degree of security we can have in our beliefs, even if we can't have certainty,

604
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:32,720
because our experiences of the world, especially when we talk to others and they have similar

605
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:39,920
experiences, do help us see or help us kind of follow the logic that Baskar's arguing.

606
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:46,400
Yeah, not a fully satisfactory answer, I'm aware, but hopefully that helps and I'd be interested

607
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:54,720
to hear other thoughts on that too. Yes, I think it's, yeah, it's not, and again,

608
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:58,560
you know, I don't think, I think the fallibility is something really important here and that's

609
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:02,560
going to happen. The epistemology you're going to, in the next seminar, you're going to explore that

610
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:11,280
deeper. But that's, I think that is an important part of the answer. Just picking another question

611
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:20,160
from the Q&A, which is again, this is quite blurry, but the question is quite interesting

612
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:25,920
regarding objects of study. The motto, don't go looking for something that doesn't exist,

613
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:32,560
seems sensible, but what about concepts that are intensely contested, or that many people

614
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:39,360
would question the basis of? And I think here, critical realism is interesting to work with

615
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:50,320
contested ideas. Are they real? Are they not real? And I would say this is kind of

616
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:57,920
reducing, again, the complexity of this philosophy of science, making a reduction in this instant

617
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:04,320
that I'm talking to you, which means this is not the only answer to this. But I think there is this

618
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:10,240
question, is it real? And if it's real, then I will study it using critical realism. Again, I'm in

619
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:17,120
this philosophy of science. So if it's not real, then I need to go for what is then the real aspect

620
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:22,640
of this phenomenon that I'm investigating. I think that's how I would approach this. And myself,

621
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:29,600
I'm looking at datafication as a phenomenon. Is it real? And why is it real? It's very contested.

622
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:39,280
What is it? What is it not? So I think, yeah, you know, and the basis of the real, again,

623
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:49,040
what you can say about is not definite, is not uncriticisable or academically,

624
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:55,200
you can always critique it and find a better explanation where you can say, well, you know

625
01:09:55,200 --> 01:10:01,840
what, I think this is not real because that I'm here, I'm offering maybe this aspect of it

626
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:05,040
is real. And that's why it is, I think that is the way to go.

627
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:17,360
Thanks. And can I just pick up on the question from Gonzague and apologies by mispronouncing that.

628
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:23,360
Why do social researchers still not use critical realism in their inquiries?

629
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:31,280
What likely explanations could you provide on this issue? So it's difficult to kind of explain

630
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:36,800
why others aren't using your theory. I think that's always a problem with any kind of belief,

631
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:43,600
but just to share a couple of thoughts on that. One would be from my own discipline,

632
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:49,120
political science at least, and I'm sure it applies to others, that there isn't as much

633
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:56,720
critical reflection about our underlying ontologies and epistemologies as there should be.

634
01:10:56,720 --> 01:11:01,920
It's something that lots of us learn at master's or PhD level. And then when lots of social

635
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:07,760
scientists go out to conduct research, the pressures of the academic world, perhaps,

636
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:12,960
and lots of other reasons might mean that they focus a lot less on their underlying ontology

637
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:18,720
and epistemology. So there is a kind of general lack of criticality that we could think about.

638
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:23,440
That would be one side of the explanation. And I think the other side of the explanation comes

639
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:30,400
from the influentialness of post-structuralism, and particularly the work of Foucault and others,

640
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:37,520
and those who have built on Foucault's work, who rejects the idea that the world contains

641
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:44,640
objects with essences, who reject the idea that the world contains structures, and instead

642
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:52,240
emphasise the fluidity and contingency of the world to the extent that there are no

643
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:57,440
entities within it. And I think there are lots of problems with that philosophical approach.

644
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:04,800
It's been very influential via Foucault and Judith Butler and others. I would personally

645
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:08,800
disagree with it, but I think that's one of the reasons that critical realism isn't more widely

646
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:13,840
used, because those who do reflect on their ontology and epistemology are often taking

647
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:19,200
this alternative post-structurist approach. So I think for those engaging with critical

648
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:24,960
realism as a theory in their thesis or research, that debate between critical realism and

649
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:30,800
post-structuralism I think is very helpful in outlining and defending a critical realist approach.

650
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:40,400
Yeah, and Stephen is saying that his supervisor says it's a cult, and I'm reminded by Ben Mansky,

651
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:48,240
who is part of the group of people organising the seminar, saying that in the United States,

652
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:54,800
where he is working, it's the same thing. It is something that is very, very much criticised as

653
01:12:54,800 --> 01:13:01,360
a cult. And you know, again, I think there is really here, for me, my experience at least,

654
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:08,160
it needs to catch you. It needs to really ring a bell when you're doing your research. You just

655
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:14,000
kind of say, wow, this really is what I was looking for. This allows me to explain the

656
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:20,320
unexplainable until I got this, this kind of this philosophical approach to social science.

657
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:28,000
So I think also you need to really be, you're always going to be uncomfortable because I think

658
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:32,320
that is really what knowledge generates in us when we are creating this thing that we really

659
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:37,280
don't know. We're in this kind of really space where we don't know. But I think critical realism,

660
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:43,280
you know, it can be for different people, different things. And don't let yourself,

661
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:50,960
how do you say be deterred from using it? Because everyone, you know, they're people that defend,

662
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:59,120
you know, let's say new materialism, which has been a new, which also has a part of realism,

663
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:06,400
because Barat talks about agential realism. But there are, you know, there are people critiquing

664
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:13,840
this fiercely, others taking it and writing books. And so it's really, I think, what you,

665
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:20,480
your hunch, your inner investigator voice, what is it saying to you? And then you go

666
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:24,720
and explore it deep and you will be able to answer questions and, you know, and argue for

667
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:29,280
your position. It's not an easy one. Yeah, go for it.

668
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:30,480
Sorry, Caroline, after you.

669
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:31,520
No, go ahead, go ahead.

670
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:37,680
Yeah, I just wanted to come in and add to that, which is, as I said earlier, that quite a lot

671
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:45,440
of people who use critical realism also hold religious positions. And although I don't myself,

672
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:52,240
I'm personally an atheist. I think that often puts people off and people almost take the attitude

673
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:58,160
that religion doesn't have a place in social theory. But I would suggest that if you're religious,

674
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:03,520
then religion does have a place in social theory, because it is about your ontology

675
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:08,160
and how you understand the world to be. And we should be making that explicit and debating

676
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:14,480
and discussing it rather than trying to keep it separate. So that's one point. And I think the

677
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:22,160
other is that maybe some critical realist texts focus too much on only the critical realist tools

678
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:28,320
of understanding, whereas actually, I think the majority of those using critical realism

679
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:34,640
are exploring it in relation to other social theories, in relation to other social ontologies,

680
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:39,280
they're engaging at those boundaries and building those bridges. And I think that's where the really

681
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:46,480
interesting work is being done. So yes, that would be some thoughts on that question. And I just

682
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:51,760
want to very briefly say something that a few times in the chat, people have been talking about

683
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:56,880
abduction and retroduction. If those words are confusing you, we will come back to those in

684
01:15:56,880 --> 01:16:03,040
future sessions. I'm sure that'll be picked up in the methodology, perhaps the epistemology

685
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:07,120
session and perhaps others as well. So we shall come back to those issues.

686
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:16,160
Yeah. And you know, I think social science is contested and that's the beauty of it.

687
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:21,520
And that's the richness as well. And I think the religion example is brilliant because I'm

688
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:28,560
myself an agnostic as well. And when I started to read about it, I really was puzzled with it.

689
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:37,360
And I was saying, you know, it stopped me in the sense of it made me read with more care.

690
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:43,440
And it made me read more to say, okay, let me see if this is really aligned with my ontology of the

691
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:53,760
world. But I think it's our position that we need to be able to defend it in our, if you're doing

692
01:16:53,760 --> 01:17:05,360
your PhD in your Viva. I, for example, in mine, had quite hard questions to answer. But I knew it

693
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:11,440
because I really didn't understand anything about it when I started. And I think that is the important

694
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:16,560
thing. It doesn't matter if the people that are evaluating your thesis believe in it or not,

695
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:22,320
I think what is important, if you have been so coherent that you are arguing your methodology,

696
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:28,160
your explanation, your findings, the way in which you look at social change, non deterministic,

697
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:32,960
all of that, if that is in line, you'll be able to defend it. And is it that you're doing a research

698
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:37,040
project or your PhD, or you're doing something as a professional researcher, it doesn't matter,

699
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:41,680
but you will be able to, you know, to make a sound case. I think that that is key.

700
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:51,120
Excellent. I think we have answered the questions in the Q&A as far as I see it. But

701
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:55,680
I'd be very keen for people to raise their hands if they want to come in with

702
01:17:55,680 --> 01:18:00,640
comments or other questions. We have eight minutes left. So if you do want to have other

703
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:05,360
comments you'd like to make or questions you'd like to ask, please type them in or raise your hand

704
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:10,480
and come in on the mic. It would be great to hear from some of you if there are any other

705
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:14,800
thoughts. We'll just give a minute or two to see if anything else comes in before we wrap up.

706
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:23,360
Yeah, Thanos, I think your comment is really to the point. So your supervisor said you're crazy

707
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:31,120
and at the end it's a great thesis. I think it allows really to make, because it is really,

708
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:34,880
you have to read to understand, you have to really go into it. It really allows it to

709
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:41,440
make a sound work. I think it was my case as well. And maybe just one other thing on that is that

710
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:48,080
it doesn't necessarily have to be the case that to use critical realism, you read everything that

711
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:54,560
is written by critical realists and mobilise it all as some kind of gigantic structure.

712
01:18:54,560 --> 01:19:00,160
I think it's fine for you to be pulling out key ideas or key concepts that you find particularly

713
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:05,600
useful. As long as you're paying attention to ensure that there aren't key contradictions between

714
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:10,960
that and other parts of your theory, then it's okay to take parts from critical realism and

715
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:15,760
include that in your research. I don't think we should be concerned about whether you're

716
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:22,800
applying critical realism as a whole or not. And there our other sessions are going to be great.

717
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:28,160
I think the last one talks about the framework and how you then are able to include in your

718
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:35,040
scaffold structure these theories that make sense to your work. And there are people trying to build

719
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:40,400
bridges between one thing and the other, Frederick van den Berger being one of them. So there is a

720
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:46,960
lot of work going on in the social science and how can we communicate different maybe ways of

721
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:51,040
looking at the world who's using critical realism and the strength it offers.

722
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:58,160
Yeah, just another question or comment from Christopher about the relationship between

723
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:04,640
Paulson and Tilly's realist evaluation and the kind of more bascarian critical realist tradition.

724
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:09,600
So despite coming from the University of Leeds as both a Masters and PhD student,

725
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:13,680
I'm not that familiar with Paulson and Tilly. I have read realist evaluation,

726
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:20,720
but I'm not that familiar with their work or its influence. But I would say there's an interesting

727
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:27,200
divide really that is that there's a kind of blurred boundary there. There is an International

728
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:32,640
Association of Critical Realism Conference, and there is a realist evaluation conference.

729
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:38,400
So on the face of it, they look separate, but actually you'll find people using both at different

730
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:45,360
each conference, and you'll find people trying to overlap them in various ways.

731
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:54,320
I think they're basically different frameworks for social analysis that broadly accept some of the

732
01:20:54,320 --> 01:21:01,040
same ontological positions would be a way of understanding it. Perhaps like I said,

733
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:04,880
I don't have the knowledge to go into a huge amount of depth about the precise differences

734
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:10,960
between them. But just as a more general comment is that Paulson and Tilly's realist evaluation

735
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:20,800
tends to be more widely and easily applied to policy and to more empirical research, and Bascar's

736
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:29,280
work tends to be more theoretically elaborate or in-depth, but is more a challenge to apply,

737
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:34,000
as some of you probably discovered. But hopefully the rest of the sessions in the series will

738
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:38,960
make that a little easier. Yeah, and that realist evaluation, I think what it really does, it

739
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:46,560
it uses these kind of concepts of generative mechanisms, the outcomes, and the context. I

740
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:52,240
think it does really use that, but then they use it in the way that is useful for them.

741
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:58,080
But I think they're, again, I don't know a lot, but I read two papers when I was trying to put

742
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:04,640
these causal pathways together from my own work, and it was illustrative in the sense of how do

743
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:12,640
you make your causal pathways? If you're explaining something, where are these mechanisms

744
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:19,040
really interacting and producing the outcome that I can see? It is helpful, but yeah, we don't need

745
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:27,280
to take things like lots of activity going in the chat, which is great.

746
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:36,000
Just to say that there's been one of the questions about when the realist evaluation

747
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:40,800
conference is. I don't know, but here's a website that should take you to the

748
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:46,640
details of the last conference, and hopefully through there you'll be able to find information

749
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:47,600
about the next one.

750
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:57,840
Yeah, and thank you for sharing your resources, which are quite useful as well,

751
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:02,800
so thank you for that. It enriches the space.

752
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:12,000
So I think without any further questions, I think we can draw the session to a close here.

753
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,800
I just want to say a huge thank you to everyone who's asked questions and contributed in the

754
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:21,840
chat. There's been absolutely loads going on there and loads of great exchanges of ideas,

755
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:28,240
and thank you all for attending. Make sure you come along to the next session on epistemology

756
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:33,680
and to follow the whole course through to the end, and we'd really appreciate your feedback

757
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:39,680
as well, so please drop us an email or get in touch with feedback and use the forums that

758
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:45,360
are on the Critical Realist Network website to ask questions and take the discussion forward as well.

759
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:52,400
Yes, thank you very much. It was a pleasure, and it's always so much that one learns being

760
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:56,400
in these spaces, so I'm grateful for your being here.
