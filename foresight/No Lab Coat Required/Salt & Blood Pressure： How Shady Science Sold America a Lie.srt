1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,400
Okay, so, what do you think?

2
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,560
It's salt.

3
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,560
But you and I both know it's more than that.

4
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,720
I mean, we could get into the technical size, but you just got here.

5
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,120
We'll do that later.

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,200
I'm more concerned about what you actually think.

7
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,600
Remember that recommendation to cut salt.

8
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,600
Salt.

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,600
Salt.

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,600
It has to be America's favorite flavoring.

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,360
You might say the extra ingredient is salt.

12
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,360
Put it in your medical study.

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,360
New study.

14
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,360
New study.

15
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,240
Recent study is shiny light on the amount of sodium Americans eat.

16
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,240
Slash salt.

17
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,240
Easier said than done.

18
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,040
This is one of those medical stories that people get confused about.

19
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,360
Number one risk for a diet-related death sodium.

20
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,280
Do you know the origin of your thoughts on salt?

21
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,280
For some of us, yes.

22
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,240
For the rest of us, think about it.

23
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,400
Think about your thoughts.

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,400
Thought-ception.

25
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,640
Because what if I told you what you believe or don't believe about salt was influenced

26
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,080
by something you never even considered?

27
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,080
Look around.

28
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,080
A standard American diet.

29
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,800
We didn't just wake up like this.

30
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:25,040
The research behind the food is how we ended up like this.

31
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,640
Welcome to No Lab Corp require.

32
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:35,560
My name is Johnny Cole Dixon and I swear we won't do the entire video like this.

33
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,560
Sodium has a reputation.

34
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,680
More accurately, it has an association.

35
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:44,560
How many times have you heard, I'm limiting my salt, I'm watching over my blood pressure?

36
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,280
Right now is probably the best time to mention that sodium and salt are not the same thing.

37
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,480
We get the two mixed up and it's perfectly fine.

38
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,480
It's okay.

39
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,480
It happens.

40
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,320
Even in the sacred world of academia, I've seen a research paper making this mistake.

41
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,760
Sodium is an ingredient of salt.

42
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,800
If you take a pinch of salt, only 40% is sodium.

43
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,840
The rest of it is chloride.

44
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,840
The other ingredient needed to make salt.

45
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,840
Okay.

46
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,840
Editing Johnny here.

47
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,840
I know.

48
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,840
Back to back interruptions.

49
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,840
That's crazy.

50
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,240
But now is probably also the best time to mention that I want this to be relevant for you.

51
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,880
So we're talking about blood pressure, but why does this matter?

52
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,120
Well, blood pressure is what we know as a precursor, meaning it comes before the main

53
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,120
thing.

54
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,920
The only thing we really want to avoid is the number one disease in the world, heart

55
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,760
disease or cardiovascular disease, some form of fashion, just like if you wanted to graduate

56
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,040
top of your class, that doesn't just happen.

57
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,320
There has to be a precursor.

58
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,080
Something has to take place prior.

59
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,080
What will have to take place?

60
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,200
You'd have to study a lot.

61
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,280
Salt and blood pressure.

62
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,200
Where did this association come from?

63
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,200
Is it valid or invalid?

64
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,340
How does this work in the body physically speaking?

65
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,640
How much sodium do I need?

66
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,640
So many questions.

67
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,640
Adventure awaits.

68
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,640
Let's hop in.

69
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,760
Self-organization put out a publication in March of 2023, a big old document on sodium

70
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,520
intake reduction.

71
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,720
Because as they state, the evidence is clear.

72
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,840
The more sodium we consume, the more our blood pressure rises and blood pressure is reduced

73
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,680
when dietary sodium intake is reduced.

74
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,800
Reducing sodium intake is one of the most cost effective ways to improve health.

75
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,800
Dang.

76
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,800
Poor sodium.

77
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,880
It ain't got a lot going for it right now.

78
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,320
So according to the WHO, the answer is as straightforward as an error.

79
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,800
Real quick, because I brought up the WHO, it always seems that health communicators are

80
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,960
at odds with these big entities, right?

81
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,720
WHO, FDA, USDA.

82
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,240
It must be because they're corrupted and want to profit off of everything with two

83
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,920
legs.

84
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,920
Not entirely.

85
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,920
Look at it this way.

86
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,920
Just entertain this with me.

87
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,720
Let's say you're getting a lecture from Professor Johnny about the sun.

88
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,280
Professor Johnny says the sun is great for plants, not for humans.

89
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,000
Put sunscreen on and stay in the shade if you know what's good for you.

90
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,520
You go to a different lecture where a separate professor, Professor Cole Dixon, is talking

91
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,920
about the sun as well, but his presentation is different.

92
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,880
He talks about the different rays the sun provides, vitamin D, melanin production, the

93
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,440
spectrum of extreme sun exposure to being a vampire.

94
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,360
What's the difference between these two professors?

95
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,360
Nuance.

96
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,040
You see, a lack of nuance raises three flags against a communicator.

97
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,640
Flag one, it seems they've ignored the blatantly obvious contrarian evidence.

98
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,240
Flag two, they're one-sided points just reek of bias.

99
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,880
Flag three, which is really just a result of flag one and two, is that they look like

100
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,200
they have an ulterior motive.

101
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:32,320
And turns out Professor Johnny was a sunscreen dealer, CEO of Sunny Johnny's sunscreen

102
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,320
enterprises.

103
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,560
Okay, let's go back to that WHO passage and highlight something.

104
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,000
The more sodium we consume, the more our blood pressure rises.

105
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
That's the messaging.

106
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
How do we get here?

107
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Let's find out.

108
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,600
1904, where it all began.

109
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,240
This was the first study to report a positive correlation between salt intake and blood

110
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:00,080
pressure in humans.

111
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,800
Two French researchers gathered six patients and noticed an increase in salt intake was

112
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,520
associated with a rise of blood pressure.

113
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,320
Interestingly, the researchers also observed that some of the patient's blood pressure

114
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,880
barely budged after massive salt intake.

115
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:18,040
And the researchers wondered, perhaps there's an internal factor that modulates the blood

116
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,840
pressure from one person to another.

117
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,680
Possibly, what made these two groups have totally separate responses to high salt intake?

118
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,680
We'll get to this later.

119
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,680
This was a novel finding.

120
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,160
The French researchers were going to advance their field greatly from this one discovery.

121
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,400
But they were rebutted only three years later by a German researcher who opposed the findings

122
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,400
of the French.

123
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,560
He was skeptical of the salt blood pressure relationship.

124
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,200
He called out his French peers as wrong and labeled their experimentation as flawed.

125
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:50,560
There it was in early 1900s in black and white, two opposite findings, two opposing sides,

126
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,200
the pioneers and the skeptics.

127
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,960
Sounds like a good baseball game.

128
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,960
This is when the salty saga, the great debate, officially began.

129
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,760
You're given the options when you grocery shop.

130
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:07,520
You can get the regular item or you can get the item's low sodium cousin.

131
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,120
People read something like low sodium, light or less salt.

132
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,800
When food companies take an ingredient out, it's usually something we've all agreed

133
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,280
upon is generally not great for humans, right?

134
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,960
Like high fructose corn syrup.

135
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,280
But salt, as this academic commentary states, is the only essential component of mammals

136
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,000
to have obtained an unattractive status.

137
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,960
The world salt may have found its footing in the early 1900s, but it wasn't until 1960

138
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:37,120
when a man hailing from Long Island, New York, by the name Louis Kitchener Dahl, made everybody

139
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,280
pick a side.

140
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,280
Two studies.

141
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,240
Dahl published two studies, one in 1960 and one in 1962, which is like back to back in

142
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,200
scientific standards, two back to back albums, holding it down from the 60 to the 62.

143
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,800
These two studies are what many consider to be the seminal point.

144
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,120
This is when the salty saga really started to heat up.

145
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,200
Study number one, Dahl had been doing some observational work with salt intake and populations.

146
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,920
He traveled around the world with a small elite task force to perform a duty of the

147
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,000
utmost importance, collecting pee.

148
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,080
That's right, the 24 hour pee test is the gold standard for measuring a person's sodium

149
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,080
intake levels.

150
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,440
Over 90% of sodium is excreted through the kidney.

151
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,320
Considering you're healthy and didn't just come off of a mean game of Batman or an intense

152
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:23,480
game of chess, anything you'd sweat significantly because a collection of the last 24 hours

153
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,360
of your urine says a lot about where your sodium is at.

154
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,000
Dahl and his team collected data from the US, northern Japan, southern Japan, Marshall

155
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,480
Islanders, which is somewhere in the middle of the ocean, and finally Alaska.

156
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,120
The Alaskans average less than four grams of salt consumption, the Marshall Islanders

157
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,120
about seven grams, the Americans about 10, the southern Japanese 14, and the northern

158
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,280
Japanese 26 grams.

159
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,880
He then measured up these folks salt intake against the prevalence of high blood pressure,

160
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,080
which he indicated as 140 over 90.

161
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,080
I'm in an extremely uncomfortable position before we get into Dahl's results for my

162
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,800
folks who could use a little bit more insight on blood pressure.

163
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,840
The measurement of blood pressure is expressed by two numbers called systolic and diastolic.

164
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,280
Okay, sweet beans, what are the numbers actually telling us?

165
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,480
So when our blood travels throughout the body, it's being pressed up against the walls

166
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,480
of our blood vessels.

167
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,800
And I know that sounds a little violent, but our blood vessels are perfectly capable

168
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,800
of handling this.

169
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,400
When the heart is actively pumping blood, we get systolic pressure, the high number because

170
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,840
our blood just zoomed.

171
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,960
And between heartbeats, the heart's relaxed and we get diastolic pressure, the lower

172
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,360
number when the blood isn't zooming as much.

173
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:27,320
This is the only place where you can define blood pressure with the word zooming.

174
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,320
Stay in school.

175
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,000
Dahl's results, we get them in 1960 and you guessed it.

176
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,800
A near perfect correlation between sodium intake and prevalence of hypertension.

177
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,320
The more solid you ate, the higher your blood pressure.

178
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:44,200
Now Dahl's science here wasn't perfect and in fact to some it was considered negligible.

179
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,920
As this commentary states, there were no details given concerning the measures if any that

180
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,520
were used to avoid confounding and bias.

181
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,080
Now this is a really big deal and we actually have to talk about this.

182
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,520
A confounding factor is a variable that sneakily influences the outcome you're measuring.

183
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,160
We can stick with the topic on hand.

184
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:06,880
If we're measuring sodium and hypertension, a.k.a. chronically elevated blood pressure,

185
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,320
what are some things other than sodium that may contribute to that?

186
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,800
Well, we got stress, physical inactivity and we got age.

187
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,000
These would be our confounding factors.

188
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,560
Without proper action to account for these potential confounding factors influencing

189
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,320
our results, we end up with a inflated conclusion.

190
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:28,040
And if you're super slimy, you ignore confounding on purpose to give yourself leeway to say

191
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,840
there's a relationship between two things.

192
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,560
It's the difference between rolling a strike with the kitty railing up versus the kitty

193
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,560
railing down.

194
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,080
A kid may think his accuracy is all that, but he didn't account for the fact that the

195
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,920
kitty railing greatly influenced his outcome.

196
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,400
He would have been guttering it up.

197
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,400
It's based on a true story.

198
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,400
I was a kid.

199
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,360
Now we can pick apart Dahl's research all day and there's been plenty of old researches

200
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,440
to do just that.

201
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:56,040
But this first study wasn't important because of its findings, but because it showed Dahl's

202
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,520
beliefs about salt.

203
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,760
You see, Dahl's paper plainly revealed what side of the fence he was on when it came

204
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:05,160
to salt, categorizing it as a subtle lethal agent and putting it in the same light as

205
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,720
fallout and carcinogens, later comparing it to fat, cigarettes, and alcohol.

206
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,540
This was essentially Dahl's entry into the conversation, right?

207
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:18,400
This was Dahl arriving at the pool party, but this next study, the 1962 one, was like

208
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:24,480
him jumping into the pool, cannonballing and splashing everybody.

209
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,480
How'd you like that one?

210
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,520
Uh, I was not following.

211
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,320
Sounded pretty descriptive though.

212
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,040
Study number two, Dahl's 1962 study.

213
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,280
This would be the one to effectively change the way Americans ate.

214
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,740
Before we get into that, I did want to say that I thought I had a solid understanding

215
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:46,520
of how big of a deal this salt thing was.

216
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:51,800
Usually my research phase for a video can last anywhere from two days to two weeks.

217
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,920
This took much longer than that.

218
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,800
But rummaging through all of these old, salty research papers, I started to understand how

219
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,680
big of a deal this was when I came across this.

220
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,920
The Political Science of Salt.

221
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,680
Written by Gary Tovs, it illustrates the territory we're about to embark on.

222
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:13,560
The salt controversy constitutes one of the longest running, most vitriolic, and surreal

223
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,680
disputes in all of medicine.

224
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,200
On the one side are those experts who insist that the evidence that salt raises blood pressure

225
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,240
is effectively irrefutable.

226
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,960
On the other side are those researchers who argue that the data supporting universal salt

227
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,400
reduction have never been compelling.

228
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,040
You see, I wanted this video to be like flipping a coin, right?

229
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,320
We all just want one answer.

230
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,320
Believe me, I know.

231
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,920
How cautious, if at all, do we have to be over our salt intake?

232
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,400
Is that too much to ask?

233
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,560
It shouldn't be, but it is.

234
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,560
Why is that?

235
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,160
Well, there's two reasons.

236
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,760
One, we'll get to later.

237
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,760
It's scientific.

238
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,800
But this one, it's about ideology.

239
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,920
You see, the study that opened up the salt saga in 1904 was monumental because of new

240
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,120
revelation.

241
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,800
We learned that salt may have something to do with blood pressure.

242
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:02,360
As time passed, hypertension quickly became an area of high focus because it was recognized

243
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,680
as a precursor to the number one disease in the world, heart disease.

244
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,400
So many studies were done.

245
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,400
Money was poured in.

246
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,680
Resources were poured in.

247
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,200
We need answers.

248
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,200
And guess what?

249
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,200
We got them.

250
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:19,320
We started off so dang tribal about salt that it became less about the science and discovering

251
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,960
truth and more about picking a side.

252
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:27,080
The moment we pick a side is the moment we engage with science's greatest enemy, and

253
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,160
that is confirmation bias.

254
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,440
The mind under the veil of confirmation bias is so fascinating.

255
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,880
We become so fixated on the thing that we believe or are convinced of that we will go

256
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,760
to any length to prove that we're right, usually to ourselves.

257
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,480
Back with any evidence that says otherwise, it's either black or it's white.

258
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,760
There's no room for gray.

259
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,520
And ignoring nuance affords us the luxury of being right.

260
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,800
Bias can come from an agenda or it can come from straight up ego.

261
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,880
Either way, we've made an absolute mess.

262
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:03,080
Every government entity, every health communicator, every salty researcher has staked their position

263
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,680
and gave guidelines.

264
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:09,520
Either one, two, three, four, five, six or seven or eight grams of salt a day without

265
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,360
regarding the nuance.

266
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,320
And when we go deeper into the science in a bit here, we'll understand why this is

267
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,200
such a huge mistake we've been making.

268
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,920
So back to the Lewis Kitchener doll study of 1962, study number two.

269
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,920
What do we got?

270
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,920
We got rats.

271
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,920
Varmit.

272
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,920
Rodents.

273
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,200
Just, it's just rats.

274
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,760
Doll took 47 lab rats, just about half male and half female.

275
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:35,440
They were put on an 11.6% seesaw chow over the course of four weeks.

276
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,640
Observe something interesting.

277
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,120
Some rats were developing elevated blood pressure.

278
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,120
Some rats weren't.

279
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,760
The Zynga, he then went on a selective breeding spree.

280
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,240
Rats with the highest blood pressures were bred together and those with the lowest pressures

281
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,240
were bred together.

282
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,160
The kids of the high blood pressure parents were put on the same salty regimen and those

283
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,280
of them that developed the highest blood pressures were then bred again.

284
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,520
The rest were sent to lab rat heaven.

285
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,680
And then of course on the flip side, the same went for the kids of the low blood pressure

286
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,680
rats.

287
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,360
Can you call it offspring of rats kids?

288
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,720
Doll ended up with three generations of two separate groups of rats.

289
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,120
Those that responded to the salt regimen with a relatively high blood pressure and those

290
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,840
that responded with a relatively low blood pressure.

291
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:17,840
And holy smokes, Doll jumped up, slapped his desk, yelled Eureka and brought around for

292
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,840
all of his colleagues because he knew he was on to something.

293
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:26,560
I mean, there's no evidence he actually did that, but good imagine.

294
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,960
His rats that responded with high blood pressure from excess salt were coin salt sensitive.

295
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,720
His rats that responded with low blood pressures were coin salt resistant.

296
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,240
The results were published and it made absolute waves.

297
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,160
I mean, as much as a scientific white paper could make, am I right?

298
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:48,040
But the paper was so big and so impactful because it established the idea of salt sensitivity.

299
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,040
Let's break down salt sensitivity, but first you're probably wondering if Doll's 1962

300
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,960
study was better than his 1961 study.

301
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,240
Let it be known that there has never been a single research paper published that did

302
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,240
not undergo criticism.

303
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,920
I mean, the world of academia is absolutely cutthroat, but for some reason when it comes

304
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:07,360
to salt, it's cutthroat, ear, arm and leg.

305
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,360
But 1962, that study published by Doll was actually pretty good.

306
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:17,720
I mean, there was one sly researcher who pointed out an absolutely massive issue with the study.

307
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:23,360
We're going to talk about this in a bit, but the structure and the way the study was performed

308
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,120
was undeniably good.

309
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,320
Salt sensitivity, the idea that we can inherit our blood pressure response to salt, as Doll

310
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,640
put it, is about a genetically transmitted sensitivity to salt.

311
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,760
What he observed was that the strain most prone to develop hypertension from salt did

312
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,440
not develop hypertension when excess dietary salt was emitted.

313
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,520
If you're anything like me, you're probably a little confused.

314
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,520
Think of it this way.

315
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:49,600
If my parents were Serena Williams and LeBron James, actually they're both happily married

316
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
with kids.

317
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:56,720
If I had two stellar athlete parents, I would have a predisposition to excel at sports.

318
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:03,000
But if I was never exposed to a single basketball tennis racket or hockey stick, I would never

319
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,920
have the chance to develop those athlete stellar skills.

320
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,880
In the same way, the offspring of the high blood pressure rats never developed high

321
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,840
blood pressure because they were never exposed to excess salt.

322
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:20,520
Okay, now how well does Doll study and the concept of salt sensitivity translate to the

323
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,520
real world?

324
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:27,840
Doll was working with lab rats in a controlled environment where mating was precisely calculated.

325
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:33,600
Humans don't live in that kind of world, so of course this isn't an exact translation.

326
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,360
In fact, far from it because humans are really just that genetically complex.

327
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,680
Now a quick search up on Dr. Google and you'll come across some entities settling on salt

328
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:50,160
sensitivity as the resolution of salt's relationship with blood pressure.

329
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,200
For example, the National Heart, Long and Blood Institute make mention of salt sensitivity

330
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,320
in their Causes and Risk Factors article.

331
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:02,040
Okay, now the concept of salt sensitivity is okay, it makes sense, but one of its biggest

332
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,040
thoughts is that it is impossible to measure.

333
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:12,840
There is no consensus on the defining lines that make an individual salt sensitive.

334
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:16,920
These researchers put it best, both the amount of salt administered and the magnitude of

335
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:22,560
the response above which pressure is considered to be salt sensitive vary enormously among

336
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,560
studies.

337
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,520
So basically scientists have been experimenting with the idea of salt sensitivity, but they're

338
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:31,480
all using different amounts of salt and different salt sensitive thresholds.

339
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,240
Like when is a person salt sensitive after they take in this much salt and their blood

340
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,840
pressure rises this much or after they take in this much salt and their blood pressure

341
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,000
rises this much?

342
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,040
We can imagine this just opens up the world of conflicting data as each study is able

343
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,360
to move the goalpost to how they see fit.

344
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:54,240
Okay, now let's get to the Sly researcher who pointed out the massive issue with Dahl's

345
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,200
1962 lab rat study.

346
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,560
His name was F. O. Simpson.

347
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:02,280
I'm not excited to say how many research papers I looked through to find this man's

348
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,600
first name, but I do know his middle name is Olaf.

349
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:11,080
He's often cited for pointing out that the amount of salt that Dahl gave those rats was

350
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,600
simply enormous.

351
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,640
According to Simpson's calculations, if you translate the amount of salt consumed by

352
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:22,880
the rats and you make it relative to a 150-ish pound man, that man would be ingesting 560

353
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,760
grams of salt a day.

354
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,800
That's like knocking back 75% of an umbrella girl's salt container a day.

355
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,720
That's over 215,000 milligrams of sodium.

356
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,840
Now I did some more rodent research to find out if his calculations were accurate and

357
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,640
from what I can judge, his formula was a little inflated, so I cut it in half.

358
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,360
And obviously we're still talking about a ridiculous amount of salt at 280 grams of

359
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,720
salt or 107,000 milligrams of sodium.

360
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,860
So Dahl's 1962 lab rat study, on the one hand, it says a lot about the power of genetics.

361
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:56,440
On the other hand, in order to achieve hypertension in those rats, he gave them just flat-out

362
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,600
boo-cool loads of salt, unrealistic to the amount any human would ever consume.

363
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:07,480
So the study has a twang of deep value and a few sprinkles of irrelevance.

364
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,480
What do you make of it?

365
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,040
It doesn't matter because Dahl and his rats quickly became the salt reduction champions

366
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,400
of the United States.

367
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,840
If you're talking salt and hypertension, you're talking Lewis, Kitchener, Dahl.

368
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,880
He quickly became the front-running scientist for limiting salt.

369
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,120
His influence started to reach beyond just the scientific community, now the government

370
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,120
is getting involved.

371
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:35,440
1969, the White House had its first meeting to talk about reducing salt for the nation.

372
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,200
And in 1972, the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute sponsored the National Blood

373
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,960
Pressure Education campaign, the first campaign.

374
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,480
America is starting to get the message, and this campaign did not come out of nowhere.

375
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,200
Just earlier, in the same year, Dahl released one of his most controversial papers yet,

376
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,200
salt and hypertension.

377
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:57,080
It was a mix of a commentary and a review, and in it, he revealed that this was about

378
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,160
more than just the scientific facts.

379
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,160
Dahl wrote,

380
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:12,320
My social life is plagued by people who think I am against their eating salt.

381
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:17,560
I am convinced that adding salt is bad, but I do not believe that it is a sin.

382
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:21,400
I noticed something when reading Dahl's papers.

383
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:29,000
He had a repulsion for adding salt, the literal action of adding salt to a meal.

384
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,880
It clearly bothered him.

385
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,600
In his earlier work, he came up with the idea to classify people in groups depending on

386
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,040
if they added salt to their meal or not.

387
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:41,320
Those who added salt without tasting food were classified as high intake.

388
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:45,680
Now this is a hilariously fallible way to classify people, and Dahl would acknowledge

389
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:50,400
that, but what this does is it unmasks the theory that Dahl is driven by.

390
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,720
The salt that is present naturally in a food is all that is necessary.

391
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,000
Any salt added after that is bad.

392
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,960
That's right, completely unsalted meals for the king of salt reduction in America.

393
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:06,000
He will stand at 10 toes down, you couldn't shove him off his position if you were coming

394
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,800
in at 6'5 and 280 pounds.

395
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,800
As he wrote,

396
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,320
What?

397
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,520
In other words, Dahl was saying that he believed his conclusion to be true regardless of any

398
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,080
evidence you brought to his table to say otherwise.

399
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:32,240
And uh oh, Dahl's immovable position seemed to have rubbed off on the government.

400
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,800
You see, we may think that we have lower sodium options at the grocery store because the public

401
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:43,200
spoke out and demanded better lower salt options or else, but no, that didn't happen.

402
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,800
Low salt labels aren't a result of the public's cry out, but a direct result of the government's

403
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,400
numerous initiatives.

404
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,400
You see, it wasn't just the WHO or just the NHLBI.

405
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,760
After that 1969 meeting, everyone got involved.

406
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:03,820
The USDA, FDA, ADA, AHA, AMA, NBA, I mean the list goes on.

407
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:07,080
Agencies comprised of scientists, doctors, health professionals, agencies I'd never

408
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,920
heard of, the media got involved.

409
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:13,540
This was a nationwide effort from every relevant corner of the entire government.

410
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:20,200
The government tasked food industries to emphasize low sodium labeling and to make more low sodium

411
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,200
options.

412
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,320
Low salt labeling started to appear in grocery stores all across America.

413
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:30,640
This is one of the most grand dietary movements to ever take place in the United States.

414
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,800
Okay, so back to thinking about our thoughts.

415
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,440
We didn't get this from staying hip to the latest research.

416
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:43,360
Most of us had no idea what was going on in the 70s, but all of us have been in the grocery

417
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,360
store.

418
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,320
When you see a food and you see the low salt alternative, you cannot avoid the thought

419
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,600
that this ingredient cannot be good for me.

420
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,300
Now, multiply this by the media influence on the topic, multiply this by what your friends

421
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:01,000
and family say about salt, and we may not have paid attention to it, but most of us

422
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,880
have subliminally villainized salt.

423
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,560
You see, we have the order all wrong.

424
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:11,240
The research started it all, which then influenced the government, which then charged food industries,

425
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,880
which then influenced us.

426
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,560
The problem here is the same problem that we've been having for decades.

427
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,560
Where is the influence coming from?

428
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,560
There's two options.

429
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,520
In TOPS, who I mentioned earlier, I think he hit the nail on the head.

430
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,520
Public health policy versus good science.

431
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,080
Two behemoths, Godzilla versus King Kong.

432
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:33,400
TOPS also quoted Drum and Rini, an esteemed nephrologist who says, you can say without

433
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:38,680
a shadow of a doubt that NHLBI has made a commitment to salt education that goes way

434
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,640
beyond the scientific facts.

435
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,920
So Godzilla might be cheating a little bit.

436
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:49,240
The government going beyond the scope of facts to make policy sounds shady, right?

437
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:54,840
Any time there's a gap between the government doing something and why the government is

438
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,280
doing something, it's very tempting to want to bridge it.

439
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:02,080
Any attempt to bridge this gap is going to come off as conspiratorial.

440
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,280
If anything like me, you kind of check out when things become all about conspiracy.

441
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:10,920
They may serve a function somewhere, but in general, they kind of leave you cynical versus

442
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,920
empowered.

443
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,960
All masters will only have two things left to do.

444
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,920
We got to get down to dirty with the biology.

445
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,480
What's actually taking place in the body between sodium and blood pressure?

446
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,920
Then we got to look at the science, the big picture, and come up with a salty verdict.

447
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,920
Hey, fun fact.

448
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,280
Did you know I make these videos all on my own, completely independent?

449
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,360
And I'm not saying that for any reason other than the fact that I've read that some of

450
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,480
you guys think that I have a team.

451
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,480
I don't.

452
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,000
It's just me.

453
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,280
But I do have my supporters, you guys, and we still haven't come up with a community

454
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,160
name, but I think we're onto something with this hat.

455
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,160
It's yours.

456
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,160
It's available to you.

457
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,240
Check it out in the below.

458
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,240
In the below.

459
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,600
I almost had it one take.

460
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,080
Check it out in the link in the description.

461
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:59,520
Sodium and hypertension, a large part driving the confusion behind the topic, is the question

462
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,520
of how.

463
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,640
If sodium is affecting blood pressure, then how?

464
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,440
What mechanisms are at play here?

465
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,560
As this review states, pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to increased blood pressure values

466
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:12,400
have been long time debated and have not yet been completely elucidated.

467
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,800
In other words, the connection between sodium and blood pressure is an intricate one, and

468
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:22,200
no one has been able to say with 100% certainty that they know exactly what's going on here.

469
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,360
There are really three theories we're going to go over here, and it may be time to sit

470
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,720
up and lean in because this first one is packed with stuff we got to talk about.

471
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,680
Most folks, including a lot of scientists, believe in this first theory, and that is

472
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,840
the water retention theory.

473
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,280
We know sodium as an electrolyte.

474
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,160
We know a trait of electrolytes is that where they go, water follows.

475
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:46,160
With this, we can assume that an increase of sodium leads to a retention of sodium,

476
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,640
which leads to a retention of water.

477
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,960
The kidney is only letting out so much free water as it wants to keep some, so we aren't

478
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,520
too soft concentrated.

479
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:58,800
We end up reaching this steady water retained state.

480
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,880
More water means increased blood value, and increased blood value means increased blood

481
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,880
pressure.

482
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,000
Okay, can anybody guess where this theory can go wrong?

483
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,880
The answer isn't right in our face, and actually we have to zoom in a little bit.

484
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:16,720
A group of researchers were in a lab studying six healthy nonhypertensive men and gave them

485
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,480
increasingly more salt over the course of 24 days with the intentions of measuring something

486
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,920
totally unrelated to the subject at hand.

487
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:28,080
But their procedure led them to accidentally discover something that they weren't expecting.

488
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:33,040
They found that an increase of sodium did not lead to an increase of the body's water,

489
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,160
but a shift in the body's water.

490
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:40,120
The finding was so exciting that they did another study to focus on just that finding.

491
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,040
They performed a randomized control trial.

492
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,360
We got ourselves a gold batch.

493
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:49,800
They took 32 healthy nonhypertensive men and split them into four groups to be fed different

494
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,960
amounts of salt over seven days.

495
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:57,640
One group at 1,500 milligrams of salt, one at 6,000, one at 12,100, and finally, one

496
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,600
at 16,700.

497
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,960
Enough salt to make Louis Ketchum the doll sit up in his grave.

498
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,600
What they found was remarkable.

499
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:09,160
There was no water retention effect.

500
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,200
No water retention effect.

501
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,200
You hear that voice switch up, mess around, drop a podcast on y'all, change the game up.

502
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,160
Listen, if you really want to understand the weight of these researchers' results, and

503
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:23,600
not only that, but the actual relationship between salt and blood pressure, we do have

504
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,400
to go a little deeper.

505
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:30,000
And if you're anything like me, once you start to go a little deep, you kind of lose it.

506
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,640
So I heard that if you hit the like button, that increases your chances of understanding

507
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,880
by like 15%.

508
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,040
Don't be the person to not find out.

509
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,040
Intracellular water is the water that resides inside of ourselves.

510
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:47,960
There's a lot of places for the body to put water other than inside of ourselves, so extracellular

511
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:53,400
water, water outside of ourselves, has to be compartmentalized to smaller subcompartments.

512
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,440
One is intravascular water, the water within our blood vessels.

513
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,720
The other is interstitial water, the water running in between everything.

514
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:04,200
What these researchers found was that the intravascular fluid volume was the fluid compartment that

515
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:09,400
increased after salt loading, and somehow, extracellular fluid volume was unaffected.

516
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,440
Now, when I say I was befuddled reading this, I was absolutely befuddled.

517
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,840
How can something that is within something increase in volume, but the whole entire thing

518
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,840
doesn't increase in volume?

519
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,440
If we picture this out, it's like having one big balloon, and inside of it are two

520
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,680
smaller balloons.

521
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:28,680
One of them increases in volume, but the big balloon's volume doesn't change.

522
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,680
How can this happen?

523
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:34,420
Well, the researchers found there was a shift of the interstitial fluid into the intravascular

524
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:37,760
fluid, like one little balloon giving air to the other.

525
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,840
The researchers also found this experiment to have no effect on the participant's blood

526
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,320
pressure throughout the study.

527
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,800
How?

528
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:49,760
Intravascular fluid increased, which means blood volume increased, which means blood pressure

529
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,640
should increase, right?

530
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:56,560
The researchers mentioned after a high salt mill, the blood volume is going to increase.

531
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:00,600
It seems for healthy individuals, this effect is temporary, or what we call transient.

532
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,480
As the researchers noted, this increased blood volume lasted for only an hour or two.

533
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,200
This is me saying this, not them.

534
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,760
I believe they didn't find an effect on blood pressure because it's not like the

535
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:14,480
blood pressure never budged during the study, but they said that they measured it in the

536
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:21,760
morning, not directly after salt loading, which would mean that the participant's underlying

537
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,920
blood pressure throughout the entire study was unaffected.

538
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:30,920
I told you to lean in and buckle up.

539
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:36,960
Now how can the body hold more sodium, yet not retain a corresponding amount of water?

540
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:42,040
This was hinted at a non-osmolar storage of sodium, meaning sodium in the body that is

541
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,880
not impacting water balance.

542
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,840
This is absolutely buck wild.

543
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,960
This ninja sodium in the body.

544
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:52,120
If we dove deeper into this, we'd be steering way off of the course of this video, but we're

545
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:57,000
starting to enter the territory of understanding just how complex this relationship between

546
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,640
sodium and blood pressure actually is.

547
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,800
This isn't the only research paper that shakes things up.

548
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:06,280
We're learning and discovering that sodium handling, how the body handles sodium, it's

549
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,440
much more dynamic than what we thought.

550
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:14,120
Theory number two is a popular theory introduced by scientists named Guyton in 1991, explained

551
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:19,320
that the kidney and its related system is really the judge of if we undergo high blood pressure

552
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,280
from excess salt or not.

553
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:25,000
The kidney is closely intertwined with hormones, enzymes, and other little things that tightly

554
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,120
regulate fluid balance, the tightening and widening of blood vessels, as well as blood

555
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,280
pressure overall.

556
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,920
To keep things simple, we'll refer to this as the kidney fluid system.

557
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:38,040
The kidney fluid system is one of the systems in charge of keeping the body in homeostasis,

558
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:41,200
a.k.a. a state of physiological balance.

559
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,080
The Guyton theory goes as follows.

560
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:47,240
Increased salt results in increased thirst, increased thirst results in increased water

561
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,640
drinking to balance it out.

562
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,440
This increase in body fluid leads to increased volume of the blood, which then increases

563
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,640
blood pressure.

564
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,760
He says as long as the kidney fluid system functions normally, we can eat either extremely

565
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:05,360
small amounts of salt or as much as 50 times as much without a major alteration in blood

566
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,480
pressure.

567
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,160
By this theory, regarding blood pressure, a person's salt sensitivity could be determined

568
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:16,360
by how much of a bottleneck or a handicap a person's kidney fluid system is.

569
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:20,600
In a sense that if a person's kidney cannot pee out enough sodium to keep things balanced

570
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:27,040
without sufficiently raising the blood pressure, then that person is more salt sensitive.

571
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:31,080
Now, the Guyton theory is one of the most recognized theories there is, but it is not

572
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,120
the walk-off home run answer.

573
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,920
There's still a lot of nuance going on here.

574
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,320
Theory number three isn't really much of a theory.

575
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:41,080
It's just an excuse for me to bring up the sympathetic nervous system because our nervous

576
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,960
system is all up in the mix of this relationship with sodium and blood pressure.

577
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,000
The sympathetic nervous system is in charge of our fight or flight mode, the mode that

578
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,240
activates when we're stressed, in danger, or highly active.

579
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,440
This mode is always on just in varying degrees.

580
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,280
Its activity is hiding when you're getting ready to skydive out of a plane, and its activity

581
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,680
is lessened when you're winding down with some bedside reading.

582
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:07,880
The sympathetic nervous system is the major system behind our blood pressure responses.

583
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:12,520
This study on lab rats found that after a high salt regimen, it wasn't the salt itself

584
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:17,120
that increased blood pressure, but an over-activation of the sympathetic nervous system that made

585
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,920
the rats more sensitive to the salt.

586
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,400
Another rat study, I mean take it how you want, but I could not possibly create this

587
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:28,040
video without mentioning the sympathetic nervous system, which quick tip we can directly

588
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,560
influence by breathing.

589
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:35,440
I always say there's a reason we are designed to control what is otherwise automatic in

590
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,440
breathing.

591
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,920
Again, not going too deep here, but I want us to get into the headspace of what all is

592
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,920
going into this.

593
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:44,040
There's a reason you never heard of how salt and blood pressure are connected because

594
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:48,760
how can we even explain it in just a few sentences, but there is something going on.

595
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,960
It just isn't as linear as 1, 2, 3, ABC.

596
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:57,680
It's more like 1, 2 percent sign X of left, down, down, right.

597
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:05,280
Now we have to ask the question, if the connection between salt and blood pressure is so not

598
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:10,320
straightforward, then why are our instructions so straightforward?

599
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,080
Reduce your salt intake.

600
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:17,320
With one of the most cited recommendations being the WHO, less than 2,000 milligrams

601
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,880
of sodium, that's 5 grams of salt.

602
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,280
That's about this much.

603
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,200
Not a salty pebble more.

604
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,200
That's it.

605
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,000
I may have an unpopular opinion here, but I don't think there's anything inherently

606
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,200
wrong with the prescription of less than 2,000 milligrams, however I do believe it's enormously

607
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:43,960
irresponsible for myself, the government, or anyone to dub 2,000 as the magic number.

608
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:48,840
The idea that we could fit every single body on the same less than 2,000 milligrams boat

609
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:54,280
and happily ship that salty sucker off smooth sailing down the river is ridiculous.

610
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:58,560
All right, I gotta clean up all the salt that I spilled on the floor.

611
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:02,600
The salt saga is just like running the 400 meter hurdle race.

612
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,240
There is barrier after barrier after barrier.

613
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:10,360
If we want to get the answers that we want, then we gotta traverse over these hurdles.

614
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,360
What are these hurdles?

615
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:15,640
Well, it's the research, it's kind of bad, and it's getting in the way.

616
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,960
Let's zoom out and understand the scope of the issue.

617
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,680
Blood pressure.

618
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,680
The goal?

619
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,520
Figure out if and how they're connected.

620
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,720
How can we go about this?

621
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,880
We have two options, really.

622
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,840
Observational studies and interventional studies.

623
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,160
In observational studies, we're looking at a population.

624
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:35,200
We assess their salt intake, we assess their blood pressure, and boom, we have our results.

625
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,040
There are different ways to go about this, and each method yielding different levels

626
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,760
of quality in the results.

627
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,080
We can do a 24-hour recall.

628
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:49,360
Hey, population of people, us scientists, are time to figure out how much sodium you

629
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,360
consume.

630
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:56,360
Please tell us what you've eaten over the last 24 hours.

631
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:00,040
Most of us hardly remember what we had just a few hours ago for breakfast.

632
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:05,560
Not to mention, this method only captures one day, and unless the entire population

633
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:11,920
of people is the type to sling together the same ham sandwich every single day for lunch,

634
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,720
then one day just won't cut it.

635
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,000
24-hour recall, try it.

636
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:24,280
We could do food records.

637
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:28,200
This is prone to bias, and it's hard to get a large group of people to adhere to this

638
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,240
method, especially if you don't have them gathered up in the laboratory.

639
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:35,520
Food records, better than 24-hour recall, but still garbage.

640
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:48,360
What about a food frequency questionnaire?

641
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:52,160
This method has similar issues as the past two, plus it's not specific enough.

642
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:59,360
So food frequency questionnaire, the best method to measure sodium in an observational study

643
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,800
would have to be collecting pee.

644
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:10,000
Not from just one urine sample, not from just a few urine samples over eight hours,

645
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:17,360
but it's going to have to be the gold standard of collecting multiple consecutive 24-hour

646
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,960
pee tests.

647
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,360
That's the only way to get an accurate snapshot of a person's sodium intake.

648
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:28,120
Okay, I'm being a little facetious when I call the research straight up bad, but I want

649
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:32,720
us to understand the challenge that we've been facing and continue to face.

650
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:39,320
Sodium varies way too much day to day to do anything other than multiple 24-hour pee

651
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,320
tests.

652
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,880
However, these tests are very difficult to orchestrate.

653
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,680
Imagine being in one of these studies and you were tasked to have every single urine

654
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,280
episode collected for two to three days.

655
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,680
When it comes to observational studies, the harder something is for scientists and the

656
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:58,360
population to carry out, the less people the study will have.

657
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,360
The easier it is for everyone, the more people.

658
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:04,760
So we're choosing between what we want, a high volume of folks at the expense of accuracy

659
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,400
or high accuracy at the expense of the amount of folks.

660
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,720
The American Heart Association put out an article just about how many chances there

661
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,080
are for a large observational study to go wrong.

662
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:20,040
What if there are participants who were instructed by their doctor to reduce sodium or they're

663
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,360
on blood pressure meds?

664
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,360
What if some folks are sick or have pre-existing conditions?

665
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,280
What about confounding factors like age, sex, race, or smoking?

666
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,560
The imbalance, too many people, too far apart in age or race, what if the researchers suck

667
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,560
at following up?

668
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,760
I mean, the list goes on and on, but now that we have a solid understanding of the plight

669
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,400
of observational studies, let's overview interventional.

670
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,920
And short interventional studies are just when the researchers do something, they intervene

671
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,160
with the subjects.

672
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,520
They typically look like this.

673
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,760
We split subjects up into two or more groups, we give subjects different levels of salt,

674
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,480
and we measure their blood pressure responses.

675
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:57,040
Interventional studies have a spectrum of quality as well, but are miles ahead of observational

676
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:02,120
studies in terms of the value that we get because of the level of control that the researchers

677
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,120
get.

678
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:06,520
We can be extremely picky over the exact avatar of a person we want to measure.

679
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,560
We can keep folks in a lab for a few days.

680
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,200
We can feed exact amounts of sodium.

681
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,320
We can randomize participants, blind them to what we're measuring.

682
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,900
We can have a control group to balance out results.

683
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,400
We have control.

684
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:22,880
Now, interventional studies aren't completely free of biases and other error, but they are

685
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:28,540
the reason that in general, the scientific community does agree that reducing sodium

686
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,560
can reduce blood pressure.

687
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,440
And that leads us perfectly into this next one.

688
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:40,400
After 120 years of measuring salt and blood pressure, what do we agree on?

689
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,400
Three things.

690
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,320
Number one, the scientific community generally agrees this is hard.

691
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:49,080
It's really hard to get the number of how much sodium.

692
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:53,480
The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, or NASM, is a non-governmental

693
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,840
independent organization.

694
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:58,600
The nutritional arm of this organization are the folks who come up with dietary reference

695
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,600
intakes.

696
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,560
Information the public receives on how much of stuff we should be consuming.

697
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:06,760
For example, this amount of vitamin A will cover the ground for a majority of healthy

698
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,760
folks.

699
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,320
This amount of vitamin A is probably pushing it.

700
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,320
When they can't come up with these exact numbers, they pull out what they call the adequate

701
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:19,040
intake number, which is used to basically say, hey, you need at least this much.

702
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,560
There ain't enough evidence to come up with anything else.

703
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,560
And you guessed it.

704
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,400
I looked at the sodium report and I haven't seen the words insufficient evidence repeated

705
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,120
more than anything I've ever read.

706
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,080
So they have to come up with this adequate intake number.

707
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:33,000
And in order to do this, they have to look at sodium balance.

708
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Sodium balance.

709
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,920
If we can measure every molecule of sodium entering and leaving someone, we may be able

710
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,600
to get a good idea of how much is physiologically needed.

711
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,880
This is so incredibly hard to do that NASM mentioned only two studies were able to pull

712
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,960
it off and they said only one was rigorous enough.

713
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,040
In the end, NASM came up with the adequate intake number of 1500 milligrams.

714
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:58,800
But the number doesn't matter as much as why they state these numbers are so hard to come

715
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,800
up with.

716
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,200
Secretration and infradient rhythm.

717
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,040
What language am I speaking?

718
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:10,720
NASM pointed out these two things as another factor, not only widening the difference between

719
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:16,800
an individual and a separate individual, but the difference between an individual and himself.

720
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:21,480
Secretion refers to sodium storage in the body that isn't subject to excretion.

721
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:25,920
So in the same way that we stash our piggy banks in the top left corner of our closets,

722
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,440
there's emerging evidence that our body does this as well with sodium.

723
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,880
Infradient rhythm refers to how sodium handling in the body isn't subject to circadian rhythm.

724
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,640
Like our hormones are, for example.

725
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:40,000
What the body does with sodium within 24 hours may be miles away from what it will do in

726
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
the next.

727
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,280
Agreement number two, we're going to pull out a review published in 2020 that highlighted

728
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,680
areas of agreement for my own personal convenience.

729
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:51,240
There's general agreement that reducing sodium intake reduces blood pressure, especially

730
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:55,800
in people with hypertension, especially in people with hypertension.

731
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:59,440
An important note, I wanted to highlight something that was said in another review.

732
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,680
More studies have confirmed the benefit of reducing sodium intake in hypertensive subjects

733
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,680
with a high salt intake.

734
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:10,800
It is unclear whether the remaining more than 90% of the population will profit from a dietary

735
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,160
sodium restriction.

736
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:17,360
It would perhaps be more correct to start discussing inappropriate rather than excessive

737
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,360
salt intake.

738
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:23,040
Thirdly, the scientific community also generally agrees that high sodium intake is deleterious.

739
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,520
The review went on to say, mortality from cardiovascular disease increased at the highest

740
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,720
levels of sodium consumption, noting over 5,000 milligrams.

741
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,200
Mortality referring to the rate of death.

742
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:37,160
We want mortality to be low, and now is actually the perfect time to hop right into it.

743
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,720
Let's not wait a moment further.

744
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,040
We're going to discuss the big picture.

745
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,600
We're talking about salt and blood pressure.

746
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:50,600
We are using blood pressure as the risk factor, meaning an increased blood pressure equals

747
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,640
an increased risk.

748
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,640
Increased risk of what?

749
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,640
Cardiovascular disease.

750
00:41:55,640 --> 00:42:02,560
This lives under the assumption that an increased blood pressure can eventually lead to cardiovascular

751
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,560
disease.

752
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,720
So high blood pressure isn't the problem.

753
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:11,320
Now saying it isn't a problem, but it is one of the handful of things that is indicative

754
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:15,760
of an individual who may suffer from a cardiovascular disease.

755
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,240
Can high sodium increase blood pressure?

756
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,280
Yes, we've learned that.

757
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:24,840
Does high sodium increase blood pressure in every person every time?

758
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,120
No, it does not.

759
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,240
We've learned that.

760
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,720
Sodium has a relationship with blood pressure.

761
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:33,560
Its relationship is not linear for everyone across the board.

762
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:37,360
Sodium is also not the only factor modulating blood pressure.

763
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:44,080
So sodium cannot be the sole reason we would develop cardiovascular disease.

764
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,080
Why do I bring this up?

765
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,000
Because we've made it all about salt.

766
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,680
But when we bring up the increased mortality rate of individuals consuming these levels

767
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:57,320
of salt, we have to ask, where are they getting this salt from?

768
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:03,200
450 adults, Alabama, California, and Minnesota, equal numbers of men and women from each

769
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:07,480
ethnic group of blacks, Asians, Hispanics, and whites were assessed.

770
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:16,040
They found that over 70% of the sodium consumed was from processed foods.

771
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:20,400
I've read how high salt is linked to other diseases other than cardiovascular diseases,

772
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,400
right?

773
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,640
Like stomach cancer or kidney disease.

774
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:27,480
But I mean, come on, I'd be shocked if it wasn't connected to these things considering

775
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,480
that high salt is coming straight from the stuff that's been taking us out the whole

776
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,480
time.

777
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,080
So, what's the total of this ingredient list?

778
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,280
Can you guess the food?

779
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,080
So ingredient lists are ordered from what's present in the food in the highest amount

780
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,720
to the lowest.

781
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,880
Sugar is the first ingredient.

782
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:48,840
Okay, so this was a bag of popcorn, but somehow popcorn ended up being the second ingredient?

783
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,320
How do you even pull that off?

784
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:54,800
How can knocking back stuff like this with loads of sugar, problematic oils, and miscellaneous

785
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:59,160
synthetic stuff not be linked to various diseases?

786
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:02,320
Okay, but what do we focus on sodium alone?

787
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:07,520
Well, two handfuls of this stuff will net us somewhere around 160 milligrams of sodium.

788
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,120
But this bag of popcorn is a pretty bad offender.

789
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,120
What about this?

790
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,360
A slice of sandwich bread.

791
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:16,400
We're looking at about 130 milligrams of sodium.

792
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:21,760
Perhaps with this we have a sausage, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich for breakfast.

793
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,520
For lunch, we're having canned veggie soup with a turkey sami.

794
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:29,440
The fam had spaghetti for dinner, but we weren't that hungry, so we only had a teeny bit along

795
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,560
with a side salad with that hidden valley ranch.

796
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:38,280
At the end of the day, we end up somewhere around 2,695 milligrams of sodium.

797
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:42,880
This isn't an outrageous number by any means, but that's actually not the point.

798
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:43,880
Look at it this way.

799
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:50,480
Popular strawberry flavored breakfast bar, strawberry, potato chips, potato, canned tomato

800
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,440
sauce, tomato.

801
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:56,840
Naturally, whole foods ain't coming along with a lot of salty baggage.

802
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:00,840
From the farm to your plate, who has more input on your food?

803
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,440
You or the food industry?

804
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:08,040
The more responsibility over our food we relinquish up to the food industry, the more

805
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,360
salt our food will end up having.

806
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:15,080
Some of the saltiest of the bunch being cured meats, canned items, and bread adds up as well.

807
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,360
The food industry needs to add salt for a ton of reasons.

808
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:20,960
Preservation, flavor helps with coloration, and even texture for some foods.

809
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,880
Okay, don't get me wrong here y'all.

810
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,800
It's not as if salt is the reason processed food is bad.

811
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,640
Processed food has a lot to be desired.

812
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:33,720
The problem is the same problem America has been facing from the jump.

813
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,560
Too much.

814
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:39,800
Most people ingest more salt than needed, but in the western world, this could be generalized

815
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:43,640
to all minerals, vitamins, energy sources, and even water.

816
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,240
Too many vitamins and minerals.

817
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,240
What about this?

818
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:50,040
Imagine the individual going through life on willy-nilly with their nutrition, ordering

819
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:54,080
and eating out, take out, grab and go, handful it is, handful it at, leaving their food

820
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,680
up to the will of the industry.

821
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:59,920
Versus the nutritionally proactive individual who starts with whole foods, adding their

822
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,720
own salt and going from there.

823
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:05,320
The sodium intake difference between these two people would be massive.

824
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:10,040
But even so, if we analyze the individual who is consuming these processed foods, this

825
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:14,560
is the same individual who is less likely to have an exercise routine, is less likely

826
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:19,880
to have a sleep routine, is less likely to have a de-stress routine, this person is less

827
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,840
likely to be health conscious.

828
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:26,440
You tell me, who is more likely to develop hypertension and cardiovascular disease?

829
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:30,760
Salt isn't the problem as far as lifestyle is the problem.

830
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:35,760
Wow.

831
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,760
I mean, there's so much we couldn't even get to.

832
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,920
Potassium, which is abundant in plant food, is kind of like the biological opposite of

833
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:42,920
sodium.

834
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:45,800
I didn't even mention some of the awesome functions of sodium, how it's a major player

835
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,120
in our nervous system.

836
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,760
I kind of think of sodium as the mineral of action.

837
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,440
Without it, we'd be as stiff as a street light.

838
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:55,720
I'm sure I'll see a comment about the inter-salt study of 88, one of the largest international

839
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,280
studies ever done.

840
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,600
Another seminal point to the salty saga, still questions to be answered.

841
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,760
What about the sodium needs of a person that simply moves more?

842
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,400
How do my sodium needs change as my life changes in season?

843
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:11,160
You should be asking yourself, how did I get to this point in the video and not leave a

844
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,160
like?

845
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,160
Love you guys.

846
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:14,160
Thanks so much.

847
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,160
I hope you gained some insight and some perspective.

848
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,160
I'm going to get a batch out of the way.

849
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,440
Bye.

850
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,440

852

Bye.

853

Bye.

854
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,440
Bye.

855

Bye.

856
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:29,440
Bye.

857
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,440
Bye.

858
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,440
Bye.

859
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,440
Bye.

860
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,440
Bye.

861
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,440
Bye.

862
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:35,440
Bye.

863
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,440
Bye.

864
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,440
Bye.

865
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,440
Bye.

866
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,440
Bye.

867
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,440
Bye.

868
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,440
Bye.

869
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,440
Bye.

870
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:43,440
Bye.

871
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,440
Bye.

872
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,440
Bye.

873
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,440
Bye.

874
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,440
Bye.

875
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,440
Bye.

876
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,440
Bye.
