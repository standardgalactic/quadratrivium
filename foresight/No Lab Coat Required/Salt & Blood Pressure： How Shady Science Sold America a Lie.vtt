00:00.000 --> 00:26.400
Okay, so, what do you think?

00:26.400 --> 00:27.560
It's salt.

00:27.560 --> 00:30.560
But you and I both know it's more than that.

00:30.560 --> 00:33.720
I mean, we could get into the technical size, but you just got here.

00:33.720 --> 00:35.120
We'll do that later.

00:35.120 --> 00:38.200
I'm more concerned about what you actually think.

00:38.200 --> 00:40.600
Remember that recommendation to cut salt.

00:40.600 --> 00:41.600
Salt.

00:41.600 --> 00:42.600
Salt.

00:42.600 --> 00:43.600
It has to be America's favorite flavoring.

00:43.600 --> 00:46.360
You might say the extra ingredient is salt.

00:46.360 --> 00:47.360
Put it in your medical study.

00:47.360 --> 00:48.360
New study.

00:48.360 --> 00:49.360
New study.

00:49.360 --> 00:52.240
Recent study is shiny light on the amount of sodium Americans eat.

00:52.240 --> 00:53.240
Slash salt.

00:53.240 --> 00:54.240
Easier said than done.

00:54.240 --> 00:57.040
This is one of those medical stories that people get confused about.

00:57.040 --> 01:00.360
Number one risk for a diet-related death sodium.

01:00.360 --> 01:04.280
Do you know the origin of your thoughts on salt?

01:04.280 --> 01:05.280
For some of us, yes.

01:05.280 --> 01:07.240
For the rest of us, think about it.

01:07.240 --> 01:08.400
Think about your thoughts.

01:08.400 --> 01:09.400
Thought-ception.

01:09.400 --> 01:13.640
Because what if I told you what you believe or don't believe about salt was influenced

01:13.640 --> 01:16.080
by something you never even considered?

01:16.080 --> 01:17.080
Look around.

01:17.080 --> 01:18.080
A standard American diet.

01:18.080 --> 01:19.800
We didn't just wake up like this.

01:19.800 --> 01:25.040
The research behind the food is how we ended up like this.

01:25.040 --> 01:26.640
Welcome to No Lab Corp require.

01:26.640 --> 01:35.560
My name is Johnny Cole Dixon and I swear we won't do the entire video like this.

01:35.560 --> 01:36.560
Sodium has a reputation.

01:36.560 --> 01:38.680
More accurately, it has an association.

01:38.680 --> 01:44.560
How many times have you heard, I'm limiting my salt, I'm watching over my blood pressure?

01:44.560 --> 01:49.280
Right now is probably the best time to mention that sodium and salt are not the same thing.

01:49.280 --> 01:51.480
We get the two mixed up and it's perfectly fine.

01:51.480 --> 01:52.480
It's okay.

01:52.480 --> 01:53.480
It happens.

01:53.480 --> 01:56.320
Even in the sacred world of academia, I've seen a research paper making this mistake.

01:57.320 --> 01:59.760
Sodium is an ingredient of salt.

01:59.760 --> 02:02.800
If you take a pinch of salt, only 40% is sodium.

02:02.800 --> 02:04.840
The rest of it is chloride.

02:04.840 --> 02:07.840
The other ingredient needed to make salt.

02:07.840 --> 02:08.840
Okay.

02:08.840 --> 02:09.840
Editing Johnny here.

02:09.840 --> 02:10.840
I know.

02:10.840 --> 02:11.840
Back to back interruptions.

02:11.840 --> 02:12.840
That's crazy.

02:12.840 --> 02:17.240
But now is probably also the best time to mention that I want this to be relevant for you.

02:17.240 --> 02:19.880
So we're talking about blood pressure, but why does this matter?

02:19.880 --> 02:24.120
Well, blood pressure is what we know as a precursor, meaning it comes before the main

02:24.120 --> 02:25.120
thing.

02:25.120 --> 02:27.920
The only thing we really want to avoid is the number one disease in the world, heart

02:27.920 --> 02:31.760
disease or cardiovascular disease, some form of fashion, just like if you wanted to graduate

02:31.760 --> 02:34.040
top of your class, that doesn't just happen.

02:34.040 --> 02:35.320
There has to be a precursor.

02:35.320 --> 02:37.080
Something has to take place prior.

02:37.080 --> 02:38.080
What will have to take place?

02:38.080 --> 02:40.200
You'd have to study a lot.

02:40.200 --> 02:41.280
Salt and blood pressure.

02:41.280 --> 02:43.200
Where did this association come from?

02:43.200 --> 02:45.200
Is it valid or invalid?

02:45.200 --> 02:47.340
How does this work in the body physically speaking?

02:47.340 --> 02:48.640
How much sodium do I need?

02:48.640 --> 02:49.640
So many questions.

02:49.640 --> 02:50.640
Adventure awaits.

02:50.640 --> 02:51.640
Let's hop in.

02:51.640 --> 02:56.760
Self-organization put out a publication in March of 2023, a big old document on sodium

02:56.760 --> 02:58.520
intake reduction.

02:58.520 --> 03:00.720
Because as they state, the evidence is clear.

03:00.720 --> 03:05.840
The more sodium we consume, the more our blood pressure rises and blood pressure is reduced

03:05.840 --> 03:08.680
when dietary sodium intake is reduced.

03:08.680 --> 03:13.800
Reducing sodium intake is one of the most cost effective ways to improve health.

03:13.800 --> 03:14.800
Dang.

03:14.800 --> 03:15.800
Poor sodium.

03:15.800 --> 03:17.880
It ain't got a lot going for it right now.

03:17.880 --> 03:22.320
So according to the WHO, the answer is as straightforward as an error.

03:22.320 --> 03:26.800
Real quick, because I brought up the WHO, it always seems that health communicators are

03:26.800 --> 03:28.960
at odds with these big entities, right?

03:28.960 --> 03:30.720
WHO, FDA, USDA.

03:30.720 --> 03:34.240
It must be because they're corrupted and want to profit off of everything with two

03:34.240 --> 03:36.920
legs.

03:36.920 --> 03:37.920
Not entirely.

03:37.920 --> 03:38.920
Look at it this way.

03:38.920 --> 03:39.920
Just entertain this with me.

03:39.920 --> 03:43.720
Let's say you're getting a lecture from Professor Johnny about the sun.

03:43.720 --> 03:47.280
Professor Johnny says the sun is great for plants, not for humans.

03:47.280 --> 03:50.000
Put sunscreen on and stay in the shade if you know what's good for you.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.520
You go to a different lecture where a separate professor, Professor Cole Dixon, is talking

03:54.520 --> 03:57.920
about the sun as well, but his presentation is different.

03:57.920 --> 04:01.880
He talks about the different rays the sun provides, vitamin D, melanin production, the

04:01.880 --> 04:05.440
spectrum of extreme sun exposure to being a vampire.

04:05.440 --> 04:08.360
What's the difference between these two professors?

04:08.360 --> 04:09.360
Nuance.

04:09.360 --> 04:13.040
You see, a lack of nuance raises three flags against a communicator.

04:13.040 --> 04:17.640
Flag one, it seems they've ignored the blatantly obvious contrarian evidence.

04:17.640 --> 04:21.240
Flag two, they're one-sided points just reek of bias.

04:21.240 --> 04:24.880
Flag three, which is really just a result of flag one and two, is that they look like

04:24.880 --> 04:27.200
they have an ulterior motive.

04:27.200 --> 04:32.320
And turns out Professor Johnny was a sunscreen dealer, CEO of Sunny Johnny's sunscreen

04:32.320 --> 04:33.320
enterprises.

04:33.320 --> 04:36.560
Okay, let's go back to that WHO passage and highlight something.

04:36.560 --> 04:41.000
The more sodium we consume, the more our blood pressure rises.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
That's the messaging.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
How do we get here?

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Let's find out.

04:44.000 --> 04:50.600
1904, where it all began.

04:50.600 --> 04:55.240
This was the first study to report a positive correlation between salt intake and blood

04:55.240 --> 05:00.080
pressure in humans.

05:00.080 --> 05:04.800
Two French researchers gathered six patients and noticed an increase in salt intake was

05:04.800 --> 05:07.520
associated with a rise of blood pressure.

05:07.520 --> 05:11.320
Interestingly, the researchers also observed that some of the patient's blood pressure

05:11.320 --> 05:13.880
barely budged after massive salt intake.

05:13.880 --> 05:18.040
And the researchers wondered, perhaps there's an internal factor that modulates the blood

05:18.040 --> 05:19.840
pressure from one person to another.

05:19.840 --> 05:25.680
Possibly, what made these two groups have totally separate responses to high salt intake?

05:25.680 --> 05:26.680
We'll get to this later.

05:26.680 --> 05:27.680
This was a novel finding.

05:27.680 --> 05:32.160
The French researchers were going to advance their field greatly from this one discovery.

05:32.160 --> 05:37.400
But they were rebutted only three years later by a German researcher who opposed the findings

05:37.400 --> 05:38.400
of the French.

05:38.400 --> 05:40.560
He was skeptical of the salt blood pressure relationship.

05:40.560 --> 05:45.200
He called out his French peers as wrong and labeled their experimentation as flawed.

05:45.200 --> 05:50.560
There it was in early 1900s in black and white, two opposite findings, two opposing sides,

05:50.560 --> 05:53.200
the pioneers and the skeptics.

05:53.200 --> 05:56.960
Sounds like a good baseball game.

05:56.960 --> 06:00.960
This is when the salty saga, the great debate, officially began.

06:00.960 --> 06:02.760
You're given the options when you grocery shop.

06:02.760 --> 06:07.520
You can get the regular item or you can get the item's low sodium cousin.

06:07.520 --> 06:11.120
People read something like low sodium, light or less salt.

06:11.120 --> 06:14.800
When food companies take an ingredient out, it's usually something we've all agreed

06:14.800 --> 06:17.280
upon is generally not great for humans, right?

06:17.280 --> 06:18.960
Like high fructose corn syrup.

06:18.960 --> 06:23.280
But salt, as this academic commentary states, is the only essential component of mammals

06:23.280 --> 06:26.000
to have obtained an unattractive status.

06:26.000 --> 06:31.960
The world salt may have found its footing in the early 1900s, but it wasn't until 1960

06:31.960 --> 06:37.120
when a man hailing from Long Island, New York, by the name Louis Kitchener Dahl, made everybody

06:37.280 --> 06:38.280
pick a side.

06:38.280 --> 06:39.280
Two studies.

06:39.280 --> 06:44.240
Dahl published two studies, one in 1960 and one in 1962, which is like back to back in

06:44.240 --> 06:48.200
scientific standards, two back to back albums, holding it down from the 60 to the 62.

06:48.200 --> 06:51.800
These two studies are what many consider to be the seminal point.

06:51.800 --> 06:55.120
This is when the salty saga really started to heat up.

06:55.120 --> 07:00.200
Study number one, Dahl had been doing some observational work with salt intake and populations.

07:00.200 --> 07:03.920
He traveled around the world with a small elite task force to perform a duty of the

07:03.920 --> 07:07.000
utmost importance, collecting pee.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.080
That's right, the 24 hour pee test is the gold standard for measuring a person's sodium

07:11.080 --> 07:12.080
intake levels.

07:12.080 --> 07:14.440
Over 90% of sodium is excreted through the kidney.

07:14.440 --> 07:18.320
Considering you're healthy and didn't just come off of a mean game of Batman or an intense

07:18.320 --> 07:23.480
game of chess, anything you'd sweat significantly because a collection of the last 24 hours

07:23.480 --> 07:26.360
of your urine says a lot about where your sodium is at.

07:26.360 --> 07:31.000
Dahl and his team collected data from the US, northern Japan, southern Japan, Marshall

07:31.000 --> 07:34.480
Islanders, which is somewhere in the middle of the ocean, and finally Alaska.

07:34.480 --> 07:38.120
The Alaskans average less than four grams of salt consumption, the Marshall Islanders

07:38.120 --> 07:42.120
about seven grams, the Americans about 10, the southern Japanese 14, and the northern

07:42.120 --> 07:44.280
Japanese 26 grams.

07:44.280 --> 07:47.880
He then measured up these folks salt intake against the prevalence of high blood pressure,

07:47.880 --> 07:50.080
which he indicated as 140 over 90.

07:50.080 --> 07:53.080
I'm in an extremely uncomfortable position before we get into Dahl's results for my

07:53.080 --> 07:55.800
folks who could use a little bit more insight on blood pressure.

07:55.800 --> 07:59.840
The measurement of blood pressure is expressed by two numbers called systolic and diastolic.

07:59.840 --> 08:02.280
Okay, sweet beans, what are the numbers actually telling us?

08:02.280 --> 08:05.480
So when our blood travels throughout the body, it's being pressed up against the walls

08:05.480 --> 08:06.480
of our blood vessels.

08:06.480 --> 08:09.800
And I know that sounds a little violent, but our blood vessels are perfectly capable

08:09.800 --> 08:10.800
of handling this.

08:10.800 --> 08:14.400
When the heart is actively pumping blood, we get systolic pressure, the high number because

08:14.400 --> 08:15.840
our blood just zoomed.

08:15.840 --> 08:18.960
And between heartbeats, the heart's relaxed and we get diastolic pressure, the lower

08:18.960 --> 08:21.360
number when the blood isn't zooming as much.

08:21.360 --> 08:27.320
This is the only place where you can define blood pressure with the word zooming.

08:27.320 --> 08:28.320
Stay in school.

08:28.320 --> 08:31.000
Dahl's results, we get them in 1960 and you guessed it.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.800
A near perfect correlation between sodium intake and prevalence of hypertension.

08:35.800 --> 08:39.320
The more solid you ate, the higher your blood pressure.

08:39.320 --> 08:44.200
Now Dahl's science here wasn't perfect and in fact to some it was considered negligible.

08:44.200 --> 08:48.920
As this commentary states, there were no details given concerning the measures if any that

08:48.920 --> 08:51.520
were used to avoid confounding and bias.

08:51.520 --> 08:54.080
Now this is a really big deal and we actually have to talk about this.

08:54.080 --> 08:59.520
A confounding factor is a variable that sneakily influences the outcome you're measuring.

08:59.520 --> 09:01.160
We can stick with the topic on hand.

09:01.160 --> 09:06.880
If we're measuring sodium and hypertension, a.k.a. chronically elevated blood pressure,

09:06.880 --> 09:10.320
what are some things other than sodium that may contribute to that?

09:10.320 --> 09:13.800
Well, we got stress, physical inactivity and we got age.

09:13.800 --> 09:16.000
These would be our confounding factors.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.560
Without proper action to account for these potential confounding factors influencing

09:19.560 --> 09:23.320
our results, we end up with a inflated conclusion.

09:23.320 --> 09:28.040
And if you're super slimy, you ignore confounding on purpose to give yourself leeway to say

09:28.040 --> 09:29.840
there's a relationship between two things.

09:29.840 --> 09:33.560
It's the difference between rolling a strike with the kitty railing up versus the kitty

09:33.560 --> 09:34.560
railing down.

09:34.560 --> 09:38.080
A kid may think his accuracy is all that, but he didn't account for the fact that the

09:38.080 --> 09:40.920
kitty railing greatly influenced his outcome.

09:40.920 --> 09:42.400
He would have been guttering it up.

09:42.400 --> 09:43.400
It's based on a true story.

09:43.400 --> 09:45.400
I was a kid.

09:45.400 --> 09:49.360
Now we can pick apart Dahl's research all day and there's been plenty of old researches

09:49.360 --> 09:50.440
to do just that.

09:50.440 --> 09:56.040
But this first study wasn't important because of its findings, but because it showed Dahl's

09:56.040 --> 09:57.520
beliefs about salt.

09:57.520 --> 10:00.760
You see, Dahl's paper plainly revealed what side of the fence he was on when it came

10:00.760 --> 10:05.160
to salt, categorizing it as a subtle lethal agent and putting it in the same light as

10:05.160 --> 10:09.720
fallout and carcinogens, later comparing it to fat, cigarettes, and alcohol.

10:09.720 --> 10:12.540
This was essentially Dahl's entry into the conversation, right?

10:12.540 --> 10:18.400
This was Dahl arriving at the pool party, but this next study, the 1962 one, was like

10:18.400 --> 10:24.480
him jumping into the pool, cannonballing and splashing everybody.

10:24.480 --> 10:25.480
How'd you like that one?

10:25.480 --> 10:29.520
Uh, I was not following.

10:29.520 --> 10:31.320
Sounded pretty descriptive though.

10:31.320 --> 10:35.040
Study number two, Dahl's 1962 study.

10:35.040 --> 10:39.280
This would be the one to effectively change the way Americans ate.

10:39.280 --> 10:42.740
Before we get into that, I did want to say that I thought I had a solid understanding

10:42.740 --> 10:46.520
of how big of a deal this salt thing was.

10:46.520 --> 10:51.800
Usually my research phase for a video can last anywhere from two days to two weeks.

10:51.800 --> 10:53.920
This took much longer than that.

10:53.920 --> 10:59.800
But rummaging through all of these old, salty research papers, I started to understand how

10:59.800 --> 11:02.680
big of a deal this was when I came across this.

11:02.680 --> 11:04.920
The Political Science of Salt.

11:04.920 --> 11:08.680
Written by Gary Tovs, it illustrates the territory we're about to embark on.

11:08.680 --> 11:13.560
The salt controversy constitutes one of the longest running, most vitriolic, and surreal

11:13.560 --> 11:15.680
disputes in all of medicine.

11:15.680 --> 11:20.200
On the one side are those experts who insist that the evidence that salt raises blood pressure

11:20.200 --> 11:22.240
is effectively irrefutable.

11:22.240 --> 11:25.960
On the other side are those researchers who argue that the data supporting universal salt

11:25.960 --> 11:28.400
reduction have never been compelling.

11:28.400 --> 11:31.040
You see, I wanted this video to be like flipping a coin, right?

11:31.040 --> 11:32.320
We all just want one answer.

11:32.320 --> 11:33.320
Believe me, I know.

11:33.320 --> 11:36.920
How cautious, if at all, do we have to be over our salt intake?

11:36.920 --> 11:38.400
Is that too much to ask?

11:38.400 --> 11:40.560
It shouldn't be, but it is.

11:40.560 --> 11:41.560
Why is that?

11:41.560 --> 11:43.160
Well, there's two reasons.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.760
One, we'll get to later.

11:44.760 --> 11:45.760
It's scientific.

11:45.760 --> 11:47.800
But this one, it's about ideology.

11:47.800 --> 11:52.920
You see, the study that opened up the salt saga in 1904 was monumental because of new

11:52.920 --> 11:54.120
revelation.

11:54.120 --> 11:57.800
We learned that salt may have something to do with blood pressure.

11:57.800 --> 12:02.360
As time passed, hypertension quickly became an area of high focus because it was recognized

12:02.360 --> 12:06.680
as a precursor to the number one disease in the world, heart disease.

12:06.680 --> 12:08.400
So many studies were done.

12:08.400 --> 12:09.400
Money was poured in.

12:09.400 --> 12:10.680
Resources were poured in.

12:10.680 --> 12:12.200
We need answers.

12:12.200 --> 12:13.200
And guess what?

12:13.200 --> 12:14.200
We got them.

12:14.200 --> 12:19.320
We started off so dang tribal about salt that it became less about the science and discovering

12:19.320 --> 12:21.960
truth and more about picking a side.

12:21.960 --> 12:27.080
The moment we pick a side is the moment we engage with science's greatest enemy, and

12:27.080 --> 12:29.160
that is confirmation bias.

12:29.160 --> 12:33.440
The mind under the veil of confirmation bias is so fascinating.

12:33.440 --> 12:38.880
We become so fixated on the thing that we believe or are convinced of that we will go

12:38.880 --> 12:42.760
to any length to prove that we're right, usually to ourselves.

12:42.880 --> 12:46.480
Back with any evidence that says otherwise, it's either black or it's white.

12:46.480 --> 12:47.760
There's no room for gray.

12:47.760 --> 12:52.520
And ignoring nuance affords us the luxury of being right.

12:52.520 --> 12:55.800
Bias can come from an agenda or it can come from straight up ego.

12:55.800 --> 12:57.880
Either way, we've made an absolute mess.

12:57.880 --> 13:03.080
Every government entity, every health communicator, every salty researcher has staked their position

13:03.080 --> 13:04.680
and gave guidelines.

13:04.680 --> 13:09.520
Either one, two, three, four, five, six or seven or eight grams of salt a day without

13:09.520 --> 13:11.360
regarding the nuance.

13:11.360 --> 13:15.320
And when we go deeper into the science in a bit here, we'll understand why this is

13:15.320 --> 13:17.200
such a huge mistake we've been making.

13:17.200 --> 13:20.920
So back to the Lewis Kitchener doll study of 1962, study number two.

13:20.920 --> 13:21.920
What do we got?

13:21.920 --> 13:22.920
We got rats.

13:22.920 --> 13:23.920
Varmit.

13:23.920 --> 13:24.920
Rodents.

13:24.920 --> 13:27.200
Just, it's just rats.

13:27.200 --> 13:30.760
Doll took 47 lab rats, just about half male and half female.

13:30.760 --> 13:35.440
They were put on an 11.6% seesaw chow over the course of four weeks.

13:35.440 --> 13:37.640
Observe something interesting.

13:37.640 --> 13:40.120
Some rats were developing elevated blood pressure.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.120
Some rats weren't.

13:41.120 --> 13:44.760
The Zynga, he then went on a selective breeding spree.

13:44.760 --> 13:48.240
Rats with the highest blood pressures were bred together and those with the lowest pressures

13:48.240 --> 13:49.240
were bred together.

13:49.240 --> 13:53.160
The kids of the high blood pressure parents were put on the same salty regimen and those

13:53.160 --> 13:56.280
of them that developed the highest blood pressures were then bred again.

13:56.280 --> 13:57.520
The rest were sent to lab rat heaven.

13:57.520 --> 14:00.680
And then of course on the flip side, the same went for the kids of the low blood pressure

14:00.680 --> 14:01.680
rats.

14:01.680 --> 14:03.360
Can you call it offspring of rats kids?

14:03.360 --> 14:06.720
Doll ended up with three generations of two separate groups of rats.

14:06.720 --> 14:10.120
Those that responded to the salt regimen with a relatively high blood pressure and those

14:10.120 --> 14:12.840
that responded with a relatively low blood pressure.

14:12.840 --> 14:17.840
And holy smokes, Doll jumped up, slapped his desk, yelled Eureka and brought around for

14:17.840 --> 14:20.840
all of his colleagues because he knew he was on to something.

14:20.840 --> 14:26.560
I mean, there's no evidence he actually did that, but good imagine.

14:26.560 --> 14:30.960
His rats that responded with high blood pressure from excess salt were coin salt sensitive.

14:30.960 --> 14:34.720
His rats that responded with low blood pressures were coin salt resistant.

14:34.720 --> 14:37.240
The results were published and it made absolute waves.

14:37.240 --> 14:41.160
I mean, as much as a scientific white paper could make, am I right?

14:41.160 --> 14:48.040
But the paper was so big and so impactful because it established the idea of salt sensitivity.

14:48.040 --> 14:52.040
Let's break down salt sensitivity, but first you're probably wondering if Doll's 1962

14:52.040 --> 14:53.960
study was better than his 1961 study.

14:53.960 --> 14:57.240
Let it be known that there has never been a single research paper published that did

14:57.240 --> 14:58.240
not undergo criticism.

14:58.240 --> 15:02.920
I mean, the world of academia is absolutely cutthroat, but for some reason when it comes

15:02.920 --> 15:07.360
to salt, it's cutthroat, ear, arm and leg.

15:07.360 --> 15:10.360
But 1962, that study published by Doll was actually pretty good.

15:10.360 --> 15:17.720
I mean, there was one sly researcher who pointed out an absolutely massive issue with the study.

15:17.720 --> 15:23.360
We're going to talk about this in a bit, but the structure and the way the study was performed

15:23.360 --> 15:25.120
was undeniably good.

15:25.120 --> 15:29.320
Salt sensitivity, the idea that we can inherit our blood pressure response to salt, as Doll

15:29.320 --> 15:32.640
put it, is about a genetically transmitted sensitivity to salt.

15:32.640 --> 15:36.760
What he observed was that the strain most prone to develop hypertension from salt did

15:36.760 --> 15:40.440
not develop hypertension when excess dietary salt was emitted.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.520
If you're anything like me, you're probably a little confused.

15:42.520 --> 15:43.520
Think of it this way.

15:43.520 --> 15:49.600
If my parents were Serena Williams and LeBron James, actually they're both happily married

15:49.600 --> 15:50.600
with kids.

15:50.600 --> 15:56.720
If I had two stellar athlete parents, I would have a predisposition to excel at sports.

15:56.720 --> 16:03.000
But if I was never exposed to a single basketball tennis racket or hockey stick, I would never

16:03.000 --> 16:06.920
have the chance to develop those athlete stellar skills.

16:06.920 --> 16:10.880
In the same way, the offspring of the high blood pressure rats never developed high

16:10.880 --> 16:14.840
blood pressure because they were never exposed to excess salt.

16:14.840 --> 16:20.520
Okay, now how well does Doll study and the concept of salt sensitivity translate to the

16:20.520 --> 16:21.520
real world?

16:21.520 --> 16:27.840
Doll was working with lab rats in a controlled environment where mating was precisely calculated.

16:27.840 --> 16:33.600
Humans don't live in that kind of world, so of course this isn't an exact translation.

16:33.600 --> 16:39.360
In fact, far from it because humans are really just that genetically complex.

16:39.360 --> 16:44.680
Now a quick search up on Dr. Google and you'll come across some entities settling on salt

16:44.680 --> 16:50.160
sensitivity as the resolution of salt's relationship with blood pressure.

16:50.160 --> 16:54.200
For example, the National Heart, Long and Blood Institute make mention of salt sensitivity

16:54.200 --> 16:56.320
in their Causes and Risk Factors article.

16:56.320 --> 17:02.040
Okay, now the concept of salt sensitivity is okay, it makes sense, but one of its biggest

17:02.040 --> 17:05.040
thoughts is that it is impossible to measure.

17:05.040 --> 17:12.840
There is no consensus on the defining lines that make an individual salt sensitive.

17:12.840 --> 17:16.920
These researchers put it best, both the amount of salt administered and the magnitude of

17:16.920 --> 17:22.560
the response above which pressure is considered to be salt sensitive vary enormously among

17:22.560 --> 17:23.560
studies.

17:23.560 --> 17:26.520
So basically scientists have been experimenting with the idea of salt sensitivity, but they're

17:26.520 --> 17:31.480
all using different amounts of salt and different salt sensitive thresholds.

17:31.480 --> 17:35.240
Like when is a person salt sensitive after they take in this much salt and their blood

17:35.240 --> 17:39.840
pressure rises this much or after they take in this much salt and their blood pressure

17:39.840 --> 17:41.000
rises this much?

17:41.000 --> 17:46.040
We can imagine this just opens up the world of conflicting data as each study is able

17:46.040 --> 17:48.360
to move the goalpost to how they see fit.

17:48.360 --> 17:54.240
Okay, now let's get to the Sly researcher who pointed out the massive issue with Dahl's

17:54.240 --> 17:56.200
1962 lab rat study.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.560
His name was F. O. Simpson.

17:58.560 --> 18:02.280
I'm not excited to say how many research papers I looked through to find this man's

18:02.280 --> 18:05.600
first name, but I do know his middle name is Olaf.

18:05.600 --> 18:11.080
He's often cited for pointing out that the amount of salt that Dahl gave those rats was

18:11.080 --> 18:13.600
simply enormous.

18:13.600 --> 18:16.640
According to Simpson's calculations, if you translate the amount of salt consumed by

18:16.640 --> 18:22.880
the rats and you make it relative to a 150-ish pound man, that man would be ingesting 560

18:22.880 --> 18:24.760
grams of salt a day.

18:24.760 --> 18:28.800
That's like knocking back 75% of an umbrella girl's salt container a day.

18:28.800 --> 18:31.720
That's over 215,000 milligrams of sodium.

18:31.720 --> 18:35.840
Now I did some more rodent research to find out if his calculations were accurate and

18:35.840 --> 18:40.640
from what I can judge, his formula was a little inflated, so I cut it in half.

18:40.680 --> 18:44.360
And obviously we're still talking about a ridiculous amount of salt at 280 grams of

18:44.360 --> 18:46.720
salt or 107,000 milligrams of sodium.

18:46.720 --> 18:51.860
So Dahl's 1962 lab rat study, on the one hand, it says a lot about the power of genetics.

18:51.860 --> 18:56.440
On the other hand, in order to achieve hypertension in those rats, he gave them just flat-out

18:56.440 --> 19:00.600
boo-cool loads of salt, unrealistic to the amount any human would ever consume.

19:00.600 --> 19:07.480
So the study has a twang of deep value and a few sprinkles of irrelevance.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.480
What do you make of it?

19:08.480 --> 19:13.040
It doesn't matter because Dahl and his rats quickly became the salt reduction champions

19:13.040 --> 19:14.400
of the United States.

19:14.400 --> 19:17.840
If you're talking salt and hypertension, you're talking Lewis, Kitchener, Dahl.

19:17.840 --> 19:20.880
He quickly became the front-running scientist for limiting salt.

19:20.880 --> 19:25.120
His influence started to reach beyond just the scientific community, now the government

19:25.120 --> 19:26.120
is getting involved.

19:28.120 --> 19:35.440
1969, the White House had its first meeting to talk about reducing salt for the nation.

19:35.440 --> 19:40.200
And in 1972, the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute sponsored the National Blood

19:40.200 --> 19:42.960
Pressure Education campaign, the first campaign.

19:42.960 --> 19:46.480
America is starting to get the message, and this campaign did not come out of nowhere.

19:46.480 --> 19:51.200
Just earlier, in the same year, Dahl released one of his most controversial papers yet,

19:51.200 --> 19:52.200
salt and hypertension.

19:52.200 --> 19:57.080
It was a mix of a commentary and a review, and in it, he revealed that this was about

19:57.080 --> 19:59.160
more than just the scientific facts.

19:59.160 --> 20:00.160
Dahl wrote,

20:00.880 --> 20:12.320
My social life is plagued by people who think I am against their eating salt.

20:12.320 --> 20:17.560
I am convinced that adding salt is bad, but I do not believe that it is a sin.

20:17.560 --> 20:21.400
I noticed something when reading Dahl's papers.

20:21.400 --> 20:29.000
He had a repulsion for adding salt, the literal action of adding salt to a meal.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.880
It clearly bothered him.

20:30.880 --> 20:34.600
In his earlier work, he came up with the idea to classify people in groups depending on

20:34.600 --> 20:37.040
if they added salt to their meal or not.

20:37.040 --> 20:41.320
Those who added salt without tasting food were classified as high intake.

20:41.320 --> 20:45.680
Now this is a hilariously fallible way to classify people, and Dahl would acknowledge

20:45.680 --> 20:50.400
that, but what this does is it unmasks the theory that Dahl is driven by.

20:50.400 --> 20:54.720
The salt that is present naturally in a food is all that is necessary.

20:54.720 --> 20:58.000
Any salt added after that is bad.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.960
That's right, completely unsalted meals for the king of salt reduction in America.

21:01.960 --> 21:06.000
He will stand at 10 toes down, you couldn't shove him off his position if you were coming

21:06.000 --> 21:08.800
in at 6'5 and 280 pounds.

21:08.800 --> 21:09.800
As he wrote,

21:17.320 --> 21:18.320
What?

21:18.320 --> 21:23.520
In other words, Dahl was saying that he believed his conclusion to be true regardless of any

21:23.520 --> 21:26.080
evidence you brought to his table to say otherwise.

21:26.080 --> 21:32.240
And uh oh, Dahl's immovable position seemed to have rubbed off on the government.

21:32.240 --> 21:36.800
You see, we may think that we have lower sodium options at the grocery store because the public

21:36.800 --> 21:43.200
spoke out and demanded better lower salt options or else, but no, that didn't happen.

21:43.200 --> 21:48.800
Low salt labels aren't a result of the public's cry out, but a direct result of the government's

21:48.800 --> 21:50.400
numerous initiatives.

21:50.400 --> 21:54.400
You see, it wasn't just the WHO or just the NHLBI.

21:54.400 --> 21:57.760
After that 1969 meeting, everyone got involved.

21:57.760 --> 22:03.820
The USDA, FDA, ADA, AHA, AMA, NBA, I mean the list goes on.

22:03.820 --> 22:07.080
Agencies comprised of scientists, doctors, health professionals, agencies I'd never

22:07.080 --> 22:08.920
heard of, the media got involved.

22:08.920 --> 22:13.540
This was a nationwide effort from every relevant corner of the entire government.

22:13.540 --> 22:20.200
The government tasked food industries to emphasize low sodium labeling and to make more low sodium

22:20.200 --> 22:21.200
options.

22:21.200 --> 22:25.320
Low salt labeling started to appear in grocery stores all across America.

22:25.320 --> 22:30.640
This is one of the most grand dietary movements to ever take place in the United States.

22:30.640 --> 22:35.800
Okay, so back to thinking about our thoughts.

22:35.800 --> 22:38.440
We didn't get this from staying hip to the latest research.

22:38.440 --> 22:43.360
Most of us had no idea what was going on in the 70s, but all of us have been in the grocery

22:43.360 --> 22:44.360
store.

22:44.360 --> 22:48.320
When you see a food and you see the low salt alternative, you cannot avoid the thought

22:48.320 --> 22:51.600
that this ingredient cannot be good for me.

22:51.600 --> 22:56.300
Now, multiply this by the media influence on the topic, multiply this by what your friends

22:56.300 --> 23:01.000
and family say about salt, and we may not have paid attention to it, but most of us

23:01.000 --> 23:03.880
have subliminally villainized salt.

23:03.880 --> 23:05.560
You see, we have the order all wrong.

23:05.560 --> 23:11.240
The research started it all, which then influenced the government, which then charged food industries,

23:11.240 --> 23:13.880
which then influenced us.

23:13.880 --> 23:17.560
The problem here is the same problem that we've been having for decades.

23:17.560 --> 23:19.560
Where is the influence coming from?

23:19.560 --> 23:20.560
There's two options.

23:20.560 --> 23:23.520
In TOPS, who I mentioned earlier, I think he hit the nail on the head.

23:23.520 --> 23:26.520
Public health policy versus good science.

23:26.520 --> 23:29.080
Two behemoths, Godzilla versus King Kong.

23:29.080 --> 23:33.400
TOPS also quoted Drum and Rini, an esteemed nephrologist who says, you can say without

23:33.400 --> 23:38.680
a shadow of a doubt that NHLBI has made a commitment to salt education that goes way

23:38.680 --> 23:40.640
beyond the scientific facts.

23:40.640 --> 23:42.920
So Godzilla might be cheating a little bit.

23:42.920 --> 23:49.240
The government going beyond the scope of facts to make policy sounds shady, right?

23:49.240 --> 23:54.840
Any time there's a gap between the government doing something and why the government is

23:54.840 --> 23:58.280
doing something, it's very tempting to want to bridge it.

23:58.280 --> 24:02.080
Any attempt to bridge this gap is going to come off as conspiratorial.

24:02.080 --> 24:06.280
If anything like me, you kind of check out when things become all about conspiracy.

24:06.280 --> 24:10.920
They may serve a function somewhere, but in general, they kind of leave you cynical versus

24:10.920 --> 24:11.920
empowered.

24:11.920 --> 24:13.960
All masters will only have two things left to do.

24:13.960 --> 24:15.920
We got to get down to dirty with the biology.

24:15.920 --> 24:19.480
What's actually taking place in the body between sodium and blood pressure?

24:19.480 --> 24:23.920
Then we got to look at the science, the big picture, and come up with a salty verdict.

24:23.920 --> 24:25.920
Hey, fun fact.

24:25.920 --> 24:30.280
Did you know I make these videos all on my own, completely independent?

24:30.280 --> 24:33.360
And I'm not saying that for any reason other than the fact that I've read that some of

24:33.360 --> 24:35.480
you guys think that I have a team.

24:35.480 --> 24:36.480
I don't.

24:36.480 --> 24:38.000
It's just me.

24:38.000 --> 24:43.280
But I do have my supporters, you guys, and we still haven't come up with a community

24:43.280 --> 24:47.160
name, but I think we're onto something with this hat.

24:47.160 --> 24:48.160
It's yours.

24:48.160 --> 24:49.160
It's available to you.

24:49.160 --> 24:50.240
Check it out in the below.

24:50.240 --> 24:51.240
In the below.

24:51.240 --> 24:52.600
I almost had it one take.

24:52.600 --> 24:55.080
Check it out in the link in the description.

24:55.080 --> 24:59.520
Sodium and hypertension, a large part driving the confusion behind the topic, is the question

24:59.520 --> 25:00.520
of how.

25:00.520 --> 25:02.640
If sodium is affecting blood pressure, then how?

25:02.640 --> 25:04.440
What mechanisms are at play here?

25:04.440 --> 25:08.560
As this review states, pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to increased blood pressure values

25:08.560 --> 25:12.400
have been long time debated and have not yet been completely elucidated.

25:12.400 --> 25:16.800
In other words, the connection between sodium and blood pressure is an intricate one, and

25:16.800 --> 25:22.200
no one has been able to say with 100% certainty that they know exactly what's going on here.

25:22.200 --> 25:25.360
There are really three theories we're going to go over here, and it may be time to sit

25:25.360 --> 25:29.720
up and lean in because this first one is packed with stuff we got to talk about.

25:29.720 --> 25:33.680
Most folks, including a lot of scientists, believe in this first theory, and that is

25:33.680 --> 25:35.840
the water retention theory.

25:35.840 --> 25:37.280
We know sodium as an electrolyte.

25:37.280 --> 25:41.160
We know a trait of electrolytes is that where they go, water follows.

25:41.160 --> 25:46.160
With this, we can assume that an increase of sodium leads to a retention of sodium,

25:46.160 --> 25:48.640
which leads to a retention of water.

25:48.640 --> 25:52.960
The kidney is only letting out so much free water as it wants to keep some, so we aren't

25:52.960 --> 25:54.520
too soft concentrated.

25:54.520 --> 25:58.800
We end up reaching this steady water retained state.

25:58.800 --> 26:03.880
More water means increased blood value, and increased blood value means increased blood

26:03.880 --> 26:04.880
pressure.

26:04.880 --> 26:09.000
Okay, can anybody guess where this theory can go wrong?

26:09.000 --> 26:11.880
The answer isn't right in our face, and actually we have to zoom in a little bit.

26:11.880 --> 26:16.720
A group of researchers were in a lab studying six healthy nonhypertensive men and gave them

26:16.720 --> 26:21.480
increasingly more salt over the course of 24 days with the intentions of measuring something

26:21.480 --> 26:23.920
totally unrelated to the subject at hand.

26:23.920 --> 26:28.080
But their procedure led them to accidentally discover something that they weren't expecting.

26:28.080 --> 26:33.040
They found that an increase of sodium did not lead to an increase of the body's water,

26:33.040 --> 26:35.160
but a shift in the body's water.

26:35.160 --> 26:40.120
The finding was so exciting that they did another study to focus on just that finding.

26:40.120 --> 26:42.040
They performed a randomized control trial.

26:42.040 --> 26:44.360
We got ourselves a gold batch.

26:44.360 --> 26:49.800
They took 32 healthy nonhypertensive men and split them into four groups to be fed different

26:49.800 --> 26:51.960
amounts of salt over seven days.

26:51.960 --> 26:57.640
One group at 1,500 milligrams of salt, one at 6,000, one at 12,100, and finally, one

26:57.640 --> 26:59.600
at 16,700.

26:59.600 --> 27:01.960
Enough salt to make Louis Ketchum the doll sit up in his grave.

27:01.960 --> 27:03.600
What they found was remarkable.

27:03.600 --> 27:09.160
There was no water retention effect.

27:09.160 --> 27:11.200
No water retention effect.

27:11.200 --> 27:15.200
You hear that voice switch up, mess around, drop a podcast on y'all, change the game up.

27:15.200 --> 27:19.160
Listen, if you really want to understand the weight of these researchers' results, and

27:19.160 --> 27:23.600
not only that, but the actual relationship between salt and blood pressure, we do have

27:23.600 --> 27:25.400
to go a little deeper.

27:25.400 --> 27:30.000
And if you're anything like me, once you start to go a little deep, you kind of lose it.

27:30.000 --> 27:34.640
So I heard that if you hit the like button, that increases your chances of understanding

27:34.640 --> 27:37.880
by like 15%.

27:37.880 --> 27:40.040
Don't be the person to not find out.

27:40.040 --> 27:43.040
Intracellular water is the water that resides inside of ourselves.

27:43.040 --> 27:47.960
There's a lot of places for the body to put water other than inside of ourselves, so extracellular

27:47.960 --> 27:53.400
water, water outside of ourselves, has to be compartmentalized to smaller subcompartments.

27:53.400 --> 27:56.440
One is intravascular water, the water within our blood vessels.

27:56.440 --> 27:59.720
The other is interstitial water, the water running in between everything.

27:59.720 --> 28:04.200
What these researchers found was that the intravascular fluid volume was the fluid compartment that

28:04.200 --> 28:09.400
increased after salt loading, and somehow, extracellular fluid volume was unaffected.

28:09.400 --> 28:13.440
Now, when I say I was befuddled reading this, I was absolutely befuddled.

28:13.440 --> 28:18.840
How can something that is within something increase in volume, but the whole entire thing

28:18.840 --> 28:19.840
doesn't increase in volume?

28:19.840 --> 28:23.440
If we picture this out, it's like having one big balloon, and inside of it are two

28:23.440 --> 28:24.680
smaller balloons.

28:24.680 --> 28:28.680
One of them increases in volume, but the big balloon's volume doesn't change.

28:28.680 --> 28:29.680
How can this happen?

28:29.680 --> 28:34.420
Well, the researchers found there was a shift of the interstitial fluid into the intravascular

28:34.420 --> 28:37.760
fluid, like one little balloon giving air to the other.

28:37.760 --> 28:41.840
The researchers also found this experiment to have no effect on the participant's blood

28:41.840 --> 28:43.320
pressure throughout the study.

28:43.320 --> 28:44.800
How?

28:44.800 --> 28:49.760
Intravascular fluid increased, which means blood volume increased, which means blood pressure

28:49.760 --> 28:51.640
should increase, right?

28:51.640 --> 28:56.560
The researchers mentioned after a high salt mill, the blood volume is going to increase.

28:56.560 --> 29:00.600
It seems for healthy individuals, this effect is temporary, or what we call transient.

29:00.600 --> 29:04.480
As the researchers noted, this increased blood volume lasted for only an hour or two.

29:04.480 --> 29:06.200
This is me saying this, not them.

29:06.200 --> 29:10.760
I believe they didn't find an effect on blood pressure because it's not like the

29:10.760 --> 29:14.480
blood pressure never budged during the study, but they said that they measured it in the

29:14.480 --> 29:21.760
morning, not directly after salt loading, which would mean that the participant's underlying

29:21.760 --> 29:24.920
blood pressure throughout the entire study was unaffected.

29:24.920 --> 29:30.920
I told you to lean in and buckle up.

29:30.920 --> 29:36.960
Now how can the body hold more sodium, yet not retain a corresponding amount of water?

29:36.960 --> 29:42.040
This was hinted at a non-osmolar storage of sodium, meaning sodium in the body that is

29:42.040 --> 29:43.880
not impacting water balance.

29:43.880 --> 29:45.840
This is absolutely buck wild.

29:45.840 --> 29:47.960
This ninja sodium in the body.

29:47.960 --> 29:52.120
If we dove deeper into this, we'd be steering way off of the course of this video, but we're

29:52.120 --> 29:57.000
starting to enter the territory of understanding just how complex this relationship between

29:57.000 --> 29:59.640
sodium and blood pressure actually is.

29:59.640 --> 30:01.800
This isn't the only research paper that shakes things up.

30:01.800 --> 30:06.280
We're learning and discovering that sodium handling, how the body handles sodium, it's

30:06.600 --> 30:08.440
much more dynamic than what we thought.

30:08.440 --> 30:14.120
Theory number two is a popular theory introduced by scientists named Guyton in 1991, explained

30:14.120 --> 30:19.320
that the kidney and its related system is really the judge of if we undergo high blood pressure

30:19.320 --> 30:21.280
from excess salt or not.

30:21.280 --> 30:25.000
The kidney is closely intertwined with hormones, enzymes, and other little things that tightly

30:25.000 --> 30:29.120
regulate fluid balance, the tightening and widening of blood vessels, as well as blood

30:29.120 --> 30:30.280
pressure overall.

30:30.280 --> 30:33.920
To keep things simple, we'll refer to this as the kidney fluid system.

30:33.920 --> 30:38.040
The kidney fluid system is one of the systems in charge of keeping the body in homeostasis,

30:38.040 --> 30:41.200
a.k.a. a state of physiological balance.

30:41.200 --> 30:43.080
The Guyton theory goes as follows.

30:43.080 --> 30:47.240
Increased salt results in increased thirst, increased thirst results in increased water

30:47.240 --> 30:48.640
drinking to balance it out.

30:48.640 --> 30:53.440
This increase in body fluid leads to increased volume of the blood, which then increases

30:53.440 --> 30:54.640
blood pressure.

30:54.640 --> 30:59.760
He says as long as the kidney fluid system functions normally, we can eat either extremely

30:59.760 --> 31:05.360
small amounts of salt or as much as 50 times as much without a major alteration in blood

31:05.360 --> 31:06.480
pressure.

31:06.480 --> 31:11.160
By this theory, regarding blood pressure, a person's salt sensitivity could be determined

31:11.160 --> 31:16.360
by how much of a bottleneck or a handicap a person's kidney fluid system is.

31:16.360 --> 31:20.600
In a sense that if a person's kidney cannot pee out enough sodium to keep things balanced

31:20.600 --> 31:27.040
without sufficiently raising the blood pressure, then that person is more salt sensitive.

31:27.320 --> 31:31.080
Now, the Guyton theory is one of the most recognized theories there is, but it is not

31:31.080 --> 31:33.120
the walk-off home run answer.

31:33.120 --> 31:34.920
There's still a lot of nuance going on here.

31:34.920 --> 31:37.320
Theory number three isn't really much of a theory.

31:37.320 --> 31:41.080
It's just an excuse for me to bring up the sympathetic nervous system because our nervous

31:41.080 --> 31:44.960
system is all up in the mix of this relationship with sodium and blood pressure.

31:44.960 --> 31:49.000
The sympathetic nervous system is in charge of our fight or flight mode, the mode that

31:49.000 --> 31:52.240
activates when we're stressed, in danger, or highly active.

31:52.240 --> 31:55.440
This mode is always on just in varying degrees.

31:55.440 --> 31:59.280
Its activity is hiding when you're getting ready to skydive out of a plane, and its activity

31:59.280 --> 32:02.680
is lessened when you're winding down with some bedside reading.

32:02.680 --> 32:07.880
The sympathetic nervous system is the major system behind our blood pressure responses.

32:07.880 --> 32:12.520
This study on lab rats found that after a high salt regimen, it wasn't the salt itself

32:12.520 --> 32:17.120
that increased blood pressure, but an over-activation of the sympathetic nervous system that made

32:17.120 --> 32:19.920
the rats more sensitive to the salt.

32:19.920 --> 32:23.400
Another rat study, I mean take it how you want, but I could not possibly create this

32:23.400 --> 32:28.040
video without mentioning the sympathetic nervous system, which quick tip we can directly

32:28.040 --> 32:30.560
influence by breathing.

32:30.560 --> 32:35.440
I always say there's a reason we are designed to control what is otherwise automatic in

32:35.440 --> 32:36.440
breathing.

32:36.440 --> 32:39.920
Again, not going too deep here, but I want us to get into the headspace of what all is

32:39.920 --> 32:40.920
going into this.

32:40.920 --> 32:44.040
There's a reason you never heard of how salt and blood pressure are connected because

32:44.040 --> 32:48.760
how can we even explain it in just a few sentences, but there is something going on.

32:48.760 --> 32:51.960
It just isn't as linear as 1, 2, 3, ABC.

32:51.960 --> 32:57.680
It's more like 1, 2 percent sign X of left, down, down, right.

32:57.680 --> 33:05.280
Now we have to ask the question, if the connection between salt and blood pressure is so not

33:05.280 --> 33:10.320
straightforward, then why are our instructions so straightforward?

33:10.320 --> 33:12.080
Reduce your salt intake.

33:12.080 --> 33:17.320
With one of the most cited recommendations being the WHO, less than 2,000 milligrams

33:17.320 --> 33:19.880
of sodium, that's 5 grams of salt.

33:19.880 --> 33:23.280
That's about this much.

33:23.280 --> 33:25.200
Not a salty pebble more.

33:25.200 --> 33:26.200
That's it.

33:26.200 --> 33:30.000
I may have an unpopular opinion here, but I don't think there's anything inherently

33:30.000 --> 33:36.200
wrong with the prescription of less than 2,000 milligrams, however I do believe it's enormously

33:36.200 --> 33:43.960
irresponsible for myself, the government, or anyone to dub 2,000 as the magic number.

33:43.960 --> 33:48.840
The idea that we could fit every single body on the same less than 2,000 milligrams boat

33:48.880 --> 33:54.280
and happily ship that salty sucker off smooth sailing down the river is ridiculous.

33:54.280 --> 33:58.560
All right, I gotta clean up all the salt that I spilled on the floor.

33:58.560 --> 34:02.600
The salt saga is just like running the 400 meter hurdle race.

34:02.600 --> 34:05.240
There is barrier after barrier after barrier.

34:05.240 --> 34:10.360
If we want to get the answers that we want, then we gotta traverse over these hurdles.

34:10.360 --> 34:11.360
What are these hurdles?

34:11.360 --> 34:15.640
Well, it's the research, it's kind of bad, and it's getting in the way.

34:15.640 --> 34:17.960
Let's zoom out and understand the scope of the issue.

34:18.680 --> 34:19.680
Blood pressure.

34:19.680 --> 34:20.680
The goal?

34:20.680 --> 34:23.520
Figure out if and how they're connected.

34:23.520 --> 34:24.720
How can we go about this?

34:24.720 --> 34:26.880
We have two options, really.

34:26.880 --> 34:28.840
Observational studies and interventional studies.

34:28.840 --> 34:31.160
In observational studies, we're looking at a population.

34:31.160 --> 34:35.200
We assess their salt intake, we assess their blood pressure, and boom, we have our results.

34:35.200 --> 34:38.040
There are different ways to go about this, and each method yielding different levels

34:38.040 --> 34:39.760
of quality in the results.

34:39.760 --> 34:42.080
We can do a 24-hour recall.

34:42.080 --> 34:49.360
Hey, population of people, us scientists, are time to figure out how much sodium you

34:49.360 --> 34:50.360
consume.

34:50.360 --> 34:56.360
Please tell us what you've eaten over the last 24 hours.

34:56.360 --> 35:00.040
Most of us hardly remember what we had just a few hours ago for breakfast.

35:00.040 --> 35:05.560
Not to mention, this method only captures one day, and unless the entire population

35:05.560 --> 35:11.920
of people is the type to sling together the same ham sandwich every single day for lunch,

35:11.920 --> 35:13.720
then one day just won't cut it.

35:13.720 --> 35:16.000
24-hour recall, try it.

35:16.000 --> 35:24.280
We could do food records.

35:24.280 --> 35:28.200
This is prone to bias, and it's hard to get a large group of people to adhere to this

35:28.200 --> 35:31.240
method, especially if you don't have them gathered up in the laboratory.

35:31.240 --> 35:35.520
Food records, better than 24-hour recall, but still garbage.

35:35.520 --> 35:48.360
What about a food frequency questionnaire?

35:48.360 --> 35:52.160
This method has similar issues as the past two, plus it's not specific enough.

35:52.160 --> 35:59.360
So food frequency questionnaire, the best method to measure sodium in an observational study

35:59.360 --> 36:02.800
would have to be collecting pee.

36:02.800 --> 36:10.000
Not from just one urine sample, not from just a few urine samples over eight hours,

36:10.000 --> 36:17.360
but it's going to have to be the gold standard of collecting multiple consecutive 24-hour

36:17.360 --> 36:18.960
pee tests.

36:18.960 --> 36:23.360
That's the only way to get an accurate snapshot of a person's sodium intake.

36:23.360 --> 36:28.120
Okay, I'm being a little facetious when I call the research straight up bad, but I want

36:28.120 --> 36:32.720
us to understand the challenge that we've been facing and continue to face.

36:32.720 --> 36:39.320
Sodium varies way too much day to day to do anything other than multiple 24-hour pee

36:39.320 --> 36:40.320
tests.

36:40.320 --> 36:44.880
However, these tests are very difficult to orchestrate.

36:44.880 --> 36:48.680
Imagine being in one of these studies and you were tasked to have every single urine

36:48.680 --> 36:51.280
episode collected for two to three days.

36:51.280 --> 36:54.680
When it comes to observational studies, the harder something is for scientists and the

36:54.680 --> 36:58.360
population to carry out, the less people the study will have.

36:58.360 --> 37:00.360
The easier it is for everyone, the more people.

37:00.360 --> 37:04.760
So we're choosing between what we want, a high volume of folks at the expense of accuracy

37:04.760 --> 37:08.400
or high accuracy at the expense of the amount of folks.

37:08.400 --> 37:12.720
The American Heart Association put out an article just about how many chances there

37:12.720 --> 37:16.080
are for a large observational study to go wrong.

37:16.080 --> 37:20.040
What if there are participants who were instructed by their doctor to reduce sodium or they're

37:20.040 --> 37:21.360
on blood pressure meds?

37:21.360 --> 37:24.360
What if some folks are sick or have pre-existing conditions?

37:24.360 --> 37:27.280
What about confounding factors like age, sex, race, or smoking?

37:27.280 --> 37:31.560
The imbalance, too many people, too far apart in age or race, what if the researchers suck

37:31.560 --> 37:32.560
at following up?

37:32.560 --> 37:35.760
I mean, the list goes on and on, but now that we have a solid understanding of the plight

37:35.760 --> 37:38.400
of observational studies, let's overview interventional.

37:38.400 --> 37:42.920
And short interventional studies are just when the researchers do something, they intervene

37:42.920 --> 37:44.160
with the subjects.

37:44.160 --> 37:45.520
They typically look like this.

37:45.520 --> 37:49.760
We split subjects up into two or more groups, we give subjects different levels of salt,

37:49.760 --> 37:52.480
and we measure their blood pressure responses.

37:52.480 --> 37:57.040
Interventional studies have a spectrum of quality as well, but are miles ahead of observational

37:57.040 --> 38:02.120
studies in terms of the value that we get because of the level of control that the researchers

38:02.120 --> 38:03.120
get.

38:03.120 --> 38:06.520
We can be extremely picky over the exact avatar of a person we want to measure.

38:06.520 --> 38:08.560
We can keep folks in a lab for a few days.

38:08.560 --> 38:10.200
We can feed exact amounts of sodium.

38:10.200 --> 38:13.320
We can randomize participants, blind them to what we're measuring.

38:13.320 --> 38:15.900
We can have a control group to balance out results.

38:15.900 --> 38:17.400
We have control.

38:17.400 --> 38:22.880
Now, interventional studies aren't completely free of biases and other error, but they are

38:22.880 --> 38:28.540
the reason that in general, the scientific community does agree that reducing sodium

38:28.540 --> 38:30.560
can reduce blood pressure.

38:30.560 --> 38:33.440
And that leads us perfectly into this next one.

38:33.440 --> 38:40.400
After 120 years of measuring salt and blood pressure, what do we agree on?

38:40.400 --> 38:41.400
Three things.

38:41.400 --> 38:45.320
Number one, the scientific community generally agrees this is hard.

38:45.320 --> 38:49.080
It's really hard to get the number of how much sodium.

38:49.080 --> 38:53.480
The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, or NASM, is a non-governmental

38:53.480 --> 38:54.840
independent organization.

38:54.840 --> 38:58.600
The nutritional arm of this organization are the folks who come up with dietary reference

38:58.600 --> 38:59.600
intakes.

38:59.600 --> 39:02.560
Information the public receives on how much of stuff we should be consuming.

39:02.560 --> 39:06.760
For example, this amount of vitamin A will cover the ground for a majority of healthy

39:06.760 --> 39:07.760
folks.

39:07.760 --> 39:10.320
This amount of vitamin A is probably pushing it.

39:10.320 --> 39:14.320
When they can't come up with these exact numbers, they pull out what they call the adequate

39:14.320 --> 39:19.040
intake number, which is used to basically say, hey, you need at least this much.

39:19.040 --> 39:21.560
There ain't enough evidence to come up with anything else.

39:21.560 --> 39:22.560
And you guessed it.

39:22.560 --> 39:26.400
I looked at the sodium report and I haven't seen the words insufficient evidence repeated

39:26.400 --> 39:28.120
more than anything I've ever read.

39:28.120 --> 39:30.080
So they have to come up with this adequate intake number.

39:30.080 --> 39:33.000
And in order to do this, they have to look at sodium balance.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
Sodium balance.

39:34.000 --> 39:37.920
If we can measure every molecule of sodium entering and leaving someone, we may be able

39:37.920 --> 39:41.600
to get a good idea of how much is physiologically needed.

39:41.600 --> 39:45.880
This is so incredibly hard to do that NASM mentioned only two studies were able to pull

39:45.880 --> 39:48.960
it off and they said only one was rigorous enough.

39:48.960 --> 39:54.040
In the end, NASM came up with the adequate intake number of 1500 milligrams.

39:54.040 --> 39:58.800
But the number doesn't matter as much as why they state these numbers are so hard to come

39:58.800 --> 39:59.800
up with.

39:59.800 --> 40:02.200
Secretration and infradient rhythm.

40:02.200 --> 40:04.040
What language am I speaking?

40:04.040 --> 40:10.720
NASM pointed out these two things as another factor, not only widening the difference between

40:10.720 --> 40:16.800
an individual and a separate individual, but the difference between an individual and himself.

40:16.800 --> 40:21.480
Secretion refers to sodium storage in the body that isn't subject to excretion.

40:21.480 --> 40:25.920
So in the same way that we stash our piggy banks in the top left corner of our closets,

40:25.920 --> 40:29.440
there's emerging evidence that our body does this as well with sodium.

40:29.440 --> 40:33.880
Infradient rhythm refers to how sodium handling in the body isn't subject to circadian rhythm.

40:33.880 --> 40:35.640
Like our hormones are, for example.

40:35.640 --> 40:40.000
What the body does with sodium within 24 hours may be miles away from what it will do in

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
the next.

40:41.000 --> 40:44.280
Agreement number two, we're going to pull out a review published in 2020 that highlighted

40:44.280 --> 40:46.680
areas of agreement for my own personal convenience.

40:46.680 --> 40:51.240
There's general agreement that reducing sodium intake reduces blood pressure, especially

40:51.240 --> 40:55.800
in people with hypertension, especially in people with hypertension.

40:55.800 --> 40:59.440
An important note, I wanted to highlight something that was said in another review.

40:59.440 --> 41:03.680
More studies have confirmed the benefit of reducing sodium intake in hypertensive subjects

41:03.680 --> 41:04.680
with a high salt intake.

41:04.680 --> 41:10.800
It is unclear whether the remaining more than 90% of the population will profit from a dietary

41:10.800 --> 41:12.160
sodium restriction.

41:12.160 --> 41:17.360
It would perhaps be more correct to start discussing inappropriate rather than excessive

41:17.360 --> 41:18.360
salt intake.

41:18.360 --> 41:23.040
Thirdly, the scientific community also generally agrees that high sodium intake is deleterious.

41:23.040 --> 41:27.520
The review went on to say, mortality from cardiovascular disease increased at the highest

41:27.520 --> 41:31.720
levels of sodium consumption, noting over 5,000 milligrams.

41:31.720 --> 41:33.200
Mortality referring to the rate of death.

41:33.200 --> 41:37.160
We want mortality to be low, and now is actually the perfect time to hop right into it.

41:37.160 --> 41:38.720
Let's not wait a moment further.

41:38.720 --> 41:41.040
We're going to discuss the big picture.

41:41.040 --> 41:44.600
We're talking about salt and blood pressure.

41:44.600 --> 41:50.600
We are using blood pressure as the risk factor, meaning an increased blood pressure equals

41:50.600 --> 41:52.640
an increased risk.

41:52.640 --> 41:54.640
Increased risk of what?

41:54.640 --> 41:55.640
Cardiovascular disease.

41:55.640 --> 42:02.560
This lives under the assumption that an increased blood pressure can eventually lead to cardiovascular

42:02.560 --> 42:03.560
disease.

42:03.560 --> 42:05.720
So high blood pressure isn't the problem.

42:05.720 --> 42:11.320
Now saying it isn't a problem, but it is one of the handful of things that is indicative

42:11.320 --> 42:15.760
of an individual who may suffer from a cardiovascular disease.

42:15.760 --> 42:18.240
Can high sodium increase blood pressure?

42:18.240 --> 42:20.280
Yes, we've learned that.

42:20.280 --> 42:24.840
Does high sodium increase blood pressure in every person every time?

42:24.840 --> 42:26.120
No, it does not.

42:26.120 --> 42:27.240
We've learned that.

42:27.240 --> 42:29.720
Sodium has a relationship with blood pressure.

42:29.720 --> 42:33.560
Its relationship is not linear for everyone across the board.

42:33.560 --> 42:37.360
Sodium is also not the only factor modulating blood pressure.

42:37.360 --> 42:44.080
So sodium cannot be the sole reason we would develop cardiovascular disease.

42:44.080 --> 42:45.080
Why do I bring this up?

42:45.080 --> 42:47.000
Because we've made it all about salt.

42:47.000 --> 42:51.680
But when we bring up the increased mortality rate of individuals consuming these levels

42:51.680 --> 42:57.320
of salt, we have to ask, where are they getting this salt from?

42:57.320 --> 43:03.200
450 adults, Alabama, California, and Minnesota, equal numbers of men and women from each

43:03.240 --> 43:07.480
ethnic group of blacks, Asians, Hispanics, and whites were assessed.

43:07.480 --> 43:16.040
They found that over 70% of the sodium consumed was from processed foods.

43:16.040 --> 43:20.400
I've read how high salt is linked to other diseases other than cardiovascular diseases,

43:20.400 --> 43:21.400
right?

43:21.400 --> 43:23.640
Like stomach cancer or kidney disease.

43:23.640 --> 43:27.480
But I mean, come on, I'd be shocked if it wasn't connected to these things considering

43:27.480 --> 43:31.480
that high salt is coming straight from the stuff that's been taking us out the whole

43:31.480 --> 43:32.480
time.

43:32.480 --> 43:34.080
So, what's the total of this ingredient list?

43:34.080 --> 43:35.280
Can you guess the food?

43:35.280 --> 43:39.080
So ingredient lists are ordered from what's present in the food in the highest amount

43:39.080 --> 43:40.720
to the lowest.

43:40.720 --> 43:42.880
Sugar is the first ingredient.

43:42.880 --> 43:48.840
Okay, so this was a bag of popcorn, but somehow popcorn ended up being the second ingredient?

43:48.840 --> 43:50.320
How do you even pull that off?

43:50.320 --> 43:54.800
How can knocking back stuff like this with loads of sugar, problematic oils, and miscellaneous

43:54.800 --> 43:59.160
synthetic stuff not be linked to various diseases?

43:59.160 --> 44:02.320
Okay, but what do we focus on sodium alone?

44:02.320 --> 44:07.520
Well, two handfuls of this stuff will net us somewhere around 160 milligrams of sodium.

44:07.520 --> 44:10.120
But this bag of popcorn is a pretty bad offender.

44:10.120 --> 44:11.120
What about this?

44:11.120 --> 44:13.360
A slice of sandwich bread.

44:13.360 --> 44:16.400
We're looking at about 130 milligrams of sodium.

44:16.400 --> 44:21.760
Perhaps with this we have a sausage, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich for breakfast.

44:21.760 --> 44:25.520
For lunch, we're having canned veggie soup with a turkey sami.

44:25.520 --> 44:29.440
The fam had spaghetti for dinner, but we weren't that hungry, so we only had a teeny bit along

44:29.440 --> 44:32.560
with a side salad with that hidden valley ranch.

44:32.560 --> 44:38.280
At the end of the day, we end up somewhere around 2,695 milligrams of sodium.

44:38.280 --> 44:42.880
This isn't an outrageous number by any means, but that's actually not the point.

44:42.880 --> 44:43.880
Look at it this way.

44:43.880 --> 44:50.480
Popular strawberry flavored breakfast bar, strawberry, potato chips, potato, canned tomato

44:50.480 --> 44:52.440
sauce, tomato.

44:52.440 --> 44:56.840
Naturally, whole foods ain't coming along with a lot of salty baggage.

44:56.840 --> 45:00.840
From the farm to your plate, who has more input on your food?

45:00.840 --> 45:02.440
You or the food industry?

45:02.440 --> 45:08.040
The more responsibility over our food we relinquish up to the food industry, the more

45:08.040 --> 45:10.360
salt our food will end up having.

45:10.360 --> 45:15.080
Some of the saltiest of the bunch being cured meats, canned items, and bread adds up as well.

45:15.080 --> 45:17.360
The food industry needs to add salt for a ton of reasons.

45:17.360 --> 45:20.960
Preservation, flavor helps with coloration, and even texture for some foods.

45:20.960 --> 45:22.880
Okay, don't get me wrong here y'all.

45:22.880 --> 45:26.800
It's not as if salt is the reason processed food is bad.

45:26.800 --> 45:29.640
Processed food has a lot to be desired.

45:29.640 --> 45:33.720
The problem is the same problem America has been facing from the jump.

45:33.720 --> 45:35.560
Too much.

45:35.560 --> 45:39.800
Most people ingest more salt than needed, but in the western world, this could be generalized

45:39.800 --> 45:43.640
to all minerals, vitamins, energy sources, and even water.

45:43.640 --> 45:45.240
Too many vitamins and minerals.

45:45.240 --> 45:46.240
What about this?

45:46.240 --> 45:50.040
Imagine the individual going through life on willy-nilly with their nutrition, ordering

45:50.040 --> 45:54.080
and eating out, take out, grab and go, handful it is, handful it at, leaving their food

45:54.080 --> 45:55.680
up to the will of the industry.

45:55.720 --> 45:59.920
Versus the nutritionally proactive individual who starts with whole foods, adding their

45:59.920 --> 46:01.720
own salt and going from there.

46:01.720 --> 46:05.320
The sodium intake difference between these two people would be massive.

46:05.320 --> 46:10.040
But even so, if we analyze the individual who is consuming these processed foods, this

46:10.040 --> 46:14.560
is the same individual who is less likely to have an exercise routine, is less likely

46:14.560 --> 46:19.880
to have a sleep routine, is less likely to have a de-stress routine, this person is less

46:19.880 --> 46:21.840
likely to be health conscious.

46:21.840 --> 46:26.440
You tell me, who is more likely to develop hypertension and cardiovascular disease?

46:26.440 --> 46:30.760
Salt isn't the problem as far as lifestyle is the problem.

46:34.760 --> 46:35.760
Wow.

46:35.760 --> 46:37.760
I mean, there's so much we couldn't even get to.

46:37.760 --> 46:41.920
Potassium, which is abundant in plant food, is kind of like the biological opposite of

46:41.920 --> 46:42.920
sodium.

46:42.920 --> 46:45.800
I didn't even mention some of the awesome functions of sodium, how it's a major player

46:45.800 --> 46:47.120
in our nervous system.

46:47.120 --> 46:49.760
I kind of think of sodium as the mineral of action.

46:49.760 --> 46:51.440
Without it, we'd be as stiff as a street light.

46:51.440 --> 46:55.720
I'm sure I'll see a comment about the inter-salt study of 88, one of the largest international

46:55.720 --> 46:57.280
studies ever done.

46:57.280 --> 47:00.600
Another seminal point to the salty saga, still questions to be answered.

47:00.600 --> 47:03.760
What about the sodium needs of a person that simply moves more?

47:03.760 --> 47:07.400
How do my sodium needs change as my life changes in season?

47:07.400 --> 47:11.160
You should be asking yourself, how did I get to this point in the video and not leave a

47:11.160 --> 47:12.160
like?

47:12.160 --> 47:13.160
Love you guys.

47:13.160 --> 47:14.160
Thanks so much.

47:14.160 --> 47:15.160
I hope you gained some insight and some perspective.

47:15.160 --> 47:16.160
I'm going to get a batch out of the way.
