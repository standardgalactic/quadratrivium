0	26400	Okay, so, what do you think?
26400	27560	It's salt.
27560	30560	But you and I both know it's more than that.
30560	33720	I mean, we could get into the technical size, but you just got here.
33720	35120	We'll do that later.
35120	38200	I'm more concerned about what you actually think.
38200	40600	Remember that recommendation to cut salt.
40600	41600	Salt.
41600	42600	Salt.
42600	43600	It has to be America's favorite flavoring.
43600	46360	You might say the extra ingredient is salt.
46360	47360	Put it in your medical study.
47360	48360	New study.
48360	49360	New study.
49360	52240	Recent study is shiny light on the amount of sodium Americans eat.
52240	53240	Slash salt.
53240	54240	Easier said than done.
54240	57040	This is one of those medical stories that people get confused about.
57040	60360	Number one risk for a diet-related death sodium.
60360	64280	Do you know the origin of your thoughts on salt?
64280	65280	For some of us, yes.
65280	67240	For the rest of us, think about it.
67240	68400	Think about your thoughts.
68400	69400	Thought-ception.
69400	73640	Because what if I told you what you believe or don't believe about salt was influenced
73640	76080	by something you never even considered?
76080	77080	Look around.
77080	78080	A standard American diet.
78080	79800	We didn't just wake up like this.
79800	85040	The research behind the food is how we ended up like this.
85040	86640	Welcome to No Lab Corp require.
86640	95560	My name is Johnny Cole Dixon and I swear we won't do the entire video like this.
95560	96560	Sodium has a reputation.
96560	98680	More accurately, it has an association.
98680	104560	How many times have you heard, I'm limiting my salt, I'm watching over my blood pressure?
104560	109280	Right now is probably the best time to mention that sodium and salt are not the same thing.
109280	111480	We get the two mixed up and it's perfectly fine.
111480	112480	It's okay.
112480	113480	It happens.
113480	116320	Even in the sacred world of academia, I've seen a research paper making this mistake.
117320	119760	Sodium is an ingredient of salt.
119760	122800	If you take a pinch of salt, only 40% is sodium.
122800	124840	The rest of it is chloride.
124840	127840	The other ingredient needed to make salt.
127840	128840	Okay.
128840	129840	Editing Johnny here.
129840	130840	I know.
130840	131840	Back to back interruptions.
131840	132840	That's crazy.
132840	137240	But now is probably also the best time to mention that I want this to be relevant for you.
137240	139880	So we're talking about blood pressure, but why does this matter?
139880	144120	Well, blood pressure is what we know as a precursor, meaning it comes before the main
144120	145120	thing.
145120	147920	The only thing we really want to avoid is the number one disease in the world, heart
147920	151760	disease or cardiovascular disease, some form of fashion, just like if you wanted to graduate
151760	154040	top of your class, that doesn't just happen.
154040	155320	There has to be a precursor.
155320	157080	Something has to take place prior.
157080	158080	What will have to take place?
158080	160200	You'd have to study a lot.
160200	161280	Salt and blood pressure.
161280	163200	Where did this association come from?
163200	165200	Is it valid or invalid?
165200	167340	How does this work in the body physically speaking?
167340	168640	How much sodium do I need?
168640	169640	So many questions.
169640	170640	Adventure awaits.
170640	171640	Let's hop in.
171640	176760	Self-organization put out a publication in March of 2023, a big old document on sodium
176760	178520	intake reduction.
178520	180720	Because as they state, the evidence is clear.
180720	185840	The more sodium we consume, the more our blood pressure rises and blood pressure is reduced
185840	188680	when dietary sodium intake is reduced.
188680	193800	Reducing sodium intake is one of the most cost effective ways to improve health.
193800	194800	Dang.
194800	195800	Poor sodium.
195800	197880	It ain't got a lot going for it right now.
197880	202320	So according to the WHO, the answer is as straightforward as an error.
202320	206800	Real quick, because I brought up the WHO, it always seems that health communicators are
206800	208960	at odds with these big entities, right?
208960	210720	WHO, FDA, USDA.
210720	214240	It must be because they're corrupted and want to profit off of everything with two
214240	216920	legs.
216920	217920	Not entirely.
217920	218920	Look at it this way.
218920	219920	Just entertain this with me.
219920	223720	Let's say you're getting a lecture from Professor Johnny about the sun.
223720	227280	Professor Johnny says the sun is great for plants, not for humans.
227280	230000	Put sunscreen on and stay in the shade if you know what's good for you.
230000	234520	You go to a different lecture where a separate professor, Professor Cole Dixon, is talking
234520	237920	about the sun as well, but his presentation is different.
237920	241880	He talks about the different rays the sun provides, vitamin D, melanin production, the
241880	245440	spectrum of extreme sun exposure to being a vampire.
245440	248360	What's the difference between these two professors?
248360	249360	Nuance.
249360	253040	You see, a lack of nuance raises three flags against a communicator.
253040	257640	Flag one, it seems they've ignored the blatantly obvious contrarian evidence.
257640	261240	Flag two, they're one-sided points just reek of bias.
261240	264880	Flag three, which is really just a result of flag one and two, is that they look like
264880	267200	they have an ulterior motive.
267200	272320	And turns out Professor Johnny was a sunscreen dealer, CEO of Sunny Johnny's sunscreen
272320	273320	enterprises.
273320	276560	Okay, let's go back to that WHO passage and highlight something.
276560	281000	The more sodium we consume, the more our blood pressure rises.
281000	282000	That's the messaging.
282000	283000	How do we get here?
283000	284000	Let's find out.
284000	290600	1904, where it all began.
290600	295240	This was the first study to report a positive correlation between salt intake and blood
295240	300080	pressure in humans.
300080	304800	Two French researchers gathered six patients and noticed an increase in salt intake was
304800	307520	associated with a rise of blood pressure.
307520	311320	Interestingly, the researchers also observed that some of the patient's blood pressure
311320	313880	barely budged after massive salt intake.
313880	318040	And the researchers wondered, perhaps there's an internal factor that modulates the blood
318040	319840	pressure from one person to another.
319840	325680	Possibly, what made these two groups have totally separate responses to high salt intake?
325680	326680	We'll get to this later.
326680	327680	This was a novel finding.
327680	332160	The French researchers were going to advance their field greatly from this one discovery.
332160	337400	But they were rebutted only three years later by a German researcher who opposed the findings
337400	338400	of the French.
338400	340560	He was skeptical of the salt blood pressure relationship.
340560	345200	He called out his French peers as wrong and labeled their experimentation as flawed.
345200	350560	There it was in early 1900s in black and white, two opposite findings, two opposing sides,
350560	353200	the pioneers and the skeptics.
353200	356960	Sounds like a good baseball game.
356960	360960	This is when the salty saga, the great debate, officially began.
360960	362760	You're given the options when you grocery shop.
362760	367520	You can get the regular item or you can get the item's low sodium cousin.
367520	371120	People read something like low sodium, light or less salt.
371120	374800	When food companies take an ingredient out, it's usually something we've all agreed
374800	377280	upon is generally not great for humans, right?
377280	378960	Like high fructose corn syrup.
378960	383280	But salt, as this academic commentary states, is the only essential component of mammals
383280	386000	to have obtained an unattractive status.
386000	391960	The world salt may have found its footing in the early 1900s, but it wasn't until 1960
391960	397120	when a man hailing from Long Island, New York, by the name Louis Kitchener Dahl, made everybody
397280	398280	pick a side.
398280	399280	Two studies.
399280	404240	Dahl published two studies, one in 1960 and one in 1962, which is like back to back in
404240	408200	scientific standards, two back to back albums, holding it down from the 60 to the 62.
408200	411800	These two studies are what many consider to be the seminal point.
411800	415120	This is when the salty saga really started to heat up.
415120	420200	Study number one, Dahl had been doing some observational work with salt intake and populations.
420200	423920	He traveled around the world with a small elite task force to perform a duty of the
423920	427000	utmost importance, collecting pee.
427000	431080	That's right, the 24 hour pee test is the gold standard for measuring a person's sodium
431080	432080	intake levels.
432080	434440	Over 90% of sodium is excreted through the kidney.
434440	438320	Considering you're healthy and didn't just come off of a mean game of Batman or an intense
438320	443480	game of chess, anything you'd sweat significantly because a collection of the last 24 hours
443480	446360	of your urine says a lot about where your sodium is at.
446360	451000	Dahl and his team collected data from the US, northern Japan, southern Japan, Marshall
451000	454480	Islanders, which is somewhere in the middle of the ocean, and finally Alaska.
454480	458120	The Alaskans average less than four grams of salt consumption, the Marshall Islanders
458120	462120	about seven grams, the Americans about 10, the southern Japanese 14, and the northern
462120	464280	Japanese 26 grams.
464280	467880	He then measured up these folks salt intake against the prevalence of high blood pressure,
467880	470080	which he indicated as 140 over 90.
470080	473080	I'm in an extremely uncomfortable position before we get into Dahl's results for my
473080	475800	folks who could use a little bit more insight on blood pressure.
475800	479840	The measurement of blood pressure is expressed by two numbers called systolic and diastolic.
479840	482280	Okay, sweet beans, what are the numbers actually telling us?
482280	485480	So when our blood travels throughout the body, it's being pressed up against the walls
485480	486480	of our blood vessels.
486480	489800	And I know that sounds a little violent, but our blood vessels are perfectly capable
489800	490800	of handling this.
490800	494400	When the heart is actively pumping blood, we get systolic pressure, the high number because
494400	495840	our blood just zoomed.
495840	498960	And between heartbeats, the heart's relaxed and we get diastolic pressure, the lower
498960	501360	number when the blood isn't zooming as much.
501360	507320	This is the only place where you can define blood pressure with the word zooming.
507320	508320	Stay in school.
508320	511000	Dahl's results, we get them in 1960 and you guessed it.
511000	515800	A near perfect correlation between sodium intake and prevalence of hypertension.
515800	519320	The more solid you ate, the higher your blood pressure.
519320	524200	Now Dahl's science here wasn't perfect and in fact to some it was considered negligible.
524200	528920	As this commentary states, there were no details given concerning the measures if any that
528920	531520	were used to avoid confounding and bias.
531520	534080	Now this is a really big deal and we actually have to talk about this.
534080	539520	A confounding factor is a variable that sneakily influences the outcome you're measuring.
539520	541160	We can stick with the topic on hand.
541160	546880	If we're measuring sodium and hypertension, a.k.a. chronically elevated blood pressure,
546880	550320	what are some things other than sodium that may contribute to that?
550320	553800	Well, we got stress, physical inactivity and we got age.
553800	556000	These would be our confounding factors.
556000	559560	Without proper action to account for these potential confounding factors influencing
559560	563320	our results, we end up with a inflated conclusion.
563320	568040	And if you're super slimy, you ignore confounding on purpose to give yourself leeway to say
568040	569840	there's a relationship between two things.
569840	573560	It's the difference between rolling a strike with the kitty railing up versus the kitty
573560	574560	railing down.
574560	578080	A kid may think his accuracy is all that, but he didn't account for the fact that the
578080	580920	kitty railing greatly influenced his outcome.
580920	582400	He would have been guttering it up.
582400	583400	It's based on a true story.
583400	585400	I was a kid.
585400	589360	Now we can pick apart Dahl's research all day and there's been plenty of old researches
589360	590440	to do just that.
590440	596040	But this first study wasn't important because of its findings, but because it showed Dahl's
596040	597520	beliefs about salt.
597520	600760	You see, Dahl's paper plainly revealed what side of the fence he was on when it came
600760	605160	to salt, categorizing it as a subtle lethal agent and putting it in the same light as
605160	609720	fallout and carcinogens, later comparing it to fat, cigarettes, and alcohol.
609720	612540	This was essentially Dahl's entry into the conversation, right?
612540	618400	This was Dahl arriving at the pool party, but this next study, the 1962 one, was like
618400	624480	him jumping into the pool, cannonballing and splashing everybody.
624480	625480	How'd you like that one?
625480	629520	Uh, I was not following.
629520	631320	Sounded pretty descriptive though.
631320	635040	Study number two, Dahl's 1962 study.
635040	639280	This would be the one to effectively change the way Americans ate.
639280	642740	Before we get into that, I did want to say that I thought I had a solid understanding
642740	646520	of how big of a deal this salt thing was.
646520	651800	Usually my research phase for a video can last anywhere from two days to two weeks.
651800	653920	This took much longer than that.
653920	659800	But rummaging through all of these old, salty research papers, I started to understand how
659800	662680	big of a deal this was when I came across this.
662680	664920	The Political Science of Salt.
664920	668680	Written by Gary Tovs, it illustrates the territory we're about to embark on.
668680	673560	The salt controversy constitutes one of the longest running, most vitriolic, and surreal
673560	675680	disputes in all of medicine.
675680	680200	On the one side are those experts who insist that the evidence that salt raises blood pressure
680200	682240	is effectively irrefutable.
682240	685960	On the other side are those researchers who argue that the data supporting universal salt
685960	688400	reduction have never been compelling.
688400	691040	You see, I wanted this video to be like flipping a coin, right?
691040	692320	We all just want one answer.
692320	693320	Believe me, I know.
693320	696920	How cautious, if at all, do we have to be over our salt intake?
696920	698400	Is that too much to ask?
698400	700560	It shouldn't be, but it is.
700560	701560	Why is that?
701560	703160	Well, there's two reasons.
703160	704760	One, we'll get to later.
704760	705760	It's scientific.
705760	707800	But this one, it's about ideology.
707800	712920	You see, the study that opened up the salt saga in 1904 was monumental because of new
712920	714120	revelation.
714120	717800	We learned that salt may have something to do with blood pressure.
717800	722360	As time passed, hypertension quickly became an area of high focus because it was recognized
722360	726680	as a precursor to the number one disease in the world, heart disease.
726680	728400	So many studies were done.
728400	729400	Money was poured in.
729400	730680	Resources were poured in.
730680	732200	We need answers.
732200	733200	And guess what?
733200	734200	We got them.
734200	739320	We started off so dang tribal about salt that it became less about the science and discovering
739320	741960	truth and more about picking a side.
741960	747080	The moment we pick a side is the moment we engage with science's greatest enemy, and
747080	749160	that is confirmation bias.
749160	753440	The mind under the veil of confirmation bias is so fascinating.
753440	758880	We become so fixated on the thing that we believe or are convinced of that we will go
758880	762760	to any length to prove that we're right, usually to ourselves.
762880	766480	Back with any evidence that says otherwise, it's either black or it's white.
766480	767760	There's no room for gray.
767760	772520	And ignoring nuance affords us the luxury of being right.
772520	775800	Bias can come from an agenda or it can come from straight up ego.
775800	777880	Either way, we've made an absolute mess.
777880	783080	Every government entity, every health communicator, every salty researcher has staked their position
783080	784680	and gave guidelines.
784680	789520	Either one, two, three, four, five, six or seven or eight grams of salt a day without
789520	791360	regarding the nuance.
791360	795320	And when we go deeper into the science in a bit here, we'll understand why this is
795320	797200	such a huge mistake we've been making.
797200	800920	So back to the Lewis Kitchener doll study of 1962, study number two.
800920	801920	What do we got?
801920	802920	We got rats.
802920	803920	Varmit.
803920	804920	Rodents.
804920	807200	Just, it's just rats.
807200	810760	Doll took 47 lab rats, just about half male and half female.
810760	815440	They were put on an 11.6% seesaw chow over the course of four weeks.
815440	817640	Observe something interesting.
817640	820120	Some rats were developing elevated blood pressure.
820120	821120	Some rats weren't.
821120	824760	The Zynga, he then went on a selective breeding spree.
824760	828240	Rats with the highest blood pressures were bred together and those with the lowest pressures
828240	829240	were bred together.
829240	833160	The kids of the high blood pressure parents were put on the same salty regimen and those
833160	836280	of them that developed the highest blood pressures were then bred again.
836280	837520	The rest were sent to lab rat heaven.
837520	840680	And then of course on the flip side, the same went for the kids of the low blood pressure
840680	841680	rats.
841680	843360	Can you call it offspring of rats kids?
843360	846720	Doll ended up with three generations of two separate groups of rats.
846720	850120	Those that responded to the salt regimen with a relatively high blood pressure and those
850120	852840	that responded with a relatively low blood pressure.
852840	857840	And holy smokes, Doll jumped up, slapped his desk, yelled Eureka and brought around for
857840	860840	all of his colleagues because he knew he was on to something.
860840	866560	I mean, there's no evidence he actually did that, but good imagine.
866560	870960	His rats that responded with high blood pressure from excess salt were coin salt sensitive.
870960	874720	His rats that responded with low blood pressures were coin salt resistant.
874720	877240	The results were published and it made absolute waves.
877240	881160	I mean, as much as a scientific white paper could make, am I right?
881160	888040	But the paper was so big and so impactful because it established the idea of salt sensitivity.
888040	892040	Let's break down salt sensitivity, but first you're probably wondering if Doll's 1962
892040	893960	study was better than his 1961 study.
893960	897240	Let it be known that there has never been a single research paper published that did
897240	898240	not undergo criticism.
898240	902920	I mean, the world of academia is absolutely cutthroat, but for some reason when it comes
902920	907360	to salt, it's cutthroat, ear, arm and leg.
907360	910360	But 1962, that study published by Doll was actually pretty good.
910360	917720	I mean, there was one sly researcher who pointed out an absolutely massive issue with the study.
917720	923360	We're going to talk about this in a bit, but the structure and the way the study was performed
923360	925120	was undeniably good.
925120	929320	Salt sensitivity, the idea that we can inherit our blood pressure response to salt, as Doll
929320	932640	put it, is about a genetically transmitted sensitivity to salt.
932640	936760	What he observed was that the strain most prone to develop hypertension from salt did
936760	940440	not develop hypertension when excess dietary salt was emitted.
940440	942520	If you're anything like me, you're probably a little confused.
942520	943520	Think of it this way.
943520	949600	If my parents were Serena Williams and LeBron James, actually they're both happily married
949600	950600	with kids.
950600	956720	If I had two stellar athlete parents, I would have a predisposition to excel at sports.
956720	963000	But if I was never exposed to a single basketball tennis racket or hockey stick, I would never
963000	966920	have the chance to develop those athlete stellar skills.
966920	970880	In the same way, the offspring of the high blood pressure rats never developed high
970880	974840	blood pressure because they were never exposed to excess salt.
974840	980520	Okay, now how well does Doll study and the concept of salt sensitivity translate to the
980520	981520	real world?
981520	987840	Doll was working with lab rats in a controlled environment where mating was precisely calculated.
987840	993600	Humans don't live in that kind of world, so of course this isn't an exact translation.
993600	999360	In fact, far from it because humans are really just that genetically complex.
999360	1004680	Now a quick search up on Dr. Google and you'll come across some entities settling on salt
1004680	1010160	sensitivity as the resolution of salt's relationship with blood pressure.
1010160	1014200	For example, the National Heart, Long and Blood Institute make mention of salt sensitivity
1014200	1016320	in their Causes and Risk Factors article.
1016320	1022040	Okay, now the concept of salt sensitivity is okay, it makes sense, but one of its biggest
1022040	1025040	thoughts is that it is impossible to measure.
1025040	1032840	There is no consensus on the defining lines that make an individual salt sensitive.
1032840	1036920	These researchers put it best, both the amount of salt administered and the magnitude of
1036920	1042560	the response above which pressure is considered to be salt sensitive vary enormously among
1042560	1043560	studies.
1043560	1046520	So basically scientists have been experimenting with the idea of salt sensitivity, but they're
1046520	1051480	all using different amounts of salt and different salt sensitive thresholds.
1051480	1055240	Like when is a person salt sensitive after they take in this much salt and their blood
1055240	1059840	pressure rises this much or after they take in this much salt and their blood pressure
1059840	1061000	rises this much?
1061000	1066040	We can imagine this just opens up the world of conflicting data as each study is able
1066040	1068360	to move the goalpost to how they see fit.
1068360	1074240	Okay, now let's get to the Sly researcher who pointed out the massive issue with Dahl's
1074240	1076200	1962 lab rat study.
1076200	1078560	His name was F. O. Simpson.
1078560	1082280	I'm not excited to say how many research papers I looked through to find this man's
1082280	1085600	first name, but I do know his middle name is Olaf.
1085600	1091080	He's often cited for pointing out that the amount of salt that Dahl gave those rats was
1091080	1093600	simply enormous.
1093600	1096640	According to Simpson's calculations, if you translate the amount of salt consumed by
1096640	1102880	the rats and you make it relative to a 150-ish pound man, that man would be ingesting 560
1102880	1104760	grams of salt a day.
1104760	1108800	That's like knocking back 75% of an umbrella girl's salt container a day.
1108800	1111720	That's over 215,000 milligrams of sodium.
1111720	1115840	Now I did some more rodent research to find out if his calculations were accurate and
1115840	1120640	from what I can judge, his formula was a little inflated, so I cut it in half.
1120680	1124360	And obviously we're still talking about a ridiculous amount of salt at 280 grams of
1124360	1126720	salt or 107,000 milligrams of sodium.
1126720	1131860	So Dahl's 1962 lab rat study, on the one hand, it says a lot about the power of genetics.
1131860	1136440	On the other hand, in order to achieve hypertension in those rats, he gave them just flat-out
1136440	1140600	boo-cool loads of salt, unrealistic to the amount any human would ever consume.
1140600	1147480	So the study has a twang of deep value and a few sprinkles of irrelevance.
1147480	1148480	What do you make of it?
1148480	1153040	It doesn't matter because Dahl and his rats quickly became the salt reduction champions
1153040	1154400	of the United States.
1154400	1157840	If you're talking salt and hypertension, you're talking Lewis, Kitchener, Dahl.
1157840	1160880	He quickly became the front-running scientist for limiting salt.
1160880	1165120	His influence started to reach beyond just the scientific community, now the government
1165120	1166120	is getting involved.
1168120	1175440	1969, the White House had its first meeting to talk about reducing salt for the nation.
1175440	1180200	And in 1972, the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute sponsored the National Blood
1180200	1182960	Pressure Education campaign, the first campaign.
1182960	1186480	America is starting to get the message, and this campaign did not come out of nowhere.
1186480	1191200	Just earlier, in the same year, Dahl released one of his most controversial papers yet,
1191200	1192200	salt and hypertension.
1192200	1197080	It was a mix of a commentary and a review, and in it, he revealed that this was about
1197080	1199160	more than just the scientific facts.
1199160	1200160	Dahl wrote,
1200880	1212320	My social life is plagued by people who think I am against their eating salt.
1212320	1217560	I am convinced that adding salt is bad, but I do not believe that it is a sin.
1217560	1221400	I noticed something when reading Dahl's papers.
1221400	1229000	He had a repulsion for adding salt, the literal action of adding salt to a meal.
1229000	1230880	It clearly bothered him.
1230880	1234600	In his earlier work, he came up with the idea to classify people in groups depending on
1234600	1237040	if they added salt to their meal or not.
1237040	1241320	Those who added salt without tasting food were classified as high intake.
1241320	1245680	Now this is a hilariously fallible way to classify people, and Dahl would acknowledge
1245680	1250400	that, but what this does is it unmasks the theory that Dahl is driven by.
1250400	1254720	The salt that is present naturally in a food is all that is necessary.
1254720	1258000	Any salt added after that is bad.
1258000	1261960	That's right, completely unsalted meals for the king of salt reduction in America.
1261960	1266000	He will stand at 10 toes down, you couldn't shove him off his position if you were coming
1266000	1268800	in at 6'5 and 280 pounds.
1268800	1269800	As he wrote,
1277320	1278320	What?
1278320	1283520	In other words, Dahl was saying that he believed his conclusion to be true regardless of any
1283520	1286080	evidence you brought to his table to say otherwise.
1286080	1292240	And uh oh, Dahl's immovable position seemed to have rubbed off on the government.
1292240	1296800	You see, we may think that we have lower sodium options at the grocery store because the public
1296800	1303200	spoke out and demanded better lower salt options or else, but no, that didn't happen.
1303200	1308800	Low salt labels aren't a result of the public's cry out, but a direct result of the government's
1308800	1310400	numerous initiatives.
1310400	1314400	You see, it wasn't just the WHO or just the NHLBI.
1314400	1317760	After that 1969 meeting, everyone got involved.
1317760	1323820	The USDA, FDA, ADA, AHA, AMA, NBA, I mean the list goes on.
1323820	1327080	Agencies comprised of scientists, doctors, health professionals, agencies I'd never
1327080	1328920	heard of, the media got involved.
1328920	1333540	This was a nationwide effort from every relevant corner of the entire government.
1333540	1340200	The government tasked food industries to emphasize low sodium labeling and to make more low sodium
1340200	1341200	options.
1341200	1345320	Low salt labeling started to appear in grocery stores all across America.
1345320	1350640	This is one of the most grand dietary movements to ever take place in the United States.
1350640	1355800	Okay, so back to thinking about our thoughts.
1355800	1358440	We didn't get this from staying hip to the latest research.
1358440	1363360	Most of us had no idea what was going on in the 70s, but all of us have been in the grocery
1363360	1364360	store.
1364360	1368320	When you see a food and you see the low salt alternative, you cannot avoid the thought
1368320	1371600	that this ingredient cannot be good for me.
1371600	1376300	Now, multiply this by the media influence on the topic, multiply this by what your friends
1376300	1381000	and family say about salt, and we may not have paid attention to it, but most of us
1381000	1383880	have subliminally villainized salt.
1383880	1385560	You see, we have the order all wrong.
1385560	1391240	The research started it all, which then influenced the government, which then charged food industries,
1391240	1393880	which then influenced us.
1393880	1397560	The problem here is the same problem that we've been having for decades.
1397560	1399560	Where is the influence coming from?
1399560	1400560	There's two options.
1400560	1403520	In TOPS, who I mentioned earlier, I think he hit the nail on the head.
1403520	1406520	Public health policy versus good science.
1406520	1409080	Two behemoths, Godzilla versus King Kong.
1409080	1413400	TOPS also quoted Drum and Rini, an esteemed nephrologist who says, you can say without
1413400	1418680	a shadow of a doubt that NHLBI has made a commitment to salt education that goes way
1418680	1420640	beyond the scientific facts.
1420640	1422920	So Godzilla might be cheating a little bit.
1422920	1429240	The government going beyond the scope of facts to make policy sounds shady, right?
1429240	1434840	Any time there's a gap between the government doing something and why the government is
1434840	1438280	doing something, it's very tempting to want to bridge it.
1438280	1442080	Any attempt to bridge this gap is going to come off as conspiratorial.
1442080	1446280	If anything like me, you kind of check out when things become all about conspiracy.
1446280	1450920	They may serve a function somewhere, but in general, they kind of leave you cynical versus
1450920	1451920	empowered.
1451920	1453960	All masters will only have two things left to do.
1453960	1455920	We got to get down to dirty with the biology.
1455920	1459480	What's actually taking place in the body between sodium and blood pressure?
1459480	1463920	Then we got to look at the science, the big picture, and come up with a salty verdict.
1463920	1465920	Hey, fun fact.
1465920	1470280	Did you know I make these videos all on my own, completely independent?
1470280	1473360	And I'm not saying that for any reason other than the fact that I've read that some of
1473360	1475480	you guys think that I have a team.
1475480	1476480	I don't.
1476480	1478000	It's just me.
1478000	1483280	But I do have my supporters, you guys, and we still haven't come up with a community
1483280	1487160	name, but I think we're onto something with this hat.
1487160	1488160	It's yours.
1488160	1489160	It's available to you.
1489160	1490240	Check it out in the below.
1490240	1491240	In the below.
1491240	1492600	I almost had it one take.
1492600	1495080	Check it out in the link in the description.
1495080	1499520	Sodium and hypertension, a large part driving the confusion behind the topic, is the question
1499520	1500520	of how.
1500520	1502640	If sodium is affecting blood pressure, then how?
1502640	1504440	What mechanisms are at play here?
1504440	1508560	As this review states, pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to increased blood pressure values
1508560	1512400	have been long time debated and have not yet been completely elucidated.
1512400	1516800	In other words, the connection between sodium and blood pressure is an intricate one, and
1516800	1522200	no one has been able to say with 100% certainty that they know exactly what's going on here.
1522200	1525360	There are really three theories we're going to go over here, and it may be time to sit
1525360	1529720	up and lean in because this first one is packed with stuff we got to talk about.
1529720	1533680	Most folks, including a lot of scientists, believe in this first theory, and that is
1533680	1535840	the water retention theory.
1535840	1537280	We know sodium as an electrolyte.
1537280	1541160	We know a trait of electrolytes is that where they go, water follows.
1541160	1546160	With this, we can assume that an increase of sodium leads to a retention of sodium,
1546160	1548640	which leads to a retention of water.
1548640	1552960	The kidney is only letting out so much free water as it wants to keep some, so we aren't
1552960	1554520	too soft concentrated.
1554520	1558800	We end up reaching this steady water retained state.
1558800	1563880	More water means increased blood value, and increased blood value means increased blood
1563880	1564880	pressure.
1564880	1569000	Okay, can anybody guess where this theory can go wrong?
1569000	1571880	The answer isn't right in our face, and actually we have to zoom in a little bit.
1571880	1576720	A group of researchers were in a lab studying six healthy nonhypertensive men and gave them
1576720	1581480	increasingly more salt over the course of 24 days with the intentions of measuring something
1581480	1583920	totally unrelated to the subject at hand.
1583920	1588080	But their procedure led them to accidentally discover something that they weren't expecting.
1588080	1593040	They found that an increase of sodium did not lead to an increase of the body's water,
1593040	1595160	but a shift in the body's water.
1595160	1600120	The finding was so exciting that they did another study to focus on just that finding.
1600120	1602040	They performed a randomized control trial.
1602040	1604360	We got ourselves a gold batch.
1604360	1609800	They took 32 healthy nonhypertensive men and split them into four groups to be fed different
1609800	1611960	amounts of salt over seven days.
1611960	1617640	One group at 1,500 milligrams of salt, one at 6,000, one at 12,100, and finally, one
1617640	1619600	at 16,700.
1619600	1621960	Enough salt to make Louis Ketchum the doll sit up in his grave.
1621960	1623600	What they found was remarkable.
1623600	1629160	There was no water retention effect.
1629160	1631200	No water retention effect.
1631200	1635200	You hear that voice switch up, mess around, drop a podcast on y'all, change the game up.
1635200	1639160	Listen, if you really want to understand the weight of these researchers' results, and
1639160	1643600	not only that, but the actual relationship between salt and blood pressure, we do have
1643600	1645400	to go a little deeper.
1645400	1650000	And if you're anything like me, once you start to go a little deep, you kind of lose it.
1650000	1654640	So I heard that if you hit the like button, that increases your chances of understanding
1654640	1657880	by like 15%.
1657880	1660040	Don't be the person to not find out.
1660040	1663040	Intracellular water is the water that resides inside of ourselves.
1663040	1667960	There's a lot of places for the body to put water other than inside of ourselves, so extracellular
1667960	1673400	water, water outside of ourselves, has to be compartmentalized to smaller subcompartments.
1673400	1676440	One is intravascular water, the water within our blood vessels.
1676440	1679720	The other is interstitial water, the water running in between everything.
1679720	1684200	What these researchers found was that the intravascular fluid volume was the fluid compartment that
1684200	1689400	increased after salt loading, and somehow, extracellular fluid volume was unaffected.
1689400	1693440	Now, when I say I was befuddled reading this, I was absolutely befuddled.
1693440	1698840	How can something that is within something increase in volume, but the whole entire thing
1698840	1699840	doesn't increase in volume?
1699840	1703440	If we picture this out, it's like having one big balloon, and inside of it are two
1703440	1704680	smaller balloons.
1704680	1708680	One of them increases in volume, but the big balloon's volume doesn't change.
1708680	1709680	How can this happen?
1709680	1714420	Well, the researchers found there was a shift of the interstitial fluid into the intravascular
1714420	1717760	fluid, like one little balloon giving air to the other.
1717760	1721840	The researchers also found this experiment to have no effect on the participant's blood
1721840	1723320	pressure throughout the study.
1723320	1724800	How?
1724800	1729760	Intravascular fluid increased, which means blood volume increased, which means blood pressure
1729760	1731640	should increase, right?
1731640	1736560	The researchers mentioned after a high salt mill, the blood volume is going to increase.
1736560	1740600	It seems for healthy individuals, this effect is temporary, or what we call transient.
1740600	1744480	As the researchers noted, this increased blood volume lasted for only an hour or two.
1744480	1746200	This is me saying this, not them.
1746200	1750760	I believe they didn't find an effect on blood pressure because it's not like the
1750760	1754480	blood pressure never budged during the study, but they said that they measured it in the
1754480	1761760	morning, not directly after salt loading, which would mean that the participant's underlying
1761760	1764920	blood pressure throughout the entire study was unaffected.
1764920	1770920	I told you to lean in and buckle up.
1770920	1776960	Now how can the body hold more sodium, yet not retain a corresponding amount of water?
1776960	1782040	This was hinted at a non-osmolar storage of sodium, meaning sodium in the body that is
1782040	1783880	not impacting water balance.
1783880	1785840	This is absolutely buck wild.
1785840	1787960	This ninja sodium in the body.
1787960	1792120	If we dove deeper into this, we'd be steering way off of the course of this video, but we're
1792120	1797000	starting to enter the territory of understanding just how complex this relationship between
1797000	1799640	sodium and blood pressure actually is.
1799640	1801800	This isn't the only research paper that shakes things up.
1801800	1806280	We're learning and discovering that sodium handling, how the body handles sodium, it's
1806600	1808440	much more dynamic than what we thought.
1808440	1814120	Theory number two is a popular theory introduced by scientists named Guyton in 1991, explained
1814120	1819320	that the kidney and its related system is really the judge of if we undergo high blood pressure
1819320	1821280	from excess salt or not.
1821280	1825000	The kidney is closely intertwined with hormones, enzymes, and other little things that tightly
1825000	1829120	regulate fluid balance, the tightening and widening of blood vessels, as well as blood
1829120	1830280	pressure overall.
1830280	1833920	To keep things simple, we'll refer to this as the kidney fluid system.
1833920	1838040	The kidney fluid system is one of the systems in charge of keeping the body in homeostasis,
1838040	1841200	a.k.a. a state of physiological balance.
1841200	1843080	The Guyton theory goes as follows.
1843080	1847240	Increased salt results in increased thirst, increased thirst results in increased water
1847240	1848640	drinking to balance it out.
1848640	1853440	This increase in body fluid leads to increased volume of the blood, which then increases
1853440	1854640	blood pressure.
1854640	1859760	He says as long as the kidney fluid system functions normally, we can eat either extremely
1859760	1865360	small amounts of salt or as much as 50 times as much without a major alteration in blood
1865360	1866480	pressure.
1866480	1871160	By this theory, regarding blood pressure, a person's salt sensitivity could be determined
1871160	1876360	by how much of a bottleneck or a handicap a person's kidney fluid system is.
1876360	1880600	In a sense that if a person's kidney cannot pee out enough sodium to keep things balanced
1880600	1887040	without sufficiently raising the blood pressure, then that person is more salt sensitive.
1887320	1891080	Now, the Guyton theory is one of the most recognized theories there is, but it is not
1891080	1893120	the walk-off home run answer.
1893120	1894920	There's still a lot of nuance going on here.
1894920	1897320	Theory number three isn't really much of a theory.
1897320	1901080	It's just an excuse for me to bring up the sympathetic nervous system because our nervous
1901080	1904960	system is all up in the mix of this relationship with sodium and blood pressure.
1904960	1909000	The sympathetic nervous system is in charge of our fight or flight mode, the mode that
1909000	1912240	activates when we're stressed, in danger, or highly active.
1912240	1915440	This mode is always on just in varying degrees.
1915440	1919280	Its activity is hiding when you're getting ready to skydive out of a plane, and its activity
1919280	1922680	is lessened when you're winding down with some bedside reading.
1922680	1927880	The sympathetic nervous system is the major system behind our blood pressure responses.
1927880	1932520	This study on lab rats found that after a high salt regimen, it wasn't the salt itself
1932520	1937120	that increased blood pressure, but an over-activation of the sympathetic nervous system that made
1937120	1939920	the rats more sensitive to the salt.
1939920	1943400	Another rat study, I mean take it how you want, but I could not possibly create this
1943400	1948040	video without mentioning the sympathetic nervous system, which quick tip we can directly
1948040	1950560	influence by breathing.
1950560	1955440	I always say there's a reason we are designed to control what is otherwise automatic in
1955440	1956440	breathing.
1956440	1959920	Again, not going too deep here, but I want us to get into the headspace of what all is
1959920	1960920	going into this.
1960920	1964040	There's a reason you never heard of how salt and blood pressure are connected because
1964040	1968760	how can we even explain it in just a few sentences, but there is something going on.
1968760	1971960	It just isn't as linear as 1, 2, 3, ABC.
1971960	1977680	It's more like 1, 2 percent sign X of left, down, down, right.
1977680	1985280	Now we have to ask the question, if the connection between salt and blood pressure is so not
1985280	1990320	straightforward, then why are our instructions so straightforward?
1990320	1992080	Reduce your salt intake.
1992080	1997320	With one of the most cited recommendations being the WHO, less than 2,000 milligrams
1997320	1999880	of sodium, that's 5 grams of salt.
1999880	2003280	That's about this much.
2003280	2005200	Not a salty pebble more.
2005200	2006200	That's it.
2006200	2010000	I may have an unpopular opinion here, but I don't think there's anything inherently
2010000	2016200	wrong with the prescription of less than 2,000 milligrams, however I do believe it's enormously
2016200	2023960	irresponsible for myself, the government, or anyone to dub 2,000 as the magic number.
2023960	2028840	The idea that we could fit every single body on the same less than 2,000 milligrams boat
2028880	2034280	and happily ship that salty sucker off smooth sailing down the river is ridiculous.
2034280	2038560	All right, I gotta clean up all the salt that I spilled on the floor.
2038560	2042600	The salt saga is just like running the 400 meter hurdle race.
2042600	2045240	There is barrier after barrier after barrier.
2045240	2050360	If we want to get the answers that we want, then we gotta traverse over these hurdles.
2050360	2051360	What are these hurdles?
2051360	2055640	Well, it's the research, it's kind of bad, and it's getting in the way.
2055640	2057960	Let's zoom out and understand the scope of the issue.
2058680	2059680	Blood pressure.
2059680	2060680	The goal?
2060680	2063520	Figure out if and how they're connected.
2063520	2064720	How can we go about this?
2064720	2066880	We have two options, really.
2066880	2068840	Observational studies and interventional studies.
2068840	2071160	In observational studies, we're looking at a population.
2071160	2075200	We assess their salt intake, we assess their blood pressure, and boom, we have our results.
2075200	2078040	There are different ways to go about this, and each method yielding different levels
2078040	2079760	of quality in the results.
2079760	2082080	We can do a 24-hour recall.
2082080	2089360	Hey, population of people, us scientists, are time to figure out how much sodium you
2089360	2090360	consume.
2090360	2096360	Please tell us what you've eaten over the last 24 hours.
2096360	2100040	Most of us hardly remember what we had just a few hours ago for breakfast.
2100040	2105560	Not to mention, this method only captures one day, and unless the entire population
2105560	2111920	of people is the type to sling together the same ham sandwich every single day for lunch,
2111920	2113720	then one day just won't cut it.
2113720	2116000	24-hour recall, try it.
2116000	2124280	We could do food records.
2124280	2128200	This is prone to bias, and it's hard to get a large group of people to adhere to this
2128200	2131240	method, especially if you don't have them gathered up in the laboratory.
2131240	2135520	Food records, better than 24-hour recall, but still garbage.
2135520	2148360	What about a food frequency questionnaire?
2148360	2152160	This method has similar issues as the past two, plus it's not specific enough.
2152160	2159360	So food frequency questionnaire, the best method to measure sodium in an observational study
2159360	2162800	would have to be collecting pee.
2162800	2170000	Not from just one urine sample, not from just a few urine samples over eight hours,
2170000	2177360	but it's going to have to be the gold standard of collecting multiple consecutive 24-hour
2177360	2178960	pee tests.
2178960	2183360	That's the only way to get an accurate snapshot of a person's sodium intake.
2183360	2188120	Okay, I'm being a little facetious when I call the research straight up bad, but I want
2188120	2192720	us to understand the challenge that we've been facing and continue to face.
2192720	2199320	Sodium varies way too much day to day to do anything other than multiple 24-hour pee
2199320	2200320	tests.
2200320	2204880	However, these tests are very difficult to orchestrate.
2204880	2208680	Imagine being in one of these studies and you were tasked to have every single urine
2208680	2211280	episode collected for two to three days.
2211280	2214680	When it comes to observational studies, the harder something is for scientists and the
2214680	2218360	population to carry out, the less people the study will have.
2218360	2220360	The easier it is for everyone, the more people.
2220360	2224760	So we're choosing between what we want, a high volume of folks at the expense of accuracy
2224760	2228400	or high accuracy at the expense of the amount of folks.
2228400	2232720	The American Heart Association put out an article just about how many chances there
2232720	2236080	are for a large observational study to go wrong.
2236080	2240040	What if there are participants who were instructed by their doctor to reduce sodium or they're
2240040	2241360	on blood pressure meds?
2241360	2244360	What if some folks are sick or have pre-existing conditions?
2244360	2247280	What about confounding factors like age, sex, race, or smoking?
2247280	2251560	The imbalance, too many people, too far apart in age or race, what if the researchers suck
2251560	2252560	at following up?
2252560	2255760	I mean, the list goes on and on, but now that we have a solid understanding of the plight
2255760	2258400	of observational studies, let's overview interventional.
2258400	2262920	And short interventional studies are just when the researchers do something, they intervene
2262920	2264160	with the subjects.
2264160	2265520	They typically look like this.
2265520	2269760	We split subjects up into two or more groups, we give subjects different levels of salt,
2269760	2272480	and we measure their blood pressure responses.
2272480	2277040	Interventional studies have a spectrum of quality as well, but are miles ahead of observational
2277040	2282120	studies in terms of the value that we get because of the level of control that the researchers
2282120	2283120	get.
2283120	2286520	We can be extremely picky over the exact avatar of a person we want to measure.
2286520	2288560	We can keep folks in a lab for a few days.
2288560	2290200	We can feed exact amounts of sodium.
2290200	2293320	We can randomize participants, blind them to what we're measuring.
2293320	2295900	We can have a control group to balance out results.
2295900	2297400	We have control.
2297400	2302880	Now, interventional studies aren't completely free of biases and other error, but they are
2302880	2308540	the reason that in general, the scientific community does agree that reducing sodium
2308540	2310560	can reduce blood pressure.
2310560	2313440	And that leads us perfectly into this next one.
2313440	2320400	After 120 years of measuring salt and blood pressure, what do we agree on?
2320400	2321400	Three things.
2321400	2325320	Number one, the scientific community generally agrees this is hard.
2325320	2329080	It's really hard to get the number of how much sodium.
2329080	2333480	The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, or NASM, is a non-governmental
2333480	2334840	independent organization.
2334840	2338600	The nutritional arm of this organization are the folks who come up with dietary reference
2338600	2339600	intakes.
2339600	2342560	Information the public receives on how much of stuff we should be consuming.
2342560	2346760	For example, this amount of vitamin A will cover the ground for a majority of healthy
2346760	2347760	folks.
2347760	2350320	This amount of vitamin A is probably pushing it.
2350320	2354320	When they can't come up with these exact numbers, they pull out what they call the adequate
2354320	2359040	intake number, which is used to basically say, hey, you need at least this much.
2359040	2361560	There ain't enough evidence to come up with anything else.
2361560	2362560	And you guessed it.
2362560	2366400	I looked at the sodium report and I haven't seen the words insufficient evidence repeated
2366400	2368120	more than anything I've ever read.
2368120	2370080	So they have to come up with this adequate intake number.
2370080	2373000	And in order to do this, they have to look at sodium balance.
2373000	2374000	Sodium balance.
2374000	2377920	If we can measure every molecule of sodium entering and leaving someone, we may be able
2377920	2381600	to get a good idea of how much is physiologically needed.
2381600	2385880	This is so incredibly hard to do that NASM mentioned only two studies were able to pull
2385880	2388960	it off and they said only one was rigorous enough.
2388960	2394040	In the end, NASM came up with the adequate intake number of 1500 milligrams.
2394040	2398800	But the number doesn't matter as much as why they state these numbers are so hard to come
2398800	2399800	up with.
2399800	2402200	Secretration and infradient rhythm.
2402200	2404040	What language am I speaking?
2404040	2410720	NASM pointed out these two things as another factor, not only widening the difference between
2410720	2416800	an individual and a separate individual, but the difference between an individual and himself.
2416800	2421480	Secretion refers to sodium storage in the body that isn't subject to excretion.
2421480	2425920	So in the same way that we stash our piggy banks in the top left corner of our closets,
2425920	2429440	there's emerging evidence that our body does this as well with sodium.
2429440	2433880	Infradient rhythm refers to how sodium handling in the body isn't subject to circadian rhythm.
2433880	2435640	Like our hormones are, for example.
2435640	2440000	What the body does with sodium within 24 hours may be miles away from what it will do in
2440000	2441000	the next.
2441000	2444280	Agreement number two, we're going to pull out a review published in 2020 that highlighted
2444280	2446680	areas of agreement for my own personal convenience.
2446680	2451240	There's general agreement that reducing sodium intake reduces blood pressure, especially
2451240	2455800	in people with hypertension, especially in people with hypertension.
2455800	2459440	An important note, I wanted to highlight something that was said in another review.
2459440	2463680	More studies have confirmed the benefit of reducing sodium intake in hypertensive subjects
2463680	2464680	with a high salt intake.
2464680	2470800	It is unclear whether the remaining more than 90% of the population will profit from a dietary
2470800	2472160	sodium restriction.
2472160	2477360	It would perhaps be more correct to start discussing inappropriate rather than excessive
2477360	2478360	salt intake.
2478360	2483040	Thirdly, the scientific community also generally agrees that high sodium intake is deleterious.
2483040	2487520	The review went on to say, mortality from cardiovascular disease increased at the highest
2487520	2491720	levels of sodium consumption, noting over 5,000 milligrams.
2491720	2493200	Mortality referring to the rate of death.
2493200	2497160	We want mortality to be low, and now is actually the perfect time to hop right into it.
2497160	2498720	Let's not wait a moment further.
2498720	2501040	We're going to discuss the big picture.
2501040	2504600	We're talking about salt and blood pressure.
2504600	2510600	We are using blood pressure as the risk factor, meaning an increased blood pressure equals
2510600	2512640	an increased risk.
2512640	2514640	Increased risk of what?
2514640	2515640	Cardiovascular disease.
2515640	2522560	This lives under the assumption that an increased blood pressure can eventually lead to cardiovascular
2522560	2523560	disease.
2523560	2525720	So high blood pressure isn't the problem.
2525720	2531320	Now saying it isn't a problem, but it is one of the handful of things that is indicative
2531320	2535760	of an individual who may suffer from a cardiovascular disease.
2535760	2538240	Can high sodium increase blood pressure?
2538240	2540280	Yes, we've learned that.
2540280	2544840	Does high sodium increase blood pressure in every person every time?
2544840	2546120	No, it does not.
2546120	2547240	We've learned that.
2547240	2549720	Sodium has a relationship with blood pressure.
2549720	2553560	Its relationship is not linear for everyone across the board.
2553560	2557360	Sodium is also not the only factor modulating blood pressure.
2557360	2564080	So sodium cannot be the sole reason we would develop cardiovascular disease.
2564080	2565080	Why do I bring this up?
2565080	2567000	Because we've made it all about salt.
2567000	2571680	But when we bring up the increased mortality rate of individuals consuming these levels
2571680	2577320	of salt, we have to ask, where are they getting this salt from?
2577320	2583200	450 adults, Alabama, California, and Minnesota, equal numbers of men and women from each
2583240	2587480	ethnic group of blacks, Asians, Hispanics, and whites were assessed.
2587480	2596040	They found that over 70% of the sodium consumed was from processed foods.
2596040	2600400	I've read how high salt is linked to other diseases other than cardiovascular diseases,
2600400	2601400	right?
2601400	2603640	Like stomach cancer or kidney disease.
2603640	2607480	But I mean, come on, I'd be shocked if it wasn't connected to these things considering
2607480	2611480	that high salt is coming straight from the stuff that's been taking us out the whole
2611480	2612480	time.
2612480	2614080	So, what's the total of this ingredient list?
2614080	2615280	Can you guess the food?
2615280	2619080	So ingredient lists are ordered from what's present in the food in the highest amount
2619080	2620720	to the lowest.
2620720	2622880	Sugar is the first ingredient.
2622880	2628840	Okay, so this was a bag of popcorn, but somehow popcorn ended up being the second ingredient?
2628840	2630320	How do you even pull that off?
2630320	2634800	How can knocking back stuff like this with loads of sugar, problematic oils, and miscellaneous
2634800	2639160	synthetic stuff not be linked to various diseases?
2639160	2642320	Okay, but what do we focus on sodium alone?
2642320	2647520	Well, two handfuls of this stuff will net us somewhere around 160 milligrams of sodium.
2647520	2650120	But this bag of popcorn is a pretty bad offender.
2650120	2651120	What about this?
2651120	2653360	A slice of sandwich bread.
2653360	2656400	We're looking at about 130 milligrams of sodium.
2656400	2661760	Perhaps with this we have a sausage, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich for breakfast.
2661760	2665520	For lunch, we're having canned veggie soup with a turkey sami.
2665520	2669440	The fam had spaghetti for dinner, but we weren't that hungry, so we only had a teeny bit along
2669440	2672560	with a side salad with that hidden valley ranch.
2672560	2678280	At the end of the day, we end up somewhere around 2,695 milligrams of sodium.
2678280	2682880	This isn't an outrageous number by any means, but that's actually not the point.
2682880	2683880	Look at it this way.
2683880	2690480	Popular strawberry flavored breakfast bar, strawberry, potato chips, potato, canned tomato
2690480	2692440	sauce, tomato.
2692440	2696840	Naturally, whole foods ain't coming along with a lot of salty baggage.
2696840	2700840	From the farm to your plate, who has more input on your food?
2700840	2702440	You or the food industry?
2702440	2708040	The more responsibility over our food we relinquish up to the food industry, the more
2708040	2710360	salt our food will end up having.
2710360	2715080	Some of the saltiest of the bunch being cured meats, canned items, and bread adds up as well.
2715080	2717360	The food industry needs to add salt for a ton of reasons.
2717360	2720960	Preservation, flavor helps with coloration, and even texture for some foods.
2720960	2722880	Okay, don't get me wrong here y'all.
2722880	2726800	It's not as if salt is the reason processed food is bad.
2726800	2729640	Processed food has a lot to be desired.
2729640	2733720	The problem is the same problem America has been facing from the jump.
2733720	2735560	Too much.
2735560	2739800	Most people ingest more salt than needed, but in the western world, this could be generalized
2739800	2743640	to all minerals, vitamins, energy sources, and even water.
2743640	2745240	Too many vitamins and minerals.
2745240	2746240	What about this?
2746240	2750040	Imagine the individual going through life on willy-nilly with their nutrition, ordering
2750040	2754080	and eating out, take out, grab and go, handful it is, handful it at, leaving their food
2754080	2755680	up to the will of the industry.
2755720	2759920	Versus the nutritionally proactive individual who starts with whole foods, adding their
2759920	2761720	own salt and going from there.
2761720	2765320	The sodium intake difference between these two people would be massive.
2765320	2770040	But even so, if we analyze the individual who is consuming these processed foods, this
2770040	2774560	is the same individual who is less likely to have an exercise routine, is less likely
2774560	2779880	to have a sleep routine, is less likely to have a de-stress routine, this person is less
2779880	2781840	likely to be health conscious.
2781840	2786440	You tell me, who is more likely to develop hypertension and cardiovascular disease?
2786440	2790760	Salt isn't the problem as far as lifestyle is the problem.
2794760	2795760	Wow.
2795760	2797760	I mean, there's so much we couldn't even get to.
2797760	2801920	Potassium, which is abundant in plant food, is kind of like the biological opposite of
2801920	2802920	sodium.
2802920	2805800	I didn't even mention some of the awesome functions of sodium, how it's a major player
2805800	2807120	in our nervous system.
2807120	2809760	I kind of think of sodium as the mineral of action.
2809760	2811440	Without it, we'd be as stiff as a street light.
2811440	2815720	I'm sure I'll see a comment about the inter-salt study of 88, one of the largest international
2815720	2817280	studies ever done.
2817280	2820600	Another seminal point to the salty saga, still questions to be answered.
2820600	2823760	What about the sodium needs of a person that simply moves more?
2823760	2827400	How do my sodium needs change as my life changes in season?
2827400	2831160	You should be asking yourself, how did I get to this point in the video and not leave a
2831160	2832160	like?
2832160	2833160	Love you guys.
2833160	2834160	Thanks so much.
