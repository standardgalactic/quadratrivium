0	9920	Monicarlo rendering can produce beautiful images like the ones shown here, but requires
9920	14640	calculating many expensive rays resulting in lengthy render times.
14640	19000	A few samples can be quickly evaluated, but the inaccuracy of this estimate appears as
19000	21000	noise in the final image.
21000	24960	One way to address this problem is to apply a denoising filter to generate a pleasing
24960	26640	noise-free image.
26640	30600	In this paper, we observe that there is a complex underlying relationship between the
30600	36440	input noisy data and the optimal filter parameters, and thus we propose to learn it.
36440	41240	In our system, the renderer outputs a set of primary features at each pixel, including
41240	45240	screen position, color, world position, and shading normal.
45240	50080	A local neighborhood of each pixel is processed to get a set of secondary features such as
50080	52960	feature statistics, among others.
52960	57440	These in turn are given to a multi-layer perceptron neural network to output a set of
57440	58800	filter parameters.
58800	64000	Finally, the filter takes these computed parameters and the noisy output of the rendering system
64000	66400	to generate a filtered pixel.
66400	70800	This process is done for all of the pixels to generate a filtered image with comparable
70800	73200	quality to the ground truth.
73200	78400	We train the network on a set of scenes containing a variety of Monicarlo effects such as depth
78400	83360	of field, area light sampling, motion blur, and global illumination.
83360	87200	The network is trained with the iterative backpropagation process.
87200	94560	Here is a video sequence showing how the network converges for a particular scene during training.
94560	98800	Here are some results generated by our system using a cross bilateral filter on a set of
98800	105200	test scenes not included in the training set.
105200	110120	Our approach can be extended to handle animated sequences by performing the filtering process
110120	112080	on spatiotemporal volumes.
