0	4760	If it's really the case that sex work is work, then what is the problem with being asked
4760	6480	by your boss to give him a blowjob?
6480	7480	It's work.
7480	8480	It's just a service.
8480	10560	It's like being asked to do it over time or make a coffee.
10560	14800	No one actually thinks that it's just like making a coffee.
14800	15800	Louise Perry.
15800	16800	Welcome on the show.
16800	18600	Thank you so much for having me.
18600	24280	Given your political background, how does it feel to have Ben Shapiro quote tweeting
24280	25280	your work?
25280	28240	I didn't know he had.
28240	29240	Did you not see this?
30120	31120	Let me tell you.
31120	38360	So there is a tweet that someone put out a couple of days ago explaining about how don't
38360	45040	kink shame the naked men doing parades in front of children and twerking in front of
45040	46720	cops.
46720	49240	And that was one photo, which was a news story.
49240	55640	And the other photo was the chapter list from your book, which said things like men
55640	59600	and women are different and loveless sex is not empowering.
59600	66880	And it said, people of the West choose your future, something like that.
66880	67880	Wow.
67880	68880	Okay.
68880	69880	Yeah.
69880	70880	Okay.
70880	71880	That explains things.
71880	78080	I have quite like a heavy notification filter on Twitter, so I don't always see everything.
78080	84480	The contents page though completely blew up like three months ago, long before the book
84480	85480	was published.
85480	90640	The publisher just put up online the cover, the title, the fact that Kathleen Stock wrote
90640	97200	the forward because she's got a kind of existing reputation among her haters, my haters, and
97200	98200	the contents page.
98200	101200	And that was enough to have like a several day Twitter storm.
101200	102200	Why do you think that was?
102200	103200	Those statements.
103200	108760	I mean, I guess because, I mean, I did write the chapters with the knowledge that they're
108760	117680	like, they're simultaneously obvious and also incredibly provocative, which was like
117680	121000	precisely my intention because some people read it.
121000	124920	I mean, some people read the whole book, but some people read the chapters in particular
124920	126960	and they're like, yeah.
126960	135240	And other people read them as like fascist, basically, I mean, like so politically outrageous.
135240	139000	I mean, I'd say that the response to the book so far has only been out for a couple
139000	145120	of weeks in the UK and not yet in the States is like 80% really positive and 20% complete
145120	149760	outrage and not very much in the middle.
149760	153240	I think, well, what do you think's going to happen when it comes out in America?
153240	156120	That's a good question.
156120	162360	I mean, the like the culture is more intense in America in every way.
162360	164040	It's so similar, I think, to what we have here.
164040	171560	I mean, actually, I think we import it really, but yeah, I don't know.
171560	179240	I mean, I did, like British political context is different from American, right?
179240	185120	And I write for the New Statesman magazine, for instance, which is like traditionally
185120	188280	left-wing outlet.
188280	191920	I have come from the left, even if I wouldn't necessarily consider myself still a part of
191920	192920	the left and so on.
192920	198440	So like, I hope the book doesn't just get treated as like yet another socially conservative
198440	205120	take on such revolution because even if I'm reaching some conservative conclusions, I'm
205120	209040	doing it via different priors, if that makes sense.
209040	210040	Yeah.
210040	214480	Well, didn't you say I start from feminist priors and end up with socially conservative
214480	215480	conclusions?
215480	221040	Yeah, some socially conservative conclusions, yeah, which means that there's sort of something
221160	223160	in it for everyone to hate.
223160	227160	Except Ben Shapiro, apparently.
227160	228560	He's not read the whole thing.
228560	231360	I'm not sure how he might think about some of the early chapters.
231360	236360	You've been co-opted by the right wing of America now, and this is your future.
236360	241680	So I was at the Heterodox Academy, Jonathan Heights organization, I was at the conference
241680	242680	for that this weekend.
242680	249240	One of the speakers said something that kind of, I think, sort of is a good synopsis of
249240	254040	the thesis of your book that says, there are many ways to change the world, few will make
254040	257000	it better, many will make it worse.
257000	261200	Yeah, it's true.
261200	262600	There's a real discretion quote like that.
262600	268560	I can't remember exactly how it's phrased, but something like, it's really easy to break
268560	275280	things and it's really hard to make things, which I think is, it's like a really fundamentally
275280	278160	conservative observation.
278160	279480	And true.
279480	282760	What's wrong with the sexual revolution then?
282760	288240	So my argument in the book is basically that there are some really important ways in which
288240	290640	men and women are different from one another.
290640	295360	So some of those differences are physical and should be fairly obvious.
295360	300640	Like only women can get pregnant, men are bigger and stronger than women are on average,
300640	305560	but also that the difference is massive between the, between the means.
305560	311320	And also there are psychological differences, which a lot of feminism of the last half century
311320	319600	or more has been really invested in minimizing, but I think definitely there, if you look
319600	324560	at the research, and it will see just look at the world around you.
324560	328560	One of those differences, for instance, is that male sexuality is different from female
328600	333000	sexuality on average, that men are more likely to be into things like casual sex, watching
333000	339120	porn, buying sex, all things that have become much more socially acceptable post sexual
339120	340600	revolution.
340600	346200	And my argument basically is that the sexual revolution was kicked off by the pill, and
346200	352480	the, which, which did a pretty good job of severing the link between sex and reproduction.
352480	356400	And it's kind of gave the impression that sex could just be a leisure activity that
356440	360840	didn't have to mean anything, it could just be sort of a bit of fun.
360840	364760	And my argument is actually that that idea that sex is just just a bit of fun, it doesn't
364760	370120	really mean anything, suit male interests much more than it does female, because casual
370120	377560	sex in particular is just one, one men wanting more than women do, and two women carry all
377560	383800	of the risks associated with it, like physical risks like pregnancy and violence and so on.
383840	386920	So my argument basically is it's a bad deal for them.
386920	391960	Originally, it was the sort of thing that was pushed by liberals and feminists, right?
391960	393520	This is exactly the sort of thing.
393520	398440	Yeah, yeah, I mean, the, yeah, so the, the popular narrative that I'm challenging is
398440	401080	one that the sexual revolution was like a feminist accomplishment.
402280	403480	And I don't think that's true.
403600	406360	I mean, which is not to say that there aren't some things about it that have been good for
406360	410680	women. I mean, I mean, if you look at the story of recent decades in particular, there
410680	414840	are all sorts of ways in which women are doing great actually, like women are women are going
414840	419560	to university more often than men are, they are right up until they have children are
419560	420760	doing better in the workplace.
420760	424800	You know, this is, it's not to say that like everything is like the battle of the sexes
424800	426840	women are like losing across the board, not at all.
428160	434280	But I think in terms of sexual culture, that I'm concerned, I'm concerned for women, I'm
434280	435240	also concerned for men.
435240	439320	I mean, there's a lot in the book about, for instance, the really malign influence of
439320	447400	porn on young men, like that in a superficial and short term way, it's great to be a really
447400	451800	attractive man in this sexual culture, right, you can basically attract as many partners
451800	456600	as you like, you know, consequence free sex is freely available to you.
457080	463400	But I think actually in the long run, that's not a very, that's not a happy way to live your life.
464360	468760	You say that your complaint is focused more against liberals than conservatives.
468760	469320	Why is that?
470520	475240	I mean, because I'm expecting liberals to read it, I might be wrong about that.
475240	480200	But I that that's the space that I'm coming from originally, I went to, I went to such
480200	481400	a left-wing university.
482040	482600	Where did you go?
483160	485160	I went to SOAS in London.
485160	486120	I don't even know what that is.
486680	489160	It's like a really, really small, really crazy university.
490200	495960	So I, you know, I've, I've read all of the, all of this radical stuff as a student and
496520	501800	I'm coming from a feminist background and coming from, as I said, the, you know,
501800	504920	the new statesman that I work for is, is, is historically left-wing.
506280	509800	So I'm kind of, I'm trying to speak to those people.
511640	515000	But I mean, the books for conservatives as well, because there are bits in it that I
515000	519960	think every, everyone will, will find, will find challenging.
519960	522760	Is it not the fact that a lot of what you're talking about here is
523720	530200	conserving some fairly traditional views around men's and women's roles with each other about
530200	533880	sort of chivalrous conduct and having constraints on the way that men and their
533880	536600	regression and their desire for multiple sexual partners.
536600	540280	Like that, that is a fundamentally conservative value.
540280	545320	So it seems to me like the conservatives would have far less to disagree with you.
545320	549400	Not again, there's something for everybody to disagree with, but that the conservatives
549400	553160	would probably have far less than the new wave of liberals.
555000	556040	Probably, yeah.
556040	560840	Although I should say that the, this idea of like constraining male sexuality,
560840	564520	which is, which is, is, is central to my pieces basically.
565720	567560	It is conservative in the sense that it was,
569640	574360	it was considered to be like a mainstream idea before sexual revolution in the West.
574360	578040	But if you look across time and place, like that's not necessarily considered like
578120	580520	a trad thing to do.
580520	582600	I mean, like, if you look, for instance, at antiquity,
583800	589560	the idea that some high status man would have access to sexual access to his underlings was
589560	592280	like completely accepted.
592280	595000	It's really, I don't know if you've read Tom Holland's book, Dominion.
595880	599480	No, you don't mean Tom Holland's the guy that plays Spiderman, do you?
599480	600040	No, I don't.
601160	602520	A common mistake.
602520	606760	No, no, he's a British academic and historian writer.
607400	609720	And he's got this fantastic book called Dominion, which is about
610840	615560	basically about history of Christianity and the ways in which Christianity influences
615560	618280	the modern world, even if we consider ourselves to be
619160	620520	a religious or post-Christian.
622520	625000	And he has a bit in there where he talks about me too.
626040	627960	And it really triggered a lot of my thinking about this actually,
627960	632840	a few years ago, where he points out that in, say, the Roman world,
632840	635400	no one would think that Harvey Weinstein was doing anything wrong.
636360	641720	Like the idea that this guy who's at the top of the tree of his particular hierarchy
641720	647320	would be able to have sexual access to anyone kind of subordinate to him was like, yeah,
647320	648280	obviously.
648280	657480	And actually, the idea that he should be constrained is, Holland argues, a very Christian idea.
658680	660520	And I'm not Christian.
660520	662520	I'm not coming at this from a religious perspective.
663240	665240	But it's worth pointing that out.
665240	667640	You know, like this is not necessarily a normal thing to think.
668760	672440	The window of trad sort of shifts over time, right?
672440	674600	Like no one's actually going that far back.
674600	677160	So, OK, so the sexual revolution happens.
677160	683480	Like, surely women have benefited with no more shame and stigma around enjoying sex
683480	684280	and stuff like that.
685160	687480	Who benefited from the sexual revolution overall?
689080	690520	Yeah, so the shame and stigma thing.
690520	693320	I mean, yes, that is definitely one outcome.
693320	698200	I mean, like, I think that one of the things that I'm trying to push in this book,
698200	703880	and that is shared with, like, Mary Harrington and Nina Powell that you've had on the show before.
705000	709640	Yeah, we're on the same page about this, like, challenging the idea of progress,
710360	716520	particularly from a feminist perspective, this idea that history has a shape
716520	718520	and everything is always getting better and better.
719080	723640	And everything post-sexual revolution is necessarily better than what came before.
723640	724920	I just don't think it's true.
724920	726280	I think that's nonsense.
726920	731560	Like, we're looking at a massive historical event triggered primarily by technology.
732200	734280	Of course, there are going to be upsides and downsides.
737320	743560	Yeah, so I think it is absolutely the case that women now can be much more open about sexuality
743560	747320	and I'm more able to enjoy sex in certain circumstances and stuff.
747320	747880	That's true.
748600	756600	But I also think that to some extent, like, we're social animals and we're very responsive to norms.
757480	764600	And what I think has happened is kind of the norms have just spun on a sixpence.
764600	768440	And now, whereas previously, it would have been the case that young women, for instance,
768440	771960	were like protecting their virginity and their reputation for being chased and so on,
771960	774120	was considered very important socially.
774120	777720	Now, if anything, it's the opposite or not quite the opposite,
777720	782840	but that now the pressure actually is on for women to be up for it.
784520	787800	And to be just as sexually adventurous as the guys.
787800	791800	And, you know, like, it's like a slightly painful.
794040	797320	There's a contradiction within that, which is really hard to navigate for young women.
797320	803560	We're on the one hand, like, it's good to be sexually open.
803560	810200	It's good to sort of base your reputation on being really sexy,
810760	813800	but also there is actually a penalty if your body count is too high,
815000	816520	which is quite difficult.
816520	819640	And I think a lot of young women don't necessarily realise that as well.
819640	822040	Like, they're actually treading a really difficult tightrope,
823560	827000	which is why I think this idea of like, oh, well, people can do whatever they want now.
827000	830520	Like, you know, we're all free to behave as we want sexually.
830520	838920	I just don't think it's true, because every culture has expectations in relation to sex,
838920	841560	has norms in relation to sex.
841560	847080	I think that what we've done, though, is that we had some quite deeply embedded norms,
847080	849960	which were thrown out the windows of consequence of sexual revolution.
849960	853320	And now there's like a sort of halting effort to maybe rebuild them.
854280	861240	Sometimes they're implicit and it's kind of a wild west out there, basically.
864280	865560	Who's enforcing this, then?
865560	866520	Where's this coming from?
867080	873320	Are you suggesting that men are weaponising women to believe that they should have a particular type
873320	878200	of sexual proclivity that then plays into men's hands because they get more variety?
879080	880600	I don't think there's a conspiracy.
880600	882760	I don't think that anyone is enforcing it.
882840	887000	I think that it's just everyone, like, responding to incentives as individuals.
887960	893560	And that knits together to create the culture that we see before us.
893560	901960	So, like, yeah, it is in the interests of men who want to sleep around to encourage
902920	907160	women to match them, you know, in that kind of behaviour.
907160	909640	So that's clearly going on at an individual level.
909640	916120	But then in terms of, like, women's magazines encouraging their readers to do the same,
916120	920200	I have some, I did a lot of digging through women's magazines for this book.
920760	926840	And, like, there is some really grim articles out there.
926840	928680	What were your least favourite headlines?
929560	936840	I can't remember exactly the wording of it, but there's a whole genre of articles in women's
936920	940040	media about encouraging women not to catch feelings.
940040	947160	Or, I mean, the way that it's phrased is how anyone of any gender can not catch feelings
947160	951640	when they're having casual sex and how to have casual sex in, like, a fun, feminist way, etc, etc.
951640	956840	But, like, we know that women are much more likely to bond quickly with their sexual partners.
956840	959560	We know that they just much less likely to like casual sex.
961560	965320	Something that's really interesting and really marked difference to many women
966040	972200	on average in sexuality is women's sexual disgust threshold is a lot lower.
972200	976520	So women will get the ick much easier than men will.
977400	980120	But if you're going to participate, if you're going to have sex like a man,
980120	982440	you have to overcome all of those instincts, right?
982440	989480	And so there's a whole genre of women's mags that will basically, like, instruct their young readers
990200	995960	in how to suppress their instincts and have sex that actually they kind of know deep down
995960	999000	they shouldn't be having, which I think is really bleak.
1000040	1005160	And, yeah, and I think that just representing that is feminist in any way.
1006760	1012680	Interestingly, looking at it from a man's perspective, I agree that this is bad for women.
1012680	1014360	I don't think that it serves their interests.
1014360	1019080	I think that the biological predisposition that women have when it comes to sexual partners
1019160	1021320	trying to decouple having sex.
1021320	1024440	First off, having sex and making babies was decoupled.
1024440	1029240	But then having sex and having emotions getting attached was decoupled.
1029240	1032680	And that second one, the pill for that is, I mean, you know, what is it?
1032680	1034120	Is it 10 vodkas deep?
1034120	1035400	Like, does that really help?
1035400	1037240	You know, you wake up in the morning and you feel.
1037240	1044360	But you use this analogy about the fact that Marilyn Monroe was a sort of very attractive
1044360	1050120	woman that was weaponized, commercialized, utilized by a society that wanted to sexualize
1050120	1050600	women.
1050600	1055640	And this was at the benefit of Hughes, Hugh Hefner, the sort of high status man who
1055640	1058680	was able to sleep with lots of women and continue to do this.
1059800	1060680	I agree.
1060680	1061560	I think that you're right.
1061560	1065560	It is bad for women, but very few men are Hughes.
1065560	1072840	And what you're seeing in the modern society is this most women are probably dissatisfied
1072840	1078440	with the way that their sexual pursuits are going.
1079480	1084600	Most men now, the number of men reporting no sex between the ages of 18 and 30 has tripled
1084600	1087480	to nearly 30 percent in the last 10 years.
1087480	1090360	So the Matthew principle kicks off here.
1090360	1093800	So I think on average, it's bad for pretty much everybody.
1093800	1098920	I think that the sort of amount of sexual satisfaction has lowered for everybody.
1098920	1103160	And you have this huge underclass of sexless men, which is where incel, black pill, make
1103160	1106600	tau, some parts of the red pill, the manasphere, men's rights.
1107400	1113400	All of these movements are, as far as I can see, they're big copes from men who are now
1113400	1118760	in a sort of sexual wasteland where they're really, really struggling to find connection.
1118760	1123320	So I think that it's, I understand that from a feminist perspective, it is bad for women
1123320	1124920	and that there are higher costs that they pay.
1125560	1131960	But being a listless, liminal space man with no desire from any female that you give your
1131960	1134280	attention to is not a good situation to be in either.
1135320	1136280	Yeah, I completely agree.
1136920	1137320	Yeah.
1137320	1141400	I'd add to that things like rates of erectile dysfunction among young men are like insanely
1141400	1146440	high, which is probably suited for maybe also to do with Easter eggs in the environment.
1146440	1146920	I don't know.
1146920	1147880	God damn Easter eggs.
1147880	1151800	So I was eating some edamame beans the other day and everyone at the table who's like big
1151800	1153560	into health and fitness look disgusted.
1153560	1156120	Apparently, edamame beans have got tons of estrogen in.
1156120	1156600	Who knew?
1156600	1158440	You can have a bit of soy, can't you?
1158440	1159560	That's probably it.
1159560	1160920	Don't go into the soy argument.
1160920	1162920	But yeah, a few men are used, right?
1162920	1164600	So they're the ones that are losing.
1164600	1166360	Yeah, no, this is completely true.
1166360	1173640	And I think as well that there's this like antagonism between feminists and let's say
1173640	1181400	incels broadly, which does I think very much come down to these innate differences to male
1181400	1185240	and female sexuality and the fact that we don't really talk about them enough,
1186360	1191640	which means I think that you end up with the sex is really misunderstanding each other.
1191640	1192200	Right?
1192200	1199880	So like feminists will look at incels and like completely not understand why it would be
1199880	1202040	so frustrating to be a young man who can't get laid.
1202040	1207800	Like I think a lot of women are like surprising and clueless about male sexuality in all sorts
1207800	1208440	of ways.
1208440	1213240	Like definitely the dark side of male sexuality, but also just like its intensity.
1213240	1219800	I think most women cannot just can't like directly empathize at all.
1219800	1224040	And similarly incels I think would look at women and be like, but you can walk out into
1224040	1228440	the street and pick up half feels and guys, you know, within five minutes, you must be
1228440	1230440	living heaven on earth and women like, but I don't want that.
1230440	1231960	And so you end up with this.
1231960	1237240	Everyone thinks that like the other the other side has it easy, which has a lot to do with
1237720	1242280	of just this like these quite fundamental biological differences, making it hard for
1242280	1244120	us to empathize with one another.
1244120	1250200	And this is added to a culture in which like not only are those sexuality differences
1250200	1255000	routinely denied, but like the the existence of sexual dimorphism is routinely denied.
1255800	1260040	It's like, how can you possibly like successfully navigate the sexual landscape if you don't
1260040	1261240	even think many women exist?
1262040	1263160	That's just great categories.
1264200	1266040	Do you think that inventing the pill was an error then?
1268200	1269800	No, because I think.
1272520	1274360	I mean, socially, no, like that there are.
1276440	1279720	Mary Harrington will probably talk to you about the environmental consequences of the pill.
1280600	1283640	And yeah, we've just mentioned each other and that's like that's another story.
1283640	1286120	Socially, I think no, I mean, I think it is.
1287320	1291480	I'm personally grateful for the fact that my life is not entirely dominated by childbearing,
1291480	1293880	which it would have been in a previous era.
1293880	1297320	I'm not going to expect to have 10 children and to spend my whole life either pregnant
1297320	1298040	or postpartum.
1300200	1305160	I think it's more that we haven't really negotiated with the social consequences.
1306600	1307640	And that's what I'm trying.
1307640	1311800	That's the sort of conversation I'm trying to initiate because we, you know, we have,
1311800	1312760	we have the power to.
1312760	1317960	I'm not like a complete, I have a sort of materialist analysis of all of this.
1317960	1323160	And I think in the end, it does come down to things like the pill,
1323160	1324760	things like changes in the economy.
1324760	1331240	You know, I think so often you get the popular narrative of feminist history
1331960	1339080	is basically sees it as being driven by particularly inspiring feminists
1339880	1344040	who just kind of give really strong arguments and everyone's persuaded.
1344040	1345880	And this is what, you know, this is what gives us the vote.
1345880	1348040	This is what gives us access to professions, whatever.
1348040	1348840	I don't think that's true.
1348840	1351960	I mean, clearly there have been some very impressive feminists historically.
1351960	1356040	But I think that the real story of the last century is things like the washing machine.
1356040	1359560	Yeah, you said the washing machine helped deliberate women more than any feminist did.
1360360	1362440	Yeah, I think Jordan Peterson said the same thing.
1362440	1363320	He's completely right.
1364600	1365960	He also mentions tampons.
1365960	1370600	Yeah, there's all sorts of, all sorts of technologies which make it possible for women
1370600	1373640	to have lives outside of their home or more outside of their home than previously.
1375160	1378600	And also changes to the economy, which means that, you know, if you're in a
1379240	1384280	in a knowledge economy or a service economy where male physical strength doesn't have anything
1384280	1389800	like the economic importance that it once did, women and men can participate basically as equals.
1390360	1393320	You know, there are there are like, obviously childbearing makes a difference.
1393320	1396040	But if you're if you're on the pill, you're delaying childbearing.
1397400	1404360	You're working at a laptop and you're operating in a very kind of gender neutral social sphere.
1405320	1409240	You might not even you might not even like work out.
1409240	1412280	You might have no recognition of the fact that men and women are
1412280	1414360	profoundly physically different in terms of things like strength.
1415160	1418680	Like from that perspective, it looks as if the whole world is gender neutral.
1421000	1428600	And so that's kind of that's that is the sort of social context in which this idea of the
1429000	1434680	the difference between men and women being socially constructed or being trivial makes sense.
1436200	1441480	But actually, that's like a very, very superficial analysis of what's going on.
1441480	1445160	But actually, I mean, one of the physical differences is still profound, but also
1445160	1447560	like those psychological differences go really deep.
1448440	1453000	Because we're talking about hundreds of thousands of years of evolutionary history
1453720	1456680	feeding into us having these really distinct reproductive roles and that
1457560	1461640	and that leading to us having quite different modes of sexuality.
1462600	1471000	Didn't you say that the USA women's football team was beaten by the Dallas under 15s football team?
1471560	1479000	Yeah, yeah, there are like several examples of this of elite women's teams being beaten by
1479000	1480040	teenage boys.
1480040	1486040	I think that the the fastest woman in the 100 meters on the planet gets beaten by
1486840	1492680	about 100 or 200 under 17s in America, 200 under 17 men in America.
1492680	1501160	I mean, the whole like the discussion around male and female physical strength differences
1501720	1507400	are purely due to the fact that girls get told that they need to play with dolls and guys go
1507400	1509640	and lift lift little trucks and stuff.
1510520	1515400	It feels like lapping to me, it feels like everybody is living this sort of charade
1515400	1519960	and nobody can bear themselves to to pull out of it like that's wild.
1519960	1523400	But when it comes to the psychological differences, there's a little bit more,
1524440	1529240	I guess, plausible room for manoeuvre there because you can't see the manifest as much.
1529240	1533000	And when you've also got a discussion about people being able to transition from
1533640	1538520	different genders, the male brain and the female brain and traits that you put them on
1538520	1539720	and take them off like clothes.
1540680	1545320	Yeah, and there are outliers, you know, there are there are like less so physically.
1545320	1548920	I mean, you do sometimes get really strong women or whatever.
1548920	1555720	But even then, I mean, I do my husband and I are both power lifters and just I don't think
1555720	1562520	that you can spend five minutes in a power lifting gym and not be aware of the fact that
1562520	1566120	men and women strength differences are massive, even if there are obviously some really strong
1566120	1566520	women.
1566520	1568120	Do you pull conventional or sumo?
1568200	1568840	Conventional.
1568840	1569960	What about the husband?
1569960	1571240	Also conventional.
1571240	1571960	Good.
1571960	1573400	It's a family of non-cheaters.
1573400	1575240	I'm adamant that sumo is cheating.
1577240	1581560	Yeah, I mean, and then I see I've been, you know, trading this for years and then I see
1581560	1589560	like novice men warming up with my one red max and then it's just it's just like the
1589560	1590840	pure reality of it.
1590840	1594280	But I mean, if people don't participate in those kind of sports, also things like martial
1594280	1596360	arts, if you don't participate in that, you wouldn't.
1596360	1597480	necessarily know it.
1598600	1602280	But on the psychological differences, yeah, there are there are more outliers.
1602280	1607240	There are some people who are really atypical for their sex and there clearly is like a lot
1607240	1610360	of space for culture to intervene.
1612840	1617080	But it's so on an individual level, if you know what, if you know someone's sex, you
1617080	1619880	don't necessarily know anything really about their personality.
1620680	1624360	It's more that at the population level, when you're talking about millions of people,
1624520	1626520	that's when you see it play out.
1626520	1632520	And like something that is really interesting and really makes clear that how profound these
1632520	1637400	differences are is you look at things like university campuses and look at their sex
1637400	1642600	ratio on campuses where there are more women than men.
1642600	1644520	So men are the rarer sex.
1645080	1649560	There's more hookup culture because the rarer sex is able to set the terms more easily.
1649560	1654280	And then on campuses where there are more women than men, so men are the rarer sex.
1654360	1657080	There are more men than women, you have the inverses, more monogamy.
1658040	1661480	And that's the sort of thing where, yes, there will be individual outliers,
1661480	1665640	but you can't deny the differences when you when you see it playing out in those kind of larger
1666360	1666920	arenas.
1667640	1673880	Well, that sex ratio hypothesis is kind of the basis as well for a ton of hypergamy,
1673880	1678840	that as you have an ever increasing group of high-performing women and an ever decreasing
1678840	1683000	group of underperforming men that are dropping out of college, that aren't getting as educated,
1683080	1689160	women age 21 to 29 earn 1,111 pounds more on average than the equivalent man.
1689160	1692360	So during the period when women are seeking a mate,
1692360	1697800	they're unable to find what fundamentally on average women want to find a mate that is
1697800	1701400	more statusful, wealthier and better educated than they are.
1701400	1705960	Those are the cues typically that they were attracted to, but now women are able to gain
1705960	1709560	status, earn more and become better educated than men at higher rates than men,
1709560	1715960	which is what's causing this sort of upward tilt toward turbo chad at the top sleeping with everybody,
1717080	1723880	listless, sexless men underclass down here, and then the wistful women and alpha widows
1723880	1725640	that are in this sort of world.
1725640	1731480	I mean, this is the most interesting dynamic that I think there is at the moment when it
1731480	1732280	comes to dating.
1732280	1734680	It's got downstream implications economically.
1734680	1738040	It's got downstream implications when you think about population growth,
1738040	1740680	population decline, culture, crime.
1741480	1745000	You don't want this huge underclass of sexless men roaming the streets.
1745000	1747720	When you get into a relationship as a man, your testosterone goes down.
1747720	1751720	When you have a child, your testosterone goes down again, because it's advantageous,
1751720	1755720	it's adaptive for you to not be going out doing reckless shit when you've got a baby
1755720	1757400	and a wife at home to look after.
1757400	1762280	So all of this, I mean, this is just, it is by far the most interesting dynamic,
1762280	1763880	I think, that's happening in the world at the moment.
1764840	1766680	Yeah, and this is the subject of it.
1766680	1770920	So my last chapter is called Marriage is Good, and a lot of people who've just seen
1770920	1776680	the contents page sort of assumed that it's a Christian argument or whatever.
1776680	1782760	But actually, it's making exactly, it's like a very rational, secular argument for actually,
1782760	1787800	if you look at what happens to a society when you get rid of monogamous marriage and you
1787800	1793080	compare our society and as it was in the past, and also look at societies where
1793080	1795320	polygony is the norm.
1795320	1800440	Like most society, I think it's about 80% of societies on the anthropological record
1800440	1804760	have had polygony as a socially acceptable thing.
1804760	1811800	So you end up with the chads who are having multiple wives, and then you've got men who
1811800	1812920	never marry at all.
1812920	1817000	And you do also have some monogamy in the middle, like it's normally not quite that extreme.
1817000	1821560	But that, it seems, is basically our natural state as a species.
1822520	1825560	And because it just, it just recurs again and again and again.
1826200	1832520	And that minority of cultures that have been monogamous, including Western cultures, are
1832520	1837400	unusual, but and it's not like it does sort of have to be imposed.
1837400	1842120	Like, you know, like a lot of elite men will cheat, for instance.
1842120	1844600	And, you know, they take on extra wives that they could.
1844920	1849080	People, monogamy is not really our natural state.
1849080	1854040	It does have to be socially enforced, but it also is like amazingly successful.
1855000	1859640	Anthropologists talk about the puzzle of monogamous marriage in that it is weird to see that
1861480	1864360	a culture like ours would have developed it in the first place because it clearly doesn't
1864360	1865640	suit the interests of elite men.
1865640	1868520	You'd think that the elite men would want would want to have multiple wives, which of
1868520	1869160	course they do.
1870200	1874120	But the reason they think that it's become as successful as it has is because monogamous
1874200	1875160	societies do well.
1875880	1876520	More stable.
1877560	1878440	They're more stable.
1878440	1880680	They're also more productive.
1880680	1883960	So they colonize other parts of the world, basically, because they're
1884600	1887160	wealthy and, you know, striving and successful.
1887160	1889080	And then they impose their marriage norms elsewhere.
1889800	1890520	Think about it this way.
1890520	1891720	I've only just thought about this.
1893480	1895880	The naturalistic fallacy gets used a lot with this, right?
1895880	1900760	Look, ancestrally, we maybe don't have tons of evidence that we're a monogamous species.
1900760	1903560	Their form of monogamy is not the strategy that we're supposed to go down.
1904520	1909080	If you accept the fact that non-monogamous societies are more unstable and are going to
1909080	1912520	exist for a lesser amount of time, that means that the living standards are going to be
1912520	1912760	lower.
1912760	1915800	That means that mortality or all of the things that you care about, right,
1915800	1916920	are going to be out of the window.
1918360	1924280	What if monogamy for the individual sometimes can be suboptimal,
1924280	1927240	but on average is optimal for the culture as a whole?
1927240	1931240	In the same way as when seatbelts got introduced, people didn't want to wear them.
1931240	1933800	And a lot of the time it's not just you that you're saving.
1933800	1936680	It's also other people in the car because if you don't have your seatbelt on,
1936680	1939000	you bounce around and you smash up everybody else as well.
1940040	1947080	Maybe a different way to frame monogamy is that it's kind of like following the law
1947080	1947720	a little bit.
1947720	1954040	It's a small individual sacrifice that you make that does perhaps make for some people
1954600	1956680	suboptimal living standards, but only a little bit.
1957400	1963640	But the reason that you do that is to contribute to the entire stability of society.
1964760	1967560	Yeah, I've heard, I can't remember who came up with this,
1967560	1972760	but I've heard monogamy referred to as sexual socialism, basically that reason.
1972760	1974520	It's a redistribution strategy for sure.
1974520	1978520	Yeah, yeah, I mean, I mean, we mentioned Jordan Rees again.
1978520	1980840	He got in trouble for saying something along these lines.
1980840	1981480	I can't remember exactly what it was.
1981480	1982520	Enforced monogamy.
1982520	1984680	I brought it up with them at the start of the year.
1985880	1990280	Yeah, because it sounds really authoritarian, but I think what he was describing there is
1990280	1992680	basically a weird describing where it's like socially prescribed.
1992680	1995160	It's not even necessarily legally required.
1995160	1997240	It's just considered to be the norm.
1997240	1998520	Cheating is considered to be bad.
1999080	2000120	You can't have a second wife.
2002760	2006600	And yeah, I mean, there are other good outcomes also in terms of things like child abuse and
2006600	2010360	domestic violence, which obviously something feminists are very interested in.
2011560	2016440	Like polygynous societies have much higher rates of both because the household with
2016440	2021240	multiple wives and their children are like full of conflict.
2021480	2026600	A hundred times more likely that a child is going to be killed if they're in the household
2026600	2029240	with one parent that isn't their biological parent.
2029240	2029560	Yeah.
2029560	2031160	A hundred times more likely.
2031720	2033640	Yeah, yeah, it's insane.
2034280	2034840	It's wild.
2034840	2037800	Okay, so what's sexual disenchantment?
2039320	2049240	So social disenchantment is basically, I took it from Max Weber, the sociologist who wrote about
2051240	2053960	disenchantment of the natural world as part of the Enlightenment.
2053960	2059800	So when people used to believe pre-enlightenment that the natural world was kind of possessed
2059800	2065640	by spirits and had like agency and specialness like infused within it.
2065640	2069960	And then we become more rational, whatever, opposed to enlightenment and realised actually
2069960	2072680	it's all just like scientific forces of play.
2073720	2075960	I think that it's not my turn.
2075960	2079080	I borrowed it from Aaron Sabar, an American writer.
2079800	2085080	Sexual disenchantment is what happens post-sexual revolution where you used to think of sex as
2085080	2086440	having this kind of specialness.
2086440	2093400	I mean within Christianity of being like a sacrament within marriage and then now it's
2093400	2099800	stripped of all of that meaning and it just becomes basically any old social interaction.
2099800	2101800	Like it's just a means of having fun.
2101800	2103400	Basically, it doesn't necessarily mean anything.
2103400	2107160	I mean, the point that I'm making the book is actually basically no one really believes
2107160	2108440	in sexual disenchantment.
2108440	2113240	People talk about it a lot and particularly like progressives and liberal feminists will
2113240	2116920	talk about it as if it's an ideal.
2116920	2121320	Like we should of course get rid of all these like stupid old fashioned ideas about sex,
2121320	2124440	having some like innate specialness.
2125800	2131080	But actually people don't really behave as if that's true because people behave almost always
2131080	2136200	as if actually sex does have a special status and it's a special status you can't necessarily
2136200	2139320	define very easily but people feel it.
2139320	2146040	Like people care if they get cheated on even in the polyamorous community.
2146040	2152120	Like if you go into any polyamorous subreddit or whatever, you will find people really struggling
2152120	2156760	with jealousy as this like intense instinctive thing that they're trying to override and they
2156760	2157480	can't quite do it.
2158840	2161320	People, I mean it's sexual harassment in the workplace.
2162280	2169320	I get really frustrated with feminists who claim simultaneously that sex workers work
2170120	2176200	and that we should like get rid of all these hang-ups about selling sex being any different
2176200	2179960	from working at McDonald's or selling any other kind of service.
2179960	2186040	But then they also get so sensitive about any perceived section of propriety in their workplace.
2186360	2187000	What like?
2188680	2190600	Like being touched by a boss for instance.
2190600	2196040	Like not even in a like a really aggressive assaulting way but just you know women getting
2196040	2200280	touched on the arm or something like that or being asked out in a context that you don't really
2200280	2201000	feel comfortable.
2201000	2203560	You know all that kind of me too stuff which is quite low level.
2205320	2210360	Like if that if it's really the case that sex workers work then what is the problem with being
2210360	2212120	asked by your boss to give them a blow job?
2213000	2220120	Right it's work, it's just a service, it's like being asked to do it over time or make a coffee.
2220120	2224840	Or make a coffee yeah and no one actually thinks that that it's just like making a coffee.
2224840	2229080	So I think that the sexual disenchantment idea is really just theoretical.
2229960	2235720	It's a rhetorical kind of move but actually doesn't really describe reality and doesn't
2235720	2237480	really describe how people feel.
2237480	2244040	I mean it's kind of just an inconvenient fact that if you're trying to be super rational
2244040	2250120	and you're trying to resist anything like remotely traditional or religious or you know
2253320	2259080	anything old fashioned then the fact that people feel very differently about sex and
2259080	2261960	they do about other things is kind of inconvenient.
2261960	2263560	It's felt like an aberration right?
2263640	2269720	It's like oh this is just an analogy drawn with the non monogamy community is so correct.
2269720	2273000	One of my friends out here in Austin was telling me about the first time that his
2273000	2278840	wife brought somebody else back and he was on the floor of the bathroom dry retching.
2279720	2286040	But at the time he's now married at the time was adamant that this was just him working
2286040	2291080	through his ego and this is in part of the process this is part of the processing thing.
2291080	2296280	I'm like dude that's you're not choosing to throw up that's something way way way
2296280	2301800	behind conscious programming that's innate that's built in but is it you that is this
2301800	2305080	your quote that says few liberal feminists are willing to draw the link between the
2305080	2309240	culture of sexual hedonism they promote and the anxieties of a campus rate that have
2309240	2311000	emerged at the exact same time?
2312040	2320040	Yeah yeah that's yeah yeah because I think what's going I think what's going on a lot
2320120	2327640	with me too is that what what meets what was described during me too and still is I guess
2327640	2333960	I mean it's still it's still going on in different forms right was not always right right like some
2333960	2338360	so with like going back to Weinstein for instance some of what he did was like straightforwardly
2338360	2344200	illegal and he was convicted of it therefore but a lot of what is described is much more
2345080	2350760	somewhere in the middle you know much more open to interpretation and often what women were talking
2350760	2357000	about was just like feeling creeped out or feeling like like exactly this dry retching on the bathroom
2357000	2362840	floor feeling like your instincts are telling you something even if you can't quite rationalize it
2363560	2370200	and often this was like expressed in terms of consent because in the liberal feminist
2370920	2375560	framework the only thing you're really allowed to talk about is consent because you because
2376200	2379480	all the old-fashioned norms are out the window you're not allowed to talk about chivalry you're
2379480	2386840	not allowed to talk about um like any kind of instinctive feeling of disgust or discomfort
2386840	2391720	that you have kind of has to be suppressed but you are allowed to talk about consent and so
2391720	2396120	everything had to be expressed in the form in like the language of consent so I talk about for
2396120	2401720	instance the Aziz Ansari case you might remember I can't remember the name of the grace I think was
2401720	2408360	her her pseudonym this woman who went on a date with the actor Aziz Ansari went back to his house
2408360	2413800	afterwards and he kind of he didn't rape her and he didn't do anything illegal but he just kind of
2413800	2419560	subtly pressured her into doing sex things that she didn't really want to do and then later she
2419560	2426120	wrote a sort of first-hand account of this um and he got in trouble but it was one of those
2427240	2430520	it was it was a bit later on in me too and it was one of those ones that provoked a lot of
2430520	2434120	discussion because it was because it was a borderline one like he hadn't had he done anything
2434120	2440200	wrong he definitely hadn't done anything illegal um the idea that he hadn't that he had violated her
2440200	2445880	consent just didn't really stack up just based on her own story I think what's often going on here
2445880	2451320	is it's to do with this pressure that women feel to have sex like men
2453240	2458440	and to try and have emotionless sex and to try and just like you know to do the sexual
2458440	2464200	disengagement thing and just treat it like a like a leisure activity but they can't actually quite
2464200	2470200	do it and they feel like they feel sexual disgust they feel shame they feel like these deep painful
2470200	2477160	emotions and the only person sometimes to blame is the man even though he actually might not have
2477160	2481320	done anything wrong really or he I mean he probably wasn't behaving like a gentleman
2481960	2486120	but he wasn't doing anything illegal and he wasn't doing anything really wrong according to like
2486840	2491800	the the standards of the day it's just that the standards of the day are not actually very good for
2491800	2497640	women that's it you've nailed it you've absolutely nailed it there and you're right the the outlet
2497640	2504360	for pushback and and for distaste the only one that is there is the man and the only
2504360	2509320	framing through which you can talk about this is consent which is where false allegations I think
2509320	2517800	sometimes come in that perhaps you repurpose ick as guilt as it must have done something criminal
2517800	2524520	yeah now it's rape yeah and of course the nature of it is that there are only two people there
2524520	2529480	there weren't any witnesses and so it's everyone's like analysis of something that's gone in the past
2529480	2534760	is just really difficult and you know to be fair to a lot of men they're being
2537240	2541640	they're being raised in the same culture where you're told that this is that women love it you
2541640	2546920	know they I mean they haven't necessarily watched like Sex and the City but it's the same it's the
2546920	2553640	same milieu where you wear like having sex like a man is aspirational and the idea is I write a
2553640	2559720	lot in the book about pop culture examples of women who are clearly aspirational fictional characters
2560760	2565240	who have loads of casual sex love it like don't have any emotional connection to the men
2565880	2570520	that they use for sex and this is this is like this is this is aspirational you know and so and
2570520	2574520	and young men are seeing this as well and they're also watching porn which gives a completely
2574520	2581640	unrealistic realistic perspective on what women like and so you know they're clueless basically
2581640	2585720	they're playing by the rules of the game as well or at least by the cultural influences of the game
2585720	2592520	that they think are going on another another problem that you have here in the asymmetric warfare of
2592520	2598440	the sexes is that men who begin to get a little bit of resentment for women let's say that they've
2598440	2603320	had the heart broken in the past but that they are within the standard where they can keep having
2603320	2606680	sex right they're not one of the underclass they're actually someone that can keep on doing it
2607480	2611960	if they become aware of the fact that girls are trying to play this game of detached
2611960	2617080	emotionless sex if they fully become conscious of that they go oh okay let's see who can win at
2617080	2621960	this game the most because it's not going to be you it's going to be me and they can you know this
2621960	2625560	isn't to say again on average this isn't to say that some men don't get attached after the first
2625560	2631640	time they have sex so they go some of my friends fall pretty hard but they if they can weaponize
2631640	2638200	that they can do a ton of damage as well and yeah i i don't know there's maybe an argument
2638200	2643160	that everybody just needs to not be able to have sex until the age of 25 and then when they do
2643160	2648200	they're like look i'm fully emotionally balanced i've been through a bunch of breakups i didn't
2648200	2652920	have sex during the during the relationship i kind of know what i like and what i don't like
2653880	2657880	i don't know i it's just so many describing there is marriage chris
2660280	2663880	that used to be what it was you weren't allowed to have sex before you got married
2664840	2669960	which gave which gave like men in particular a massive incentive to get their shit together
2671240	2677800	because if you can't if you can't get married until you've say like achieved certain adult
2677800	2684760	things like you've got a job you've got a house you know or like you've got whatever the system is
2684760	2690280	like a certain amount of money that you can demonstrate your sort of eligibility as a husband
2690280	2695240	if you have to get all of your ducks in a row before you can have sex i mean you can potentially
2695240	2701960	buy sex but you can't have it like socially illicit then that that's a huge incentive
2702680	2709480	to behave yourself and to do pro-social stuff whereas if you have a scenario now where either
2710680	2717000	either you're like attractive enough that you can get sex casual sex without having to
2717640	2722920	to do anything really except be like moderately charming or you can get sex
2724280	2727560	through all you all you have access to porn which like gives you the
2727960	2734200	of gives some of the same like feedback from your environment as if you were actually having sex
2734200	2738920	like i mean this would get so this will get so much worse with sex robots
2740040	2744600	where all of a sudden you can like basically bypass all of the effort that you might historically
2744600	2749400	have had to put in in order to access sex you can just buy a sex robot and you can spend your whole
2749400	2756840	life playing video games never going to gym never showering never having a job and you still
2756840	2761080	get access to this thing that your ancestors like fought teeth and nails to get access to
2761720	2767640	even without the sex robots men are retreating i think from from the dating market terrifying
2768440	2774040	terrifying rates there's a quote that rob henderson came up with which is this a similar
2774040	2778920	sort of dynamic that we're talking about here says norms were loosened around being an absentee
2778920	2783400	father so more men took the option but nobody wants to admit it because it upsets people
2783400	2787720	instead we retreat to discussions of poverty and economics because talking about family and
2787720	2794120	parenting makes people feel weird and judgmental but young men will only do what's expected of them
2794120	2799800	and a lot did use to be expected there were social norms to work hard provide take care of loved ones
2799800	2806120	and so on today these norms have largely dissolved young men have responded accordingly yeah he's
2806120	2812760	very very smart rob henderson he's completely right um yeah i mean i think that i think that the
2814200	2817160	the line i have in the book about debbie dad's is that when
2819320	2823720	when motherhood became a biological choice for women fatherhood became a social choice for men
2824360	2830840	what do you mean by that in the when contraception and legalized abortion became available
2831480	2837880	i mean that basically killed the shotgun marriage pretty much immediately because it no longer
2837880	2846520	served the same social purpose that it had before um but the nature of contraception is such that
2846520	2852120	nothing is 100% foolproof and actually the pill particularly in its earliest incarnations wasn't
2852120	2857320	that great and still isn't that great because it depends a lot on the user using it properly so if
2857320	2863400	you're using it properly it's like 99 plus effective but in reality it's more like 91 so you
2863400	2867160	end up with a lot of unplanned pregnancies and there will always be someone who don't want to
2867160	2873400	have a termination for whatever reason um but if you're in a social context where like
2875560	2878920	there isn't necessarily considered to be a link between sex and reproduction
2878920	2885400	and getting pregnant is considered to be like this unwelcome aberration rather than literally the
2885400	2892120	whole point then it becomes much more socially acceptable for men to not stick around because
2892120	2899480	they say well you chose this you know you're on your own which is yeah i mean obviously there have
2899480	2904440	always been cases of people i've had some critics pointing this out you know they've always been
2904440	2909640	cases of men abandoning their wives or abandoning women that they think that they made pregnant
2909640	2913320	outside of marriage you know they've always been scandals they've always been unwanted
2914040	2920440	pregnancies whatever like that's absolutely true but rates of out of wedlock births now are
2920440	2925240	completely historically unprecedented which is kind of weird because you would think that
2925880	2930440	giving women the technology that enables them to control their fertility would reduce single
2930440	2935240	motherhood but it's done the opposite because humans are humans are complicated creatures
2935240	2941000	that's what i learned from mary harrington that you introduce the pill single single motherhood
2941000	2947000	goes up like who the fuck could have predicted that right you know that's four degrees of detachment
2947000	2958520	away you know it's so interesting but also kind of tragic but it's it seems like women it was it
2958520	2963720	was a perfect storm right you had the the decoupling socially then you had the decoupling
2963720	2970200	biologically but you haven't had the decoupling emotionally it's still that
2971400	2974920	fundamentally there will be some women that are able to have sex like a man
2974920	2978200	and there will be some able there's a man the men that are able to have sex like a man
2978200	2982520	but on average it used to be something that you work toward for a long time it used to be the
2982520	2987720	sort of thing and think about now i was uh sent another article by rob the other day where he
2987720	2997400	was talking about why is it that parents tend to select when when their daughter or son brings
2997400	3004680	home a new potential partner they look at things like job title earnings family and he asked why
3004680	3008840	is that the case why is it that you look at these when you know they're not looking at how hot they
3008840	3014440	are not looking at a detraction and stuff like that even kindness kind of takes a little bit of a
3014440	3020520	back seat and it's less falsifiable basically the fact is look these are the things that are
3020520	3029720	going to be the most likely to become grandchild optimizing algorithms do you have status do you
3029720	3034840	have money do you have the right family behind you if you've got those i'm probably gonna have
3034840	3041320	grandchildren all of the other ones are wishy washy and and kind of easy to to fake in a way
3042040	3047400	um why why is it then that loveless sex isn't empowering
3051960	3060680	yeah i mean because because your animal brain which none of us are completely in control of
3062040	3067240	for women in particular even if there are some allies as you mentioned i mean often the outliers
3067240	3071720	like often women who who don't get attached to sex for instance have like a history of sexual
3071720	3076200	trauma there's often not a very healthy reason behind it but you know like accepting the fact
3076200	3082200	that there are outliers your animal brain thinks that this guy is going to knock you up and like
3082200	3090600	you are going to become a profoundly vulnerable mother baby dyad you know like human infants are
3090600	3098040	insanely vulnerable they need so much more care than any other as far as i know any other species
3098040	3105800	young um and mothers are also extremely vulnerable in the later stages of pregnancy and in and during
3105800	3111400	infancy you have to put so much energy and sacrifice so much in order to raise this child
3111400	3118920	to adulthood and that before like five minutes ago in our evolutionary history was what happened
3118920	3125480	or was certainly what you risked happening if you had sex had heterosexual sex and so
3126600	3134280	like our brains are still primed for that and that's the whole that's the whole purpose behind
3135400	3140360	emotional attachment to a sexual partner and also the whole purpose behind like choosing
3140360	3145640	your sexual partner and the fact that women do tend to be a lot choosier than men there's these
3145640	3152680	quite funny studies that have been done several times where they um they get like quite attractive
3152680	3157400	strangers to go up to men and women i think on university campuses normally in proposition them
3157400	3164040	and when the women proposition male strangers they almost always say yes or and if they say no it's
3164040	3168360	because they have a girlfriend or whatever whereas when the men proposition the women they always say
3168360	3177400	no because women like their filter is impregnable um and there's a reason for that it's because you
3177400	3183640	don't want some some like to be knocked up by some bozo it's just one of the reasons why prostitution
3183640	3188920	is as traumatic as it is i mean there are all there are all of the physical risk and bulging
3188920	3195560	prostitution like rates of murder are insanely high you know it's it's it's it's if we were to
3195560	3200040	compare it to another profession it would be by far the most dangerous profession ever like rates of
3200040	3205720	PTSD and much higher than in the military for instance but one of the reasons why it's so profoundly
3205720	3210040	distressing is that women have this really really strong instinct to like vet their sexual partners
3210040	3215240	and to only have sex with men who seem like good prospects and women also have a very heart a very
3215240	3221880	low sexual disgust threshold which means that they get the ick very readily with a man that they don't
3221880	3225880	fancy and what what women and prostitution are basically required to do is to override that
3226440	3231480	and to suppress those instincts if you talk to women who've who've experienced it they often
3231480	3237400	talk about like working really hard to dissociate from their physical feelings it is that is that
3237400	3241720	retching on the bathroom floor thing i mean actually retching maran whose prostitution
3241720	3246040	survivor and has written this amazing book called paid for it's a memoir of her experiences
3247080	3251160	she talks about that the fact that not vomiting is one of the most important skills a prostitute
3251160	3257560	can have because your your your physical urge to run away and to cry into vomit is that strong
3257560	3265800	that you have to like fight it down and i think that if you know in a much less extreme circumstances
3265800	3275320	obviously but when women are trying to like to to to play the masculine role and imitate male
3275320	3280280	sexuality and to enjoy sex in the way that they think they're supposed to they are basically
3280280	3284680	obliged to suppress their instincts which isn't isn't at all psychologically healthy
3285400	3291560	has normalising sex work like only funds been a benefit for women i mean they clearly are some
3291560	3296520	women are only fans who make a lot of money from it so there are some winners i mean
3298040	3305000	they they are very unusual most women on only fans probably make a loss in terms of the amount
3305000	3309480	of time they have to spend because the perito distribution on only fans is wild and most of
3309480	3314520	the women who do really well on it are already celebrities and already quite wealthy so this
3314520	3320280	idea that you can just be like as long as you're sufficiently pretty you log on and you're making
3320280	3325960	a fortune is not true and i'm sure has been deliberately whipped up that idea by only fans
3325960	3331400	because they're the only people actually really profiting at the end of the day um i mean i think
3331400	3336200	the only fans is not like street prostitution or brothel prostitution like it's clearly not the same
3336840	3344040	i like it's pretty gross and the and you will have men asking you to do things that really turn
3344040	3351640	your stomach but it's clearly not like physically dangerous i think that the main risk of only fans
3351640	3358280	is your ability to have a long-term relationship afterwards because you end up putting your images
3358280	3362360	out in the world and you can't get them back that's an issue of the internet and often only
3362360	3367480	fans creators get their images stolen and so they'll be shared and they don't even get any money from it
3368440	3376440	and the risk is in the future that even though men don't always admit it
3378120	3382760	the sexual double standard is still actually really alive and well if you so sexual double
3382760	3389320	standard being when men are kind of permitted to be a bit promiscuous and that's okay socially
3389320	3394760	but women tend to be punished for promiscuity i think that only fans goes beyond promiscuity
3394760	3400680	you know the double standard didn't account it's not men wanking on camera and then trying to find
3400680	3404920	a wife and them saying uh my friends shared something in a whatsapp chat earlier on and that
3404920	3415800	kind of looks a little bit like you what about um normalizing uh like love sex workers like sex
3415800	3422360	workers uh you should be completely fine with your partner doing only fans or perhaps even escorting
3423560	3430840	i mean crazy what kind of yeah i mean either i think if i think if a man is really comfortable
3430840	3437320	with that that's like a red flag to me honestly like again it's an example of men suppressing
3437320	3443880	their instincts because the the instinct towards jealousy is so strong and again has such an
3443880	3452360	obvious evolutionary origin to it um because if you're putting loads of resources into raising
3452360	3455720	children that you've had with this woman you want to know they're yours like that's
3455720	3462120	make guarding is what the um biologists call it and it's it's so common that i think it's
3462120	3468600	considered to be a human universal and yeah like there are there are loads of sort of unwelcome
3468600	3474440	phenomena that come from that you know jealousy is often um the motive behind domestic violence
3474440	3480280	for instance because i you know you mentioned the naturalistic fallacy like the fact that it's
3480280	3485400	natural doesn't mean it's necessarily good but it does also mean that trying to completely override
3485400	3489880	it is probably not gonna work like you have to find a way of accommodating your instincts you
3489880	3496360	can't just try and suppress them and try and like like rewrite the human blueprint well that's where
3497080	3502920	that's where i think the um it's not men that are encouraging women to do only fans
3503560	3510280	i don't see men on the internet saying that you should go and the you girl should ditch your
3510280	3515240	job and go and do it the only people online saying sex work is real work seems to be women
3515240	3520280	yes men are the ones that are paying for their images once they're in the game but i think
3521080	3526200	that's because once women cross that threshold and become a sex worker or whatever they're almost
3526920	3531720	kind of not subhuman but they're in a different category right and it's like oh well they're
3531720	3535240	doing it i didn't get them into it so i'm just going to continue to fund them but if you were to
3535240	3541400	say to most men i think would you advise that pretty girl to get into only fans so that you
3541400	3548280	can see her nudes most of them would say probably not probably not but almost every healthy man would
3548280	3552920	say no right they'd say no i'll try and go out with her or maybe she should just go and enjoy her
3552920	3557480	life or do whatever but once they're in the game that's what's going to happen but you have this
3557480	3564920	this very bizarre sort of cartel i don't know it's like uh self not self oppression but like
3566280	3571320	self capitalization from women of women encouraging other women to go and do the game
3571320	3573960	despite the fact that the chances of you making money on only fans is
3574760	3579640	minuscule low when it comes to actually making the tens of thousands of dollars a day that the
3579720	3587400	biggest creators make and yeah i mean even even if you were able to have an unbelievably secure
3587400	3593640	only fans that was never able to leak your photos online you have two choices for the remainder of
3593640	3597960	your life when you get into talking to a new partner you can either tell them the truth and
3599240	3603240	regardless of how comfortable that guy is with his sexuality finding out that his miss is
3603240	3609080	forget body count even if you've only slept with one other person but that was something that you
3609080	3617400	did you can't like left brain your way out of thinking that that is oh god well if she did that
3617400	3622120	in the past does this mean that she's maybe going to she's a risk for promiscuity in the future like
3622120	3627640	the cook radar is so hyper attuned for men which is why we get more jealous or the other one is to
3627640	3635800	lie to him cook radar is interesting praise good coinage game because i have you because i have
3635800	3642920	used the i've i've i've don't write it in the book but i um like talked about on twitter non-trader
3646040	3650680	i think that women have really strongly i mean i think men do as well but i think women in
3650680	3654840	particular have a really strong like it's i think it's hardly a sexual disgusting is that feeling
3654840	3660280	of like this guy is creepy and i think that it i think it's like female intuition right and i
3660280	3663640	think it's coming it's probably partly coming from wanting to protect yourself is also partly
3663640	3668600	wanting to protect your children you've got that like this guy's bad news yeah if i'm gonna sleep
3668600	3675080	with him what's he gonna do to the kids perhaps i saw i got to tell you about this uh meme that i
3675080	3681240	saw so carl benjamin sargon of a cad a guy who uh has incredibly conservative views about this stuff
3681240	3685320	but aligns completely with what we're saying here he posted a meme the other day and it had a girl
3685320	3689320	from only fans in like a bikini or laundry or whatever sort of dancing away on one side and
3689320	3694040	had michael scott from the office on the other sort of looking strangely and the text said
3695080	3699480	we call it female empowerment and they will dance naked for the price of a cheeseburger
3700840	3706760	yeah yeah i mean this question you raise about why women encouraging each other to do it you're
3706760	3710600	right i mean one exception i would give this idea of a friend who went on a date with a guy who said
3710600	3715800	you're so hot you should be on only fans and she did not go on a date with him again because it was
3715800	3722600	just so obviously i know failing strategy i think yeah because the way that she interpreted it and
3722600	3727960	i think correctly was that he was he was clearly not regarding her as like wife material right
3727960	3731880	and this is this is i think an error that women do make sometimes where they don't have a good
3731880	3737400	understanding of male sexuality and they don't it's really interesting i don't know if you read
3737400	3742680	david busser's book bad men i absolutely love it yeah i brought him on for this fantastic book yeah
3742680	3747480	and he talks about the fact that women tend to assess like short-term partners and long-term
3747480	3753240	partners based on the same uh qualities they want the same things in all the men they have
3753240	3758600	sex with men don't do that they have a much lower standard for their short-term partners and they do
3758600	3762360	for long-term partners and so they will be willing to have sex with a woman that they absolutely
3762360	3767080	would not marry they would not even introduce to their friends and i think a lot of women don't
3767080	3774440	necessarily know that and so they will interpret sexual advances from men as flattering when
3774440	3781160	actually they can are potentially like cheap you know this is the genesis of the alpha widow
3781160	3786840	right like this is what many girls that are liberated sexually and using tinder and stuff
3786840	3792680	like that don't get and i think that this is another i'm i'm actually not so convinced about
3792680	3798040	quite how big of an effect this is i'd need to see rob go and do some research about it
3798040	3802520	but certainly women are able to sleep with men that they wouldn't be able to get into a relationship
3802520	3808440	with but the reverse isn't true and there is an argument that the the aftershock of this means that
3808440	3814200	those women are going to constantly pine after the nine out of ten guy that's worth half a million
3814200	3822040	and all that i'm not sure about how long that would last for and the echoes of that and stuff
3822040	3827960	like that but i certainly think that um what porn has done to men which is to teach them that women
3827960	3833560	are to be objectified is similar in part to what only fans has done to women which is to teach
3833560	3840120	some women that men are commercial vehicles to be exploited and that their sex is just a
3841160	3848120	it's a commodity you can trade it like anything else yeah and it's not i think as well some women
3848120	3856280	who are already like posting a lot of raunchy photos on instagram don't necessarily feel like
3856280	3861480	only fans is that biggest step it's just a bit more explicit and you get paid for it so you can
3861480	3869560	sort of see the reasoning and what some women say and i i get it is that you know yes maybe that it
3869560	3872760	means that some men in the future wouldn't want to be in a relationship with me because i've got
3872760	3876600	these photos out in the world but i wouldn't want to be in a relationship with a man like that anyway
3876600	3879960	if he's going to judge me sort of thing and the problem with that is that if you actually look
3879960	3885560	at research on men it's like that's basically all men they might not say it because it's not
3885560	3890440	really socially acceptable to admit to but actually it is basically all men like to the point that
3890440	3897800	if a man isn't bothered i'd wonder if he had a cuckold fetish you know and then and then that
3897800	3901800	like obviously brings complications to your relationship what did you learn about porn
3901800	3911480	when you looked at that for the book i mean the thing with porn that i think a lot of people don't
3913320	3919400	fully appreciate is that online porn is a completely different beast from like playboy
3919400	3923880	of the 60s i mean i start the book by writing about playboy writing like you have no and clearly
3924840	3930360	like there were feminist writing at the time about porn being really grim for women there's
3930360	3935880	this famous cover of an issue of hustler i can't remember what year it was published in probably
3935880	3942600	the 70s where a woman is being like um ground up in a meat grinder and her legs are just
3942600	3948040	sticking out the top it's really like of like deliberately grotesque image and feminist got
3948040	3954440	so upset about it at the time i think rightly but like they had no idea what would happen
3954440	3963240	with the internet and i think that the thing that's so sinister about online porn is that
3964920	3971240	there's this there's this quote i use in the book that the nature of like
3971240	3977400	technical capitalism is that we are all either above the algorithm or below the algorithm we're
3978360	3984200	writing these we're either creating these these these pieces of tech or we're being influenced
3984200	3988760	by them because we're using them or we're you know sexually interacting with people who are
3988760	3994280	using them and porn is such an amazing example of this because it's just profit driven that's the
3994280	3999080	point of it it's not it's not interested in the well-being of its consumers i mean whatever
3999640	4006040	like porn have have various like advertising efforts to try and sanitize what they do but
4006920	4013640	the whole the whole point of it is making money and they're really good at it and the way that
4013640	4022440	they do it is by basically creating a super stimulus which adults uses brains and the like
4022520	4029160	they're incredibly adept at basically arousing the human body the human animal like we can't
4029160	4034600	really resist our animal instincts as quickly as possible so you log on to one of these platforms
4034600	4039960	and you look at the front page and like everything is designed to make you as horny as possible as
4039960	4050120	quickly as possible and the the way the platforms are designed is to like introduce you to the
4050200	4053960	super stimulus and then introduce it to something even more stimulating and even more stimulating
4053960	4059000	even more stimulating and so you end up and i mean so a lot of people are able to use porn
4059000	4063240	casually quite a lot of people don't use it at all like a surprising including men surprising
4063240	4068040	proportion do you know how much that is so i read a survey that about a quarter of millennial men
4068040	4077640	haven't used it in the last month which quite a lot but the the there's a minority of users
4077640	4084200	who are like helpless power users yeah yeah like again it's a burrito is a play as well like there
4084200	4089720	is a small number of men who watch i can't remember the cut the the figure i quote in the book it's
4089720	4094600	something like two percent of users use it for like seven hours a week or more it's a lot of porn
4094600	4101560	do you know um mary harrington's law of fap entropy yes whatever you start out wanking to
4101560	4105400	will get progressively more disgusting over time and you'll be down in the depths of blueberry
4105400	4112920	porn before you know it well yeah absolutely yeah i mean like just anecdotally there are some
4114520	4119880	very strange things that compulsory porn users end up being turned on by and like to the point
4119880	4125160	where they they can't even let erectile dysfunction being a huge problem they can't actually have
4125160	4130360	sex with a real person what's the name for that it's not ground pounding what's it called it's
4130360	4135640	it's called something oh death grip syndrome death ground pounding where the fuck did i pull
4135640	4142920	that from yeah death more unpleasant i mean death grip syndrome isn't that nice either yeah and i
4142920	4148440	write in the book about um cultural death grip syndrome which is where we've got an incredibly
4148440	4156200	pornified public life you've got so much more like sex scenes on tv advertising billboards whatever
4156200	4162120	i mean like sex scenes on tv have wrapped up so quickly just in my lifetime that used to be edgy
4162120	4168840	and now it's like you know every drama has to have like super super explicit sex scenes every five
4168840	4173240	minutes whatever so you've got that on the one hand well i don't think we've ever had this much
4173240	4178120	explicit sex in public life but then also people aren't actually having sex you have the sex recession
4178120	4183480	with sex depression where you've got as you were saying you've got loads of men who are virgins
4183560	4189800	up into their 20s and so on it's this really weird um what's the word
4191720	4196280	this is this really weird contradiction and it's one that the feminists of the 70s who were so upset
4196280	4202200	about porn didn't foresee interestingly like they were concerned that porn would inspire sexual
4202200	4208600	violence and like it's complicated because it probably does a bit like in some circumstances so
4208600	4216440	for instance choking porn has become so popular and is so mainstream in a way that it wasn't at
4216440	4221320	all 20 years ago it used to be considered a really niche media sim thing and even actually in the
4221320	4228600	BSN community was considered a bit risky whereas now like survey data is crazy for millennials and
4228600	4233720	younger the proportion of young women who report being choked by their partners um sometimes asking
4233720	4239160	for it and sometimes sometimes non-consensually but it's like just become insanely mainstream
4239160	4245880	really quickly and the only mechanism that i can see for that is porn that it's it's inspiring a
4245880	4257080	change in sexual culture so so sometimes yeah it's inspiring more aggressive behavior from its users
4258040	4264920	but equally actually sometimes it's like basically nuturing users that they become
4264920	4269080	actually incapable of having sex with real person and even becoming capable of being
4269080	4274360	aroused by just normal porn because they're so they'd like they go they go down the rabbit hole
4275480	4281880	Laura Pappentrum continues to yeah what do what do most modern feminists think about porn
4281880	4286760	now then do they think that it's liberating women and allowing them to earn and sex work
4286760	4290520	is real work it's complicated because i think that the
4292920	4296840	like most liberal feminists and sex positive feminists would definitely think that there's
4296840	4302760	nothing like inherently bad about porn and would absolutely defend the right of women to
4302760	4306360	produce it and so on but i think that there's increasingly a view that actually it's not
4307240	4314840	it's not great i did a um debate at the oxford union earlier this year and the the proposition
4314840	4319080	was something like this house welcomes a new porn it was mostly about the new fans but ended
4319080	4322440	up being about porn in general and i thought i'd be slaughtered because i thought that the
4323560	4326840	you know the students were going to be so sex positive and so anti everything i had to say
4326840	4331160	and actually i won surprisingly i had some quite aggressive questions from the floor
4331880	4337720	but actually at the end um our side one why do i think that was because i think actually
4337720	4343640	this generation i mean these 18 year olds right so they've or a bit older they they're the generation
4343640	4350280	who had porn like on their private computers on their phones from adolescence onwards i mean
4350280	4358680	i'm 30 so i didn't actually have my own smartphone or whatever until teens and above but these are
4358680	4363640	the kids who who had it from like adolescence and would would expect to be exposed to porn really
4363640	4372200	young and it was really formative in their sexuality and i think that it's hard not
4372200	4379640	to not to recognize the like the downsides of that the thing that i see online i don't know a
4379640	4385480	single guy that is pro porn guys are either neutral porn or anti porn like and the ones
4385480	4390920	that are anti porn are vehement about it do they tend to be anti porn from like
4392600	4397160	the ethical women stuff or because of the effect on them i can
4398120	4404520	not from the effect on women's stuff no um i think that i i i actually think that the guys
4404520	4409240	that are behaviorally addicted to porn or have got friends that do or are scared that they're
4409240	4416120	going to become it i actually think in part that they see the women that are um a part of the porn
4416120	4421560	machine as part of the oppressor i think that they think that they are creating the content which is
4421560	4428760	causing me to yeah i have to fap three or four times a day and and feel disgusted with myself or
4428760	4433000	waste time or you have this sort of super normal stimuli problem of not being able to get it up and
4434840	4440840	yeah i mean it's another one of those things where everybody's losing you know it except the
4440840	4446440	owners of mind geek they're fine yeah didn't one of those one of those went on a podcast a few years
4446520	4452440	ago i remember hearing about how huge that mind geek empire is it's like more than 50% of all
4452440	4457480	porn streaming on the internet goes through them remembering that porn is still the biggest
4458120	4464280	traffic source on the internet and they've got it's wild yeah i uh aren't they british
4464280	4469880	basically known one of the guys british as well i'm sure no i'm canadian the guy who only fans is
4469880	4474280	british yes yeah he's uh i was trying to get him on i was trying to bring him on because he seems
4474280	4478680	like a very interesting guy and i was really fascinated by their attempted move away from
4478680	4484520	explicit content it was obvious that they had i don't think that that came from altruistic means
4484520	4489800	i think that that came from probably investor problems and shit to do with banks so chelsea
4489800	4497160	ferguson if you know her she owns admiami.vip which is another version of only fans she was on only
4497160	4500760	fans she found out that it was a problem she's a friend i've been friends with her for a very long
4500760	4505080	time she was got a huge private snapchat she's been a stripper for a long time in newcastle
4505880	4509880	and she was telling me that she had to go to germany germany was the only place that she could
4509880	4515000	get a bank that would process payments when they found out what she was doing so the back end of
4515000	4519960	stuff i think that that was the the story about only fans wasn't that they were trying to clean
4519960	4524120	up the image it's that they were probably having investor problems and and operational shit on
4524120	4529800	the back end yeah interesting because that was one of the my memory of the timeline is that big
4529800	4536360	new york times piece about pawn hub and monkey came out and these are in particular possibly some
4536360	4544040	other companies i can't remember got a cold feet and thinking that they were inadvertently funding
4544040	4549240	child rape images and so i guess that that i mean i mean only fans has loads of kids on it
4550120	4555240	realistically and i know that they try they say that they try to make sure that it's only adults
4555240	4559480	but they can't realistically do that there are loads of stories anecdotally of girls
4560760	4566040	you know 14 15 year old girls whatever putting their images up there it is inevitable on any of
4566040	4570680	these platforms you can't really protect against it what do you mean when you say that people are
4570680	4577880	not products so that's yeah that's the when i mentioned at the beginning that i had that
4577880	4584920	big twitter storm about my uh about my chapter titles and that was kind of the most all these
4584920	4589320	like left-wing sex positive people absolutely outraged at me saying that people aren't products
4590280	4593960	i mean it comes back to the sexual disenchantment point that if you
4596120	4602040	if you really think that sex is meaningless it's just like making coffee blah blah blah
4602040	4607480	that people can just like sell sexual access to themselves like they'd sell any other kind of
4607480	4613800	service or any other kind of product like it's internally consistent and it's the sort of
4615320	4620520	the the phrase that i use in that chapter is that it's the logic of the punter i mean that's
4620520	4627320	what punters think that they can just they don't really see prostitute women as being properly human
4628120	4631880	i think i mean based on the way that they write about them that doesn't that doesn't seem to be
4631880	4639080	how they view them there's like appalling review platforms online where punters will review
4639800	4644280	women that they've bought sex from and there's like no human feeling in there like there's like
4644280	4650120	true psychopathy on display so so like that probably is the only population who actually
4650120	4657800	believe in sexual disenchantment um the women they're buying sex from certainly don't and
4659480	4666840	and like thinking away from the more extreme end of it in terms of prostitution as well just
4666840	4674680	thinking about things like dating apps which are also kind of designed like they're also sort of
4674680	4680120	continuous with the logic of the punter in that they are designed to be like shopping apps that's
4680120	4685240	how they feel you don't feel using them that different from using like asos or ebay or whatever
4685960	4691320	because you swipe swipe swipe and select your product um i mean or not of course if you're like
4691320	4696040	an incel who doesn't get any matches but for for for high status men and for women that is how it
4696040	4699560	that's how it's experienced and it's got a really really consumerist kind of
4700920	4706840	energy the cat the whole like casual sex phenomenon um which ought to be the sort of thing that the
4706840	4712040	left are really opposed to you know my my my colleagues at the new statesman like this ought
4712040	4717640	this ought to be you know we're talking about this multi-billion pound global empire of the
4717640	4721880	porn industry we're talking about a really consumerist attitude towards other people's
4722440	4727800	bodies and minds like this this this isn't conservative or it shouldn't be like this should be
4728520	4733960	101 anti-capitalist critique coming from the left but it isn't and i think that that's because
4735400	4743640	a lot of people on the left have prioritized like owning the comms and are more interested
4743640	4749960	in tearing down bourgeois sexual norms and basically promoting free love at all costs
4749960	4754040	than they are in thinking about where this has actually led to a led us to and i think that this
4755080	4761320	the last 60 70 years post sexual revolution period has been has been in a big experiment
4761320	4767880	in what happens if you disconnect sex from reproduction and you basically discard all
4767880	4775000	of the like quite finely tuned norms that used to exist basically to keep young horny people
4775000	4779720	away from each other i mean the way that this is interpret this history is interpreted by feminist
4779720	4785720	often is is this all those social norms exist to control female sexuality and they did but they
4785720	4791000	also exist to control male sexuality and the purpose of it wasn't to oppress women it wasn't
4791000	4797160	motivated by misogyny it was motivated by the fact that if sex leads to reproduction then that's
4797160	4802280	everyone's concern like that that matters to the community because if you've got people
4803000	4808200	young couples producing illegitimate children like that's that matters to the family that matters
4808200	4815160	to the community it it's it's essential in a world without contraception to control young
4815160	4820520	people's sexuality and that's what those norms existed for and we threw them out the window
4820520	4827400	very rapidly and we've basically seen this play out over the last however many decades and i think
4827480	4831080	that the the results are in and they're not very promising
4834600	4838120	that's really really good i i learned from mary when she came on the show
4838760	4844840	about the fact that a lot of the rules and the norms that are set are by the elite and
4844840	4850520	they're usually not the ones that suffer the impact it's a luxury belief right yeah to hold
4850520	4855400	that um men don't need to hold the door open for you and that having chivalry and constraints on
4855400	4862680	male behavior that's not needed by some upper middle class woman whose husband has got a
4862680	4869240	postgraduate degree because there are maybe levels of education or or norm enforcement
4869240	4873240	that have occurred just through his upbringing and her upbringing that means that it doesn't matter
4873240	4879400	what you don't think about is the the underclass or the working class guy and girl who perhaps
4879400	4884920	haven't had those same sort of levels of norms enforced and maybe they don't know that not
4885000	4889240	hitting your wife is that big of a deal and then when the culture starts to erode and evaporate
4889240	4896200	that away you go well but the people that made the rules or that encourage the norms to be dissolved
4896200	4901080	and not the ones that are suffering they're dissolving yeah rob henson actually i think
4901080	4906120	uses polyamory as his one of his examples as he and his his original luxury beliefs i say
4906680	4913960	where if you're a high status person let's say in like the bay area where everyone else polyamory
4914760	4920840	is really is just like cool and you can if it all falls in a heap it doesn't matter because you've
4920840	4925960	got your money and your status and all of your stability to fall back on and everyone will just
4925960	4931320	sort of think that you're a bit behemian whereas if you're a working class underclass woman who's
4931320	4936360	basically you know living polyamory like having lots of different partners and lots of different
4936360	4942760	children by them people one will think you're trash but two like your life becomes so challenging
4942760	4947720	because you've got you've got all these children to look after and you don't have the reliable
4947720	4954760	support of a partner and like you're at risk of absolutely everything falling apart but but this
4954760	4959960	is but yeah it is a luxury belief in the sense that saying that that's a good thing and and and
4959960	4969880	resisting the um resisting the traditional norms that used to that used to exist gives status to
4969880	4977160	rich people well think about i i i really like the idea that um beating the other side was more
4977160	4982040	important than raising up the people of your political party and i think that that's very true
4982040	4989720	there was a study that i saw around about 2012 surveys of democrats and republicans the um
4989720	4995800	proportions twisted and they they flipped from i vote for my party because i like my party to
4995800	5001160	i vote for my party because i dislike the other party pretty much more people were doing protest
5001160	5007320	votes because of a hatred of the other rather than a love of the similar yeah you go well
5008440	5012760	how easily is that to be weaponized you know and how how many perverse incentives are you
5012760	5018680	going to create there you mentioned at the beginning about um how my book will be received in america
5018680	5026360	and um not all but a lot of the a lot of my friends who are also writing on similar things
5026360	5034040	like mary and nina and so on are british and british feminism is much more it's much more
5034040	5039800	permissible to say this stuff than it is in the states in general and i think the reason for that
5039800	5046280	is that we don't really have a christian right in the uk so there isn't really any like fearsome
5046280	5051480	enemy that we all need to be focused against and things like abortion rights are rock solid pretty
5051480	5058440	much like not in ireland but in the mainland uk um like that doesn't feel under threat and
5059240	5064360	i think that's what it is that because i think american feminism is just so focused all the time
5065000	5069320	on like often shadow boxing against the christian right in the sense that i think they overstate
5069320	5073000	their influence in their power and there's and they're kind of stuck in the past a little bit
5073000	5079240	and there's this like underdog mentality that we things like constantly having to reassert like oh
5079240	5083960	you shouldn't be ashamed of sex you should be you know it's like we've won that fight come on
5083960	5089800	i think it's like look at any any newspaper magazine tv channel whatever like the idea
5089800	5095000	that women are not allowed to say they enjoy sex it's like 50 years out of date come on so they're
5095000	5103160	so focused on a like somewhat imaginary enemy that they can't actually interrogate the coherence
5103160	5108920	of their own views whereas they think in the uk that isn't that isn't so much the case at all
5108920	5115800	and actually there's a lot more things like trans politics or whatever which we haven't
5115800	5121960	gone into in in this discussion but is is much more cross-party is not there isn't this like
5122920	5129000	really fierce dichotomy politically which i think gives more space for thinking critically
5129000	5134920	like i i feel like i can write this book and i'm not going to get pegged as a crazy conservative
5135800	5141160	i might be wrong about that we'll wait and see how should people act then given all of this
5141160	5147400	everything that we've gone through how should people act so i mean i i i do basically make the
5147400	5153800	case in the book for for for being a bit more old-fashioned on some stuff like i a lot of a
5153800	5159320	lot of that section of it is directed more at women than at men so like i think for instance
5159320	5163720	it's a good idea for women not to have sex on the first date or not even to have sex in the first
5163720	5169240	three months because that that gives you the opportunity to assess whether or not he considers
5169240	5176920	you to be good time only or if your wife material stuff like that which like you could basically
5177000	5185160	read in most agony answer from like the 1950s which is obviously what i get accused of in my
5185160	5190040	reviews um but also they like there was there was a reason for it it wasn't it wasn't motivated by
5190040	5196040	misogyny you know there was a there was like a proper principle behind it um i mean similarly for
5196040	5199880	men i i mean i don't know what i don't know what advice i have to offer fit in the cells to be honest
5201320	5204680	i think i'm probably not the right person to offer any kind of advice because
5204680	5211480	typically they don't like advice in any case no from like a fish teaching a fisherman how to fish
5211480	5217560	type thing yeah it just it goes down badly i had a nama kates on um a couple of months maybe six
5217560	5221400	months ago and she's done tons of work tons of research like first hand research into it
5222440	5226120	a lot of people were unhappy about the fact that she wasn't someone that could understand their
5226120	5231400	plight um so okay so for women don't have sex on the first date not having sex for three months
5231480	5236280	so there's an interesting uh insight i learned from jeffrey miller evolutionary psychologist so
5236280	5240040	his book mate that he wrote with tucker max which should have been so much bigger than it was
5240040	5244360	it's such a shame that it didn't do like mental numbers because it's great he explained about
5244360	5250920	how um slut shaming is a sort of game theoretic enforcement mechanism to ensure that the price
5250920	5256040	of sex doesn't descend lower than women want it to which is why most women are the enforcers of
5256040	5261160	slut shaming not men men actually have an incentive for slut shaming to go away um yeah
5261240	5269800	but one of the problems that you have here is you can kind of see ease of sex or or or speed
5269800	5276760	towards um being accepting of having sex with a potential new partner as kind of being a price
5276760	5280920	right and as you start to extend that out the price that the man has to pay continues to go up
5280920	5286040	and up and up so you really do need a bit of a god's eye view because if every woman tomorrow said
5286040	5290440	right no sex until three months that's fine that's the playing field maybe you would have more men
5290440	5294040	that would sort of duck out of the dating game but over time they would acclimatize right because
5294040	5300600	we acclimatize to no sex before marriage that was there so yeah i think okay so what else what
5300600	5307400	else can people do i mean yeah so on that point about um yeah i mean strike breakers
5308200	5314840	really for everyone else the i think that one of the things i hope comes from the book is that
5315240	5320040	a lot of young women in particular because they've not yet learned through life experience are
5320040	5324680	phenomenally ignorant about the reality of male sexuality and the reality of sexual difference
5325480	5330840	and so don't realize for instance some of what we've spoken about the fact that like um the sexual
5330840	5337640	double standard is alive and well and um a lot of like men can have a motion of sex in a way that
5338200	5343080	women can't and all of this and so we'll interpret for instance um
5344600	5349400	though they will misinterpret a lot of male behavior and end up making decisions that
5349400	5352920	actually not in their best interest because they they think that you know the guy who wants to sleep
5352920	5359080	with them must want something more from them afterwards and then and then i like you know
5359080	5365720	learn the hard way that that's not true and i think that actually if if there was more
5366520	5373080	knowledge widespread knowledge about the existence of these facts i think actually that
5373080	5377480	young women's behavior could change quite quickly because at the moment for instance the
5378840	5383560	like you go on tiktok or whatever and you get young women will do things like show off their
5383560	5387800	bruises that they've got from having rough sex with men who like obviously hate them
5388440	5392360	but they're a it's a status symbol because it's a sign of being oh look i'm so attractive i mean
5392360	5398360	particularly things like choking a lot of women interpret choking as being a sign of like passionate
5398360	5403720	love like in like a 50 shades of gray way like i want you so much i'll do anything to have you
5403720	5408760	is the way that this is like interpreted in the romantic imagination that's not generally have
5408760	5414200	the men who are doing it interpret it at all so there's this like mutual miscomprehension
5414200	5418840	where each sex is doing something they actually don't like realize how the other side is interpreting
5418840	5423480	it i think if more women realized that it would it would no longer be high status to be showing
5423480	5428440	off your bruises on tiktok because actually the like the truth of it is that basically any
5428440	5433800	moderately good-looking young women can get as many partners as she wants and can get them to do
5435240	5442280	you know if she if if she asks them to choke her they will it's not a sign of being super attractive
5443080	5448360	but it's misinterpreted as being as such so i think that if there were more
5450120	5453400	i think there was a better understanding than some of the incentives would change
5454840	5456520	which would be a good thing for young women
5457480	5464760	louise perry ladies and gentlemen i really really enjoyed the book i think that the group of women
5464760	5470040	that we've got in the uk you mary nina we need to come up with a new net this can be a public
5470040	5475480	service announcement to the people that are still listening um before we started we came up with the
5475480	5482120	name of based british women but then realized that the acronym of bbw can be problematic
5483000	5488120	so if you've got an alternative that the girls can use that would be great um but yeah i i think
5488120	5492360	that it's really great i'd i really really like all of the work that you guys have put out um
5492360	5495000	where should people go they want to read more of your stuff online where should they go
5495160	5500280	so there's a book obviously which is out already in the uk the case against sexual
5500280	5507480	revolution um and it's out at the end of august in america and i write a weekly column for the
5507480	5513640	new statesman you got a sub stack as well right no i don't actually i i start it one very briefly
