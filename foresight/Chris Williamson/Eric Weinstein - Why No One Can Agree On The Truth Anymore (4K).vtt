00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
You just came back from your first holiday in quite a while.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
Well, my first holiday of, let's say, three weeks or more in quite a while.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
How was that?

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
Astounding.

00:13.000 --> 00:21.000
Really very good to see what's going on in the rest of the world at this particular moment.

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
We had previously gone to India in the year to visit family.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.000
This was to go back to Turkey and to go to Portugal, but also to the Azores Islands.

00:32.000 --> 00:39.000
I can't tell you how meaningful it was for me to be back traveling.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
Why?

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
Well, I mean, partially it's reacquaint.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
When you have children and children change your game for about two decades,

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
you have to realize that that's a transient period.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
It felt like it was going to go on forever.

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
This was sort of trying to figure out what is it like to go from traveling in your 20s and 30s with that kids

00:59.000 --> 01:05.000
to traveling with your kids at the last moment that you still have them at home.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
Now you're going to have the rest of your life without them again,

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
but you can't go back to backpacking and doing certain other things that were easy for you.

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
You have to figure out how to rejoin your previous life that has been in progress without you actually.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Ending for a long time.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Exactly.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
That's sabbatical from life almost.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
Another thing is that you forget about parts of yourself.

01:24.000 --> 01:34.000
I forgot that I spoke Turkish not well, but I spoke rudimentary Tarzan Turkish 30 years ago.

01:34.000 --> 01:41.000
To be back in Istanbul and suddenly have words and phrases and things come back

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
and be talking to cab drivers and just people in the street seeing the change.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
Obviously, there's been an enormous amount of change in Turkey.

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
Portugal is fascinating seeing certain things at the end of their life cycle.

01:55.000 --> 02:00.000
We were at a synagogue in Bursa where the home of the Ottoman Empire,

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
where they were down to their last 50 people, which is a common enough thing

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
when we visit diaspora Jewish communities at the tail end with the embers still glowing hot

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
but no chance for a rebirth.

02:14.000 --> 02:23.000
Then in the Azores, I was not prepared for the level of beauty that we encountered.

02:23.000 --> 02:29.000
There is a level of beauty that I've only experienced two, maybe three times in my life

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
that sort of leaves you physically sick, like ill.

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
It's so beautiful that your body is the weak link.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
You might think that sugar is tasty, but if you were to eat a bag of sugar,

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
you'd probably be sick to your stomach.

02:44.000 --> 02:51.000
I would say this was so much beauty that it was at an almost pathological level

02:51.000 --> 02:56.000
and more than I think my family could really take in.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
We're just so moving.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
I've heard you say before about how a lot of the time you don't realize

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
the last time you're going to do a thing with a person.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
A lot of friends, especially ones that are fathers, have told me the same thing.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
The last time that you'll bounce your daughter on your knee.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
You don't know when it's going to happen, but it's going to happen.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
There's also a really strange realization when you get deeper into adulthood

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
and work out that probably by the age of 18 or 20,

03:19.000 --> 03:24.000
you've spent 97 or 98% of the time you're going to spend with your parents.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
All that you wanted for the last four years was to be away from them

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
and now all that you want is to have a little bit more time and it's all gone

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
and you squandered it while it was there.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
I'm on the ethnic program.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
We don't believe in this stuff.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
My children don't become adults at the age of 18.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
I don't care about the laws of the United States or the state of California.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
I think we do family wrong in the States.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
You send them off to college and then you tell them,

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
go follow your dream and they bounce into some locality that you aren't in

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
and you don't get the benefit of these very strong families

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
because the market has been so strong in the US for so long.

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
And the market more or less took over all sorts of duties

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
that were assigned to families historically.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
And so the reason that people always say,

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
oh, your families are weak was because our markets were strong, right?

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
And so insurance and opportunity,

04:18.000 --> 04:24.000
all of these things that could be handed over to the market were.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
And as a result, when we find out that the markets are not safe,

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
we realize that we've abandoned the structures that we needed to retreat to

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
that our families are quite small, below replacement rate very often.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
And we don't live in the same place.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
And so, you know, I married a woman from India

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
and I basically carry a lot of Eastern European norms.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
And so my feeling is that my children are my children forever.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
And I'm not letting go of them.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
And this idea that it's your life and you can do what you want

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
is only true up to a point.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
You also have a continuity issue.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
And this is normal, by the way.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
And it may sound weird in an American context,

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
but I think that the world recognizes that we're links in a chain

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
and there's a certain amount that you get to do that's just yours

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
because it's your life, but never go full Billy Joel.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Yeah.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
Pan-generational housing is something being in Austin,

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
people getting ranches, starting even commune,

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
you know, 10 family mini villages with a bunch of other people.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Yeah.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
It's something that I'm seeing occur more and more.

05:27.000 --> 05:32.000
And, you know, in an atomized, like mass solipsism,

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
mass individualism society, this doesn't sound like a bad redress.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
We got to the end of it.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
We got to the end of that dream.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
And it didn't work.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
You've been around a lot of very powerful, very rich people

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
throughout your career.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
No, no, that's not true.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
Only relatively recently, only in the last decade and a half.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
That's quite a while in many people's lives.

05:52.000 --> 06:00.000
What do you think that most normal people would be surprised to know

06:00.000 --> 06:06.000
about the powerful and the rich individuals, world views,

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
the way that they hold themselves, what is and isn't true?

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
They feel powerless.

06:13.000 --> 06:19.000
That's one of the craziest things is that very often you're at a table

06:19.000 --> 06:25.000
of people of immeasurable wealth and they're talking about the rich

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
or the hyper-connected.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
They don't see themselves in these terms.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Why?

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
I think there's different kinds of rich, to be honest.

06:34.000 --> 06:42.000
I think that if, for example, you got rich from, let's say, arms manufacturing,

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
you've been entwined with government your whole life or agriculture,

06:46.000 --> 06:53.000
something that's highly regulated that extraction oil and gas.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
Those people, I think, have always been close to power.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
A lot of the dream of tech, for example, was we don't need the government.

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
We'll just build stuff in our garages and if it's cool, it'll take care of itself.

07:06.000 --> 07:11.000
And therefore, we're minimally dependent on the traditional ecosystems.

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
So a lot of tech money felt disenfranchised.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
They didn't know how to play the game.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
That was both to its credit and a huge danger.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
But I think one of the things that I find very interesting is that when people are

07:27.000 --> 07:34.000
not rate-limited by money, they're rate-limited by all sorts of other things.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
They may not want their number to go down.

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
So they go from 6 billion to 4 billion would be a huge blow,

07:42.000 --> 07:47.000
even though it doesn't seem to impact normal things.

07:47.000 --> 07:52.000
Another thing is that most of them have given up on the retail notion of reality.

07:52.000 --> 07:58.000
Whatever mainstream media, if you have a worldview that allows you to listen

07:58.000 --> 08:04.000
to national public radio that then reads the Wall Street Journal

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
and The Times and The New Yorker, whatever that point of view is,

08:08.000 --> 08:16.000
most of the very powerful rich people I know have checked out at a level that is astounding.

08:16.000 --> 08:22.000
They don't believe that they can afford to depend on normal institutions.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
How does that show up in their lives?

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Weird ways.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
They don't have a regular doctor.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
They have concierge medicine.

08:30.000 --> 08:35.000
Their fire policy comes with a private fire department that will fight for their home

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
but won't necessarily fight for homes next door unless it's just-

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
I didn't know that that was a thing, okay?

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
You know, it's not until you travel with some of these people

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
that you realize that there's a secret corridor in the airport

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
or a way of getting onto the plane.

08:52.000 --> 08:57.000
There's a lot of infrastructure built for a very small number of people.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
For the most part, they can't figure out what to do with the money.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
It's my belief.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
If you believe that the world is headed towards an apocalypse,

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
you're very unlikely to want to contribute money

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
because that's the only fungible thing you have in an emergency.

09:17.000 --> 09:22.000
I think that a lot of the sort of apocalyptic thinking of very powerful people

09:22.000 --> 09:27.000
is very destructive because they're trying to figure out

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
how to survive a mild apocalypse,

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
like a six months of your-

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
You know, if I have six months of canned goods

09:35.000 --> 09:43.000
and I've got four X Navy SEALs on my property in a remote location in Montana,

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
can I weather the storm with a few diesel generators?

09:46.000 --> 09:51.000
So if it's a very mild apocalypse, maybe they've got six months' plan.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
But I think that there's a lot of thinking

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
that you should husband your resources because you don't know what's coming

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
given that things are going to have to collapse.

10:01.000 --> 10:06.000
And I think it's very sad because those are the people who could shore up the system.

10:07.000 --> 10:12.000
It's interesting to think about helplessness at the top end of the wealth distribution

10:12.000 --> 10:17.000
given that a lot of people feel like they are restricted by their material possessions.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
But it seems like despite there being a lot of abundance,

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
at least monetarily, the scarcity mentality scales all the way up.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
It really does.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
And particularly if you've been deprived early in your life,

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
there's something that happens where you're nervous till your dying day

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
that you're going to die under an overpass, right?

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
I'm not kidding.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
One thing that I highly recommend, people never take me seriously,

10:40.000 --> 10:45.000
is a video game called a tower defense game of plants versus zombies.

10:45.000 --> 10:50.000
And plants versus zombies ends in a situation where you win

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
all the things you can inside of the game,

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
but somehow you still have the ability to continue to earn

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
even though there's nothing left to purchase.

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
And the reason that I find this fascinating is you get to watch your own psychology,

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
which is now that you've given yourself the ability to earn,

11:07.000 --> 11:12.000
you can't bring yourself to stop earning even though earning has lost meaning.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
And so if you can't get to that in real life,

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
you can at least get to that inside of plants versus zombies.

11:18.000 --> 11:23.000
And I highly recommend it because you have to give yourself some idea of

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
we have to cross finish lines as they come.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
If you decide, okay, when I get to $10 million,

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
that's when I can afford to become a philanthropist.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Then you're going to get there and you're going to realize,

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
no, the goals are going to move.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
So think about how a waitress sees this.

11:38.000 --> 11:43.000
Waitresses do philanthropy almost from the beginning.

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
They'll overtip somebody who gives them good service and they can't afford it.

11:47.000 --> 11:52.000
And it's sort of a poverty trap when you're at the very low end of the earning spectrum.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
But I think there's something to take from that,

11:55.000 --> 12:00.000
which is practice a little bit of philanthropy and a little bit of kicking your shoes up

12:00.000 --> 12:07.000
and not always deferring taking profit in some sense on your success.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
So make sure that all throughout your life,

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
you're treating yourself to some luxury even when you can least afford it

12:15.000 --> 12:19.000
and you're just exhibiting a little bit of goodness

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
even though you feel like you desperately need to build yourself up

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
because otherwise you'll always push it out.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
There's a Morgan Housell quote where he says,

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
the best way to win the game is to stop moving the goalposts.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
And he's wrote this great book called The Psychology of Money.

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
And it's true that most people treat their goals.

12:38.000 --> 12:43.000
Their relationship to their goals is like the horizon that for every step toward it they get,

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
it then moves one step further away.

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
It's probably more like the horizon on a spring or on a rubber band.

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
Then it gets a little bit closer and then it bonk, it snaps away from you.

12:53.000 --> 12:59.000
And I've been around a lot of people that have got chunks of wealth

13:00.000 --> 13:07.000
and it's a rare thing to see someone who doesn't still have that scarcity mentality

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
despite the fact that they've acquired it.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
You need to keep the scarcity mentality.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
It's not a mistake.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
The problem is that you also need an abundance mentality

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
and then you need to selectively access them in different circumstance.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Talk to me about the tension between those two.

13:21.000 --> 13:26.000
Well, it's just this regulated expression idea that we keep trying to find settings where we don't,

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
just let me set the air conditioner at 68 and then I'll be happy forever.

13:31.000 --> 13:36.000
In reality, more or less you need contradictory facilities

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
and you need to know when to pull one in and let the other out.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
And this is the heart thing.

13:42.000 --> 13:47.000
Anybody with multiple children knows that with one kid you're saying,

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
you cannot afford to take these risks.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
If you jump off something like that and you don't look below, think what you could do.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
The other kid needs this.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Come on.

13:59.000 --> 14:05.000
I've heard your brother say that him and his wife's advice to the children was

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
as long as you don't do anything to your eyes,

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
you can take the risks that you want.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Yes and no.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
I mean, there's teeth, there's throats.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
Anything somebody who does combat sports knows has to be regularly.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
He's going to try and attack.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Small joints, whatever it is.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
There are plenty of ways to get yourself into real trouble.

14:22.000 --> 14:27.000
The key thing that you're trying to use childhoods for is to go through the mistakes

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
that are not permanently disfiguring.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
It's one of the importance of having fathers around.

14:34.000 --> 14:39.000
The importance of rough and tumble play is facilitated almost exclusively by fathers.

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
And you learn the limits of your strength.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
You learn the limits of your body.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
You learn how high of a tree you can jump off

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
and how high of a tree you can't jump off.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
You also learn to lose.

14:51.000 --> 14:57.000
I mean, I really hate some of this winter talk where basically people have no plan to lose.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
And then when they actually experience loss,

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
they tend to throw everything away to say,

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
I didn't lose, you know, that's very interesting.

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000

16:04.000 --> 16:09.000
You met Jeffrey Epstein once.

16:10.000 --> 16:17.000
Talk to me about what that's like coming face to face with somebody of that caliber.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
Whatever that means.

16:20.000 --> 16:27.000
Well, one thing is that there is a physiological reaction that corresponds to this phrase that,

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
you know, the hair on the back of my neck stood on end.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
Like that's a real physiological feeling.

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
I don't know whether the hair actually does that, but it's exactly what it feels like.

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
You're meeting somebody who is unholy.

16:42.000 --> 16:49.000
And, you know, one of the most interesting things is that he was beckoning into a world

16:49.000 --> 16:56.000
that didn't seem to exist, but for him as the doormat.

16:56.000 --> 17:03.000
I think that's one of the things that freaked out a lot of these rich people is that he felt rich in a movie

17:03.000 --> 17:10.000
sense, which is not something that you find among actually rich people.

17:10.000 --> 17:15.000
What do you mean?

17:15.000 --> 17:22.000
Well, a lot of very wealthy people don't own an island.

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
Islands are really tough to maintain.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
I'm obsessed with islands.

17:28.000 --> 17:33.000
And, you know, in general, I have to be obsessed with islands that have airports run by other people

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
because, you know, they have populations on them.

17:36.000 --> 17:43.000
But every rich person starts to wonder, can I afford an island or how many jets?

17:43.000 --> 17:49.000
And if you look at Jeffrey Epstein's wealth, it was beaten, it was like gold beaten into gold foil

17:49.000 --> 17:54.000
so that it could cover a vast area and leave the impression of a solid gold life.

17:54.000 --> 18:01.000
But it was really probably a mid nine figure fortune that had been used to buy islands and planes,

18:01.000 --> 18:06.000
which is not what any nine figure person is going to do.

18:06.000 --> 18:13.000
So you had a felt sense and embodied sense of discomfort?

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Oh, hell yeah.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
And where did that come from?

18:19.000 --> 18:26.000
The fact that he had a lipstick camera pointed at me from an art object that he laid a table

18:26.000 --> 18:31.000
that was preposterously long and thin with a tablecloth made of an American flag

18:31.000 --> 18:36.000
to make it look like a coffin so that I would spill my coffee on the flag of my own country.

18:36.000 --> 18:43.000
I mean, the fact that he looked like a mutant Ralph Lauren with this kind of labricious quality

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
and he's talking all of the science and market stuff and nothing adds up

18:47.000 --> 18:52.000
and there's an heiress bouncing on his knee to get his boobs to jiggle to see whether it can distract.

18:52.000 --> 18:59.000
I mean, it's like one of these crazy scenes where nothing about it was normal.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
There was no trace of a normal world.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
That sounds like a script from a movie.

19:05.000 --> 19:10.000
Yeah, I mean, I think part of it, John Travolta is like putting a gun to your head

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
and forcing you to drink and break a code in a minute.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
Yeah, like that part of it.

19:15.000 --> 19:21.000
And then there was some sort of like, you know, remember that story,

19:21.000 --> 19:26.000
the most dangerous game where a man invites you to his island so he can hunt you.

19:26.000 --> 19:33.000
You know, this was scary and it was meant to be scary.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Sounds menacing.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Well, I think his product was silence.

19:36.000 --> 19:41.000
People think that his product was sex or finance, but it was silence.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
I'm pretty sure.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
What's that mean?

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
If you're scary enough, look, rich people can get sex,

19:47.000 --> 19:54.000
but they can't necessarily get people to shut up afterwards.

19:54.000 --> 20:01.000
So my take on it and my take on it instantly was this is not an actual human.

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
This is a construct of someone's.

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
Someone has created a fake human being called Jeffrey Epstein,

20:09.000 --> 20:14.000
who's a mysterious currency trading financier with crazy rules

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
so that no one would ever invest with him.

20:17.000 --> 20:23.000
And I think that was to keep people from seeking his investment services.

20:23.000 --> 20:28.000
I mean, you know, he's labeled disgraced financier,

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
but nobody has a record of trading with him.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
He was sitting there.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
He comes into the meeting and he says, you know,

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
well, Eric, I was just doing some currency trading.

20:37.000 --> 20:43.000
And I thought about that scene that you sometimes see in as a meme

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
with Steve Buscemi with a skateboard over his shoulder.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Hello, fellow financier.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Hello, fellow financial traders.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
Exactly.

20:51.000 --> 20:59.000
So I'm thinking you don't really look like a rich guy who trades in markets.

20:59.000 --> 21:05.000
The thing that's interesting that I'm finding myself intrigued by here is

21:05.000 --> 21:09.000
it takes a moderate amount of cognitive horsepower

21:09.000 --> 21:18.000
to be able to piece together this theater that you sat down at.

21:18.000 --> 21:24.000
Deployed in a nefarious, malicious, manipulative way.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
But it's smart.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
What do you mean it's smart?

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
Say more.

21:29.000 --> 21:34.000
It's not something that could be done by a simple mind.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
You think he did it?

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Oh, he has a team of manipulators?

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
No, when I say I think he was a construct, I literally mean that.

21:42.000 --> 21:47.000
I think he was constructed, like fitted with a story.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Oh, so you think he was a plant?

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
No, I think he was a construct.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
What's that?

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
Okay, you're going to have to dig in.

21:53.000 --> 22:05.000
I think Jeffrey Epstein, a super genius financier, was not a thing that existed.

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
Where did the money come from?

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
You're going to mumble, okay, so that's what you mumble.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
But then there's this missing fortune of Robert Maxwell

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
and this fortune of Jeffrey Epstein that we can't explain.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Are those the same fortune?

22:22.000 --> 22:27.000
The conservation of money principle, that if you have a fortune that's missing

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
and you have a fortune that can't be explained in there connected by Guillain Maxwell?

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
I don't know.

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
Why is it that no hedge funds, what is it?

22:38.000 --> 22:42.000
They file form, I forget it, it's 13F.

22:42.000 --> 22:46.000
There's certain forms that you have to file.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Nobody's ever asked for these things.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
Who's his prime broker?

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
Has somebody gone over the prime brokerage?

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
What are his trades?

22:54.000 --> 22:59.000
He would have to move the market if he was doing a yard of euros or Swiss francs

22:59.000 --> 23:04.000
or who knows what, like a billion, that would move the market.

23:04.000 --> 23:12.000
So there's no way you can fake retroactively a hedge fund of immeasurable size that trades currencies.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
I don't think he was a currency trader.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
He told me he was a currency trader.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
So when you say a construct, who constructs?

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
Who's the builder?

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
I don't know.

23:21.000 --> 23:26.000
I would imagine some version of the intelligence community.

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
You know, sometimes somebody's cover gets blown.

23:30.000 --> 23:36.000
We have a very famous unfortunate story of Ellie Cohn with the Mossad,

23:36.000 --> 23:44.000
where Ellie Cohn was an Egyptian Jew who was fitted with a backstory that he was an Argentinian playboy

23:44.000 --> 23:49.000
who'd made a fortune in Argentina, but was Arabic in origin,

23:49.000 --> 23:54.000
and then he moves to Damascus and he takes out an apartment where he holds orgies

23:54.000 --> 24:00.000
and becomes the best friend of Hafiz al-Assad, right?

24:00.000 --> 24:05.000
And so that's an example of a story we know.

24:05.000 --> 24:11.000
We know how the intelligence communities of the world create people who don't really exist.

24:12.000 --> 24:18.000
I know that this is just a one-time thing here that you got to see,

24:18.000 --> 24:25.000
but the construction of the coffin-looking American flag, the spilling of the coffee,

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
this weird power play thing that's going on,

24:28.000 --> 24:37.000
that seems, now that you say that it wasn't him even pulling his own strings, perhaps,

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
it makes a lot more sense, but even that,

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
that degree of sophistication, I learned this from Daniel Schmacktenberger.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
We sat down and he's spent some time with particularly powerful people,

24:46.000 --> 24:54.000
and he told me this really harrowing story of somebody who has both the desire and the means

24:54.000 --> 24:59.000
to treat themselves like an apex predator against their own kind,

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
and they said so.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
They broke the fourth wall about this and said,

25:04.000 --> 25:09.000
apex predators don't care about the prey, but they saw their own kind as prey.

25:09.000 --> 25:15.000
I asked Daniel, how does it feel to sit opposite somebody who isn't rate limited by the resources,

25:15.000 --> 25:19.000
who can not only dream to have this,

25:19.000 --> 25:26.000
plus have the motivation or lack of virtue or integrity to go ahead and consider doing it,

25:26.000 --> 25:30.000
and then has the capacity, the assets to be able to enact it.

25:30.000 --> 25:35.000
It's reminding me, it's giving me this same something.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
It feels like it's up on the top of my head.

25:38.000 --> 25:42.000
It's giving me some sort of a sense like that.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
This was intended to be terrifying.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
It wasn't an accident.

25:46.000 --> 25:51.000
It was intended to be as fascinating as it could possibly be, which it was,

25:51.000 --> 25:58.000
and terrifying at the same time, and it achieved both objectives.

25:58.000 --> 26:02.000
I mean, I was given an opportunity to meet him again.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
I didn't know what to do.

26:05.000 --> 26:10.000
I mean, the other thing that I just found really weird is that he knew about my research,

26:10.000 --> 26:15.000
and it turned out that he was connected to my graduate department at Harvard.

26:15.000 --> 26:20.000
So he had a connection to the Harvard Math Department unbeknownst to me.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
I don't know when that began.

26:23.000 --> 26:28.000
I know two of the professors he was connected through.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
This is some unholy story.

26:31.000 --> 26:35.000
It has nothing to do with Jeffrey Epstein.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
It has to do with whatever this thing was.

26:37.000 --> 26:42.000
We tripped over a thing.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
We tripped over a structure.

26:45.000 --> 26:51.000
We named the structure Jeffrey Epstein.

26:51.000 --> 26:59.000
It must be very unfortunate in some regards for whoever it was, if that's true,

26:59.000 --> 27:05.000
that was in charge of this construction, that it became that people got t-shirts

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
with his name printed on them.

27:07.000 --> 27:13.000
This was already going wrong in the early 2000s.

27:13.000 --> 27:19.000
You see, my sense of this is that this was a pre-internet plan

27:19.000 --> 27:27.000
that lived into the internet age and couldn't survive contact with the internet age.

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
What did the internet bring in that didn't allow it to survive?

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Eyeballs, discussion.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
Level of surveillance.

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
There's a claim that nobody cares about Jeffrey Epstein

27:36.000 --> 27:40.000
because it's this many years later and we've all moved on.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
That's completely untrue.

27:42.000 --> 27:46.000
We know that it's true because if you start talking about Jeffrey Epstein,

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
the engagement goes up.

27:49.000 --> 27:55.000
You have these fictions that are put out by mainstream media

27:55.000 --> 28:00.000
or traditional news desks, which is nobody cares about that story.

28:00.000 --> 28:04.000
You can see from social media that that's not true from the internet.

28:04.000 --> 28:09.000
The internet is constantly providing an ability to check

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
whether or not these claims from inside the structure are true.

28:12.000 --> 28:16.000
Jeffrey Epstein is an example of what I called an anti-interesting phenomenon.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
What's that?

28:21.000 --> 28:26.000
Well, an anti-interesting thing is something that would normally be fascinating.

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
Imagine, for example, you had a story where you could get a Pulitzer Prize for breaking it.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
Everybody cares.

28:31.000 --> 28:37.000
You'd sell papers like hotcakes, blah, blah, blah, and nobody wants to report on it.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
And it's like right there.

28:39.000 --> 28:43.000
You could just ask the dumbest questions and it would, like,

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
New York Times says, disgraced financier.

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
Well, tell me, did you find his prime broker?

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
Did you find the forms?

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
Did you go to his offices in Valard House?

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
No, nobody does, ever.

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
The story is anti-interesting and it's very different than being uninteresting.

29:02.000 --> 29:06.000
Which would suggest more collusion, more coordination?

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
Hello?

29:09.000 --> 29:14.000
I mean, see, this is one of the most uncomfortable things.

29:14.000 --> 29:19.000
I think there was a time when mostly when people said collusion or coordination,

29:19.000 --> 29:23.000
their presumption was, well, that's kind of, that's pretty far out there.

29:23.000 --> 29:29.000
We now know, like post Elon Musk's $44 billion adventure at Twitter,

29:29.000 --> 29:35.000
that there are these coordinating groups, coordinating social media with the intelligence

29:35.000 --> 29:40.000
community or with the Department of Homeland Security or with the State Department.

29:40.000 --> 29:46.000
We now know that we're living in an orchestrated, curated, choreographed world.

29:46.000 --> 29:52.000
And we can't know it officially, but we all know it if we want it out.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Which is hysterical.

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
Now we have to talk about, well, are you a conspiracy theorist?

29:57.000 --> 30:03.000
Like, I read, I read the Slack messages, I read the emails.

30:03.000 --> 30:06.000
What are you even talking about now?

30:08.000 --> 30:15.000
Sanbankman Freed currently being recharged with witness tampering as well.

30:15.000 --> 30:22.000
That to me, fresh charges, releasing, even though he's totally couldn't get in touch with the press,

30:22.000 --> 30:27.000
I think hundreds of phone calls to the press, leaked his ex-girlfriend, allegedly,

30:28.000 --> 30:33.000
leaked his ex-girlfriend's diary entries, so on and so forth.

30:33.000 --> 30:41.000
And, you know, this is a guy that some of my friends were flown to go and see on his island, his portion of an island.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
Yeah, his portion, it's very different.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
Yeah, okay.

30:44.000 --> 30:48.000
For very different reasons as well.

30:48.000 --> 30:53.000
There seems to be, and you hear about it, they believe they're above the law.

30:53.000 --> 30:57.000
There was this really cool documentary on Netflix called The Murder Dark Murders,

30:57.000 --> 31:02.000
and it was this small town, big family, lots of money, and the kids ran rampant, right?

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
Classic like Silver Spoon aristocracy bullshit.

31:05.000 --> 31:18.000
But when it gets scaled up this much more, Sanbankman Freed, the biggest alleged financial crime since Bernie Madoff,

31:19.000 --> 31:24.000
allegedly tampering with witnesses, allegedly leaking his ex-girlfriend's diary entries.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
And?

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
Did the rules not apply to everybody?

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
Certainly they don't.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
Why?

31:37.000 --> 31:41.000
We stopped prosecuting all sorts of types of people.

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
You know, look, we stopped holding hearings.

31:45.000 --> 31:52.000
I grew up in a world where we had the church committee, the pike committee looking at our own intelligence services.

31:52.000 --> 32:00.000
We had Watergate hearings, we had tobacco hearings, we had Iran-Contra hearings.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
Do you know how many hearings we need right now?

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
Where are these things?

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
It's ridiculous.

32:07.000 --> 32:12.000
We've got weird stuff about UFOs with people making the craziest allegations.

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
Look, this is just not normal.

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
We're in totally weird uncharted territory.

32:23.000 --> 32:29.000
What do you make of the recent UAPs, I think, is the new term?

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
Eric, you need to get up with the times here.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
They're not UFOs anymore.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
That's the old.

32:34.000 --> 32:37.000
I wasn't even in this game when it was UFOs.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
Okay, okay.

32:38.000 --> 32:43.000
So what do you make of the recent UAP stories and attention and response and subsequent response?

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
I'd like to ask you first.

32:49.000 --> 32:57.000
So I had a look at the first whistleblower from about two months ago quite closely with Andy Stumpf,

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
who used to have pretty high-level security clearance.

33:00.000 --> 33:05.000
And he explained to me about how unimpressive that particular type of security clearance is, how very common.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
Which one?

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
This is David.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
Yes, David.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
No, not David Fraver.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
No, no, no.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
David Fraver was the tic-tac.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
Correct.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
This is Dave Gurush.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
Yes.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
Okay.

33:19.000 --> 33:26.000
Very common level of security clearance, that using that as some sort of, oh, this is a legitimate credential.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
It doesn't really wash too much.

33:28.000 --> 33:35.000
That it was second, it was third-hand information mostly, second-hand information kind of.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
I heard from a person who saw or who heard.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
Right.

33:39.000 --> 33:46.000
It just seemed to me to be rather, on the face of it, unimpressive.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
That release.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
I see.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
What did you think?

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
Well, like I've been telling everybody.

33:54.000 --> 33:57.000
These are highly conserved stories.

33:57.000 --> 34:01.000
This is not the only person I've heard this story from.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
I've heard this from multiple people.

34:03.000 --> 34:10.000
There are various versions of this secret world which play out as space opera.

34:12.000 --> 34:18.000
Then MJ-12 became the real government that only, even the president couldn't understand.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
It's like, okay.

34:20.000 --> 34:32.000
So that's the weird part about it until you start realizing how sober many of the people are who believe this and who claim to have had direct contact with it.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
And then you don't know what to do.

34:37.000 --> 34:44.000
I mean, in other words, whatever this is, there is a thing.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
It's not necessarily little green men.

34:47.000 --> 34:59.000
It could be, for example, that they mock up a floating spaceship in a hangar and then they drag people past it and say, whatever you do, do not look to your left or right or you'll be shot.

34:59.000 --> 35:03.000
And then, of course, people look and then like mission accomplished.

35:03.000 --> 35:08.000
Now people will say, oh my God, you have no idea what we, the US has incredible technology.

35:08.000 --> 35:11.000
And then maybe the idea is you've got a cover story.

35:11.000 --> 35:15.000
Maybe you've got your adversary investing in things that don't make any sense.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
I don't know.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
But there's not nothing here.

35:19.000 --> 35:22.000
This is not about mylar balloons and seagulls anymore.

35:26.000 --> 35:39.000
I'm trying to come up with a word for it, but it's like a, it's like recursive false flags in a way where the goal is not to give or hide truth,

35:40.000 --> 35:44.000
but to fire hose with information so much that the truth can no longer be discerned.

35:44.000 --> 35:50.000
It's a haystack of bullshit to make sure that any needle is very difficult to find.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
It is.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
Yes.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
Bullshit haystacking.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
Right.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
Yeah.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
Okay.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
So they haystack the crap out of this thing.

35:58.000 --> 36:06.000
I have no question that there was something that was used to develop US aircraft like the B2 bomber and the SR-71 Blackbird.

36:06.000 --> 36:13.000
So if you see something crazy in the sky, better that you think it's a UFO from outer space than some advanced thing from Lockheed.

36:13.000 --> 36:23.000
I have no question that we use this to deal with things like the Chinese balloon shootdown where we shot down several things in a week and we couldn't recover debris from any of them.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
I mean, come on guys.

36:27.000 --> 36:35.000
You know, maybe the idea is that this is a head fake to our adversaries to develop the wrong things and to use their treasure on things that won't work.

36:36.000 --> 36:46.000
Maybe there's a secret program where some of this stuff is actually real and true and we're not allowed to know it because it would be too mind blowing.

36:46.000 --> 36:55.000
Maybe there's a cult inside of our government that has replaced angels with saucer shaped aircraft.

36:56.000 --> 37:04.000
Whatever this thing is, it's being used for many different purposes.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
There's something here.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
We just don't know what, you know, this is the problem.

37:11.000 --> 37:14.000
The princess can't feel a pee because that would be impossible.

37:14.000 --> 37:19.000
The princess feels a disturbance and you can't say what the disturbance is.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
Maybe it's a golf ball.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
Maybe it's a cantaloupe.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
Maybe it's a banana.

37:24.000 --> 37:27.000
But whatever it is, there's something wrong with the mattress.

37:31.000 --> 37:36.000
Yeah, it seems to me this firehosing, the goal of uncertainty.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
Right.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
How do things muddle out?

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
Who wins in a muddle is a great question.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
We're not taught to ask.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
Sorry to jump in on that.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
No, tell me more.

37:47.000 --> 37:50.000
Always look for who is trying to muddle to win.

37:51.000 --> 37:56.000
Very often you're in a dispute with entrenched status quo.

37:56.000 --> 38:00.000
And somebody will say, well, I guess we'll have to agree to disagree on this one.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
I'm like, oh, well, who wins if we agree to disagree?

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
Oh, it's you.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
Right?

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
Yeah.

38:07.000 --> 38:12.000
This is like an old principle of mine, which is that you can always tell who's guilty by who first declares a time of healing.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
Why?

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
Why is that a razor to use?

38:16.000 --> 38:28.000
Oh, because if you do something wrong and the public is clamoring for your blood, you say, there's been too much blame and finger pointing on all sides.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
At me.

38:31.000 --> 38:35.000
I think what we need is to come together and declare a time of healing.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
For me.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
Right.

38:37.000 --> 38:42.000
So I believe that in general, whoever declares a time of healing is suspect number one.

38:43.000 --> 38:46.000
That's a very nice razor to use.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
I wonder about this.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
Oh, how would you say?

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
Epidemic of uncertainty.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
Brilliant.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
Speaking my language.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
And I wonder...

39:13.000 --> 39:29.000
How, first off, how as an individual, you are supposed to put up any kind of effective defense to just take some sovereignty being, you know, an agentic individual.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.000
Right.

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
And secondly, I wonder what the end goal is.

39:34.000 --> 39:47.000
I understand why uncertainty would be useful for manipulation, because if people can't discern truth from untruth, it can be easy to poke them and prod them and float them in particular directions.

39:48.000 --> 40:00.000
But it also seems like, I don't know, kind of also useless as well, that some people, non-insignificant, large cohort of people will just reject it entirely.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
Which actually...

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
What are they doing?

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
It actually makes it more chaotic and more unruly.

40:04.000 --> 40:09.000
So it makes me think, well, maybe if this is the case, if the firehosing is happening.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
Right.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
It's epidemic of uncertainty.

40:14.000 --> 40:18.000
Maybe the outcomes were predicted but haven't manifest in the way that was intended.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
Maybe there's more of a rebellious streak in...

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
Say more about that.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
I'm trying to understand it.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
That if people who...

40:25.000 --> 40:31.000
If you make the public very uncertain about most things by overloading them with information, or by even the...

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
It doesn't even need to be coordination.

40:33.000 --> 40:39.000
It could be a byproduct of having 24-7 access to the entire world's population through Twitter and Instagram stories and blah, blah, blah.

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
Right.

40:40.000 --> 40:46.000
There is so much I can no longer discern, even due to a multiplicity of opinions that's not coordinated to be a multiplicity that go in opposite directions.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
Right.

40:48.000 --> 40:54.000
If it was coordinated, the outcomes that are occurring at the moment, a lot of the time don't seem to be happening with people.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Just, oh, roll over.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
Tell me exactly what to do.

40:58.000 --> 41:06.000
There is a massive, non-insignificant cohort of people that say, I'm checking out and I now no longer trust anybody at all.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
Right.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
Or anything.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
Yes.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
And that doesn't seem to be...

41:10.000 --> 41:16.000
If the goal was ease of control, that doesn't seem to be effective for the person that wanted that or the group that wanted that to be the audience.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
What's the outcome?

41:20.000 --> 41:31.000
First of all, I'm really glad to get a question about this as a sea change, which is that our lives have become wall-to-wall uncertainty.

41:31.000 --> 41:43.000
We can't discern if the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor today, we would spend 10 years discussing whether it was a false flag, whether it was actually the Japanese, whether there was any attack, whether it was a soundstage,

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
whether it was a sigh-up, whether it was a...

41:51.000 --> 42:08.000
Right now, the main institutions of our society have abdicated their role for public-spirited adjudication of what is true based on expertise.

42:09.000 --> 42:23.000
And so what you're seeing is people coming to hate experts and coming to hate institutions because they're realizing that these institutions lie to them at a level that they've never considered unless they were Alex Jones fans to begin with.

42:24.000 --> 42:39.000
And so what you're having is you're having a large number of people waking up to the idea that, yeah, there really are organizations and working groups that determine what you hear from a multiplicity of venues.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
It's the same message relentlessly.

42:41.000 --> 42:45.000
Do you think people are overly pattern-matching that now?

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
Say more about what you mean.

42:47.000 --> 42:52.000
That they're seeing conspiracy weather isn't because the lack of faith in institutions.

42:52.000 --> 42:56.000
Same person is saying that they see a conspiracy and they see no conspiracy.

42:56.000 --> 43:05.000
They have part of their head that remembers that conspiracy theorists are crazy people and they've got part of their brain that remembers that normies who don't believe in conspiracies are crazy people.

43:05.000 --> 43:08.000
And they can't integrate those things, right?

43:08.000 --> 43:11.000
They cannot figure out how are these things being coordinated?

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Am I a crazy person for seeing these patterns?

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
Am I a crazy person for ignoring them?

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
For believing them?

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
For when they're unearthed?

43:19.000 --> 43:34.000
What you're seeing is a complete destruction of bedrock reality that if you weren't actually physically there, how do we know that these people actually met in a warehouse?

43:34.000 --> 43:37.000
Is this really a table or is it just CGI?

43:37.000 --> 43:40.000
Was it green and we could superimpose wood onto it?

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
Nobody knows what's true.

43:42.000 --> 43:48.000
And, you know, if you ask me, well, Eric, how are you dealing with this?

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
I would say I'm failing.

43:52.000 --> 43:56.000
I'm just flat out failing, as are all of you.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
I'm just more honest about it.

43:58.000 --> 44:04.000
Some of you have an idea that you've got one lens, which is fix the money, fix the world.

44:04.000 --> 44:05.000
Bitcoin, that's the answer.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
Yeah, Bitcoin, rock on.

44:07.000 --> 44:11.000
But no, that's not the answer.

44:11.000 --> 44:21.000
Or somebody else says, you know, I really think that we just need to be open and tolerant and realize it's a big world and we just have to give people their due.

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
Well, that doesn't work either.

44:22.000 --> 44:27.000
You can't just let everything run riot or we have to go back to our institutions.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
With these people at the helm, are you kidding?

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
We have to abandon our institution.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
Wait, what are you saying?

44:31.000 --> 44:34.000
We're going to abandon our institutions?

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
Do you know what that looks like?

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Nobody has an answer.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
Well, get back to talking to Eric in one minute.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
But first, I need to tell you about Gymshark.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
Gymshark make the best training kit on the planet.

44:45.000 --> 44:50.000
This T-shirt that I've been falling in love with and traveling in for a very long time is phenomenal.

44:50.000 --> 44:56.000
And these shorts, the studio shorts that they make are the best men's training shorts on the planet.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
They have lasted me over a year now.

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
They come in amazing colors.

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
The length is perfect.

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
They're sweat wicking.

45:01.000 --> 45:02.000
They're lightweight.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
They wash and dry perfectly.

45:03.000 --> 45:08.000
You don't need that many pairs of shorts as a guy, but the ones that you do have need to be very good.

45:08.000 --> 45:11.000
So if you need new gym kit, this is where to go.

45:11.000 --> 45:16.000
I highly, highly recommend that you go and check out everything that I use and recommend from Gymshark.

45:16.000 --> 45:20.000
They've updated my product page with everything that I use and recommend for men and women.

45:20.000 --> 45:24.000
And you can get 10% off everything site-wide with no minimum order.

45:24.000 --> 45:27.000
And they have 30-day free returns worldwide.

45:28.000 --> 45:31.000
You're sounding an awful lot parallel.

45:31.000 --> 45:36.000
The conversation is moving in a similar direction to one I had with Sam Harris recently.

45:36.000 --> 45:40.000
I would think it's very different, but I'm happy to hear more.

45:40.000 --> 45:45.000
He identified on an episode that I did with him not long ago.

45:45.000 --> 45:51.000
The fact that we have lost trust in our institutions and yet abandoning them is also,

45:51.000 --> 45:55.000
wholesale is also not an option.

45:55.000 --> 46:00.000
Sam also tried to say, I can see the problems on the,

46:00.000 --> 46:05.000
I say I can see the problems on the right and I can see the problems on the left.

46:05.000 --> 46:12.000
And there is a group of people who have allowed their irritation with the left

46:12.000 --> 46:17.000
to color their thinking to the point that they don't know what to do.

46:17.000 --> 46:22.000
I think Sam is discounting the idea that once people wake up to the,

46:22.000 --> 46:27.000
to the concept that they were living in an orchestrated Truman show,

46:27.000 --> 46:30.000
that they did not understand.

46:30.000 --> 46:33.000
They're not going to have the idea of like, oh, sure.

46:33.000 --> 46:36.000
The vaccines were a little bit more dangerous.

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
I don't know.

46:37.000 --> 46:38.000
I don't know.

46:38.000 --> 46:39.000
I don't know.

46:39.000 --> 46:40.000
I don't know.

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
I don't know.

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
I don't know.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
I don't know.

46:43.000 --> 46:44.000
The idea of like, oh, sure.

46:44.000 --> 46:50.000
The vaccines were a little bit more dangerous than claimed and maybe a little bit less effective

46:50.000 --> 46:53.000
and maybe we knew a little bit more about the lab lead.

46:53.000 --> 46:54.000
It's no way.

46:54.000 --> 46:59.000
You spat directly in my face and told me not only that it was raining,

46:59.000 --> 47:03.000
but that I was a crazy person for thinking that you spat directly in my face and you piled

47:03.000 --> 47:11.000
up how many Nobel laureates to defend the idea that any inquiry into the origin of this

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
virus was racism?

47:12.000 --> 47:15.520
It's like, you're dead to me.

47:15.520 --> 47:20.400
And I think that that's what people are not understanding in the Democratic Party.

47:20.400 --> 47:27.200
Increasingly, the basic attitude is whoever this class of people is that crawled into

47:27.200 --> 47:30.200
our elite institutions is just dead.

47:30.200 --> 47:34.800
Like, there's nothing Anthony Fauci could say at this moment that I want to hear.

47:34.800 --> 47:40.560
It's not that I don't think that he doesn't know virology or epidemiology.

47:40.560 --> 47:45.120
I know I can't trust him because of the way in which he looked into my eyes.

47:45.120 --> 47:50.640
And then, you know, when Stephen Colbert is dancing with syringes singing the vaccine

47:50.640 --> 47:57.920
song and Ariana Grande, you know, is in a super highly produced number from like hair

47:57.920 --> 48:04.640
spray but converted to vaccines with a giant picture of Anthony Fauci and everybody celebrating

48:04.640 --> 48:08.720
like it's a May Day celebration, I get it.

48:08.720 --> 48:14.160
I live in a completely fake world and I wrote an article about this in 2011 on K-Fabe,

48:14.160 --> 48:17.720
which is the system of lies that undergirds professional wrestling.

48:17.720 --> 48:23.760
So now you've woken up to the idea that you've spent your life watching something like Major

48:23.760 --> 48:30.320
League Baseball or Premier League Soccer or whatever it is, and it's all fake.

48:30.320 --> 48:33.240
And now you don't know who you are, you don't know what your country is, you don't know

48:33.240 --> 48:38.600
what a ballot box is, you have no idea what news is or media, you don't know what a university

48:38.600 --> 48:45.240
is actually teaching, you've got people running around who are calling themselves scholars

48:45.240 --> 48:49.480
who publish in scholarly journals and sit in scholarly seats and you can tell what

48:49.480 --> 48:54.080
they're saying is completely wrong and it's directly in their area of expertise.

48:54.080 --> 49:00.600
So the thing about pattern matching that I said was, there are still many people who

49:00.600 --> 49:07.280
are scholars, who are in positions of authority inside of high-faluting institutions that presumably

49:07.280 --> 49:13.000
do want to do good and do want to deploy their skills in a way that does this, is it

49:13.000 --> 49:24.920
a case that every single institution is completely wrong or is this reflexive skepticism being

49:24.920 --> 49:30.840
tuned up too highly to the point where there is skepticism about things that don't deserve

49:30.840 --> 49:32.560
it and how do we determine between the two?

49:32.560 --> 49:36.480
Okay, so we have to talk about the institutions that are fighting back.

49:36.680 --> 49:45.560
The future which has become X is not on the same standard that the Facebooks are or Google

49:45.560 --> 49:48.800
is, Elon is doing something different.

49:48.800 --> 49:50.560
We can talk about what?

49:50.560 --> 49:57.600
The University of Chicago is still fighting, my daughter just graduated from the University

49:57.600 --> 49:58.600
of Chicago.

49:58.600 --> 49:59.600
Congratulations.

49:59.600 --> 50:03.840
I never mentioned where she was while she was there.

50:03.840 --> 50:07.240
It needs support.

50:07.240 --> 50:10.560
We have to support the schools that fought back, for example.

50:10.560 --> 50:16.240
I believe Ohio State fought back and there's a school in Oklahoma that fought back and

50:16.240 --> 50:18.760
leading that charge is the University of Chicago.

50:18.760 --> 50:24.320
We have organizations like FIRE that promote free speech.

50:24.320 --> 50:29.360
We have professors who are taking on some risk like Jonathan Haidt, but we're not seeing

50:29.440 --> 50:34.240
the Noam Chomsky effect where you do amazing research and they have to put up with every

50:34.240 --> 50:39.160
crazy idea that comes through your mind.

50:39.160 --> 50:41.720
That's important.

50:41.720 --> 50:47.520
Look up a person named Serge Lang in mathematics and something called the file to understand

50:47.520 --> 50:52.320
how dangerous it is to screw with real scholars.

50:52.320 --> 50:53.320
What happens?

50:53.320 --> 50:55.960
Give us the 30,000 foot view.

50:56.280 --> 51:02.120
People tried to put Sam Huntington into the National Academy of Sciences who was an architect

51:02.120 --> 51:06.440
of the Vietnam War and Serge Lang just said, I look through his papers, I find the following

51:06.440 --> 51:07.800
mathematical statements.

51:07.800 --> 51:08.800
This is not science.

51:08.800 --> 51:10.760
Why is this person in the academy?

51:10.760 --> 51:13.000
Then they fight back.

51:13.000 --> 51:19.160
I fought back with Serge Lang when he was at Harvard where we tried to engage Sam Huntington

51:19.160 --> 51:21.000
on that topic.

51:21.000 --> 51:24.000
You can't have these dangerous people running around.

51:24.000 --> 51:25.680
That's why all of us are discredited.

51:25.720 --> 51:30.360
You haven't noticed this, but like Jordan Peterson is discredited, Sam Harris is discredited,

51:30.360 --> 51:34.560
Joe Rogan is discredited, Brett Weinstein is discredited, Ben Shapiro is discredited,

51:34.560 --> 51:36.680
Barry Weiss is discredited.

51:36.680 --> 51:39.400
Everybody is discredited.

51:39.400 --> 51:46.240
Tim Pool referred to it as the IDW's walking corpse phase at the moment.

51:46.240 --> 51:52.640
Well, my point is this personal destruction is the coin of the realm.

51:52.640 --> 51:56.520
Some of the personal destruction that you see that looks organic is orchestrated as

51:56.520 --> 51:58.000
well.

51:58.000 --> 52:02.120
We're just in this thing where, in my opinion, what you're looking at is something called

52:02.120 --> 52:06.360
de-confliction, but people don't know what that is.

52:06.360 --> 52:10.680
De-confliction is supposed to stop what are called blue-on-blue incidences.

52:10.680 --> 52:14.480
Blue-on-blue incidences, you have two branches of government that don't know that they're

52:14.480 --> 52:16.080
operating covertly.

52:16.080 --> 52:20.080
Maybe you have an investigative team and an undercover team, and the investigative team

52:20.080 --> 52:23.640
is about to blow the cover thinking that they've got a target, but it's actually an

52:23.640 --> 52:25.640
undercover agent.

52:25.640 --> 52:28.800
What they're supposed to do is they're supposed to check in with these centralized systems

52:28.800 --> 52:32.120
and say, do you have any assets in this arena we're about to move?

52:32.120 --> 52:33.120
Yes, we do.

52:33.120 --> 52:35.120
Oh, okay.

52:35.120 --> 52:39.680
They find out, and this is supposed to stop blue-on-blue.

52:39.680 --> 52:45.760
The interesting thing is, even though there are three systems called safety net, RIS safe,

52:45.760 --> 52:53.520
and case explorer, you can't use them unless you are an official part of the government.

52:53.520 --> 52:57.280
I called up one of them, had a half an hour conversation before I started asking about

52:57.280 --> 53:04.080
Jeffrey Epstein, and then they immediately said this call will be terminated in five seconds.

53:04.080 --> 53:09.160
Maybe it was case explorer for South Florida, something like that.

53:09.160 --> 53:18.560
What happens when you have a civilian that's not signed up for nondisclosure under no rules?

53:18.560 --> 53:23.800
You're an American citizen with full right to free speech, and you stumble on something

53:23.800 --> 53:26.880
that you're not supposed to know about.

53:26.880 --> 53:31.360
That is a deconfliction problem that nobody has ever solved.

53:31.360 --> 53:35.920
The first thing I'd like to throw out is if we have three separate systems to keep the

53:35.920 --> 53:41.880
intelligence community and local police departments from tripping over each other, what do you

53:41.880 --> 53:48.880
think we do when ordinary citizens get wind of something amiss that's some super-secret

53:48.880 --> 53:52.160
operation?

53:52.160 --> 53:56.560
My claim is, we discredit them.

53:56.560 --> 54:02.440
We pre-bunk them in the language of the GEC, I believe.

54:03.440 --> 54:10.680
We're all familiar with debunking misinformation and disinformation.

54:10.680 --> 54:14.000
You've got some disinformation that's spread it around, and we debunk it by giving you

54:14.000 --> 54:15.280
the truth.

54:15.280 --> 54:20.880
What happens when somebody is spreading the truth in a way that is unhelpful to a statecraft

54:20.880 --> 54:22.400
level narrative?

54:22.400 --> 54:27.480
Well, we didn't know what the words were, but we just found out, and it's you pre-bunk

54:27.480 --> 54:29.080
the malinformation.

54:30.080 --> 54:37.720
Now, if you didn't grow up knowing what malinformation is, here's a quick refresher.

54:37.720 --> 54:41.600
Malinformation is actual information, but it's harmful.

54:41.600 --> 54:42.600
Right.

54:42.600 --> 54:45.440
The equivalent of politically incorrect incarnation.

54:45.440 --> 54:51.600
Well, or you're trying to make sure that there's support for the war in Ukraine, and

54:51.600 --> 54:56.560
somebody actually realizes that things are much more desperate than they thought.

54:57.040 --> 55:03.600
Well, that would be deleterious to our efforts if the objective is to get Putin to capitulate.

55:03.600 --> 55:11.600
Now you have to pre-bunk the malinformation, which means destroy the reputation of the

55:11.600 --> 55:18.240
person spreading the information that's countering the official disinformation and misinformation.

55:18.240 --> 55:22.920
I can't work out why anybody's confused and why they're having trouble existing in the

55:22.920 --> 55:25.960
state and school kids.

55:25.960 --> 55:31.120
The point is, I've got all of these friends who are pre-bunked malinformers.

55:31.120 --> 55:32.120
That's what a club.

55:32.120 --> 55:33.120
What a club to be in.

55:33.120 --> 55:34.120
That's what I do.

55:34.120 --> 55:35.120
I'm a pre-bunked malinformant.

55:35.120 --> 55:38.120
There's never been a sexier title, actually.

55:38.120 --> 55:41.680
I spread malinformation, and I need to be pre-bunked.

55:41.680 --> 55:44.000
So of course, I'm going to be a grifter.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.160
I'm going to be, I don't know, a charlatan.

55:46.160 --> 55:49.400
I'm going to, well, he's over.

55:49.400 --> 55:51.440
Can we stop trying to make Eric Weinstein a thing?

55:51.440 --> 55:52.440
Blah, blah, blah.

55:52.480 --> 56:00.080
There's giant farms of people in bots that are dedicated to spreading bad feelings about

56:00.080 --> 56:02.200
anybody who's going to contradict narrative.

56:02.200 --> 56:07.880
Well, don't forget as well that the coordination doesn't necessarily need to be there because

56:07.880 --> 56:11.280
the incentives align online for...

56:11.280 --> 56:12.800
There's an emergent part.

56:12.800 --> 56:14.840
There's a non-emergent part.

56:14.840 --> 56:19.760
I will not agree with anyone who tells me it's all one or all the other, but part of

56:19.760 --> 56:21.680
this is actually coordinated.

56:21.920 --> 56:22.920
Yeah.

56:22.920 --> 56:32.480
So, close that loop on the agentic, sovereign individual existing in the world.

56:32.480 --> 56:33.480
Holy fuck.

56:33.480 --> 56:39.800
I'm getting bookockied with this total awfulness of information here.

56:39.800 --> 56:42.680
Bookocky just means splattered in Japanese.

56:42.680 --> 56:45.040
That's why it's not a terrible term to use.

56:45.040 --> 56:46.040
Absolutely not.

56:46.040 --> 56:47.040
Thank you.

56:47.040 --> 56:49.920
It's actually been appropriated by the adult industry in a way that I think the Japanese

56:49.920 --> 56:50.920
should reclaim.

56:50.920 --> 56:55.000
And Melissa Chen has probably done more to popularize this in intellectual circles than

56:55.000 --> 56:56.000
anyone else.

56:56.000 --> 56:57.160
So, shout out to Miss Melissa Chen.

56:57.160 --> 57:01.640
Melissa Chen and Bookocky in the same sense and something that we weren't expecting today.

57:01.640 --> 57:05.360
I think there was a period of her life where she would use it in every public appearance.

57:05.360 --> 57:06.360
Just sneak it in.

57:06.360 --> 57:07.360
Right.

57:07.360 --> 57:08.360
Okay.

57:08.360 --> 57:09.360
The Bookocky of the gaps.

57:09.360 --> 57:14.400
So, anyway, you have a situation where nobody knows what's going on.

57:14.400 --> 57:17.160
And I don't think Sam is comfortable, by the way, being here.

57:17.280 --> 57:19.360
Like, you're in open water.

57:19.360 --> 57:22.880
And you have all of these instructions about what to do when you're swimming in your land,

57:22.880 --> 57:25.240
which is, you know, try to align yourself with the shore.

57:25.240 --> 57:26.240
Don't fight the current.

57:26.240 --> 57:28.440
And like, that's not where you are.

57:28.440 --> 57:30.920
You're just in open water.

57:30.920 --> 57:34.840
And you're treading water and you don't know whether there are oceanic white tips around

57:34.840 --> 57:38.680
and you don't know whether you can keep this up for much longer.

57:38.680 --> 57:40.520
But there is no land.

57:40.520 --> 57:46.080
There's a big difference with Sam.

57:46.080 --> 57:47.080
Go a little deeper.

57:47.080 --> 57:50.360
Make that a little planer for me.

57:50.360 --> 57:55.080
You cannot trust Harvard or nature.

57:55.080 --> 58:01.360
You cannot trust the Office of Management and Budget or the Lancet or the Lancet or

58:01.360 --> 58:04.200
the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

58:04.200 --> 58:09.280
You cannot trust any newspaper that I'm aware.

58:09.280 --> 58:15.960
You cannot trust the CDC or the NIH or the WHO.

58:15.960 --> 58:22.880
Now, people will hear that and they'll say, oh my God, Eric, you're spreading distrust

58:22.880 --> 58:23.880
and fear.

58:23.880 --> 58:25.240
It's like, I'm a pastor.

58:25.240 --> 58:27.800
Shoot the messenger all you want.

58:27.800 --> 58:33.320
All of those institutions are out of control and we all know it.

58:33.320 --> 58:34.320
And say-

58:34.320 --> 58:36.040
And it's highly out of control?

58:36.040 --> 58:37.040
No.

58:37.040 --> 58:38.040
Mostly out of control.

58:38.040 --> 58:39.280
I did this on trigonometry.

58:39.280 --> 58:41.920
We have this anti-institutional point.

58:41.920 --> 58:49.360
How is it that the airlines can't keep my seat clean and can't make sure that I'm able

58:49.360 --> 58:55.600
to recline it properly or that the Wi-Fi doesn't go out and then their planes never crash?

58:55.600 --> 58:59.480
So the institutions are functioning and not functioning.

58:59.480 --> 59:01.240
They're lying and telling the truth.

59:01.240 --> 59:05.120
They're getting it done and failing outright over and over again.

59:05.120 --> 59:10.120
And it's even worse because if the planes crashed all the time and you'd say, okay,

59:10.120 --> 59:13.360
well, these people are incompetent.

59:13.360 --> 59:19.080
But it's like the selective incompetence and madness.

59:19.080 --> 59:24.320
And what I think is, is that Sam wanted to treat this as, look, it's pretty annoying

59:24.320 --> 59:28.600
what's going on on the left and it's pretty annoying what's going on with the institutions.

59:28.600 --> 59:34.080
But let's not lose sight of the fact, January 6th.

59:34.080 --> 59:35.520
People don't feel that way.

59:35.520 --> 59:38.400
People feel like, wait a minute, I don't know which end is up.

59:38.400 --> 59:40.200
I don't know who's telling me the truth anymore.

59:40.200 --> 59:43.760
I can spot these lies that are so transparent.

59:43.760 --> 59:47.600
And this is the theory of lies as a checksum.

59:47.600 --> 59:52.000
So when you get a binary for a computer program that you want to install on your computer,

59:52.000 --> 59:56.200
you want to know, well, is this what came from Microsoft or did somebody adulterate

59:56.200 --> 59:57.200
it?

59:57.200 --> 01:00:00.400
And when I click on this thing, it's going to install ransomware on my machine.

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:06.680
So there's something called a checksum, which is generated by how the program was compiled

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:11.160
and it would be almost impossible to come up with a second program that would generate

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:12.160
the same checksum.

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:13.160
Verification.

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:15.160
Yeah.

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:20.520
If the checksum is off, I don't install the thing and the checksums are all off.

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:22.400
And that's why people are going crazy.

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:27.520
And that's why, to your earlier point, isn't it interesting that we're not talking about

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:31.160
the level of uncertainty, right?

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:32.560
This is not sustainable.

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:36.360
So Sam is 100% correct on a lot of things that people are making fun of him for.

01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:41.280
And I assume that I will be keel hauled all over Twitter for saying this.

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:43.840
You cannot have a world without institutions.

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:45.320
We're not built for it.

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:50.160
We're just, there's no part of you that is prepared to generate all your own electricity

01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:57.320
and, you know, kill all your own game and get your own clean water.

01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:59.960
You need an army.

01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:01.480
You need a police department.

01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:08.720
You can only play frontier, you know, Wild West so long before you realize that modern

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:12.720
life can't be supported this way.

01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:17.020
And we can't go with the institutions we have.

01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:18.280
So we need institutions.

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:21.600
We can't go with these institutions, not because the institutions are wrong, but because the

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:28.280
inhabitants are wrong to a person they've been selected for by this ability to lie because

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:29.480
growth evaporated.

01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:30.480
That's one of my main rifts.

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:34.240
We don't have to go into it, but basically that in the absence of real growth, everything

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:37.280
turns pathological.

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:40.740
And so it's just heartbreaking to see some of these people saying, look, we've always

01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:42.440
known that the institutions were wrong.

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:46.080
We finally have the ability to prove that let's tear them all down.

01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:49.920
So that's a very popular perspective at the moment.

01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:53.680
Other people want to claim, let's cling to the institutions because we know we need them

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:57.280
and we'll look past the fact that they're obviously lying about almost everything of

01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:59.440
importance.

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:00.720
That's not really tenable.

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:08.120
We can't vote these people out because like Diane Feinstein could beat me easily in a run

01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:09.120
for Senate.

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:16.040
I don't know why because the machine is stronger than actually the vision we had for democracy.

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:24.000
So we've got Mitch McConnell having a temporary ischemic attack on camera.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.960
We've got somebody post-stroke in Pennsylvania having defeated Mehmet Oz.

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:30.360
We've got Diane Feinstein.

01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:35.280
We've got Nancy Pelosi trading up a storm.

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:37.280
We can't get rid of any of these people.

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:44.160
Joe Biden is way too old for this job and has been in government since he was 29 in 1972

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:46.080
when he won his Senate seat.

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:47.080
This is a joke.

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:49.400
It's beyond preposterous.

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:53.720
And by the way, it comes out of not loving your children.

01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:56.560
How's that?

01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:01.560
People who love their children don't drill holes in their children's life raft.

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:08.320
And the modern world at post-World War II was a life raft to get us to the next stage.

01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:19.200
And the number of older people I see liquidating everything so that they can live out their

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:23.680
final days in the same style to which they've become accustomed is impossible in a world

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:25.800
where people love their children.

01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:32.360
Yeah, I don't think they care.

01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:35.320
You familiar with Toby Ord's analogy of the precipice?

01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:36.320
No, Toby.

01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:37.320
Really cool.

01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:40.800
So his book, The Precipice, that everybody should go and read, it's my best primer on

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:41.800
existential risk.

01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:47.400
Toby Ord's from the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford with Nick Bostrom and he's a colleague

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:50.800
of William McCaskill, long-termism, EA, et cetera.

01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:58.560
He uses this example of, you can imagine, on a journey, a particular individual getting

01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:07.400
to a beautiful, lush, abundant meadow would have to take a treacherous mountain path.

01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:14.880
And along this mountain path, there is a particularly thin, small, steep, sharp, uncertain, unstable

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:16.160
part of it.

01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:17.680
That's the precipice.

01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:22.120
And he talks about, I like to think about it like an hourglass, you have width with

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:24.880
room and then you have a choke point.

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:27.840
And at that choke point, things can get dicey.

01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:34.360
And it's Toby's contention that if we make it through this precipice, you broaden out

01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:39.520
and you have the meadow, you are a multi-planetary species, you have redundancy, genetically

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:47.000
redundancy, civilizationally, you have overcome some of the limitations of the castoffs from

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.280
your energy production and consumption.

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:54.480
You don't have value lock-in in a bad way that means that it's despots all the way down

01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:55.680
or it's tyrants all the way down.

01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:57.000
I assume that I hear you.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Yep.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:02.640
Where do you think we are?

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:04.000
It feels very precipice.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Yeah, doesn't it?

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Yeah.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:12.920
What's more, as one of the only people who are really seriously hitting this multi-planetary

01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:17.580
note, there is no interest in this.

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.080
From who?

01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:20.080
I'm interested.

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:21.080
Are you?

01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:22.080
Fuck yeah.

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:23.080
Don't I count, Eric?

01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:24.080
All right.

01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:30.920
Am I not legitimate in the future of this civilization's direction?

01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:34.600
What are your best stories for how we become interplanetary?

01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:37.040
I say it because you brought it up.

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:39.000
Stories or strategies?

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.520
Stories about how we get to be interplanetary.

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:44.200
I'm not sure what you mean by story.

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:54.680
Tell me a story by which we have 10 planets that humans have settled.

01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:58.280
If you want to do 10, we're going to have to go to planets that are outside of the solar

01:05:58.280 --> 01:05:59.280
system.

01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:00.280
Right.

01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:04.200
There's this one which is really troubling.

01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:10.000
Mars is really screwing up this whole story because Elon has gotten everybody focused

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:16.880
on Mars and it's a marginal planet that would be very difficult to get to using chemical

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:23.640
rockets and it's not a stepping stone because once you master Mars, if, if, if, which we're

01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:30.240
not going to do, it doesn't really get you anywhere.

01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:33.040
It's just Mars.

01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:38.960
So Avi Loeb, new book that recently came out, Interstellar, spoke to him last week about

01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:39.960
it.

01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:40.960
He asked him about this.

01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:45.360
I said, um, do, will we ever visit other galaxies?

01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:48.560
And he made this cop out answer of saying, well, Andromeda is going to crash into the

01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:49.560
Milky Way.

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:50.560
I was like, that doesn't count.

01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:53.880
Avi, we can't blend two together and say that we've been there.

01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:54.880
Right.

01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:58.240
Um, and he's talking about, uh, interstellar travel, right?

01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:03.720
From here to Proxima Santori, pick, pick your other star, right?

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:09.000
They are trying at some point in the not too distant future to do the light sail laser

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.880
pointed added thing.

01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:16.560
Maybe we can, and this was me asking him, uh, my conception was generation ships, you

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:22.640
know, you and the next 500 generations of your progeny, you condemn them to be locked

01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:29.960
in this tin box and it's group sex and, and plants and CO2 for the next however long until

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:32.900
you get to Proxima Santori, hope that it's not totally wrecked.

01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:42.420
This point was light sail, uh, desktop DNA sequencer, artificial womb, send it out.

01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:44.740
You guys are being ridiculous.

01:07:44.740 --> 01:07:46.420
It's, it's a thought.

01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:47.420
This is my story.

01:07:47.420 --> 01:07:48.420
I know.

01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:49.420
This is my story.

01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:50.420
Okay.

01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:54.180
This is my story and I'm allowed to tell my story, but it's exactly why I wanted it.

01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:56.980
If I could, it just to riff, okay.

01:07:56.980 --> 01:07:59.980
It's an innervating story.

01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:02.180
What's that?

01:08:02.180 --> 01:08:06.300
We're not energized by this story, except for the, except for the group sex and the

01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:07.300
plants, right?

01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:08.300
Yep.

01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:10.900
So the issue is, if we could sprinkle some Bukaki in there, everybody would get on board

01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:11.900
a Melissa champ.

01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:18.340
Moving, moving, moving at light speed, um, what we're doing is that we're telling people

01:08:18.340 --> 01:08:25.620
we've crawled inside our modern theories and our modern theories make our imaginations

01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:27.820
our enemy.

01:08:27.820 --> 01:08:31.580
We're not excited about the, we don't really believe that we're going to open a wormhole

01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:35.860
we don't really believe in multi-generation ships.

01:08:35.860 --> 01:08:38.380
We don't believe that we're going to reboot from tardigrades.

01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:43.260
We don't believe that we're going to scan all of our synapses and reconstruct the brain,

01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:47.260
uh, from the beginning.

01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:50.700
Einstein is the problem.

01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:59.700
Now I know Avi decently well and Avi for the Galileo project that he's heading up, doesn't

01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:03.180
want people to consider new physics.

01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:09.700
So whenever I speak at all as somebody affiliated with the Galileo project with wearing that

01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:11.700
hat, I don't think about new physics at all.

01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:14.220
I accept the constraints of the physics we know.

01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:15.220
Yes.

01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:16.220
Yes.

01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:17.220
Yes.

01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:22.780
When I take that hat off, it's all about new physics.

01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:29.380
It's not about new technology using the old physics and the way you can measure whether

01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:36.420
people are serious about interplanetary is how much they're focused on new physics.

01:09:36.420 --> 01:09:41.220
Anybody who isn't focused on new physics is not serious about interplanetary.

01:09:41.220 --> 01:09:45.580
Is this because with the current conception of physics that we have, it's going to be

01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:47.580
essentially impossible for us to go into planetary?

01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:48.580
Yeah.

01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:50.060
And the word essentially is doing some work there.

01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:55.420
And so what you get is you get these innervating workarounds like, oh, if we use time dilation

01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:57.460
if we went really fast, then it wouldn't be that fast.

01:09:57.740 --> 01:09:59.500
Can you just explain the word innovating, please?

01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:01.740
Do you mean as an innovation, or is this ER?

01:10:01.740 --> 01:10:02.740
No.

01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:03.740
Innervating.

01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:04.740
What's that?

01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:15.120
Means to lessen in potency, to sort of discourage and as long as I have to do things that don't

01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:21.060
involve me cruising to new planets and taking in the, oh, it'd be your great, great, great,

01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:25.900
great, great, great, great, to the 12,000 power grandchild who actually sees a new planet,

01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:27.260
that's not going to work.

01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:30.780
Or you're going to open a wormhole, or you're going to have an Alcubierre drive,

01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:36.540
all of these sorts of things discourage us. And we know that we're telling lies about it.

01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:40.540
And so we don't work on it. You want to know how to work on this?

01:10:41.580 --> 01:10:46.380
We're abandoning the one field that has the chance of making us interplanetary.

01:10:46.380 --> 01:10:50.380
And I don't know what to do about it because nobody sees this as the emergency I do.

01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:54.060
We'll get back to talking to Eric in one minute, but first I need to tell you about cozy earth.

01:10:54.060 --> 01:11:00.380
Look, we spend one third of our lives asleep. You do not want to spend 33% of your existence

01:11:00.380 --> 01:11:05.100
inside of sheets that do not make you feel amazing. Cozy Earth has the best quality

01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:09.340
bedding. It's not just about what you sleep on, it is what you sleep under. And the quality of

01:11:09.340 --> 01:11:13.180
your sheets make a massive difference to the quality of your sleep. Sleep is the ultimate

01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:17.820
game changer and improving your sheets will improve your sleep quality. Cozy Earth is a

01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:22.540
premium bedding and loungewear company where they make the best quality bedwear. The products are

01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:26.860
made from super soft viscose from highly sustainable bamboo, the temperature regulating, so you'll

01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:32.060
sleep cool all year round. Best of all, they've got a 10 year warranty on all of their products.

01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:37.420
That's how confident they are that they'll last. You can get an exclusive 35% discount

01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:53.340
Okay, so let me see if I can get the topology of what you've said right.

01:11:54.700 --> 01:12:01.820
The fact that Mars is within reach broadly and chemical rockets.

01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:07.740
Correct. Of current technology, of current physics. And we do it. Hooray.

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:11.180
Super hard. We did it. Interplanetary. Right.

01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:20.700
But your point is that, well, it seems like that is insufficient and also kind of like a

01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:27.500
false duck type scenario where we did it, but we didn't actually do the thing we needed to do.

01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:34.220
So we may have even been better off had the nearest closest planet been two light years away.

01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:38.460
Assume Mars didn't exist. Correct. And assume that Elon was still the visionary

01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:44.940
that we want him to be. And he didn't have a chemical rocket company. I'd like to think

01:12:44.940 --> 01:12:50.380
that he would be focused on physics. I would like to think that any of these people would be

01:12:50.380 --> 01:12:59.580
focused on physics. Take anybody with 11 figures. What is your allocation to building a life raft

01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:05.020
to get humans out of here? You don't, you haven't even thought about it.

01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:09.740
Immediately you're going to think technology. Well, what kind of a whole would I need? It's

01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:16.860
like, no, you need a blackboard. You need blackboards and physicists who are not afraid

01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:22.860
to do physics. Right now we are destroying the fundamental physics community at a rate that

01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:26.540
you could not believe. What's happening? Give me the gossip from inside.

01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:33.820
For 39 years, we've been dominated by one community's madness. And that community is

01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:42.140
called quantum gravity, string theory or M theory. It changed what we were researching.

01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:47.180
It's cardinal sin is not about string theory. It's not about quantum gravity. It changed the

01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:53.580
questions that defined what it meant to be a fundamental physicist. So if I say to you,

01:13:53.580 --> 01:14:00.620
how many generations of matter are there? I don't know. You don't know that it's three

01:14:01.340 --> 01:14:07.500
because we don't talk about that all the time anymore. Or if I say, do you know why is matter

01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:12.300
chiral? You wouldn't know about that. Or if I said, what's the nature of the quartic potential

01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:16.540
for the Higgs field? Or why is there a Yukawa coupling in one case and a minimal coupling somewhere

01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:26.620
else? All of the real physics questions that would cause progress got subtly replaced between

01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:35.260
1984 and like 1987. And then we had questions like, how do we quantize gravity? And that became this,

01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:42.780
oh, that is the ultimate question. Well, it's not. That's just wrong. This comes out of Bryce

01:14:42.780 --> 01:14:48.780
DeWitt. This comes out of a guy who in 1952 went with his wife to the Tata Institute of Fundamental

01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:53.180
Research in Bombay, then wrote an essay for something called the Gravity Research Foundation

01:14:53.180 --> 01:14:57.340
that was about anti-gravity. And he was supposed to write an essay and then he said, well, to get

01:14:57.340 --> 01:15:02.780
anti-gravity, what you'd really need to do is to do quantum gravity. And for 70 years, we've been

01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:09.820
trying to do quantum gravity and it's an abject failure. And the physicists at the helm changed

01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:15.340
the questions. The official questions should sound something like this. Why are there three

01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:19.900
generations of matter? Why is it flavor chiral? What is the nature and the origin of the Higgs

01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:27.980
mechanism? Why are we in one comma three dimensions? And what is with SU3 cross SU2 cross U1, which is

01:15:27.980 --> 01:15:32.460
a bunch of symmetries? And why does it seem to represent on a 16 dimensional space with the

01:15:32.460 --> 01:15:37.020
observed quantum numbers? That may not mean a lot to you. But I guarantee you, if there are

01:15:37.020 --> 01:15:42.700
physicists in the audience, they're getting pissed off right now because they allowed their

01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:48.780
subject to be dragged away from our real questions for reasons that are unclear and put in the service

01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:54.140
of these questions that can't be answered. And we can't even question them 39 years into this

01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:59.580
complete train wreck that is the community that could build the life raft. What is so seductive

01:15:59.580 --> 01:16:08.780
about quantum everything? Quantum gravity? Yeah. It allows for toy problems so that you can not do

01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:16.620
your work on the world that we have. And you can say, well, world that we have is too complicated.

01:16:16.620 --> 01:16:21.180
So I created this fake world over here that's not in four dimensions. It's in two dimensions. It's

01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:26.140
not in Lorentzian signature. It's in Euclidean signature. It's not the full gauge group. It's

01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:32.220
just SU2. And I've changed all the parameters. And then I say, and I've made some minor incremental

01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:39.260
progress in that fake world. And then everybody claps. And meanwhile, 10 years later, you don't

01:16:39.260 --> 01:16:44.220
even remember what the particles are that are present in the universe. You don't even remember

01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:50.700
the standard model of particle theory. And this is a very real effect. Today's physicists, a lot

01:16:50.700 --> 01:16:56.380
of the young ones are completely ignorant about the physical world. They could not find the men's

01:16:56.380 --> 01:17:07.260
or women's room at CERN if their life depended on it. Yeah, so it seems like a hijacking of attention

01:17:07.260 --> 01:17:19.580
and focus from difficult problems to from useful difficult problems to useless or less useful

01:17:20.780 --> 01:17:25.580
easier problems. But if you try to talk about the real problems, you can't get engagement. And

01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:29.740
they will say it as, well, maybe people just aren't interested in your ideas. I was like,

01:17:29.740 --> 01:17:34.460
yeah, but you're not listening to it. So far as I can tell, everybody who comes from outside with

01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:41.020
an interesting new idea isn't being listened to. It's not personal. And we also have a responsibility.

01:17:41.020 --> 01:17:45.820
This is like, this is a really crazy part. We doomed humanity.

01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:52.780
Like Francis Crick, who was a co-discoverer of the three dimensional structure of DNA,

01:17:52.780 --> 01:17:59.100
was a physicist. Edward Teller was a physicist. Stanislav Ulam was a geometer.

01:18:00.620 --> 01:18:10.300
We doomed humanity on Earth. And then we're treating science as if, oh, it's a series of puzzles.

01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:14.620
Well, what do you want to work on today? Well, I don't want to be arrogant. I'll just work on

01:18:14.620 --> 01:18:22.860
this tiny little problem. And I'm just thinking like, do you not feel any basic responsibility

01:18:22.860 --> 01:18:30.380
after Hiroshima and Nagasaki and COVID? All right. Just how crazy are you?

01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:33.740
Is that, you know, we've spoken about the interplanetary

01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:40.220
challenge. Right. And the fact that physics needs to make some progress in order to facilitate that

01:18:40.220 --> 01:18:45.260
if we're going to do it. Yeah. Is, in your opinion, forgetting the fact that chemical

01:18:45.260 --> 01:18:53.340
rockets, limitations, all that sort of stuff, is going into planetary as useful. Is it the

01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:58.460
highest priority? The highest priority. You cannot stabilize this place.

01:18:59.020 --> 01:19:10.700
Just imagine every communalist dream came true. We turned away from fossil fuels towards a,

01:19:10.700 --> 01:19:17.020
the greenest new deal you could possibly imagine. All billionaires realized the errors of their ways

01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:23.500
and contributed their money to bring up the poorest of the poor. AI was as beneficial as

01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:31.100
it could be and only helped humanity to live its dream. Just go full wild, polyana optimism.

01:19:32.380 --> 01:19:34.700
You still can't stabilize it. Why?

01:19:38.700 --> 01:19:43.420
Too many people. Not for long. Say more.

01:19:43.420 --> 01:19:47.020
Not for long. Population rates, birth rates at the moment.

01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:52.860
We're talking at totally different scales. I'm telling you that with

01:19:54.220 --> 01:19:59.260
CRISPR-Cas9, with the Teller ULAM design. IVG.

01:20:00.540 --> 01:20:08.460
IVG. You know IVG? IVF, but being able to use from any other, yep.

01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:13.500
I was trying to think in a different context.

01:20:14.220 --> 01:20:18.060
You are going to have

01:20:24.140 --> 01:20:29.900
people, what happens when you distribute the coronavirus because everybody's had it? You've

01:20:29.900 --> 01:20:38.540
had it? I got an antibody test and I had it, but never felt it. You have this platform,

01:20:38.540 --> 01:20:43.340
this viral platform that's spread all over the world and you have the ability to edit it.

01:20:44.380 --> 01:20:49.900
Are you telling me that people aren't going to figure out how to come up with fun viruses and

01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:53.420
gain a function projects and people are going to be able to do these,

01:20:56.380 --> 01:20:59.340
polymerase chain reaction I think was taught in my daughter's high school?

01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:05.020
Are you familiar with Nick Bostrom's balls from the urn analogy?

01:21:05.020 --> 01:21:05.820
Yeah, vaguely.

01:21:05.820 --> 01:21:09.980
Yeah. For the people that don't know, you can imagine that you have an urn and each time that

01:21:09.980 --> 01:21:14.940
you make technological progress, you pick a ball out and you don't know what color. Some are white,

01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:20.620
perfectly good. Some are gray, a bit of good, a bit of bad and some are all the way down to

01:21:20.620 --> 01:21:26.860
black and black is permanent, unrecoverable collapse. And the unrecoverable bit is important.

01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:32.060
And each time we just keep picking out balls.

01:21:32.060 --> 01:21:37.980
So my take on it is there's already too much leverage, too much leverage, too little wisdom,

01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:38.940
too many people.

01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:42.700
What was it that you once said, we are gods, but for the wisdom we're just shitty gods?

01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:50.620
I don't know if I said the second part, but I guess when I heard the story about this kid who

01:21:50.620 --> 01:21:55.980
scavenged the americium from all of these smoke detectors in Brooklyn and built a self-sustaining

01:21:55.980 --> 01:22:01.820
nuclear reactor from these tiny little radioactive strips, you don't know what people's creativity is.

01:22:02.460 --> 01:22:08.620
You know, I found it fascinating when I was growing up that I was the only kid who knew

01:22:08.620 --> 01:22:16.780
that gunpowder or black powder was 75% potassium nitrate, 10% sulfur, and 15% carbon.

01:22:16.780 --> 01:22:28.700
Like you could just make it, you know? And that's the recipe. And that just blew my mind

01:22:29.420 --> 01:22:34.380
the rate limiting step was that people didn't know that potassium nitrate was saltpeter or

01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:41.820
where to get it, like meat tenderizer. But mostly we're saved from this stuff because nobody's so

01:22:41.820 --> 01:22:47.260
sociopathic and competent that they go for these high leverage attacks. That's going to end.

01:22:48.460 --> 01:22:52.380
You know, that was like what happened on 9-11. I always wanted to know why were little kids

01:22:52.380 --> 01:22:56.540
allowed to go into the cockpit of a plane? You used to be able to meet the pilot. I remember

01:22:57.420 --> 01:23:02.700
doing it. Yeah. So that's where we are now is that we've got all this high leverage stuff

01:23:03.340 --> 01:23:06.460
and you're going to see nuclear proliferation. Eventually you're going to get some

01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:12.780
desperate backed into a corner who says, well, this is my only move. Well, I mean,

01:23:14.540 --> 01:23:20.620
for the nuclear concernists out there, at least what I know, wouldn't that be all of us? Everybody

01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:26.300
is concerned, but for the people that are nuclear war is a genuine X risk, permanent

01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:33.260
unrecoverable collapse. You can set them all off unless there's like 10 to 100 times more than we

01:23:33.260 --> 01:23:40.460
think that we have, which they're very well could be. It seems difficult for it to be permanent

01:23:40.460 --> 01:23:45.900
unrecoverable collapse for me as a true, true, true, true X risk. May I say something? Yeah.

01:23:45.900 --> 01:23:53.180
This is ridiculous. It's bad enough that it would completely transform life as we know it.

01:23:53.180 --> 01:23:58.940
You would agree with that. Absolutely. Absolutely. It's time to get serious about

01:23:58.940 --> 01:24:04.380
things we can actually do. And the most interesting thing is that nobody's interested

01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:11.740
in interplanetary physics. I've never seen anything like it.

01:24:12.460 --> 01:24:17.340
Interplanetary physics would be physics in service of us becoming interplanetary,

01:24:17.340 --> 01:24:20.460
or is there something specific about the way that planets figure together?

01:24:20.460 --> 01:24:27.020
No, no, no. It's about... Let me give you an analogy that's more than an analogy.

01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:35.820
Assume that somebody hands you a physical paper map, an enormous one. And you're trying to navigate

01:24:35.820 --> 01:24:40.860
it on this table that we have here. You're starting to do motions like this,

01:24:41.580 --> 01:24:46.620
where you're moving the paper across the table to get from Los Angeles to Fresno,

01:24:46.620 --> 01:24:50.780
California, if it's at the right scale. And it might take you a long time to do that.

01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:55.340
Okay, but now you have somebody trained on an iPad. What are they going to do?

01:24:57.260 --> 01:25:00.380
Well, they might do that, but that's not the key thing they're going to do.

01:25:02.780 --> 01:25:07.900
They're going to do what is called multi-touch gestures. And the one that you're thinking of

01:25:07.900 --> 01:25:14.540
should be pinch to zoom. So the most natural way to do this is to treat it not as if it's

01:25:14.540 --> 01:25:19.420
a paper map, but a stack of paper maps. And you want to go to the one with a different scale.

01:25:19.980 --> 01:25:26.460
If you were doing this on an iPad that was mirroring this, the key point is that the paper map

01:25:26.460 --> 01:25:34.620
doesn't have an extra dimension to play with. But the pinch to zoom dimension is a scale dimension.

01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:40.060
So imagine what you did instead was you looked at your house, you pinched to zoom out,

01:25:41.820 --> 01:25:45.500
you then do this motion or whatever it is to get to your friend's house. And then when you land

01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:54.700
there, you expand it again. Imagine that you only know about paper maps, but your adversary has an

01:25:54.700 --> 01:26:01.180
iPad. That's what I'm worried about. We're not looking for pinch to zoom.

01:26:01.420 --> 01:26:03.980
What would that be in this?

01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:12.860
Well, I claim that there are going to be 10 extra coordinates. And four of them

01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:19.100
are pinched to zoom. And six of them are what I would call

01:26:21.420 --> 01:26:27.740
shear to tilt. So imagine that you have a copy of a picture of the Leaning Tower of Pisa on your

01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:34.540
iPad. You should be able to do something in paint, which changes the angle. So if you go

01:26:34.540 --> 01:26:38.460
into MS Paint, there's this little thing that allows you to change by a particular angle.

01:26:38.460 --> 01:26:45.900
But you could do that as a gesture. So my claim is if you have four dimensions of time

01:26:46.700 --> 01:26:54.060
and x, y, and z of space, you have pinched to zoom on all four of those. And then for any two

01:26:54.060 --> 01:27:03.820
dimensions like x and z, you have shear to tilt. So the first are the four rulers. And the next

01:27:03.820 --> 01:27:07.980
are the six protractors. And that's something called a symmetric two tensor or a metric,

01:27:08.540 --> 01:27:12.700
which Einstein knew all about, but he only chose one through his equations. And he let

01:27:12.700 --> 01:27:18.140
all the other ones lie fallow. And my claim is I don't think that's where we are. I think that

01:27:18.140 --> 01:27:22.860
interplanetary physics is going to involve moving from what we called spacetime to something called

01:27:22.860 --> 01:27:30.940
the observers, which contains pinched to zoom and shear to tilt. And you want to get off this

01:27:30.940 --> 01:27:34.460
planet, you're not going to get there using general relativity, and you're not going to get

01:27:34.460 --> 01:27:38.460
there using the standard model, it's time to take your pacifier out of your mouth and go back to

01:27:38.460 --> 01:27:44.620
doing real physics. I think if we were serious about this, we would be struggling with the physics

01:27:44.620 --> 01:27:49.660
of the world in which we live, not toy models, we'd be taking massive risks and listening to people

01:27:49.660 --> 01:27:55.820
from various perspectives who haven't failed or have not been invited to fully explain their ideas.

01:27:55.820 --> 01:28:02.540
And we'd be looking for things that would be new, new variables, new ways of working with the world

01:28:02.540 --> 01:28:09.180
that allowed us to do things that were previously considered inconceivable. So if you look at 1911,

01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:13.980
which is when I think Rutherford first starts talking about the neutron as a hypothesis,

01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:24.060
it's 41 years later, we have the hydrogen bomb. We can do incredible things that are not possible

01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:32.140
yet, because we don't know the framework. And my claim is, if you imagine somebody used to

01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:38.300
paper maps being put on an iPad, and not knowing about multi-touch gestures, that is pretty much

01:28:39.260 --> 01:28:43.500
an exact analogy of what happens when you do too much general relativity,

01:28:44.060 --> 01:28:48.860
is that you start to think in general relativistic terms as if that's the last word.

01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:51.180
Einstein would never have put up with that.

01:28:51.180 --> 01:28:54.060
That's a question you've mentioned, Einstein, a couple of times today.

01:28:55.820 --> 01:29:02.140
The most famous physicist of all time. How different do you think the landscape of physics

01:29:02.140 --> 01:29:08.140
would be had Einstein lived for another decade? Just how good was he?

01:29:09.260 --> 01:29:17.100
He was that good. The rare situation in which the man and the myth are roughly at the right level,

01:29:18.380 --> 01:29:24.940
the same level. I don't think you could solve the puzzle of theoretical physics

01:29:25.900 --> 01:29:30.300
and a final theory before the mid-1970s. We just didn't know enough.

01:29:33.420 --> 01:29:39.180
In particular, quarks in 1968, you needed confirmation, because they're not obvious

01:29:40.460 --> 01:29:44.620
in the world. They're stuck inside of protons and neutrons. And if you thought that protons

01:29:44.620 --> 01:29:51.180
and neutrons were fundamental, you wouldn't be in contention. I would say that the first time

01:29:51.180 --> 01:29:59.500
you could really guess the answer would be around 1975. I don't think Einstein was in the position

01:29:59.500 --> 01:30:04.940
to guess the answer. I think he was very caught up in a Romanian framework, which is that you

01:30:04.940 --> 01:30:10.140
deal only with length, angle, and the curvature of the space in which you live. There's a more

01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:16.220
modern viewpoint on this that he could have understood. I don't know to what extent he

01:30:16.220 --> 01:30:23.900
showed any recognition of it, but a lot of his thinking was really well suited for the world

01:30:23.900 --> 01:30:29.100
in which he lived, where he could do these thought experiments in his mind about falling

01:30:29.100 --> 01:30:38.780
elevators or train cars or whatever. You know, Dirac was every bit Einstein's equal.

01:30:39.900 --> 01:30:45.260
We don't know how to interact with Dirac, because Dirac was so strange. Einstein kept

01:30:45.340 --> 01:30:50.860
throwing off wisdom at an incredible rate. If you read ideas and opinions or out of my later

01:30:50.860 --> 01:30:56.860
years, you have an idea of just what a sage this person was, even when he's screwing things up and

01:30:56.860 --> 01:31:05.580
making mistakes. It's all sage-like. Dirac was the singular human being, and occasionally he says

01:31:05.580 --> 01:31:13.100
something about life. I think when he was given a Nobel Prize, I think shared with Schrodinger,

01:31:13.100 --> 01:31:19.100
he's given two speeches. He uses his lunchtime speech to talk about the bond market and the

01:31:19.100 --> 01:31:28.060
importance of using the toolkit of physics within any sphere that is numbers-based.

01:31:29.900 --> 01:31:37.580
We don't really know much about Dirac's views on humanity. We know about his beautiful aesthetic

01:31:37.820 --> 01:31:48.300
of the quantum. He gave the quantum poetry. I think that right now, it's up to us. They're

01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:54.940
not here right now. It's time to make guesses. I'm very partial to an example which happened

01:31:54.940 --> 01:32:01.100
on the Wheel of Fortune program. Fold this into the cutting edge of physics.

01:32:01.820 --> 01:32:08.060
Sure. I'm waiting. Okay. There's a guy named Ken Wilson who's discouraged all modern physicists

01:32:08.060 --> 01:32:13.180
from making guesses about the ultimate theory because he taught us that you can only observe

01:32:13.180 --> 01:32:17.660
the world at the energy scale that you're at. You and I are in a classical world. We don't see

01:32:17.660 --> 01:32:26.700
the quantum. On Wheel of Fortune, there was a puzzle. It said, okay, Fraser expression,

01:32:26.700 --> 01:32:32.220
there's one apostrophe in the first word with three letters, and it's a long answer,

01:32:32.220 --> 01:32:42.780
and person guesses R, and there are no Rs. Then I think that goes to the next woman.

01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:49.020
I think she guesses N. Oh, yes, there's one N, and she says, okay, I'd like to solve.

01:32:49.980 --> 01:32:56.220
The host looks at her incredulously like, well, I guess you could try to solve. She says,

01:32:57.260 --> 01:33:02.780
I will always remember this. I've got a good feeling about this, and it was right.

01:33:07.100 --> 01:33:10.380
You'd never guess that there was enough information for a solve.

01:33:12.780 --> 01:33:17.100
Whatever we have is what we've got. It's time to solve the puzzle.

01:33:17.740 --> 01:33:18.540
What would that look like?

01:33:20.860 --> 01:33:25.660
Ask somebody else. I try to solve this. I've got a theory, but Peter Wojt has a theory.

01:33:26.220 --> 01:33:30.700
I'd like to hear what the string theory think their theory is. I'd like to understand where

01:33:30.700 --> 01:33:37.020
asymptotic safety is. Everybody who's got a theory, whether it's David Deutch or Julian Barbour

01:33:37.660 --> 01:33:43.500
or Garrett Lisey, needs to come to a conference. Somebody needs to hold a conference and say,

01:33:43.580 --> 01:33:48.540
who can solve this puzzle? Let's put the sword in the stone, and let's let everybody try to

01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:53.580
pull it out, because now is the time. The idea that we're not doing this and that we're letting

01:33:53.580 --> 01:33:58.300
this community that has run itself into the ground continue to adjudicate what is physics,

01:33:59.260 --> 01:34:07.180
it's like, you boys haven't really done anything in N years. You're not the arbiters of what is

01:34:07.180 --> 01:34:12.860
science and what isn't. You've allowed this madness to creep into your university departments.

01:34:12.860 --> 01:34:17.740
You're signing loyalty oaths. I have physics professors telling me that their boss is some

01:34:17.740 --> 01:34:24.700
dean who writes to them about what they posted on social media. It's like, no, you're the boss.

01:34:24.700 --> 01:34:30.780
You, the professors are the soul of the university. Stop sucking your thumb. Stand up for what it is

01:34:30.780 --> 01:34:35.180
that you're supposed to be standing up for, which is excellence and research. Kick the people out

01:34:35.180 --> 01:34:40.940
who don't belong there, and invite the people in who do, and let's get on with it. It's just,

01:34:40.940 --> 01:34:46.700
I couldn't be more angry about anything else in the world. How can you take the lifeboat community,

01:34:47.660 --> 01:34:51.260
the only community that can get us a way out of here and run it into the ground?

01:34:51.820 --> 01:34:53.420
I like the term the lifeboat community.

01:34:55.260 --> 01:35:02.700
It's time to save everybody, and we've got huge responsibilities. We carry a lot of responsibility

01:35:02.700 --> 01:35:06.300
for getting everybody into this mess, and now we've got to offer everybody a way out.

01:35:06.620 --> 01:35:13.740
Yeah, it seems, I don't know. I don't know the inner workings or the machinations of the physics

01:35:13.740 --> 01:35:21.180
world, but the first time I ever spoke to Sabine Hossenfelder, she explained to me that physics is

01:35:21.180 --> 01:35:27.740
as much about politics as it is about physics. In bad eras, that becomes more true. Sabine's

01:35:27.740 --> 01:35:33.660
entire career has taken place inside of the stagnation, and she's like one of these

01:35:33.660 --> 01:35:38.300
truth-telling people. I think she's basically truthful. I disagree with a lot of stuff that

01:35:38.300 --> 01:35:42.620
I don't like that she, I think she does, which is a disservice to the community,

01:35:43.420 --> 01:35:46.380
but she is truthful that this community is off the rails.

01:35:48.060 --> 01:35:54.060
Moving from physics to something that you mentioned there, poetry, your cover photo on

01:35:54.060 --> 01:35:58.540
Twitter was the first thing that we actually ever connected about long, long, long time ago,

01:35:58.540 --> 01:36:04.620
and I'd just been to the Sagrada Familia. So I went for the first time to a wedding,

01:36:04.620 --> 01:36:08.780
a friend's wedding that he was holding on the outskirts, and it was very enjoyable.

01:36:11.900 --> 01:36:16.620
I had known about this building, I had read about it, I had seen all of the videos,

01:36:17.340 --> 01:36:22.140
and it's your cover photo. First off, why? And then secondly, what does it mean to you?

01:36:22.140 --> 01:36:28.220
What does this Sagrada Familia mean to you? I'm dying to hear, obviously we know it's important

01:36:28.220 --> 01:36:31.500
in my life. I don't know whether it had an importance in yours.

01:36:34.380 --> 01:36:39.340
Beyond beauty, no. It has no greater meaning to me than that. But one of the lessons that I did

01:36:39.340 --> 01:36:48.540
learn was, there's that quote about humanity will flourish when men plant trees under which

01:36:48.540 --> 01:36:52.860
they will never sit, something along those lines. And that's the first time that I've ever seen

01:36:53.820 --> 01:37:02.300
a purely joyful expression, architecturally, artistically, that was created with the intense

01:37:03.100 --> 01:37:09.740
intent purpose that that would be the end goal, that this is a, where are we at now,

01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:16.220
in construction, 70 years, nearly 100 now? How many? I don't know. But it's a lot.

01:37:16.220 --> 01:37:19.740
Still going. Yeah. So it's not done. And I think it's-

01:37:19.740 --> 01:37:23.740
And we can't even figure out what his vision is. So we've allowed other people

01:37:23.740 --> 01:37:27.580
to put their vision- Step in and- Yeah. Because there's only one of him,

01:37:27.580 --> 01:37:32.860
Gaudi. Okay. The ceiling of that thing, to me, is transcendence.

01:37:35.820 --> 01:37:45.340
You can't even believe it's real. There are things in this world

01:37:46.220 --> 01:37:52.620
that remind you of the transcendent in all of us, that it's possible.

01:37:58.220 --> 01:38:04.940
I can think of particular pieces of music or poems or pieces of architecture. I was just

01:38:04.940 --> 01:38:12.860
inside the blue mosque in Istanbul, which is a few feet from Hagia Sophia. And the

01:38:12.940 --> 01:38:19.660
interior of these two structures just are mind-blowing. And La Sagrada Familia,

01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:21.660
I mean, these are religions that I'm not a part of.

01:38:24.300 --> 01:38:30.540
If you're talking about the sacred family and you have a skylights to heaven,

01:38:32.780 --> 01:38:36.700
how better to honor the creator, whether the creator exists or not,

01:38:36.700 --> 01:38:45.980
than with genius and elegance and grace and humility and arrogance and everything that

01:38:45.980 --> 01:38:49.820
went into that ceiling. That ceiling is like nothing else I've ever seen.

01:38:52.380 --> 01:38:57.420
And you can touch- Sam Harris is famous for saying that you can either learn how to meditate

01:38:57.420 --> 01:39:01.340
or I can give you a few micrograms of the substance and you're gonna have a profound

01:39:01.420 --> 01:39:07.180
experience. Well, okay, just getting back from Sao Miguel and the Azores,

01:39:08.700 --> 01:39:14.460
you could take LSD or DMT or you could go to Sao Miguel. I mean, it's just crazy

01:39:14.460 --> 01:39:21.580
that there is that much beauty on earth. And I guess that space is something that I wanted

01:39:21.580 --> 01:39:25.900
people to understand. When I named the show the portal and people did not understand,

01:39:25.900 --> 01:39:31.260
it wasn't intended to be a show. It's intended to be a search for the actual portal out of here.

01:39:31.740 --> 01:39:39.100
It's an attempt to find pinch to zoom. I believe that we are not doomed here,

01:39:39.980 --> 01:39:47.500
but that we have developed this very weird focus on psychology. To challenge Einstein

01:39:47.500 --> 01:39:56.140
is almost seen as arrogance. And yet, if Einstein is to survive as a legacy,

01:39:56.940 --> 01:40:03.580
it's only going to be because somebody basically undermined general relativity status as a

01:40:03.580 --> 01:40:11.340
fundamental theory because we're not going to make it. And I'm trying to remind people

01:40:12.460 --> 01:40:18.780
in a world that now, like you can look up on Twitter, say lone genius theory,

01:40:19.740 --> 01:40:22.060
people don't believe in the lone genius theory.

01:40:25.660 --> 01:40:30.700
Well, then what was Gaudi? What was Dirac? What was Einstein? What was Yang?

01:40:32.540 --> 01:40:38.620
What was Emmy Nerder? Somebody tell me why I have all of these lone geniuses in my life.

01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:43.500
And aren't we supposed to be doing that and thinking that that's admirable?

01:40:44.460 --> 01:40:52.940
I think we're supposed to be building the theory that can realize that the ceiling

01:40:52.940 --> 01:40:58.860
of La Crada Familia is a portal. We're supposed to inspire ourselves with beauty and luxury.

01:40:58.860 --> 01:41:04.220
We're not supposed to consume it to pig out for status reasons. We're supposed to get ourselves

01:41:04.220 --> 01:41:11.260
into a state where we can dream at an interplanetary level. A lot of the things that we've spoken about

01:41:11.340 --> 01:41:17.420
today are to do with cerebral horsepower, cognition, the difficult things that need

01:41:17.420 --> 01:41:21.340
to be done in the head. And yet you're talking here about the transcendent. You're talking about

01:41:21.340 --> 01:41:26.620
something which is embodied, which is spiritual by whichever definition of the word you want to use.

01:41:28.620 --> 01:41:33.260
Do you find in yourself as somebody who does rely on cerebral horsepower for a lot of the

01:41:33.260 --> 01:41:39.420
things that you try to do and presumably takes pride in your ability to have workout problems,

01:41:39.420 --> 01:41:46.300
have thoughts? Do you feel attention in yourself between the transcendent, the relinquishing,

01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:53.260
the embodied, and the cerebral, the cognitive, the purposeful on that side?

01:41:53.900 --> 01:41:59.260
You know, I have a dumb expression which I don't use in public and I'm sure I'll be castigated for it.

01:41:59.260 --> 01:42:02.540
Yeah, brilliant. But it's head, heart, and loins.

01:42:03.180 --> 01:42:12.060
If it doesn't speak to your head, heart, and your loins, leave it for someone else.

01:42:12.700 --> 01:42:14.140
What's that mean? How do you enact that?

01:42:15.340 --> 01:42:19.260
You have to try to realize that these things have to be balanced and tempered.

01:42:20.060 --> 01:42:26.700
You don't want to live by your heart. Just every time, you know, you see a daffodil blowing its

01:42:26.700 --> 01:42:31.180
seeds into the wind, you'll be transported and you'll stop paying your electric bills.

01:42:31.740 --> 01:42:36.380
And you don't want to be led around by your loins. That's not going to end well.

01:42:36.380 --> 01:42:39.580
And you don't want to be led around by your head, too, because then you'll get yourself

01:42:39.580 --> 01:42:43.100
into one of these cul-de-sacs and you won't even realize that you can't think your way out of it.

01:42:43.100 --> 01:42:46.060
You were given all of these facilities and motivations.

01:42:46.060 --> 01:42:48.460
How do you pull yourself from head to heart?

01:42:49.820 --> 01:42:56.220
Well, you brought this guitar.

01:42:57.180 --> 01:42:58.300
A Gitalely.

01:42:58.300 --> 01:42:58.940
A Gitalely.

01:42:58.940 --> 01:43:01.100
It's just on your right. Grab it. Show it to everybody.

01:43:04.540 --> 01:43:07.580
So I don't, I do not play the Gitalely.

01:43:08.220 --> 01:43:11.100
I don't think anybody actually technically does play the Gitalely.

01:43:11.100 --> 01:43:13.340
It's like a guitar that's too small for your fingers.

01:43:13.340 --> 01:43:15.180
Yes. You've got your pixel in it.

01:43:17.180 --> 01:43:22.380
So you take some piece of music that actually means something to you, right?

01:43:23.100 --> 01:43:28.220
And one thing that I remember hearing when I was growing up was this.

01:43:38.380 --> 01:43:42.300
So it's the Asturias of Isaac Albanese. It was originally written for piano.

01:43:43.260 --> 01:43:48.780
And you see sort of these things on Ud where you have a tremolo.

01:43:48.780 --> 01:43:52.780
You've got two, two fingers playing the open B string,

01:43:52.780 --> 01:43:55.180
and then you've got this melody which is played with the thumb.

01:44:02.540 --> 01:44:06.220
So the combination of these things produces this different effect.

01:44:10.860 --> 01:44:12.460
I can't really get my fingers in there.

01:44:14.540 --> 01:44:17.660
And then I started thinking about, okay, well, that's a great effect.

01:44:17.660 --> 01:44:20.860
What if we tried to write and to create using the same idea?

01:44:20.860 --> 01:44:21.420
And I started,

01:44:24.220 --> 01:44:24.540
so.

01:44:24.540 --> 01:44:51.660
So that's not the same song, but it's using some of the same techniques about

01:44:52.380 --> 01:44:56.380
just getting these things to ring out and to get the melody going on the bass line.

01:44:57.180 --> 01:45:01.980
And then you have to forget this. Now, you know, if I was able to play this properly,

01:45:01.980 --> 01:45:06.380
and I'm sorry if I'm embarrassing myself, you're trying to do this thing where you're

01:45:08.780 --> 01:45:16.460
recognizing that the transcendent lives in particular structures,

01:45:17.020 --> 01:45:22.380
that they elicit this feeling, and that we have this opportunity to go back and forth

01:45:22.380 --> 01:45:26.460
between the analytic description. If I'm thinking about this, I can't really feel it.

01:45:26.460 --> 01:45:31.500
And if I'm feeling it, I can't really figure out how to use it or think about it or compose with it.

01:45:32.140 --> 01:45:38.700
And so, you know, to me, what we're trying to do is we're trying to

01:45:39.020 --> 01:45:49.180
camp and de-camp. Well, that spoke to my head and my loins, but it didn't speak to my heart.

01:45:50.220 --> 01:45:56.700
Or that spoke to two out of three. We need ultimately to be fully embodied. And that's a

01:45:56.700 --> 01:46:00.700
challenge. And we have to, we either accept the challenge or we don't accept the challenge.

01:46:01.260 --> 01:46:04.460
And we have to go back and forth between these lenses. You can't necessarily

01:46:05.420 --> 01:46:10.060
be in the same, you know, if you see your child and you're a physician or surgeon,

01:46:10.060 --> 01:46:16.220
you could see your child as a bunch of tissue hooked up to itself, you know? And that's important

01:46:16.220 --> 01:46:20.460
if you're hiking and you're in a bad spot, you actually have to do an operation on your child.

01:46:21.660 --> 01:46:27.020
But it's a terrible way to put your child to sleep when you're reading a bedtime story.

01:46:27.100 --> 01:46:35.660
Is there a, is there a challenge that people are facing at the moment with

01:46:39.020 --> 01:46:47.500
an over-reliance on a brain-based economy, an unlimited amount of information at your

01:46:47.500 --> 01:46:58.220
fingertips with Wikipedia and chat UPT for them to struggle to find something transcendent when

01:46:58.220 --> 01:47:03.340
it can be broken down into its component parts and explained by somebody who understands the child

01:47:03.340 --> 01:47:08.220
as a connection of ligaments, organs and blood vessels as opposed to as the beautiful progeny

01:47:08.220 --> 01:47:15.340
of the person looking at them? Well, keep in mind that there are people who can weave poetry

01:47:16.300 --> 01:47:20.460
through their description of something very technical. Herman Vile, for example, wrote in a

01:47:20.460 --> 01:47:26.860
very Olympian fashion about abstract algebra. He talked about the homosexuality of certain

01:47:26.860 --> 01:47:31.340
symbols as filiating with themselves, you know? Completely crazy.

01:47:31.340 --> 01:47:32.700
Ultrogyn arithmetic.

01:47:33.820 --> 01:47:41.100
And, you know, there are people who just write beautifully. I think that Jim Watson,

01:47:41.100 --> 01:47:45.660
who may be a son of a bitch on many fronts, is one of the great writers in the English language

01:47:45.660 --> 01:47:52.700
if you read the double helix. It's an incredible narrative from one of the most memorable first

01:47:52.700 --> 01:48:04.620
sentences to the conclusion. We need the Carl Sagan's to animate our head and our hearts

01:48:05.500 --> 01:48:10.140
at the same time. Do you think there is an over-reliance on head at the moment?

01:48:11.340 --> 01:48:16.140
I'm worried that our head, heart and loins are all disengaged.

01:48:18.620 --> 01:48:21.020
So what do you use if you're not using any of those?

01:48:21.020 --> 01:48:22.140
I use them all.

01:48:22.140 --> 01:48:24.380
No, but what are the people using who are not using those?

01:48:25.100 --> 01:48:29.100
They're not watching what's happening to them. They're being denatured by their phones.

01:48:30.860 --> 01:48:35.500
Your phone is not a phone. It is a very, it's an environment.

01:48:36.460 --> 01:48:41.500
You know, you pick it up and suddenly you're some place that you don't realize

01:48:42.220 --> 01:48:47.180
isn't relative to your physical surroundings. You get very angry that you get a text message

01:48:47.180 --> 01:48:52.940
while you're driving and you try responding to it. Well, you're going 45 miles an hour in a

01:48:52.940 --> 01:48:59.340
several hundred pound or a thousand pound vehicle. You've lost track of where you are.

01:48:59.340 --> 01:49:07.900
Our phone is, you know, and I talk to people about the crisis in pornography.

01:49:10.060 --> 01:49:17.580
The only fans movement, the pornographic stuff that you're seeing, people are not getting easily

01:49:17.580 --> 01:49:25.980
excited and aroused inside of any kind of context. Like the erotic is taking it on the chin, I think.

01:49:25.980 --> 01:49:32.780
I think that's really important to remember that eroticism, for example,

01:49:33.340 --> 01:49:38.620
is at least a combination of the loins in the head and it bests the heart as well.

01:49:39.900 --> 01:49:46.060
What you're starting to see is people can't actually derive excitement from normal stimuli

01:49:46.060 --> 01:49:50.380
that has to do with falling in love or having children or, you know.

01:49:51.100 --> 01:49:55.500
So you're talking about an ever-escalating stimulus that people require to get the same

01:49:55.500 --> 01:50:00.700
arousal response. And they can't. Yeah, Mary Harrington calls this one of her three

01:50:00.700 --> 01:50:05.020
laws of porno dynamics. It's the law of fap entropy that whatever you start out wanking to

01:50:05.020 --> 01:50:14.060
will get progressively more extreme over time. Well, what's the cure for that? Something high end.

01:50:14.380 --> 01:50:24.700
You could just try to do it all on loins. Show me something where my psychogenic arousal gets

01:50:24.700 --> 01:50:29.740
greater and greater because I've never seen that and holy cow is that far out. Or you could say,

01:50:30.300 --> 01:50:34.300
you know, it's more like a cob-douglas utility function. You're going to have to bring this

01:50:34.300 --> 01:50:40.060
down to my level. Multiple inputs. In other words, if I could offer you only food or only water,

01:50:41.020 --> 01:50:47.100
that would not work. You'd rather, if you have a lot of food, have a little water to complement it

01:50:47.100 --> 01:50:51.020
because that water becomes that much more valuable. Or if you have a ton of liquids and you have no

01:50:51.020 --> 01:50:55.260
nourishment, you probably want really value a little bit of food. Well, in my opinion,

01:50:55.980 --> 01:51:03.340
part of what we need is we need more things that reward us when we're integrating rather

01:51:03.420 --> 01:51:11.180
than when we're extra-mising. Get back to that discussion about technology, not only fracturing

01:51:11.180 --> 01:51:17.340
our attention, but also fracturing our experience. There seems to be a wistfulness, not just in the

01:51:17.340 --> 01:51:22.700
dating realm, but in the experiential realm for a bygone time where we felt connected to the things

01:51:22.700 --> 01:51:30.300
that we do. And it's interesting for someone of my age, I'm 35, so I'm like slap bang in the middle

01:51:30.300 --> 01:51:35.580
of the millennials. So I remember a time before ubiquity of iPhones, before internet,

01:51:35.580 --> 01:51:41.100
but there was like there's a whimsy of childhood in any case, and me being able to

01:51:42.140 --> 01:51:47.500
tear those two apart is kind of difficult. But I definitely think that when I read history,

01:51:47.500 --> 01:51:52.860
when I read Ryan Holiday, for instance, and I think about Zeno Obsidian walking around the

01:51:52.860 --> 01:51:59.980
Stoa Poíclei, where I've been, and I'm there, and I think about the degree of connection to the

01:51:59.980 --> 01:52:06.380
experience. What is technology and what are our smartphones doing to our ability to connect?

01:52:06.380 --> 01:52:10.380
So they're changing our, our wetwear. We're not,

01:52:13.020 --> 01:52:19.340
if you can have 12 life-changing experiences in the space of a minute and none of them are yours,

01:52:20.300 --> 01:52:22.140
what do you think that's going to do to your mind?

01:52:24.700 --> 01:52:29.580
You know, at some point I was in an oculus situation. I was deep underwater in a blue whale

01:52:29.580 --> 01:52:36.780
swam past me. Well, none of that actually happened, but it felt like it did. Or you know,

01:52:36.780 --> 01:52:44.460
that you can do this nuclear explosion on Henderson Island in oculus. That's just a more immersive

01:52:44.460 --> 01:52:55.340
phone. And look, you have to be, you know, that's one of the things about La Sagrada Familia.

01:52:56.060 --> 01:53:01.740
You go in there and it's real. You see the Grand Canyon and it is actually grand.

01:53:03.740 --> 01:53:09.820
You know, there's certain things that don't easily live up to their billing. I think I went to

01:53:09.820 --> 01:53:16.380
Pamukkalei in Turkey years ago, which Pamukk means cotton and Kalei, I guess, castles. It was a cotton

01:53:16.380 --> 01:53:23.180
castles of mineral deposits and they formed these pools. And there weren't enough pools and there

01:53:23.180 --> 01:53:27.180
were way too many people. So it was like one of those moments where the tourists have totally

01:53:27.180 --> 01:53:33.740
destroyed the natural attraction. Okay, but I went into the blue mosque and it was every bit as

01:53:33.740 --> 01:53:36.780
mind-blowing as it was the last time I was there 30 years ago.

01:53:36.780 --> 01:53:41.580
It's the same way that I feel every single time I step into the Vatican, every single time.

01:53:41.580 --> 01:53:43.980
Every single time. And I've been there three times now.

01:53:43.980 --> 01:53:45.100
I've been there three times.

01:53:45.100 --> 01:53:52.380
And it's just holy cow. Well, I shouldn't have said that. Anyway, very good. I didn't mean to.

01:53:55.420 --> 01:54:00.540
Yeah, you have to, there have to be things that you actually viscerally relate to that stop you,

01:54:00.540 --> 01:54:05.900
like the Bach cello sweets. How many times have I heard the Bach or whole lot of love

01:54:06.860 --> 01:54:13.100
could do it either way? Or you shook me all night long, you know? That's holy. You shook me all night

01:54:13.100 --> 01:54:18.300
long is a transcendent song.

01:54:23.260 --> 01:54:29.020
It's less transcendent if you see it as part of a 60-second TikTok montage.

01:54:29.020 --> 01:54:32.540
No, because the schmah is transcended and that'll fit right in there.

01:54:39.420 --> 01:54:39.900
Can't hit that.

01:54:39.900 --> 01:54:53.500
That's prayer.

01:55:00.620 --> 01:55:05.500
You know, if that doesn't move you, you need to check into some place.

01:55:06.060 --> 01:55:13.420
Those four notes recur in all of these songs that matter. It's basically Mary had a little

01:55:13.420 --> 01:55:21.020
lamb with pho thrown in as well. You know, and I bring up this example. My wife was watching

01:55:21.020 --> 01:55:25.820
a film. I didn't want to watch it, but some chick flick. And it all hovers around this one scene

01:55:25.820 --> 01:55:31.900
where this guy drags this girl into a music store because he can't afford a piano.

01:55:31.900 --> 01:55:41.820
He goes, I don't know you, but I want you. Going up to that fourth.

01:55:43.340 --> 01:55:51.180
All the more for that. And I was transfixed. I could not continue to do my calculations.

01:55:51.180 --> 01:55:56.540
Like, what the hell is this movie? So those four notes is a great place to ground yourself.

01:55:56.540 --> 01:56:02.940
And there's a reason that they work. The second note brings up in your mind the

01:56:04.460 --> 01:56:11.260
thing called the fifth, the dominant chord. The first note is spread between the tonic and the

01:56:11.260 --> 01:56:15.980
subdominant. The third note belongs to the tonic only and the fourth note only belongs to the

01:56:15.980 --> 01:56:22.060
subdominant. And so this idea that Western harmony revolves around these ideas of the

01:56:22.060 --> 01:56:27.260
tonic, the subdominant, the dominant are carried by these notes. So even if you're not playing it

01:56:27.260 --> 01:56:35.740
on a chordal instrument, that this pattern of four notes that keeps recurring grabs us because we

01:56:35.740 --> 01:56:42.620
know what the chords are behind it. And it's basically Mary had a little lamb or proud Mary,

01:56:42.620 --> 01:56:49.020
you know, but that's a great place to start for transcendence. Just check on something really

01:56:49.020 --> 01:56:58.540
simple, whether you're feeling it. All and dread to emotions that I miss in my life.

01:56:58.540 --> 01:57:03.820
Same one. So when I look up at the night sky, I get it in equal dosages. Oh, good.

01:57:04.540 --> 01:57:08.060
You know, when it's good, I've been out to Joshua Tree, taking an edible,

01:57:09.020 --> 01:57:13.740
didn't need the edible at all. That was unnecessary amplification. You know, we're having this

01:57:13.740 --> 01:57:20.380
discussion in the middle of the Perseids meteor shower. No. I highly recommend get yourself

01:57:20.380 --> 01:57:24.700
to a place where there's no light pollution and lay on your back right before dawn, you'll have a

01:57:24.700 --> 01:57:31.660
blast. Oh, and but the awe and the dread is very much there. Yes. And I don't know, it makes you

01:57:31.660 --> 01:57:38.540
feel insignificant in a way I think that keeps your ego small and helps to recenter your.

01:57:39.260 --> 01:57:43.980
Do you want your ego small? Have you been told that was a good thing?

01:57:45.260 --> 01:57:48.460
I've been told that it's a good thing. I would say for me,

01:57:52.460 --> 01:57:59.660
remembering finitude and not insignificance, but the

01:58:02.460 --> 01:58:07.420
temporary nature of our time here, the vastness of what is going to go on, the things that have

01:58:07.420 --> 01:58:14.620
come before the things that will come after the scale. Yeah. I think that it grounds me. I struggle

01:58:14.620 --> 01:58:21.500
to get into my head to describe the thing that is almost exclusively in heart and lines. And

01:58:23.820 --> 01:58:27.980
it makes me feel good when I do that. And yet I find myself, I've got emails to do.

01:58:27.980 --> 01:58:33.100
I heard this term the other day, John Lovell, Warrior Poet Society said the tyranny of the urgent.

01:58:33.900 --> 01:58:39.100
And fuck, I love that. The tyranny of the urgent.

01:58:39.980 --> 01:58:42.460
You're familiar with this concept of bathos? No.

01:58:43.340 --> 01:58:50.700
The alternation between the transcendent and the mundane and the pressing. We will conquer

01:58:50.700 --> 01:58:59.340
the cosmos, but I have to pick up my dry clean. Yeah, I think that there is that tyranny,

01:58:59.420 --> 01:59:05.980
but I also want to just talk about arrogance and humility. I meet too many people who have

01:59:05.980 --> 01:59:11.260
one without the other. And I see all these discussions online about so and so has this

01:59:11.260 --> 01:59:18.060
beautiful epistemic humility or somebody else's, you know, preposterously arrogant or whatever.

01:59:19.180 --> 01:59:25.580
And I sort of sit and wonder at this discussion. You want both.

01:59:26.300 --> 01:59:31.180
What is humility without arrogance?

01:59:33.420 --> 01:59:33.660
Well,

01:59:36.460 --> 01:59:40.780
you know who I think actually had this in kind of pretty decent balance that was on display

01:59:40.780 --> 01:59:45.660
for the world to see was Khabib Nurmagomedov.

01:59:47.820 --> 01:59:52.700
What an unbelievably good example. Right. So tell me how it lands for you.

01:59:53.660 --> 01:59:58.140
Khabib is very, very high on a list of people that I would love to speak to.

01:59:58.140 --> 02:00:03.900
And you hear that Khabib? Listen, Khabib, if anybody in Dagestan has got Khabib's email address,

02:00:03.900 --> 02:00:08.060
please tell him to get in touch. Okay. This is fascinating to me.

02:00:08.060 --> 02:00:16.300
So the more, I'll do a timeline of it. So Conor McGregor, very seductive,

02:00:17.020 --> 02:00:23.260
very obviously seductive, working class, the Irish hate to be told that they're a part of the UK.

02:00:23.260 --> 02:00:27.820
They're not, they're near, you know, close enough. It's like an adopted son type thing.

02:00:27.820 --> 02:00:35.900
Okay. And I'm thinking God disguised like a savant of war and artistry as he's coming up.

02:00:35.900 --> 02:00:42.220
And then he beats Chad Mander's and it's a war as a fight. And then he's crying.

02:00:42.220 --> 02:00:48.220
And then he does the other side of it. And he's doing with Ida Potal. He's balancing

02:00:49.020 --> 02:00:57.180
in the middle of maybe Vegas or California somewhere on a walking rail, on a side rail.

02:00:58.140 --> 02:01:02.860
And he's, I think Nate Diaz accused him of playing touch butt with that dork in the park.

02:01:03.740 --> 02:01:07.340
And he's doing handstands and he's got this sort of fluidity to him.

02:01:07.340 --> 02:01:13.580
And then there's this amazing interview that was clipped and put in perfectly of

02:01:14.780 --> 02:01:19.660
a journalist reciting back to Conor what he said before the Aldo fight. And he said,

02:01:20.540 --> 02:01:24.700
at the press conference, I saw his right hand shaking. That was a subtle tell for me.

02:01:24.700 --> 02:01:28.300
He's going to overload with that right hand. And when he thinks I will be that I will not,

02:01:28.300 --> 02:01:32.220
I will create gaps within that octagon. He will fall into those gaps. And that is when I will

02:01:32.220 --> 02:01:36.540
strike. And then there's a clip of him backstage before he's about to fight.

02:01:36.540 --> 02:01:40.300
And he's bouncing backwards and forwards in that sort of long karate stance that he does.

02:01:40.300 --> 02:01:44.620
And he steps back and he throws that left hook practicing and they placed it in time

02:01:44.620 --> 02:01:50.060
with the fight. Amazing. And it's the same move. And this guy says, you said these things,

02:01:50.060 --> 02:01:57.180
recites that thing post fight. How'd you do that? How'd you do that? And Conor talks about if you

02:01:57.180 --> 02:02:01.420
have the bravery enough to speak it and the courage enough to be able to pursue it then.

02:02:01.580 --> 02:02:08.940
And I'm just fucking enthralled by this guy. I got put onto a reality TV show in my 20s

02:02:09.660 --> 02:02:14.060
that we had no internet, no contact with friends or family or any sort of news.

02:02:14.060 --> 02:02:17.420
And it turned out that while I was there, I think it was Rafael Dasaños,

02:02:18.540 --> 02:02:21.980
it was injured. So I was terrified I was going to miss McGregor's fight,

02:02:21.980 --> 02:02:28.620
because that's how inspiring it was to me. And then there's this talk of this guy,

02:02:28.620 --> 02:02:35.900
this other fighter, unbeaten, undefeated. And it's the Bane Batman type scenario,

02:02:35.900 --> 02:02:41.340
at least that's the model that I had in my mind. And I'm like, you know, you've got the almost the

02:02:41.340 --> 02:02:46.780
Rocky versus who was the Russian guy that he's training for in the fight? No.

02:02:48.460 --> 02:02:53.420
Who's the Russian guy that Conor fights? The Rocky fights, sorry.

02:02:54.300 --> 02:03:03.580
Yes, I'm Dragov. So it's almost that, right? You've got this training in the mountains and

02:03:03.580 --> 02:03:11.900
chopping wood. And then there's the Dolly, Conor throws the Dolly, and you start to see,

02:03:11.900 --> 02:03:16.860
that was the first time I really took notice of Khabib. And you remember that video?

02:03:17.500 --> 02:03:20.620
Send me location. Send me location. Just tell me where.

02:03:21.420 --> 02:03:26.220
Send me location. And there's a number of tribute videos called the location,

02:03:26.220 --> 02:03:33.100
it's about with a K, about Khabib. I'm like, fucking hell. This guy is something else.

02:03:33.900 --> 02:03:41.260
This guy is real. Correct. Conor McGregor was spread between real and fake.

02:03:41.580 --> 02:03:51.740
Right. The showmanship was a part of, it was backed up, particularly by his striking,

02:03:51.740 --> 02:03:57.580
by his ability to sense his opponent, sort of almost using your antenna.

02:04:01.180 --> 02:04:07.420
But I really believe that in part, trying to get into your opponent's head with somebody,

02:04:07.660 --> 02:04:15.180
I really wonder whether Westerners have any idea of what happens in places like Central

02:04:15.180 --> 02:04:18.540
and Eastern Europe, when you start talking about somebody's mother.

02:04:27.260 --> 02:04:31.900
I had this really bad cultural reaction, which is that there are people who are bought into the

02:04:31.900 --> 02:04:40.700
whole trash talking thing. And if it had been like, I don't know, Conor McGregor versus,

02:04:40.700 --> 02:04:43.420
and I don't know how to pronounce it, Child Sonan or something like that.

02:04:43.420 --> 02:04:48.860
Yes, Child Sonan, yeah. It's a fag game. Yeah, they're both accepting the game.

02:04:50.220 --> 02:04:52.620
And with Khabib, I just had this other thought of like,

02:04:52.620 --> 02:04:58.620
have you never met anyone from Dagestan before? Yeah. Like anyone from Dagestan. It's not just

02:04:58.620 --> 02:05:06.860
Khabib. It's so bad. Have you ever done improv? No. Well, inadvertently.

02:05:07.820 --> 02:05:14.220
In improv classes, there's something called punking the game. Okay. And let's say that we're in a

02:05:14.220 --> 02:05:18.780
circle and we're supposed to whoosh, we pass energy around whoosh, and you can go boing,

02:05:18.780 --> 02:05:22.620
and it goes back the other way, and you can like send it across and stuff. There's only one rule.

02:05:22.620 --> 02:05:29.660
One rule is don't punk the game. Punking the game is like not playing by the rules.

02:05:29.660 --> 02:05:34.540
Game rejection. Yes. And what you see is Conor playing a game of tennis,

02:05:34.540 --> 02:05:41.260
and he keeps on serving this ball across. And I saw it 100% from Khabib's perspective.

02:05:41.260 --> 02:05:45.100
Not only does the ball not come back across the net, he doesn't even have the racket in his hand.

02:05:45.900 --> 02:05:48.380
You know, he's there. He's got to be there. There's obligations to be done.

02:05:49.340 --> 02:05:56.540
And it was that series of press conferences that really made me fall in love with Khabib,

02:05:56.540 --> 02:06:02.860
and then how it gets me emotional thinking about, thinking about his tribute to his father.

02:06:02.860 --> 02:06:06.220
I'm telling you, I can't see it from Conor's perspective.

02:06:07.500 --> 02:06:08.860
Of why you would behave in that way?

02:06:10.860 --> 02:06:16.460
Two seconds facing this guy is not a question of fear. It's a question of respect.

02:06:18.780 --> 02:06:23.260
Maybe I just don't get it. But I spend enough time, I have spent enough time

02:06:24.540 --> 02:06:29.500
in, I don't know, the north of India or the center of Turkey or places in Egypt,

02:06:30.940 --> 02:06:34.700
or Ukraine or Russia, wherever. You don't...

02:06:37.420 --> 02:06:41.900
I can tell the internet's gonna completely tell me I don't get it. You don't do this stuff.

02:06:42.540 --> 02:06:47.980
You just don't. It's like, I can't explain to people who are convinced that the internet is

02:06:47.980 --> 02:06:54.380
the gift to prove that dunking and dragging is man's highest function. There's so much stuff you

02:06:54.380 --> 02:07:00.620
don't do. And this whole move towards like anonymity and let's make fun of everybody and

02:07:00.620 --> 02:07:09.900
everything because mockery is good. This way, this is the direction to madness.

02:07:11.500 --> 02:07:17.180
I certainly think that, Peterson said this a while ago, one of the main problems with Twitter is

02:07:17.180 --> 02:07:23.820
it's driven the proximate price of being a prick down to zero. Sure. And the combination of real

02:07:23.820 --> 02:07:29.340
people and unnamed accounts and bot farms and the inability to work out whether it's been said in

02:07:29.340 --> 02:07:34.620
earnest or said in a... Or whether it's been coordinated so that 100,000 people go off at

02:07:34.620 --> 02:07:41.900
once on the exactly the same point. Getting back to the issue of arrogance and humility, what is

02:07:41.900 --> 02:07:57.660
Khabib? Competent, unwavering, humble. He's both arrogant and humble.

02:08:00.380 --> 02:08:07.260
And you have to look at the move that he does when you compliment him. What does he do?

02:08:07.740 --> 02:08:17.740
Alhamdulillah, right? Or Mashallah or something with the name Allah in it. It's like, I give you

02:08:17.740 --> 02:08:24.700
this praise. Oh, no, no, no. It's not for me. It's for the God, all for my father or for my father.

02:08:25.740 --> 02:08:33.580
And so this issue about... This is a beautiful thing when you have Muslim friends is that they

02:08:33.580 --> 02:08:43.980
learn to deflect all of this positivity out. If they're getting it, they deflect it

02:08:44.620 --> 02:08:48.620
so that they don't keep it and they don't become insufferable. On the other hand,

02:08:49.260 --> 02:08:54.140
if they're extraordinary at what they do, they know that they're extraordinary at what they do.

02:08:54.140 --> 02:08:59.420
Khabib is under no illusions as to how good he is. He set the highest standards for himself.

02:08:59.420 --> 02:09:01.660
Tomorrow night, I'm going to smash your boy.

02:09:04.940 --> 02:09:11.660
He is simultaneously... You said competent. It just wasn't fair to him.

02:09:13.500 --> 02:09:25.660
He's way beyond competent. I guess I just want people to realize that you need arrogance to stand

02:09:25.740 --> 02:09:33.660
up against insuperable odds. And you need humility to stop your arrogance from driving you insane.

02:09:33.660 --> 02:09:40.380
And to keep asking that people be constantly humble is an affront to what we are as humans.

02:09:40.380 --> 02:09:49.660
I really don't grasp it. You need that deep humility, 100%. But so many people need arrogance

02:09:49.660 --> 02:09:54.300
in order to take on the challenges that they could... If you took the world seriously,

02:09:54.300 --> 02:09:57.020
you'd never take on those challenges if you were just humble.

02:09:58.620 --> 02:10:06.140
Yes. One of my favorite clips of Khabib, post-fighting, post-career,

02:10:07.660 --> 02:10:13.420
he's doing an interview and talking about the training camps, the gym that he looks after,

02:10:13.420 --> 02:10:19.100
and some of the fighters that are there. And I think they train six days or six and a half days

02:10:19.100 --> 02:10:24.620
a week. And he tells them they need to get up. Some of the guys complain and he says,

02:10:24.620 --> 02:10:30.300
it's okay. You go home, your mom, she'll tuck you into bed at night, she will cook you dinner

02:10:30.300 --> 02:10:35.420
and tomorrow, you'll be comfortable. But that's not why you're here.

02:10:36.460 --> 02:10:42.060
Put that coffee down. Do you know coffee is for closers?

02:10:42.060 --> 02:10:48.380
Ah, yes. Yes. Good reference. Your name's Lavie. You call yourself a salesman,

02:10:48.380 --> 02:10:54.620
you son of a bitch? I just love... I really, really love this.

02:10:56.140 --> 02:11:01.660
I had a conversation last week and I was told a quote,

02:11:03.260 --> 02:11:06.380
self-love is holding yourself to a higher standard than anybody else.

02:11:08.220 --> 02:11:14.300
You know, I'll be honest with you, I get tired of these things. I think that there's a lot of men

02:11:14.300 --> 02:11:20.780
in particular looking for simple answers. And all of these things fall flat for me.

02:11:22.620 --> 02:11:27.660
They're front-loaded because they simplify things. Imagine that that's all that self-love was.

02:11:28.860 --> 02:11:34.220
Well, then I'd have a definition. But it's not going to work. And I think that this is one of

02:11:34.220 --> 02:11:40.540
the things that I don't know how to fight exactly is that we're in a world that's convinced that

02:11:40.540 --> 02:11:47.900
the truth must be simple. And all of these simple truths don't survive the collider that is

02:11:47.900 --> 02:11:55.260
modern social media. So I don't disagree. The problem with a truth which is boundlessly complex

02:11:55.260 --> 02:12:01.580
is that functionally, it's useless. And I'm so glad you made this point. That's the puzzle.

02:12:02.780 --> 02:12:07.900
We're now in a world where to do the nuance is to get yourself tangled because the internet

02:12:07.900 --> 02:12:15.020
is not friendly to nuance. On the other hand, to say something simply and crisply leads you into

02:12:16.140 --> 02:12:20.300
disappointing everyone who's believed in you. And you know, we were talking before a little

02:12:20.300 --> 02:12:25.020
bit about Christopher Hitchens. Yes. Tell me about your thoughts on Hitch. I asked Sam this

02:12:25.020 --> 02:12:29.020
question. Sam spent a good bit of time with him. What would the modern culture be like if Hitch

02:12:29.020 --> 02:12:36.140
was still alive? Hitch, I think, would have been forced to either self incinerate or

02:12:38.140 --> 02:12:43.100
adapt. And I'm not sure what you would have done. What self incineration in this context?

02:12:43.900 --> 02:12:49.420
One of the things that makes Christopher Hitchens a hero to so many people, almost oddly a secular

02:12:49.420 --> 02:12:58.220
saint, if you will, is that he held the promise that one could simply stand in some place that was

02:12:58.220 --> 02:13:06.060
reasonable and hold forth from that simple perspective like, yep, there is nothing to Islam.

02:13:06.060 --> 02:13:09.020
It is nonsense. It might be something he would say, or you might say,

02:13:12.700 --> 02:13:17.180
you know, free speech is absolute and you have every right to say anything you want. And I have

02:13:17.180 --> 02:13:23.020
every right to say and the better ideas will prevail. Now you watch what's happened with Sam

02:13:23.900 --> 02:13:30.860
and this question of Trump. Sam perceives Trump to be an asymmetric existential threat

02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:37.580
and was willing to go and back the idea that the Hunter Biden laptop story

02:13:38.780 --> 02:13:46.380
might not have benefited the election. And he's lost an enormous number of people who otherwise

02:13:46.380 --> 02:13:50.460
agree with him. And now what's the reasoning? The reasoning and something I, oddly, I,

02:13:51.260 --> 02:13:56.620
first time I met Sam, I went on his show to warn him that you can't just optimize for truth.

02:13:57.340 --> 02:14:03.020
You have to optimize. I said, I have four variables I can't live without. Truth, meaning, fitness and

02:14:03.020 --> 02:14:10.620
grace. So Trump is a fitness puzzle to Sam, which is if we allow Trump to destroy the country

02:14:10.620 --> 02:14:15.820
in Sam's mind, then we've lost fitness. There's no, there's no point in being truthful.

02:14:15.900 --> 02:14:22.380
And then there's a question about what is the meaning? Do you destroy the meaning of a democracy

02:14:22.380 --> 02:14:27.020
when you hold back information? Maybe you do. Maybe it no longer feels like it's an actual

02:14:27.020 --> 02:14:32.700
democracy. What is the graceful thing to do? What is the just and right thing to do?

02:14:35.500 --> 02:14:39.180
I am convinced that some of Hitch's positions

02:14:39.660 --> 02:14:47.980
were attractive because he was using his big brain to suggest that life could be lived simply.

02:14:50.620 --> 02:14:55.420
If we were just strong enough of character, if we were clear enough of thought,

02:14:55.420 --> 02:14:59.740
we could espouse something like free speech or reason, and it would be enough.

02:15:00.140 --> 02:15:07.820
Without requiring that we hold it up to a higher power.

02:15:07.820 --> 02:15:13.740
Or that you get caught in some very serious situation where you're in an edge case.

02:15:14.460 --> 02:15:19.820
Free speech does not exist in an absolute forum under American law.

02:15:21.660 --> 02:15:28.940
It just doesn't. We mentioned Miller versus California, which was a sort of a

02:15:28.940 --> 02:15:34.620
follow-on decision to memoirs versus Massachusetts. You don't have a right

02:15:35.980 --> 02:15:42.940
to broadcast pornography because pornography does not enjoy First Amendment protection.

02:15:43.900 --> 02:15:49.020
Now, how do you discern that pornography doesn't? Well, the justices claim that it doesn't.

02:15:49.580 --> 02:15:54.780
And there's a three-factor test for what is pornography, which was, I believe,

02:15:54.780 --> 02:16:00.700
attenuated under something called memoirs versus Massachusetts, but that was not allowed to stand.

02:16:00.700 --> 02:16:08.940
You're not allowed to necessarily endanger troop movements by blabbing information in a war.

02:16:08.940 --> 02:16:13.900
You're not able to slander or libel. There are all sorts of adjustments to free speech.

02:16:15.260 --> 02:16:21.820
And when you come at one of these perspectives from an absolutist frame of mind,

02:16:22.300 --> 02:16:27.020
you have to hope that you're not going to meet the edge case. A good example for me was the Second

02:16:27.020 --> 02:16:34.940
Amendment. I noticed that many Second Amendment types took an absolutist perspective, saying the

02:16:34.940 --> 02:16:39.100
right to keep and bear arms will not be infringed and don't bother me about a well-regulated

02:16:39.100 --> 02:16:44.700
militia. I said, okay, I'm not going to talk to you about a well-regulated militia. My question

02:16:44.700 --> 02:16:49.500
is, should the Davy Crockett be sold at K-Mark? And they would often say, well, what's the Davy

02:16:50.460 --> 02:16:57.900
Crockett? And I said, well, it's about 100-pound personal nuke. Well, first of all, I was very

02:16:58.460 --> 02:17:02.780
flabbergasted that a lot of gun enthusiasts did not know that there was a personal nuke developed

02:17:02.780 --> 02:17:10.060
by the United States. But then immediately, many of them saw where this was going, which is, okay,

02:17:10.060 --> 02:17:16.540
if we're going to restrict personal nukes at K-Mark, then you've got your foot in the door,

02:17:16.620 --> 02:17:20.940
the camel has its nose under the tent. It's a difference of degree, not a difference of kind

02:17:20.940 --> 02:17:25.740
all the way down. Exactly. So I think that personal nukes have to be sold at K-Mark,

02:17:25.740 --> 02:17:29.420
because the American population needs to keep parity with the American military.

02:17:30.540 --> 02:17:34.300
And then I say, well, do you realize what you just said? Do you realize that you've

02:17:34.300 --> 02:17:41.420
bounced out of your very simplified framework? They don't. And this is partially the problem,

02:17:41.500 --> 02:17:48.860
which is that if you can't talk about taste and trade-offs and balance, because it's all squishy,

02:17:50.300 --> 02:17:56.460
then you have all of these people running to these different ultra simplifications, none of which

02:17:56.460 --> 02:18:03.500
work. There's a quote from one of my smartest friends, Gwinda. A dilemma of tweeting is that

02:18:03.500 --> 02:18:07.660
you're aware of exceptions and conditions to your statements, but can't include them without

02:18:07.660 --> 02:18:12.300
turning an elegant aphorism into a clunky mess. So you must choose between writing

02:18:12.300 --> 02:18:16.620
tinniered garbage or getting torn apart by pedants and replies and quote tweets.

02:18:18.620 --> 02:18:22.940
I've chosen to fail in a particular fashion. No, but this is really important.

02:18:25.180 --> 02:18:28.700
I'm failing. How about you? Depends what your goals are.

02:18:29.260 --> 02:18:34.460
Well, but my point to you is I don't think we're meant to succeed here.

02:18:34.460 --> 02:18:35.980
What's that mean? What's the criteria?

02:18:38.620 --> 02:18:42.380
Was that a herd? What's the criteria?

02:18:42.380 --> 02:18:43.740
No, sorry, the person who just said that.

02:18:43.740 --> 02:18:44.700
Gwinda, no, a guy.

02:18:44.700 --> 02:18:52.780
A guy. What he said was that you're aware of the trade-off and there's no way out of the trade-off.

02:18:56.220 --> 02:19:02.140
I believe that there are ways out, but they have their own problems. Once you start to understand

02:19:02.860 --> 02:19:08.780
all of the different forces that are arrayed against you, you realize that if somebody

02:19:08.780 --> 02:19:16.060
chooses to hyper-focus on various things, they can effectively destroy your credibility in general.

02:19:16.060 --> 02:19:18.540
And you brought up Wikipedia and I wanted to talk about that.

02:19:19.100 --> 02:19:24.060
An interesting thing that's happening with Wikipedia is the difference between individual

02:19:24.060 --> 02:19:32.220
Wikipedia entries and Wikipedia entries on a subject or a plant or a geographic place.

02:19:33.980 --> 02:19:37.100
So isn't it strange that if you were to look up, for example,

02:19:38.780 --> 02:19:43.660
pneumatic drill on Wikipedia, there'd be a huge technically accurate article about

02:19:44.460 --> 02:19:45.340
pneumatic drills.

02:19:45.340 --> 02:19:47.580
Constitutes it. Who invented it?

02:19:47.580 --> 02:19:52.700
Right. And then you look up Jordan Peterson and I guarantee you it's going to be a war zone.

02:19:55.020 --> 02:20:04.780
And now you fuse these two things together, which is weaponized Wikipedia and factual Wikipedia.

02:20:06.300 --> 02:20:09.100
And this is like some really dangerous new object.

02:20:09.100 --> 02:20:15.260
And I always knew that Wikipedia, the genius thing that it was, had a finite shelf life

02:20:15.820 --> 02:20:20.300
because it made the fatal flaw of using authoritative sources as bedrock truth.

02:20:21.260 --> 02:20:24.620
What happens when trolls get access to bedrock sources?

02:20:24.620 --> 02:20:28.460
What happens when the State Department or the Department of Homeland Security

02:20:28.460 --> 02:20:31.420
or the intelligence community or people who hate you?

02:20:32.460 --> 02:20:37.820
That was the headlines that happened after my episode on Joe's show,

02:20:38.700 --> 02:20:47.740
where it was the weekend that somebody had nudged the definition of recession on Wikipedia to no

02:20:47.740 --> 02:20:54.700
longer be two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. And this was a Monday and it happened

02:20:54.700 --> 02:21:00.540
over the weekend. I mentioned it and all hell broke loose. It had already broken loose over

02:21:00.540 --> 02:21:05.500
the weekend. And then obviously anything Joe touches gets amplified to high heavens.

02:21:06.140 --> 02:21:16.940
And you're like, okay, so the definitions that we use, I think Shapiro calls it semantic overload,

02:21:18.860 --> 02:21:21.420
that's the battleground, ultimately almost all.

02:21:21.420 --> 02:21:26.220
Tell me the frame and I'll tell you the argument. Like somebody will say,

02:21:26.860 --> 02:21:35.020
you know, is it worth stopping Donald Trump by suppressing stories? Yes or no? Go.

02:21:36.380 --> 02:21:44.700
I was like, well, first of all, the question was designed to subsume that we have to stop

02:21:44.700 --> 02:21:50.060
Donald Trump. I might agree that with that. I believe maybe we should stop Donald Trump.

02:21:50.700 --> 02:21:55.260
But you did make that the argument and then you piled on a question on top of it and you subsumed

02:21:55.260 --> 02:22:01.180
that within the frame. And so more or less, this is everything at the moment, which is if you can

02:22:01.180 --> 02:22:05.980
define misgendering and dead naming, you've won the argument.

02:22:05.980 --> 02:22:09.980
You suppose there's a world in which, yeah. So I'll give you an example for the fledgling

02:22:09.980 --> 02:22:13.980
podcasters out there. When you first start doing a podcast, you're nervous that the guest

02:22:13.980 --> 02:22:18.620
doesn't like you. You're nervous that the guest isn't interested in you, that your question sucks,

02:22:18.620 --> 02:22:24.300
that your question doesn't make sense, and you're terrified of silence among millions of other things.

02:22:24.300 --> 02:22:29.020
Did any of those happen in this episode? Oh, you've been very welcoming. How could I know?

02:22:29.020 --> 02:22:35.740
After you serenaded me with you, Gitta Laylee, it was a perfect aphrodisiac. So what you do,

02:22:35.740 --> 02:22:43.100
and what I noticed with a lot of young new podcasters, is they do multiple choice offering.

02:22:43.100 --> 02:22:49.100
So I'll ask you a question. Eric, Trump 2024, what do you think is going to happen?

02:22:49.660 --> 02:22:54.060
Is it going to be that, and as soon as you say is it, and you then create either a binary or

02:22:54.060 --> 02:22:59.580
a trinary of options, you have now, not only, you've restricted for the entire universe of

02:22:59.580 --> 02:23:03.420
different things that you could have come up with, I don't know whatever you're going to say.

02:23:04.940 --> 02:23:09.580
I've given you two choices. So it makes it difficult for you to take a third because you

02:23:09.580 --> 02:23:15.340
need to say no and why, no and why, and then take the third. So you often offer up this

02:23:15.900 --> 02:23:22.540
very narrow, very unidimensional landscape. Exactly. And it ruins the conversation.

02:23:23.180 --> 02:23:30.700
It's funny. Lex makes assumptions in so many of his frames that I unweave, but I think he gets like

02:23:32.620 --> 02:23:37.340
some of the best out of me as a guest. And there's something about unweaving

02:23:38.300 --> 02:23:43.500
Lex's questions, which I hate doing to him because I want to just answer his questions.

02:23:43.580 --> 02:23:46.940
But on the other hand, there's something about the process of unweaving the assumptions that

02:23:46.940 --> 02:23:52.460
actually benefits some of our interaction. So I think that there's a lot of this

02:23:53.740 --> 02:24:02.940
just grooming us, grooving us to only think about certain possibilities. And

02:24:03.820 --> 02:24:13.980
what I don't know is how do you get nuanced thought to propagate at the speed of the meme?

02:24:13.980 --> 02:24:20.300
You need to make it sexy. Well, to an extent, I do this with acronyms and the acronyms have taken off,

02:24:21.020 --> 02:24:25.900
but then there's a different population that gets very angry, which is why are you allowed to create,

02:24:26.780 --> 02:24:33.580
we're allowed to create these memes with a distracted boyfriend, but you're not allowed

02:24:33.580 --> 02:24:41.580
to create an acronym to make a concept sticky. So what we're in is some sort of warfare for

02:24:41.580 --> 02:24:54.620
mind share. And I'll be honest, I'm not seeing high-level interactions the way I was five years

02:24:54.620 --> 02:25:01.900
ago between people. What's happened? I think that they've done a pretty good job of disconnecting

02:25:01.900 --> 02:25:07.420
us. You remember the old data and society report where you looked at chains of association,

02:25:07.420 --> 02:25:11.340
and the whole game was to tie everyone back to my loyianopolis or something.

02:25:11.980 --> 02:25:17.100
So I go to Interject, I go to Qatar to do this debate about masculinity about six months ago,

02:25:17.100 --> 02:25:22.540
and they put up on one of the segments. I was pro-traditional masculinity, and there was a gentleman

02:25:22.540 --> 02:25:27.980
on the other side, and they said, here is a montage of some unspeakable people that represent

02:25:27.980 --> 02:25:31.980
masculinity. And there was Joe Rogan and John Peterson and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

02:25:31.980 --> 02:25:37.660
but the first person was Milo Yianopolis. I said, look, if you have brought me to the Middle East

02:25:37.660 --> 02:25:44.140
to defend Milo Yianopolis, did you have brought the wrong person? I'm like, we need to shift that,

02:25:44.140 --> 02:25:48.700
get that to one side. Milo can go over there. Do you see his debate with destiny that he did

02:25:48.700 --> 02:25:56.300
a couple of weeks ago, maybe three months ago now? Milo looked like an old touring singer

02:25:56.300 --> 02:26:02.940
in a rock band, still doing the shows, but can't hit the high notes anymore. And the whimsy

02:26:03.820 --> 02:26:12.780
and that sort of playful jester-joker kind of game, gamesmanship, had been abandoned in place of

02:26:13.500 --> 02:26:18.700
bottom of the barrel, backbiting and genuine emotional sniping. And then destiny said,

02:26:18.700 --> 02:26:24.620
after he's been pushed and pushed and pushed for 90 minutes, he says to destiny,

02:26:27.500 --> 02:26:31.100
back in the olden times, they would have left your kind on the side of a hill to die.

02:26:31.820 --> 02:26:37.420
And destiny said, well, I think that the gays would have been left there first. Milo said,

02:26:37.420 --> 02:26:41.580
well, I don't think that you can tell whether a baby's going to like dick when it comes out or not.

02:26:42.540 --> 02:26:46.300
Destiny said, well, you'd know all about young boys liking dick, wouldn't you?

02:26:46.940 --> 02:26:53.180
Wow. And it broke Milo, it broke his brain. Sorry, what was that? And no one had any sympathy,

02:26:53.180 --> 02:26:59.580
because for 90 minutes, he'd called destiny's wife a public fleshlight. He'd said everything

02:26:59.580 --> 02:27:08.300
under the sun. Why are we dealing with these people? Because it is entertainment, it is mental

02:27:08.380 --> 02:27:16.780
masturbation, it, a story about people will always be more seductive to a broader group

02:27:16.780 --> 02:27:25.500
than a story about ideas. Got it. I think. Am I wrong? I don't know. I just,

02:27:25.500 --> 02:27:32.140
despairing. So much stuff, so much beauty in this world. And I just, I wonder at what point does

02:27:32.140 --> 02:27:43.500
middle school lunch table, when you compare it to amino acids, you compare it to,

02:27:51.260 --> 02:27:56.300
you go scuba diving? I have done. I suck. What's the most beautiful place you've gone scuba dive?

02:27:56.460 --> 02:28:05.260
Ghillie T, off the coast of Bali. Okay. I remember scuba diving off

02:28:05.260 --> 02:28:10.940
Manjungan Island in Bali. Amazing. But the Red Sea totally blew my mind.

02:28:12.620 --> 02:28:17.820
I can't tell you how little I care about Miloianopolis and how much I care about scuba diving in

02:28:17.820 --> 02:28:24.860
the Red Sea. I don't know. Maybe I'm just wrong. There's something wrong. It's just to get back to

02:28:24.940 --> 02:28:30.300
it. We all used to talk to each other. And then this thing started dividing us.

02:28:32.940 --> 02:28:37.340
You know, you started seeing all these messages. Oh, your boy said this. Your boy said that. Time

02:28:37.340 --> 02:28:44.860
to come collect your boy. Who talks like this? The internet. And then we stopped seeing each other

02:28:44.860 --> 02:28:55.980
in our feeds. And I said, well, this is Vijaya Gade under Jack Dorsey. Jack had gotten some system

02:28:55.980 --> 02:29:00.860
whereby he took his hands off it because he knew that terrible things had to be done, I think.

02:29:01.500 --> 02:29:05.900
And he just had this idea, well, if I have to intercede at Twitter, then something has gone

02:29:05.900 --> 02:29:11.100
wrong with the system. And you had this person who was just very happy bringing health to the

02:29:11.180 --> 02:29:17.420
internet, but it disconnected all of us. It was very clear that our engagement just

02:29:17.420 --> 02:29:21.820
dropped. And then if you complained about it, it was because you actually sucked and nobody

02:29:21.820 --> 02:29:28.300
cared about your tweets. You had no idea where you were. And so all of this kind of good feeling

02:29:29.420 --> 02:29:34.220
evaporated in part because people didn't know how to fight as a team. And this is just,

02:29:35.260 --> 02:29:38.220
I would love to get back to the masculinity riff a little bit.

02:29:38.620 --> 02:29:47.500
I don't think men know how to fight as groups. And it's a key part about masculinity. And it

02:29:47.500 --> 02:29:54.700
really makes me upset to see all of these people in individual masculine space. If you're ever

02:29:54.700 --> 02:29:59.660
faced with three attackers, two of whom have knives and one of whom has a gun, here's your best

02:29:59.660 --> 02:30:03.500
move. It's like, you know, you don't know. You've never faced this.

02:30:03.580 --> 02:30:04.540
You've never faced this.

02:30:04.540 --> 02:30:07.900
Is the best move to have a group of five friends with you?

02:30:08.460 --> 02:30:15.420
Well, first of all, yes. And having people's back.

02:30:16.780 --> 02:30:21.420
So this is something that I've spent an awful lot of time over the last couple of years thinking

02:30:21.420 --> 02:30:31.420
about. The definition of addiction is that you can find fulfillment alone.

02:30:32.380 --> 02:30:33.980
It's something that I heard a few weeks ago.

02:30:38.220 --> 02:30:49.340
The atomization of everybody, the generalized risk aversion syndrome that we are seeing,

02:30:49.900 --> 02:30:54.700
something called extended adolescence or slow life strategy from Gene Twengey.

02:30:55.580 --> 02:30:57.420
Talking about young people are getting their driver's license.

02:30:57.420 --> 02:30:59.820
Don't know it, but let get immediately from the title.

02:31:01.420 --> 02:31:06.060
People getting their driver's licenses later. They're partying less. They're drinking less.

02:31:06.060 --> 02:31:09.180
They're leaving home later. They're getting occupations, starting jobs later.

02:31:10.540 --> 02:31:12.860
Could this have been contributed to through COVID? Yeah, probably.

02:31:14.140 --> 02:31:16.620
But it was catalyzed. It was already a trend that was happening.

02:31:18.060 --> 02:31:25.100
It's affecting men particularly because male friendship groups are

02:31:26.060 --> 02:31:35.900
more fragile in some regards than women's. In 1990, the number of men who said they had zero

02:31:35.900 --> 02:31:41.500
close friends was around about 3%. In 2020, that number was 15%.

02:31:42.140 --> 02:31:43.020
That's insane.

02:31:43.020 --> 02:31:47.420
The most common answer to the question, how many friends could you call on in an emergency,

02:31:47.420 --> 02:31:50.620
is zero. The most common. It's not the average, but it's the most common.

02:31:51.500 --> 02:31:54.220
More people have zero friends to call on than have any other number.

02:31:57.580 --> 02:32:03.580
The challenge of modern masculinity relates to that addiction quote,

02:32:03.580 --> 02:32:08.060
the belief that you can find fulfillment alone. You see this in the sigma male meme,

02:32:08.060 --> 02:32:10.380
sigma male grind set. I don't know this.

02:32:10.380 --> 02:32:16.540
So you have alpha, beta, the sort of red pill, the blue pill, the purple pill,

02:32:16.540 --> 02:32:18.780
halfway between the two. I don't know this either.

02:32:18.780 --> 02:32:24.380
Okay. So the sigma male steps outside of the existing dominance hierarchy.

02:32:24.380 --> 02:32:27.340
He doesn't try to lead. He doesn't try to do anything. He is a lone ranger,

02:32:27.340 --> 02:32:32.380
Lauren to himself. Over the top of a lot of this meta meme, which is being created,

02:32:32.380 --> 02:32:37.980
is a guy called Chris Bumstead, who is a three-time, four-time classic physique champion,

02:32:37.980 --> 02:32:42.940
Mr. Olympia. Classic physique is they have weight limits, which means that they have

02:32:42.940 --> 02:32:49.420
a much more Arnold-esque. It's all about shape and sculpture, massive, but not a mass monster.

02:32:49.420 --> 02:32:54.620
Phil Heath was sat in that seat not long ago, mass monster. I sit down with Chris,

02:32:54.620 --> 02:33:01.100
this guy who is the face of the sigma male meme, perhaps the one of the driving forces

02:33:01.100 --> 02:33:07.260
behind young male belief at the moment. And I asked him, how much of what you've done and

02:33:07.260 --> 02:33:10.940
achieved in business, in personal life, and in your sport, could you have done on your own?

02:33:11.420 --> 02:33:17.580
Zero. I could have done none of it. I couldn't have gotten through the difficult times

02:33:17.580 --> 02:33:21.900
emotionally without my fiance. I couldn't have built my personal brand without my best friend

02:33:21.900 --> 02:33:26.060
and videographer Calvin. I couldn't have run my business without Vaughn and my other business

02:33:26.060 --> 02:33:30.860
partners that are here. I couldn't have done any of this stuff. And this is the guy that

02:33:30.860 --> 02:33:34.860
he's in the ice tub as there's dubstep music over the top of him saying,

02:33:34.860 --> 02:33:40.380
you don't need anybody else and so on and so forth. The belief that you can find fulfillment alone

02:33:41.180 --> 02:33:52.140
is a lie. It is a lie that people who have been hurt and scorned and rejected by the world

02:33:52.140 --> 02:33:59.020
retreat into. There is a safety blanket of cynicism that people can use. It's sour grapes at an

02:33:59.020 --> 02:34:05.740
existential level. The belief that the upside of never trying is never having to feel the pain of

02:34:05.740 --> 02:34:13.900
failure. And the generalized risk aversion, the extended adolescence, the slow life strategy

02:34:14.700 --> 02:34:19.660
permits that to seep ever more into people's lives. In a world where we have hyper convenience,

02:34:19.660 --> 02:34:29.660
why should I feel discomfort? So what's going on with the modern masculinity movement?

02:34:30.540 --> 02:34:35.900
It's fractured. So there is the manosphere, which is the broad term that describes people

02:34:35.900 --> 02:34:41.500
talking to men. I've never identified with it. I'm not a part of it. In as much as I speak to men

02:34:41.500 --> 02:34:46.140
about things that I struggled with and they listen, perhaps someone could put me in it,

02:34:46.140 --> 02:34:50.540
but I don't think that they help. I think fundamentally at the moment the masculinity

02:34:50.540 --> 02:34:54.540
movement sees women as adversaries and competitors rather than compatriots.

02:34:55.500 --> 02:35:02.620
I think that they treat women largely like an enemy to be avoided or a resource to be used

02:35:02.620 --> 02:35:09.980
and discarded. I think that largely much of men's advice benefits some men at the expense of most

02:35:09.980 --> 02:35:15.180
others that if being a high value man means sleeping with as many women as possible,

02:35:15.180 --> 02:35:20.540
but a low value woman is a woman that slept with many men, what you are doing is creating a wake

02:35:20.540 --> 02:35:26.300
after you that other men have to pick up the pieces of if your goal is to be this high value,

02:35:27.340 --> 02:35:36.540
many high body count male. Let me give you this. So this is actually going into a paper,

02:35:36.540 --> 02:35:41.500
my first academic paper that I've ever been a part of. So this is the male sedation hypothesis.

02:35:42.060 --> 02:35:48.140
Okay. There's an effect called young male syndrome. You heard of this?

02:35:48.140 --> 02:35:53.980
Nope. If you have a large number of dispossessed sexless men throughout all of history,

02:35:53.980 --> 02:35:57.740
bad things happen. Yeah. Testosterone drops when you get in a relationship and drops again

02:35:57.740 --> 02:36:03.740
once you have kids. This means in large part that women domesticate men in some regard.

02:36:03.740 --> 02:36:08.540
They have to. You don't want to take risk taking behavior when you've got a newborn at home. Don't

02:36:08.540 --> 02:36:16.220
jump off that fucking cliff. Okay. Like let's be, go home, go home. So when you have

02:36:16.220 --> 02:36:18.940
large numbers of dispossessed young men who aren't having sex,

02:36:20.060 --> 02:36:26.780
what's the reason for integrating into society? They take a brilliant study is done of men crossing

02:36:26.780 --> 02:36:30.380
the road and the difference between when they cross and the distance from the nearest car

02:36:31.340 --> 02:36:35.420
with or without the presence of women. You put a woman there, the distance

02:36:35.500 --> 02:36:39.740
closes massively. No women there. They're not bothered. Risk taking behavior is a show. Look

02:36:39.740 --> 02:36:43.500
at my excess fitness. Yeah. Look at all of these risks that I can take. Look at the plumage on the

02:36:43.500 --> 02:36:51.500
back of my tail, right? So throughout all of history, it seems like they set cars on fire and

02:36:51.500 --> 02:37:00.220
push over granny and cause havoc. In Portugal, 1700s, the first son, there was a disparity in

02:37:00.220 --> 02:37:05.500
the sex ratio. I'm not sure why the first son was allowed to marry. Every subsequent son was put

02:37:05.500 --> 02:37:11.900
on a ship, go explore the new world. Don't burn our home was what they were saying. There is a

02:37:11.900 --> 02:37:17.820
question. We have very high rates of sexlessness and we have very low rates of integration amongst

02:37:17.820 --> 02:37:22.220
young men at the moment. Why are we not seeing them going around and setting a setting cars on

02:37:22.220 --> 02:37:30.780
fire? Jordan Peterson was featured as the incel god. He inspired a movie by Olivia Wilde

02:37:30.780 --> 02:37:33.740
starring Harry Styles a little while ago. I brought it up to Jordan.

02:37:36.540 --> 02:37:43.580
The incel god? He was the king of the incels. Yes, this incel. I am so pissed to hear this.

02:37:44.380 --> 02:37:50.300
Jordan laughed it off in classic him fashion. Yeah, but as a guy who opened for Jordan Peterson

02:37:50.300 --> 02:37:58.060
on Harmonica, I've been to some of his shows. Jordan Peterson recognized this demographic

02:37:58.060 --> 02:38:06.780
early and he had the courage to speak directly to it. If you want to see me break out in tears,

02:38:07.420 --> 02:38:12.620
have me tell you the stories about the people who went up to Jordan Peterson and said,

02:38:12.620 --> 02:38:19.420
I was smoking weed, masturbating in my parents' basement. Six months later, I've got a job,

02:38:19.420 --> 02:38:28.140
I've got prospects, I've got a fiance, et cetera, et cetera. To turn him into the incel king or

02:38:28.140 --> 02:38:34.380
whatever, no, Jordan Peterson tried to become the one person answer to the world uncle shortage.

02:38:39.020 --> 02:38:46.780
I just have no patience for dismissing that much good. If some of his message seemed off to you,

02:38:46.860 --> 02:38:51.340
it's because you didn't need it. You didn't understand what clean your room was about.

02:38:51.340 --> 02:38:57.340
You laughed it off because you weren't screwed. He gave people a path just the way Sam gave people

02:38:57.340 --> 02:39:03.660
a path from that abusive religious household where they didn't know to escape. To an extent,

02:39:04.940 --> 02:39:11.820
all of these people spoke to people at different stages of their lives. A lot of this female

02:39:11.820 --> 02:39:16.620
behavior which is, oh, I'm on only fans, I'm going to get my this, I'm going to get my that.

02:39:16.620 --> 02:39:26.540
Well, good luck to you. I hope it works out. The gold digging or the misogyny, it's of a piece.

02:39:26.540 --> 02:39:31.420
People are listening to each other's strategic conversation and saying, why would I want that

02:39:31.420 --> 02:39:38.060
for my life? I'll round out the sedation hypothesis. You have this large cohort, dispossessed young

02:39:38.060 --> 02:39:42.460
men, high tea, high risk taking, they cause problems. There is a question to be asked,

02:39:42.460 --> 02:39:48.060
although many of the almost all mass shooters, including the ones that hit all of the headlines,

02:39:48.060 --> 02:39:55.020
were sexless young men. Given that we have the highest rates of sexlessness amongst young men

02:39:55.020 --> 02:39:59.180
that we've seen in a very long time, there is a question, why have we not seen an in kind

02:39:59.180 --> 02:40:06.220
increase in antisocial behavior? It's my belief that young men specifically are being sedated

02:40:06.220 --> 02:40:12.700
out of their status seeking and risk taking and reproductive behavior through a combination of

02:40:12.700 --> 02:40:19.340
social media, porn and video games. I was waiting for it. So there is an idea from Diana. Sorry,

02:40:19.340 --> 02:40:22.940
social media, porn and video games does not include weed.

02:40:22.940 --> 02:40:28.380
I think ubiquitous weed.

02:40:31.420 --> 02:40:32.540
The motivation killer?

02:40:37.020 --> 02:40:41.900
We don't have a ton of culture around open weed. We have a lot of culture around open alcohol,

02:40:41.900 --> 02:40:47.260
about open coffee. We used to have culture around open nicotine. We don't have a lot of

02:40:48.460 --> 02:40:51.100
culture around open weed. We have culture around closed weed,

02:40:51.740 --> 02:40:54.860
served dishes weed. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I do think that in part,

02:40:55.660 --> 02:41:00.540
the video game thing is an absolute as if drug. What's that?

02:41:02.300 --> 02:41:07.020
You meet people who come from the gaming community or social media and they have an idea

02:41:07.020 --> 02:41:14.060
that life permits you to do certain things that are absolutely not tolerated in civil society.

02:41:15.020 --> 02:41:21.900
Like a lot of the people, an interesting feature of social media is the difference between critics

02:41:21.900 --> 02:41:28.300
and trolls who call you names and people who actually try to find a way to ruin your life offline.

02:41:29.660 --> 02:41:36.140
Like there's a huge connection between the gaming community and certain sort of bulletin boards

02:41:36.780 --> 02:41:41.340
and this freak game about how can we destroy people offline?

02:41:42.220 --> 02:41:51.980
Yeah, yeah. And once you meet these people and you read their messages to each other,

02:41:51.980 --> 02:41:56.460
they're talking about, oh, yeah, I've got a cool exploit where I'm going to invite somebody to

02:41:56.460 --> 02:42:00.700
someone's house because I think that person might be dangerous. You realize it's a video game.

02:42:02.540 --> 02:42:08.460
Yeah, so I had this idea specifically about Jordan, but it would apply to yourself. It would

02:42:08.540 --> 02:42:17.020
apply to Joe. After a while, there is a particular threshold of exposure and notoriety that people

02:42:17.020 --> 02:42:25.020
cross. And when they do, they are no longer treated like a human. It's easy online to dehumanize

02:42:25.020 --> 02:42:29.820
because you don't see any there, there, you don't see that. But there's something specific about

02:42:29.820 --> 02:42:34.460
crossing a particular threshold where you're no longer a person, you're a representation of ideas,

02:42:34.460 --> 02:42:41.100
you're a conglomeration of viewpoints. And I think that really allows people to dehumanize

02:42:41.100 --> 02:42:45.660
the other side. Really, there is no one reading these tweets. Well, you think Jordan Peterson's

02:42:45.660 --> 02:42:52.380
reading these tweets about the incel God thing? Yeah. Is he? I don't know. I think he is. I think

02:42:52.380 --> 02:42:56.860
Jordan spends, I would love Jordan spend less time on Twitter. Okay. I think that would be,

02:42:56.860 --> 02:43:03.260
I think that that would be good. But even if they're not, there is a person there that is the

02:43:03.260 --> 02:43:10.060
representation of the person. And I don't know, like saying something to somebody online that you

02:43:10.060 --> 02:43:16.300
wouldn't say to their face, to me seems like a coward's way of communicating. Or you view it as an

02:43:16.300 --> 02:43:21.500
adaptive landscape, which is new exploits have been created. I mean, if I explained to you a

02:43:21.500 --> 02:43:25.820
mosquito life cycle, okay, you're going to find somebody with excess blood, and you're going to

02:43:25.820 --> 02:43:30.140
steal some for yourself. That's my video guy who's been eaten alive since we've been in LA.

02:43:30.300 --> 02:43:35.580
Is that right? Yeah. Okay. But you see the same cookie cutter sharks do the same thing for large

02:43:36.220 --> 02:43:43.180
marine wildlife. They'll just take a plug of flesh out. It's like, can't afford to go after

02:43:43.180 --> 02:43:49.180
cookie cutter sharks. When you have those kinds of strategies, am I going to sit around in the

02:43:49.180 --> 02:43:54.540
ocean and say, no, that's not a legitimate strategy. You're a parasite. It's like, yeah.

02:43:55.420 --> 02:43:58.940
Like that's my whole game where I'm a predator. I just murder things for a living.

02:43:59.900 --> 02:44:04.780
It's really what predation is about. And in a certain sense, what you've done is you've changed

02:44:04.780 --> 02:44:12.060
the adaptive landscape. And these are the new exploits. Yes. So to get back to the video games,

02:44:12.060 --> 02:44:17.020
porn and social media, Diana Fleischman has this idea she calls uncanny volvers.

02:44:18.060 --> 02:44:23.740
Tell me more. She says that porn has been able to hijack the mate seeking behavior specifically of

02:44:23.740 --> 02:44:32.700
men by giving them a very titrated dose of what it is that they would usually get. Which means that

02:44:36.380 --> 02:44:41.580
part of that motivation to go out and do the risk taking behavior has been tuned down.

02:44:41.580 --> 02:44:47.020
But what do you get from video games? You get camaraderie. You get progressive overload in

02:44:47.020 --> 02:44:53.500
terms of your achievements. You get a sense of belonging. You get a dopamine when you achieve

02:44:53.500 --> 02:44:56.940
something. You may even get some serotonin because you feel like you're lumped together with your

02:44:56.940 --> 02:45:01.500
group of friends. Okay. And then once you get on social media, with social media, we've gamified

02:45:01.500 --> 02:45:05.500
the status hierarchy. It's there. There's a number right in front of you. And there are

02:45:05.500 --> 02:45:09.100
levels that you can get to. There's your silver plaque on YouTube. There's your gold plaque.

02:45:09.100 --> 02:45:13.500
There's your blue tick. Look who followed me today. Elon Musk followed me today.

02:45:13.500 --> 02:45:21.500
Whatever. I got a retweet from Paul Graham. It has been able to, and I don't necessarily think

02:45:21.500 --> 02:45:26.220
that this was by design. It could be by side effect. It has been able to specifically for men,

02:45:26.220 --> 02:45:34.940
maybe also for women, give a titrated dose of most of the key drivers that got people out of the

02:45:34.940 --> 02:45:43.100
house to go and do things. Scott Galloway trended earlier on for saying that unless you're asleep

02:45:43.100 --> 02:45:47.660
as a young person, you shouldn't be in the house. And his point is life is for living.

02:45:47.660 --> 02:45:53.980
There is lots for you to learn outside. Fuck off. Go out. Come on. And he got tons and tons of

02:45:53.980 --> 02:46:02.540
pushback. And maybe he's wrong. But when I get advice, sometimes on Q&As, people will say,

02:46:03.100 --> 02:46:07.980
young guys and girls will message and say, I'm 13. And I love your podcast. Like, what the

02:46:08.780 --> 02:46:13.260
fuck? Fantastic. You are in a growth period that is unbelievable. And the people that you're

02:46:13.260 --> 02:46:17.660
getting exposed to, I wish that I'd had access to at 13. What should I do if I want to improve

02:46:17.660 --> 02:46:22.780
myself? What books should I read? What practices should I do? I don't mean to be patronizing,

02:46:22.780 --> 02:46:28.300
but just go outside and live life. There is so much low hanging fruit from knowing what it's

02:46:28.300 --> 02:46:32.220
like to have an argument with your friend and having to cycle home with a flat tire.

02:46:32.940 --> 02:46:38.540
Just things. There is so many life experiences that I think you will gain massive amounts,

02:46:39.500 --> 02:46:45.500
huge, huge amounts of benefit from over and above a 2D lesson. So me and my friend George

02:46:45.500 --> 02:46:50.460
have this conception of a 2D lessons and 3D lessons. So a 2D lesson would be reading about

02:46:50.460 --> 02:46:55.580
Warren Buffett's wealth through an autobiography or watching it. A 3D lesson would be hanging out

02:46:55.580 --> 02:47:01.180
with Warren Buffett at his house for an afternoon. And no matter how immersive we try and make learning,

02:47:01.180 --> 02:47:05.980
3D lessons are always going to win because you can't forget them. They're so visceral.

02:47:05.980 --> 02:47:09.740
And in a world where most of our time and increasing proportion of our time is spent online,

02:47:11.100 --> 02:47:16.540
the in-person 3D lessons become more and more and more powerful. So this is my conception of the

02:47:16.540 --> 02:47:29.340
male sedation hypothesis. How do you judge our sperm counts and testosterone over time?

02:47:30.220 --> 02:47:33.180
Yeah. So there's some evidence. Andrew Heumann shared some evidence that although

02:47:33.180 --> 02:47:36.700
sperm counts are decreasing, penis length is increasing, which...

02:47:37.660 --> 02:47:43.660
But that's not... If I recall correctly, and I hesitate to get into...

02:47:43.660 --> 02:47:45.420
Get into your penis literature, Eric. Come on.

02:47:46.220 --> 02:47:51.900
Well, there is some trade-off in various reproductive systems between

02:47:52.780 --> 02:47:58.380
things that we would classically associate with masculinity. So for example, dung beetles have

02:47:59.020 --> 02:48:06.540
weaponry on their head called antlers, giant hook, and their copulatory apparatus and their antler

02:48:06.540 --> 02:48:09.980
is in inverse proportion. It's the gorilla and chimp thing again, right?

02:48:10.700 --> 02:48:15.500
That one of them has lots of testicles and very little penis length and the other one has the

02:48:15.500 --> 02:48:20.940
reverse. So you have a lot of these conserved systems where somehow reproduction says you

02:48:20.940 --> 02:48:25.820
can have this many total resources, but you have to figure out how to budget between various things

02:48:25.820 --> 02:48:33.820
that appear to be strongly masculine. So I think that declining testosterone is a big concern.

02:48:34.780 --> 02:48:41.500
I would say that it certainly contributes to a generalized change in male behavior,

02:48:41.500 --> 02:48:49.740
risk-taking. It is... Talk about, oh, and women that take birth control can impact the local

02:48:49.740 --> 02:48:54.300
ecology of male testosterone by basically making it feel like they're around infertile women when

02:48:54.300 --> 02:48:58.940
they're not, they're just artificially suppressed women. That impacts a man's testosterone level.

02:48:58.940 --> 02:49:04.380
Men that are around weapons, if mean you walked past a table of guns, the testosterone would go up.

02:49:04.380 --> 02:49:07.740
If we walked past, there's a chainsaw over there, so perhaps it's already high, I'm not sure.

02:49:10.940 --> 02:49:12.540
Do I see how many volleys we can get?

02:49:13.980 --> 02:49:23.180
Do football freestyle. The issues of sperm count, the issue of testosterone production,

02:49:23.180 --> 02:49:28.700
I think contributes to this in a large way. What it is that's causing this, is it phthalates in

02:49:28.700 --> 02:49:33.340
the water? Is it women peeing out their birth control and we've got estrogens in the water supply?

02:49:34.620 --> 02:49:39.260
Is it the foods that we're eating? Is it seed oils? Is it the lack of time outside? Is it grounding?

02:49:39.260 --> 02:49:44.940
Is it... There are a whole host of things that are contributing to this, but I started working

02:49:44.940 --> 02:49:49.020
with a blood testing company, MaricHealth, about six months ago, and I had my bloodstone for the

02:49:49.020 --> 02:49:54.300
first time. My testosterone was about 500, and I'm 35, and I was like, it should be higher than

02:49:54.300 --> 02:49:57.900
that, so what should I do? They gave me some lifestyle interventions and some boron that

02:49:57.900 --> 02:50:01.660
frees up free tea from sex hormone binding, globulin and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

02:50:01.660 --> 02:50:05.820
No pharmaceutical interventions, but they gave me a ton of lifestyle ones. I had my bloodstone

02:50:05.820 --> 02:50:14.620
a couple of weeks ago and it was 900. Over the last six months, there's been some minor but

02:50:14.620 --> 02:50:20.300
noticeable changes to my demeanor, one of them being I'm more aggressive. Like my frustrations

02:50:20.300 --> 02:50:27.020
come to the fore more. Love it. And so, I mean, I'm dying to ask, are you, first of all, are you

02:50:27.020 --> 02:50:35.260
married? No, in a relationship. In a relationship. Do you find that women, heterosexual women,

02:50:35.260 --> 02:50:43.100
respond to classical masculinity? I have to be very carefully as I ask, because they certainly

02:50:43.100 --> 02:50:48.540
respond more than they're supposed to, according to modern rules of femininity. But my guess is

02:50:48.540 --> 02:50:56.140
that it's greatly decreased from the market for masculinity in the 60s, let's say. So look,

02:50:57.420 --> 02:51:02.060
again, inter and intersexual dynamics, something I've spent an awful lot of time

02:51:02.620 --> 02:51:05.980
learning about. I'm writing a book at the moment with David Busse, evolutionary psychologist,

02:51:06.860 --> 02:51:19.820
on this. In the early 2010s, after the success of 50 Shades of Grey, there was a proliferation

02:51:19.820 --> 02:51:28.140
of dark romance novels. And they, there was a pushback from the feminism movement,

02:51:28.860 --> 02:51:35.900
saying that the portrayals of men as dominant, masculine, bearded, big chested, in a loincloth

02:51:35.900 --> 02:51:42.300
or a plaid shirt, wielding an axe, wasn't what women wanted. They wanted a softer, more like the

02:51:42.300 --> 02:51:47.740
brawny guy or the Marlboro man. Correct. They wanted a softer version of this. So they started

02:51:47.740 --> 02:51:52.860
putting more agreeable, more feminized men on the front cover of books. They didn't sell.

02:51:53.580 --> 02:51:57.580
Right. But I wouldn't guess that either of those would be where modern women's heads would be at

02:51:57.580 --> 02:52:02.460
now. In the space of 10 years. So I think that there's, there's, there's massively a difference

02:52:02.460 --> 02:52:06.860
between stated and revealed preferences. Sure. Right. And also to, you know, to caveat that,

02:52:06.860 --> 02:52:10.060
the thing that you may sexually fantasize about is not necessarily what you want to get into a

02:52:10.060 --> 02:52:16.780
relationship with. Guys will say. Say more. That what you optimize for in a one night stand and

02:52:16.780 --> 02:52:19.740
what you optimize for in a marriage partner aren't always necessarily the same thing.

02:52:19.740 --> 02:52:23.980
I would think they would be wildly disparate. Correct. Which means that the front cover of

02:52:23.980 --> 02:52:28.220
the romance novel is not necessarily the partner that you want long term. They're the one that

02:52:28.220 --> 02:52:35.020
you want to fantasize about. Most of these stories are driven by sex rather than driven by love.

02:52:36.300 --> 02:52:40.460
So I have this hypothesis and I wonder if you, you have names for all sorts of things that

02:52:41.020 --> 02:52:46.460
before you give me, I just need to bunch this up. Your acronym, your ponchant for acronym acronyms.

02:52:46.460 --> 02:52:51.500
Yeah. And a friend, Mary says meme first, explain later. And I think that

02:52:51.900 --> 02:52:58.220
some of my favorite episodes, they rely on aphorisms. They rely on creating memes. Sure.

02:52:58.220 --> 02:53:02.940
Small, quippy razors and so on and so forth. First off, because it makes it easy to remember.

02:53:02.940 --> 02:53:06.860
But secondly, because that's what gets the hooks into you. This is how you make things.

02:53:06.860 --> 02:53:11.020
So if you are somebody that's listening that has an idea that really loves that idea,

02:53:11.660 --> 02:53:15.340
give it a name. Give it a name and give it a cool name. Yeah. I came up with fame

02:53:15.340 --> 02:53:20.940
seesaw the other day, which is that on your way up, people want to support you because you remind

02:53:20.940 --> 02:53:24.060
them of their dreams. When you're at the top, they tear you down because you remind them of

02:53:24.060 --> 02:53:29.020
what they gave up on. Yeah. Fame seesaw. Beautiful. And even if it's fucking wrong,

02:53:29.020 --> 02:53:38.620
you can't forget it. So it's good. Very nice. You were saying that when women, when heterosexual

02:53:38.620 --> 02:53:44.300
women realize that they have several possible life cycles and they don't have a clear sense of which

02:53:44.300 --> 02:53:50.140
one they will actually live. Am I going to get married and raise children and be at home with

02:53:50.140 --> 02:53:55.980
the children? Am I going to get married and have one child, maybe two, and be a career person?

02:53:55.980 --> 02:54:00.940
Am I never going to couple, but have children? Am I going to have no children whatsoever?

02:54:00.940 --> 02:54:03.500
Am I going to do that in a coupled situation? Yeah. Yeah.

02:54:05.180 --> 02:54:09.900
Their decision trees blow out as to what it is that they're actually looking for.

02:54:10.140 --> 02:54:19.900
And one of my strong senses is that women encountered something they weren't expecting,

02:54:20.460 --> 02:54:24.940
which is that they might even be smarter than the guy at work who they're competing with,

02:54:25.660 --> 02:54:32.540
but he's happy to come in all of Saturday, all of Sunday, and work hours that are completely

02:54:32.540 --> 02:54:37.660
psychotic. And so then the idea, well, we need work-life balance. We don't want people coming

02:54:37.660 --> 02:54:42.140
in on Friday and Saturday because that's sort of an unfair advantage that somebody who wants a

02:54:42.140 --> 02:54:48.700
healthy life is different from somebody who wants an extreme life. And so now you have this problem,

02:54:48.700 --> 02:54:53.900
which is I'm attracted to the sort of man I wouldn't want to compete with at work.

02:54:55.260 --> 02:55:00.060
If I'm going to be in the office, I want to know that I'm not going to have to deal with the guy

02:55:00.060 --> 02:55:04.700
who's willing to give up every weekend and work hours that I'm unwilling to work because that's

02:55:04.700 --> 02:55:15.980
not how I'm set at the factory versus I want that guy as the go-getter while I'm pregnant and

02:55:15.980 --> 02:55:22.700
incapacitated and raising children to make sure that not only he can shepherd our family through

02:55:22.700 --> 02:55:27.980
anything because he's highly capable, but can also get me back into the workforce when I'm done raising

02:55:27.980 --> 02:55:39.020
children. And this is somewhat what I believe is responsible for the sort of incoherent messages

02:55:39.020 --> 02:55:43.820
that men and women are sending to each other is that when we don't know what life cycle we are

02:55:43.820 --> 02:55:50.780
going to be inhabiting, our eroticism and our romance and our desire is unstable.

02:55:50.860 --> 02:55:59.340
One of the most uncomfortable correlations that I've found over the last few years is that as

02:56:00.300 --> 02:56:05.420
gender inequality, pay inequality between the gender's increases, relationship satisfaction

02:56:05.420 --> 02:56:11.260
for both men and women increases as well. Sorry, decreases. The more egalitarian,

02:56:11.260 --> 02:56:18.380
the more equal the pay, the less satisfied both sexes are with relationships. Men who are in

02:56:18.380 --> 02:56:22.060
relationships where the woman is the primary breadwinner are 50% more likely to use a rectile

02:56:22.060 --> 02:56:29.260
dysfunction medication, where a woman is contributing more than 70% of the household

02:56:29.260 --> 02:56:36.380
income, the marriage is twice as likely to end in divorce. Women for a man, sorry, for a

02:56:38.620 --> 02:56:43.420
woman to move herself the same distance on a 10-point scale in terms of attractiveness

02:56:43.420 --> 02:56:50.700
that a man can by increasing his income by $100,000, she would need a 10,000 times increase

02:56:50.700 --> 02:56:57.020
in income. In short, women are interested socioeconomically in the status of their partner

02:56:57.020 --> 02:57:00.780
in a way that men aren't. Now, the problem that you have is that women now have access

02:57:00.780 --> 02:57:04.220
to education and employment in a way that they never have done before, so they're no longer

02:57:04.220 --> 02:57:09.740
financially dependent on men. Sure, but you're seeing something which is particularly heartbreaking

02:57:09.820 --> 02:57:16.700
in my group of females, which would be women in their mid to late 50s. I have to be honest,

02:57:16.700 --> 02:57:25.340
I've seen some of the women I was most impressed by never coupling. When you talk to them,

02:57:25.340 --> 02:57:29.980
there's some very uncomfortable things that get said, one of which was I was looking for a man

02:57:29.980 --> 02:57:37.740
I could look up to and the pool was just so small. You're thinking, well, okay, it's illegal to say

02:57:37.740 --> 02:57:42.940
I'm looking for a man that I could look up to because that's not in accordance with modern

02:57:42.940 --> 02:57:51.020
feminism and egalitarianism. On the other hand, this idea that when you're one of the world's

02:57:51.020 --> 02:57:57.980
leading chemists or something, there's just not that many men that are going to be in that position.

02:57:57.980 --> 02:58:02.700
I got another meme for you. I got in a lot of trouble for this. It's called the tall girl

02:58:02.700 --> 02:58:07.180
problem. If you stand atop your own status hierarchy, it's very difficult to find somebody

02:58:07.180 --> 02:58:11.020
else across and above from yours. If you're a six foot one girl without heels, you're looking

02:58:11.020 --> 02:58:16.540
at professional athletes and two women for every one man completing a four year US college degree

02:58:16.540 --> 02:58:22.700
by 2030. Between the ages of 21 and 29, women earn 1,111 pounds more on average than their male

02:58:22.700 --> 02:58:27.980
counterparts. But women still have this vestigial attraction to the man who is across and above

02:58:27.980 --> 02:58:33.740
from them. That's hypergamy. This means that as you rise up through your own dominance hierarchy,

02:58:33.740 --> 02:58:38.860
it amounts to a opportunity of diminishing returns. Then why are we not allowed to build

02:58:38.860 --> 02:58:48.700
better men? This is this thing that just floors me. I'm now, through being a father, looking at

02:58:51.020 --> 02:58:59.660
the subset of young men who are absolutely looking to crush it. The advice they're being given is

02:58:59.740 --> 02:59:09.980
so horrific. What like? Well, that doesn't seem mentally healthy. I think it's much better for

02:59:09.980 --> 02:59:16.780
you to enjoy this time with everyone else. It's just like watering down raw ambition.

02:59:17.660 --> 02:59:27.740
Is it ludicrous who said, get out of the way? Get out of the way of these people.

02:59:28.460 --> 02:59:35.180
These people want to invest and blow your socks off and just do amazing things. There's some

02:59:35.180 --> 02:59:42.300
administrator or nanny or nurse ratchet who's like, well, that would be arrogant. We can't have that.

02:59:43.260 --> 02:59:51.020
You're saying, I don't think you understand it, but ambition is a necessary input for certain

02:59:51.020 --> 02:59:56.060
humans. If you sit there and say, why do you have a right to innovate when nobody else has

02:59:56.060 --> 03:00:04.140
innovated? Don't you realize that your go-getter personality during the COVID situation was based

03:00:04.140 --> 03:00:09.340
on your privilege? In fact, a lot of other people are suffering from mental health. You're just

03:00:09.340 --> 03:00:16.300
thinking, why am I taking the most promising people and tying them to the most damaged people?

03:00:16.300 --> 03:00:22.620
Why not instead take the most promising people and have them get a PhD by the age of 2021

03:00:22.620 --> 03:00:26.460
and study what to do for their fellow souls who are struggling?

03:00:27.660 --> 03:00:31.500
Do you remember when Elon took over Twitter and he started to rip out the tech team?

03:00:33.180 --> 03:00:37.740
He said, I want to make Twitter a place where the people who want to work the hardest on the

03:00:37.740 --> 03:00:45.740
biggest problems can come and work. People said, they looked at that and said, this is going back

03:00:45.740 --> 03:00:50.460
to an archaic form of Silicon Valley where people are forced to sleep under desks and it's a blah,

03:00:52.620 --> 03:00:58.140
those people do not have theory of mind to understand what it's like to be someone as driven

03:00:59.020 --> 03:01:03.900
as it takes to look at that from Elon, not as modern-day slavery.

03:01:04.860 --> 03:01:09.500
No, he was saying, it can be modern-day slavery or it could be the person saying,

03:01:09.500 --> 03:01:14.220
for God's sakes, I'm burning to solve this problem. Let me go. Let me sleep under my desk.

03:01:16.220 --> 03:01:21.100
Unhook the leash and let me go at this. There is a cohort of people out there for whom

03:01:21.100 --> 03:01:23.900
that's their calling. They didn't want to work at Twitter if they got

03:01:24.860 --> 03:01:29.580
frappuccinos and mindful Monday afternoons off and to be able to play ping-pong for half the

03:01:29.980 --> 03:01:35.340
whatever it was that was going on. They want to go and they want to feel like they're contributing

03:01:35.340 --> 03:01:43.180
to an astronomically-sized goal, an unreasonable goal, and they want to feel the rush of going

03:01:43.180 --> 03:01:51.580
toward it. I think you're right. I think that there is a dampening of ambition. Since being in

03:01:51.580 --> 03:01:57.740
America, since moving to America 18 months ago, the fuel that I've had from the enthusiasm from

03:01:57.740 --> 03:02:03.580
the people I've been around has fueled me and powered me in a way that I wasn't, it was alien.

03:02:03.580 --> 03:02:12.700
I was 33 years old and I'd never felt it before. There's so much to do and it requires ambitious

03:02:12.700 --> 03:02:18.780
people. Those people have to be both arrogant and humble. It's a complicated thing. It involves

03:02:18.780 --> 03:02:27.900
mentorship. I want to say also something about elitism. Elitism is incredibly unfair.

03:02:30.380 --> 03:02:35.500
I've hung out with Stanley Jordan and I am never going to play any instrument the way

03:02:35.500 --> 03:02:42.140
Stanley Jordan plays the guitar. He's an elite object. I am not going to be that guy. You have

03:02:42.140 --> 03:02:48.780
to learn how to let elite people do elite things where you can't compete with them.

03:02:51.100 --> 03:02:56.700
I don't know what to do about this. The idea that we're turning against the concept of elite,

03:02:56.700 --> 03:03:01.500
because we've got this pretend elite that sits in these chairs that screws everything up,

03:03:02.540 --> 03:03:08.940
and you've got all of these ambitious people who are being destroyed by enforced helplessness.

03:03:09.820 --> 03:03:17.180
How do we fire the administrators necessary to return universities to being universities?

03:03:18.620 --> 03:03:29.100
How do we explain that some people are built to fly wingsuits? It's a super dangerous activity,

03:03:30.460 --> 03:03:37.980
but somebody needs that rush or they're not alive. People need danger. They need risk.

03:03:37.980 --> 03:03:44.540
They need to be able to create. They don't need you in their way all the time. I have this very

03:03:44.540 --> 03:03:52.220
strong sense that school has become the most dangerous place that we're pushing so many

03:03:52.220 --> 03:04:02.620
people through school. School is basically destroying vitality. By the time you get

03:04:02.620 --> 03:04:08.220
through this education that is so laden with administrators and people telling you things

03:04:08.220 --> 03:04:16.380
that are wrong, I don't know how to say this, but when a friend of mine gets a call as a

03:04:16.380 --> 03:04:22.460
chaired professor in a technical discipline from a dean who says, we have a little bit of a problem

03:04:22.460 --> 03:04:27.740
with some of your current tweets. What did I say? It's not what you said, but it's that you liked

03:04:27.740 --> 03:04:34.700
somebody else's tweets and you're thinking, I don't care who you are. You'd never talk to a

03:04:34.700 --> 03:04:41.420
professor like that. You cannot have these people. We need the University of Chicago

03:04:41.420 --> 03:04:48.140
to spread its middle finger across the country and get rid of these people.

03:04:48.940 --> 03:04:57.900
You can't talk to them. They're a plague from hell on thought.

03:05:00.620 --> 03:05:10.300
You can't tax all thought by making it nice. Something I really don't know how to communicate,

03:05:10.300 --> 03:05:13.900
but I saw you got Sam Harris a certain amount of trouble, so maybe I'll buy a little bit of

03:05:13.900 --> 03:05:24.060
trouble for myself. You can't have terrible ideas circulating everywhere,

03:05:25.180 --> 03:05:31.500
leading to pogroms and riots and killings. I was just in Istanbul, maybe my favorite

03:05:31.500 --> 03:05:39.260
city on earth, and I was reminded of the Turkish Kristallnacht that happened in the Beolu

03:05:40.220 --> 03:05:45.820
Karakoy area of Istanbul where there was a rumor about the desecration, I think,

03:05:45.820 --> 03:05:52.060
of the birthplace of Adatürk. People died as a result, and ethnic minorities could not be

03:05:52.060 --> 03:05:59.740
protected. You cannot allow free speech to circulate every dumb idea infinitely until

03:05:59.740 --> 03:06:08.140
people are killed in pogroms or holocausts or whatever. You've got two options. You either

03:06:08.620 --> 03:06:14.780
constrain speech by rules or by culture. This is the reason that I was so against

03:06:14.780 --> 03:06:22.940
Myloyanopoulos. You want a culture in which everyone is allowed to burn the flag and it

03:06:22.940 --> 03:06:28.380
doesn't even occur to you that that's something you would want to do. That's culture. You've

03:06:28.380 --> 03:06:36.460
got to load the inhibiting factor on culture. People say, well, that's what cancellation is

03:06:36.460 --> 03:06:41.340
about. It's like, well, but if you misuse the concept of shunning, let's call it by something

03:06:41.340 --> 03:06:48.700
older than cancellation. If you shun people for good questions, if you shun people for

03:06:49.580 --> 03:06:54.860
speaking truthfully and decently as if they had done something horrible, then you lose the ability

03:06:54.860 --> 03:07:00.940
to control bad behavior through social norms. One of the things that I've now come to understand is

03:07:01.580 --> 03:07:08.860
we are either going to restore a culture which shuns only when shunning is really the correct

03:07:08.860 --> 03:07:14.140
course of action, or we are going to have rules that prohibit what you can and cannot say. I am

03:07:14.140 --> 03:07:19.660
absolute in that we should not have rules. We've got to put this on culture and we've got to get

03:07:19.660 --> 03:07:25.180
a culture in which, in general, you are very careful about the negative things that you say.

03:07:25.900 --> 03:07:31.580
One of the things that Milo did that I really disliked was he said, well,

03:07:32.380 --> 03:07:37.100
the purpose of free speech is to protect outrageous speech. The answer is not really.

03:07:38.460 --> 03:07:43.260
Yes, if I'm forced to stand up for your right to say horrible things, I can do that if the

03:07:43.260 --> 03:07:47.820
culture generally retards horrible things. If the culture now starts to encourage it,

03:07:47.980 --> 03:07:56.780
we can't have terrible ideas being the precursor of communal violence, let's say.

03:07:58.780 --> 03:08:03.820
We really shouldn't be having rules determine what we can and can't say. It should be that

03:08:03.820 --> 03:08:09.020
when somebody starts to say something that is the beginning of an incitement to madness,

03:08:09.900 --> 03:08:15.500
that the cultural prohibition against that is very strong. In my recent travels,

03:08:15.500 --> 03:08:21.740
I've been shocked. I've been in Bombay, I've been in Istanbul, I've been in Lisbon, Porto,

03:08:23.500 --> 03:08:29.660
in the islands of the Azores. None of these cities has fallen as far as San Francisco.

03:08:31.500 --> 03:08:39.820
Bombay is madness, but we don't have a homelessness problem in San Francisco. We have a zombie

03:08:39.820 --> 03:08:46.540
apocalypse problem. We have a dysfunctional government problem. When you can't say we

03:08:46.540 --> 03:08:53.020
cannot have this in Union Square, we just can't. We cannot have a zombie apocalypse in Union Square.

03:08:53.020 --> 03:08:58.540
When that becomes controversial in and of itself, you've lost the plot. And partially,

03:08:58.540 --> 03:09:04.540
what's happened is that we've given up on high trust societies where we more or less share

03:09:04.540 --> 03:09:11.900
each other's values. That's the concept of the loyal opposition. We both know what the goal is.

03:09:11.900 --> 03:09:15.740
You have an idea of how to get there. I have a different idea. I agree that we're going to have

03:09:15.740 --> 03:09:20.140
a contest and one of us will win and one of us will begrudgingly go along with the other person's

03:09:20.140 --> 03:09:27.580
idea. When your idea about what a just society is, well, let's vindictively punish successful

03:09:27.580 --> 03:09:31.580
people. Let's pretend that male and female have no difference or all the difference according to

03:09:31.580 --> 03:09:38.860
some set of rules on alternate Tuesdays. Let's decide that we can redefine what a recession is

03:09:38.860 --> 03:09:44.460
or the consumer price index. Let's decide that we don't need masks. Yes, we do. No, we don't. Yes,

03:09:44.460 --> 03:09:52.780
we do because of the science, science, science. Can somebody get rid of these people? We need

03:09:52.780 --> 03:10:03.660
to be in a society that makes some semblance of sense. We cannot go in these opposite directions.

03:10:03.660 --> 03:10:09.260
As far as I'm concerned, when you say, we don't want no more police, you and I cannot be the

03:10:09.260 --> 03:10:18.220
loyal opposition to each other. You're not the kind of a person I even understand. Somehow,

03:10:18.220 --> 03:10:23.820
that idea got into your head and it made sense to you. It's now carrying the day.

03:10:26.780 --> 03:10:33.740
I have always supported some amount of reasonable gun control. I changed on a dime with that

03:10:34.380 --> 03:10:37.660
abolish the police. We don't want no more police to fund the police.

03:10:39.340 --> 03:10:44.140
Are you telling me that people are not going to be allowed to own a weapon and you're going to get

03:10:44.140 --> 03:10:48.620
rid of the thing that was supposed to centralize the violence on behalf of the state and make it

03:10:48.620 --> 03:10:54.140
follow rules? There's no coming back from that. I think that one of the things that we just have

03:10:54.140 --> 03:10:59.420
to learn is that many of the voices that we've been listening to because they got jobs in our

03:10:59.420 --> 03:11:05.180
organs, whether it was the New Yorker or the Washington Post or a professorship at Duke,

03:11:06.060 --> 03:11:11.260
we have to stop listening to these people wholesale. We have to stop being tolerant

03:11:11.260 --> 03:11:17.820
of the intolerant. If you come from a position that is sufficiently extreme and your whole point

03:11:17.820 --> 03:11:24.540
is to try to use and weaponize democracy, to weaponize free speech, to weaponize good faith,

03:11:24.540 --> 03:11:32.540
to weaponize what it means to hold a debate, you need to not really have a voice at the table

03:11:33.180 --> 03:11:39.980
because we don't have a solution. If you say that I am entitled to sit at this table as a

03:11:39.980 --> 03:11:44.620
member of the suicide bombing community strapped with a vest filled with high explosives,

03:11:45.420 --> 03:11:50.220
the presence of C4 in your vest invalidates you being at that table that's trying to come up

03:11:50.220 --> 03:11:55.500
with a solution. If you say fundamentally, I don't believe that we should be having children

03:11:55.500 --> 03:12:01.180
because humans are evil and we need to bring this all to a close, it's very important that you not

03:12:01.180 --> 03:12:10.940
be on the city council because that city is a generational endowment and you hand it to the

03:12:10.940 --> 03:12:16.620
next generation and eventually you don't live there anymore. We are somehow seating people who

03:12:16.620 --> 03:12:23.980
are so nihilistic and so freakishly divorced from anything that we should be able to assume as a

03:12:23.980 --> 03:12:31.820
default. Certain positions that probably had 10 adherents appear to have millions of adherents

03:12:32.540 --> 03:12:40.220
and if we don't get rid of these self-extinguishing theories, we are going to self-extinguish,

03:12:40.220 --> 03:12:47.980
so I believe that civil society has an obligation to stop listening to positions that are avowedly

03:12:48.060 --> 03:12:54.380
self-extinguishing. Eric Weinstein, ladies and gentlemen, Eric, I really appreciate you.

03:12:54.380 --> 03:12:59.580
What's next? What can people expect from you? Have you got anything interesting coming up?

03:13:01.500 --> 03:13:08.860
More than anything, remember that the whole point is when you see a person with a shirt that says

03:13:08.860 --> 03:13:14.780
there is no planet B, look at the night sky and remember that the only way to get to planet B

03:13:14.780 --> 03:13:19.820
is to change what we understand about physics and so look for me on that front.

03:13:20.620 --> 03:13:21.820
Thank you. Cheers, mate.

03:13:21.820 --> 03:13:22.700
Thanks. Be well.

03:13:23.500 --> 03:13:27.180
Thank you very much for tuning in. If you enjoyed that episode with Eric,

03:13:27.180 --> 03:13:35.660
you will love this one with Jordan Peterson. Go on. Press it.
