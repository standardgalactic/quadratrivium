16680	37400	Daniel I I'm very impressed that we finally managed to get this recording sorted not only between time difference challenges or me needing to rearrange or a global pandemic were finally here we finally got each other on the line.
38360	63740	Yeah the global pandemics fuck up our schedule sometimes it's very inconvenient yeah it's incredibly inconvenient you know I'm so as you're aware we talk a lot on this podcast about self development and you help people to make sense of the world sense making preventing global catastrophic risks so in light of the way that the world is at the moment.
64580	78140	What are your thoughts about how people can develop themselves whilst still ensuring that we have a functioning world that isn't isn't risky.
78140	88580	We can go like a million places with that question and so we'll just start and see what happens.
91080	93700	Even the topic of personal development.
94460	104100	What that means is pretty ambiguous the idea of development means that something can progress to some stage of more refinement or more capacity.
105100	121460	And so we know what that means in mathematics or in playing classical piano or weightlifting right there's some sense of progressive development but what does it mean for a person to develop beyond early adulthood we also have a very clear sense that children go through developmental stages.
122300	130140	Of increasing their cognitive and social and linguistic and motor and all these types of capacities but then when does that stop.
131140	142740	Does it have to stop there's a development of more skills but what does becoming a more developed human being fundamentally mean is a philosophic is spiritual religious existential question.
144380	148820	And so the question of what is a meaningful human life is underneath that.
149660	158820	And then how do I effectively develop myself aligned with what is most meaningful.
160340	177900	And when I'm asking what is a meaningful human life there's not just my own experience but how do I relate to the whole of life how does the meaningfulness of life relate to both what I experience and also what I contribute to the experience of others.
179780	194020	And so when we think about the current world situation does the world situation we're in create a context for what kinds of human development are relevant within the general parameters of some universal truths and.
195260	207060	It certainly does because what the world needs if we want to really effectively serve to protect against unnecessary harm and to increase the quality of life it needs different skills that it needed a thousand years ago.
208060	215060	And it needs different it actually needs totally different kinds of minds and sense making in many ways.
216740	223060	And then some aspects of it are obviously going to be the same across lots of contexts like the refinement of our clarity in our own motivation.
225420	229260	And our own emotional resilience and things like that.
230260	243260	I think the motivation is an interesting one to start on which is as soon as you have a concept of human development and there's some concept of more developed and you can conceptually understand that to try and orient yourself.
245260	246260	Then.
247260	254260	There becomes an inherent comparison with other people of are they comprehensively more developed human than I am.
255260	262260	And or am I more than they are and is my thinking that I'm more than they are some sign of ego which is actually a sign of low development.
264260	265260	In some particular way.
266260	274260	And it's easy to cognitively understand what some higher stage of development would express like.
275260	278260	And be able to act it without it actually being real.
279260	291260	And so as soon as there's you know you read David Deiden you have the an authentic man is such and such or a embodied woman is such and such or whatever you can just start acting that.
291260	293260	And having it be totally not real and having.
296260	299260	A bunch of personal development mimicking.
300260	303260	For basically status seeking.
304260	308260	And what's underneath that the status seeking impulse which is usually.
309260	320260	Fundamental insecurities is actually not healing itself which with the real personal development would be it's actually doubling down on itself and building up a presentation package and whether it's I'm rich or I'm buff.
321260	324260	Or I'm enlightened just depends on the subculture you're appealing to.
326260	329260	That is a very hard red pill to swallow.
330260	332260	And I couldn't agree more the.
333260	340260	There's a quote from Ben Bergeron who says that character will always beat strategy is a CrossFit coach.
340260	347260	And I think what he's talking about there is the virtue of doing the thing because it's the thing that you want to do.
348260	360260	From your inner most being as opposed to doing the thing because that's what you think you should do based on what you've been told so that you can then signal that you are a person who has these virtues it's.
361260	362260	Cart horse or horse cart.
365260	366260	When you mention.
367260	368260	Virtue signaling.
369260	379260	Which will obviously show up very differently in different cultures right that I'm a good Republican versus I'm a good Democrat is going to have totally it'll be repulsive to the people of the different tribe.
380260	383260	Or religions or different types of aesthetics.
385260	388260	From an evolutionary biology perspective it's mostly just made signaling.
389260	394260	And so whether it's a hundred and fifty foot super yacht or it's.
397260	407260	You know having read all the books in a particular space and presenting yourself in a way that we say OK well where is that imperative to want people to respond to me in a particular way.
407260	412260	Well it has something to do with power dynamics in a tribe and largely basically.
413260	415260	Mate signaling is the evolutionary origin of it.
416260	418260	It's valuable to just admit that.
419260	421260	And just kind of reflect on it to say.
422260	427260	The more I can reflect on the biological predispositions that arise the less I'm controlled by them.
428260	432260	And I don't want to be ashamed of a repress them or just automatically go with them.
432260	439260	Right because they gave rise to the capacity for abstraction and the abstraction can give rise to higher order interests.
440260	441260	In the base interests.
444260	447260	So this is actually a very valuable thing in personal development.
448260	449260	Is.
452260	456260	Just taking the time to very deeply earnestly inquire into your motive.
456260	459260	And OK I'm wanting to develop in this way why.
460260	464260	Is because mostly the wise are actually lies right.
465260	480260	I believe that when I'm buff then I will dot dot dot and it's and it's not going to be true right so the thing happens and then it's just some other set of goals and.
480260	481260	And so.
483260	488260	Typically whenever someone is going about doing some.
489260	492260	Project to help the world or develop themselves or whatever.
493260	495260	They usually have mixed motives.
495260	497260	They have like a dozen different motives driving them.
498260	500260	And they're usually only aware of half of them.
501260	503260	And they'll usually only admit like one or two of them.
506260	507260	And.
508260	515260	And but this will affect your results and your trustworthiness because those motives will pull in different ways.
516260	518260	And so let's say.
519260	525260	I'm trying to develop myself as someone who's more capable of making a difference in the world and so I'm doing some alleviating poverty project.
526260	532260	And the mission statement of why we're doing this is because these kids don't have shoes and they don't have food and we need to bring it to them and we care.
533260	546260	That might actually be true like I might actually care as one of the 12 or so motives that has me doing that I might also need to make some money in this nonprofit is a way that I can make some money I also might want to.
552260	559260	Feel successful in a different way and this hits a certain idea of what will make me feel successful.
560260	563260	And then there might be a bunch of stuff that's unconscious like.
565260	574260	Insecurity from childhood in school and still wanting to hear that I did a good job that my parents didn't give me or that they did project it on to the rest of the world.
576260	587260	The degree to which you can just really watch that right just watch the things that are rising in the mind and they'll show up when you notice where who you're comparing yourself with and where you feel jealousies.
588260	593260	Which is something that you think that you're wanting that someone else is getting socially or whatever.
594260	599260	And just in reflecting then you can ask yourself the question.
603260	609260	So which of these seem like they're coming from wholeness like from from the deepest wholeness.
609260	617260	The deepest wholeness version of myself I could imagine and which of them feel like they're more coming from insecurity or woundedness.
618260	623260	And if I imagine myself growing in my wholeness which of these would deepen and which would lessen.
624260	630260	And then of the ones that would lessen you can just ask if this wasn't there at all how would my life be different.
631260	635260	Like the desire that people like me or whatever it is just wasn't there at all.
636260	640260	And that doesn't mean to pathologize it just you just get it inquire in that and notice how does it move you.
641260	645260	And maybe some ways that it moves you are fine but it's good to at least be clear on it.
646260	655260	Are those some of the signals that people can use to identify that because the pernicious thing about our subconscious is that we're not conscious of it.
655260	662260	Not without doing a tremendous amount of introspective work time in solitude and all that sort of stuff.
663260	672260	So are there any signals that people can say that's that's that thing manifesting again.
673260	685260	Yeah I mean I think a lot of people if they just make time kind of already know what some of the signals are.
686260	694260	Say there's a project you want to do and you want to do it because it actually feels intrinsically meaningful.
694260	696260	Right there's a real intrinsic motive.
699260	708260	And you think about someone else getting credit for it you're not getting credit for it versus you getting credit for it you just or you even notice in the process of a conversation.
709260	712260	Where there is a credit seeking impulse arising you.
713260	720260	And you say oh that impulse and the impulse to actually serve are not the same impulse those are two different impulses that are both arising.
721260	727260	And then maybe they can be made to be two sled dogs pulling in the same direction but they might be sled dogs pulling in opposite directions.
728260	734260	Because sometimes the way I can serve the project best is to let someone else take credit so they work harder to make the thing happen.
736260	747260	And this is why you know if you read the doubt a chain as a book of leadership almost it just says that thing again and again the best leaders the one that nobody even knows is leading who doesn't want to lead.
748260	752260	Who other people push to lead because they trust them and really just empowers everyone else.
758260	771260	I get it so thinking about what this means for people on a broader scale what it means for an individual to understand their motivations toward leading a good life.
772260	780260	I think one of the key insights that I've had from spending time exposed to this sort of content is that I.
782260	788260	Didn't for a long time and still mostly don't know what I want to want truthfully.
789260	791260	It's a very hard question to answer.
792260	802260	Yeah there's a in processes in the process of development of becoming more self-reflexively aware.
803260	809260	So at first you're living in a particular way and you aren't even really reflecting on if that's the right way to be living right.
810260	815260	And then you start reflecting on you realize oh I'm actually behaving ways that go against the things that I want.
816260	821260	And so I'm getting angry or I'm getting jealous or I'm whatever it is that isn't who I really want to be.
821260	824260	And this is kind of like tier one mimetics and personal development.
824260	826260	Let me see if I can work on changing that.
828260	837260	And some people will start to realize well that pattern of being angry or being habituated or whatever being lazy was conditioned in me.
837260	844260	Because had I grown up with the Sioux Indians or with the Machiganga tribe or whatever I would be different right.
844260	846260	Like there's no question that there would be a lot about me that's different.
846260	855260	So I don't want to just be the kind of default byproduct of how I happen to grow up that I didn't even really have a say in where I chose.
856260	858260	So can I recondition and it's like yeah I can recondition it.
859260	866260	Then there's some more reflection it says so I can recondition my behaviors to be more aligned with what I want and what I value.
867260	869260	They're like fuck what I want what I value was conditioned also.
872260	879260	Because do I want to be a good Christian or I want to be a good Muslim or I want to be a good Hindu or a good scientist.
879260	884260	Do I want to be a Wall Street banker or a good family man.
884260	895260	Do I that was probably also conditioned right all the way down to your your metaphysical framework for what reality is and what the good life is in there.
896260	903260	Now you've entered the heart of existentialism because you're asking what is worth wanting.
905260	909260	And then you have to say well what is the basis to answer that that wasn't just conditioned.
910260	914260	Is there some deeper than my conditioning basis can I pierce through the conditioning.
915260	921260	And so what I'm trying to ask is is there anything intrinsically meaningful about the nature of reality that I can come to understand.
922260	928260	That is beyond where I happen to have been conditioned where regardless of where I would have been conditioned this is something I could come to.
932260	937260	And it turns out that there are meaningful ways to address that.
938260	943260	Tell us that's what we're here for Daniel we are here to to find out about that.
944260	954260	There's different ways of approaching this that have validity so I'm not going to say what the truth of a meaningful life is but I'll say some.
955260	963260	Ways that I have found and that others I have seen have found that are meaningful and also acknowledge you can walk.
964260	966260	One or multiple of these paths.
972260	977260	I forget the author there's a famous quote the heart knows reasons that reason knows nothing of.
978260	987260	And there is a kind of poetic artistic answer to the question which is it just is.
988260	1003260	Right there's a deep there's a sense of this is meaningful because it'll serve this and then that because this and then at a certain level there's a sense of just prima facia it just is and like life.
1004260	1008260	Life is fundamentally meaningful and worth serving why.
1009260	1018260	Just it's right there's no deeper explanation that adds more clarification than that it is based on your own direct experience of.
1019260	1031260	Your experience of a liveness feeling intrinsically meaningful and then you're sensing the depth of other people's experience of life and seeing that that's meaningful in your desire to serve life in that way and it just.
1031260	1039260	And so the answer there is not really a deep philosophical inquiry it's more about a felt experience.
1043260	1044260	That's great.
1045260	1058260	And you know the first verse of the Tao Te Ching is that the knowledge that is knowable is not the eternal knowledge and the Dow that is speakable is not the eternal Dow.
1060260	1068260	Which means the to translate the meaning or the purpose of everything that you can describe in words isn't really it.
1069260	1072260	Because it's fundamentally trans semantic.
1074260	1084260	Semantic is a symbol that has a very finite meaning that is supposed to represent a certain ground right like the word Apple references Apple you know.
1085260	1091260	But when I'm talking about meaningfulness of reality there is no word that can actually hold the ground of everything.
1092260	1098260	And so there can be though a certain kind of felt sense of connectedness with it.
1101260	1113260	Now we can also think about it more and come up with better answers and it's actually nice when we do both of these and there's a confluence of the deepening of our own felt connection and the deepening of the clarity of how we understand it.
1121260	1130260	So some people go to landmark and it starts with well I don't want to say what landmark says.
1133260	1139260	There are some systems that would will say reality is fundamentally meaningless.
1140260	1143260	And that's empowering and beautiful because you get to create the meaning.
1143260	1155260	There isn't some a priori God that said this is how you win the race at the end and either get it right or you get it wrong by some you know predefined definition that can feel empowering.
1158260	1171260	There's actually some kind of metaphysics smuggled in there which is to say you get to create the meaning is still actually holding some concept of meaningfulness and the value on your own creativity.
1172260	1181260	Right so there it's not actually doing the deeper inquiry to say well why do I value choice why do I value creativity and what is the basis for meaningfulness my own assessment.
1185260	1188260	So again those are just in prima facie held as meaningful.
1189260	1212260	So science is a process of trying to come to understand the objective world in a way that goes beyond my own subjective sense of what it is which means beyond my conditioning and my bias right.
1213260	1218260	And so I might think that sound travels faster than light at room temperature and air.
1219260	1236260	So I set up an experiment and measure it and I find out that it just doesn't and then I can do that 100 times or a million times and other people can do it we can use different apparatus and there is a the measurability and the repeatability gives us a certain sense of the objectivity of it right.
1237260	1246260	Well so science has done a very good job of giving us a framework for is what is that is not based on what I think is.
1248260	1265260	It doesn't it hasn't given us the same basis for what ought to be and there is this classic division between science and ethics or science and existentialism and called the is ought distinction science can say what is it can't say what ought because it's not.
1266260	1285260	The process of science is a process of observing and measuring observable things which are inherently third person objects and then being able to find patterns of regularities expressed that I can express in something like math.
1286260	1292260	And so it pertains to the domain of the things that are measurable and repeatable.
1295260	1296260	Our experience isn't measurable.
1297260	1301260	It's feelable it's first person not third person they're fundamentally different categories right.
1302260	1310260	You say well no your measure your experience is measurable because we can measure brain waves it's not measuring the experience that's measuring a brain state that happens to correlate with your felt experience.
1311260	1322260	But someone who studies the neuroscience of EEG is who's looking at the brain pattern of a Zen meditator can look at that and has no idea what the experience is like.
1324260	1336260	And so the fact that there might be some neural correlates to experience doesn't mean you're measuring the experience it means there's some neural correlate right but that's still the domain of third person which is fundamentally never first person.
1337260	1341260	So first person is outside of the domain of science formally.
1343260	1348260	This is important because it says science is not a method of knowing all of reality.
1349260	1355260	It's a method of knowing parts of reality and there's parts of reality that are rigorously outside of the methods of science.
1357260	1361260	But we want something like we had with science which was a better process of knowing.
1362260	1374260	And so are there better processes of knowing about the nature of first person and the nature of the relationship between first person and third person because a meaningful life is going to involve the nature of the world.
1375260	1380260	It's also going to involve the nature of my experience and it's going to involve the relationship between me and the world.
1381260	1389260	Right well that's at least three different ontological categories third person first person and the relationship between the two which is neither third person nor first person.
1391260	1397260	So that requires a more robust philosophy that includes but transcends the philosophy of science.
1400260	1409260	So let's say we just look at a kind of scientific story we can frame this lots of different ways is it a lot of people have.
1410260	1422260	Made a universe story based on a limited part of science and then kind of made a metaphysical story related to it like they'll take the second law of thermodynamics increasing entropy and say OK.
1423260	1432260	So there's a lot of energy at the Big Bang and basically the universe is running down and will eventually turn into just a cold vacuum and die in a big freeze kind of heat death.
1433260	1440260	And so the metaphysics of universe is just this very slow inexorable march towards nothingness.
1442260	1449260	Now if all there was of science was the second law you might do that but that's obviously pretty silly.
1451260	1454260	And there's a lot of things that aren't explained by that at all.
1455260	1467260	And people will take evolutionary biology and talk about make a metaphysical answer that's all about becoming apex predators and dog eat dog kind of stuff and whatever right.
1468260	1473260	That's actually an important one to address because it's still very pernicious worldview.
1474260	1481260	Nature is kind of just cruel and optimizing it.
1482260	1497260	Anyone who spent time in nature and watched predation knows that it's pretty fucking cruel and the things that are the fittest and the fittest can involve effective cruelty survive.
1498260	1518260	And so humans following suit of that being capable of understanding Darwinian kind of process should seek to be as fit as they can be and that that's just being part of the natural order of things.
1519260	1533260	And that's not you know of every species the weak ones dying and getting cold is actually what strengthens the genetics and drives evolution forward so that cruelty the predator usually taking the weak prey out more is actually what's making the prey better.
1534260	1553260	Because they're getting the weak genes out and so then the stronger genes come slightly faster lion that eats the slow gazelle makes getting out gazelle slower over long periods of time so ultimately predatory dynamics violence winning competition is what drives all good things in progress and like that.
1554260	1573260	That's a very classic very narrow idea that takes one very tiny part of science and tries to blow it up to be the meta frame and then interpret it in a way that people wanted to interpret anyways to basically justify shit that was that they wanted to do.
1574260	1596260	I won't say the name, but a couple of people that are amongst the most powerful people in the world in terms of high finance have basically quoted almost all of this to me verbatim in conversations as how they see the world.
1596260	1608260	And, and they said, you know, either like basically apex predators to find the topology of the space.
1608260	1615260	And so either you're the apex predator or somebody else's but the apex predators are going to be the one who runs shit.
1615260	1619260	And if you don't like that you just won't be one of the ones who run shit.
1620260	1632260	One of the guys said pretty directly said, if you all animals are either predators or prey and predators don't feel bad when they kill prey.
1633260	1639260	And if you feel bad when the prey humans die, then you just said what kind of animal you are and that animal doesn't run the world.
1640260	1650260	And the of the predators who don't make it to alpha apex, they also aren't the ones whose genes really go and run the world.
1651260	1655260	And if you don't like the way the alpha apex are, it won't make any difference because they'll still be the ones who run the world.
1655260	1656260	You just won't be part of it.
1658260	1666260	And, you know, this the same conversation went to other places about why the Holocaust was a good thing for Jews.
1667260	1676260	And because they got the state of Israel and nukes and antisemitism became a bad word and etc.
1676260	1679260	Like thinking about, you can see what that worldview does, right?
1679260	1681260	The worldview makes people to think like that.
1685260	1688260	Those conversations wouldn't go to much darker places too.
1688260	1699260	Can I ask, how did you feel hearing those sorts of concepts come from people who not only can imagine it from an armchair philosophy perspective,
1699260	1703260	but actually have the power to be able to wield it in the real world as well?
1703260	1706260	Was that distressing to hear, to sit down opposite somebody and hear that?
1707260	1712260	Yeah, super distressing at first.
1712260	1718260	It was something I didn't have, I didn't have a reference frame for from how I grew up.
1720260	1728260	And that also meant I didn't understand critical things about the world that are important if you actually want to be able to make a difference to things in the world.
1729260	1738260	And so one of the things that I started noticing was how much there are certain psychological dispositions that seek power more than others,
1740260	1749260	and that are also willing to use power in ways that give them more power, including by disempowering everybody else.
1750260	1755260	And that those people have ended up being the people with most power most of the time.
1755260	1757260	What are the most effective?
1757260	1768260	They're the ones that are prepared to go to the places where other people's sense of empathy or virtue or inner compass or whatever it might be would stop them before that.
1769260	1776260	Right, so effective at a specific thing and a specific thing that ends up winning in a natural selection of violence.
1777260	1787260	And so you might have a peaceful culture that is way more effective at producing happy people and producing kind people and living in harmony with the land,
1788260	1793260	but Genghis Khan or Alexander the Great or whatever will come slaughter them and take their space and take their stuff.
1794260	1801260	And so then the means that go on are the means that were effective at winning in a natural selection of warfare.
1802260	1810260	It ends up being that if you that drives an arms race, right, because then somebody becomes better at war,
1811260	1814260	so somebody else has to get those same weapons plus the counter weapons plus better weapons.
1815260	1820260	And eventually you get an exponential curve where it turns into AI-empowered drones and bio weapons and et cetera.
1821260	1824260	And it's actually too big to use any of the weapons safely and you destroy the whole world.
1824260	1833260	And that's why I work on catastrophic risk is the pattern of how we have made it through the local issues is actually what's driving the global issues currently.
1834260	1846260	That kind of rival risk be the apex predator kind of thing at scale is actually destroying the capability for civilization to keep going on period.
1847260	1851260	And so this apex predator thing, we're not apex predators.
1851260	1852260	That's just gibberish.
1853260	1854260	This is a really important thing.
1854260	1855260	I'd like people to understand.
1857260	1859260	An orca is an apex predator, right?
1860260	1861260	Killer whale.
1864260	1869260	Top predator in their environment or polar bear or tiger, right?
1869260	1871260	There's lots of apex predators we could pick.
1872260	1874260	But an orca is like the biggest one you can think of.
1874260	1876260	So they're a good example.
1877260	1881260	An orca can catch one fish at a time, right?
1881260	1885260	It's going to go catch one tuna and it's going to miss most of the time or one seal.
1888260	1903260	It can't take a mile long drift net and pull up 100,000 tuna at once, which we can now with industrialized dredge net kind of fishing.
1904260	1907260	That's not the power of an apex predator, right?
1907260	1913260	A polar bear can kill one walrus at a time and it's fucking dangerous to do that and it's pretty hard to do.
1914260	1919260	It can't slash and burn an acre of forest a second, right?
1919260	1927260	Or be able to do mountaintop removal mining or factory farm whole species of animal and hybridized new species and extinct species.
1928260	1930260	So that's not the power of apex predators.
1930260	1931260	That's the power of gods.
1931260	1932260	We're just shitty gods.
1935260	1945260	If we say, do apex predators have the ability to extinct whole species quickly and destroy whole ecosystems and make new ecosystems and genetically engineer new species?
1945260	1951260	No, that's not something that Darwinian process has anything to do with, right?
1952260	1963260	And so you think about if a polar bear got really pissed and went on a tirade and tried to break all that it could, how much harm could it do compared to Trump or Putin with nukes, right?
1963260	1965260	Like compared to 1F15.
1965260	1975260	So then you say, well, who has the ability to make new species and destroy species and make new environments and destroy them?
1975260	1979260	Well, we've thought of that methodically as the domain of the gods or nature itself.
1979260	1986260	Since we have that much power, we can destroy nature itself, right?
1986260	1998260	And to not do that, we have to be safe vessels for that much power, which means that if you have the power of gods, you have to have the love and the wisdom of gods to guide it and to hold it.
1998260	2006260	And we have developed in our power through technology much, much better than we have developed in our love and wisdom to wield that power well.
2007260	2016260	And we have wielded our power to just how do we use our power to beat the other guys and then they try to develop their power.
2016260	2021260	But that process multiplied by exponential tech destroys everything.
2021260	2034260	And so we are at the brink of a phase shift of either the end of civilization in the not too distant future as we know it, or the emergence into something that is actually worthy of calling civilization, right?
2034260	2048260	That is actually civil that can be able to hold the power of AI and the Internet of Things and geoengineering and bioengineering and actually not fuck everything up with that much capability.
2048260	2055260	There's this very deep question and say, as the power is getting stronger, it's also getting more decentralized, right?
2055260	2065260	So with CRISPR gene drives, you can do the level of bioengineering with a tiny little lab that used to be a whole, you know, the cutting edge of U.S. military, not that many years ago.
2065260	2068260	And the same with drone weaponry and whatever.
2068260	2083260	So we have, you know, during the Cold War, we actually this important thing to understand, until World War II, we didn't have the technological power to destroy everything quickly.
2084260	2086260	As much as we would have wanted to try, we just couldn't.
2086260	2094260	For the hundreds of thousands of years of human history, the most we could want to destroy would still be not that much relative to the planet.
2094260	2104260	And then with the bomb that changed, it's like, oh shit, we can actually make this place not habitable for everybody pretty quickly with just some pushes of buttons.
2104260	2108260	That was the beginning of a whole new world, right?
2108260	2115260	And how do we deal with having creative power that we can't use or we don't exist?
2115260	2125260	And so when we created that, the entire world system had to be recreated just to protect us from using the bomb.
2125260	2136260	The Bretton Woods Convention coming out of World War II was basically a whole new world system where we had to have a united nations because individual national governments clearly didn't prevent World War.
2136260	2145260	And we had to have a World Bank and we had to have a totally new international monetary policy and all of those kinds of structures emerged then.
2145260	2156260	And we had to have mutually assured destruction, which emerged a little bit later, to make sure that neither the US or the Soviets would ever use that power, right?
2156260	2162260	Now, mutually assured destruction was this kind of automated locked on process that if anybody started to fire up there,
2162260	2169260	Nuke silos at the other one, the other ones would automatically go so you couldn't initiate the war without killing yourself and that's what kept everybody from doing it.
2169260	2173260	Mutually assured destruction was what saved us.
2173260	2181260	The system had computer glitches that started to put us into launch sequence many times and we only barely made it in largely by luck.
2181260	2193260	But that's where we only had two superpowers that had that totally catastrophic capability and those two could fully spy on each other to know if the other one was going to do something.
2193260	2202260	And you only had one kind of catastrophe weapon, not lots of them, two superpowers, one kind of catastrophe weapon.
2203260	2206260	And so, mutually assured destruction worked.
2206260	2215260	And we also war when we start running out of resources and then we're competing for the same resources because everybody's greed wants to get more.
2215260	2221260	Their own national development interests or their personal development interests expressed as monetary abundance says,
2221260	2225260	if there's a fixed playing field of stuff, my more has to be your less.
2225260	2228260	Okay, fuck it, war, right?
2228260	2239260	So one of the other things that happened was creating this kind of monetary system coming out of World War II where we could just make up shit tons of new money and debt based finance
2239260	2247260	and be able to create this globalism and just create so much physical abundance of wealth that we didn't have to war, right?
2247260	2250260	Everybody could be getting richer simultaneously.
2250260	2252260	That was the idea.
2253260	2260260	It just happens to be that you're destroying the planet very rapidly doing that by basically taking all of nature and turning it into trash, right?
2260260	2274260	Which is taking ecosystems that took billions of years to develop and unrenewably destroying them on one side and then turning them into pollution on the other side after a very short period of use.
2274260	2281260	And you just don't get to keep doing that for very long on a finite planet before you destroy the planet's ability to let you keep doing that.
2281260	2289260	And also that debt based finance thing starts to catch up with you because in order to pay back the debt, you got to take out more debt.
2289260	2293260	And, you know, so you get this embedded growth obligation, right?
2293260	2300260	You have to keep growing exponentially year over year just to break even because you get to keep up with the interest.
2300260	2308260	So we get to about where we are now and the Bretton Woods world has completely broken down.
2308260	2323260	Because we can't keep just debt based financing rapid growth to prevent conflict because we already have more of our total GDP going to servicing the debt than is sustainable.
2323260	2331260	And so we're at the end of the financial systems ability to do that and COVID just made that worse by lowering GDP and increasing debt a lot.
2331260	2334260	And it was already unsustainable.
2335260	2340260	We're near the planetary boundaries on like 100 different boundaries.
2340260	2349260	And so we can't keep doing the turn nature into trash but money briefly on the way to trash process.
2349260	2354260	And we have dozens of catastrophe weapons now, not just one.
2354260	2361260	And nukes, there's just not that many places that have uranium and it's very hard to enrich and it's not like small groups can really make nukes.
2361260	2363260	They're really hard to make.
2363260	2366260	But that's not true for weaponized drones.
2366260	2368260	They're really easy to make.
2368260	2375260	And for a lot of other new types of exponential tech that relatively small forces, not even state actors can make.
2375260	2380260	Plus there's lots of state actors that have nukes now and chemical weapons and bio weapons and other things like that.
2380260	2387260	So now you're in a world where you've got not two actors but lots of actors, more than we can even identify.
2387260	2398260	Ones that we don't even know who can have catastrophe weapons and not one type of catastrophe weapon but lots of them where you don't have clear counters for them.
2398260	2407260	And you're near the planetary boundaries environmentally and you're at the end of the economic systems capability to keep doing the thing it's done.
2407260	2409260	That's a transition point.
2410260	2429260	And I don't remember exactly how we got here but it's important in understanding this to say that the, oh, I was talking about the Apex Predator model.
2429260	2445260	So that even before we had nukes, an Apex Predator couldn't, doesn't make something like a city, right, which is a completely altered environment.
2445260	2448260	And we've been doing that for thousands of years.
2448260	2455260	But, and we've been using that increased power destructively and driving this arms race of increasing destructive capacity.
2456260	2460260	But at a certain point it became globally catastrophic destruction.
2460260	2468260	And now it's many, many different methods of globally catastrophic destruction initiatable by many, many actors.
2472260	2478260	And so this is now where we're like, oh, this is what the power of God's without the love or wisdom to guide it looks like.
2479260	2486260	And so you could ask this question as exponential tech continues and we get more power that becomes more decentralized.
2486260	2492260	Oh, yeah, it said all that, say nukes are pretty centralized, but the new tech is decentralized, but catastrophic.
2494260	2504260	How do we make a civilization that is antifragile with decentralized exponential technology?
2505260	2514260	Which means if I've got lots of non-state actors that can make catastrophe weapons and I don't even know who they are,
2515260	2521260	how do we make a world that doesn't break given the way that humans have historically used power?
2521260	2525260	How do we make a world where anybody can have the power to break everything?
2527260	2529260	That's an interesting question.
2530260	2531260	It's a very interesting question.
2531260	2541260	It doesn't surprise me that we are in a situation where we face challenges when we consider the intro to this discussion,
2541260	2553260	which was our evolutionary predispositions, our socialized values that we consider to be worth pursuing,
2553260	2558260	which are essentially repurposed versions of a genetic heritage and all this sort of stuff.
2558260	2565260	It doesn't surprise me with the most shaky foundation ever,
2565260	2575260	that when you start to add an awful lot of weight in the form of power, destructive power, technological power,
2575260	2579260	when you start to add that on top that the system becomes incredibly unstable,
2579260	2584260	I wonder whether because I consider myself to be a good person, I'm not perfect,
2584260	2587260	but I don't plan on blowing up the world, right?
2587260	2590260	I don't want to go out and hurt people, I don't want to go out and kill people.
2590260	2596260	For me, I think the idealist inside of me relating to self-development thinks,
2596260	2603260	well, if everybody becomes more self-aware, is able to iterate their introspection
2603260	2608260	and slowly become better over time, go to bed less stupid than when they woke up,
2609260	2614260	naturally out of that system, you wouldn't have any of the pathologies emerge,
2614260	2618260	you wouldn't have any of the challenges emerge because every individual agent within the system
2618260	2624260	would understand genuinely what is best for them, genuinely how to deploy that
2624260	2630260	and also would be using any spare capacity that they have to then help others to understand that
2630260	2634260	and then further progress their movement forward.
2634260	2638260	Aubrey Marcus on the show said, you do not serve others from your cup,
2638260	2641260	you serve others from the saucer that overflows around your cup
2641260	2644260	and what that means is you've got to sort your shit first
2644260	2648260	and then what you have as a surplus you use to help others sort their shit,
2648260	2654260	that's how I saw that and I wonder whether that's naivety, ignorance,
2654260	2659260	probably definitely a lot of ignorance, I've never been exposed to someone
2659260	2663260	who has been able to wield the sort of power of the people that you mentioned
2663260	2666260	and also have that mindset.
2668260	2673260	So probably some ignorance there that I just haven't seen this first hand
2673260	2678260	and it just sounds like a Hollywood movie to hear that happen, right?
2678260	2680260	It just sounds totally detached from me.
2680260	2684260	Yeah, Daniel met a guy but they don't really exist, do they?
2684260	2687260	You're like, no, these are actual people.
2688260	2691260	And yeah, I wonder how much of it is...
2693260	2697260	I wonder how much introspective work, self-development,
2697260	2700260	working out what do you want to want, what should I want to want,
2700260	2705260	what is genuinely good for me and then how can I make what is good for me be good for others.
2705260	2711260	I wonder how much of that can be the answer to some of these challenges that we face
2711260	2716260	and where the upper bound to what that can achieve is.
2718260	2724260	The body isn't just 70 or 90 trillion healthy cells all doing their own thing.
2726260	2729260	That would just be a pile of goo, right?
2729260	2731260	That would just be bioprotoplasm.
2732260	2735260	The body is actually a coordination between those.
2735260	2738260	It involves not just how they function individually in a Petri dish,
2738260	2742260	but how they relate with each other to be able to make tissues and organs and organ systems
2742260	2744260	and that whole thing, right?
2745260	2750260	And so a cell needs to do what it needs to do to be a healthy cell,
2750260	2755260	but it also needs to communicate with all the ones around it to mediate what the tissue needs to do.
2757260	2760260	Because it can't just be doing its own thing when the muscle needs to flex.
2760260	2764260	That particular muscle cell has to be engaged in the process, right?
2765260	2769260	And let's say that it's being a good healthy cell, but there's a cancer cell nearby.
2769260	2775260	If some cells don't actually take that cancer cell out, it'll replicate and kill the whole body.
2776260	2779260	And so there is a need to be a healthy cell.
2779260	2782260	There's also a need to coordinate with those around you for the things that need to happen.
2782260	2788260	There's also a need to have an immune function when there are things happening that damage the health of the whole system.
2789260	2795260	And so if we're talking about how do we want to develop people, we want to develop people in all three of those ways.
2798260	2803260	They want to have as much capacity to do the things that they should do individually.
2803260	2811260	They want to have the capacity to synergize, to have synergy with the people that are around them and that they can access.
2811260	2815260	Now, increasingly access, I guess, with the tools that we have.
2816260	2820260	The immune function, I can't explain. How does that manifest?
2822260	2824260	Is that law? Is that just police?
2826260	2828260	If you see harm happening, do you stop it?
2830260	2836260	Do you do something to correct the harm and correct the sources of harm? Who does, right?
2836260	2838260	How does that differ from synergy?
2839260	2845260	Is it because the actor is malignant as opposed to compliant or cooperative?
2845260	2847260	Well, they're within a spectrum, right?
2850260	2858260	It's actually very interesting in terms of cancer, because cancer isn't some external pathogen.
2858260	2864260	It's a cell that mutated in a way that stops doing synergy with the other cells around it, right?
2864260	2869260	Because its genetic code is altered where it doesn't actually identify with the rest of the whole in the same way.
2869260	2876260	So it doesn't want to sacrifice its own maximum consumption of sugar and reproduction rate to synergize with everything.
2876260	2884260	It's like, fuck it, I'm just going to consume and replicate as fast as I can, which is really good for it for a short while,
2884260	2888260	but it ends up killing itself and it kills the host, which is what humans are doing with regard to the planet
2889260	2895260	and also our relationships with each other, where you do that with someone else and it engenders enmity and war back and things like that, right?
2898260	2905260	There's oxidative stress and free radicals that are making cancer all the time. It's also getting addressed.
2905260	2912260	So the first stage of dealing with cancer in a healthy body is just not having that much carcinogenesis to begin with, right?
2912260	2919260	That the body is actually doing a good job of dealing with carcinogenic factors, radicals and oxidants and like that,
2919260	2922260	so cells aren't turning cancerous that often.
2923260	2929260	If there's too much carcinogenesis, and this is why we don't want to expose to carcinogenic compounds, right?
2929260	2935260	If there's too much carcinogenesis, it'll overload the body's ability to deal with cancerous cells and then you'll start to get a proliferation.
2935260	2940260	So this is the preventative side. How do we have people not become cancer cells in the first place?
2940260	2948260	How do we not deal with it on the prison or judicial side later, but on the how do we develop humans that are psychologically healthy
2948260	2954260	and if psychologically healthy also means are part of a whole, so they behave in a way that works well for them and the whole, right?
2956260	2962260	Then the next step is if a cell starts to get damaged, some oxidative damage happens to it.
2962260	2968260	The rest of the body tries to heal it first. Can we actually bring antioxidants and correct that process?
2969260	2972260	If that can't happen, then the body has to kill it.
2972260	2976260	If that doesn't happen, then it'll replicate and usually kill the body.
2977260	2986260	So when we start to think about the staging of the immune function and what that represents as a basis for thinking about judicial type process,
2986260	2993260	the basis of it should be identify what makes people orient towards harming the commons,
2993260	2996260	towards violence, towards sociopathy, towards greed,
2996260	3004260	and also identify what conditions the best qualities in humans and try to support all humans to have better development, right?
3006260	3009260	Then there is a protective function.
3009260	3017260	If people are harming other people, how do we prevent the harm from happening and how do we try to actually rehabilitate, which is the corrective force?
3017260	3024260	And it's only if rehabilitation can happen that some ongoing protection from that being able to continue to cause harm has to occur.
3025260	3042260	But when you look, okay, so you don't go kill people in Nigeria to advance your oil interests the way a Nigerian oil lord does.
3043260	3049260	But you buy gas for your car or whatever the equivalent is, right?
3049260	3060260	Which is ultimately paying the supply chain to do the thing it does, which means paying the Nigerian warlord to do wetworks at some part of the supply chain.
3060260	3068260	You might never do the kind of gruesome torture that happens inside of a factory farm,
3068260	3073260	but you might go to a restaurant and buy something that came from a factory farm, which is paying someone to do those wetworks.
3075260	3084260	And so there starts to be this deepened responsibility question of, oh, I'm affecting the world at scale in a way I'm not seeing through the supply chains I'm interacting with.
3087260	3093260	And so now there's harm that's being caused that I'm not standing up to, and I'm also complicit with.
3094260	3100260	And it's not the job of the police to stop that because it's granted by law that that can happen, but it's not right law.
3100260	3104260	Right law wouldn't allow a factory farm, you know, or those other things to occur.
3104260	3113260	So then we have to say, so what is mine to do to actually see the injustices and harms and problems in the world?
3113260	3116260	What is mine to actually step up and resolve?
3116260	3118260	That's also an important part of the question.
3118260	3123260	Very symbolic. I like the analogy to the cancer cells.
3123260	3128260	I'm going back two years ago to an episode I did with Corey Allen, a meditation teacher.
3128260	3140260	And he had this analogy where he thinks when someone gets angry with him, as a conversant, you know, someone cuts him off in traffic or something happens or cuts in line at the checkout.
3140260	3144260	And then you can see that itching for to vent.
3144260	3150260	And he treats that anger like a pathogen like a flu virus.
3150260	3156260	And what he thinks in his mind is I wonder where that came from.
3156260	3165260	Like I wonder what the heritage of that anger is, like who passed it on to you, then who passed it on to them, then who passed it on to them, then where did that emerge from?
3165260	3168260	And that's the interconnectedness, right?
3168260	3170260	Yeah.
3170260	3176260	It's the interconnectedness. It's a basis for compassion and understanding.
3176260	3180260	And it's also an immune function to keep yourself from getting infected.
3180260	3188260	Because if you get pissed off back at them and you understand it as a pathogen, you'll realize that you actually just lost your sovereignty and just got infected.
3188260	3194260	And if you see that as, you know, I don't want to get infected, then you're like, oh, that means I'm going to relate to this differently.
3194260	3198260	You can also be a be a little bit of a bookend as well, right?
3198260	3210260	If that is part of a cathartic venting procedure that allows that person to drop their anger down by X percent, but you don't then pass, you don't hold that rock and then pass it on.
3210260	3218260	Then through being conscious through the mindfulness gap of being aware of the trigger that's happened, you can let that go.
3218260	3223260	You can reduce the entropy in the system, I guess you could say it as.
3223260	3226260	Is that a way to put it?
3226260	3246260	Yeah. There's a fine point of nuance here, which is not going into reaction about someone else's poor behavior also doesn't mean condoning it and doesn't mean not having boundaries.
3246260	3253260	It's actually very important to be able to say, I know that that person does that abusive behavior because they were hurt when they were a kid.
3253260	3256260	I know that wasn't their fault. I actually feel a ton of compassion for that kid.
3256260	3259260	I know they had a head injury in war, right?
3259260	3264260	And that's really fucked them up and they still can't do that to me.
3264260	3266260	And so I love them.
3266260	3269260	I forgive them and I won't let them do that anymore.
3269260	3272260	It's a difficult line to balance.
3272260	3278260	I had a neuroscientist on talking about the neuroscience underpinning the seven deadly sins.
3278260	3283260	Very interesting, very cool rework of that guy called Jack Lewis, British guy.
3283260	3291260	And everything, all of them were in moderation, but not too much.
3291260	3293260	In moderation, but not too much.
3293260	3297260	Seneca's virtuous mean in moderation, but not too much.
3297260	3300260	And it is so hard. We are absolutist creatures.
3300260	3308260	If you put a packet of biscuits in front of me and say I can eat none or I can eat all of them, both of those situations are fine by me.
3308260	3316260	If you say that I can only have one or like half a biscuit torture.
3316260	3326260	Yeah. And so this process of the balance of right boundaries and right compassion.
3326260	3330260	There is no algorithm for it to get it right.
3330260	3336260	There isn't like a general rule of thumb that is always the right answer.
3336260	3348260	It's something you actually have to think about and feel into each situation, the instantiation of that situation, and you wrestle with it.
3348260	3356260	There are plenty of times where someone does the tough love thing to a friend or a family member that has addiction going on and that's what it took for the person to finally turn around.
3356260	3361260	Plenty of other times where someone does the tough love thing and the person just goes and kills themselves.
3361260	3368260	And that same person had they got to supported another therapy or rehab clinic or whatever could have turned around.
3368260	3376260	And so what the right answer is is not like if you have a very fast default, it's probably wrong.
3376260	3387260	It's something that you have to really take the time to reflect into what is actually called for here and then reflect into what are my biases and my biasing in a I don't want to take their burden on or biasing in a code dependent.
3387260	3391260	I must take it on direction. That's going to make me less clear.
3391260	3407260	It makes me think about the is an art distinction that you brought up and also about what self development is at its very core, which is trying to model an effective way to operate within the world.
3407260	3414260	It's trying to make as scientific as possible the way that you behave the way that I behave.
3414260	3420260	Sometimes the way that we behave there's books about relationships and friendship and stuff like that.
3420260	3426260	But mostly it tends to be personal sovereignty up with mobility agency stuff like that.
3426260	3433260	But as you've just identified there in that situation, like there is no one size fits all.
3433260	3443260	There is no objective way to decide what the life that you should lead is what your definition of a good life is it's.
3443260	3453260	Got a shaky foundation evolutionarily it's got a very biased foundation culturally and socially you know.
3453260	3459260	That is what we're trying to achieve what is the best way for me to operate within this world but there is no.
3459260	3463260	There is no universal answer to that there's better and there's worse.
3463260	3471260	But better by who worse by who you know you can you can run this back as far as you want.
3471260	3473260	Yeah.
3473260	3478260	So I would say that.
3478260	3484260	Wisdom is not algorithmic and cannot be made algorithmic.
3484260	3490260	You can't have a if this than that algorithm that actually equals wisdom.
3490260	3493260	And.
3493260	3496260	And if you can.
3496260	3505260	Then we're just a intermediate bootloader for the AIs that are better creatures than us right.
3505260	3517260	I could actually go through some long derivations as to why I think consciousness is not computational not purely computational but there's something happening in consciousness that is fundamentally trans computational.
3517260	3532260	So strong computationalism is the idea that computation is both necessary and sufficient for consciousness mind and universe and I believe that's false.
3532260	3549260	So there is something to the nature of choice and thus also good choice ethics that can be informed by lots of different principles and considerations but not perfectly prescribed.
3549260	3553260	And this is why.
3553260	3566260	At lower stages of development when people can't hold as much complexity and as much nuance with as much awareness sometimes they need just simple rules to not go off the rails.
3566260	3570260	So you think of the 10 commandments as rules like that right.
3570260	3581260	If you need to know don't kill anybody and don't rape anybody and don't the doldrum whatever like okay we'll tell you those things don't do that like the society will be better if people don't do those things.
3581260	3588260	But then you notice New Testament comes along and Jesus gives a different kind of teaching right.
3588260	3597260	Do unto others as you'd have them do unto you love thy neighbor as thyself it actually doesn't tell you what to do.
3597260	3603260	It isn't to do something or don't do something it's actually consider something a certain way.
3603260	3611260	So try to put yourself into the shoes of whoever you're about to act and ask how you would feel engage in empathy.
3611260	3623260	So it's an ethic that guides the guidance is consider something but not do this or don't do that so it's ultimately not prescriptive but there's still wisdom that can be offered.
3623260	3633260	So there's a lot of kind of general principles that we can offer that support wisdom but it's not reducible to prescription.
3633260	3644260	Now this is also something about personal development if one is wanting to grow in wisdom is it doesn't look like do this thing.
3644260	3655260	And so you also can't signal it very effectively by doing a particular thing.
3655260	3666260	I mean someone could even try to signal aligned with what I just said right they could say let me consider that as just some kind of signaling.
3667260	3681260	What I'm talking about like is a depth of earnestness of what do I actually care about and why do I care about it and how do I reflect on what I believe to be both true and meaningful right now.
3681260	3695260	And what is right action factoring what I understand to be true and what I understand to be meaningful and how certain am I on what I think is true and how bias am I and what I think is meaningful and can I refine those as well.
3696260	3702260	It surprises me that we're even able to get out of bed in the morning.
3702260	3721260	Like should I why I mean is this maybe I don't know I mean do I take the covers off with my left hand do I take the covers off with my right hand but this is the job of the ego right and this is part of I suppose the usefulness of the fact that we are still in some part primitive creatures.
3721260	3731260	That it allows us to have sufficient momentum to overcome the inertia that a constant rolling existential crisis would stop us from from being able to do.
3732260	3735260	The rolling existential crisis.
3737260	3739260	Which I grew up with.
3740260	3742260	Mostly comes.
3743260	3747260	Joseph Campbell had some nice quote something about that.
3748260	3759260	I'm getting the quote wrong but paraphrasing that people wonder about the purpose of life when they aren't engaged in the experience of feeling alive.
3760260	3761260	I love that.
3762260	3766260	And that and this is that prima facie thing that we were talking about.
3767260	3768260	In.
3770260	3787260	Moments of full engagement with reality right whether it's fascination learning something or odd the beauty of something or whatever it is is typically not when people are in existential angst wondering what's meaningful or not because it is it is it's present it is it is.
3788260	3791260	Indwelling within the experience right the meaningfulness is eminent.
3792260	3799260	Now if I'm disconnected from feeling the meaningfulness of life no thought will replace that feeling.
3801260	3803260	And so then.
3804260	3819260	You know separate I can say well what's what's the purpose of life well it's to learn what's the fucking purpose of learning well because you grow what's the purpose of that well then you can do more what's the purpose and there's no end to that right there's no terminal value that you get to where you don't say why.
3820260	3821260	Why that.
3822260	3831260	And that's because what we're trying it's it's actually just a ridiculous question it's saying what part of reality.
3832260	3833260	Is why all of it.
3836260	3847260	Right that's the question if I'm trying to say the purpose of reality is its love or its growth or its awakening or whatever it is I'm trying to I'm trying to take some little simple part I can conceptualize.
3848260	3852260	And make that the ordinating basis of everything.
3853260	3855260	Which is just actually silly.
3856260	3857260	Right.
3864260	3868260	You notice that purpose is a utilitarian concept the purpose of X is why.
3869260	3880260	The purpose of my job is I do this function at the business well if I if okay I do the marketing at the business or the accounting or the whatever it is well if I assume the business existing matters.
3881260	3888260	I then it makes sense why me doing that thing matters but it's utilitarian right assuming the value of why then I can say X relative to it.
3889260	3893260	But purpose is always extrinsic relational utilitarian.
3894260	3900260	So if I say what is the purpose of all of reality what is their outside of reality to ground that in reference to.
3905260	3911260	So it's just actually an ill formed question because purpose is a smaller concept than reality is.
3912260	3927260	So yes reality doesn't have a purpose in the sense that anything within reality does but it's also not purpose less in the way that we think of purposelessness of things inside of reality is that the concept is too small to apply.
3927260	3939260	Do you know where I have my existential crises it's when I'm in the supermarket at three a.m. every time every time I get in there if I've been at work and I finished finished at the club.
3940260	3947260	And there's this big state change from it being loud and full of havoc and then I'm on my way home and I realized that I don't have X for tomorrow.
3948260	3959260	And then that's when it strikes me when I'm in the supermarket you totally correct it doesn't happen when you're sat with the people that you care about it doesn't happen when you're on your morning walk and just considering what it feels like to have the sun on your skin.
3960260	3967260	You know those aren't the times so does that not mean that seeking those experiences.
3968260	3971260	Where we do feel connected and we do feel present.
3972260	3977260	Is that why is that not the north star for how we should spend our lives.
3978260	3985260	First I would love to suggest that you go to the grocery store at three a.m. a few times on purpose.
3986260	3992260	To have the most meaningful connection with the people who are there you possibly can.
3993260	3998260	Go with that intention to transcend the the crisis.
3999260	4005260	Well you have a Pavlovian conditioning now associated with that right you've had that experience there enough times that just going there triggers it.
4006260	4007260	And you can recondition that.
4010260	4017260	And you can recognize having choice and agency that in a place where you're questioning meaningfulness you can bring it.
4018260	4019260	Yeah that's beautiful.
4020260	4022260	And it may simply be.
4023260	4029260	Acknowledgement to one of the people who are working there it may be a deeper conversation but.
4031260	4038260	I've had so many experiences having a conversation with the person driving Uber for me instead of being on my phone.
4039260	4044260	That ended up being profoundly enlightening and some of whom are friends years later.
4044260	4048260	So it's interesting what happens when you explore.
4049260	4050260	A hundred percent.
4050260	4054260	I mean this is before we get on to should we seek being present.
4057260	4058260	This is the.
4060260	4062260	Probably the most.
4063260	4064260	Meaningful.
4066260	4068260	The most meaningful.
4069260	4088260	The most important one of the most important changes I've made over the last few years as someone who's an only child who spends a lot of time in solitude working who is comfortable with my own company overly comfortable with my own company.
4089260	4091260	Learning the.
4093260	4098260	Fulfillment and the pleasure that comes from connecting with other people.
4100260	4105260	For no reason other than they're there and that they are there and you can connect with them.
4107260	4113260	Has been such a huge change like a ridiculously big change for me and it sounds so stupid.
4114260	4121260	You know especially if you grew up with that five brothers and sisters and you all see each other every Christmas and do whatever maybe your world view and mine.
4122260	4126260	You can't really understand why I wouldn't think that that would be a good thing to do but I'm telling you that I did.
4127260	4130260	Telling you that it was very much a single focused.
4132260	4138260	Lack of just lack of even awareness of other people not even a consideration had I have been aware I probably would have considered.
4139260	4144260	But it was incredibly blinkers on and.
4145260	4146260	Yeah man like.
4147260	4149260	So this answers the question you were starting to ask.
4150260	4152260	Great about pursuing a state.
4153260	4154260	Okay.
4155260	4156260	That can be done narcissistically.
4157260	4159260	And it won't produce a meaningful life.
4160260	4161260	Why.
4161260	4162260	So.
4167260	4168260	So.
4172260	4174260	You run a thought experiment.
4175260	4178260	Everybody in the world dies and you're here by yourself.
4179260	4180260	But.
4182260	4187260	You can have like a fighter jet and Lamborghinis and like whatever mansion you want.
4188260	4189260	There's just nobody else here.
4192260	4195260	Most people when they take time to really run through that scenario.
4197260	4201260	Try to figure out how to entertain themselves with experiences for a while.
4202260	4205260	And then fundamentally can't find meaningfulness in it.
4208260	4217260	And to the extent they can it's because they have the idea of a God which is still a being they're relating with or they get really friendly with animals.
4218260	4226260	But ultimately consciousness wants to be in relationship with consciousness and is the basis of any way someone reifies meaningfulness.
4227260	4235260	Do you think that's fundamental to consciousness or do you think that that's embedded due to the social animals that we are and that every other animal is.
4239260	4240260	Both.
4244260	4245260	Interesting.
4245260	4249260	Can you can you talk me through your thinking with regards to how it's fundamental to consciousness.
4252260	4255260	So we think of consciousness associated with an organism.
4257260	4260260	Like a person maybe a dog whatever.
4262260	4269260	And we think of them having some kind of separate consciousness associated with that brain and that body container.
4270260	4276260	And so that consciousness is just is the emergent property of their brain or it dwells in it or something like that.
4277260	4282260	This is this is a really deeply flawed concept.
4285260	4293260	Because inside of my body brain package that I call I physically that I think my consciousness associated with.
4296260	4298260	Doesn't include all of the coral reef.
4300260	4305260	And doesn't include all of the plants and doesn't include the soil microbiome.
4306260	4309260	I don't think of those as I but I wouldn't exist without all of them.
4312260	4318260	So can I say that my consciousness is an emergent property of this thing without saying it's an emergent property of all of that.
4319260	4321260	Because this thing is an emergent property of all of that.
4324260	4327260	And so without the plants I'm not even an idea.
4328260	4333260	Right like there isn't even a well formed concept of me that exists without an atmosphere and oxygen.
4335260	4348260	And without the sun and without the other planets that keep the asteroids from hitting us and without just keep going on and we find the entire universe is configured in a way that I'm the emergent property of a part of it.
4349260	4358260	And you take away the galactic center you take away the sun you take away the other planets you take away the gravitational field of the electromagnetic field or the bacteria and I don't exist.
4358260	4381260	So my consciousness is not an emergent property so imagine putting me in a complete and perfect vacuum and just imagine I didn't physically die for a moment which I of course would.
4382260	4391260	What would the sensory experience be there'd be no sensory input what would the contents of consciousness with no sensory input be.
4393260	4395260	I think in words that were developed by other people.
4396260	4399260	I think in images that were created by other people I.
4402260	4406260	All of the contents of my consciousness came from the world.
4407260	4415260	So the idea that it's my consciousness is just kind of sloppy thinking in the misnomer.
4417260	4418260	That's fantastic.
4419260	4420260	The fact that you are.
4422260	4427260	The tip of the finger which is the end of everything which came before which permitted you to be.
4429260	4430260	And still not just before.
4432260	4433260	And still continues to permit you to be.
4434260	4435260	Yeah turn the sun off.
4437260	4438260	Hi.
4441260	4442260	We were touching on.
4445260	4454260	Being present as being the thing that you are to chase in order to discover meaning or why is that why is that not purely the thing that you should.
4455260	4462260	You should seek and I think that you mentioned about narcissism and the fact that there's an interconnectedness with other people.
4464260	4465260	Whether I am.
4469260	4472260	Pursuing a state through racing cars or.
4474260	4481260	Doing cocaine or doing the right kind of psychedelics or meditation.
4483260	4484260	It's not that different.
4484260	4485260	It's.
4487260	4500260	Some kind of process I can find to give me some state of experience that I feel that I don't have and that I need to arrange the world a particular way for me to have.
4503260	4504260	Right.
4508260	4509260	So.
4514260	4515260	I remember this saying.
4517260	4530260	If I bring up the Bible or the Tao Te Ching all of the various wisdom traditions were interesting to me growing up so I'm not saying this in a way that people have to accept that book is anything other than interesting.
4532260	4533260	I remember there was a.
4534260	4538260	Quote in Luke attributed to Jesus that really bothered me as a kid.
4539260	4544260	And I came to understand really profound wisdom in it after contemplating it for a long time.
4545260	4546260	Right.
4546260	4553260	Maybe obvious for a lot of people said to those who have more shall be given and to those who don't have the little they have will be taken away.
4555260	4566260	And it really deeply bothered because of the context of it being in the Bible and something that someone like Jesus would say that I wanted to be Robin Hood like and say like no no no we'll we'll give to those who don't have.
4569260	4582260	And we can see where this is true just in terms of like if you have debt you get compounding interest in debt and if you have savings you get compounding interest in savings to those who have more is given to those who don't have a little they have is taken away.
4583260	4586260	It just ends up being something that shows up as true in lots of places.
4587260	4599260	When someone is in a state of not having around relationships and they feel lonely and upset with people and whatever they're not maximally attractive.
4600260	4607260	As a person in that state right when someone's in the kind of abundance of their relationships they show up in a way that's more attractive to those who have more is given.
4609260	4611260	Ultimately they have and not have our states of consciousness.
4612260	4625260	And so there is a place where I feel like I don't have enough and I'm some kind of empty needy thing that needs to get mine from the world.
4626260	4634260	Whatever that is more acknowledgement more money more muscle more knowledge more something more good state through meditation.
4635260	4641260	But I'm still basically coming from some kind of lack and what what's in it for me.
4645260	4646260	I think.
4647260	4650260	Okay so growth can happen in that place.
4651260	4652260	But there's a.
4654260	4656260	There's a place for that concert to shift.
4665260	4666260	Where I.
4667260	4670260	Stop thinking I need anything from the world in particular.
4672260	4674260	And there is a felt sense of.
4675260	4679260	Connection to life that has a fullness and dwelling within it.
4679260	4684260	And then what what do I get out of life stops being the relevant question.
4686260	4690260	And how do I pursue a particular state stops becoming the relevant question.
4691260	4692260	And.
4694260	4699260	Are there other people who are suffering who don't know how to shift it that I can do something about.
4699260	4701260	And are the things that I can create.
4702260	4705260	For the world starts to become a more interesting question.
4705260	4708260	And I think life kind of starts there.
4710260	4711260	I love it.
4711260	4712260	I love it.
4712260	4715260	It maps very closely onto the reality that I've.
4715260	4717260	Started to see slivers of I think.
4718260	4721260	Principally through this project but also through other things.
4724260	4730260	I think you've given a very robust framework for people to understand.
4731260	4738260	The interconnectedness the fact that you are because of everything that came before and everything which is still coming now.
4739260	4740260	The fact that.
4741260	4743260	You have the opportunity to.
4744260	4748260	Effect those around you in a way that allows you to make them more of them.
4748260	4751260	And less of the things that they don't want to be.
4755260	4758260	People are always going to weaponize in a.
4759260	4762260	Rivalrous capitalist economy people are always going to be able to weaponize.
4764260	4766260	Meaning seeking wisdom seeking.
4766260	4769260	A better life state change whatever it might be.
4770260	4776260	They're always going to be able to do that because there is going to be a reward for the people who are able to dangle that carrot.
4777260	4779260	And allow other people to go chasing after it.
4783260	4784260	But the fact that.
4785260	4786260	So many.
4787260	4791260	Of the pleasures that we have in life genuine pleasures that we have in life.
4792260	4794260	Come from such simple things.
4796260	4799260	Should be a signal to people.
4800260	4804260	It's a very subtle signal it's not as loud or as brash as a Lamborghini blasting past.
4805260	4807260	But it should be a signal to people.
4808260	4809260	Of where to look.
4810260	4811260	Right.
4811260	4812260	Like it should be.
4813260	4814260	This is where you should.
4815260	4816260	Point your attention.
4817260	4818260	Because.
4819260	4824260	Hadonic adaptation hadonic treadmill lottery winner versus person that loses their legs you know.
4825260	4827260	Pick your mental model with regards to that.
4830260	4831260	And yet if you.
4832260	4834260	Consistently connected with the people that were around you.
4835260	4836260	And.
4839260	4840260	Felt.
4840260	4843260	Like you were contributing to something that you genuinely felt.
4843260	4846260	Like you were contributing to something that you genuinely care about.
4847260	4851260	And we're progressing and we're still satisfying that airy review that wants to feel like growth.
4853260	4856260	Like everything else I think would fall into place and.
4858260	4859260	The.
4861260	4864260	Beauty of the extraordinary in the ordinary.
4865260	4867260	Is is something hopefully.
4869260	4872260	That as people develop themselves they start to strip away the things that they think.
4873260	4874260	That they need.
4874260	4877260	And I left with with something which is more.
4877260	4881260	More simple and more pure and I loved it the start I didn't I didn't bring it up but.
4882260	4885260	As you mentioned about sort of the tier one tier two tier three.
4885260	4888260	Of self development that really struck me about.
4888260	4892260	His dark materials which is a children's trilogy by Philip Pullman.
4893260	4895260	And in it there's a girl called Lyra Balakwa.
4896260	4898260	Gets the name Lyra silver tongue halfway through you can tell I.
4899260	4900260	Listen to it and read it a lot as a kid.
4901260	4902260	And.
4903260	4906260	She's given this truth telling device called an elite theometer.
4907260	4909260	And she's given it and the.
4910260	4914260	Nuns in the Oxford of the universe that she lives in it's a multiverse.
4915260	4918260	Story then the nuns of the the university that she lives in.
4920260	4923260	Tell her this story about how people need to study for their entire lives.
4924260	4929260	After study for my entire life the people who have these devices have to study for.
4930260	4934260	Books and books arcane texts they have to understand all of these different things and then they can read them.
4935260	4941260	And she's she's given one in secret and it turns out that she can read it she's never learned to.
4942260	4946260	She can read it so she has natural grace she has unconscious competence.
4947260	4954260	And she's able to read it which you could draw an analogy to experiencing life the purity of experiencing life as a child.
4955260	4960260	There's a Luke Coombs song which opens up at 17 you don't think that much about life you just live it.
4961260	4965260	And I think that's the same then she hits puberty and as she hits puberty.
4966260	4971260	She loses the ability to read this truth telling device she loses that.
4972260	4976260	Conscious on competence she becomes aware it's the fall from grace it's.
4977260	4982260	And then there's this like tiny little passage towards the end of the book.
4983260	4991260	And she's speaking to somebody another one of the nuns about how am I going to get the ability to tell the truth back from from my device from the elitometer.
4992260	4995260	And she says my dear child it will take you a lifetime of study.
4996260	5001260	But the depth of your understanding will be deeper and greater than it ever ever was before.
5002260	5003260	Conscious competence.
5003260	5012260	And I think that timeline maps sort of quite nicely onto what I hope personal development self development actually ends up being for people.
5013260	5029260	Yeah there's definitely a presence that we see in children that can be overjoyed and fulfilled with the experience of life.
5030260	5039260	And this is the in no way except you turn and become like little children she passed on the king of heaven.
5046260	5053260	And to be able to have a connectedness with life that isn't always seeking.
5055260	5057260	What stimulus is going to fulfill me next.
5058260	5064260	With adult capacities that can actually show up to the world is very interesting.
5065260	5068260	There was a I saw Jordan Peterson live a couple of years ago.
5069260	5075260	And they were reading questions out from Twitter that had been submitted Dave Rubin goes up on stage and asking these questions.
5076260	5082260	And one of the questions that somebody asked him was that essentially boiled down to the depth of my consciousness causes me to suffer.
5083260	5087260	I wish that I thought less I wish that I didn't consider things so much.
5088260	5091260	It is both a blessing and occurs to feel things so very deeply.
5092260	5103260	And Jordan's answer to that stuck with me which was that you can try and regress back to a more animalistic more simple time which would be people looking at children and being envy of their innocence.
5104260	5110260	Right and thinking look at how simple it is looking at their dog and thinking look how simple it would be if I was just a dog.
5110260	5114260	You know I just lie in the sun and play with balls and stuff like that.
5115260	5119260	But you don't have that option and Jordan gave this really symbolic answer as he often does.
5120260	5128260	And he said you can take more of the poison until you girdle it into a tonic that allows you to rule your own world.
5129260	5135260	And I really like that I like the idea that it's not about escaping from Dante's Inferno.
5135260	5142260	It's about going through every single level right to the very very bottom and that's where you then sort of break it all open.
5143260	5153260	Danny man I feel like we could go on for forever but for me it's 11 a.m. and for you it's 3 a.m.
5154260	5158260	So I feel like I sadly need to let you go.
5159260	5164260	It's been a dude it's been six months since we've been planning this and I'm so grateful for you coming on.
5166260	5169260	Can I share a closing thought? Absolutely.
5171260	5177260	Every emotion has a value and has a place.
5179260	5191260	And so someone has an idea that a more developed human state never has sadness or anger or fear.
5191260	5195260	Then their idea of a more developed human state is a sociopath.
5196260	5207260	Because the key kind of definition in sociopathy is can't feel fear and remorse and guilt and certain negative emotions which is why they can hurt people so easily.
5208260	5225260	So if I'm angry I'm angry because maybe I can process it better and I can right.
5226260	5230260	Maybe I can I made up some fake meanings and I'm angry about something that didn't even really happen.
5230260	5232260	I kind of took what that person said the wrong way.
5233260	5238260	But in so far as I'm there's a real thing and I'm responding to it and anger is rising.
5239260	5244260	It's that there's something that I care about or that I love that I think somebody's harming and I'm focused on who's harming.
5245260	5249260	I'm angry about litter because actually there's a care for nature in the environment that is the basis of that.
5250260	5254260	Or someone turning an animal or a kid or whatever it is and anger rises.
5255260	5257260	So the basis of the anger is love.
5258260	5261260	If there wasn't something I loved and cared about I just wouldn't give a shit.
5262260	5263260	Go ahead and hurt it.
5265260	5271260	And if I'm afraid I'm afraid that something that I care about is going to be harmed.
5272260	5274260	So again the basis of the fear is love.
5275260	5277260	The same with sadness same with all.
5278260	5282260	So there are times where based on what's going on in the world.
5282260	5286260	Some anger arises and I wouldn't want to feel any other way.
5287260	5289260	Like there would be something wrong with me if I felt a different way.
5290260	5294260	Because I'm not making up stories I'm not reactive and I want to go hurt someone or whatever.
5295260	5302260	But there is a there is an authentic love and care for the world that also is noticing and injustice and that it expresses to that emotion.
5303260	5307260	And me feeling that in that moment is actually me and wholeness and relationship with life rightly.
5308260	5315260	So am I pursuing always being in a particular kind of happy state?
5317260	5318260	Nope.
5320260	5327260	Because that would be shutting off all of the intelligence that the various emotions that are giving me real information about reality are.
5328260	5347260	There is a certain kind of wholeness where I'm not driven by I can experience desire in a version but I'm not driven automatically by it.
5348260	5357260	I don't automatically think I don't automatically react because I'm afraid of something or have to get something I want.
5358260	5361260	I can actually just access okayness.
5362260	5363260	That's important.
5369260	5374260	But yeah I just on this topic of should we all be seeking those states.
5374260	5375260	Well yes sometimes.
5377260	5384260	And like we were mentioning about but you know even in the moment where someone's feeling really angry at an injustice they're not questioning the meaning of life.
5385260	5391260	That's also an experience of aliveness they might be feeling meaningfulness very fucking clearly in that moment.
5391260	5404260	And so does one want to actually have their emotional self and in addition to their cognitive self connected with reality yes.
5405260	5413260	And so does someone want to have some actual presence in that connection yes but that looks like all the things.
5414260	5422260	What a wonderful way to start my day and to finish yours.
5423260	5434260	I hope that we don't have to rearrange a million more times but I absolutely love to have you back on man whenever whenever we can make time.
5435260	5442260	It was really really fun I enjoyed the conversation with you and if it's something that your listeners find interesting and they have more questions and I'm happy to come back.
5443260	5445260	Fantastic thank you so much Daniel.
