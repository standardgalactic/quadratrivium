{"text": " You say that you're useless to the world if you're not competing and you need enemies to drive you. Why? I think most people who say they don't have enemies They probably don't want to tell others they have the enemy or they don't want to disclose it They're great poker players. I don't know a single person that doesn't have an enemy Everybody does We're we're very good at concealing our Our insecurities our emotions our fears our wildest desires our Enemies or comments that rub us the wrong way that wire us We are very good actors Incredible actors right now if you have a long time of talking to somebody and you kind of watch them closely And the more they talk and then eventually you're gonna find some leaks. You're like, oh, I just found one right there Boom, I found one contradiction right there. Boom. I found one and they're okay interesting. We all have a little bit of that But I do think that when you study the people that do something very big. I'm not talking about small I'm talking really really big. We're talking about some interesting people today You and I have somebody we both respect a lot Robert Green his books I'm sure you love his books. I love his books 33 strategies of war. I couldn't put it down for two years straight. I listen to that book every day in my car Straight every day. It was on repeat for two years straight. Why though? because I innocently got into sales and I had a good time in sales and business after I got out of the military and I wanted to be a bodybuilder and then I realized I'm six four It's not gonna work for bodybuilding to win Mistro Olympia because everybody's five eight five nine five ten Maybe five a lemon Ronnie Coleman, but the six four days are behind us even Luc Ferigno didn't win at that height Arnold did and then when I got into sales and Everybody was a fan then I started competing still a little bit of fan But when I started the insurance company and then I started growing market share really Then a lot of those people that were fans then started Undermining and I said got it. This is how it works. You can't be this naive. You can't be this innocent Competitions out there if you want to kind of go out there and take market share from others You want to get bigger? You can't expect for people to sit there and like everything you're doing. That's what I realized You got to choose your enemies wisely people want you to do well. They just don't want you to do better than that. Yes Yes Yeah, it's interesting. There's this story of Churchill and He's showing a young MP around the House of Lords in the UK This is before World War two you can imagine that they're wandering through these dusty hallways over there's the Toilets and over there's where we have a cigar and blah blah blah Anyway, they go into the chamber they go into the House of Lords, right? The difference actually the distance between the two front benches is the same distance as a longsword held out at arm's length From both sides. She's a kind of a funny vestige of evidently what they were worried about in the Middle Ages And they've just continued to update but they've never changed the distance of the front benches Anyway, but this young guy who's probably full of testosterone and you know, he's finally he's here with Winston Churchill He go in and this young MP starts just Sticulating at the other side he keeps referring to them as the enemy Churchill turns to me says that's the opposition dear boy. The enemy's behind you And I love that story and the reason that I love that story is that it often reminds us that symbolically we believe That the biggest obstacle we have to overcome is out there and many times the call is coming from inside of our own house I think that the worst enemy that many people have is the voice that's inside of their own head Now this voice has probably maybe come from the outside world, but we've now internalized it You know, we have become our own worst enemy in some regards. Yeah, and by the way, that's one of the enemies That's one of the enemies and there isn't one is the famous Matthew McConaughey speech that he's given. Hey one guy asked me who's the greatest actor in the world and he says hey You know, I'll tell you and then you're like I want to meet the 35 year old version of me And hey when I get to 35, you know, I want to make it 45 It's always looking forward to what that next better version of you is going to be but At the end of the day, even Alexander one of his famous quotes is quotes is I have met the enemy it is I right and Although that is one element of an enemy. That's great. We need that Michael had it Brady had it Kobe had it, but There's a there's a crazy Psychologically you can call it, you know psycho competitor that They're constantly in the search of recruiting their next enemy It's it's like, you know, life is boring if I don't have my next target, you know I'm almost you know bad for myself if I don't have the next target the next enemy And if I choose it the right way, then I'm able to bring out a side of me. I've never seen before What's the function of an enemy? What is the function of an enemy? What is the function of? Fallen in love. Why do you need to fall in love? Why do you need to have a wife? It's pleasurable. It's fulfilling. But what does it do to you though when you're in love? You know, you know how they say when when a person is in love and they go and test their brains And it's like somebody that's on drugs. You've seen this before you probably read this before, right? Okay so But what's the risk of love? Heartbreak Losing years of maybe you love the wrong person. Maybe they don't love you in return as much as you love them Maybe you're gonna give more than they're gonna give you maybe a betrayal Maybe it's an act. Maybe it's just good for the season Maybe they're gonna change your minds if they really find out what you're out There's a lot of risk to love, but why do we love? You know, it's a very unique relationship that risk is exhilarating It's exciting, you know Maintaining it. It's a lot of work. It's not easy. It's why nowadays most people don't want to get married nowadays There's a movement of I don't want to get involved to getting married. I don't want to have kids. It's too risky I want to live for myself. I don't want to have the Responsibilities I don't want to be heartbroken. Okay, great. I think you know one time a friend of mine and I Arash we're in Italy and I rented this place in Tuscan, Italy, this is like 10 years ago and we're staying there and Arash and I when we're together We like to debate and we debate about anything. It doesn't matter what the topic is anything, okay? He's like the Middle Eastern Bradley Cooper too good looking of a guy one of those guys kind of like you're a good-looking guy He's a good-looking guy So we have a three-hour drive to Cinque Terre, okay? It's a beautiful place you go to and it's a long drive to go to it. You know what we're debating about love Here's what the question was Can you love somebody you know define love for me says love is a feeling it's emotion It's this it's a great. I said say you're in jail Your wife is somewhere else How does she know you love her? How do you show her love is love a verb is love a feeling is love a noun? What happened this conversation right and Then You realize the risk of loving is worth it. I can't imagine live in life without having that love It introduces you to a person you've not met before man a great enemy does that as well a Formidable enemy is gonna introduce you to a person you've not seen before by the way could be ugly could be scary could be oh My god, who is this person? Why are you acting like this? Why are you thinking like this? So most of us when we come almost like that the movie venom It's one of my son's favorite movie, right? The venom comes inside There's a there's an ugly side to it if you lose control of it, right? And you become reckless then you hurt people around you then you're actually not good for yourself. You're destroying your own life That's why the key word is what? Choose your enemies Wisely, it's not it's not have an enemy. It's choose your enemies wisely If I choose the right enemy and then I have this relationship with this enemy Sometime it's a one-month enemy. It could be a one-week enemy could be a one-day enemy could be a lifelong enemy because it's yourself because that's a permanent enemy and Just like a love affair There is an affair with this enemy. It's actually a beautiful thing. I Love the idea of it bringing out a side of you that you didn't know Bringing out a person inside of you that you want to wear existed. So I think there's a There's definitely a function to get that into you come on crack it in there's definitely a function to To people looking to be well balanced. Oh Yeah Delicious good wow fantastic. That's what I want to hear six months of taste testing So I'm glad that it takes time to fly to Liverpool to do that There is definitely a culture on the internet of people wanting to ameliorate all of their difficult and Uncomfortable emotions to transmute them into something closer to equanimity, right? balance peace sanity and I've said this a lot and I think that I'm quite averse to Conflict by nature. That's the way that I tend to operate. I often just bow out opt for peace and then Two things changed First off, I realized that I am leaving an awful lot of motivation on the table Okay by not utilizing a very specific very potent kind of fuel Because I was aware that over a long enough time span. I think it can be toxic I think that if you're fueled by hate and distaste and fear and scarcity for long enough It becomes something that damages you more than it helps you win But it's unbelievably potent especially in times of war The second thing that happened was I became a little bit more of a target for people's ire and distaste and that meant that the underdog Loving support that everybody has for the person that's on the come up Dissolved a little bit and started to evaporate because people don't mind you doing well They just don't want you to do better than them. You know when you're on the way up Everyone roots for you because you remind them of their dreams and when you're at the top Everyone tries to tear you down because you remind them of what they gave up on So those two things changed now had a great conversation with Alex Homozy that really drove this home to me Said use what you have and a lot of people have more pain than they do pleasure Don't use it for too long 10 15 20 years like that's how you end up having a breakdown or some sort of dependency or addiction or vice But it's potent so use it and I think that The inside of enemies can bring out a side of you that you are not aware you want to where even existed is Kind of like alchemy Right. It's turning something that is both toxic and useless into something which is golden and your choice Yes, and by the way your eyes. Okay. I'm looking at your eyes right now Your eyes don't tell me a guy that is just doing this To just have fun. Okay Your eyes have a lot of fire in them. Okay, a lot of fire in them You your eyes tell a story of maybe you have a crazy side a side inside of you Okay, a side that maybe you keep inside. Okay, we're very few people maybe see But that's why you're doing as well as you're doing. I walk into this place. I do a lot of podcasts I walk into this place you chose a walk in. I'm like Sam. Where are we? He says honestly, I don't know But I think we're at the right place We walk in and I see why you do what you do and the amount of time and resources and your team putting into Hands selecting a different set. We don't do that. So what does that tell me? You're maniacal your detail oriented You got it. You're moving up right now on the podcast across the board competing with everybody You have a vision. Maybe some of it. We know probably all of it. We don't know Okay, some of it's kept even the smiles telling the story right now. You're a perfect example of this, right? If you and I sit down we get the benefit I don't know if you read Elon Musk's recent book or not Walter I think so not yet No, I've heard from every single person that's even glanced at the blurb that you need to read it You need to read it. You're gonna flip out. You're gonna love it. You'll appreciate it for a guy. That's wired like you We get to judge Elon from the outside. Okay, why would somebody? You sell a company for 180 million dollars. You take a hundred million dollars. You put it in a Solar, whatever you take 70 and Tesla you put 10 in, you know, another company vice versa, whatever the structure No, you put 100 million in SpaceX 70 million in in Tesla and 10 million you put it in solar Then you're a billionaire Then you want to do what you want to go to the next thing then boring company then you got Twitter What for and you read a story in the book about his father on how his father was are you kidding me? Oh, I mean if you some of the biggest people that we read about we watch movies about it's one of their two parents That did something to them. I'm Tom Brady a month ago we haven't met the event and The the formula I see with a lot of people that do something biggest three things one at one point in their lives They experience unconditional love because you need it. It's fuel. You have to have it even if it's just from one person Okay, unconditional love means what you screwed up you went to jail. You got a DUI you got kicked out of school You got expelled Everybody ousted you and said you're a nobody you're not gonna mount to anything you're a loser. You're this but that mother They're always said honey. I love you You can do anything to lose this one person's love One person. It's all you need. You don't need 50 of them. Just one unconditional love number two is you need somebody who brought Unbelievable pain in your life that you loved This is a person you and I loved that they destroyed our heart We couldn't do anything to gain love from this person nothing Perform talent. We love them go above and beyond give them money buy him gifts Give them incredible experiences become buff have a six-pack drive a Ferrari have a Lambo own a penthouse Have a yacht be best friends with the best athletes with billionaires no matter what you do This person brought you so much pain. You can never win this person over It is a battle your entire life try to win this person over you're never going to do it It's not going to happen. Well, you need that person as well You know what the last one is obviously choosing your enemies wisely you take a person that has those three combination by the way very rarely Will they ever tell you the entire reason very rarely will they? Fully disclose everything some of them will take it to their grave with them We will never know about it, but for someone to have the kind of a fire that goes Yours beyond 99% of people would have stopped. What's the reason for it? What else do you need? How many more accolades? How many more tens of millions of dollars? How many more cars? How many more houses? How many more top charts on podcasts number one this? What's the reason for it? You know, it's a Again, we're not talking about everybody most people will listen to this whole concept of choose your enemies wisely and they'll say That's hate. What a miserable life. What are this? What are that? No, most people chose the wrong enemies the enemies they've chosen is about being entitled is about being victims about feeling sorry for themselves And it's destroyed them the stolen stolen years away from their lives. So yeah, the way you're describing what you're saying You know, you'll typically see a pattern with those three things of people Who do something big they experience those three and unfortunately the reason why I like Musk's book is when you read it You see the pattern with all three unconditional love mom and Kimball his brother unconditional pain father choosing his enemies wisely industry Conditional, you know guys who are like this is the way we do with NASA, you know governmental agencies Censorship, you know establishment. He's just recruiting new enemies for himself every day It's like bored. He needs more enemies and more enemies, but guess who's talking about him around the world Everybody is in a hundred years from now Our kids our grandkids will look back and say and who was this Elon Musk guy Unfortunately, we're not gonna be around to talk about who it was how we viewed him But they're gonna be watching plenty of documentaries and movies about a guy like that because he chose his enemies wisely Feels to me. I've got in my mind the image of Pac-Man, you know, when he is able to eat the ghost Yeah, and the ghosts since were previously a threat to him now become fuel and that to me is I learned the three most common traits of elite performers and it was Acrippling sense of insufficiency a superiority complex and maniacal focus Yeah, and I think that those three things map on to what you were just talking about there Have you read this book? I've read the first half just so you know that part from your podcast is in the book. You're in the book Did you know this or no? No, you're in your podcast is in the book. Those three things you just talked about. Okay. It's in the book Hell, yeah. Yeah, so those three things, right? I'm scared that I'm not enough I believe that I can do more. Yep. I have the impulse control to be able to keep me focused and keep me moving forward What would you say to the people that say What you're describing sounds an awful lot like a competitor. Okay. Yeah, what's the difference between a competitor and an enemy? Yeah, it's not a competitor because to me So so in the last 20 some years I have worked my tail off to figure out a way of writing a business plan that I can teach others how to write a business plan So when you go buy books on business plans It's all boring Technical it's for a fortune 500 company or somebody that wants to go raise capital and it's so Complex and dense you will not think about a business planning book That you're gonna walk away and here's how I can write a business plan That's simple that I can look at it over and over and over again. Great. I'm good to go, right? There isn't something like that out there. This is supposed to be a business planning book that turned into an enemy's book so when I'm talking to the CEO the the publisher of a portfolio, okay Adrienne and we're going back and forth we had five hour zooms five one hour zooms Just on the title and in many cases we would sit there for 15 minutes. No one's talking We wanted what who won what he wanted what? So they wanted to figure out a title that was a straight-up title like you know Well, how to think and grow rich, you know, how to just stay very much of a business Exactly something like that and then eventually I'm selling Adrienne. I'm simple. That's not what it is This is much deeper than that. It has to do with enemies and eventually on the fifth time of choosing the title Guess who finally says the title the book has to be choose your enemies wisely Adrienne does from portfolio And I said that's the one it was a battle of attrition It was a battle of attrition a few hundred of them, right? But but it's an interesting concept when you're saying Competition to me the 12 building blocks that I talked about in this book, you know We have different categories because one side of the building block has to do with emotion The other side of the building block has to do with logic and you read this when you were going through the book So on the emotion side, you know, it's gonna move us. So for example, I mean, what skill says do I need to learn? Well, I need to learn how to do podcasts how to ask questions How to do research you told a Churchill story at the beginning with the sword the size and hey, your enemies are not ahead of you They're behind you. Okay, you have to go find that story. That's content, right? Okay, so that means you're constantly reading Why is this guy so good at what he does with content? Okay? He's very detailed. Look at the lighting Look how he doesn't look at his sets. He's intentional. He's not winging it Everything you're doing for the most part 95% of it can be replicated by somebody else But the 5% is your wit is your interest is the curiosity. I did a person has it or they don't have it, right? Okay, so yes, I can pick up those skills, but do I have your willpower? That's emotional. Yes, I can go study the competition Let me see the top podcast is out there what they're doing. What is the category for politics for business for sports for comedy? Yes, but enemies bigger study competition all you want But enemies a complete different criteria that you're talking about you can have all the money in the world Fantastic, that's finances. That's money. You can go raise money. There's plenty of companies that raise money Quibi a few years ago raised two point thirty billion dollars from who all the big money guys Everybody gave Quibi money. What happened to them Katzenberg make Whitman. Everybody behind it went out of business in 1962 1962 was a super-saving center Which is the year where Target came out Walmart came out and Costco came out all the same year 1962 okay in 1962 when these companies came out Kmart goes and raises a ton of money five years later Kmart has 250 locations Walmart has nine locations five years later Kmart on a leader's bulletin within five years guess who's winning Kmart's dominating all logical all numbers Spreadsheet etc. Etc. You couldn't tell me the founder of Kmart Who he is if I ask who's the founder came you're not gonna say mr. Kmart, right? That doesn't make any sense. What happened to Kmart a few years ago Kmart goes out of business. They're no longer round You know how many employees Walmart has around the world 2.3 2.5 million employees Do you know Walton Sam Walton when the best books you can ever read is made in America? It's 200 pages. He walks to you through how he built Walmart Do you know what his poorest kid is worth today poorest kid is worth 50 billion dollars today? He's got four of them. Can you imagine these guys at Thanksgiving? They're like hey Johnny I noticed man. You're only at 50 billion. Do I need to you know go for me? You know raise some money for you now. It's gonna be all right. You're gonna make it through What's the moral of the story the moral the story is One is logic the other one is emotion emotion brings out a different set if it can be controlled madness Controlled emotion It's gonna go into a different gear that a normal person's not gonna have we'll get back to talking to Patrick in one minute But first I need to tell you about element Elements contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio of sodium potassium and magnesium with no junk no coloring No artificial ingredients or any other BS It is a healthy alternative to sugary electrolyte drinks and it's how I've started my morning every single day for over three years now You don't need coffee first thing in the morning You're a denicine system that caffeine acts on isn't even active for the first 90 minutes of the day But your adrenal system is and salt acts on your adrenal system best of all They have a no BS no questions ask refund policy where you can buy it and try it Completely risk-free and if you do not like it for any reason They will give you your money back and you don't even need to return the box right now You can get a free sample pack of all eight flavors with your first box by going to the link in the description below Or heading to drink lmnt.com Modern wisdom that's drink lmnt.com slash modern wisdom Let's start competition. You're saying competitors, right? Okay. No problem um In high school You can see somebody who was the best basketball player super competitive at that level say they're tall They're six six. They can jump 40 inches. They have a quick first, you know step They're very athletic in every way. They're the best athlete in the county even in the state for that position. No problem They go to college They can compete But maybe they're coming off the bench average in 7.2 points a game three rebounds to assist no problem They may not make it to the NBA But let's just say he makes it to the NBA plays a year two years Then he goes to Puerto Rico Then he goes to spain then he plays in turkey then he plays in china 10 years later never comes back to the NBA He's out now. He's an assistant coach in Puerto Rico or somewhere else Then there's a guy that comes to the NBA. He competes. He's talented. He shows into work He's a very good worker stable guy doesn't do the drugs doesn't do the alcohol He hooks up with a lot of girls, but he doesn't get in the way He doesn't respect, you know, he respects his teammates wives. He doesn't do anything He plays for 15 years makes 200 million dollars good for him Then you have the cycle competitor who Counts The 55 kids ahead of him that were chosen as the best high school basketball player And he's ranked number 56 and one by one by one He targets every one of them until he takes him out his name is Kobe Bryant Then you have michael jordan in 1984 Where the number one draft pick is a kimalajuan fair good a lot good selection for the rockets number two is sambui I think portland picks him up or seattle picks him up. Number three is michael jordan. You pick me number three Yes, what happens to michael? these guys michael was never the highest paid guy in the NBA the only time michael was the highest paid guy in the NBA was The last year made 33 30 million dollars Scotty pippin made more money in the NBA than michael jordan ever made michael jordan today's worth 30 billion dollars scottie pippin is not what's the difference It's a very different mindset scottie's a competitor, but he's not at michael's level by the way It's very easy to criticize a guy like you who wants to compete And maybe internally you don't want to compete you want to dominate Maybe internally you want to show everybody. No, I'm going to be number one. Let's just say with him because professionally want to do this totally cool But there's a lot of other competitors out there that have good podcasts and they're doing a good job It's just a different mindset when you have that enemy. By the way Very rarely will those guys ever truly again reveal their top driver and the top enemy why? Because it's it's it's an element of insecurity. Yeah, it's a signal level of status It is it's it's and it's also I don't want to give the other person credit power I don't want to give that other person more power than the person thinks they have you don't have power Or because somebody may be like, oh, I'm your enemy. I control you exactly Well, when it's a part of the come-up story. Yeah, it's romantic Right. It's it's uh, it's grassroots. It's what's keeping you Going look at look at how I was mistreated by my first high school coach. They didn't see the I'm going to prove it to them That's a beautiful origin story age 20 age 45 That just sounds like someone who can't get the chip off his shoulder. Yeah So yeah, I think it's it's interesting how the tools that got you here aren't the ones that will get you there And how the strategy this is again one of the reasons why continuing to rely on Resentment and bitterness and the chip on your shoulder and enemies for too long becomes a very toxic fuel And it's also importantly optics are very very important It's a signal of low status Okay, you brought I don't disagree when you brought up a story of Churchill, right? Okay The world is weeks away from all speaking german Okay, if we lose the war the guy wins no problem chamberlain Cannot hold it together and the story about How the only way Churchill said he was going to come back is for chamberlain to come and beg him The only way Does it sound like something Churchill would do by the way? Absolutely. Yeah, Churchill sat there and said, okay He has to come and ask me because chamberlain sent other people he said no no no no no Only one person Has to come look at me face to face And say you can do a job. I can't do come back and help us think about Think about that now Visualize that scene we can see it in a movie or we can read in a book and by the way Say 50% of it is true. The other 50% is true, right? The other 50% is a lie and it's like build up mythical over generations, right? I believe that Churchill would want to hear it from A chamberlain. Have you heard of Churchill's ministry of ungentlemanly warfare? No, so this is a phenomenal book that everybody can go and read uh Before the second world war It was considered ungentlemanly to use guerrilla style tactics and in fact one of the British politicians said something to the effect of if this is what it takes to win the war I am prepared to lose they were The brits saw anything shy of gentlemanly conduct in war as a loss even if it resulted in a win And Churchill came in and changed that he was the one that changed that culture So he puts together this crack squad of eccentric weirdos One guy invents the limpid mine, right? Which you can descend to depths and then it'll attach using magnets and it'll blow things up another group Develop what is the uh predecessor to the sas another group are working on disguises and and guerrilla tactics to disrupt Infrastructure as the german advance is trying to move forward. Uh, so yeah, Churchill was prepared to play dirty But you know, you look at the tactics that were used They only came about because of one man who legitimated it and and he said we will do whatever it takes to win Now, here's the thing when you hear a story like that Um, somebody may say well, you know, what a what a what a cold-blooded bastard? Oh my god, no wonder people hate him No wonder he is who he is Where many president moved the bust of Churchill in the white house of wins that take this out So I don't represent what he represents. Everybody acts all hard, right? We can hate a Churchill during peacetime but during wartime You you beg for a Churchill to rise up wartime leaders like Churchill you only appreciate during wartime There's a really interesting insight from evolutionary psychology here. There's two types of leadership One is from dominance and the other is from prestige, right? One is uh more authoritarian It's tyrannical. It's very aggressive. The other is uh more altruistic. It's uh the The rise to power is denoted It's spread through the group everybody chooses together that this is someone who we all believe has the skills and The dominance is not the same and there are specific times when you want dominance and when you want prestige And in times of conflict you want Dominance sure sure you could say it in business. It's startup versus when it's more established, right? But here's also the thing like the part where you got to give a lot of credit to steve jobs steve jobs had a startup mentality and then he took that to the company and then he hires You know his uh scully that comes in from pepsi and he says you want to sell sugar Can you know water for the rest of your life or you want to change the world? He brings him in then he ends up being the reason to fire jobs Jobs leaves goes builds Pixar Sells it to disney most of his wealth is tied to disney not at apple then he comes back And he realizes that style of leading is not going to work to take the company to the next level when he comes back to apple The first phone call he says he says the idea of thinking microsoft is the enemy is behind us We can't think like that anymore This is what steve job says and he goes to microsoft and he gets 300 million dollars from microsoft To invest into apple and these guys hated each other microsoft came out in 76 apple came out in 77 a year apart And everybody was always comparing the two together bill gates ended up being much richer than steve jobs, but steve jobs was admired way more than Bill gates. So what does this mean? The individual has to Evolve like you have to also Recreate yourself as you're going through this the same enemy that drives you when you're 22 years old Should not be driving you at 32 years old or else you haven't matured You should also out matured that enemy And then 32 something else should be driving you then 42 then 58 and 63 then 75 But you are going to have those love affair with those enemies That's a love affair You had an affair with this enemy over an eight year span over a 13 year span over a six year span over a six month span But you know, there is truth in the idea of you still being driven by that enemy 18 years after you beat that enemy 13 years after you beat that enemy Someone who I think is particularly good at creating enemies from modern pop culture and our industry is bench of hero Okay, what do you think about what he's doing at daily wire from an enemy perspective and and generally You talked about recently with his feud with Tucker Carlson or period everything overall um I think Tucker's a true believer. I think Tucker is not somebody that If he's doing it intentionally to get under your skin Let's say that's 20 percent. Let's say it's 10 percent because he's witty and he's smart and he's sharp Tucker or ben i'm sorry ben ben Shapiro. So you're talking about right? Yeah Let's say ben is doing that 10 or 20 percent intentionally to get under your skin. Okay But this guy at a young age wanted to be supreme court. Just you know, he's been wanting to be that for a long time This is not a regular guy. I think at 12 or 13 years old. He performed in front of a couple thousand people His level of intelligence of how early on he got a degree went to college 15 16 years old that all the stuff that he did so He's 100 true believer Does he have an element that he can Talk to somebody and say I can murder you in a debate right now if you really want to go there. Yes He has that element as well. Yeah, does he have a side of him that's a maybe a bully type a little bit? Sure Well, don't forget during school. He was very heavily bullied himself very heavily bullied But that's what happens typically to people like him, but that may be the number one driver That he's continuing because he wants for the rest of his life for those bullies to talk about that ben Shapiro used to be a Classmate What makes him go out to pace that he goes you think it's just all these other guys that we see there's no way You think he would ever tell us you think his own family knows that highly doubted It's to himself many of these people that he has in his life Anybody that goes at that pace like tucker Carlson today. I don't know if you saw the approval He got I think they got 150 million dollars today from some organization who did took his organization Yeah, so finally today the ward is out that he raised money. It's it's a hundred It's a big amount of money that he finally raised today Who's his enemy? He's got a very easy enemy. He's got fox news former employer as an enemy He's got a lot of political people as an enemy people with silo some as an enemy You know how many enemies tucker got you think tucker needs another 300 million dollars that he has in a bank account I highly doubt so He's doing it for a complete different reason because he wants to give the middle finger to five 10 15 different people in his life You just sense it with tucker and by the way, you know, it's wild right now Ben Shapiro went after tucker this week. What happened because of uh, uh, israel tucker's position where he says we should focus on a hundred thousand Uh, uh, people in america that are dying from fentanyl not focused on what's going on in israel and gaza and ben Shapiro says You know, we can chew gum and walk at the same time specifically from the moral standpoint We can handle two different moral issues, but you know, they're going back and forth whether it's a seasonal thing or not That's a complete different, you know competition that we're talking about. I suppose Uh, how would you say enemies of convenience are sometimes good for optics? You know, what have we just seen dylan danis logan paul ksi tommy fury jake paul tommy fury logan paul jake paul and Who's the jiu-jitsu guy stocked in slaps Diaz, thank you. Nate Diaz love that guy Enemies of convenience. Yeah, you know like nothing gets people's tongues wagging more than you creating a little bit of a feud on the internet dc, uh They announced yesterday speaking of feuds and speaking of disney That the daily wire are going to do that own version of snow white with brett cooper starring in snow white. I saw that I saw that I mean that to me is you know, largely a declarative statement of culture war on what's happening with Children with children's movies, you know, it's synthesizing down all of the little tangential issues that have been included Is there anything to do with the push toward the sort of books that are in school? Is it us? You know denying this uh rachel's ziggler ziggler throwing snow white under the bus like she doesn't have a prince charming She has a stalker. We don't need that. What do you think about that? I think that it is a very dangerous lesson to teach young girls that Boys that show interest in them are dangerous and to be avoided I think it makes for a generation of fragile narcissistic fearful young girls That I wouldn't want as a daughter and that I don't want as a mother. You know what a perfect example that is The movement of feminism is the ultimate example of not choosing your enemies wisely You chose men as being the enemy 40 years later 50 years later you're 65 years old Single not married no kids You're living in an apartment or a condo with a dog Or a cat that that's all you ever talk about and you're lonely and you're sitting there saying I was wrong Men are not the enemy, but guess what? That movement stole 50 years of your life. You know how painful that is What what she's doing right now with the messaging she's given and then getting out there and saying well I don't want to be able to have to do this. No, you know That's not necessarily going to be that way nowadays, you know, women don't need that anymore It's a completely different era right now. We're talking about and to do this at a hundred your anniversary of disney Yeah Really With what waltz and many of us I remember living in iran watching disney cartoons translated in farce Literally in farce It's it's very weird when you watch it in farce because the language is a rough language, you know, you watch pinocchio In farce it's not as appealing right, but we grew up with this stuff You know, we grew up with watching these cartoons to see that taking place Is uh, if you ask me, it's absolutely pathetic, but you're seeing how many back-to-back-to-back flops disney has right now Yeah, and it's not a good look. Um, by the way, the buyers who want to buy disney. They're loving this Apple's one of the most qualified buyers. They they hope disney makes five more flops apples sitting there saying make five more flops. Iger, please by the way Have you read the ride of a lifetime by bob Iger? Okay another interesting guy what he did with a 38 career at abc Obviously he's been there a lot longer, but when you read the book the first 38 run To be one of the best power brokers Then to finish your career up the way you're doing right now very Very bad way of finishing it. He's not an idiot, right? You don't have the excuse of not knowing He is for what a point you just made he is 100 not an idiot This guy was about to run for president bob Iger was gonna he was one of the guys that everybody was trying to get to Run for president him and oprah. They were supposed to be this literally. This was the conversation so he also ended up choosing the wrong enemies and The wrong allies Not realizing your best allies are parents. You're losing parents who have been watching this for years You're losing the people that this is a legacy product It's another example of a complete screw-up that's going to come out of discount for somebody else like apple I mean look at to go back to ben and what jeremy are doing over the daily wire Hershey's do a campaign that they don't like within five days. They've released their own chocolate bar That shaving company does something they don't like within 24 hours, maybe they filmed a video with a mclaren for jeremy's razors They don't like the way that's fantastic commercial by the way. Well done. Jeremy's got jeremy's got skills I listened to him and shepiro talking about the fact that originally jeremy was the talent And ben was the money man and the the the uh data guy behind the scenes Do you know zack levi? I think it's him exactly by the actor who played the uh, what is the movie? the the the Super hero for kid movies. What is the guy's name? Ben 10? What is it? Ben 10? No? It's a recent one. You're the one with like yeah four kids. Yeah, trust me. I've seen this movie a couple times He played kurt warner a recent movie that came out the american underdog. He played kurt warner him and Jeremy used to have a production company apparently 10 15 years ago And zack ended up being a big time actor in hollywood doing very good for himself And by the way, jeremy is another great example of a guy that's got enemies. Just look at his eyes When you talk when you hear jeremy speak You see the fire built for enemies. He's got enemies and he wants to take those enemies out But that's why I thought the daily y was an illustrative example because they are as far as I can see largely a company built on Identifying enemies, you know, they're very much in opposition to ideas that they don't like to movements They don't like to people that they don't like and uh Yeah, man, I mean it's you have to be built for that You really really do need to be built for it. And it certainly seems to me that what ben and what jeremy are doing over there is Purpose built to be The anti this the anti that and a lot of the time it's new movements that they don't just they don't agree with The market's gonna prove if the concept is gonna work or not And if it can't sustain because if it's a built to solve concept, they're gonna be they're gonna succeed But can somebody else come and pick up that concept and continue with that with the same level of fire? It's gonna take a couple decades to figure that part out. It's interesting to think, you know from from our side When you see those rachel ziggler interviews and she's saying courting is stalking Um a girl doesn't need to be saved by a prince. You know, she's busy thinking about how she can fulfill her own dreams And becoming the woman that she always knew that she could run and so forth You think a lot of people are Is that really the you know the highest Manifestation is that real self-actualization for young women nowadays? That's the question they ask and you're totally right that look ultimately the market will choose There's no question about it. The market will choose the market is brutal. You know, you know, it's a great thing about It's always right. It's always right, you know, you can you can say well, let me tell you I'm the best bodybuilder in the world Yeah, okay. Look at your calves. Yeah, good luck. You go put those a little skimpy, you know Shorts on and see what your You know legs look like now. You're not as good as you think you are you're full of it. Yeah market is brutal podcast business concepts investments drinks You know alcohol books you write when we first wrote When I first wrote your next five moves and we launched at august of 2020 This is during the peak of kovat My publisher simon and schuster asked and says so how do you think the book's gonna do? How you gonna judge the book me and greg dinkin are talking I said If the book is doing well three years from now, it was a good book You can have a great marketing campaign the book does well the first 30 60 90 days But is the book selling three years later if it is That's a great book because the market will tell you that Yeah, very interesting to think about how optics and There are ways to game the system and I think people are very They're hyper aware of this They understand that there are People who have managed to use Tactics and hacks to get themselves into a position that they maybe didn't quite deserve that the legitimacy of the product the book or whatever it is the person who Maybe uh when megan markles autobiography comes out perhaps people would Accuse her of doing something like this, right? It's not to do with the actual product. It's to do with the positioning And sometimes that does work but ultimately Form is temporary and class is permanent navals got this great quote where he says Um Karma is just people repeating their beliefs Actions and behaviors until they finally get what they deserve You just roll the dice you keep rolling the dice, right? Every single time every single thing you do the way that you interact with the uber driver The way that you pay or don't pay the bill or invoice that you've got every tiny little thing each time Is an opportunity for your true nature to come up and people just keep on rolling the dice Keep on rolling the dice and then every so often someone hits double one and you go. Oh, there we go But it's temporary you can't do permanently megan merkel whether her motives are really because she loves The prince and it's like harry. She's in love with them or she's using the power to bully and Get what she wants out of it The market is brutal. Look what happened to amber herd for how many years did everybody think? You know johnny depp was a bad guy for how many years? Oh johnny depp was an abusive You know relationship all this up and then they start showing the clips The videos and johnny's comfortable. Would it be in public? and all of a sudden 180 The world is like what an asshole She is Not him. I love johnny the next thing you know the love affair was like How many more men are going through like johnny is and then how many women said she ruined it for women who were actually abused So yeah for longest time. Oh my god crying is so such a so difficult time what he was so when he hit me We fell for it But we will only fall for it temporarily not permanently the market will reveal eventually Hopefully yeah, I again man form is temporary classes permanent and people will ultimately get what they deserve Uh when it comes to the courting is stalking Culture that we have at the moment You've got a daughter. You've got young sons You also spend some time undervalutainment talking about Intersexual dynamics and what's going on between the sexes What do you make of the current dating scene for men and women and why do you think it's being demonized in some ways? From what perspective from I think that there is an anti dating culture at the moment I think that men and women are being encouraged to be treated as equals. Uh, sorry as adversaries not as equals, right, right? Um, I think it's transactional today. I think it's easy today I think the swipe right community is it's friday night 11 o'clock. Let me swipe right. I'm gonna use 20 Someone's gonna get back to me if they swipe right and they so and typically I would go after an eight and a half nine But it's friday night. I'm gonna go do a six and a half seven. No one's gonna know I'm gonna invite her back to my place. She knows if she's on tinder. I'm not on bumble. Whatever these dating apps are And so it's transactional strategic No one's gonna know and literally not a lot of people are gonna know you can really run through 20 40 50 100 nowadays and it's not a Big deal. Okay So what does that do? Whatever is too easy to come you devalue it. You don't value it that highly You know my era you had to court You had to prospect you had to have scripts. You had to build relationship. You had to follow up We didn't have these types of things to do. We had my space the last time I was single. There was my space Okay, I DM'd uh My wife on my space my wife and I knew each other for five and a half years Eventually we're in palm springs for the first time. She's single. I'm single ever for five and a half years We're both single And You know we go on a date first date PF Chang's December 29 of 2007 Used just when PF Chang used to be good when they had their uh, their their noodle soup They don't have it anymore used to be they took that away phenomenal item on the menu. I'm convinced they they fell apart after that So anyways, we go to well PF Chang's by the way, if you're watching bring it back It was actually a very good item on the menu. So we go on a date. There's magic She's smiling. I'm smiling. You know the smile. That's kind of like I'm happy to see you And then it's midnight where the last people left at PF Chang's You know waiter comes up to me and he says what's going on I said, you know, my wife wants to follow divorce. She doesn't want to be with me anymore. So your wife why? Yeah, I come from a different religious background and her family's convinced we got to split up and he has no clue We're not married. We're just on our first date He sits down for 15 minutes convincing her to stay with me if you love him stay with him It was a beautiful, you know Seeing that we have we go in the car she goes home the next day I take her we go do stairs in Santa Monica We go to church. We go to earth cafe in Santa Monica Then we go to boarders I buy her book on our second date called 101 questions to ask before you get engaged on our second date by norman right She's like, what's this? I said, I'm not looking for a girlfriend. I'm looking for a wife. I'm 28 at the time Uh, I said, I know exactly what I want. I've already done this exercise with three other girls If you want to go through it great You need to answer the questions. Let's meet up when you're ready and let's go through it week later Six hours at her place one by one by one each question we go through I said, this is somebody I can date and by the way, it's ugly because you got to talk about everything in the book so today That's not it anymore today. It's too Risky today. It's you don't have access to that anymore today percentages are coming out where marriages from dating sites have the least chance of working out versus marriages where you meet somebody through a referral Where you say pat I've known mary for seven years. I think you and her should talk not know what's going to happen Let me set you guys up. Let's take our girls and do a double day. Cool. Hey, I kind of like her This is good. Well, you're telling me seven years. I've only seen her be with one guy larry five years He was an asshole then she's been with this other guy two years, but she's single now Now I have some kind of a history I'm dealing with right So it is a different climate now with kids. It's a different story on how you raise him my 10-year-old son he's he's been He's had a girlfriend since he was five years old literally at a birthday party at five years So he's making out with this other girl at this they've embossed they've embusters. I'm like babe What is going on his mom is asking me, you know, our kids are kissing. I said, well, I got a son You got a daughter. You may want to stop your daughter, but I'm not gonna stop my son So she's like well guys guys. No stop stop. They don't even know what's going on So there's you need to have the conversation with kids early today Uh, I remember having conversation with my boys when they were six and five in the shower and I said, okay We need to have this conversation together. What's that? Okay, stand up. That's your dangling. That's his dangling This is my dangling Only you get to play with your dangling one day. You're gonna find a girl That's gonna play with your dangling till then God gave you that dangling for only you to play with your dangling now. You got to see how they're looking at me By the way, they're looking at me like this and my wife leaves quickly. She's like, babe. This is unconscious, babe. You can leave So we have that conversation I think you need to have the conversation today because most parents are on middle eastern They don't have those types of conversations No one's talking about sex and condoms and all this kind of stuff You need to start early but the dating scene today Very very different than what it was when I was single Uh, I if I wanted to go date today and find a wife my approach would be very different than what most people are doing today Very different We'll get back to talking to patrick in one minute But first I need to tell you about Shopify Shopify is the e-commerce platform revolutionizing businesses all over the world Whether you're a garage entrepreneur or ip already Shopify is the only tool that you need to start run and grow your business online without the hassle Shopify powers 10% of all e-commerce in the united states And if they are good enough for huge brands like gymshark, they are good enough for you too Shopify puts you in control of every sales channel So whether you're selling satin sheets from Shopify's in-person POS system or offering organic olive oil on Shopify's all-in-one e-commerce platform They've got you covered and once you've reached your audience Shopify has the internet's best converting checkout to help you turn browsers into buyers If you are someone who is looking to start a business online Shopify is the only place to go.

Where's dina dina's in the back? Okay, you're telling me about dean and what dean does he's been with you two years three years? What you said 2,500 episodes and how many uh, uh 700 episodes two and a half thousand videos Two and a half thousand videos 700 episodes. Yeah, okay. What does that say about you a lot? Okay, if somebody works with you for six years, what are they gonna learn about you your temper your expectation? Hey boys, are we ready? This is all standard and expectation the expectation that you have that is a reflection of he likes working with you Why does he like working with you? I don't know but you do something right for him to want to work with you And then you told me what you're doing with them structure. That's private stuff that you told me So you watch people you watch Values principles you watch how they treat people you watch how people treat them you watch how people respond to them you watch How they are with powerful people you watch how they are with regular average day-to-day people you You look for that today It's not the cars the the lambos the ferrari's the houses all that stuff. By the way, i'm a capitalist and I love all that stuff but I like that stuff because Different reasons. I enjoy the game. I'm a kid I'm turning 45 tomorrow. I'm 44 today for the last day tomorrow. I'll be 45 But there's an element of childlike stuff that brings out The 14 year old kid when I look at a baseball card. I'm a kid when I look at a baseball card The average person's like who cares about baseball cards. That's a different element, but The relationships the way they treat people values and principles what they value you look for those types of things and Eventually enough will be revealed the more you pay attention That's one of the byproducts I think that is dangerous sometimes of people who play the game that they get captured by the game and they forget that it is a game And they see the game as reality They don't realize that there is something which is supposed to be deeper which is hidden below the surface So I did rogan's show last year And I listened back to the episode he said something on it that I really wanted to dig into And he listened back I listened back and and pulled this this really really powerful insight for me It was one of the most powerful things I learned last year and he said Just because something is hard to obtain does not mean that it is valuable Just because something is hard to obtain doesn't mean it's valuable. Correct. Yeah, just because it's difficult to get Doesn't mean that it's valuable Look at the car. He's arriving. Look at the watch. He's wearing. Look at the girl He's with these things were hard to obtain so you presumed that they were valuable But you didn't realize that what's genuinely valuable are friendships and relationships And a comfort and a confidence in yourself and peace of mind and sanity And being able to positively impact the people around you. So it got me thinking I've been really sort of reflecting on this over the last year And I did some research into the history of the pineapple so 1492 christopher columbus lands on the island of guadalupe And for the first time ever a westerner sees a pineapple and you look at it It's kind of a royal fruit that's got this stupid crown on its head and he writes in his journal He describes the taste of a pineapple if you've never had a pineapple before you blow your head off You know if you haven't got processed I remember the first time I had a pineapple. Yes, it's insane Of course, anyway, they take a shipload literally back to the prince of spain Prince aragon the second Take this entire shipload back one of them makes it that isn't rotten and the prince is allowed to eat it And again almost gets this sort of mythical quality to it the pineapple Very quickly the british quite rightly so they They start to see it as this symbol of opulence, right? They see it as this symbol of wealth So they would parade pineapples around at dinner On a platter and they would use them over and over and over again You could rent a pineapple, right for the evening. This is the sort of house in which you might be able to see a pineapple, right? Castles had pineapple statues on the top of them there would be Fountains with pineapples at the front of someone's estate All of this occurred because of the scarcity of a pineapple. It was 8 000 pounds to get one pineapple. Wow, right? That was the equivalent back then 8 000 pounds. It was a symbol of of privilege and opulence and wealth and What it meant was that people really looked up to this one object then the french a couple of hundred years later. They invent greenhouses And that allows us to grow tropical fruits at higher climates higher latitudes Price drops and guess what? No one starts parading the pineapple around anymore The scarcity of it was largely determining the value of it And that story and what I called rogan's value difficulty conflation just because something is hard to obtain does not mean that it is valuable Now I would argue that a pineapple is valuable no matter how hard or difficult It's like a dialed fruit no matter how good or how difficult it is to get a hold of But I really love that insight because I think that it shows how non valuable But difficult to obtain things get slipped into our desires I see that particular expensive possession that intrinsically I don't actually care about maybe I've never been a watch guy Maybe I've never been a shoes guy. Maybe I've never been a car guy But I want it I want it because it's hard to get okay Well, what if there is a quicker route to what fulfillment? What if there is a more direct path because there are some people out there for whom Keeping up with the jonesism materialism is an inbuilt part of their life But I can say as someone that doesn't have that bone in my body particularly that for me material possessions They don't make a massive difference to my quality of life. I like nice things. I like to fly business I like you know, I like a nice house and blah blah blah But there's people who are tuned into that, right? Maybe it's the upbringing the genetic predisposition whatever whatever whatever But I think that people should be very cautious. Why is it that I'm chasing this thing? Am I chasing this thing because it's something which is valuable or am I chasing it simply because it's something that's difficult to get Yeah, that's a by the way a very good story And a great quote. I remember in iran Pineapple is on on us. That's how we say we say on on us And anybody in iran who had pineapple you were rich two things pineapple and banana in iran Only rich people have pineapple and two good fruits. Yeah, two good fruits. And then I go to germany And bananas are everywhere But the first time I had pineapple. I had it in the states. I couldn't believe we were having pineapple I thought we were rich when we had pineapple. I said mom, are we finally rich here? We made we retired on a pineapple. Yeah, it was on on us and I remember I was in Ninth grade first time ever we went and ate at sizzlers. I thought we had made it. I'm like guys you will not believe what restaurant I don't know if you know sizzlers, but sizzlers in us is not a fancy restaurant I thought we made it because we ate at sizzlers. Yeah, you know what say I used to think And you know this whole concept of people who are too much about Fancy things it's kind of like well look at this guy all he cares about his money all he cares about his fancy things All he cares about is these cars and life with the rich and famous and all this other stuff Eventually I realized not everybody is driven by the same thing all I care about that's something that drives you Okay, my oldest son could care less. You know what he wants for a car his favorite car a jeep That's his dream car. My daughter says I want a white Ferrari Okay, and I said, who do you think's gonna buy that for you? Well daddy, you're gonna buy I'm not buying you white for are you gonna buy yourself a white Ferrari? Dylan wants a completely different car my oldest son. You know what you know what is Absolutely a great day for him outside in the dirt playing with lizards catching animals Playing with dogs and cats That's an incredible day. By the way, he's been like done since eight months nine months My youngest son 10 years old first time I take him to my barber to get a haircut And one of the girls at this place they give Massages at the end when you get the haircut my oldest son says don't touch my back Don't don't touch me. He would go like this. He's like no no dad. I don't tell her not to touch me, right? But my 10 year old son it was five at the time She's like, can you also massage me over here? Oh, he likes to find the things in life to find her things in life, right? My oldest son loves dogs. He loves animals my youngest son Don't get on my bed get off my bed My oldest son wants a dog right next to him the youngest son doesn't want any of the dogs next to him and his dad loves dogs I love animals, right? so I'm not I'm not you know I think Joe specializes in doing the heart if there's anybody that specializes in doing the heart is joe. You kid me like joe is a enamored by doing the heart But also joe's learned to be so self-aware of himself to know what he likes I said joe, what do you think about sports? Is uh, I know nothing about sports. I don't watch sports The only thing I watch is ufc Joe now that you're getting all these eyeballs. What's your vision? What if we can do this pat? The only thing I want to do is I just want to podcast. Yeah, I want to go hunt. I want to be my family I want to do ufc. This is all I want to do the level of clarity. He has of where he's at Props to him now Dana white slightly different Dana's not worth a few hundred say he's worth a half a billion dollars today Why is he still driving? Why is he still pushing? Why is he still competing? Why is he still wanting to be number one? Who's his enemy? He drives around in nice cars likes to go to the casino likes to be around with people having fun late night Two different dynamics two different personalities. Look at the organization they built with you I mean Thinking of someone who chooses their enemies tactically Dana is not someone who's shy of a fight He loves it, you know, if you were to think of a c-suite level fighter Dana white is is pretty well and bring the crop. Yeah, you've you've spent a good bit of time sort of Orbiting that that whole crew of people. What have you learned from your? Insights about the UFC and sort of what that says about Dana. Oh listen what I'm about to say about Dana is Some people are not gonna like it, but I'm gonna say it anyways UFC is what UFC is because of Dana white you can sit there and talk about all these fighters and Yeah, but you know if it wasn't for this guy if it wasn't for that guy if it wasn't for what this person did and that Totally get it. Listen different players come and go right totally understand Dana has made it about the sport. He never made it about the fight. He never made it about one fighter He is very Quick to call out anybody. It doesn't matter if it's the number one guy in the league He'll call him out. John Jones. He'll call out Connor if he screws up, but he'll back him up To the highest level. He'll say that was some stupid shit. He did He'll sit there and straight up tell you what he likes what he doesn't like But everybody learned during covet. He was the number one commissioner in all of sports Every commissioner in america caved mba caved nfl caved mlb caved Every commissioner caved except for one guy who had brass balls called dano white who said I don't give a shit We're going to find a place to do the fight. So during covet. You know, it's the only sport the world watched We watched ufc. No one's watching the freaking football game with no fans out there and card boards What am I going to do with card boards? Oh, no, we're gonna watch Hey, you can buy this seat for your face to be on the you know Basketball game who gives a shit. It was the most boring finals lakers one ever They shouldn't even deserve to have won that finals. There was no audience. Nobody boon against you But everybody realized here's dano as a commissioner. Then it's everybody else. You're not at his level He's a wartime leader as well as a peacetime leader. He's learned how to balance both prestige moving together He said something in an interview says listen, man, maybe it's just the fact that I'm getting old And I'm getting soft, but I have a hard time seeing what's going on with some of these guys and You know In the way his personal life when he went through that crisis and the way he put it He says you want me to be embarrassed? How much more embarrassed you want me to be? You know how embarrassing it is to talk to my wife and my kids. You know how embarrassing that is This is nothing compared to embarrassing the two have to face my kids You respect that you love that there's a degree of clarity especially to dano that is very rare and I think that one of the things that ufc has done is make boxing particularly Feel so antiquated and pedestrian and the fact that ksi almost speed tommy fury. You know how bad that would have been for boxing That's not good. That's not good, but he ksi does not represent ufc either He doesn't but what would have happened if a youtuber would have beaten a professional boxer with the last name of fury It's humiliating correct and many people would have said he could have won on the points But what was it that you said you made some comparison about jockeys and horses to do with dano white? Yes, I made the analysis with ilan musk where you either bet on the oh the same goes with dano white as well Yeah, yeah, so you got the jockey and the horse. Okay You got dano white is the jockey the horses ufc ilan musk is a jockey Tesla is the horse. Okay, so if tomorrow ilan musk resigned from tesla to only do twitter What happens to tesla? It's going to be disturbing for a lot of investors because a lot of people bought tesla because it's ilan musk A lot of people are selling tesla Tesla and getting rid of their cars like aoc It's ilan musk ever since yeah about twitter double-edged sword. Yeah, it's a double-edged sword But you know to me in a perfect world is if you can have both I think ufc is a great product Phenomenal product addicting product. Okay viral product But dano white is an incredible jockey. Do you remember someone brought up? I think it was israel adesanya had been using the n word And it's at the press conference. I mean it must be fun for the press You know to sit down and dano sits down. He goes. All right guys. What's going on the gate tonight was We broke this he would have the fight of the night and then he just looks up and someone asks him a question And he just says what he thinks you know, he doesn't say something that the media team has prepped him on Although i'm sure he's got training and he understands the boundaries, but nothing feels prescribed manufactured Conceited Nothing Contrived nothing feels like that. It just feels like this is what the guy thinks Someone I saw this on the internet. Someone had talked about Many organizations and youtubers at the moment are trying to speed run authenticity Right. They're trying to growth hack relatability. How can I make myself seem more authentic and relatable than I actually am And obviously it's kind of a self-defeating prophecy Which is that the only way to be authentic is to be authentic And there's a degree of trust, you know, I mean dana dude the start of this year was rough for him that Him and his mrs. Got into a scuffle and it got videoed and it was maybe like new year's eve or something like oh January 1st. Guess I was starting 2023 the worst way possible and He comes out and you have faith that you go Yeah, this guy Meant what he said There's I don't think that there's any demons looking in the closet because I may Regret saying that at some point in future, but I don't think that I'm going to need to because I just have faith that I'm not a dana white. I don't have stock in dana white. I just I'm a good judge of character and I see in him someone That seems to tell the truth more often than not and seems to be very open and honest and own his mistakes And people love that people really really like that So, yeah, it makes him incredibly likable Authenticity at the highest level that brand is a very authentic brand He said is uh, you know his enemies. He's had the people that have challenged him and given him a hard time, but Dana in a in a past life could have been a gangster Maybe he was but he could have been a gangster. He could have ran a Family that's how Dana's he could have been he Dana is almost not a mob boss You know of a Gambino family or Genovese or colombo Dana's more the guy that ran the commission like a Luciano. That's Dana And to be that guy There is no book you can read to be that you can read 40 lots of power 100 times you can't be that guy You either are that guy. You're not that guy big boss energy Dana is that guy Dana's that guy One of your quotes is when you're winning you're not as good as you think you are When you're losing you're not as bad as you think you are. What's that mean to you? Both of them lie, you know, both of them is exaggerated, you know, both of them are When you when you're winning everybody's telling you how amazing you are. Oh my god, let me tell you do you You know what you're the best You're amazing You know, you're just better than that guy and you're better than this guy And it always takes me back to that quote of Marcus Aurelius who had a slave That would sit behind them and always whisper to him. Hey, you're just a man You're just a man. You're just a man. That's right 40 laws of power, right? You're just a man. You're just a man. You're just a man And then he would get up and he became the best emperor what 62 ad to 69 whatever the time is And he becomes who he becomes And we read about him now, you know, you pick up the book meditations. You're like, this is like mandatory reading for anybody What is this all about? Right? You know a simple book Not that big you can read it in one hour. No, it's not it's not And you're going through it saying what was this about then you google what did he mean by this? Wow, I don't think about it that way. So and then when you're losing Everybody tells you I told you shouldn't have done that. I knew you weren't gonna make it Yeah, I told you it wasn't for you. You weren't that guy and you believe that as well So both of them are are lying for me politically Politically, I'm a capitalist hardcore capitalist. I fully am a capitalist to the core I think the free market will create solutions to problems. I think the free market is going to filter out all the fakers in pharma in finance in podcasting in sports in real estate and insurance It takes two decades, but it'll filter people out. It's not it's got zero sympathy for you It doesn't care to be friend. You can give capitalism as many compliments as you want. He doesn't feel it. He has no emotions You can't flatter capitalism. All he's interested in is results. Are you good enough? Can you last can you recreate yourself? Great But when it comes on to politics, I want to hear both sides Okay, I'm a christian, but I held a podcast four weeks ago I brought two muslims and I brought two christians and I had them go at it for two hours discussion because my Conversation was more about okay if we agree on seven different things we disagree on seven different things But you agree on 23 different things. Can we figure out a way to make this work? Why do you feel the way you do? Why do you feel the way you do and they go back and forth and your sinners in okay? Interesting to date israel palestine with what's going on with hamas complicated lots of issues You know on one end the question is where pro israel Where folks are going back and forth You know, I'm a pro-israel guy. I'm from iran when I lived in iran for 10 years Iran was safer when reza pahlavi was there because they were strong and they had allies with everybody And israel was safe the middle east was safe you could go And say, you know what patrick next week, you know where i'm going. Where are you going? I'm going to tehran iran Because frank sinatra is performing there i'm gonna do a podcast with frank sinatra said you're doing a podcast with frank sinatra in tehran iran sick You would have been able to say that in 76 in 75 So the middle east was fairly peaceful not perfect, but it was peaceful But at the same time it you know, you got to ask the question Had it israel with the best Intelligence masad not know that for one year hamas was training for this How did you not know that they went and built a city similar to the one that you haven't trained on how to break into homes and take hostages? You didn't know that you really didn't know that And intelligence gave you a report from here from egypt But you didn't know that it's a fair question to ask but when you ask that question guess what people say What kind of a question is that this is not the time to ask that question. Do you realize what they're doing to kids? I don't support it I'm not supporting any of that stuff. Then I got another question because palestinian said that's exactly right This was intentional by israel. They know what I asked palestinians and they also don't ask this question Here's a question If you're so peaceful Who knows more about palestinians? us Who live in america or uk or your neighbor if you live in a condo or if you live in a house And you've been living in this house for five years or 10 years You have a neighbor on this side. You have a neighbor on this side You know when they do barbecues, you know, how much they drink You know who in which in-laws comes in, you know the son when he sneaks in the girlfriend at one o'clock in the morning You know the daughter when she sneaks out and changes her skirt and gets into a car with that bad boy and goes out and does What she does and she comes back at four o'clock. You know your neighbors. You see all their mess. Okay If if palestine In gazes filled with so many peaceful people. Why is egypt not taking them? As refugees to go to egypt egypt knows a lot about you. Why is it only 800 people? Why are they not letting a million people come to you? So somebody may say What a shameful question for you to ask. How dare you ask the question? I think both questions need to be asked What you do with it is up to you. Okay, so for me this whole concept of when you're winning Don't believe the hype when you're losing. Don't believe the hype Whatever story even your own side is saying. Why don't you be skeptical a little bit and question it for yourself and see if you can entertain both ideas I want to find ways to entertain both ideas as much as possible because I find myself becoming sharper when I do That and I eliminate blind spots anytime 100% one side have way too many blind spots. We'll get back to talking to patrick in one minute But first I need to tell you about fountain life. Here's a crazy statistic Nearly 70% of heart attacks occur without any Prior symptoms simply put the human body is really good at hiding disease and this is where fountain life comes in They provide top of the line health snapshots vetted therapeutics and a team of longevity physicians So that you can live a longer healthier and more vital life in seemingly healthy adults fountain life's initial results have shown 2% have cancer 2 and a half percent have a potential ruptured aneurysm looming in their future and over 14% have a critical life saving finding right now You can get the exact treatment that I got by going to the link in the description below or heading to fountain life Dot com slash modern wisdom using the form on that page to get $500 off their apex membership That's fountain life dot com Slash modern wisdom. Do you think that we're obliged to have a take on everything because I haven't Got involved in the israel palestine conflict and there's a lot of people that are very unhappy The silence is violence crowd your silence is deafening. Why haven't you come out in support or against this group or that group? Is it an obligation for us all to have a take on everything? If if the background has to do anything with you, I think you are obligated to talk about it Meaning if you're a jew, I think you have to if you're palestinian you have to If you're a muslim, I think you have to because it's your community. It's your pride. It's your background If you're a political show and you've spoken about ukraine and russia And you've touched that topic. Why are you not touching this topic now? I don't know if you have no no no no to all of the above then guess what that means then you're consistent So no you don't have to if you've been consistent with all of it. You don't have to talk about it That's not what the show is about you could simply say you want to hear that show go to ben Shapiro Well, what people are saying they're not saying why haven't you commented specifically what your position is what they want What they're saying is why haven't you said the thing that supports the stance that I want you to take for each of them No, why haven't I come in and done edit at all? I mean listen There there's a lot of events in the world that if you and I have to comment on all of them We don't have a life you would have to do 12 hour podcasts to cover everything on a daily basis. No But this is a Once in 50 years type of crisis that could lead to a world war three numbers came yesterday Were ray dalio, I don't know if you've sat down with ray dalio. Okay, so you know who ray dalio is He's a 20 billion dollar man built an incredible company I had him on as well ray dalio yesterday said The chance of world war three is officially at 50% and jayme diamond yesterday said These are the most dangerous times we're living in decades Okay, so one may say Well, you get tens of millions of eyeballs You're no longer somebody that gets Back in the days your first show when you did were 220 people watching a mom and dad didn't watch it Your siblings didn't watch your best friends didn't watch it. No now you're getting Well, that's the interesting question, right? Whether somebody with a sufficiently large platform is obligated to comment on things simply because they have a large platform And you ask why whether I haven't why I haven't if I haven't I found out about the incidents that were going on in the middle east on twitter Two days after they happened and I wondered why hammers was trending and I thought what the fuck's hammers. Oh, fuck. That's Hamas That was two days after everything had happened by this time I'd already had texts from people saying dude like Are you gonna get you're gonna do an episode on this and I was like bro The requisite amount of understanding for me to be able to add an educated opinion to this topic Is not one that I have time to do. I mentioned to you earlier on we've been traveling. We were in la We were there for two days all I did all I've done for the last week is travel Sleep research and record and I've researched very specific guests. I haven't been researching stuff about the middle east, right? So that's all I've had time to do Is it not the precise problem that people who do not know what they're talking about have given Cod psychology insights way outside of their domain of expertise and just added to the noise rather than adding to the signal And yet there is a group of people on the internet that would say no But this is so important to me that it's something that should move Aside the other things that you're doing in life. And I think a final element of this is people who are chronically online Cannot understand what it's like to not be chronically online I am chronically online for periods And then I am chronically traveling around and researching and recording and going from hotel to hotel coming out to florida This is one of those periods during which There's a lot of reading that needs to be done To make a comment to contribute to something that lots of people who are better educated than me can do It's the same reason I didn't comment on covid Covid was something that was happening. We did a a couple of Episodes explaining how we felt people could better work from home some mental health tools that we thought that they could use Some strategies that they could do to improve their time blocking and some stuff like that Here's how we would design your homework station. I'm like If you want me to comment and just throw horseshit at the wind I can do it, but I don't think that it's going to benefit anything. So yeah, there's this compulsion this obligation I think that uh certain groups on the internet feel Anybody that comments on things should get themselves involved with and uh, it's just are you surprised? No, no at all because what they want, but again, they don't want you to comment They want you to support their side. No, that's a different story that that that's a different story. There's a difference between commenting and supporting right I'm not if I comment i'm giving you my thoughts and i'm gonna share with you my uh, uh You know opinion Thoughts on my life experience on what I think is going on and then from there Agree or disagree for the people who are asking you to contribute if your thoughts and your life experience led you to Uh Implicate one side rather than the other sound like you were being more generous to one side rather than the other They would very quickly say I wanted you to comment, but I didn't want you to say that They would very quickly have an issue. Is that your brand though? Is your brand? Uh, uh of 700 episodes 2500 clips You know is your brand given opinion on current events? Have you done that in the past? Because here's what happens. So In the market, you know how in hollywood. They say this guy's a triple threat. What's a triple threat act sing dance Okay, in podcasting. There's also triple threats. Okay. What's a triple threat a great interviewer? Which you are but that's one of three two is perspective and opinion Which joe rogan is people want to hear what joe has to say about this And in three is entertain Can you entertain me while you're giving me your perspective or asking questions where i'm kind of like Man, I was funny as hell. Yeah. So joe the reason why joe is number one is because joe's great host We want to hear his perspective agree or disagree. He has the He has the conviction and the confidence to give a side and be willing to change. Hey one minute. You're voting for bernie sanders Four years later. You're saying to save america. You got to vote for trump and republican. What? What are you talking about? Right? So then three is he entertains you he makes you laugh Your brand You have to take the risk whether you want to go to two I don't think you need to comment on absolutely everything if joe was to be asked What do you think of aron roger's most recent achilles rupture? As you said earlier on that's not a but there's a different story with that You asked about consistency earlier on ukraine russia didn't comment on covet didn't comment on and that's your brand then But but by the way, what you just said is Your perspective absolutely, but it's a meta perspective on what's going on. You're not going to please everybody though Look, i'm armenian and assyrian. Okay, so now i was born in iran. So here's where i'm screwed i'm a half armenian half assyrian born in iran And i'm an american, okay So for the emulsmen of the apocalypse. Oh my god. So whenever something happens with armenian genocide I have to within a second comment on it. Okay And I do but now within a second because I don't have intel So when you're talking about your days what it looks like research all that stuff You're telling the truth But i'm running nine companies and I got a wife and I got four kids and i'm Transitioning with another company and i'm doing research on a podcast and i'm doing the interviews and i'm running a tech startup And i'm running a consulting firm with clients that are traveling worldwide to come to us And i'm doing our our best to kind of see what's going on with stories Yeah, there's going to be days you just don't have time and the audience Can't understand and cannot understand it right? That's a decision they got to make Uh, so assyrians. Hey, did you see what happened at that theater? What are you going to comment at this wedding that just took place and a hundred people were dead And a place caught on fire and these people. Okay, great. Let me get some intel and then i'll comment on it And then I did you know or iran or you know, but but the natural part where I would take it as a compliment is the audience is leaning on You to see how you would assess this issue and they trust the way you reason And nowadays there's not enough people who are able to reason To give a different perspective because they simply don't trust mainstream media But then the next step is do you want to take the risk of going in that side? If your brand is not on covet not on uh, ukraine not on this then you're staying consistent. I think largely the main Lesson I learned I learned this from douglas murray is that there are a lot of people in the online space Who do not have expertise within a particular domain and have it in another one They have expertise within psychology or climate change or whatever it might be and then they start thinking to themselves. Well Why Why shouldn't my thoughts on the ukraine be important to people? What everybody thinks that my insights about climate change are absolutely wonderful and they start to get out over the skis Outside of their domain of competence. If you want to talk about my domains of competence I'll comment on it For me, there are people out there who are Capable prepared to do the work have the time and have the expertise. I don't think that the internet needs more noise I think it needs more signal and I would be contributing nothing short of noise if I did that I'm also just not passionate about learning about this topic and I understand that in order for me to give the For me to meet the bar of evidence and insight that I would want to to feel proud about my opinion I need to be passionate about it. Right. I need to be compelled to learn about passion about life Of course I am Would you like to live 200 years old? Yes. Okay So do many of your listeners because the feedback you give Has to do with living a great life because people are watching the life you're living The only thing I would encourage you to consider from the audience side Is this is a different crisis This crisis If reasonable people like you can find a way to lower the overreaction that people are having With everything that's out there. I would say you would actually contribute to lowering the overreaction community so I'm I'm simply complimenting you to consider the fact that people are looking to see How a reasonable person like you that can give a logical perspective because that's what's missing today and When a Ray Dalio When a Jamie Dimon when many of these guys are saying 50 percent And you with your millions of people who listen to you can and it's not a Niche audience where it's in one country or two countries your audience is worldwide 100 plus countries. You got people listening to you I think maybe from that level the Feedback from the audience could be this is not a regular issue We'd like to hear your thoughts and then whether you choose to do it or not. It's your prerogative and we move on Yeah, you've got uh You mentioned there about this sort of loss of faith in our institutions Right the previous gatekeepers the people that we would have relied on to Tell us what what in the world? What do you think about this rising skepticism? Uh, there is also a degree of conspiratorial thinking heterodox cynicism around what we're being told Is this leaving a vacuum where people's uncertainty is making their lives worse? What is going to happen from a a sense making because how do people make sense of the world when we can't trust the information communicators Well, that's the that's why they want to hear from you. So so what you're saying is is validating their point. So in america today We are at the lowest levels. We've ever been for americans trusting mainstream media and trusting the government Not one or the others the lowest in both. We don't trust the government. We don't trust mainstream media The last time the the people trusted mainstream media and the government the highest was right before kennedy died after that That was at 72 percent. It's gone from 72 65 60 Down to today 27 percent people simply don't trust The mainstream media to get feedback on what's really taking place. There's a reason why rogan Gets more eyeballs on his show than all these guys combined and people are watching to see what he has to say There's a reason why shepiro gets the eyeballs. He gets there's a reason why you get the eyeballs There's a reason why all these other guys get the eyeballs Is because they want to hear a different perspective, you know, we're going back to The the the story where you know in this quote's been criticized many times. It's not really true You know amateurs build You know professionals build the titanic amateurs build the arc, you know, this whole story that they go back and forth professionals run mainstream media amateurs run podcasting But the world is trusting amateurs running podcasting more than the people that build the titanic because a lot of people think mainstream media is about to Sink like the titanic dick now whether it did or not who knows but People want to talk to somebody just a regular guy says, you know, what's your story? What do you think about this? What are your thoughts on this? Do you really agree? Do I does anybody else feel I kind of feel that way as well? I'm a little bit skeptical. I'm a little bit worried about this. What's going on? Is it really as big as they make it out to be should I trust these guys? So I'm not surprised this is taking place. By the way, you know, what's the Only thing that's keeping mainstream media in business. It's only a couple things that keep in mainstream medium business number one is 75 year olds 70 75 year olds are keeping mainstream media in business. Okay, so that's another 10 to 15 years Before that generation is no longer here. That audience is gone. Number two is big pharma if Two countries in the world that allow big pharma companies to advertise it's us and new zealand every other country in the world You cannot advertise The only two countries in the world where pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer That can advertise is us and new zealand everywhere else. There is no commercials on tv Do you realize what would happen if a president? Did an executive order got congress everybody in it to say moving forward big pharma can no longer advertise on mainstream media You know what happens the next day Every one of them goes out of business And all these talented guys at espn or at cnn or fox or abc that are getting the 5 10 15 20 million dollar contract gone 80 percent of revenue is gone And a lot of these guys now have to go and try to make it in the world that you're making it And this is what you're doing is hard. There's not a teleprompter behind me There's nobody whispering in your ears what to say follow up with this question. This is all you doing it, right to them Hey, ask him this follow up with this. We just found data 63 percent. He's lying follow up with this Did you watch any of the late night hosts when they tried to do a podcast between them? Yes What did you think from a professional's perspective a amateur professional's perspective? There's a reason why they can't do anything without writers You know, I mean don't get me wrong to me fallon is a very talented guy a very talented guy And you're not going to get to that job without having talent these guys got a lot of talent They're workers, but the moment writers are done. You mean to tell me for may 12th You guys can't do an episode until what october which they just started with two weeks ago You realize writers control this world now the writers are worried that chat gbt can write the Jokes of what's going on and what if a i can pop out these, you know Jokes and what could take place no this game is a very very hard game. This is not an easy game Think about what spot if I did What other president in the last 20 years has been as popular as obama And let me get this straight obama and another guy named bruce springsteen start a podcast and spot if I drop some what? Who else has been more popular in the last 20 years on television than kim kardash in with 300 million followers on instagram Spotify signs a podcast with her then they drop her what? Who else has been more on tv and every magazine newspaper than harry and megan But spot if I drop their podcast and hasn't Fully is like we're not renewing the contract and then they give rogan a few hundred wait what? So let me get this straight just being famous doesn't help to have a podcast. No wow I thought it was just about fame. No, this is hard. This is an art. This is very difficult to do It's not easy to do so if mainstream media Sinks like the titanic 90% of that talent is going to disappear and they're not going to know what to do 90% of them It's not an easy game. There's does this mean or does this contribute to? Complicity or those Commentators and all of the other people whose wages ultimately are paid for by those adverts Does this does this create a perverse incentive for them in what way that they may be Prepared to compromise something they truly think to not jeopardize the people that ultimately pay their wages That there is a risk to them saying something out of turn which may I mean are you really asking that question or you know the answer to that question? You already know the answer You're a smart guy. Yeah. No, of course they they they have to they don't have a choice to take that position, right? I'll give you an idea. Chris Cuomo was on cnn for god knows how many years and he was a number one guy for two or three years What does cnn do to chris? fired his brother andrew Cuomo governor fired And then he's got a hundred twenty five million dollar pending lawsuit against cnn and now cnn folks can't talk to chris. I had him on the podcast and For the longest time Cuomo was hated by a lot of people on the right Absolutely hated because of the stuff you would say where is jesus? Jesus going to come and save you with covet. What's jesus going to do for you and all this stuff you would say, right? well He came on a podcast And i'm with one of my partners in dalas. He's a billionaire himself in the insurance, but he's the number one power player in insurance We're at his uh, uh office corner office on the top one the sickest office you'll see in your life like 60 at floor He's overlooking all of dalas brine and he says You know, it's kind of weird watching Cuomo on your podcast. I said why? He says he sounded different You know those moments where I kind of liked him when I was watching this and this is not a guy I can say something like that with you know how many people said that What happened to him? He's now a free agent. He's got a shirt. He sells that's called free agent. He's got a podcast that says, you know You know With something Cuomo project that he's got a podcast and how does he dress like you? we're with him a couple weeks ago in uh, what do you call it in um sag harbor in uh, up in uh That entire area whatever that area is I forget the name uh, sagaponic sag harbor all that stuff And we'll go to his house. My kids are running on the back. He said pat somebody wants to talk to you I said, who's that facetime? It was like this like, oh shit What's up robert downey jr. How you doing? So i'm having a conversation with him But forget about talking to robert downey jr. I wanted to see my kids reaction, especially my two boys Because my boys when he died My kids were devastated When he dies iron man dies in you know in the do you know what today is in the marvel cinematic universe? Today is the canonical death day Of tony stark when he clicks his fingers today is the day the date get out of here today is the date I did not know that What is the chance of me bringing up the sword and I don't even know that story So I said dylan tico come here. So daddy will run around with the dogs. I said trust me Come here And chris turns the camera around he goes like this My son goes Oh my god Zion man, I know you and then the other son tico his reaction dylan's reaction You know, you love robert downey's one of those guys that you absolutely love when you go back to his journey I was talking about the movie that my dad and I watched 30 years ago only you And the only movie I've ever watched four hours two hours and two back to back in a row was judge This by robert downey jr. What's the moral of the story the moment chris coma was free And he didn't give a shit He just kind of told you what he was kind of going through Would you like it or not? You may not agree with everything, but he's finally free a lot of these guys working on mainstream media They're not free. I mean now see took his transition And guess what he's killing it. Okay Love them or hate them when tucker puts on a show Everybody's watching what this guy's got to say. So I found out from the guys that Light and tech all of this stuff that we're doing here who understand very very very closely what's going on Bennett was it anamorphic lenses? Is that what they shot took his first thing in his garage with? Yeah, so anamorphic lenses a very particular type of lens very particular type of shooting very Uh short wide so it has the Image of maybe it was his garage or something like that or a living room with the background behind him make no mistake that is lit and shot in Cinema quality right with the facade of it being a sort of low budget thing, right? So it's this beautiful on an iphone. Yeah, precisely. It's this beautiful blending of both and uh That's exciting. I think it's exciting to see what these guys do and also, you know, I love this about Given that we spend so much time talking and and people have this Uh concern about whether or not someone's gaming the system. Are they trying to growth hack relatability? Right or authenticity? Seeing I would be lying if I said that I didn't take an amount of pleasure to see late night hosts that have got massive platforms struggle to hold a conversation together for an hour over zoom because That is ultimately the battle place of ideas, right? It's not how well can you read a script from a teleprompter? I mean, there is skill absolutely skill in being able to do that and I couldn't I couldn't do the writing I couldn't do the performance. I couldn't do the bits and the blah blah the music but Largely you are a marionette, right? That's being ventriloquized by a handful of writers and and execs Ultimately seeing what you can do When the gloves are off is more interesting to me. This is very hard. This is this is very hard because How long is your average podcast? Hour and a half Okay So an hour and a half of keeping people's interests with no breaks and nobody talking to you and touching up the makeup to them What are you talking about? That is absolutely insane to do something like that. No This is very hard and the market is proven that this isn't for everybody The market is proven. You cannot keep my attention for that long. This is very very difficult when when people start to say and I remember I hired a marketing expert You know 13 years ago 14 years ago. He came in and said well studies. I've shown you're making one of the mistakes You're making on youtube your videos are about 12 minutes long And the only videos that do well is 12 minutes after 12 minutes that I said nah, man I'm doing 42 minutes 28 minutes hour and 20 minutes. That's a mistake Number one thing we have to do is no video can go past 13 minutes Like dude, okay, maybe this guy's the expert. He sold this company for a couple million. You know what happened the day we fired him 60 days later our first video goes viral and gets 40 million views today It's got a half a billion views. Okay for the life of an entrepreneur in 90 second takes off, right? And we start making other clips and other videos and other stuff and ec joe takes it to a whole different level Three hours and you got lex freedman takes it to a different level four hours three hours and 48 minutes You know, yeah, what lex does he did seven hours with balaji Glutton for punishment Yeah, you um you tweeted something that I thought was quite interesting You said why do so many people who come to the america from other countries with little to no money at all? within 10 years outpace the average person who was born here What is going on where americans who have all of the i'm an immigrant to this country, right? Many people who are given from the very beginning all of the benefits of being from this country Why is it that they are outpaced by people who weren't born here? so Six seven months ago I'm sitting with my state planner and one of the fears I have for the last 10 years is What i'm going to do with my kids with the wealth with money? Am I raising them in a way that they're not going to turn out being the You know the snobby arrogant kid that you know the spoon. Oh man, I cannot say I never liked those kids in school Those are the kids I got into fights, but I never liked those kids So I don't want to raise those types of kids and then you go and read these books about which families Generationally created a wealth that state like Vanderbilt raised a bunch of snobs So Vanderbilt's money only lasted one generation generation later. There's no money left So when you read the story about that anderson cooper's a Vanderbilt But his mother said even though we were Vanderbilt don't expect any kind of trust fund baby You ain't got no money here. Nothing's coming over till you got to make your money You know and but you look at the medici family and what they did five six seven generation What did they do differently? You look at Rockefeller still has the money You look at some of these other families that kept the money within the family What did they do? What did they structure and there's a state plan and we can go do, you know 10 15 20 50 thousand dollars then there's hot guys. You can hire. That's a hundred thousand quarter million a million dollars But those are state planners when you hire, you know what they do they interview your kids so they go sit down with your kids and After they talk to you and they'll say how do you want to set the stuff for the money with your kids? Who gets money? What do they need to do? What's the criteria or your gift to get this? What kind of cars do you now want them to buy to waste the money? Who do you want it to work for? What happens with this business? Can they lose all the money? Are you given equally? Here's what this family and they give you all these suggestions on how to properly set it up Once you and your wife agree on what you want to do with that wealth These guys have meetings with all your kids without you there And they'll record it so you can see how the meeting went went but they're setting it up with them So they'll say okay kids. This is uh On behalf of your parents, here's a few things you need to know number one Um, the good news is your parents are very prepared on what they've done with you And here's what you can get your parents have worked very hard And they have made a lot of money and if you do it, right? Some of that can be passed over to you But if you don't you're not going to get it either. Let me go through some of these criteria These three things you do you're not going to get anything these two things you do If you do this, here's what's going to happen. This is what they want to see use the money with And then they kind of break it down to them now You know how many families actually do that Very few those conversations most people don't have most people are so much about go go go go go go go go And then you die unexpectedly. Oh, we didn't set up the state planning let alone the detail the state planning. No Okay, now your kids are spoiled right and doing what they're doing. I've had this conversation with a number of friends Ben Francis who is the CEO of gymshark his net worth is triple drakes Um, he's the start of a guy by the way. He's a serious. I had him on the podcast a couple years ago start serious dude Yeah, uh, I was talking to him and I think that it's the same with you One of the things that you value the most in your upbringing have been the hard times the spit and sawdust Lessons and rules the hard school of hard knocks, right? That's given you the work rate that has permitted you to be able to achieve the success that you have and Reverse locally reverse entropy, right? So you've been able to wrangle your reality in a way that you want it to Mm-hmm. And yet You have worked so hard to be able to give your kids Opportunities that you never had. Mm-hmm. And yet, you know that they need to go through the hardships And that those are where the lessons are learned that are going to bear them. This to me seems like a very Uh, interesting tension, right? I want to give my kids opportunities that I've worked so hard for if I don't What the fuck was the point in you working so hard, right? And yet they need to go through the difficulty They need to do how have you found this tension between the two? Well, that's a great question But I want to finalize by making a point when you ask the question about Why is it that so many people come to america within 10 years to have more money than the people that were born in america? because unfortunately The way we've ran america if the american-born kids Are kids of these families? They're the kids of the families that spoiled them in america There's no more earning things in america. It's just handed out to them. We're printing money left and right We're giving away income to people left and right. We're making life easier We're incentivizing the wrong things. Do you know in 1940 in america what percentage of kids were born to single mothers in 1940? in america What percentage of kids were born to a single mother who's not married with no father in the household? 4% is the number. Did you know the number or no? It's 4%. You know what that number is today? Over 50 It's over 40 shy of 50 percent. You're right there at the number You mean to tell me we went from 1944 percent to today. So what happened there? first of all policies by fdr Social security and incentives of taking care of single mothers then linden johnson in 1965 took it to a whole different level Mothers are sitting there saying the more kids I have the more entitled programs. I get great. Why would I get married? If I get married, I lose those benefits The incentive programs america set up Totally screwed everything up. It incentivized the bad behaviors like telling a kid Can you imagine if you're in estate planning you say for every kid you have not married? I'll pay you 700 dollars Whose fault is that parents fault? Bad policies have consequences. Yeah, you create a bad policies What person in the right state of mind? When they have their wealth america's a family. It's a corporation What person in the right mind would incentivize what parents would incentivize kids to say i'm gonna have more kids And i'm gonna give you money out of the living trust nobody in the right mind would do that But america did so what happened to us now we got all this crime Now we're paying the price for it because all these years there's no father in there to Put him in their place to challenge him to straighten them up. That's not in place You know, so that is a missing piece that these kids Don't have in america So to me if we looked at america as a family as a corporation estate planning matters You know living trust matters the right policies matters Listen, I even think to the point where you know how in america voting starts at 18 years old I would much rather this was a very Strange policy i'm gonna share with you when I posted this on on youtube a lot of people very upset with me I would much rather Have somebody who's 14 and a half years old Who's had a job? And paid a thousand dollars in taxes vote Then a 28 year old kid who's never had a job Never paid taxes. I don't want that guy to vote. Why? Because he contributed to society the 14 and a half year old kid the 15 year old kid contributed to society And realized how hard it is to pay the taxes into Whatever they're spending money on you want to spend a hundred billion dollars to Ukraine we could have built 20 walls We could have built 20 walls with that money that was sent you're not saying ukraine. I'm saying this so you're safe Don't worry. They're not they're not gonna come after you. They're gonna come after me So all of these things that you look at we're going away from earning When a immigrant comes here All they're looking at saying wait a minute. I can go work this and do this and do this and do this and i'm gonna earn this Yes, i'm going i'm going town all day. I'm good with this Many americans don't have that mindset because bad policies have consequences that we're suffering Uh, uh the negative impact of that but you ask the follow-up question Right with kids and your question is how to balance it with Challenge in them yet still having the opportunity. What was the question you were asking? Yeah, the tension between you affording your kids the benefits that all of your hard workers Allow them to do and some greetings. I'm very greedy and here's what i mean by i'm very greedy I want my kids As close to me for the rest of my life We have a family that lives in our community Uh message just bought a house right next to our house and he just moved into the community He caused a lot of mayhem. It's all over the place cops are coming in every week We have you know, what do you call it paparazzi craziness that's going on But one of the families that lives in our community they they run a medical company with six seven thousand employees So the the founders the mom and dad their house is here Right next door to the house They have two sons the other son lives here. Who's the chief marketing officer? They're all the son's house is here Each son has four kids Each son has four kids Both sons are doctors both sons married someone who's a doctor and they each have four kids They have a structure on what they do monday nights every tuesday night They have dinner together and they talk about god everyone's there's a system to everything they do He'll call me and say hey, we went fishing this morning. I got a bunch of fish. Can I drop it off to you? I am enamored by how those parents created that kind of a structure where their kids are respectful Their grandkids are respectful go on a halloween. We're walking in halloween doing trick or treating and The Son comes by 17 year old son comes by and he says yeah, he doesn't have his iphone with him I said, how does he know it not have it not have his iphone with him? He says in our family standard It's very easy. You want your phone you got to have straight a's he's got to be I said, well, let me get to straight your 17 year old son doesn't have a phone because he doesn't have one Because he has one because yeah, it's our standard I said, what are you talking about? This is very simple. You just got to make sure you got straight a's You'll get a phone you get the car you get this Now somebody's going to listen to this and say what what a freaking extreme set of standards. That's tyranny. That's tyranny That's exactly the type of kids that end up becoming da da da. No problem. It's called standards and expectations And for a family who has the ability To use money and waste it and do whatever they want to keep that kind of standards I respect that even more and guess what the son loves his father Loves his mother loves their grandparents respectful kids So it's it's not easy to do But if it matters to you eventually in my life when I say I'm greedy I would love to create a proposition for my kids. We're 20 years from now. They want to run one of the companies I want to be within the company They want to work with one of the companies and I like them to live close to me. Will it happen It's going to take us 30 years to find out because dude pan generational housing. I'm seeing it in austin, right? Commune or ranch where someone's buying up a ton of land and then there's another one of those puppies down there If you want to they're buying up a ton of land and we're going to not just have us We're going to have somebody else come and live with us as well We're going to have grandma and grandpa and they're going to be that this is the way that it was This is the way that it was and here's another thing to consider, right? Would you rather have drinking too? Going to do anything to me or no, what's you're going to survive? You're going to be dialed in you're going to survive. I promise Whatever whatever the internet throws at you. You'll survive. So What is the uh Yeah, so we've got that's citrus that one's orange one sunrise. Okay, yeah wild citrus so One of the interesting questions that you have here would be Would you rather have a parent who pities you more than they believe in you? You didn't do well. It's okay. That teacher doesn't understand Let me pat you on the back come here little timmy will take you for ice cream Or would you rather have a parent who says I believe in you more than more than I pity you I mean look, I'll tell you my dad very annoying man. Okay because Never sympathized never felt sorry for anything Never it was always stands on expectation, but he always loved me So when I was six years old and my teacher asked me what do you want to be when you grow up? I said I want to be a father. Why I said because I want to be like my dad I had a very good dad. My dad's still with us. He was in a hospital this week, but he's out. He's doing good. He's at the house Kids love him. Everybody loves him. My kids all have a relationship with him. He's 81 years old It took a lot to please my dad my dad wasn't impressed by anything He wouldn't be there and say, oh my gosh And by the way, he's a middle eastern father, which means I've never played catch with the guy We've never thrown the football. We never played anything. No sport. Why why he just he was a worker since eighth grade He dropped out in iran and started working to take care of his mom and dad. Their family was very very close You know, but again, remember how earlier on when we're talking about, you know, choosing your enemies wisely We talked about how the the top performers have a Person that gave him unconditional love and one that brought a lot of pain and then they chose their enemies wisely I think The role of a person that is gentle And another one that nothing's ever good enough is a great combination I think if both parents are gentle, that's a problem and I also think if both Parents are nothing's ever good enough is also a problem. Yeah, I think you need a little bit There's a reason why the creator god Created the dynamics that he created You know, I have a one of our guys we're spending our photographers with us And he's holding his daughter while we're doing a photo shoot this Saturday And she keeps asking for mom She keeps asking I said she's she daddy's girl. Oh, it's just now. It's all mommy I said, when does she want you whenever she's scared? She comes to me So the kid runs to daddy when she's scared but goes to mommy when she's hurt That's your interesting dynamic. How it is she feels safer By dad when there's a risk But feel safer by mom when she's hurt because she's gonna be pampered and taking care of it. Yeah I think that's very healthy combination. There was a quarterback bread far many years ago I don't know if you know, bear bread far. He's a famous texture. That's an inside joke if you know who he is but He has his quarterback He has his coach so tough on him So tough on him. Nothing was ever good with this quarterback kicking his ass Talking shit to him in the sideline. How could you throw that interception? What the fuck was that all about? What was that all about and he's afraid of the coach and he's always escaping the coach But there was a guy that was I think his name was mariochi stave mariochi And he would always put his arm around and listen. He believes in you. Why don't you prove him right? Deep down inside. He believes in you go through the past that you know, he knows he can throw Show him exactly what we got. Let's go win this game for him. Let's go So that dynamic worked incredibly well for bread far as well as many other players out there So I think You know one without the other is a problem if you got both. It's a great combination Yeah, there's a lot of problems with fatherlessness in homes Melissa carney just wrote a new book called the two parent advantage Two parent privilege. Sorry and uh, dude, it's terrifying just the raw data the raw outcomes that you get Your mom and dad stay together. Yes. Okay. Uh, we till today. Yep only child So only child only child. Do you have the only child uh syndrome? Yes. What do you mean? The guy that's the center of all of these lights and stuff In some regards, okay in some regards. Yes, but I think I had quite a stern upbringing I was held to incredibly high standards. Uh, it was very non-rebellious as a kid. Um, non-rebellious very non-rebellious Very very non-rebellious. Um, you know, wasn't going out wasn't sneaking out I don't think I ever got grounded once the god play role or no Standards and expectation was a tough standard high very high. What did your mom and dad do? Dad is an engineer mom stopped working for probably 10 to 12 years to raise me while dad was out working Uh, but this isn't you know, dad was on the working class of most working class We live in a a city in the uk that was famous only for having the highest teen pregnancy rating in the uk And then it lost that so it didn't even have that as a as a title anymore at least you could brag about it Now we got nothing to talk about. Yeah, we haven't even got that. Yeah, uh, so But it was it was very formative and you know, I'm just thinking more and more About this tension between success making people soft Uh, I spoke to David Goggins about it on the podcast, you know, he's this guy who can command Millions of dollars for speaking gigs and he's choosing to go smoke jumping. Have you seen this thing that he's doing? So smoke jumping is when there's a wildfire in the middle of nowhere and they need to air drop in The firefighters so they parachute in with a Pack around their waist with all their stuff on and they also put water huge Water bucket things that they'll attach their hoses to separately parachute them in and they just live in the fire Until they put it out. Sometimes they're out there for a week pretty sure he makes It's either seven or twelve dollars an hour That he makes for doing this smoke jumping as it's called. It's in canada for the most part Instead of going and doing this speaking to it and I asked him about success making you soft He says I see it way too much and that's why I don't like it. I'm not about the flash I'm not about any of that when the best books in business Was written by a legend see legendary ceo in silicon valley Who ran intel? I think he's the only guy that for a decade straight He grew the company a hundred percent every year unheard of what this guy did and the growth hungarian guy Okay, you know what the book's title is only the paranoid survive Only the paranoid say that before so I had a question to you around only the paranoid survive I don't disagree That paranoia is an unbelievable competitive advantage. It's a very useful performance enhancer, right? You are paying more attention. You are more detail oriented. You're more fearful all the rest of it Ultimately, is it worth it? Do you think is paranoia worth it as a life strategy? It the you are protected by those who take that seriously Okay, you know burden is not something that's a sexy sell You know, there's a lot of things that you and I can sell that's very sexy Okay, work from home very sexy yet the loneliness epidemic in america right now is record breaking numbers we've never seen before right on What people are doing how lonely they are numbers on depression is off the charts right now compared to what it was just 10 years ago So Yeah, you can sell work from home. You can sell three and a half day work week. You can sell Laptop entrepreneur. You can sell These are all sexy things to sell right you can sell Set up a funnel and make 20 grand a month and don't have to do anything These are all very interesting easy things to sell try selling burden go ahead and sell burden Oh, dude of the incredible honor of having burden of the responsibility of a nation or a state or a military or freedom I thought was a Try selling it. It's no, but it's not an easy sale. It's a hard sale. Responsibility isn't sexy So why are so many great leaders turned on by that burden? Why because someone's got to do it So it all depends, you know In the in the book your next five moves I talk about how The most important question you got to answer in life is Who do you want to be? What type of life do you want to live? That's simple. Okay, so what does this mean? Do you want to be a founder? Yeah, you sure? Yeah Positive I think so it's kind of cool right want to be a founder entrepreneur You sure you want to be a founder? You sure you want to be the number one guy? Tom Ellsworth who is my business partner said one the best things to me this guy was at Talk about the legendary interview of all time. It's the last interview of steve jobs and bill gates in silicon valley Okay, wherever it was 300 people were invited at this meeting tom was one of them said recorded. It's record. You got to see it By the way sick. It's the red chair when you see the red chair. You're watching the right one steve jobs is super skinny Tom Ellsworth tells me says pat it took me 50 years to realize I don't make a lot of money when i'm the number one guy The most money I ever made Is when I was number two through number six Think about saying that I think about taking 52 years to realize 50 years to realize the most money you ever made Was when you were the number two guy or number six guy? Because there's burden with number one Number one has got to sell the dream Number one has got to sell the vision Number one has got to seem like even though we're about to go out of business They're at peace. They're calm. They carry the burden sleepless nights Your finances you can't reveal to people if you're about to run out of money. We're gonna make the expenses We're gonna make salaries. We're gonna pay payroll. That's the number one person who wants that burden. Nobody wants that burden So no if the idea is to sell that No, it is not an easy sale but if you want to know why you right now are here And we are able to do this podcast at a Pretty unstable time in the world today It's probably because around 500 people Have the burden of making sure nobody messes with you and I where we are right now And those 500 people have A thousand people underneath them or 500 people underneath them why you and I are able to sit here So it's not the most sexy attractive thing like in in smithsonian. I don't know if you've been to the smithsonian in dc There's a part where you go and it shows You walk this way. It shows how lincoln aged over It's an incredible thing to see and there's a quote they buy by lincoln about burden Okay, the the being a president is the greatest burden A person can never have right some some quote like that. I'm paraphrasing So it's not for everybody and it's not a sale the person chooses to do it Obama before and after His eight years right. He still looks good though. Oh, he's still got he's still got swagger But I mean that was 20 years in eight years. That's right So this is something I wanted to talk about you have spent a lot of time reading about and researching and speaking to powerful people Who do you think really runs the world? You're gonna go there, huh with the question. Who do I think runs the world? Um So I used to ask the question I said who who's got the most power in america? Is it congress is a president is it the CEOs of virtual governments? We're talking google twitter facebook You know those guys amazon, you know, or is it billionaires? Okay, you know the most richest man in the world. Who's got the most power and you'd be amazed how few people said president Does it come and go? You know the famous quote with putin that he says, you know American presidents you don't have to worry about it. They're gonna be there four to eight years Some suits are running, you know and run the country behind closed doors And he's got a very good point when he says something like that putin but to me There are a lot of Alliances being built so if you and I were to think about aspirational type of people, okay, you know how they say You know, well michael jackson eventually got to a point where he got so many different girls that he started trying with this And he started trying with this and a lot of these people in hollywood have so much sex with so many different people That they become creative and they do dumb things, right? Okay Tiger woods the reason why he got these girls because what do you know? What it is to be the greatest golf golf in the world and everybody throws their panties at you You want to judge a guy like that? Why don't you go be the greatest golfer and see what it feels like to be one out of eight billion? You don't know what it's like. So they're kind of trying and experimenting with all this stuff, right? It's almost like i'm so much in a prison jail. Everybody's watching what i'm doing I'm going to break the rules a little bit to see what i'm capable of doing. Okay So so let's go process and dissect some of these guys that make all the money in the world. Okay, you become a billionaire And you're still dangerously ambitious not from a good place, but more selfish place Okay, you took over an industry now you're worth five billion dollars Now you were 10 if you're a billionaire, you're the best at what you do in your space for the most part or you help build The best in that space for the most part. Okay cool, so Maybe your marriage didn't work out. Maybe you're not the best father in the world And you're like, well I want more control. I want more power I can't be a president I don't want to be a president because if I run for president They're gonna reveal the things that i've done in my life and god forbid if that gets all the light I don't want that that's embarrassing But you know what i'm gonna do? What if I can take over the world? Are there other people like me that are driven by wanting to take over the world? What if we could make the world one place and we make all the decisions for everybody because I'm probably one the smartest people in the world I'm proud and you know that conversation is taking place again You really start having that godlike figure like I don't know if you're familiar with george soros You know in one of the interviews he gave to la times. He says I always fancied myself would be in a god I fancied myself would be in a god This is an la times interview 20 plus years ago if you type in george soros la times god It's the most disturbing interview to read about this guy a lot of people are very skeptical about him Right, he's like the boogie man of a number of conspiracies. How many how many people have you heard say? I always fancied myself with being a god he says but What's great about where i'm at right now is it's no longer a Dream it became a reality I have a friend who has spent a lot of time with Super super powerful people and he told me about a meeting that he had with one individual In particular who spoke about being an apex predator He said that apex predators don't care about prey and even though The prey that he was referring to was still his own species It was really haunting the story the way that that was told to me because you had someone who not only Had the motivation to be able to go and enact whatever nefarious malicious plan But also had the actual resources to be able to go and do it right those two things together are They're scary and that was something that really opened my eyes I'm very non conspiratorial in the way that I think I always lean toward You know do not attribute to malice that which can be explained by stupidity Do not attribute to coordination that which can be explained by coincidence Uh And yet the more that I read and the more that I learn about things The more there there seems to be there right Yeah, you know people are offended by different things Some people being offended in their deepest insecurities They're willing to use their ambitions to go to certain levels That at that point they're not Thinking about the consequences of ruining a lot of people's lives. That's not something they're thinking about at that level. So Hitler was offended when you read my comb for you study what Hitler did. He was simply offended Somebody offended him. So his entire life was about doing what he did just because he was offended Now most people who are offended they do what they forget about it And they move on some of these guys want control some of these guys Want to make decisions for you some of these guys on the money side at least they go and make money to get power Some people don't go make money to get power. Some people cloud swab. They're like no, I'm not going to go make money to get power I'm going to get power by creating laws and thinking. I know what's best for you So there's a lot of different people that you can put in these steps of organization You just have to think like if you were to think about The commission of the mop always go back to it. Lucky Luciano created a commission with the five families He was the one that ran the commission right up the five families. Okay When you think about what meetings in the world happens where all the powerful people show up you get the g20 You got the un you got the world economy. You got davos. You got all these guys that come together You got nato you got So nato could be like well nato's Original when the 12 or 14 countries were part of nato. What was it really all about to fight ussr? There is no ussr. Why are we still funding it? What's the outcome now? Are we still fighting communism? So what a lot of people might say is that those organizations are So obvious that they can't be the ones where the real shit's happening, right? That's just the smoke screen the real shit is the shit that's behind it and the shit that's behind that and so on and so forth In your opinion, do you think that nato wef who that's those people there's no Further upset of strings that are playing the ventriloquized game behind those ones. Do you think that that's where a lot of power actually lies? um I don't know what I will say listen to you is with the questions you're asking I think There's a reason why the audience wants to hear what you think about what's going on right now because you're asking some heavy questions Right now, which means you're curious and if i'm the audience I would like to know what you can come up with if you took a deeper dive and really wanted to get into these types of you know informations but you know Think about what things people are most addicted to Okay, addictive personalities video games porn sex cocaine ecstasy weed steroids party in all of that stuff But what's one of the most addicting things? That many of those guys can't get power Are you kidding me power is like power porn The porn of having a lot of power And getting the look and people that look at you that are afraid of you some people love that Some people love that you know the quote like if you really want to test someone's character given power. I mean some people really Love having power take a company and see some of the guys that they hired they hired a wrong person at the top The guy was all driven by power. What happens? Take a president that becomes a president and he realizes he can use the justice system against his opponent. What happens? They got that power. It's a lot of power to give to somebody, right? um Yeah, so you know those people I believe are out there some of them are 100 money people because money talks and you can have a lot of you need funds to do anything, right? You do it's it's going to be the money people um But there's also the other power players behind closed doors that you know in the in the movie money ball Uh, Jonah Hill plays that. I don't know if i'm saying his name correctly. He plays the role of the guy that Brad Pitt is sitting there saying Why is this gm of cleveland indians keeps looking at the guy? Doesn't gotten based who the hell are you right in john john maxwell or or Dale Carnegie wrote about this in a book saying the law of e.f. Hutton E.f. Hutton was in the room that every time the guy was making a decision He wouldn't make a decision until he asked about e.f. Hutton So here's what we're going to do. So what's your proposal? Okay, great Hey, e.f. Hutton, what do you think about it? Okay, we're not going to be doing it great The world is filled with like henry kissinger. I don't know how much you know about henry kissinger That guy's an e.f. Hutton if there ever was one There's a lot of those guys that Are the brains behind the faces that we see and most of the times the best e.f. Hutton's No one ever finds out who they were No one ever finds out who those guys are one of the other tensions that I felt when Learning about you and also when watching your content You've spoken about this specifically to do with kobe But I think it also probably plays a role in almost everybody's life is this tension between self love and high standards Right, it's the desire to maximize everything you can and to not leave More on the table than you need to and also the ability to enjoy the moment and to be able to actually take some some pleasure in that And there was a something that came up from a friend that I wrote about this week So I wanted to explain this to you He did a psilocybin journey in Australia and a question came to him and the question was do people love you for who you are or for what you do This is uncomfortable to consider People loving us for who we are feels more real genuine caring empathetic and robust It feels like we're less fickle and more difficult to lose On the other hand people loving us for what we do feels transactional and transient The love that we receive becomes contingent on what achievements and successes we can offer in return And the obvious fear is that if a point came where we no longer had anything to offer in return Would our love be taken away? So here's an even more uncomfortable question Do you love you for who you are or for what you do? This highlights our hypocrisy You see we want the world to love us for who we are a balanced caring view of our true value independent of our accomplishments Meanwhile, our own self-love is largely determined by what we do If we fall short even though we know we tried our best We still castigate ourselves for being insufficient, unworthy creatures So we want the world to show up for us in a way that we are often not prepared to show up for ourselves You demand more than this demanded of yourself powerful Do you see that resonating this tension in high performers desire for more requirement for self-love? Yes, but for me There's a part of it. That's also honest Because again the relationship with between a man and a prostitute What is that relationship? Each side is getting something in return The prostitute is getting what? Money, what's the man getting pleasure? Okay, and they walk away. It's done. It's a very honest relationship, right? There's no depth in that relationship. It's straight up. It's honest done. We move on. Okay Working at a company Say you work with a company And he helps the youtube channel go to the next level doing all the work behind closed doors all this stuff Would he do that job for free? Or would he do it because you're offering something back to them? How many of my employees would be with me? If it was working for free That non-profit would be kind of weird guys. What we're doing is very important, but I need you to work for free What do you mean? Are you gonna make money? I am but I want you to work for free. It's kind of weird, right? There needs to be an exchange again. It's honest exchange, okay Um If I go above and beyond everybody else and I work should I deserve the right to get paid more? Yes, okay. Is it beneficial for me to work with somebody like you? Of course, why because you're driven So should I hang on to your co-tail because if I go with you big things are gonna happen in my life? Absolutely Is that a selfish decision? Yes, but it's also a wise decision. Do you know that you know that do they know that they know that Do they also know that you have options because now you're at a point that a lot of people would love to be working for you Of course, they know that they're not dummies, right? They know that Okay, but you still choose to stay with them and they still choose to choose to stay with you Is there benefit of somebody hiring your person that's helping with your podcast and paying twice as you pay to go with them? there is If he chooses to take that Just for the money. That's his loss If you're doing your part, he was never in it for believing in you. It was only about the money part So these are all and the reason why this is so interesting what what you're reading about self-love and all these other things Is when you look at some of the people that make it at the highest of the highest of the highest level They typically have been backstabbed so much That in the back of their mind, sometimes they're just waiting to see who's going to backstab next So so the desire to have a straight up relationship is no longer the same. Okay There's a difference between you dating somebody who falls in love with you And you're making 22 bucks an hour working at ballies And she loves you and she stays with you. There's a difference between you getting married when you're making $300,000 a year And then there's a difference between you making marrying somebody when you work half a billion dollars How do you know the girl that marries you at the end is worth? You know is with you because She loves you versus she loves what you offer them, right? And is that a sin? Yeah, is she making a mistake? You know I think in an ideal world I am very comfortable knowing that other people are also there in your life to get what they can out of you I'm very comfortable with that Because there's a chapter in the book here Where I talk about choosing running mates and I put a clear criteria on how to choose a running mate You know what they bring to the table their level of trust with you All these ways of scoring people in your life to see hey Is this a person because the whole concept would choose a new enemies wisely also need to choose your allies wisely So somebody like you you need true believers in your life. You can't have 50 true believers That's just naive to think that you can't have 10 true believers Can you have two to five true believers? Yes. How how valuable is that a lot? So No, I uh, you know the more and more I moved up The more I realized almost everybody like and I'm talking 99 percent of people Listen to the radio show wiifm. What's in it for me? and A part in this book that we dissected your question, which is fascinating question is In in the company. I've been running a sales organization for 20 something years And when I started the insurance company in online, we grew it from 66 agents today. We have 50 000 agents We've licensed nationwide. We have a few hundred offices nationwide but my Idea of looking at who's got the biggest upside to contribute to the company has also changed It used to be men that guy so selfish All that guy cares about money. I mean this guy's the nicest guy in the world and then I realized the nicest guy in the world Who had no selfish desires Was happy making five thousand dollars a month And so then I created a scoring system What percentage of you is selfish and selfless and what's the good balance? If you're a hundred percent only you And everybody else zero well, guess what you're still a bigger net positive to society than the person at the bottom That's what zero percent selfish and a hundred percent selfless if a person is a hundred percent selfless They probably don't eat well. They probably out of shape. They're probably not healthy They're probably gonna have to go to the hospital. It's gonna cost you money and taxes They probably smell because they don't take a shower. They spend their money on everybody else So then you'll see the profile Good people to give you counsel or around the 50 50 range. You can always trust them to give you counsel Drivers of a company or somebody like you doing what they do 70 30 is a good split Okay, 80 20 is a little bit problematic Because 80 20 sometimes will compromise to beat everybody. So you want the 65 70 so so you're asking a technical question and I've just come to a conclusion that you know Both parties if they want to selfishly be pleased if we can please each other And one of us takes the lead and we're getting mutual love and benefits out of the relationship You're in a good situation every once in a while you'll find somebody that's going to be a writer that they're going to say chris Dude, no matter what you do and with you till the day you die and you think they're telling the truth A year goes by they're still there even more Five years go by they got married like one wing and money gets married and ask you it's going to change Still there 10 years later still there you're like this guy's really a true believer. Wow But it's not going to be that many people. That's a very short list of people Patrick bet David ladies and gentlemen Patrick. I appreciate the hell out of you.
