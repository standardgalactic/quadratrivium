1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
Just how triggering are our phones when it comes to dopamine?

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:10,400
Okay, great question. We often hear that social media getting dopamine hit after dopamine hit.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,400
When we first get on social media for the first time or after a long period of time,

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,800
the amount of dopamine that's released we think is quite substantial. It's novel. Remember,

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,240
dopamine is about novelty, surprise, and the sense that we are on some exciting track.

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,800
That's what dopamine is really about. It puts us into states of readiness, anticipation, looking,

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,080
seeking, et cetera, almost always for things outside the confines of our skin. Just to contrast it,

8
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:41,200
maybe for a bit more of a future discussion, serotonin does the opposite. When there's a lot

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,080
of serotonin in our brain and body, typically it makes us feel satisfied, sated, and more quiescent,

10
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,280
comfortable with what we have in our own immediate sphere and within us. The comfort of a good meal,

11
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,840
the food you have, dopamine is about go, go, go. If you look at somebody who's high on cocaine or

12
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,880
methamphetamine, it's all about pursuit because that's a very dopaminergic drug. You look at somebody

13
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:05,360
who's taken a drug, and I'm not suggesting people do this, but it really ramps up serotonin. Let's

14
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,040
say a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, prozaxol, et cetera. The side effects of those drugs,

15
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,960
if the dosages are too high, lack of appetite, lack of libido, kind of meh about life,

16
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,120
then so they'll adjust the dose down. That's because those are serotonergic drugs.

17
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:29,040
So in general, when we are in pursuit of things, dopamine is quite high.

18
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,680
Now you have to remind me your question because I've set up the dopamine serotonin

19
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:40,720
parallel cell phones. Yes, forgive me. So the thing about cell phones is when you first get on

20
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,720
there and you have no Wi-Fi on the flight or something and you land, it can actually be quite

21
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,840
stimulating. You get a lot of dopamine. Oh, there's this. Oh, there's that. But very quickly,

22
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,200
when you're scrolling on social media, you're no longer getting the novelty, but you're continuing

23
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,200
to do it and you almost don't know why you're doing it. At that point, it shifts over to something

24
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,400
that's a bit more like an obsessive compulsive behavior, where we can define an obsessive

25
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,560
compulsive behavior where the obsession leads to a compulsion. So the obsession is a thought,

26
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,000
the compulsion is a behavior, but the acting out of the compulsion merely serves to increase

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,120
the obsession. This is very different than being obsessed with food or obsessed with cleanliness.

28
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,840
There's no payoff. Right, exactly. There's no anxiety relief by carrying out the compulsion.

29
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:32,720
With OCD behaviors, like scrolling social media, the dopamine quickly wanes and then you find that

30
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,480
you're just sort of, and we've all been there, you're scrolling and like, why am I doing this?

31
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,440
This isn't that interesting. This isn't that interesting. Now, the algorithms for social

32
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,760
media are very clever. And I don't want to demonize it. I provide a lot of, a lot of my life

33
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:53,760
has spent on social media now, but the algorithms that they've incorporated function on the most

34
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:00,880
powerful way to keep people doing a behavior or an animal for that matter is intermittent random

35
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,640
reward, a random intermittent reward that you don't know when you're going to hit the jackpot.

36
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,480
So you're scrolling, you're scrolling, and then you see something. Typically, it's very high,

37
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,040
what in nerd speak, we'd say signal to noise. So if you're reading some interesting things,

38
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,880
this came out in the news, this came out, and then it's all of a sudden a riot or a person that

39
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:25,280
is jumping, is based jumping off a building or for people that are scrolling, looking at bodies

40
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,520
or something like that, live bodies that hopefully people aren't looking at dead bodies. But look,

41
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:35,200
if something's very tragic, then that has this gravitational pull. And then what happens is you

42
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,320
start getting the system working for that next dopamine hit that you don't know when it's going

43
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:46,080
to come. It's just like gambling. So I look at social media as initially being very dopaminergic,

44
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,960
driving rewards, surprise and excitement, but very quickly transitioning to something more like OCD

45
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,040
and the kinds of behaviors where it looks, if we were to look at ourselves through the lens of an

46
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,640
experiment like we would an animal experiment, we think that animal is sick. If you saw an animal

47
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,640
digging in the corner, looking, looking, looking, looking for a bone, the dog is looking, looking,

48
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,760
looking, looking, looking, looking, looking, looking, you'd think that's really sad. That's us.

49
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:18,000
