WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.800
You say that you're useless to the world if you're not competing and you need enemies to drive you. Why?

00:08.520 --> 00:13.160
I think most people who say they don't have enemies

00:13.840 --> 00:17.480
They probably don't want to tell others they have the enemy or they don't want to disclose it

00:17.480 --> 00:20.960
They're great poker players. I don't know a single person that doesn't have an enemy

00:22.080 --> 00:23.680
Everybody does

00:23.680 --> 00:26.880
We're we're very good at concealing our

00:27.080 --> 00:33.680
Our insecurities our emotions our fears our wildest desires our

00:35.480 --> 00:39.480
Enemies or comments that rub us the wrong way that wire us

00:40.600 --> 00:42.600
We are very good actors

00:42.600 --> 00:47.240
Incredible actors right now if you have a long time of talking to somebody and you kind of watch them closely

00:47.240 --> 00:51.960
And the more they talk and then eventually you're gonna find some leaks. You're like, oh, I just found one right there

00:52.040 --> 00:57.880
Boom, I found one contradiction right there. Boom. I found one and they're okay interesting. We all have a little bit of that

00:58.720 --> 01:05.280
But I do think that when you study the people that do something very big. I'm not talking about small

01:05.280 --> 01:09.000
I'm talking really really big. We're talking about some interesting people today

01:09.160 --> 01:13.000
You and I have somebody we both respect a lot Robert Green his books

01:13.520 --> 01:18.640
I'm sure you love his books. I love his books 33 strategies of war. I couldn't put it down for two years straight. I

01:19.520 --> 01:21.520
listen to that book every day

01:21.960 --> 01:23.680
in my car

01:23.680 --> 01:27.880
Straight every day. It was on repeat for two years straight. Why though?

01:28.680 --> 01:31.240
because I innocently got into sales and

01:31.960 --> 01:35.200
I had a good time in sales and business after I got out of the military and

01:35.680 --> 01:38.480
I wanted to be a bodybuilder and then I realized I'm six four

01:38.480 --> 01:42.480
It's not gonna work for bodybuilding to win Mistro Olympia because everybody's five eight five nine five ten

01:42.480 --> 01:47.560
Maybe five a lemon Ronnie Coleman, but the six four days are behind us even Luc Ferigno didn't win at that height

01:47.880 --> 01:50.680
Arnold did and then when I got into sales and

01:51.560 --> 01:55.080
Everybody was a fan then I started competing still a little bit of fan

01:55.080 --> 01:59.080
But when I started the insurance company and then I started growing market share really

01:59.680 --> 02:02.120
Then a lot of those people that were fans then started

02:02.800 --> 02:08.920
Undermining and I said got it. This is how it works. You can't be this naive. You can't be this innocent

02:09.760 --> 02:12.880
Competitions out there if you want to kind of go out there and take market share from others

02:12.880 --> 02:14.080
You want to get bigger?

02:14.080 --> 02:18.320
You can't expect for people to sit there and like everything you're doing. That's what I realized

02:18.520 --> 02:23.680
You got to choose your enemies wisely people want you to do well. They just don't want you to do better than that. Yes

02:24.440 --> 02:25.640
Yes

02:25.640 --> 02:28.240
Yeah, it's interesting. There's this story of Churchill and

02:28.840 --> 02:33.720
He's showing a young MP around the House of Lords in the UK

02:33.720 --> 02:39.640
This is before World War two you can imagine that they're wandering through these dusty hallways over there's the

02:39.920 --> 02:42.760
Toilets and over there's where we have a cigar and blah blah blah

02:42.880 --> 02:45.640
Anyway, they go into the chamber they go into the House of Lords, right?

02:45.720 --> 02:52.800
The difference actually the distance between the two front benches is the same distance as a longsword held out at arm's length

02:52.800 --> 02:58.200
From both sides. She's a kind of a funny vestige of evidently what they were worried about in the Middle Ages

02:58.200 --> 03:01.840
And they've just continued to update but they've never changed the distance of the front benches

03:02.000 --> 03:07.200
Anyway, but this young guy who's probably full of testosterone and you know, he's finally he's here with Winston Churchill

03:07.840 --> 03:10.560
He go in and this young MP starts just

03:10.640 --> 03:14.360
Sticulating at the other side he keeps referring to them as the enemy

03:15.320 --> 03:20.000
Churchill turns to me says that's the opposition dear boy. The enemy's behind you

03:21.200 --> 03:25.920
And I love that story and the reason that I love that story is that it often reminds us that

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
symbolically we believe

03:29.760 --> 03:36.760
That the biggest obstacle we have to overcome is out there and many times the call is coming from inside of our own house

03:36.800 --> 03:40.720
I think that the worst enemy that many people have is the voice that's inside of their own head

03:40.720 --> 03:44.680
Now this voice has probably maybe come from the outside world, but we've now internalized it

03:44.680 --> 03:50.800
You know, we have become our own worst enemy in some regards. Yeah, and by the way, that's one of the enemies

03:50.800 --> 03:53.920
That's one of the enemies and there isn't one is the famous

03:55.160 --> 03:59.880
Matthew McConaughey speech that he's given. Hey one guy asked me who's the greatest actor in the world and he says hey

03:59.880 --> 04:03.640
You know, I'll tell you and then you're like I want to meet the 35 year old version of me

04:03.640 --> 04:06.000
And hey when I get to 35, you know, I want to make it 45

04:06.000 --> 04:10.440
It's always looking forward to what that next better version of you is going to be but

04:10.880 --> 04:17.000
At the end of the day, even Alexander one of his famous quotes is quotes is I have met the enemy it is I right and

04:17.880 --> 04:23.560
Although that is one element of an enemy. That's great. We need that

04:25.000 --> 04:28.800
Michael had it Brady had it Kobe had it, but

04:29.800 --> 04:32.680
There's a there's a crazy

04:33.800 --> 04:38.800
Psychologically you can call it, you know psycho competitor that

04:39.600 --> 04:44.200
They're constantly in the search of recruiting their next enemy

04:45.240 --> 04:51.840
It's it's like, you know, life is boring if I don't have my next target, you know

04:51.840 --> 04:57.720
I'm almost you know bad for myself if I don't have the next target the next enemy

04:57.760 --> 05:02.600
And if I choose it the right way, then I'm able to bring out a side of me. I've never seen before

05:02.920 --> 05:08.840
What's the function of an enemy? What is the function of an enemy? What is the function of?

05:10.320 --> 05:13.800
Fallen in love. Why do you need to fall in love? Why do you need to have a wife?

05:13.800 --> 05:17.420
It's pleasurable. It's fulfilling. But what does it do to you though when you're in love?

05:18.040 --> 05:23.280
You know, you know how they say when when a person is in love and they go and test their brains

05:23.280 --> 05:26.960
And it's like somebody that's on drugs. You've seen this before you probably read this before, right? Okay

05:27.560 --> 05:29.320
so

05:29.320 --> 05:31.320
But what's the risk of love?

05:32.320 --> 05:33.920
Heartbreak

05:33.920 --> 05:39.360
Losing years of maybe you love the wrong person. Maybe they don't love you in return as much as you love them

05:39.360 --> 05:42.840
Maybe you're gonna give more than they're gonna give you maybe a betrayal

05:43.480 --> 05:46.680
Maybe it's an act. Maybe it's just good for the season

05:46.680 --> 05:49.280
Maybe they're gonna change your minds if they really find out what you're out

05:49.280 --> 05:56.320
There's a lot of risk to love, but why do we love? You know, it's a very unique relationship that risk is exhilarating

05:56.360 --> 05:58.360
It's exciting, you know

05:59.160 --> 06:05.960
Maintaining it. It's a lot of work. It's not easy. It's why nowadays most people don't want to get married nowadays

06:05.960 --> 06:11.520
There's a movement of I don't want to get involved to getting married. I don't want to have kids. It's too risky

06:11.520 --> 06:14.040
I want to live for myself. I don't want to have the

06:14.880 --> 06:21.400
Responsibilities I don't want to be heartbroken. Okay, great. I think you know one time a friend of mine and I

06:21.640 --> 06:26.000
Arash we're in Italy and I rented this place in

06:26.640 --> 06:30.960
Tuscan, Italy, this is like 10 years ago and we're staying there and Arash and I when we're together

06:30.960 --> 06:35.720
We like to debate and we debate about anything. It doesn't matter what the topic is anything, okay?

06:35.920 --> 06:41.160
He's like the Middle Eastern Bradley Cooper too good looking of a guy one of those guys kind of like you're a good-looking guy

06:41.160 --> 06:42.800
He's a good-looking guy

06:42.800 --> 06:45.920
So we have a three-hour drive to Cinque Terre, okay?

06:45.920 --> 06:51.000
It's a beautiful place you go to and it's a long drive to go to it. You know what we're debating about love

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Here's what the question was

06:53.600 --> 06:59.560
Can you love somebody you know define love for me says love is a feeling it's emotion

06:59.560 --> 07:02.640
It's this it's a great. I said say you're in jail

07:03.200 --> 07:05.200
Your wife is somewhere else

07:05.600 --> 07:10.960
How does she know you love her? How do you show her love is love a verb is love a feeling is love a noun?

07:10.960 --> 07:12.960
What happened this conversation right and

07:14.400 --> 07:15.560
Then

07:15.560 --> 07:22.360
You realize the risk of loving is worth it. I can't imagine live in life without having that love

07:23.640 --> 07:28.360
It introduces you to a person you've not met before man a great enemy does that as well a

07:29.440 --> 07:36.920
Formidable enemy is gonna introduce you to a person you've not seen before by the way could be ugly could be scary could be oh

07:37.240 --> 07:41.160
My god, who is this person? Why are you acting like this? Why are you thinking like this?

07:41.480 --> 07:45.520
So most of us when we come almost like that the movie venom

07:45.520 --> 07:48.040
It's one of my son's favorite movie, right? The venom comes inside

07:48.120 --> 07:51.080
There's a there's an ugly side to it if you lose control of it, right?

07:51.080 --> 07:56.240
And you become reckless then you hurt people around you then you're actually not good for yourself. You're destroying your own life

07:56.240 --> 07:58.080
That's why the key word is what?

07:58.080 --> 07:59.920
Choose your enemies

07:59.920 --> 08:04.920
Wisely, it's not it's not have an enemy. It's choose your enemies wisely

08:05.080 --> 08:10.200
If I choose the right enemy and then I have this relationship with this enemy

08:10.880 --> 08:16.680
Sometime it's a one-month enemy. It could be a one-week enemy could be a one-day enemy could be a lifelong enemy because it's yourself

08:16.680 --> 08:18.680
because that's a permanent enemy and

08:19.240 --> 08:21.240
Just like a love affair

08:21.400 --> 08:25.640
There is an affair with this enemy. It's actually a beautiful thing. I

08:26.400 --> 08:30.440
Love the idea of it bringing out a side of you that you didn't know

08:30.680 --> 08:35.120
Bringing out a person inside of you that you want to wear existed. So I think there's a

08:36.800 --> 08:41.560
There's definitely a function to get that into you come on crack it in there's definitely a function to

08:43.040 --> 08:45.040
To people looking to be well balanced. Oh

08:47.400 --> 08:49.400
Yeah

08:50.280 --> 08:55.320
Delicious good wow fantastic. That's what I want to hear six months of taste testing

08:55.320 --> 08:58.200
So I'm glad that it takes time to fly to Liverpool to do that

08:59.200 --> 09:01.200
There is definitely a

09:01.440 --> 09:03.440
culture on the internet of

09:03.520 --> 09:05.520
people wanting to

09:05.600 --> 09:07.600
ameliorate all of their difficult and

09:08.040 --> 09:12.480
Uncomfortable emotions to transmute them into something closer to equanimity, right?

09:12.840 --> 09:18.360
balance peace sanity and I've said this a lot and I think that I'm quite averse to

09:19.200 --> 09:25.920
Conflict by nature. That's the way that I tend to operate. I often just bow out opt for peace

09:26.520 --> 09:27.680
and

09:27.680 --> 09:29.680
then

09:30.000 --> 09:31.680
Two things changed

09:31.680 --> 09:35.440
First off, I realized that I am leaving an awful lot of motivation on the table

09:35.440 --> 09:40.180
Okay by not utilizing a very specific very potent kind of fuel

09:40.800 --> 09:45.360
Because I was aware that over a long enough time span. I think it can be toxic

09:45.360 --> 09:50.600
I think that if you're fueled by hate and distaste and fear and scarcity for long enough

09:50.600 --> 09:54.200
It becomes something that damages you more than it helps you win

09:54.440 --> 09:58.160
But it's unbelievably potent especially in times of war

09:58.520 --> 10:06.640
The second thing that happened was I became a little bit more of a target for people's ire and distaste and that meant that the

10:08.080 --> 10:09.680
underdog

10:09.680 --> 10:14.040
Loving support that everybody has for the person that's on the come up

10:15.520 --> 10:19.920
Dissolved a little bit and started to evaporate because people don't mind you doing well

10:19.920 --> 10:23.840
They just don't want you to do better than them. You know when you're on the way up

10:23.960 --> 10:27.560
Everyone roots for you because you remind them of their dreams and when you're at the top

10:28.160 --> 10:31.120
Everyone tries to tear you down because you remind them of what they gave up on

10:31.880 --> 10:37.280
So those two things changed now had a great conversation with Alex Homozy that really drove this home to me

10:37.280 --> 10:40.640
Said use what you have and a lot of people have more pain than they do pleasure

10:41.360 --> 10:48.280
Don't use it for too long 10 15 20 years like that's how you end up having a breakdown or some sort of dependency or addiction or vice

10:49.280 --> 10:51.680
But it's potent so use it and I think that

10:52.200 --> 10:57.720
The inside of enemies can bring out a side of you that you are not aware you want to where even existed is

10:58.640 --> 11:00.400
Kind of like alchemy

11:00.400 --> 11:05.200
Right. It's turning something that is both toxic and useless into something which is golden and your choice

11:06.160 --> 11:09.560
Yes, and by the way your eyes. Okay. I'm looking at your eyes right now

11:10.400 --> 11:15.000
Your eyes don't tell me a guy that is just doing this

11:15.440 --> 11:17.960
To just have fun. Okay

11:18.320 --> 11:21.480
Your eyes have a lot of fire in them. Okay, a lot of fire in them

11:22.400 --> 11:28.240
You your eyes tell a story of maybe you have a crazy side a side inside of you

11:28.240 --> 11:33.480
Okay, a side that maybe you keep inside. Okay, we're very few people maybe see

11:33.760 --> 11:39.000
But that's why you're doing as well as you're doing. I walk into this place. I do a lot of podcasts

11:39.000 --> 11:44.160
I walk into this place you chose a walk in. I'm like Sam. Where are we? He says honestly, I don't know

11:44.160 --> 11:45.680
But I think we're at the right place

11:45.680 --> 11:50.960
We walk in and I see why you do what you do and the amount of time and resources and your team putting into

11:51.480 --> 11:58.520
Hands selecting a different set. We don't do that. So what does that tell me? You're maniacal your detail oriented

11:58.840 --> 12:03.200
You got it. You're moving up right now on the podcast across the board competing with everybody

12:03.440 --> 12:07.400
You have a vision. Maybe some of it. We know probably all of it. We don't know

12:07.400 --> 12:12.040
Okay, some of it's kept even the smiles telling the story right now. You're a perfect example of this, right?

12:13.000 --> 12:18.940
If you and I sit down we get the benefit I don't know if you read Elon Musk's recent book or not Walter

12:18.940 --> 12:19.760
I think so not yet

12:19.760 --> 12:23.680
No, I've heard from every single person that's even glanced at the blurb that you need to read it

12:23.680 --> 12:28.320
You need to read it. You're gonna flip out. You're gonna love it. You'll appreciate it for a guy. That's wired like you

12:29.440 --> 12:34.320
We get to judge Elon from the outside. Okay, why would somebody?

12:35.480 --> 12:39.520
You sell a company for 180 million dollars. You take a hundred million dollars. You put it in a

12:40.520 --> 12:46.840
Solar, whatever you take 70 and Tesla you put 10 in, you know, another company vice versa, whatever the structure

12:46.840 --> 12:52.640
No, you put 100 million in SpaceX 70 million in in Tesla and 10 million you put it in solar

12:53.360 --> 12:55.120
Then you're a billionaire

12:55.120 --> 12:59.920
Then you want to do what you want to go to the next thing then boring company then you got Twitter

13:00.240 --> 13:06.760
What for and you read a story in the book about his father on how his father was are you kidding me?

13:06.800 --> 13:13.720
Oh, I mean if you some of the biggest people that we read about we watch movies about it's one of their two parents

13:14.400 --> 13:17.600
That did something to them. I'm Tom Brady a

13:18.360 --> 13:20.360
month ago we haven't met the event and

13:21.000 --> 13:28.200
The the formula I see with a lot of people that do something biggest three things one at one point in their lives

13:28.200 --> 13:34.440
They experience unconditional love because you need it. It's fuel. You have to have it even if it's just from one person

13:34.440 --> 13:42.160
Okay, unconditional love means what you screwed up you went to jail. You got a DUI you got kicked out of school

13:42.160 --> 13:43.760
You got expelled

13:43.760 --> 13:50.200
Everybody ousted you and said you're a nobody you're not gonna mount to anything you're a loser. You're this but that mother

13:50.200 --> 13:52.200
They're always said honey. I love you

13:53.200 --> 13:56.480
You can do anything to lose this one person's love

13:57.120 --> 14:01.400
One person. It's all you need. You don't need 50 of them. Just one unconditional love number two is

14:02.040 --> 14:04.040
you need somebody who

14:05.200 --> 14:07.200
brought

14:07.200 --> 14:10.440
Unbelievable pain in your life that you loved

14:11.160 --> 14:15.480
This is a person you and I loved that they destroyed our heart

14:16.200 --> 14:20.640
We couldn't do anything to gain love from this person nothing

14:21.480 --> 14:27.320
Perform talent. We love them go above and beyond give them money buy him gifts

14:27.360 --> 14:33.480
Give them incredible experiences become buff have a six-pack drive a Ferrari have a Lambo own a penthouse

14:33.720 --> 14:38.480
Have a yacht be best friends with the best athletes with billionaires no matter what you do

14:38.920 --> 14:42.160
This person brought you so much pain. You can never win this person over

14:42.560 --> 14:46.880
It is a battle your entire life try to win this person over you're never going to do it

14:46.880 --> 14:49.440
It's not going to happen. Well, you need that person as well

14:49.600 --> 14:56.240
You know what the last one is obviously choosing your enemies wisely you take a person that has those three combination by the way

14:57.120 --> 14:58.760
very rarely

14:58.760 --> 15:02.840
Will they ever tell you the entire reason very rarely will they?

15:03.800 --> 15:07.840
Fully disclose everything some of them will take it to their grave with them

15:07.840 --> 15:12.720
We will never know about it, but for someone to have the kind of a fire that goes

15:13.240 --> 15:18.000
Yours beyond 99% of people would have stopped. What's the reason for it?

15:18.320 --> 15:22.480
What else do you need? How many more accolades? How many more tens of millions of dollars?

15:22.480 --> 15:28.280
How many more cars? How many more houses? How many more top charts on podcasts number one this? What's the reason for it?

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
You know, it's a

15:31.240 --> 15:37.000
Again, we're not talking about everybody most people will listen to this whole concept of choose your enemies wisely and they'll say

15:37.360 --> 15:40.680
That's hate. What a miserable life. What are this? What are that?

15:41.000 --> 15:49.120
No, most people chose the wrong enemies the enemies they've chosen is about being entitled is about being victims about feeling sorry for themselves

15:49.120 --> 15:56.560
And it's destroyed them the stolen stolen years away from their lives. So yeah, the way you're describing what you're saying

15:56.840 --> 16:02.040
You know, you'll typically see a pattern with those three things of people

16:02.760 --> 16:09.440
Who do something big they experience those three and unfortunately the reason why I like Musk's book is when you read it

16:09.440 --> 16:14.120
You see the pattern with all three unconditional love mom and Kimball his brother

16:14.920 --> 16:16.920
unconditional pain father

16:17.120 --> 16:19.120
choosing his enemies wisely

16:19.360 --> 16:20.880
industry

16:20.880 --> 16:27.240
Conditional, you know guys who are like this is the way we do with NASA, you know governmental agencies

16:28.120 --> 16:32.780
Censorship, you know establishment. He's just recruiting new enemies for himself every day

16:32.780 --> 16:37.880
It's like bored. He needs more enemies and more enemies, but guess who's talking about him around the world

16:38.760 --> 16:40.760
Everybody is in a hundred years from now

16:41.280 --> 16:45.760
Our kids our grandkids will look back and say and who was this Elon Musk guy

16:46.640 --> 16:50.280
Unfortunately, we're not gonna be around to talk about who it was how we viewed him

16:50.440 --> 16:54.840
But they're gonna be watching plenty of documentaries and movies about a guy like that because he chose his enemies wisely

16:55.200 --> 17:01.200
Feels to me. I've got in my mind the image of Pac-Man, you know, when he is able to eat the ghost

17:01.200 --> 17:03.080
Yeah, and the ghosts

17:03.080 --> 17:06.400
since were previously a threat to him now become fuel and

17:07.200 --> 17:09.200
that to me is I

17:09.840 --> 17:15.440
learned the three most common traits of elite performers and it was

17:16.480 --> 17:21.520
Acrippling sense of insufficiency a superiority complex and maniacal focus

17:21.520 --> 17:25.800
Yeah, and I think that those three things map on to what you were just talking about there

17:25.800 --> 17:32.000
Have you read this book? I've read the first half just so you know that part from your podcast is in the book. You're in the book

17:33.040 --> 17:39.080
Did you know this or no? No, you're in your podcast is in the book. Those three things you just talked about. Okay. It's in the book

17:39.080 --> 17:44.160
Hell, yeah. Yeah, so those three things, right? I'm scared that I'm not enough

17:44.800 --> 17:49.480
I believe that I can do more. Yep. I have the impulse control to be able to keep me focused and keep me moving forward

17:50.920 --> 17:52.920
What would you say to the people that say

17:53.200 --> 17:59.280
What you're describing sounds an awful lot like a competitor. Okay. Yeah, what's the difference between a competitor and an enemy?

17:59.280 --> 18:01.280
Yeah, it's not a competitor because to me

18:01.880 --> 18:04.240
So so in the last 20 some years

18:04.240 --> 18:10.840
I have worked my tail off to figure out a way of writing a business plan that I can teach others how to write a business plan

18:10.840 --> 18:12.840
So when you go buy books on business plans

18:13.240 --> 18:15.240
It's all boring

18:15.240 --> 18:20.440
Technical it's for a fortune 500 company or somebody that wants to go raise capital and it's so

18:21.120 --> 18:24.440
Complex and dense you will not think about a business planning book

18:24.960 --> 18:28.160
That you're gonna walk away and here's how I can write a business plan

18:28.160 --> 18:31.520
That's simple that I can look at it over and over and over again. Great. I'm good to go, right?

18:31.760 --> 18:38.120
There isn't something like that out there. This is supposed to be a business planning book that turned into an

18:38.840 --> 18:41.720
enemy's book so when I'm talking to the

18:42.160 --> 18:45.040
CEO the the publisher of a portfolio, okay

18:47.040 --> 18:52.360
Adrienne and we're going back and forth we had five hour zooms five one hour zooms

18:52.680 --> 18:57.640
Just on the title and in many cases we would sit there for 15 minutes. No one's talking

18:58.200 --> 19:00.960
We wanted what who won what he wanted what?

19:01.720 --> 19:06.920
So they wanted to figure out a title that was a straight-up title like you know

19:06.920 --> 19:10.880
Well, how to think and grow rich, you know, how to just stay very much of a business

19:12.320 --> 19:17.320
Exactly something like that and then eventually I'm selling Adrienne. I'm simple. That's not what it is

19:17.320 --> 19:23.840
This is much deeper than that. It has to do with enemies and eventually on the fifth time of choosing the title

19:23.960 --> 19:29.040
Guess who finally says the title the book has to be choose your enemies wisely Adrienne does from portfolio

19:29.040 --> 19:31.040
And I said that's the one it was a battle of attrition

19:31.040 --> 19:34.360
It was a battle of attrition a few hundred of them, right?

19:34.640 --> 19:37.800
But but it's an interesting concept when you're saying

19:38.480 --> 19:43.160
Competition to me the 12 building blocks that I talked about in this book, you know

19:43.160 --> 19:48.640
We have different categories because one side of the building block has to do with emotion

19:48.720 --> 19:53.400
The other side of the building block has to do with logic and you read this when you were going through the book

19:53.400 --> 19:59.640
So on the emotion side, you know, it's gonna move us. So for example, I mean, what skill says do I need to learn?

19:59.640 --> 20:01.960
Well, I need to learn how to do podcasts how to ask questions

20:02.160 --> 20:08.400
How to do research you told a Churchill story at the beginning with the sword the size and hey, your enemies are not ahead of you

20:08.400 --> 20:13.280
They're behind you. Okay, you have to go find that story. That's content, right? Okay, so that means you're constantly reading

20:13.320 --> 20:17.920
Why is this guy so good at what he does with content? Okay? He's very detailed. Look at the lighting

20:17.920 --> 20:20.920
Look how he doesn't look at his sets. He's intentional. He's not winging it

20:21.320 --> 20:26.600
Everything you're doing for the most part 95% of it can be replicated by somebody else

20:26.600 --> 20:31.800
But the 5% is your wit is your interest is the curiosity. I did a person has it or they don't have it, right?

20:31.800 --> 20:39.760
Okay, so yes, I can pick up those skills, but do I have your willpower? That's emotional. Yes, I can go study the competition

20:39.760 --> 20:44.720
Let me see the top podcast is out there what they're doing. What is the category for politics for business for sports for comedy?

20:45.160 --> 20:48.680
Yes, but enemies bigger study competition all you want

20:48.920 --> 20:53.160
But enemies a complete different criteria that you're talking about you can have all the money in the world

20:53.720 --> 20:57.800
Fantastic, that's finances. That's money. You can go raise money. There's plenty of companies that raise money

20:58.040 --> 21:02.200
Quibi a few years ago raised two point thirty billion dollars from who all the big money guys

21:02.600 --> 21:07.960
Everybody gave Quibi money. What happened to them Katzenberg make Whitman. Everybody behind it went out of business in

21:09.200 --> 21:11.200
1962

21:11.360 --> 21:13.360
1962 was a super-saving center

21:13.800 --> 21:18.520
Which is the year where Target came out Walmart came out and Costco came out all the same year

21:19.280 --> 21:21.280
1962 okay in

21:21.360 --> 21:23.360
1962 when these companies came out

21:24.360 --> 21:30.960
Kmart goes and raises a ton of money five years later Kmart has 250 locations

21:31.720 --> 21:35.200
Walmart has nine locations five years later

21:36.080 --> 21:43.320
Kmart on a leader's bulletin within five years guess who's winning Kmart's dominating all logical all numbers

21:43.880 --> 21:47.520
Spreadsheet etc. Etc. You couldn't tell me the founder of Kmart

21:47.840 --> 21:51.600
Who he is if I ask who's the founder came you're not gonna say mr. Kmart, right?

21:51.600 --> 21:57.440
That doesn't make any sense. What happened to Kmart a few years ago Kmart goes out of business. They're no longer round

21:57.600 --> 22:02.040
You know how many employees Walmart has around the world 2.3 2.5 million employees

22:02.240 --> 22:06.480
Do you know Walton Sam Walton when the best books you can ever read is made in America?

22:06.480 --> 22:08.960
It's 200 pages. He walks to you through how he built

22:10.080 --> 22:11.200
Walmart

22:11.200 --> 22:15.720
Do you know what his poorest kid is worth today poorest kid is worth 50 billion dollars today?

22:15.720 --> 22:19.120
He's got four of them. Can you imagine these guys at Thanksgiving? They're like hey Johnny

22:19.120 --> 22:22.320
I noticed man. You're only at 50 billion. Do I need to you know go for me?

22:22.320 --> 22:25.840
You know raise some money for you now. It's gonna be all right. You're gonna make it through

22:26.080 --> 22:28.880
What's the moral of the story the moral the story is

22:29.440 --> 22:35.760
One is logic the other one is emotion emotion brings out a different set if it can be controlled madness

22:36.160 --> 22:37.920
Controlled emotion

22:37.920 --> 22:43.520
It's gonna go into a different gear that a normal person's not gonna have we'll get back to talking to Patrick in one minute

22:43.520 --> 22:45.520
But first I need to tell you about element

22:46.400 --> 22:53.280
Elements contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio of sodium potassium and magnesium with no junk no coloring

22:53.280 --> 22:55.760
No artificial ingredients or any other BS

22:55.840 --> 23:02.480
It is a healthy alternative to sugary electrolyte drinks and it's how I've started my morning every single day for over three years now

23:02.560 --> 23:04.400
You don't need coffee first thing in the morning

23:04.400 --> 23:08.800
You're a denicine system that caffeine acts on isn't even active for the first 90 minutes of the day

23:08.880 --> 23:13.040
But your adrenal system is and salt acts on your adrenal system best of all

23:13.040 --> 23:17.760

23:29.520 --> 23:31.520
Or heading to drink

23:31.520 --> 23:33.520
lmnt.com

23:33.520 --> 23:35.520
Modern wisdom that's drink

23:35.520 --> 23:37.520
lmnt.com

23:37.520 --> 23:39.520
slash modern wisdom

23:39.520 --> 23:42.000
Let's start competition. You're saying competitors, right? Okay. No problem

23:42.080 --> 23:44.080
um

23:44.320 --> 23:45.920
In high school

23:45.920 --> 23:50.880
You can see somebody who was the best basketball player super competitive at that level say they're tall

23:51.120 --> 23:55.600
They're six six. They can jump 40 inches. They have a quick first, you know step

23:56.160 --> 24:02.240
They're very athletic in every way. They're the best athlete in the county even in the state for that position. No problem

24:02.880 --> 24:04.240
They go to college

24:04.240 --> 24:05.520
They can compete

24:05.520 --> 24:10.240
But maybe they're coming off the bench average in 7.2 points a game three rebounds to assist no problem

24:10.720 --> 24:12.480
They may not make it to the NBA

24:12.480 --> 24:15.280
But let's just say he makes it to the NBA plays a year two years

24:15.280 --> 24:16.560
Then he goes to Puerto Rico

24:16.560 --> 24:21.840
Then he goes to spain then he plays in turkey then he plays in china 10 years later never comes back to the NBA

24:22.240 --> 24:25.200
He's out now. He's an assistant coach in Puerto Rico or somewhere else

24:26.080 --> 24:30.480
Then there's a guy that comes to the NBA. He competes. He's talented. He shows into work

24:30.880 --> 24:35.360
He's a very good worker stable guy doesn't do the drugs doesn't do the alcohol

24:35.600 --> 24:38.000
He hooks up with a lot of girls, but he doesn't get in the way

24:38.240 --> 24:41.440
He doesn't respect, you know, he respects his teammates wives. He doesn't do anything

24:41.680 --> 24:44.560
He plays for 15 years makes 200 million dollars good for him

24:45.600 --> 24:47.600
Then you have the cycle competitor

24:48.320 --> 24:49.120
who

24:49.120 --> 24:50.240
Counts

24:50.240 --> 24:55.360
The 55 kids ahead of him that were chosen as the best high school basketball player

24:55.840 --> 24:59.360
And he's ranked number 56 and one by one by one

25:00.000 --> 25:03.280
He targets every one of them until he takes him out his name is Kobe Bryant

25:03.600 --> 25:05.600
Then you have michael jordan in 1984

25:06.000 --> 25:12.800
Where the number one draft pick is a kimalajuan fair good a lot good selection for the rockets number two is sambui

25:13.280 --> 25:18.080
I think portland picks him up or seattle picks him up. Number three is michael jordan. You pick me number three

25:18.880 --> 25:20.880
Yes, what happens to michael?

25:21.680 --> 25:23.440
these guys

25:23.440 --> 25:27.760
michael was never the highest paid guy in the NBA the only time michael was the highest paid guy in the NBA was

25:27.760 --> 25:29.760
The last year made 33 30 million dollars

25:30.080 --> 25:32.800
Scotty pippin made more money in the NBA than michael jordan ever made

25:33.520 --> 25:37.600
michael jordan today's worth 30 billion dollars scottie pippin is not what's the difference

25:38.080 --> 25:42.400
It's a very different mindset scottie's a competitor, but he's not at michael's level by the way

25:44.160 --> 25:47.120
It's very easy to criticize a guy like you who wants to compete

25:48.080 --> 25:50.640
And maybe internally you don't want to compete you want to dominate

25:51.040 --> 25:55.760
Maybe internally you want to show everybody. No, I'm going to be number one. Let's just say with him because professionally want to do this

25:56.880 --> 25:58.880
totally cool

25:59.280 --> 26:03.840
But there's a lot of other competitors out there that have good podcasts and they're doing a good job

26:04.160 --> 26:08.640
It's just a different mindset when you have that enemy. By the way

26:10.400 --> 26:19.440
Very rarely will those guys ever truly again reveal their top driver and the top enemy why?

26:22.160 --> 26:26.880
Because it's it's it's an element of insecurity. Yeah, it's a signal level of status

26:26.880 --> 26:31.600
It is it's it's and it's also I don't want to give the other person credit power

26:32.160 --> 26:36.320
I don't want to give that other person more power than the person thinks they have you don't have power

26:36.400 --> 26:41.440
Or because somebody may be like, oh, I'm your enemy. I control you exactly

26:41.840 --> 26:46.000
Well, when it's a part of the come-up story. Yeah, it's romantic

26:46.560 --> 26:50.960
Right. It's it's uh, it's grassroots. It's what's keeping you

26:51.600 --> 26:57.680
Going look at look at how I was mistreated by my first high school coach. They didn't see the I'm going to prove it to them

26:58.320 --> 26:59.360
That's

26:59.360 --> 27:01.360
a beautiful origin story

27:01.600 --> 27:03.360
age 20

27:03.360 --> 27:04.880
age 45

27:04.880 --> 27:07.520
That just sounds like someone who can't get the chip off his shoulder. Yeah

27:08.480 --> 27:13.680
So yeah, I think it's it's interesting how the tools that got you here aren't the ones that will get you there

27:14.480 --> 27:19.680
And how the strategy this is again one of the reasons why continuing to rely on

27:20.240 --> 27:25.600
Resentment and bitterness and the chip on your shoulder and enemies for too long becomes a very toxic fuel

27:25.680 --> 27:28.480
And it's also importantly optics are very very important

27:29.120 --> 27:31.120
It's a signal of low status

27:32.000 --> 27:36.640
Okay, you brought I don't disagree when you brought up a story of Churchill, right? Okay

27:37.360 --> 27:41.760
The world is weeks away from all speaking german

27:43.040 --> 27:46.240
Okay, if we lose the war the guy wins no problem

27:47.200 --> 27:48.960
chamberlain

27:49.040 --> 27:51.760
Cannot hold it together and the story about

27:52.400 --> 27:55.920
How the only way Churchill said he was going to come back is for chamberlain to come and beg him

27:56.800 --> 27:58.080
The only way

27:58.080 --> 28:03.440
Does it sound like something Churchill would do by the way? Absolutely. Yeah, Churchill sat there and said, okay

28:03.600 --> 28:07.520
He has to come and ask me because chamberlain sent other people he said no no no no no

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Only one person

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Has to come look at me face to face

28:12.640 --> 28:18.160
And say you can do a job. I can't do come back and help us think about

28:18.800 --> 28:20.800
Think about that now

28:21.360 --> 28:25.840
Visualize that scene we can see it in a movie or we can read in a book and by the way

28:26.480 --> 28:29.920
Say 50% of it is true. The other 50% is true, right?

28:29.920 --> 28:33.520
The other 50% is a lie and it's like build up mythical over generations, right?

28:34.160 --> 28:36.960
I believe that Churchill would want to hear it from

28:38.000 --> 28:45.920
A chamberlain. Have you heard of Churchill's ministry of ungentlemanly warfare? No, so this is a phenomenal book that everybody can go and read

28:46.160 --> 28:47.280
uh

28:47.280 --> 28:49.280
Before the second world war

28:49.760 --> 28:55.280
It was considered ungentlemanly to use guerrilla style tactics and in fact one of the

28:56.400 --> 29:01.120
British politicians said something to the effect of if this is what it takes to win the war

29:01.200 --> 29:03.360
I am prepared to lose they were

29:04.480 --> 29:06.480
The brits saw

29:06.480 --> 29:11.360
anything shy of gentlemanly conduct in war as a loss even if it resulted in a win

29:12.080 --> 29:15.680
And Churchill came in and changed that he was the one that changed that culture

29:16.000 --> 29:19.680
So he puts together this crack squad of eccentric weirdos

29:20.000 --> 29:22.320
One guy invents the limpid mine, right?

29:22.320 --> 29:27.200
Which you can descend to depths and then it'll attach using magnets and it'll blow things up another group

29:27.600 --> 29:34.400
Develop what is the uh predecessor to the sas another group are working on disguises and and guerrilla tactics to disrupt

29:34.960 --> 29:40.240
Infrastructure as the german advance is trying to move forward. Uh, so yeah, Churchill was prepared to play dirty

29:40.480 --> 29:44.320
But you know, you look at the tactics that were used

29:44.480 --> 29:50.480
They only came about because of one man who legitimated it and and he said we will do whatever it takes to win

29:50.800 --> 29:52.960
Now, here's the thing when you hear a story like that

29:53.760 --> 29:58.480
Um, somebody may say well, you know, what a what a what a cold-blooded bastard?

29:59.200 --> 30:01.280
Oh my god, no wonder people hate him

30:02.320 --> 30:04.320
No wonder he is who he is

30:04.480 --> 30:08.720
Where many president moved the bust of Churchill in the white house of wins that take this out

30:09.120 --> 30:14.080
So I don't represent what he represents. Everybody acts all hard, right?

30:15.200 --> 30:17.200
We can hate a Churchill during peacetime

30:17.760 --> 30:19.520
but during wartime

30:19.520 --> 30:22.320
You you beg for a Churchill to rise up

30:23.200 --> 30:26.320
wartime leaders like Churchill you only appreciate during

30:27.040 --> 30:27.840
wartime

30:27.840 --> 30:31.920
There's a really interesting insight from evolutionary psychology here. There's two types of leadership

30:32.000 --> 30:37.360
One is from dominance and the other is from prestige, right? One is uh more authoritarian

30:37.440 --> 30:43.360
It's tyrannical. It's very aggressive. The other is uh more altruistic. It's uh the

30:45.280 --> 30:48.080
The rise to power is denoted

30:48.880 --> 30:54.960
It's spread through the group everybody chooses together that this is someone who we all believe has the skills and

30:55.680 --> 31:01.200
The dominance is not the same and there are specific times when you want dominance and when you want prestige

31:01.520 --> 31:03.520
And in times of conflict you want

31:03.520 --> 31:08.240
Dominance sure sure you could say it in business. It's startup versus when it's more established, right?

31:08.560 --> 31:12.320
But here's also the thing like the part where you got to give a lot of credit to steve jobs

31:12.960 --> 31:15.360
steve jobs had a startup mentality

31:16.000 --> 31:19.600
and then he took that to the company and then he hires

31:20.640 --> 31:24.960
You know his uh scully that comes in from pepsi and he says you want to sell sugar

31:25.040 --> 31:27.600
Can you know water for the rest of your life or you want to change the world?

31:27.920 --> 31:31.200
He brings him in then he ends up being the reason to fire jobs

31:31.680 --> 31:33.680
Jobs leaves goes builds Pixar

31:34.320 --> 31:38.960
Sells it to disney most of his wealth is tied to disney not at apple then he comes back

31:39.680 --> 31:45.440
And he realizes that style of leading is not going to work to take the company to the next level when he comes back to apple

31:45.920 --> 31:50.480
The first phone call he says he says the idea of thinking microsoft is the enemy is behind us

31:50.480 --> 31:51.680
We can't think like that anymore

31:51.680 --> 31:57.200
This is what steve job says and he goes to microsoft and he gets 300 million dollars from microsoft

31:57.680 --> 32:03.840
To invest into apple and these guys hated each other microsoft came out in 76 apple came out in 77 a year apart

32:04.160 --> 32:07.600
And everybody was always comparing the two together bill gates ended up being much richer than

32:08.080 --> 32:11.760
steve jobs, but steve jobs was admired way more than

32:12.400 --> 32:14.400
Bill gates. So what does this mean?

32:15.040 --> 32:17.040
The individual has to

32:17.040 --> 32:19.040
Evolve like you have to also

32:19.280 --> 32:24.320
Recreate yourself as you're going through this the same enemy that drives you when you're 22 years old

32:24.560 --> 32:27.920
Should not be driving you at 32 years old or else you haven't matured

32:28.240 --> 32:30.720
You should also out matured that enemy

32:31.280 --> 32:37.200
And then 32 something else should be driving you then 42 then 58 and 63 then 75

32:37.760 --> 32:40.800
But you are going to have those love affair with those enemies

32:41.440 --> 32:42.480
That's a love affair

32:42.480 --> 32:47.920
You had an affair with this enemy over an eight year span over a 13 year span over a six year span over a six month span

32:48.480 --> 32:53.600
But you know, there is truth in the idea of you still being driven by that enemy

32:53.920 --> 32:56.720
18 years after you beat that enemy 13 years after you beat that enemy

32:57.280 --> 33:03.760
Someone who I think is particularly good at creating enemies from modern pop culture and our industry is bench of hero

33:04.000 --> 33:09.040
Okay, what do you think about what he's doing at daily wire from an enemy perspective and and generally

33:09.280 --> 33:13.200
You talked about recently with his feud with Tucker Carlson or period everything overall

33:13.840 --> 33:14.880
um

33:14.880 --> 33:18.720
I think Tucker's a true believer. I think Tucker is not somebody that

33:19.520 --> 33:22.320
If he's doing it intentionally to get under your skin

33:23.040 --> 33:28.720
Let's say that's 20 percent. Let's say it's 10 percent because he's witty and he's smart and he's sharp

33:29.440 --> 33:32.800
Tucker or ben i'm sorry ben ben Shapiro. So you're talking about right? Yeah

33:33.040 --> 33:36.880
Let's say ben is doing that 10 or 20 percent intentionally to get under your skin. Okay

33:37.600 --> 33:42.720
But this guy at a young age wanted to be supreme court. Just you know, he's been wanting to be that for a long time

33:43.040 --> 33:47.920
This is not a regular guy. I think at 12 or 13 years old. He performed in front of a couple thousand people

33:48.560 --> 33:54.560
His level of intelligence of how early on he got a degree went to college 15 16 years old that all the stuff that he did

33:55.040 --> 33:56.000
so

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
He's 100 true believer

33:58.560 --> 34:00.560
Does he have an element that he can

34:00.720 --> 34:04.720
Talk to somebody and say I can murder you in a debate right now if you really want to go there. Yes

34:04.720 --> 34:10.000
He has that element as well. Yeah, does he have a side of him that's a maybe a bully type a little bit? Sure

34:10.400 --> 34:14.560
Well, don't forget during school. He was very heavily bullied himself very heavily bullied

34:14.640 --> 34:18.720
But that's what happens typically to people like him, but that may be

34:19.680 --> 34:21.680
the number one driver

34:22.000 --> 34:27.520
That he's continuing because he wants for the rest of his life for those bullies to talk about that ben Shapiro used to be a

34:27.600 --> 34:28.720
Classmate

34:28.720 --> 34:33.520
What makes him go out to pace that he goes you think it's just all these other guys that we see there's no way

34:33.680 --> 34:37.120
You think he would ever tell us you think his own family knows that highly doubted

34:37.200 --> 34:39.360
It's to himself many of these people that he has in his life

34:39.760 --> 34:44.000
Anybody that goes at that pace like tucker Carlson today. I don't know if you saw the approval

34:44.000 --> 34:49.440
He got I think they got 150 million dollars today from some organization who did took his organization

34:49.520 --> 34:53.120
Yeah, so finally today the ward is out that he raised money. It's it's a hundred

34:53.200 --> 34:55.440
It's a big amount of money that he finally raised today

34:55.920 --> 35:01.200
Who's his enemy? He's got a very easy enemy. He's got fox news former employer as an enemy

35:01.520 --> 35:04.640
He's got a lot of political people as an enemy people with silo some as an enemy

35:04.800 --> 35:09.360
You know how many enemies tucker got you think tucker needs another 300 million dollars that he has in a bank account

35:09.360 --> 35:10.800
I highly doubt so

35:10.800 --> 35:17.520
He's doing it for a complete different reason because he wants to give the middle finger to five 10 15 different people in his life

35:17.680 --> 35:20.000
You just sense it with tucker and by the way, you know, it's wild right now

35:20.480 --> 35:27.520
Ben Shapiro went after tucker this week. What happened because of uh, uh, israel tucker's position where he says we should focus on

35:28.160 --> 35:29.600
a hundred thousand

35:29.600 --> 35:35.200
Uh, uh, people in america that are dying from fentanyl not focused on what's going on in israel and gaza and ben Shapiro says

35:35.680 --> 35:39.760
You know, we can chew gum and walk at the same time specifically from the moral standpoint

35:39.760 --> 35:45.840
We can handle two different moral issues, but you know, they're going back and forth whether it's a seasonal thing or not

35:45.840 --> 35:49.280
That's a complete different, you know competition that we're talking about. I suppose

35:50.480 --> 35:54.320
Uh, how would you say enemies of convenience are sometimes good for optics?

35:54.640 --> 36:00.320
You know, what have we just seen dylan danis logan paul ksi tommy fury jake paul tommy fury

36:01.120 --> 36:02.880
logan paul

36:02.880 --> 36:04.880
jake paul and

36:06.400 --> 36:08.400
Who's the jiu-jitsu guy stocked in slaps

36:09.280 --> 36:11.680
Diaz, thank you. Nate Diaz love that guy

36:12.400 --> 36:18.880
Enemies of convenience. Yeah, you know like nothing gets people's tongues wagging more than you creating a little bit of a feud

36:19.440 --> 36:21.040
on the internet

36:21.040 --> 36:22.560
dc, uh

36:22.560 --> 36:26.080
They announced yesterday speaking of feuds and speaking of disney

36:26.560 --> 36:32.240
That the daily wire are going to do that own version of snow white with brett cooper starring in snow white. I saw that

36:32.960 --> 36:36.960
I saw that I mean that to me is you know, largely a

36:37.920 --> 36:40.800
declarative statement of culture war on what's happening with

36:41.520 --> 36:46.800
Children with children's movies, you know, it's synthesizing down all of the little tangential issues that have been included

36:47.120 --> 36:50.640
Is there anything to do with the push toward the sort of books that are in school? Is it us?

36:51.040 --> 36:57.840
You know denying this uh rachel's ziggler ziggler throwing snow white under the bus like she doesn't have a prince charming

36:57.840 --> 37:00.560
She has a stalker. We don't need that. What do you think about that?

37:01.840 --> 37:06.000
I think that it is a very dangerous lesson to teach young girls that

37:07.040 --> 37:10.320
Boys that show interest in them are dangerous and to be avoided

37:10.480 --> 37:13.280
I think it makes for a generation of fragile

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
narcissistic fearful young girls

37:16.240 --> 37:20.720
That I wouldn't want as a daughter and that I don't want as a mother. You know what a perfect example that is

37:22.080 --> 37:27.200
The movement of feminism is the ultimate example of not choosing your enemies wisely

37:28.560 --> 37:31.360
You chose men as being the enemy

37:32.480 --> 37:35.920
40 years later 50 years later you're 65 years old

37:36.560 --> 37:38.560
Single not married no kids

37:39.440 --> 37:41.920
You're living in an apartment or a condo with a dog

37:42.640 --> 37:48.160
Or a cat that that's all you ever talk about and you're lonely and you're sitting there saying

37:48.800 --> 37:50.080
I was wrong

37:50.080 --> 37:52.080
Men are not the enemy, but guess what?

37:52.640 --> 37:57.040
That movement stole 50 years of your life. You know how painful that is

37:58.240 --> 38:01.680
What what she's doing right now with the messaging she's given and then getting out there and saying well

38:01.680 --> 38:03.440
I don't want to be able to have to do this. No, you know

38:04.160 --> 38:07.040
That's not necessarily going to be that way nowadays, you know, women don't need that anymore

38:07.040 --> 38:11.440
It's a completely different era right now. We're talking about and to do this at a hundred your anniversary of disney

38:11.680 --> 38:12.640
Yeah

38:12.640 --> 38:13.600
Really

38:13.600 --> 38:19.200
With what waltz and many of us I remember living in iran watching disney cartoons translated in farce

38:19.920 --> 38:21.920
Literally in farce

38:22.000 --> 38:27.360
It's it's very weird when you watch it in farce because the language is a rough language, you know, you watch pinocchio

38:27.920 --> 38:32.080
In farce it's not as appealing right, but we grew up with this stuff

38:32.160 --> 38:35.200
You know, we grew up with watching these cartoons to see that taking place

38:36.240 --> 38:42.240
Is uh, if you ask me, it's absolutely pathetic, but you're seeing how many back-to-back-to-back flops disney has right now

38:42.400 --> 38:47.600
Yeah, and it's not a good look. Um, by the way, the buyers who want to buy disney. They're loving this

38:48.480 --> 38:52.400
Apple's one of the most qualified buyers. They they hope disney makes five more flops

38:52.880 --> 38:56.720
apples sitting there saying make five more flops. Iger, please by the way

38:57.680 --> 39:04.160
Have you read the ride of a lifetime by bob Iger? Okay another interesting guy what he did with a 38 career at abc

39:04.160 --> 39:07.040
Obviously he's been there a lot longer, but when you read the book the first 38 run

39:08.320 --> 39:10.320
To be one of the best power brokers

39:11.040 --> 39:13.440
Then to finish your career up the way you're doing right now

39:14.080 --> 39:15.440
very

39:15.440 --> 39:20.800
Very bad way of finishing it. He's not an idiot, right? You don't have the excuse of not knowing

39:20.880 --> 39:25.680
He is for what a point you just made he is 100 not an idiot

39:25.920 --> 39:30.320
This guy was about to run for president bob Iger was gonna he was one of the guys that everybody was trying to get to

39:30.320 --> 39:34.880
Run for president him and oprah. They were supposed to be this literally. This was the conversation

39:35.520 --> 39:39.600
so he also ended up choosing the wrong enemies and

39:40.240 --> 39:41.920
The wrong allies

39:41.920 --> 39:47.120
Not realizing your best allies are parents. You're losing parents who have been watching this for years

39:47.680 --> 39:51.520
You're losing the people that this is a legacy product

39:52.400 --> 39:56.800
It's another example of a complete screw-up that's going to come out of discount for somebody else like apple

39:57.040 --> 40:00.560
I mean look at to go back to ben and what jeremy are doing over the daily wire

40:02.720 --> 40:08.320
Hershey's do a campaign that they don't like within five days. They've released their own chocolate bar

40:09.760 --> 40:12.400
That shaving company does something they don't like within

40:13.040 --> 40:17.040
24 hours, maybe they filmed a video with a mclaren for jeremy's razors

40:17.760 --> 40:21.760
They don't like the way that's fantastic commercial by the way. Well done. Jeremy's got jeremy's got skills

40:22.000 --> 40:25.760
I listened to him and shepiro talking about the fact that originally jeremy was the talent

40:26.480 --> 40:30.880
And ben was the money man and the the the uh data guy behind the scenes

40:30.880 --> 40:35.600
Do you know zack levi? I think it's him exactly by the actor who played the uh, what is the movie?

40:36.320 --> 40:37.840
the the

40:37.840 --> 40:38.880
the

40:38.880 --> 40:43.760
Super hero for kid movies. What is the guy's name? Ben 10? What is it? Ben 10? No?

40:44.240 --> 40:49.360
It's a recent one. You're the one with like yeah four kids. Yeah, trust me. I've seen this movie a couple times

40:50.080 --> 40:54.560
He played kurt warner a recent movie that came out the american underdog. He played kurt warner

40:55.360 --> 40:56.480
him

40:56.480 --> 40:57.200
and

40:57.200 --> 41:00.400
Jeremy used to have a production company apparently 10 15 years ago

41:00.720 --> 41:04.160
And zack ended up being a big time actor in hollywood doing very good for himself

41:04.800 --> 41:09.200
And by the way, jeremy is another great example of a guy that's got enemies. Just look at his eyes

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
When you talk when you hear jeremy speak

41:12.240 --> 41:16.800
You see the fire built for enemies. He's got enemies and he wants to take those enemies out

41:16.800 --> 41:24.000
But that's why I thought the daily y was an illustrative example because they are as far as I can see largely a company built on

41:24.720 --> 41:30.080
Identifying enemies, you know, they're very much in opposition to ideas that they don't like to movements

41:30.080 --> 41:32.880
They don't like to people that they don't like and uh

41:33.920 --> 41:37.040
Yeah, man, I mean it's you have to be built for that

41:37.280 --> 41:43.280
You really really do need to be built for it. And it certainly seems to me that what ben and what jeremy are doing over there is

41:44.480 --> 41:46.240
Purpose built to be

41:46.240 --> 41:51.920
The anti this the anti that and a lot of the time it's new movements that they don't just they don't agree with

41:52.960 --> 41:55.760
The market's gonna prove if the concept is gonna work or not

41:55.840 --> 41:59.760
And if it can't sustain because if it's a built to solve concept, they're gonna be they're gonna succeed

42:00.320 --> 42:06.080
But can somebody else come and pick up that concept and continue with that with the same level of fire?

42:06.720 --> 42:11.520
It's gonna take a couple decades to figure that part out. It's interesting to think, you know from from our side

42:11.840 --> 42:16.880
When you see those rachel ziggler interviews and she's saying courting is stalking

42:17.360 --> 42:23.520
Um a girl doesn't need to be saved by a prince. You know, she's busy thinking about how she can fulfill her own dreams

42:23.520 --> 42:26.000
And becoming the woman that she always knew that she could run and so forth

42:26.480 --> 42:28.480
You think a lot of people are

42:29.120 --> 42:31.120
Is that really the you know the highest

42:32.000 --> 42:36.160
Manifestation is that real self-actualization for young women nowadays?

42:36.160 --> 42:40.400
That's the question they ask and you're totally right that look ultimately the market will choose

42:40.960 --> 42:45.440
There's no question about it. The market will choose the market is brutal. You know, you know, it's a great thing about

42:45.440 --> 42:51.600
It's always right. It's always right, you know, you can you can say well, let me tell you I'm the best bodybuilder in the world

42:51.920 --> 42:56.880
Yeah, okay. Look at your calves. Yeah, good luck. You go put those a little skimpy, you know

42:57.840 --> 42:59.440
Shorts on and see what your

42:59.440 --> 43:04.000
You know legs look like now. You're not as good as you think you are you're full of it. Yeah market is brutal

43:04.640 --> 43:08.240
podcast business concepts investments drinks

43:08.960 --> 43:12.480
You know alcohol books you write when we first wrote

43:13.120 --> 43:17.040
When I first wrote your next five moves and we launched at august of 2020

43:17.280 --> 43:18.960
This is during the peak of kovat

43:18.960 --> 43:22.320
My publisher simon and schuster asked and says so how do you think the book's gonna do?

43:22.640 --> 43:25.600
How you gonna judge the book me and greg dinkin are talking I said

43:26.080 --> 43:28.880
If the book is doing well three years from now, it was a good book

43:28.880 --> 43:32.320
You can have a great marketing campaign the book does well the first 30 60 90 days

43:32.880 --> 43:34.880
But is the book selling three years later if it is

43:35.600 --> 43:37.600
That's a great book because the market will tell you that

43:39.360 --> 43:41.360
Yeah, very interesting to think about how

43:42.480 --> 43:43.840
optics

43:43.840 --> 43:44.880
and

43:44.880 --> 43:47.440
There are ways to game the system and I think people are very

43:48.800 --> 43:50.400
They're hyper aware of this

43:50.480 --> 43:52.480
They understand that there are

43:52.960 --> 43:54.960
People who have managed to use

43:55.360 --> 44:02.640
Tactics and hacks to get themselves into a position that they maybe didn't quite deserve that the legitimacy of the product the book or whatever it is

44:02.960 --> 44:04.960
the person who

44:05.680 --> 44:09.600
Maybe uh when megan markles autobiography comes out perhaps people would

44:10.160 --> 44:14.960
Accuse her of doing something like this, right? It's not to do with the actual product. It's to do with the positioning

44:16.160 --> 44:18.160
And sometimes that does work

44:18.480 --> 44:20.320
but ultimately

44:21.120 --> 44:23.760
Form is temporary and class is permanent

44:24.560 --> 44:26.560
navals got this great quote where he says

44:26.720 --> 44:27.520
Um

44:27.520 --> 44:29.520
Karma is just people repeating their beliefs

44:30.080 --> 44:32.880
Actions and behaviors until they finally get what they deserve

44:33.360 --> 44:35.760
You just roll the dice you keep rolling the dice, right?

44:35.760 --> 44:38.800
Every single time every single thing you do the way that you interact with the uber driver

44:38.880 --> 44:43.440
The way that you pay or don't pay the bill or invoice that you've got every tiny little thing each time

44:43.840 --> 44:48.000
Is an opportunity for your true nature to come up and people just keep on rolling the dice

44:48.640 --> 44:53.360
Keep on rolling the dice and then every so often someone hits double one and you go. Oh, there we go

44:54.560 --> 45:00.000
But it's temporary you can't do permanently megan merkel whether her motives are really because she loves

45:00.720 --> 45:06.000
The prince and it's like harry. She's in love with them or she's using the power to bully and

45:06.640 --> 45:08.640
Get what she wants out of it

45:08.800 --> 45:13.920
The market is brutal. Look what happened to amber herd for how many years did everybody think?

45:14.000 --> 45:18.880
You know johnny depp was a bad guy for how many years? Oh johnny depp was an abusive

45:18.960 --> 45:22.240
You know relationship all this up and then they start showing the clips

45:22.960 --> 45:26.080
The videos and johnny's comfortable. Would it be in public?

45:26.720 --> 45:28.720
and all of a sudden

45:28.960 --> 45:30.480
180

45:30.480 --> 45:33.040
The world is like what an asshole

45:33.840 --> 45:35.120
She is

45:35.120 --> 45:39.120
Not him. I love johnny the next thing you know the love affair was like

45:39.600 --> 45:45.920
How many more men are going through like johnny is and then how many women said she ruined it for women who were actually abused

45:46.560 --> 45:53.440
So yeah for longest time. Oh my god crying is so such a so difficult time what he was so when he hit me

45:54.000 --> 45:55.440
We fell for it

45:55.440 --> 45:59.840
But we will only fall for it temporarily not permanently the market will reveal eventually

46:00.480 --> 46:06.080
Hopefully yeah, I again man form is temporary classes permanent and people will ultimately get what they deserve

46:06.240 --> 46:09.280
Uh when it comes to the courting is stalking

46:10.400 --> 46:12.400
Culture that we have at the moment

46:12.640 --> 46:14.640
You've got a daughter. You've got young sons

46:15.120 --> 46:18.400
You also spend some time undervalutainment talking about

46:19.040 --> 46:21.520
Intersexual dynamics and what's going on between the sexes

46:22.080 --> 46:28.160
What do you make of the current dating scene for men and women and why do you think it's being demonized in some ways?

46:28.560 --> 46:32.640
From what perspective from I think that there is an anti dating culture at the moment

46:33.040 --> 46:39.360
I think that men and women are being encouraged to be treated as equals. Uh, sorry as adversaries not as equals, right, right?

46:40.000 --> 46:44.480
Um, I think it's transactional today. I think it's easy today

46:45.120 --> 46:51.840
I think the swipe right community is it's friday night 11 o'clock. Let me swipe right. I'm gonna use 20

46:52.320 --> 46:56.800
Someone's gonna get back to me if they swipe right and they so and typically I would go after an eight and a half nine

46:56.800 --> 46:59.680
But it's friday night. I'm gonna go do a six and a half seven. No one's gonna know

47:00.000 --> 47:05.280
I'm gonna invite her back to my place. She knows if she's on tinder. I'm not on bumble. Whatever these dating apps are

47:06.080 --> 47:08.720
And so it's transactional strategic

47:08.720 --> 47:15.520
No one's gonna know and literally not a lot of people are gonna know you can really run through 20 40 50 100 nowadays and it's not a

47:16.480 --> 47:18.080
Big deal. Okay

47:18.080 --> 47:23.040
So what does that do? Whatever is too easy to come you devalue it. You don't value it that highly

47:23.680 --> 47:26.000
You know my era you had to court

47:26.480 --> 47:31.520
You had to prospect you had to have scripts. You had to build relationship. You had to follow up

47:31.520 --> 47:36.480
We didn't have these types of things to do. We had my space the last time I was single. There was my space

47:36.960 --> 47:38.960
Okay, I DM'd uh

47:39.280 --> 47:43.040
My wife on my space my wife and I knew each other for five and a half years

47:43.600 --> 47:48.640
Eventually we're in palm springs for the first time. She's single. I'm single ever for five and a half years

47:48.880 --> 47:50.880
We're both single

47:51.440 --> 47:52.480
And

47:52.480 --> 47:54.480
You know we go on a date first date

47:55.040 --> 47:57.440
PF Chang's December 29 of 2007

47:58.000 --> 48:01.760
Used just when PF Chang used to be good when they had their uh, their their noodle soup

48:01.760 --> 48:07.520
They don't have it anymore used to be they took that away phenomenal item on the menu. I'm convinced they they fell apart after that

48:08.160 --> 48:11.040
So anyways, we go to well PF Chang's by the way, if you're watching bring it back

48:11.120 --> 48:15.520
It was actually a very good item on the menu. So we go on a date. There's magic

48:16.000 --> 48:19.520
She's smiling. I'm smiling. You know the smile. That's kind of like I'm happy to see you

48:20.240 --> 48:22.960
And then it's midnight where the last people left at PF Chang's

48:23.600 --> 48:26.640
You know waiter comes up to me and he says what's going on

48:27.120 --> 48:32.160
I said, you know, my wife wants to follow divorce. She doesn't want to be with me anymore. So your wife why?

48:32.960 --> 48:37.840
Yeah, I come from a different religious background and her family's convinced we got to split up and he has no clue

48:37.840 --> 48:39.840
We're not married. We're just on our first date

48:39.840 --> 48:44.720
He sits down for 15 minutes convincing her to stay with me if you love him stay with him

48:44.720 --> 48:46.400
It was a beautiful, you know

48:46.400 --> 48:50.880
Seeing that we have we go in the car she goes home the next day I take her we go do stairs in Santa Monica

48:51.440 --> 48:54.320
We go to church. We go to earth cafe in Santa Monica

48:54.880 --> 48:55.840
Then we go to boarders

48:55.840 --> 49:01.520
I buy her book on our second date called 101 questions to ask before you get engaged on our second date by norman right

49:02.400 --> 49:07.200
She's like, what's this? I said, I'm not looking for a girlfriend. I'm looking for a wife. I'm 28 at the time

49:07.920 --> 49:12.160
Uh, I said, I know exactly what I want. I've already done this exercise with three other girls

49:12.320 --> 49:14.080
If you want to go through it great

49:14.080 --> 49:18.400
You need to answer the questions. Let's meet up when you're ready and let's go through it week later

49:18.720 --> 49:22.800
Six hours at her place one by one by one each question we go through

49:23.280 --> 49:26.880
I said, this is somebody I can date and by the way, it's ugly because you got to talk about everything in the book

49:28.000 --> 49:29.840
so today

49:29.840 --> 49:32.160
That's not it anymore today. It's too

49:33.200 --> 49:37.840
Risky today. It's you don't have access to that anymore today percentages are coming out where

49:38.480 --> 49:43.440
marriages from dating sites have the least chance of working out versus marriages where you meet somebody through a referral

49:43.440 --> 49:48.160
Where you say pat I've known mary for seven years. I think you and her should talk not know what's going to happen

49:48.160 --> 49:52.080
Let me set you guys up. Let's take our girls and do a double day. Cool. Hey, I kind of like her

49:52.080 --> 49:55.920
This is good. Well, you're telling me seven years. I've only seen her be with one guy larry five years

49:55.920 --> 49:58.800
He was an asshole then she's been with this other guy two years, but she's single now

49:59.280 --> 50:01.440
Now I have some kind of a history I'm dealing with right

50:02.880 --> 50:07.520
So it is a different climate now with kids. It's a different story on how you raise him

50:08.880 --> 50:10.480
my

50:10.480 --> 50:12.480
10-year-old son he's he's been

50:13.040 --> 50:17.440
He's had a girlfriend since he was five years old literally at a birthday party at five years

50:17.440 --> 50:21.280
So he's making out with this other girl at this they've embossed they've embusters. I'm like babe

50:21.280 --> 50:25.200
What is going on his mom is asking me, you know, our kids are kissing. I said, well, I got a son

50:25.200 --> 50:27.760
You got a daughter. You may want to stop your daughter, but I'm not gonna stop my son

50:28.480 --> 50:32.320
So she's like well guys guys. No stop stop. They don't even know what's going on

50:32.880 --> 50:36.000
So there's you need to have the conversation with kids early today

50:36.640 --> 50:41.520
Uh, I remember having conversation with my boys when they were six and five in the shower and I said, okay

50:41.520 --> 50:47.360
We need to have this conversation together. What's that? Okay, stand up. That's your dangling. That's his dangling

50:47.440 --> 50:49.120
This is my dangling

50:49.120 --> 50:52.800
Only you get to play with your dangling one day. You're gonna find a girl

50:53.360 --> 50:55.280
That's gonna play with your dangling till then

50:55.840 --> 50:59.280
God gave you that dangling for only you to play with your dangling now. You got to see how they're looking at me

50:59.280 --> 51:05.360
By the way, they're looking at me like this and my wife leaves quickly. She's like, babe. This is unconscious, babe. You can leave

51:06.000 --> 51:07.520
So we have that conversation

51:07.520 --> 51:10.960
I think you need to have the conversation today because most parents are on middle eastern

51:10.960 --> 51:12.960
They don't have those types of conversations

51:12.960 --> 51:15.760
No one's talking about sex and condoms and all this kind of stuff

51:16.240 --> 51:18.560
You need to start early but the dating scene today

51:19.680 --> 51:22.560
Very very different than what it was when I was single

51:23.040 --> 51:29.600
Uh, I if I wanted to go date today and find a wife my approach would be very different than what most people are doing today

51:31.040 --> 51:31.680
Very different

51:31.680 --> 51:33.440
We'll get back to talking to patrick in one minute

51:33.440 --> 51:35.280

52:39.920 --> 52:43.440
And you just suggested at that as well. What are the right things?

What should people be impressed by in what area in relationship? No in life in life

52:47.920 --> 52:54.960
What is it that people are miscellaniously being impressed by that they shouldn't be so your guy chase right wherever chase is

52:55.120 --> 53:00.720
Okay, right there and then uh, you're uh, where's uh, dean? Where's dina dina's in the back?

53:01.360 --> 53:06.080
Okay, you're telling me about dean and what dean does he's been with you two years three years?

53:06.160 --> 53:11.360
What you said 2,500 episodes and how many uh, uh 700 episodes two and a half thousand videos

53:11.440 --> 53:15.760
Two and a half thousand videos 700 episodes. Yeah, okay. What does that say about you a lot?

53:16.400 --> 53:22.400
Okay, if somebody works with you for six years, what are they gonna learn about you your temper your expectation?

53:22.720 --> 53:24.160
Hey boys, are we ready?

53:24.160 --> 53:30.240
This is all standard and expectation the expectation that you have that is a reflection of he likes working with you

53:30.240 --> 53:33.360
Why does he like working with you? I don't know but you do something right for him to want to work with you

53:33.360 --> 53:37.520
And then you told me what you're doing with them structure. That's private stuff that you told me

53:38.240 --> 53:40.240
So you watch people you watch

53:40.880 --> 53:47.680
Values principles you watch how they treat people you watch how people treat them you watch how people respond to them you watch

53:48.480 --> 53:54.720
How they are with powerful people you watch how they are with regular average day-to-day people you

53:56.800 --> 53:57.840
You look for that today

53:57.840 --> 54:04.720
It's not the cars the the lambos the ferrari's the houses all that stuff. By the way, i'm a capitalist and I love all that stuff

54:05.600 --> 54:06.480
but

54:06.480 --> 54:08.480
I like that stuff because

54:08.480 --> 54:11.200
Different reasons. I enjoy the game. I'm a kid

54:12.560 --> 54:17.360
I'm turning 45 tomorrow. I'm 44 today for the last day tomorrow. I'll be 45

54:17.920 --> 54:20.880
But there's an element of childlike stuff that brings out

54:21.360 --> 54:25.840
The 14 year old kid when I look at a baseball card. I'm a kid when I look at a baseball card

54:25.840 --> 54:29.200
The average person's like who cares about baseball cards. That's a different element, but

54:30.800 --> 54:35.840
The relationships the way they treat people values and principles what they value

54:36.400 --> 54:38.400
you look for those types of things and

54:39.200 --> 54:42.080
Eventually enough will be revealed the more you pay attention

54:42.640 --> 54:43.760
That's one of the byproducts

54:43.760 --> 54:49.440
I think that is dangerous sometimes of people who play the game that they get captured by the game and they forget that it is a game

54:49.760 --> 54:52.400
And they see the game as reality

54:52.720 --> 54:56.880
They don't realize that there is something which is supposed to be deeper which is hidden below the surface

54:57.200 --> 54:59.200
So I did rogan's show last year

54:59.280 --> 55:03.120
And I listened back to the episode he said something on it that I really wanted to dig into

55:03.600 --> 55:09.040
And he listened back I listened back and and pulled this this really really powerful insight for me

55:09.040 --> 55:11.040
It was one of the most powerful things I learned last year

55:11.600 --> 55:13.280
and he said

55:13.280 --> 55:16.960
Just because something is hard to obtain does not mean that it is valuable

55:18.560 --> 55:24.320
Just because something is hard to obtain doesn't mean it's valuable. Correct. Yeah, just because it's difficult to get

55:24.800 --> 55:26.400
Doesn't mean that it's valuable

55:26.400 --> 55:29.040
Look at the car. He's arriving. Look at the watch. He's wearing. Look at the girl

55:29.040 --> 55:32.720
He's with these things were hard to obtain so you presumed that they were valuable

55:32.800 --> 55:37.680
But you didn't realize that what's genuinely valuable are friendships and relationships

55:38.080 --> 55:41.840
And a comfort and a confidence in yourself and peace of mind and sanity

55:42.240 --> 55:45.760
And being able to positively impact the people around you. So it got me thinking

55:45.840 --> 55:47.920
I've been really sort of reflecting on this over the last year

55:48.960 --> 55:51.600
And I did some research into the history of the pineapple

55:52.320 --> 55:53.120
so

55:53.120 --> 55:56.320
1492 christopher columbus lands on the island of guadalupe

55:56.720 --> 56:00.160
And for the first time ever a westerner sees a pineapple and you look at it

56:00.160 --> 56:03.920
It's kind of a royal fruit that's got this stupid crown on its head and he writes in his journal

56:03.920 --> 56:08.000
He describes the taste of a pineapple if you've never had a pineapple before you blow your head off

56:08.000 --> 56:12.240
You know if you haven't got processed I remember the first time I had a pineapple. Yes, it's insane

56:12.320 --> 56:16.000
Of course, anyway, they take a shipload literally back to

56:16.880 --> 56:18.880
the prince of spain

56:19.040 --> 56:21.040
Prince aragon the second

56:21.360 --> 56:27.760
Take this entire shipload back one of them makes it that isn't rotten and the prince is allowed to eat it

56:28.880 --> 56:33.120
And again almost gets this sort of mythical quality to it the pineapple

56:33.600 --> 56:36.720
Very quickly the british quite rightly so they

56:37.360 --> 56:41.680
They start to see it as this symbol of opulence, right? They see it as this symbol of wealth

56:41.920 --> 56:44.880
So they would parade pineapples around at dinner

56:45.440 --> 56:48.560
On a platter and they would use them over and over and over again

56:48.560 --> 56:55.280
You could rent a pineapple, right for the evening. This is the sort of house in which you might be able to see a pineapple, right?

56:57.360 --> 57:00.480
Castles had pineapple statues on the top of them there would be

57:01.360 --> 57:04.000
Fountains with pineapples at the front of someone's estate

57:05.600 --> 57:10.400
All of this occurred because of the scarcity of a pineapple. It was 8 000 pounds to get one pineapple. Wow, right?

57:10.480 --> 57:12.480
That was the equivalent back then

57:12.560 --> 57:16.240
8 000 pounds. It was a symbol of of privilege and opulence and wealth and

57:17.440 --> 57:20.080
What it meant was that people really

57:21.120 --> 57:26.640
looked up to this one object then the french a couple of hundred years later. They invent greenhouses

57:27.520 --> 57:32.560
And that allows us to grow tropical fruits at higher climates higher

57:33.520 --> 57:35.520
latitudes

57:35.520 --> 57:37.520
Price drops and guess what?

57:37.760 --> 57:39.760
No one starts parading the pineapple around anymore

57:40.880 --> 57:44.240
The scarcity of it was largely determining the value of it

57:45.760 --> 57:52.640
And that story and what I called rogan's value difficulty conflation just because something is hard to obtain does not mean that it is valuable

57:53.360 --> 57:56.720
Now I would argue that a pineapple is valuable no matter how hard or difficult

57:56.720 --> 58:00.480
It's like a dialed fruit no matter how good or how difficult it is to get a hold of

58:01.200 --> 58:05.360
But I really love that insight because I think that it shows how

58:06.240 --> 58:07.680
non valuable

58:07.680 --> 58:11.280
But difficult to obtain things get slipped into our desires

58:12.240 --> 58:18.080
I see that particular expensive possession that intrinsically I don't actually care about maybe I've never been a watch guy

58:18.480 --> 58:20.800
Maybe I've never been a shoes guy. Maybe I've never been a car guy

58:21.280 --> 58:23.680
But I want it I want it because it's hard to get okay

58:23.760 --> 58:27.120
Well, what if there is a quicker route to what fulfillment?

58:27.440 --> 58:31.040
What if there is a more direct path because there are some people out there for whom

58:31.520 --> 58:35.200
Keeping up with the jonesism materialism is an inbuilt part of their life

58:35.600 --> 58:40.240
But I can say as someone that doesn't have that bone in my body particularly that for me material possessions

58:40.320 --> 58:44.160
They don't make a massive difference to my quality of life. I like nice things. I like to fly business

58:44.240 --> 58:46.080
I like you know, I like a nice house and blah blah blah

58:46.720 --> 58:52.160
But there's people who are tuned into that, right? Maybe it's the upbringing the genetic predisposition whatever whatever whatever

58:52.960 --> 58:56.320
But I think that people should be very cautious. Why is it that I'm chasing this thing?

58:56.640 --> 59:01.440
Am I chasing this thing because it's something which is valuable or am I chasing it simply because it's something that's difficult to get

59:01.680 --> 59:03.680
Yeah, that's a by the way a very good story

59:04.160 --> 59:06.160
And a great quote. I remember in iran

59:06.640 --> 59:09.760
Pineapple is on on us. That's how we say we say on on us

59:10.480 --> 59:14.960
And anybody in iran who had pineapple you were rich two things pineapple and banana in iran

59:15.200 --> 59:19.120
Only rich people have pineapple and two good fruits. Yeah, two good fruits. And then I go to germany

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
And bananas are everywhere

59:22.160 --> 59:27.280
But the first time I had pineapple. I had it in the states. I couldn't believe we were having pineapple

59:27.280 --> 59:30.640
I thought we were rich when we had pineapple. I said mom, are we finally rich here?

59:31.760 --> 59:35.760
We made we retired on a pineapple. Yeah, it was on on us and I remember I was in

59:36.560 --> 59:42.560
Ninth grade first time ever we went and ate at sizzlers. I thought we had made it. I'm like guys you will not believe what restaurant

59:42.560 --> 59:46.720
I don't know if you know sizzlers, but sizzlers in us is not a fancy restaurant

59:46.720 --> 59:48.720
I thought we made it because we ate at

59:48.720 --> 59:50.720
sizzlers. Yeah, you know what say

59:51.440 --> 59:53.440
I used to think

59:54.560 --> 59:58.320
And you know this whole concept of people who are too much about

59:59.040 --> 01:00:03.200
Fancy things it's kind of like well look at this guy all he cares about his money all he cares about his fancy things

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:06.800
All he cares about is these cars and life with the rich and famous and all this other stuff

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:14.400
Eventually I realized not everybody is driven by the same thing all I care about that's something that drives you

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:20.160
Okay, my oldest son could care less. You know what he wants for a car his favorite car a jeep

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:24.160
That's his dream car. My daughter says I want a white Ferrari

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:27.600
Okay, and I said, who do you think's gonna buy that for you? Well daddy, you're gonna buy

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:30.160
I'm not buying you white for are you gonna buy yourself a white Ferrari?

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:34.000
Dylan wants a completely different car my oldest son. You know what you know what is

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:38.000
Absolutely a great day for him outside

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:40.320
in the dirt

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:42.160
playing with lizards

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:44.160
catching animals

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:46.160
Playing with dogs and cats

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:49.440
That's an incredible day. By the way, he's been like done since eight months nine months

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:54.480
My youngest son 10 years old first time I take him to my barber to get a haircut

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:57.040
And one of the girls at this place they give

01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:01.040
Massages at the end when you get the haircut my oldest son says don't touch my back

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:05.200
Don't don't touch me. He would go like this. He's like no no dad. I don't tell her not to touch me, right?

01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:07.520
But my 10 year old son it was five at the time

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:10.080
She's like, can you also massage me over here?

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:14.000
Oh, he likes to find the things in life to find her things in life, right?

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:17.040
My oldest son loves dogs. He loves animals my youngest son

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:19.760
Don't get on my bed get off my bed

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:25.280
My oldest son wants a dog right next to him the youngest son doesn't want any of the dogs next to him and his dad loves dogs

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:26.880
I love animals, right?

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:29.200
so I'm not I'm not you know

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.440
I think

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:37.440
Joe specializes in doing the heart if there's anybody that specializes in doing the heart is joe. You kid me like joe is a

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:40.240
enamored by doing the heart

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:45.360
But also joe's learned to be so self-aware of himself to know what he likes

01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:49.520
I said joe, what do you think about sports? Is uh, I know nothing about sports. I don't watch sports

01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:51.520
The only thing I watch is ufc

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:55.760
Joe now that you're getting all these eyeballs. What's your vision? What if we can do this pat?

01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:01.120
The only thing I want to do is I just want to podcast. Yeah, I want to go hunt. I want to be my family

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:05.920
I want to do ufc. This is all I want to do the level of clarity. He has of where he's at

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:08.880
Props to him now Dana white

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:10.800
slightly different

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:14.080
Dana's not worth a few hundred say he's worth a half a billion dollars today

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:16.240
Why is he still driving?

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:20.720
Why is he still pushing? Why is he still competing? Why is he still wanting to be number one?

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:22.080
Who's his enemy?

01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:27.040
He drives around in nice cars likes to go to the casino likes to be around with people having fun late night

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:31.760
Two different dynamics two different personalities. Look at the organization they built with you

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:32.640
I mean

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:37.200
Thinking of someone who chooses their enemies tactically Dana is not someone who's shy of a fight

01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:41.200
He loves it, you know, if you were to think of a c-suite level fighter

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:46.000
Dana white is is pretty well and bring the crop. Yeah, you've you've spent a good bit of time sort of

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:49.920
Orbiting that that whole crew of people. What have you learned from your?

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:54.400
Insights about the UFC and sort of what that says about Dana. Oh

01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:58.000
listen

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.560
what I'm about to say about Dana is

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:05.680
Some people are not gonna like it, but I'm gonna say it anyways

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:11.360
UFC is what UFC is because of Dana white you can sit there and talk about all these fighters and

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:17.040
Yeah, but you know if it wasn't for this guy if it wasn't for that guy if it wasn't for what this person did and that

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:20.400
Totally get it. Listen different players come and go right totally understand

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:28.880
Dana has made it about the sport. He never made it about the fight. He never made it about one fighter

01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:31.040
He is very

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:34.240
Quick to call out anybody. It doesn't matter if it's the number one guy in the league

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:38.560
He'll call him out. John Jones. He'll call out Connor if he screws up, but he'll back him up

01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:42.320
To the highest level. He'll say that was some stupid shit. He did

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:45.760
He'll sit there and straight up tell you what he likes what he doesn't like

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:52.000
But everybody learned during covet. He was the number one commissioner in all of sports

01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:54.640
Every commissioner in america caved

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:56.560
mba caved

01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:58.560
nfl caved mlb caved

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:07.280
Every commissioner caved except for one guy who had brass balls called dano white who said I don't give a shit

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:12.480
We're going to find a place to do the fight. So during covet. You know, it's the only sport the world watched

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:16.960
We watched ufc. No one's watching the freaking football game with no fans out there and card boards

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:19.120
What am I going to do with card boards? Oh, no, we're gonna watch

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:22.000
Hey, you can buy this seat for your face to be on the you know

01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:25.680
Basketball game who gives a shit. It was the most boring finals lakers one ever

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:29.920
They shouldn't even deserve to have won that finals. There was no audience. Nobody boon against you

01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:35.840
But everybody realized here's dano as a commissioner. Then it's everybody else. You're not at his level

01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:41.280
He's a wartime leader as well as a peacetime leader. He's learned how to balance both

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:42.480
prestige moving together

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:45.840
He said something in an interview says listen, man, maybe it's just the fact that I'm getting old

01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:49.680
And I'm getting soft, but I have a hard time seeing what's going on with some of these guys and

01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:51.680
You know

01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:55.440
In the way his personal life when he went through that crisis and the way he put it

01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:58.080
He says you want me to be embarrassed? How much more embarrassed you want me to be?

01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:01.680
You know how embarrassing it is to talk to my wife and my kids. You know how embarrassing that is

01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:04.720
This is nothing compared to embarrassing the two have to face my kids

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:09.920
You respect that you love that there's a degree of clarity

01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:12.160
especially to dano

01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:13.280
that is

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:14.320
very rare

01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:15.200
and

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:19.360
I think that one of the things that ufc has done is make boxing particularly

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:26.000
Feel so antiquated and pedestrian and the fact that ksi almost speed tommy fury. You know how bad that would have been for boxing

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.160
That's not good. That's not good, but he ksi does not represent ufc either

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:37.200
He doesn't but what would have happened if a youtuber would have beaten a professional boxer with the last name of fury

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:41.920
It's humiliating correct and many people would have said he could have won on the points

01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:49.280
But what was it that you said you made some comparison about jockeys and horses to do with dano white?

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:58.000
Yes, I made the analysis with ilan musk where you either bet on the oh the same goes with dano white as well

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.640
Yeah, yeah, so you got the jockey and the horse. Okay

01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:08.240
You got dano white is the jockey the horses ufc ilan musk is a jockey

01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:17.200
Tesla is the horse. Okay, so if tomorrow ilan musk resigned from tesla to only do twitter

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:19.600
What happens to tesla?

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:24.560
It's going to be disturbing for a lot of investors because a lot of people bought tesla because it's ilan musk

01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:26.960
A lot of people are selling tesla

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:30.000
Tesla and getting rid of their cars like aoc

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:35.840
It's ilan musk ever since yeah about twitter double-edged sword. Yeah, it's a double-edged sword

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:42.000
But you know to me in a perfect world is if you can have both I think ufc is a great product

01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:46.640
Phenomenal product addicting product. Okay viral product

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:52.000
But dano white is an incredible jockey. Do you remember someone brought up?

01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:55.440
I think it was israel adesanya had been using the n word

01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:59.680
And it's at the press conference. I mean it must be fun for the press

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:04.160
You know to sit down and dano sits down. He goes. All right guys. What's going on the gate tonight was

01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:09.520
We broke this he would have the fight of the night and then he just looks up and someone asks him a question

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:14.720
And he just says what he thinks you know, he doesn't say something that the media team has prepped him on

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:18.800
Although i'm sure he's got training and he understands the boundaries, but nothing feels

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:22.080
prescribed

01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:23.920
manufactured

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:25.360
Conceited

01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:26.560
Nothing

01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:29.760
Contrived nothing feels like that. It just feels like this is what the guy thinks

01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:33.680
Someone I saw this on the internet. Someone had talked about

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:39.680
Many organizations and youtubers at the moment are trying to speed run authenticity

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:48.080
Right. They're trying to growth hack relatability. How can I make myself seem more authentic and relatable than I actually am

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:51.520
And obviously it's kind of a self-defeating prophecy

01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:54.800
Which is that the only way to be authentic is to be authentic

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:59.520
And there's a degree of trust, you know, I mean dana dude the start of this year was rough for him that

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:04.880
Him and his mrs. Got into a scuffle and it got videoed and it was maybe like new year's eve or something like oh

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:09.520
January 1st. Guess I was starting 2023 the worst way possible and

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:12.240
He comes out and you have faith that you go

01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:14.320
Yeah, this guy

01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:15.920
Meant what he said

01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:19.840
There's I don't think that there's any demons looking in the closet because I may

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:25.040
Regret saying that at some point in future, but I don't think that I'm going to need to because I just have faith that

01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:31.840
I'm not a dana white. I don't have stock in dana white. I just I'm a good judge of character and I see in him someone

01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:37.680
That seems to tell the truth more often than not and seems to be very open and honest and own his mistakes

01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:40.720
And people love that people really really like that

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:42.720
So, yeah, it makes him incredibly likable

01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:46.720
Authenticity at the highest level that brand is a very

01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:49.520
authentic brand

01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:53.040
He said is uh, you know his enemies. He's had the people that have

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:55.520
challenged him and given him a hard time, but

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:58.400
Dana in a in a past life could have been a gangster

01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:01.440
Maybe he was but he could have been a gangster. He could have ran a

01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:06.880
Family that's how Dana's he could have been he Dana is almost not a

01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:09.440
mob boss

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:12.320
You know of a Gambino family or Genovese or colombo

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:16.960
Dana's more the guy that ran the commission like a Luciano. That's Dana

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:19.680
And to be that guy

01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:25.120
There is no book you can read to be that you can read 40 lots of power 100 times you can't be that guy

01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:29.200
You either are that guy. You're not that guy big boss energy Dana is that guy Dana's that guy

01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:34.880
One of your quotes is when you're winning you're not as good as you think you are

01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:39.120
When you're losing you're not as bad as you think you are. What's that mean to you?

01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:43.840
Both of them lie, you know, both of them is exaggerated, you know, both of them

01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:46.720
are

01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:51.280
When you when you're winning everybody's telling you how amazing you are. Oh my god, let me tell you do you

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:53.600
You know what you're the best

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:55.600
You're amazing

01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:58.320
You know, you're just better than that guy and you're better than this guy

01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:03.840
And it always takes me back to that quote of Marcus Aurelius who had a slave

01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:08.720
That would sit behind them and always whisper to him. Hey, you're just a man

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:12.080
You're just a man. You're just a man. That's right 40 laws of power, right?

01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:14.160
You're just a man. You're just a man. You're just a man

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:19.440
And then he would get up and he became the best emperor what 62 ad to 69 whatever the time is

01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:22.160
And he becomes who he becomes

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:30.400
And we read about him now, you know, you pick up the book meditations. You're like, this is like mandatory reading for anybody

01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:32.720
What is this all about? Right?

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:34.560
You know a simple book

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:37.920
Not that big you can read it in one hour. No, it's not it's not

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:42.560
And you're going through it saying what was this about then you google what did he mean by this?

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:46.960
Wow, I don't think about it that way. So and then when you're losing

01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:51.360
Everybody tells you I told you shouldn't have done that. I knew you weren't gonna make it

01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:56.880
Yeah, I told you it wasn't for you. You weren't that guy and you believe that as well

01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:01.200
So both of them are are lying for me politically

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:07.120
Politically, I'm a capitalist hardcore capitalist. I fully am a capitalist to the core

01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:13.680
I think the free market will create solutions to problems. I think the free market is going to filter out

01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:16.400
all the fakers in

01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:18.960
pharma in

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:23.520
finance in podcasting in sports in real estate and insurance

01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:28.800
It takes two decades, but it'll filter people out. It's not it's got zero sympathy for you

01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:34.000
It doesn't care to be friend. You can give capitalism as many compliments as you want. He doesn't feel it. He has no emotions

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:41.040
You can't flatter capitalism. All he's interested in is results. Are you good enough? Can you last can you recreate yourself? Great

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:45.680
But when it comes on to politics, I want to hear both sides

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.520
Okay, I'm a christian, but I held a podcast four weeks ago

01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:54.640
I brought two muslims and I brought two christians and I had them go at it for two hours discussion

01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:57.440
because my

01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:02.480
Conversation was more about okay if we agree on seven different things we disagree on seven different things

01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:06.720
But you agree on 23 different things. Can we figure out a way to make this work?

01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:08.640
Why do you feel the way you do?

01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:11.920
Why do you feel the way you do and they go back and forth and your sinners in okay?

01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:16.320
Interesting to date israel palestine with what's going on with hamas

01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:19.200
complicated lots of issues

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:23.520
You know on one end the question is where pro israel

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:26.080
Where folks are going back and forth

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:30.560
You know, I'm a pro-israel guy. I'm from iran when I lived in iran for 10 years

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:37.360
Iran was safer when reza pahlavi was there because they were strong and they had allies with everybody

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:40.480
And israel was safe the middle east was safe you could go

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:44.560
And say, you know what patrick next week, you know where i'm going. Where are you going?

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:46.800
I'm going to tehran iran

01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:53.440
Because frank sinatra is performing there i'm gonna do a podcast with frank sinatra said you're doing a podcast with frank sinatra in tehran iran sick

01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:57.040
You would have been able to say that in 76 in 75

01:12:57.760 --> 01:13:01.680
So the middle east was fairly peaceful not perfect, but it was peaceful

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:05.120
But at the same time it you know, you got to ask the question

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:08.560
Had it israel with the best

01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:16.400
Intelligence masad not know that for one year hamas was training for this

01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:22.720
How did you not know that they went and built a city similar to the one that you haven't trained on how to break into homes and take hostages?

01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:25.520
You didn't know that you really didn't know that

01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:29.120
And intelligence gave you a report from here from egypt

01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:33.680
But you didn't know that it's a fair question to ask but when you ask that question guess what people say

01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:38.320
What kind of a question is that this is not the time to ask that question. Do you realize what they're doing to kids?

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:40.240
I don't support it

01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:45.120
I'm not supporting any of that stuff. Then I got another question because palestinian said that's exactly right

01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:49.440
This was intentional by israel. They know what I asked palestinians and they also don't ask this question

01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:51.120
Here's a question

01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:53.120
If you're so peaceful

01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:55.680
Who knows more about palestinians?

01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:57.120
us

01:13:57.120 --> 01:14:03.120
Who live in america or uk or your neighbor if you live in a condo or if you live in a house

01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:06.640
And you've been living in this house for five years or 10 years

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:09.360
You have a neighbor on this side. You have a neighbor on this side

01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:12.800
You know when they do barbecues, you know, how much they drink

01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:18.400
You know who in which in-laws comes in, you know the son when he sneaks in the girlfriend at one o'clock in the morning

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:23.600
You know the daughter when she sneaks out and changes her skirt and gets into a car with that bad boy and goes out and does

01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:28.320
What she does and she comes back at four o'clock. You know your neighbors. You see all their mess. Okay

01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:32.240
If if palestine

01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:36.800
In gazes filled with so many peaceful people. Why is egypt not taking them?

01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:41.920
As refugees to go to egypt egypt knows a lot about you. Why is it only 800 people?

01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:45.680
Why are they not letting a million people come to you? So somebody may say

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:52.720
What a shameful question for you to ask. How dare you ask the question? I think both questions need to be asked

01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:59.040
What you do with it is up to you. Okay, so for me this whole concept of when you're winning

01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:02.080
Don't believe the hype when you're losing. Don't believe the hype

01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:08.080
Whatever story even your own side is saying. Why don't you be skeptical a little bit and question it for yourself and see if you can

01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:09.920
entertain both ideas

01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:15.600
I want to find ways to entertain both ideas as much as possible because I find myself becoming sharper when I do

01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:18.400
That and I eliminate blind spots anytime

01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:23.520
100% one side have way too many blind spots. We'll get back to talking to patrick in one minute

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:27.280
But first I need to tell you about fountain life. Here's a crazy statistic

01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:30.560
Nearly 70% of heart attacks occur without any

01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:37.040
Prior symptoms simply put the human body is really good at hiding disease and this is where fountain life comes in

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:42.880
They provide top of the line health snapshots vetted therapeutics and a team of longevity physicians

01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:50.880
So that you can live a longer healthier and more vital life in seemingly healthy adults fountain life's initial results have shown

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:58.080
2% have cancer 2 and a half percent have a potential ruptured aneurysm looming in their future and over

01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:02.160
14% have a critical life saving finding right now

01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:07.680
You can get the exact treatment that I got by going to the link in the description below or heading to fountain life

01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:14.720
Dot com slash modern wisdom using the form on that page to get $500 off their apex membership

01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:16.800
That's fountain life dot com

01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:23.280
Slash modern wisdom. Do you think that we're obliged to have a take on everything because I haven't

01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:29.280
Got involved in the israel palestine conflict and there's a lot of people that are very unhappy

01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:36.480
The silence is violence crowd your silence is deafening. Why haven't you come out in support or against this group or that group?

01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:39.440
Is it an obligation for us all to have a take on everything?

01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:44.880
If if the background has to do anything with you, I think you are obligated to talk about it

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:49.360
Meaning if you're a jew, I think you have to if you're palestinian you have to

01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:55.360
If you're a muslim, I think you have to because it's your community. It's your pride. It's your background

01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:00.960
If you're a political show and you've spoken about ukraine and russia

01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:05.680
And you've touched that topic. Why are you not touching this topic now?

01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:10.720
I don't know if you have no no no no to all of the above then guess what that means then you're consistent

01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:15.200
So no you don't have to if you've been consistent with all of it. You don't have to talk about it

01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:19.760
That's not what the show is about you could simply say you want to hear that show go to ben Shapiro

01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:25.600
Well, what people are saying they're not saying why haven't you commented specifically what your position is what they want

01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:33.120
What they're saying is why haven't you said the thing that supports the stance that I want you to take for each of them

01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:36.240
No, why haven't I come in and done edit at all?

01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:37.280
I mean listen

01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:41.520
There there's a lot of events in the world that if you and I have to comment on all of them

01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:45.760
We don't have a life you would have to do 12 hour podcasts to cover everything on a daily basis. No

01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:49.440
But this is a

01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:54.720
Once in 50 years type of crisis that could lead to a world war three numbers came yesterday

01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:58.880
Were ray dalio, I don't know if you've sat down with ray dalio. Okay, so you know who ray dalio is

01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:01.280
He's a 20 billion dollar man built an incredible company

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:06.080
I had him on as well ray dalio yesterday said

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:11.040
The chance of world war three is officially at 50% and jayme diamond yesterday said

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.960
These are the most dangerous times we're living in decades

01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:17.680
Okay, so one may say

01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:22.400
Well, you get tens of millions of eyeballs

01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:25.120
You're no longer somebody that gets

01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:29.280
Back in the days your first show when you did were 220 people watching a mom and dad didn't watch it

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:32.640
Your siblings didn't watch your best friends didn't watch it. No now you're getting

01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:34.720
Well, that's the interesting question, right?

01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:40.800
Whether somebody with a sufficiently large platform is obligated to comment on things simply because they have a large platform

01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:44.000
And you ask why whether I haven't why I haven't if I haven't

01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:49.760
I found out about the incidents that were going on in the middle east on twitter

01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:57.840
Two days after they happened and I wondered why hammers was trending and I thought what the fuck's hammers. Oh, fuck. That's Hamas

01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:01.280
That was two days after everything had happened by this time

01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:03.360
I'd already had texts from people saying dude like

01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:06.240
Are you gonna get you're gonna do an episode on this and I was like

01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:07.600
bro

01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:13.040
The requisite amount of understanding for me to be able to add an educated opinion to this topic

01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:17.200
Is not one that I have time to do. I mentioned to you earlier on we've been traveling. We were in la

01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:21.920
We were there for two days all I did all I've done for the last week is travel

01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:27.520
Sleep research and record and I've researched very specific guests. I haven't been researching stuff about the middle east, right?

01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:30.240
So that's all I've had time to do

01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:37.360
Is it not the precise problem that people who do not know what they're talking about have given

01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:44.640
Cod psychology insights way outside of their domain of expertise and just added to the noise rather than adding to the signal

01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:48.800
And yet there is a group of people on the internet that would say no

01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:52.400
But this is so important to me that it's something that should move

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:57.520
Aside the other things that you're doing in life. And I think a final element of this is

01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:00.320
people who are chronically online

01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:03.760
Cannot understand what it's like to not be chronically online

01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:06.880
I am chronically online for periods

01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:12.880
And then I am chronically traveling around and researching and recording and going from hotel to hotel coming out to florida

01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:15.520
This is one of those periods during which

01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:18.400
There's a lot of reading that needs to be done

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:22.960
To make a comment to contribute to something that lots of people who are better educated than me can do

01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:25.200
It's the same reason I didn't comment on covid

01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:29.120
Covid was something that was happening. We did a a couple of

01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:34.640
Episodes explaining how we felt people could better work from home some mental health tools that we thought that they could use

01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:40.240
Some strategies that they could do to improve their time blocking and some stuff like that

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:43.200
Here's how we would design your homework station. I'm like

01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:48.080
If you want me to comment and just throw horseshit at the wind

01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:52.480
I can do it, but I don't think that it's going to benefit anything. So yeah, there's this

01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:55.120
compulsion

01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:57.120
this obligation I think that uh

01:20:57.840 --> 01:20:59.840
certain groups on the internet feel

01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:06.560
Anybody that comments on things should get themselves involved with and uh, it's just are you surprised?

01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:10.640
No, no at all because what they want, but again, they don't want you to comment

01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:16.320
They want you to support their side. No, that's a different story that that that's a different story. There's a difference between

01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:19.360
commenting and supporting right

01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:23.360
I'm not if I comment i'm giving you my thoughts

01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:26.160
and i'm gonna share with you my

01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:28.480
uh, uh

01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:30.480
You know opinion

01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:34.800
Thoughts on my life experience on what I think is going on and then from there

01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:38.960
Agree or disagree for the people who are asking you to contribute

01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:42.960
if your thoughts and your life experience led you to

01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:44.240
Uh

01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:48.640
Implicate one side rather than the other sound like you were being more generous to one side rather than the other

01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:52.160
They would very quickly say I wanted you to comment, but I didn't want you to say that

01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:55.760
They would very quickly have an issue. Is that your brand though? Is your brand?

01:21:56.480 --> 01:22:00.080
Uh, uh of 700 episodes 2500 clips

01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:06.320
You know is your brand given opinion on current events? Have you done that in the past?

01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:08.960
Because here's what happens. So

01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:16.000
In the market, you know how in hollywood. They say this guy's a triple threat. What's a triple threat act sing dance

01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:22.880
Okay, in podcasting. There's also triple threats. Okay. What's a triple threat a great interviewer?

01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:25.840
Which you are but that's one of three

01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:28.800
two is

01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:30.800
perspective and opinion

01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:34.880
Which joe rogan is people want to hear what joe has to say about this

01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:37.680
And in three is entertain

01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:42.640
Can you entertain me while you're giving me your perspective or asking questions where i'm kind of like

01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:48.240
Man, I was funny as hell. Yeah. So joe the reason why joe is number one is because

01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:50.560
joe's

01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:52.560
great host

01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:55.600
We want to hear his perspective agree or disagree. He has the

01:22:56.480 --> 01:23:02.400
He has the conviction and the confidence to give a side and be willing to change. Hey one minute. You're voting for bernie sanders

01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:07.200
Four years later. You're saying to save america. You got to vote for trump and republican. What?

01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:09.920
What are you talking about? Right?

01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:13.040
So then three is he entertains you he makes you laugh

01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:16.560
Your brand

01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:20.480
You have to take the risk whether you want to go to two

01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:25.120
I don't think you need to comment on absolutely everything if joe was to be asked

01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:27.680
What do you think of aron roger's most recent achilles rupture?

01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:32.160
As you said earlier on that's not a but there's a different story with that

01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:37.760
You asked about consistency earlier on ukraine russia didn't comment on covet didn't comment on and that's your brand then

01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:40.880
But but by the way, what you just said is

01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:47.120
Your perspective absolutely, but it's a meta perspective on what's going on. You're not going to please everybody though

01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:50.320
Look, i'm armenian and assyrian. Okay, so now i was born in iran. So here's where i'm screwed

01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:53.360
i'm a half armenian half assyrian born in iran

01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:55.840
And i'm an american, okay

01:23:55.920 --> 01:24:00.640
So for the emulsmen of the apocalypse. Oh my god. So whenever something happens with armenian genocide

01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:03.920
I have to within a second comment on it. Okay

01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:07.920
And I do but now within a second because I don't have intel

01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:11.280
So when you're talking about your days what it looks like research all that stuff

01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:13.280
You're telling the truth

01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:16.880
But i'm running nine companies and I got a wife and I got four kids and i'm

01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:23.280
Transitioning with another company and i'm doing research on a podcast and i'm doing the interviews and i'm running a tech startup

01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:26.480
And i'm running a consulting firm with clients that are traveling worldwide to come to us

01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:30.000
And i'm doing our our best to kind of see what's going on with stories

01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:32.800
Yeah, there's going to be days you just don't have time and the audience

01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:36.480
Can't understand and cannot understand it right? That's a decision they got to make

01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:41.040
Uh, so assyrians. Hey, did you see what happened at that theater?

01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:44.480
What are you going to comment at this wedding that just took place and a hundred people were dead

01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:49.120
And a place caught on fire and these people. Okay, great. Let me get some intel and then i'll comment on it

01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:55.920
And then I did you know or iran or you know, but but the natural part where I would take it as a

01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:58.720
compliment is the audience

01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:00.080
is

01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:01.600
leaning on

01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:05.760
You to see how you would assess this issue and they trust the way you reason

01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:09.920
And nowadays there's not enough people who are able to reason

01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:13.840
To give a different perspective because they simply don't trust mainstream media

01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:17.920
But then the next step is do you want to take the risk of going in that side?

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:24.800
If your brand is not on covet not on uh, ukraine not on this then you're staying consistent. I think largely the main

01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:29.760
Lesson I learned I learned this from douglas murray is that there are a lot of people in the online space

01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:33.760
Who do not have expertise within a particular domain and have it in another one

01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:40.560
They have expertise within psychology or climate change or whatever it might be and then they start thinking to themselves. Well

01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:43.120
Why

01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:46.720
Why shouldn't my thoughts on the ukraine be important to people?

01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:53.600
What everybody thinks that my insights about climate change are absolutely wonderful and they start to get out over the skis

01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:57.680
Outside of their domain of competence. If you want to talk about my domains of competence

01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:00.160
I'll comment on it

01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:02.160
For me, there are people out there who are

01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:07.920
Capable prepared to do the work have the time and have the expertise. I don't think that the internet needs more noise

01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:12.000
I think it needs more signal and I would be contributing nothing short of noise if I did that

01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:19.520
I'm also just not passionate about learning about this topic and I understand that in order for me to give the

01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:27.200
For me to meet the bar of evidence and insight that I would want to to feel proud about my opinion

01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:32.080
I need to be passionate about it. Right. I need to be compelled to learn about passion about life

01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:33.920
Of course I am

01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:37.040
Would you like to live 200 years old? Yes. Okay

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:41.280
So do many of your listeners because the feedback you give

01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:45.120
Has to do with living a great life because people are watching the life you're living

01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:49.040
The only thing I would encourage you to consider from the audience side

01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:51.680
Is this is a different crisis

01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:53.840
This crisis

01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:59.840
If reasonable people like you can find a way to lower the overreaction that people are having

01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:05.120
With everything that's out there. I would say you would actually contribute to lowering the

01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:07.760
overreaction community

01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:08.640
so

01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:13.680
I'm I'm simply complimenting you to consider the fact that people are looking to see

01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:20.320
How a reasonable person like you that can give a logical perspective because that's what's missing today

01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:22.000
and

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.760
When a Ray Dalio

01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:28.320
When a Jamie Dimon when many of these guys are saying 50 percent

01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:33.040
And you with your millions of people who listen to you can and it's not a

01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:38.720
Niche audience where it's in one country or two countries your audience is worldwide 100 plus countries. You got people listening to you

01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:41.920
I think maybe from that level the

01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:45.920
Feedback from the audience could be this is not a regular issue

01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:50.160
We'd like to hear your thoughts and then whether you choose to do it or not. It's your prerogative and we move on

01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:52.640
Yeah, you've got uh

01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:55.920
You mentioned there about this sort of loss of faith in our institutions

01:27:56.320 --> 01:28:00.080
Right the previous gatekeepers the people that we would have relied on to

01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:02.720
Tell us what what in the world?

01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:07.600
What do you think about this rising skepticism?

01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:11.440
Uh, there is also a degree of conspiratorial thinking

01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:15.440
heterodox cynicism around what we're being told

01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:21.120
Is this leaving a vacuum where people's uncertainty is making their lives worse?

01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:27.520
What is going to happen from a a sense making because how do people make sense of the world when we can't trust the

01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:29.680
information

01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:31.440
communicators

01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:37.920
Well, that's the that's why they want to hear from you. So so what you're saying is is validating their point. So in america today

01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:44.800
We are at the lowest levels. We've ever been for americans trusting mainstream media and trusting the government

01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:49.680
Not one or the others the lowest in both. We don't trust the government. We don't trust mainstream media

01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:56.000
The last time the the people trusted mainstream media and the government the highest was right before kennedy died after that

01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:00.320
That was at 72 percent. It's gone from 72 65 60

01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:04.560
Down to today 27 percent people simply don't trust

01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:10.320
The mainstream media to get feedback on what's really taking place. There's a reason why rogan

01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:16.560
Gets more eyeballs on his show than all these guys combined and people are watching to see what he has to say

01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:21.680
There's a reason why shepiro gets the eyeballs. He gets there's a reason why you get the eyeballs

01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:23.680
There's a reason why all these other guys get the eyeballs

01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:27.760
Is because they want to hear a different perspective, you know, we're going back to

01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:33.280
The the the story where you know in this quote's been criticized many times. It's not really true

01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:34.800
You know amateurs build

01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:39.360
You know professionals build the titanic amateurs build the arc, you know, this whole story that they go back and forth

01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:43.040
professionals run mainstream media amateurs run podcasting

01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:49.680
But the world is trusting amateurs running podcasting more than the people that build the titanic

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.800
because a lot of people think mainstream media is about to

01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:57.120
Sink like the titanic dick now whether it did or not who knows but

01:29:57.840 --> 01:30:01.680
People want to talk to somebody just a regular guy says, you know, what's your story? What do you think about this?

01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:05.840
What are your thoughts on this? Do you really agree? Do I does anybody else feel I kind of feel that way as well?

01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:08.960
I'm a little bit skeptical. I'm a little bit worried about this. What's going on?

01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:11.920
Is it really as big as they make it out to be should I trust these guys?

01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:15.360
So I'm not surprised this is taking place. By the way, you know, what's the

01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:20.640
Only thing that's keeping mainstream media in business. It's only a couple things that keep in mainstream medium business

01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:23.600
number one is

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:25.520
75 year olds

01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:30.960
70 75 year olds are keeping mainstream media in business. Okay, so that's another 10 to 15 years

01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:37.440
Before that generation is no longer here. That audience is gone. Number two is big pharma if

01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:44.560
Two countries in the world that allow big pharma companies to advertise it's us and new zealand every other country in the world

01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:46.160
You cannot advertise

01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:49.760
The only two countries in the world where pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer

01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:54.720
That can advertise is us and new zealand everywhere else. There is no commercials on tv

01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:58.960
Do you realize what would happen if a president?

01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:07.280
Did an executive order got congress everybody in it to say moving forward big pharma can no longer advertise on mainstream media

01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:09.440
You know what happens the next day

01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:11.840
Every one of them goes out of business

01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:18.560
And all these talented guys at espn or at cnn or fox or abc that are getting the 5 10 15 20 million dollar contract

01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:20.880
gone

01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:22.560
80 percent of revenue is gone

01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:26.240
And a lot of these guys now have to go and try to make it in the world that you're making it

01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:29.600
And this is what you're doing is hard. There's not a teleprompter behind me

01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:35.680
There's nobody whispering in your ears what to say follow up with this question. This is all you doing it, right to them

01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:41.680
Hey, ask him this follow up with this. We just found data 63 percent. He's lying follow up with this

01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:46.240
Did you watch any of the late night hosts when they tried to do a podcast between them? Yes

01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:53.840
What did you think from a professional's perspective a amateur professional's perspective? There's a reason why they can't do anything without writers

01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:59.040
You know, I mean don't get me wrong to me fallon is a very talented guy a very talented guy

01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:04.960
And you're not going to get to that job without having talent these guys got a lot of talent

01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:09.200
They're workers, but the moment writers are done. You mean to tell me for may 12th

01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:14.240
You guys can't do an episode until what october which they just started with two weeks ago

01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:19.360
You realize writers control this world now the writers are worried that chat gbt can write the

01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:22.880
Jokes of what's going on and what if a i can pop out these, you know

01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:28.480
Jokes and what could take place no this game is a very very hard game. This is not an easy game

01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:31.120
Think about what spot if I did

01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:36.080
What other president in the last 20 years has been as popular as obama

01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:42.960
And let me get this straight obama and another guy named bruce springsteen start a podcast and spot if I drop some what?

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:52.000
Who else has been more popular in the last 20 years on television than kim kardash in with 300 million followers on instagram

01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:56.640
Spotify signs a podcast with her then they drop her what?

01:32:57.600 --> 01:33:03.680
Who else has been more on tv and every magazine newspaper than harry and megan

01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:07.440
But spot if I drop their podcast and hasn't

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Fully is like we're not renewing the contract and then they give rogan a few hundred wait what?

01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:19.200
So let me get this straight just being famous doesn't help to have a podcast. No wow

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:24.640
I thought it was just about fame. No, this is hard. This is an art. This is very difficult to do

01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:28.000
It's not easy to do so if mainstream media

01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:30.480
Sinks like the titanic

01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:36.880
90% of that talent is going to disappear and they're not going to know what to do 90% of them

01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:41.440
It's not an easy game. There's does this mean or does this contribute to?

01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:45.440
Complicity or

01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:46.880
those

01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:50.320
Commentators and all of the other people whose wages ultimately are paid for by

01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:53.360
those adverts

01:33:53.360 --> 01:34:00.400
Does this does this create a perverse incentive for them in what way that they may be

01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:06.800
Prepared to compromise something they truly think to not jeopardize the people that ultimately pay their wages

01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:11.120
That there is a risk to them saying something out of turn which may

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:15.840
I mean are you really asking that question or you know the answer to that question? You already know the answer

01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:22.000
You're a smart guy. Yeah. No, of course they they they have to they don't have a choice to take that position, right?

01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:27.440
I'll give you an idea. Chris Cuomo was on cnn for god knows how many years and he was a number one guy for two or three years

01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:30.160
What does cnn do to chris?

01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:31.440
fired

01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:33.440
his brother andrew Cuomo governor

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:35.120
fired

01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:38.640
And then he's got a hundred twenty five million dollar pending lawsuit against cnn

01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:43.520
and now cnn folks can't talk to chris. I had him on the podcast and

01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:47.200
For the longest time Cuomo was hated by a lot of people on the right

01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:50.080
Absolutely hated because of the stuff you would say where is jesus?

01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:54.720
Jesus going to come and save you with covet. What's jesus going to do for you and all this stuff you would say, right?

01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:56.720
well

01:34:56.720 --> 01:34:58.560
He came on a podcast

01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:05.360
And i'm with one of my partners in dalas. He's a billionaire himself in the insurance, but he's the number one power player in insurance

01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:11.360
We're at his uh, uh office corner office on the top one the sickest office you'll see in your life like 60 at floor

01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:13.360
He's overlooking all of dalas

01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:15.600
brine and he says

01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:19.600
You know, it's kind of weird watching Cuomo on your podcast. I said why?

01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:22.320
He says he sounded different

01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:27.280
You know those moments where I kind of liked him when I was watching this and this is not a guy

01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:29.760
I can say something like that with you know how many people said that

01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:37.680
What happened to him? He's now a free agent. He's got a shirt. He sells that's called free agent. He's got a podcast that says, you know

01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:40.080
You know

01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:44.640
With something Cuomo project that he's got a podcast and how does he dress like you?

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:49.040
we're with him a couple weeks ago in uh, what do you call it in um

01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:53.120
sag harbor in uh, up in uh

01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:56.480
That entire area whatever that area is I forget the name

01:35:57.040 --> 01:35:59.520
uh, sagaponic sag harbor all that stuff

01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:04.640
And we'll go to his house. My kids are running on the back. He said pat somebody wants to talk to you

01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:08.800
I said, who's that facetime? It was like this like, oh shit

01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:11.840
What's up robert downey jr. How you doing?

01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:14.560
So i'm having a conversation with him

01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:20.000
But forget about talking to robert downey jr. I wanted to see my kids reaction, especially my two boys

01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:22.320
Because my boys when he died

01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:25.200
My kids were devastated

01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:31.120
When he dies iron man dies in you know in the do you know what today is in the marvel cinematic universe?

01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:34.000
Today is the canonical death day

01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:41.040
Of tony stark when he clicks his fingers today is the day the date get out of here today is the date

01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:42.320
I did not know that

01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:45.120
What is the chance of me bringing up the sword and I don't even know that story

01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:50.000
So I said dylan tico come here. So daddy will run around with the dogs. I said trust me

01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:52.080
Come here

01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:54.640
And chris turns the camera around he goes like this

01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:56.720
My son goes

01:36:56.720 --> 01:36:58.000
Oh my god

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:02.720
Zion man, I know you and then the other son tico his reaction dylan's reaction

01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:06.880
You know, you love robert downey's one of those guys that you absolutely love when you go back to his journey

01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:10.080
I was talking about the movie that my dad and I watched 30 years ago only you

01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:16.000
And the only movie I've ever watched four hours two hours and two back to back in a row was judge

01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:20.480
This by robert downey jr. What's the moral of the story the moment chris coma was free

01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:24.560
And he didn't give a shit

01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:27.120
He just kind of told you what he was kind of going through

01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:33.040
Would you like it or not? You may not agree with everything, but he's finally free a lot of these guys working on mainstream media

01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:35.600
They're not free. I mean now see took his transition

01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:38.240
And guess what he's killing it. Okay

01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:41.280
Love them or hate them when tucker puts on a show

01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:46.560
Everybody's watching what this guy's got to say. So I found out from the guys that

01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:52.560
Light and tech all of this stuff that we're doing here who understand very very very closely what's going on

01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:57.520
Bennett was it anamorphic lenses? Is that what they shot took his first thing in his garage with?

01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:05.280
Yeah, so anamorphic lenses a very particular type of lens very particular type of shooting very

01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:09.360
Uh short wide so it has the

01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:15.680
Image of maybe it was his garage or something like that or a living room with the background behind him make no mistake

01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:17.200
that is

01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:18.720
lit and shot

01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:19.680
in

01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:26.160
Cinema quality right with the facade of it being a sort of low budget thing, right?

01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:32.240
So it's this beautiful on an iphone. Yeah, precisely. It's this beautiful blending of both and uh

01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:37.040
That's exciting. I think it's exciting to see what these guys do and also, you know, I love this about

01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:41.680
Given that we spend so much time talking and and people have this

01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:48.160
Uh concern about whether or not someone's gaming the system. Are they trying to growth hack relatability? Right or authenticity?

01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:54.480
Seeing I would be lying if I said that I didn't take an amount of pleasure to see late night hosts

01:38:54.480 --> 01:39:00.960
that have got massive platforms struggle to hold a conversation together for an hour over zoom because

01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:08.480
That is ultimately the battle place of ideas, right? It's not how well can you read a script from a teleprompter?

01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:13.120
I mean, there is skill absolutely skill in being able to do that and I couldn't I couldn't do the writing

01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:16.320
I couldn't do the performance. I couldn't do the bits and the blah blah the music

01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:18.960
but

01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:25.280
Largely you are a marionette, right? That's being ventriloquized by a handful of writers and and execs

01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:28.400
Ultimately seeing what you can do

01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:34.720
When the gloves are off is more interesting to me. This is very hard. This is this is very hard because

01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:37.440
How long is your average podcast?

01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:38.400
Hour and a half

01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:39.200
Okay

01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:46.160
So an hour and a half of keeping people's interests with no breaks and nobody talking to you and touching up the makeup to them

01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:53.040
What are you talking about? That is absolutely insane to do something like that. No

01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:58.000
This is very hard and the market is proven that this isn't for everybody

01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:04.160
The market is proven. You cannot keep my attention for that long. This is very very difficult when when people start to say

01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:06.160
and I remember I hired a

01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:07.520
marketing expert

01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:12.800
You know 13 years ago 14 years ago. He came in and said well studies. I've shown you're making one of the mistakes

01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:15.520
You're making on youtube your videos are about 12 minutes long

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:19.280
And the only videos that do well is 12 minutes after 12 minutes that I said nah, man

01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:22.880
I'm doing 42 minutes 28 minutes hour and 20 minutes. That's a mistake

01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:26.400
Number one thing we have to do is no video can go past 13 minutes

01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:32.880
Like dude, okay, maybe this guy's the expert. He sold this company for a couple million. You know what happened the day we fired him

01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:37.840
60 days later our first video goes viral and gets 40 million views today

01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:42.640
It's got a half a billion views. Okay for the life of an entrepreneur in 90 second takes off, right?

01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:48.400
And we start making other clips and other videos and other stuff and ec joe takes it to a whole different level

01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:53.360
Three hours and you got lex freedman takes it to a different level four hours three hours and 48 minutes

01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:56.240
You know, yeah, what lex does he did seven hours with balaji

01:40:58.160 --> 01:41:00.160
Glutton for punishment

01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:03.840
Yeah, you um you tweeted something that I thought was quite interesting

01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:10.240
You said why do so many people who come to the america from other countries with little to no money at all?

01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:15.200
within 10 years outpace the average person who was born here

01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:24.320
What is going on where americans who have all of the i'm an immigrant to this country, right?

01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:30.560
Many people who are given from the very beginning all of the benefits of being from this country

01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:34.640
Why is it that they are outpaced by people who weren't born here?

01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:37.520
so

01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:39.040
Six seven months ago

01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:43.360
I'm sitting with my state planner and one of the fears I have for the last 10 years is

01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:46.720
What i'm going to do with my kids with the wealth with money?

01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:49.520
Am I raising them in a way that they're not going to turn out being the

01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:56.080
You know the snobby arrogant kid that you know the spoon. Oh man, I cannot say I never liked those kids in school

01:41:56.160 --> 01:41:58.560
Those are the kids I got into fights, but I never liked those kids

01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:03.360
So I don't want to raise those types of kids and then you go and read these books about which families

01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:08.800
Generationally created a wealth that state like Vanderbilt raised a bunch of snobs

01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:13.920
So Vanderbilt's money only lasted one generation generation later. There's no money left

01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:17.440
So when you read the story about that anderson cooper's a Vanderbilt

01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:21.040
But his mother said even though we were Vanderbilt don't expect any kind of trust fund baby

01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:23.760
You ain't got no money here. Nothing's coming over till you got to make your money

01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:29.680
You know and but you look at the medici family and what they did five six seven generation

01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:32.560
What did they do differently? You look at Rockefeller still has the money

01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:36.400
You look at some of these other families that kept the money within the family

01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:40.800
What did they do? What did they structure and there's a state plan and we can go do, you know

01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:47.680
10 15 20 50 thousand dollars then there's hot guys. You can hire. That's a hundred thousand quarter million a million dollars

01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:52.400
But those are state planners when you hire, you know what they do they interview your kids

01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:56.000
so they go sit down with your kids and

01:42:56.800 --> 01:43:00.960
After they talk to you and they'll say how do you want to set the stuff for the money with your kids?

01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:04.720
Who gets money? What do they need to do? What's the criteria or your gift to get this?

01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:08.640
What kind of cars do you now want them to buy to waste the money? Who do you want it to work for?

01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:11.600
What happens with this business? Can they lose all the money? Are you given equally?

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Here's what this family and they give you all these suggestions on how to properly set it up

01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:20.080
Once you and your wife agree on what you want to do with that wealth

01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:23.680
These guys have meetings with all your kids

01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:26.160
without you there

01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:30.880
And they'll record it so you can see how the meeting went went but they're setting it up with them

01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:32.880
So they'll say okay kids. This is uh

01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:36.080
On behalf of your parents, here's a few things you need to know

01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:37.920
number one

01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:42.000
Um, the good news is your parents are very prepared on what they've done with you

01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:44.960
And here's what you can get your parents have worked very hard

01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:49.280
And they have made a lot of money and if you do it, right? Some of that can be passed over to you

01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:52.720
But if you don't you're not going to get it either. Let me go through some of these criteria

01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:58.320
These three things you do you're not going to get anything these two things you do

01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:02.720
If you do this, here's what's going to happen. This is what they want to see use the money with

01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:04.880
And then they kind of break it down to them

01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:05.520
now

01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:07.520
You know how many families actually do that

01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:11.920
Very few those conversations most people don't have most people are so much about go go go go go go go go

01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:17.520
And then you die unexpectedly. Oh, we didn't set up the state planning let alone the detail the state planning. No

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:22.400
Okay, now your kids are spoiled right and doing what they're doing. I've had this conversation with a number of friends

01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:26.720
Ben Francis who is the CEO of gymshark his net worth is triple drakes

01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:31.840
Um, he's the start of a guy by the way. He's a serious. I had him on the podcast a couple years ago start serious dude

01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:35.360
Yeah, uh, I was talking to him and I think that it's the same with you

01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:42.000
One of the things that you value the most in your upbringing have been the hard times the spit and sawdust

01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:45.440
Lessons and rules the hard school of hard knocks, right?

01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:50.000
That's given you the work rate that has permitted you to be able to achieve the success that you have and

01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:56.960
Reverse locally reverse entropy, right? So you've been able to wrangle your reality in a way that you want it to

01:44:57.600 --> 01:44:59.600
Mm-hmm. And yet

01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:04.000
You have worked so hard to be able to give your kids

01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:10.640
Opportunities that you never had. Mm-hmm. And yet, you know that they need to go through the hardships

01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:15.440
And that those are where the lessons are learned that are going to bear them. This to me seems like a very

01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:21.680
Uh, interesting tension, right? I want to give my kids opportunities that I've worked so hard for if I don't

01:45:21.760 --> 01:45:26.560
What the fuck was the point in you working so hard, right? And yet they need to go through the difficulty

01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:31.680
They need to do how have you found this tension between the two?

01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:32.960
Well, that's a great question

01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:35.760
But I want to finalize by making a point when you ask the question about

01:45:36.160 --> 01:45:40.400
Why is it that so many people come to america within 10 years to have more money than the people that were born in america?

01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:42.720
because

01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:44.720
unfortunately

01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:49.680
The way we've ran america if the american-born kids

01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:53.200
Are kids of these families?

01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:55.920
They're the kids of the families that spoiled

01:45:56.560 --> 01:45:58.560
them in america

01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:03.200
There's no more earning things in america. It's just handed out to them. We're printing money left and right

01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:08.160
We're giving away income to people left and right. We're making life easier

01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:15.680
We're incentivizing the wrong things. Do you know in 1940 in america what percentage of kids were born to single mothers in 1940?

01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:17.680
in america

01:46:17.680 --> 01:46:22.320
What percentage of kids were born to a single mother who's not married with no father in the household?

01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:27.200
4% is the number. Did you know the number or no? It's 4%. You know what that number is today?

01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:29.040
Over 50

01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:32.000
It's over 40 shy of 50 percent. You're right there at the number

01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:37.120
You mean to tell me we went from 1944 percent to today. So what happened there?

01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:38.720
first of all

01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:40.320
policies by fdr

01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:46.880
Social security and incentives of taking care of single mothers then linden johnson in 1965 took it to a whole different level

01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:51.440
Mothers are sitting there saying the more kids I have the more entitled programs. I get great. Why would I get married?

01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:53.760
If I get married, I lose those benefits

01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:56.320
The incentive programs america set up

01:46:57.040 --> 01:47:02.400
Totally screwed everything up. It incentivized the bad behaviors like telling a kid

01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:09.280
Can you imagine if you're in estate planning you say for every kid you have not married? I'll pay you 700 dollars

01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:11.920
Whose fault is that parents fault?

01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:15.520
Bad policies have consequences. Yeah, you create a bad policies

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.480
What person in the right state of mind?

01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:22.560
When they have their wealth america's a family. It's a corporation

01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:28.400
What person in the right mind would incentivize what parents would incentivize kids to say i'm gonna have more kids

01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:31.920
And i'm gonna give you money out of the living trust nobody in the right mind would do that

01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:34.880
But america did so what happened to us now we got all this crime

01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:39.280
Now we're paying the price for it because all these years there's no father in there to

01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:42.800
Put him in their place to challenge him to straighten them up. That's not in place

01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:46.160
You know, so that is a missing piece that these kids

01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:48.400
Don't have in america

01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:54.240
So to me if we looked at america as a family as a corporation estate planning matters

01:47:54.800 --> 01:47:58.400
You know living trust matters the right policies matters

01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:03.920
Listen, I even think to the point where you know how in america voting starts at 18 years old

01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:07.920
I would much rather this was a very

01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:12.880
Strange policy i'm gonna share with you when I posted this on on youtube a lot of people very upset with me

01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:15.280
I would much rather

01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:18.080
Have somebody who's 14 and a half years old

01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:20.720
Who's had a job?

01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:23.840
And paid a thousand dollars in taxes vote

01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:28.480
Then a 28 year old kid who's never had a job

01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:32.560
Never paid taxes. I don't want that guy to vote. Why?

01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:39.200
Because he contributed to society the 14 and a half year old kid the 15 year old kid contributed to society

01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:42.720
And realized how hard it is to pay the taxes into

01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:46.400
Whatever they're spending money on you want to spend a hundred billion dollars to

01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:49.200
Ukraine we could have built 20 walls

01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:54.400
We could have built 20 walls with that money that was sent you're not saying ukraine. I'm saying this so you're safe

01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:56.720
Don't worry. They're not they're not gonna come after you. They're gonna come after me

01:48:57.360 --> 01:49:01.760
So all of these things that you look at we're going away from earning

01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:04.400
When a immigrant comes here

01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:08.480
All they're looking at saying wait a minute. I can go work this and do this and do this and do this and i'm gonna earn this

01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:11.680
Yes, i'm going i'm going town all day. I'm good with this

01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:17.040
Many americans don't have that mindset because bad policies have consequences that we're suffering

01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:21.200
Uh, uh the negative impact of that but you ask the follow-up question

01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:24.720
Right with kids and your question is how to balance it with

01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:28.800
Challenge in them yet still having the opportunity. What was the question you were asking?

01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:33.440
Yeah, the tension between you affording your kids the benefits that all of your hard workers

01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:38.640
Allow them to do and some greetings. I'm very greedy and here's what i mean by i'm very greedy

01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:41.360
I want my kids

01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:43.360
As close to me for the rest of my life

01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:45.680
We have a family that lives in our community

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:49.520
Uh message just bought a house right next to our house and he just moved into the community

01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:52.480
He caused a lot of mayhem. It's all over the place cops are coming in every week

01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:55.920
We have you know, what do you call it paparazzi craziness that's going on

01:49:56.080 --> 01:50:01.600
But one of the families that lives in our community they they run a medical company with six seven thousand employees

01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:05.360
So the the founders the mom and dad their house is here

01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:08.240
Right next door to the house

01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:13.680
They have two sons the other son lives here. Who's the chief marketing officer? They're all the son's house is here

01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:16.560
Each son has four kids

01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:18.960
Each son has four kids

01:50:18.960 --> 01:50:25.200
Both sons are doctors both sons married someone who's a doctor and they each have four kids

01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:29.040
They have a structure on what they do monday nights every tuesday night

01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:34.320
They have dinner together and they talk about god everyone's there's a system to everything they do

01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:38.400
He'll call me and say hey, we went fishing this morning. I got a bunch of fish. Can I drop it off to you?

01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:44.560
I am enamored by how those parents created that kind of a structure where their kids are respectful

01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:49.840
Their grandkids are respectful go on a halloween. We're walking in halloween doing trick or treating and

01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:52.400
The

01:50:52.400 --> 01:50:58.160
Son comes by 17 year old son comes by and he says yeah, he doesn't have his iphone with him

01:50:58.640 --> 01:51:01.760
I said, how does he know it not have it not have his iphone with him? He says in our family standard

01:51:01.760 --> 01:51:05.040
It's very easy. You want your phone you got to have straight a's he's got to be

01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:10.800
I said, well, let me get to straight your 17 year old son doesn't have a phone because he doesn't have one

01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:13.200
Because he has one because yeah, it's our standard

01:51:13.520 --> 01:51:16.800
I said, what are you talking about? This is very simple. You just got to make sure you got straight a's

01:51:17.120 --> 01:51:19.120
You'll get a phone you get the car you get this

01:51:19.520 --> 01:51:25.280
Now somebody's going to listen to this and say what what a freaking extreme set of standards. That's tyranny. That's tyranny

01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:31.760
That's exactly the type of kids that end up becoming da da da. No problem. It's called standards and expectations

01:51:32.160 --> 01:51:34.720
And for a family who has the ability

01:51:35.280 --> 01:51:38.480
To use money and waste it and do whatever they want to keep that kind of standards

01:51:38.480 --> 01:51:42.080
I respect that even more and guess what the son loves his father

01:51:42.640 --> 01:51:45.440
Loves his mother loves their grandparents respectful kids

01:51:45.840 --> 01:51:47.840
So it's it's not easy to do

01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:50.960
But if it matters to you eventually in my life when I say I'm greedy

01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:55.680
I would love to create a proposition for my kids. We're 20 years from now. They want to run one of the companies

01:51:55.680 --> 01:51:56.720
I want to be within the company

01:51:56.720 --> 01:52:01.040
They want to work with one of the companies and I like them to live close to me. Will it happen

01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:06.480
It's going to take us 30 years to find out because dude pan generational housing. I'm seeing it in austin, right?

01:52:07.280 --> 01:52:12.160
Commune or ranch where someone's buying up a ton of land and then there's another one of those puppies down there

01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:16.320
If you want to they're buying up a ton of land and we're going to not just have us

01:52:16.400 --> 01:52:18.320
We're going to have somebody else come and live with us as well

01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:22.480
We're going to have grandma and grandpa and they're going to be that this is the way that it was

01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:25.600
This is the way that it was and here's another thing to consider, right?

01:52:26.400 --> 01:52:31.280
Would you rather have drinking too? Going to do anything to me or no, what's you're going to survive?

01:52:31.360 --> 01:52:34.320
You're going to be dialed in you're going to survive. I promise

01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:37.520
Whatever whatever the internet throws at you. You'll survive. So

01:52:38.480 --> 01:52:40.480
What is the uh

01:52:41.200 --> 01:52:45.840
Yeah, so we've got that's citrus that one's orange one sunrise. Okay, yeah wild citrus so

01:52:47.680 --> 01:52:50.400
One of the interesting questions that you have here would be

01:52:53.920 --> 01:52:57.760
Would you rather have a parent who pities you more than they believe in you?

01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:03.440
You didn't do well. It's okay. That teacher doesn't understand

01:53:03.920 --> 01:53:07.280
Let me pat you on the back come here little timmy will take you for ice cream

01:53:07.440 --> 01:53:09.440
Or would you rather have a parent who says

01:53:10.480 --> 01:53:12.640
I believe in you more than more than I pity you

01:53:13.920 --> 01:53:18.160
I mean look, I'll tell you my dad very annoying man. Okay

01:53:18.880 --> 01:53:20.320
because

01:53:20.320 --> 01:53:22.960
Never sympathized never felt sorry for anything

01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:27.200
Never it was always stands on expectation, but he always loved me

01:53:27.680 --> 01:53:30.720
So when I was six years old and my teacher asked me what do you want to be when you grow up?

01:53:30.720 --> 01:53:34.080
I said I want to be a father. Why I said because I want to be like my dad

01:53:34.640 --> 01:53:39.040
I had a very good dad. My dad's still with us. He was in a hospital this week, but he's out. He's doing good. He's at the house

01:53:39.760 --> 01:53:43.520
Kids love him. Everybody loves him. My kids all have a relationship with him. He's 81 years old

01:53:45.200 --> 01:53:48.880
It took a lot to please my dad my dad wasn't impressed by anything

01:53:49.280 --> 01:53:51.280
He wouldn't be there and say, oh my gosh

01:53:51.360 --> 01:53:55.520
And by the way, he's a middle eastern father, which means I've never played catch with the guy

01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:01.600
We've never thrown the football. We never played anything. No sport. Why why he just he was a worker since eighth grade

01:54:01.600 --> 01:54:06.640
He dropped out in iran and started working to take care of his mom and dad. Their family was very very close

01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:12.400
You know, but again, remember how earlier on when we're talking about, you know, choosing your enemies wisely

01:54:12.960 --> 01:54:16.560
We talked about how the the top performers have

01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:18.320
a

01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:24.080
Person that gave him unconditional love and one that brought a lot of pain and then they chose their enemies wisely

01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:26.960
I think

01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:29.760
The role of a person that is gentle

01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:35.280
And another one that nothing's ever good enough is a great combination

01:54:36.080 --> 01:54:40.960
I think if both parents are gentle, that's a problem and I also think if both

01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:47.200
Parents are nothing's ever good enough is also a problem. Yeah, I think you need a little bit

01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:50.080
There's a reason why the creator god

01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:52.720
Created the dynamics that he created

01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:57.280
You know, I have a one of our guys we're spending our photographers with us

01:54:57.680 --> 01:55:00.560
And he's holding his daughter while we're doing a photo shoot this Saturday

01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:03.280
And she keeps asking for mom

01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:06.880
She keeps asking I said she's she daddy's girl. Oh, it's just now. It's all mommy

01:55:07.360 --> 01:55:10.000
I said, when does she want you whenever she's scared? She comes to me

01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:15.600
So the kid runs to daddy when she's scared but goes to mommy when she's hurt

01:55:16.720 --> 01:55:20.640
That's your interesting dynamic. How it is she feels safer

01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:23.920
By dad when there's a risk

01:55:24.880 --> 01:55:29.920
But feel safer by mom when she's hurt because she's gonna be pampered and taking care of it. Yeah

01:55:30.640 --> 01:55:35.360
I think that's very healthy combination. There was a quarterback bread far many years ago

01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:39.840
I don't know if you know, bear bread far. He's a famous texture. That's an inside joke if you know who he is but

01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:44.560
He has his quarterback

01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:46.560
He has his coach so tough on him

01:55:47.360 --> 01:55:51.440
So tough on him. Nothing was ever good with this quarterback kicking his ass

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:56.400
Talking shit to him in the sideline. How could you throw that interception? What the fuck was that all about?

01:55:56.400 --> 01:56:00.320
What was that all about and he's afraid of the coach and he's always escaping the coach

01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:04.240
But there was a guy that was I think his name was mariochi stave mariochi

01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:08.480
And he would always put his arm around and listen. He believes in you. Why don't you prove him right?

01:56:08.960 --> 01:56:12.640
Deep down inside. He believes in you go through the past that you know, he knows he can throw

01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:15.920
Show him exactly what we got. Let's go win this game for him. Let's go

01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:22.800
So that dynamic worked incredibly well for bread far as well as many other players out there

01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:24.560
So I think

01:56:24.560 --> 01:56:28.000
You know one without the other is a problem if you got both. It's a great combination

01:56:28.880 --> 01:56:30.960
Yeah, there's a lot of problems with

01:56:30.960 --> 01:56:32.960
fatherlessness in homes

01:56:32.960 --> 01:56:36.400
Melissa carney just wrote a new book called the two parent advantage

01:56:36.880 --> 01:56:42.960
Two parent privilege. Sorry and uh, dude, it's terrifying just the raw data the raw outcomes that you get

01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:47.920
Your mom and dad stay together. Yes. Okay. Uh, we till today. Yep only child

01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:52.400
So only child only child. Do you have the only child uh syndrome? Yes. What do you mean?

01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:54.960
The guy that's the center of all of these lights and stuff

01:56:56.320 --> 01:57:00.800
In some regards, okay in some regards. Yes, but I think I had quite a stern upbringing

01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:07.440
I was held to incredibly high standards. Uh, it was very non-rebellious as a kid. Um, non-rebellious very non-rebellious

01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:11.440
Very very non-rebellious. Um, you know, wasn't going out wasn't sneaking out

01:57:11.680 --> 01:57:14.640
I don't think I ever got grounded once the god play role or no

01:57:15.360 --> 01:57:19.680
Standards and expectation was a tough standard high very high. What did your mom and dad do?

01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:26.880
Dad is an engineer mom stopped working for probably 10 to 12 years to raise me while dad was out working

01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:30.640
Uh, but this isn't you know, dad was on the working class of most working class

01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:36.160
We live in a a city in the uk that was famous only for having the highest teen pregnancy rating in the uk

01:57:36.320 --> 01:57:40.880
And then it lost that so it didn't even have that as a as a title anymore at least you could brag about it

01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:44.240
Now we got nothing to talk about. Yeah, we haven't even got that. Yeah, uh, so

01:57:44.880 --> 01:57:47.920
But it was it was very formative and you know, I'm just thinking more and more

01:57:48.720 --> 01:57:51.760
About this tension between success making people soft

01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:57.040
Uh, I spoke to David Goggins about it on the podcast, you know, he's this guy who can command

01:57:58.080 --> 01:58:04.000
Millions of dollars for speaking gigs and he's choosing to go smoke jumping. Have you seen this thing that he's doing?

01:58:04.240 --> 01:58:09.120
So smoke jumping is when there's a wildfire in the middle of nowhere and they need to air drop in

01:58:09.680 --> 01:58:13.040
The firefighters so they parachute in with a

01:58:13.680 --> 01:58:19.360
Pack around their waist with all their stuff on and they also put water huge

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:25.840
Water bucket things that they'll attach their hoses to separately parachute them in and they just live in the fire

01:58:26.160 --> 01:58:29.200
Until they put it out. Sometimes they're out there for a week pretty sure he makes

01:58:29.920 --> 01:58:31.920
It's either seven or twelve dollars an hour

01:58:32.560 --> 01:58:36.720
That he makes for doing this smoke jumping as it's called. It's in canada for the most part

01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:41.600
Instead of going and doing this speaking to it and I asked him about success making you soft

01:58:41.840 --> 01:58:46.640
He says I see it way too much and that's why I don't like it. I'm not about the flash

01:58:46.640 --> 01:58:48.800
I'm not about any of that when the best books in business

01:58:49.280 --> 01:58:54.240
Was written by a legend see legendary ceo in silicon valley

01:58:54.720 --> 01:58:58.080
Who ran intel? I think he's the only guy that for a decade straight

01:58:58.080 --> 01:59:03.840
He grew the company a hundred percent every year unheard of what this guy did and the growth hungarian guy

01:59:04.080 --> 01:59:07.520
Okay, you know what the book's title is only the paranoid survive

01:59:08.400 --> 01:59:13.840
Only the paranoid say that before so I had a question to you around only the paranoid survive

01:59:15.760 --> 01:59:17.280
I don't disagree

01:59:17.280 --> 01:59:22.400
That paranoia is an unbelievable competitive advantage. It's a very useful performance enhancer, right?

01:59:22.480 --> 01:59:27.280
You are paying more attention. You are more detail oriented. You're more fearful

01:59:27.920 --> 01:59:29.600
all the rest of it

01:59:29.600 --> 01:59:34.080
Ultimately, is it worth it? Do you think is paranoia worth it as a life strategy?

01:59:34.800 --> 01:59:38.880
It the you are protected by those who take that seriously

01:59:39.360 --> 01:59:44.000
Okay, you know burden is not something that's a sexy sell

01:59:44.640 --> 01:59:48.480
You know, there's a lot of things that you and I can sell that's very sexy

01:59:48.960 --> 01:59:55.520
Okay, work from home very sexy yet the loneliness epidemic in america right now is record breaking numbers

01:59:55.520 --> 01:59:57.520
we've never seen before right on

01:59:58.320 --> 02:00:04.560
What people are doing how lonely they are numbers on depression is off the charts right now compared to what it was just 10 years ago

02:00:05.360 --> 02:00:06.240
So

02:00:06.240 --> 02:00:12.160
Yeah, you can sell work from home. You can sell three and a half day work week. You can sell

02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:14.800
Laptop entrepreneur. You can sell

02:00:15.760 --> 02:00:18.240
These are all sexy things to sell right you can sell

02:00:18.720 --> 02:00:22.240
Set up a funnel and make 20 grand a month and don't have to do anything

02:00:22.640 --> 02:00:26.560
These are all very interesting easy things to sell try selling burden

02:00:27.200 --> 02:00:29.040
go ahead and sell burden

02:00:29.040 --> 02:00:37.120
Oh, dude of the incredible honor of having burden of the responsibility of a nation or a state or a military or freedom

02:00:37.120 --> 02:00:38.320
I thought was a

02:00:38.320 --> 02:00:43.280
Try selling it. It's no, but it's not an easy sale. It's a hard sale. Responsibility isn't sexy

02:00:43.440 --> 02:00:48.160
So why are so many great leaders turned on by that burden?

02:00:49.040 --> 02:00:51.040
Why because someone's got to do it

02:00:51.120 --> 02:00:53.120
So it all depends, you know

02:00:53.120 --> 02:00:55.600
In the in the book your next five moves I talk about how

02:00:56.160 --> 02:00:58.480
The most important question you got to answer in life is

02:00:59.040 --> 02:01:00.480
Who do you want to be?

02:01:00.480 --> 02:01:03.840
What type of life do you want to live? That's simple. Okay, so what does this mean?

02:01:04.400 --> 02:01:07.120
Do you want to be a founder? Yeah, you sure?

02:01:08.240 --> 02:01:09.680
Yeah

02:01:09.680 --> 02:01:13.520
Positive I think so it's kind of cool right want to be a founder entrepreneur

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.800
You sure you want to be a founder? You sure you want to be the number one guy?

02:01:16.800 --> 02:01:19.840
Tom Ellsworth who is my business partner said one the best things to me

02:01:20.400 --> 02:01:21.920
this guy was at

02:01:21.920 --> 02:01:26.800
Talk about the legendary interview of all time. It's the last interview of steve jobs and bill gates in silicon valley

02:01:27.040 --> 02:01:28.240
Okay, wherever it was

02:01:28.240 --> 02:01:32.800
300 people were invited at this meeting tom was one of them said recorded. It's record. You got to see it

02:01:32.800 --> 02:01:37.520
By the way sick. It's the red chair when you see the red chair. You're watching the right one steve jobs is super skinny

02:01:38.240 --> 02:01:41.280
Tom Ellsworth tells me says pat it took me 50 years to realize

02:01:42.240 --> 02:01:44.400
I don't make a lot of money when i'm the number one guy

02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:47.120
The most money I ever made

02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:49.120
Is when I was number two through number six

02:01:50.560 --> 02:01:52.400
Think about saying that

02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:56.720
I think about taking 52 years to realize 50 years to realize the most money you ever made

02:01:57.280 --> 02:01:59.680
Was when you were the number two guy or number six guy?

02:02:00.240 --> 02:02:02.240
Because there's burden with number one

02:02:02.400 --> 02:02:04.080
Number one has got to sell the dream

02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:05.840
Number one has got to sell the vision

02:02:05.840 --> 02:02:08.320
Number one has got to seem like even though we're about to go out of business

02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:12.320
They're at peace. They're calm. They carry the burden sleepless nights

02:02:12.960 --> 02:02:17.760
Your finances you can't reveal to people if you're about to run out of money. We're gonna make the expenses

02:02:17.760 --> 02:02:23.200
We're gonna make salaries. We're gonna pay payroll. That's the number one person who wants that burden. Nobody wants that burden

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:27.120
So no if the idea is to sell that

02:02:27.920 --> 02:02:29.920
No, it is not an easy sale

02:02:30.160 --> 02:02:34.240
but if you want to know why you right now are here

02:02:34.960 --> 02:02:37.840
And we are able to do this podcast at a

02:02:38.880 --> 02:02:41.360
Pretty unstable time in the world today

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.480
It's probably because around 500 people

02:02:45.280 --> 02:02:49.520
Have the burden of making sure nobody messes with you and I where we are right now

02:02:49.920 --> 02:02:51.920
And those 500 people have

02:02:51.920 --> 02:02:56.480
A thousand people underneath them or 500 people underneath them why you and I are able to sit here

02:02:56.720 --> 02:03:01.760
So it's not the most sexy attractive thing like in in smithsonian. I don't know if you've been to the smithsonian in dc

02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:04.240
There's a part where you go and it shows

02:03:04.880 --> 02:03:08.720
You walk this way. It shows how lincoln aged over

02:03:09.440 --> 02:03:14.080
It's an incredible thing to see and there's a quote they buy by lincoln about burden

02:03:14.960 --> 02:03:18.480
Okay, the the being a president is the greatest burden

02:03:18.960 --> 02:03:22.400
A person can never have right some some quote like that. I'm paraphrasing

02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:25.600
So it's not for everybody and it's not a sale the person chooses to do it

02:03:25.920 --> 02:03:27.920
Obama before and after

02:03:28.160 --> 02:03:32.320
His eight years right. He still looks good though. Oh, he's still got he's still got swagger

02:03:32.320 --> 02:03:34.320
But I mean that was 20 years in eight years. That's right

02:03:34.800 --> 02:03:41.520
So this is something I wanted to talk about you have spent a lot of time reading about and researching and speaking to

02:03:42.240 --> 02:03:44.240
powerful people

02:03:44.320 --> 02:03:46.320
Who do you think really runs the world?

02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:50.560
You're gonna go there, huh with the question. Who do I think runs the world?

02:03:50.640 --> 02:03:52.640
Um

02:03:52.880 --> 02:03:56.000
So I used to ask the question I said who who's got the most power in america?

02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:00.000
Is it congress is a president is it the CEOs of virtual governments?

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
We're talking google twitter facebook

02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:06.240
You know those guys amazon, you know, or is it billionaires?

02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:12.080
Okay, you know the most richest man in the world. Who's got the most power and you'd be amazed how few people said president

02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:14.400
Does it come and go?

02:04:14.400 --> 02:04:18.000
You know the famous quote with putin that he says, you know

02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:21.920
American presidents you don't have to worry about it. They're gonna be there four to eight years

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.800
Some suits are running, you know and run the country behind closed doors

02:04:25.360 --> 02:04:28.320
And he's got a very good point when he says something like that putin

02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:31.040
but to me

02:04:31.040 --> 02:04:33.040
There are a lot of

02:04:34.800 --> 02:04:40.800
Alliances being built so if you and I were to think about aspirational type of people, okay, you know how they say

02:04:41.760 --> 02:04:46.240
You know, well michael jackson eventually got to a point where he got so many different girls that he started trying with this

02:04:46.240 --> 02:04:50.320
And he started trying with this and a lot of these people in hollywood have so much sex with so many different people

02:04:50.320 --> 02:04:53.760
That they become creative and they do dumb things, right? Okay

02:04:54.640 --> 02:04:56.880
Tiger woods the reason why he got these girls because what do you know?

02:04:56.880 --> 02:05:00.320
What it is to be the greatest golf golf in the world and everybody throws their panties at you

02:05:00.720 --> 02:05:01.920
You want to judge a guy like that?

02:05:01.920 --> 02:05:04.960
Why don't you go be the greatest golfer and see what it feels like to be one out of eight billion?

02:05:05.200 --> 02:05:08.400
You don't know what it's like. So they're kind of trying and experimenting with all this stuff, right?

02:05:08.720 --> 02:05:12.240
It's almost like i'm so much in a prison jail. Everybody's watching what i'm doing

02:05:12.240 --> 02:05:14.720
I'm going to break the rules a little bit to see what i'm capable of doing. Okay

02:05:15.440 --> 02:05:21.360
So so let's go process and dissect some of these guys that make all the money in the world. Okay, you become a billionaire

02:05:23.600 --> 02:05:29.760
And you're still dangerously ambitious not from a good place, but more selfish place

02:05:31.280 --> 02:05:34.880
Okay, you took over an industry now you're worth five billion dollars

02:05:35.120 --> 02:05:40.160
Now you were 10 if you're a billionaire, you're the best at what you do in your space for the most part or you help build

02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:43.200
The best in that space for the most part. Okay

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
cool, so

02:05:47.120 --> 02:05:50.640
Maybe your marriage didn't work out. Maybe you're not the best father in the world

02:05:51.920 --> 02:05:53.920
And you're like, well

02:05:54.800 --> 02:05:57.440
I want more control. I want more power

02:05:58.720 --> 02:05:59.920
I can't be a president

02:05:59.920 --> 02:06:02.240
I don't want to be a president because if I run for president

02:06:02.240 --> 02:06:05.920
They're gonna reveal the things that i've done in my life and god forbid if that gets all the light

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
I don't want that that's embarrassing

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.880
But you know what i'm gonna do? What if I can take over the world?

02:06:13.680 --> 02:06:17.920
Are there other people like me that are driven by wanting to take over the world?

02:06:18.800 --> 02:06:22.880
What if we could make the world one place and we make all the decisions for everybody because

02:06:23.920 --> 02:06:25.840
I'm probably one the smartest people in the world

02:06:26.560 --> 02:06:29.520
I'm proud and you know that conversation is taking place again

02:06:30.320 --> 02:06:34.400
You really start having that godlike figure like I don't know if you're familiar with george soros

02:06:35.120 --> 02:06:40.480
You know in one of the interviews he gave to la times. He says I always fancied myself would be in a god

02:06:41.440 --> 02:06:43.200
I fancied myself would be in a god

02:06:43.200 --> 02:06:47.680
This is an la times interview 20 plus years ago if you type in george soros la times god

02:06:48.240 --> 02:06:52.320
It's the most disturbing interview to read about this guy a lot of people are very skeptical about him

02:06:52.320 --> 02:06:56.720
Right, he's like the boogie man of a number of conspiracies. How many how many people have you heard say?

02:06:57.760 --> 02:07:00.160
I always fancied myself with being a god

02:07:00.800 --> 02:07:02.400
he says but

02:07:02.400 --> 02:07:06.800
What's great about where i'm at right now is it's no longer a

02:07:07.760 --> 02:07:09.760
Dream it became a reality

02:07:10.400 --> 02:07:13.440
I have a friend who has spent a lot of time with

02:07:13.760 --> 02:07:18.400
Super super powerful people and he told me about a meeting that he had with one individual

02:07:18.960 --> 02:07:22.880
In particular who spoke about being an apex predator

02:07:23.360 --> 02:07:27.200
He said that apex predators don't care about prey and even though

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.480
The prey that he was referring to was still his own species

02:07:31.680 --> 02:07:36.720
It was really haunting the story the way that that was told to me because you had someone who not only

02:07:37.520 --> 02:07:39.520
Had the motivation

02:07:39.680 --> 02:07:42.080
to be able to go and enact whatever

02:07:43.040 --> 02:07:45.040
nefarious malicious plan

02:07:45.360 --> 02:07:49.680
But also had the actual resources to be able to go and do it right those two things together are

02:07:50.480 --> 02:07:54.080
They're scary and that was something that really opened my eyes

02:07:54.160 --> 02:07:58.560
I'm very non conspiratorial in the way that I think I always lean toward

02:07:58.800 --> 02:08:02.080
You know do not attribute to malice that which can be explained by stupidity

02:08:02.160 --> 02:08:05.760
Do not attribute to coordination that which can be explained by coincidence

02:08:06.480 --> 02:08:07.680
Uh

02:08:07.680 --> 02:08:10.960
And yet the more that I read and the more that I learn about things

02:08:11.920 --> 02:08:14.320
The more there there seems to be there

02:08:15.040 --> 02:08:16.640
right

02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:19.760
Yeah, you know people are offended by different things

02:08:23.840 --> 02:08:30.000
Some people being offended in their deepest insecurities

02:08:30.240 --> 02:08:35.600
They're willing to use their ambitions to go to certain levels

02:08:36.320 --> 02:08:38.320
That at that point they're not

02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:44.240
Thinking about the consequences of ruining a lot of people's lives. That's not something they're thinking about at that level. So

02:08:45.360 --> 02:08:49.680
Hitler was offended when you read my comb for you study what Hitler did. He was simply offended

02:08:50.320 --> 02:08:55.440
Somebody offended him. So his entire life was about doing what he did just because he was offended

02:08:56.320 --> 02:08:59.600
Now most people who are offended they do what they forget about it

02:09:00.240 --> 02:09:03.840
And they move on some of these guys want control some of these guys

02:09:04.480 --> 02:09:09.520
Want to make decisions for you some of these guys on the money side at least they go and make money to get power

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:14.400
Some people don't go make money to get power. Some people cloud swab. They're like no, I'm not going to go make money to get power

02:09:14.880 --> 02:09:19.280
I'm going to get power by creating laws and thinking. I know what's best for you

02:09:19.920 --> 02:09:23.120
So there's a lot of different people that you can put in these steps of organization

02:09:23.120 --> 02:09:25.120
You just have to think like if you were to think about

02:09:25.680 --> 02:09:30.880
The commission of the mop always go back to it. Lucky Luciano created a commission with the five families

02:09:31.200 --> 02:09:33.600
He was the one that ran the commission right up the five families. Okay

02:09:34.240 --> 02:09:39.680
When you think about what meetings in the world happens where all the powerful people show up you get the g20

02:09:40.480 --> 02:09:45.840
You got the un you got the world economy. You got davos. You got all these guys that come together

02:09:46.480 --> 02:09:48.080
You got nato

02:09:48.080 --> 02:09:49.440
you got

02:09:49.440 --> 02:09:51.440
So nato could be like well nato's

02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:56.640
Original when the 12 or 14 countries were part of nato. What was it really all about to fight ussr?

02:09:56.880 --> 02:10:00.400
There is no ussr. Why are we still funding it? What's the outcome now?

02:10:01.040 --> 02:10:06.480
Are we still fighting communism? So what a lot of people might say is that those organizations are

02:10:07.280 --> 02:10:10.400
So obvious that they can't be the ones where the real shit's happening, right?

02:10:10.400 --> 02:10:15.520
That's just the smoke screen the real shit is the shit that's behind it and the shit that's behind that and so on and so forth

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.640
In your opinion, do you think that nato wef

02:10:19.440 --> 02:10:22.240
who that's those people there's no

02:10:23.120 --> 02:10:30.480
Further upset of strings that are playing the ventriloquized game behind those ones. Do you think that that's where a lot of power actually lies?

02:10:31.440 --> 02:10:32.640
um

02:10:32.640 --> 02:10:37.120
I don't know what I will say listen to you is with the questions you're asking

02:10:37.840 --> 02:10:38.880
I think

02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:43.440
There's a reason why the audience wants to hear what you think about what's going on right now because you're asking some heavy questions

02:10:43.680 --> 02:10:46.880
Right now, which means you're curious and if i'm the audience

02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:52.640
I would like to know what you can come up with if you took a deeper dive and really wanted to get into these types of

02:10:53.120 --> 02:10:54.880
you know informations but

02:10:54.880 --> 02:10:56.880
you know

02:10:58.080 --> 02:11:00.640
Think about what things people are most addicted to

02:11:01.280 --> 02:11:05.520
Okay, addictive personalities video games porn sex

02:11:06.160 --> 02:11:07.280
cocaine

02:11:07.280 --> 02:11:08.880
ecstasy

02:11:08.880 --> 02:11:10.640
weed

02:11:10.640 --> 02:11:12.000
steroids

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:13.440
party in

02:11:13.440 --> 02:11:15.440
all of that stuff

02:11:15.440 --> 02:11:17.440
But what's one of the most addicting things?

02:11:18.560 --> 02:11:21.600
That many of those guys can't get power

02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:24.240
Are you kidding me power is like

02:11:24.800 --> 02:11:26.240
power

02:11:26.240 --> 02:11:27.600
porn

02:11:27.600 --> 02:11:29.600
The porn of having a lot of power

02:11:30.160 --> 02:11:35.040
And getting the look and people that look at you that are afraid of you some people love that

02:11:35.920 --> 02:11:40.640
Some people love that you know the quote like if you really want to test someone's character given power. I mean some people

02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:42.480
really

02:11:42.560 --> 02:11:47.440
Love having power take a company and see some of the guys that they hired they hired a wrong person at the top

02:11:47.840 --> 02:11:49.840
The guy was all driven by power. What happens?

02:11:50.480 --> 02:11:56.720
Take a president that becomes a president and he realizes he can use the justice system against his opponent. What happens?

02:11:57.280 --> 02:11:59.840
They got that power. It's a lot of power to give to somebody, right?

02:12:00.800 --> 02:12:02.080
um

02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:05.920
Yeah, so you know those people I believe are out there some of them are

02:12:06.720 --> 02:12:12.000
100 money people because money talks and you can have a lot of you need funds to do anything, right?

02:12:12.160 --> 02:12:14.240
You do it's it's going to be the money people

02:12:14.880 --> 02:12:15.840
um

02:12:15.840 --> 02:12:21.680
But there's also the other power players behind closed doors that you know in the in the movie money ball

02:12:22.400 --> 02:12:26.080
Uh, Jonah Hill plays that. I don't know if i'm saying his name correctly. He plays the role

02:12:26.720 --> 02:12:28.160
of the guy that

02:12:28.160 --> 02:12:29.760
Brad Pitt is sitting there saying

02:12:29.760 --> 02:12:32.800
Why is this gm of cleveland indians keeps looking at the guy?

02:12:35.120 --> 02:12:40.160
Doesn't gotten based who the hell are you right in john john maxwell or or

02:12:40.640 --> 02:12:43.440
Dale Carnegie wrote about this in a book saying the law of e.f. Hutton

02:12:44.480 --> 02:12:47.920
E.f. Hutton was in the room that every time the guy was making a decision

02:12:47.920 --> 02:12:49.920
He wouldn't make a decision until he asked about e.f. Hutton

02:12:50.560 --> 02:12:53.520
So here's what we're going to do. So what's your proposal? Okay, great

02:12:54.320 --> 02:12:56.320
Hey, e.f. Hutton, what do you think about it?

02:12:56.560 --> 02:12:58.560
Okay, we're not going to be doing it great

02:12:59.360 --> 02:13:03.680
The world is filled with like henry kissinger. I don't know how much you know about henry kissinger

02:13:03.760 --> 02:13:06.320
That guy's an e.f. Hutton if there ever was one

02:13:07.440 --> 02:13:08.800
There's a lot of

02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:10.880
those guys

02:13:10.880 --> 02:13:12.320
that

02:13:12.320 --> 02:13:17.840
Are the brains behind the faces that we see and most of the times the best e.f. Hutton's

02:13:18.400 --> 02:13:20.400
No one ever finds out who they were

02:13:21.600 --> 02:13:23.600
No one ever finds out who those guys are

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.400
one of the other tensions that I felt when

02:13:27.200 --> 02:13:29.520
Learning about you and also when watching your content

02:13:30.240 --> 02:13:32.320
You've spoken about this specifically to do with kobe

02:13:32.560 --> 02:13:37.840
But I think it also probably plays a role in almost everybody's life is this tension between self love and high standards

02:13:38.240 --> 02:13:42.000
Right, it's the desire to maximize everything you can and to not leave

02:13:42.560 --> 02:13:48.720
More on the table than you need to and also the ability to enjoy the moment and to be able to actually take some some pleasure in that

02:13:49.280 --> 02:13:52.800
And there was a something that came up from a friend that I wrote about this week

02:13:52.800 --> 02:13:54.640
So I wanted to explain this to you

02:13:54.640 --> 02:13:56.640
He did a psilocybin journey in

02:13:57.120 --> 02:14:03.280
Australia and a question came to him and the question was do people love you for who you are or for what you do

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
This is uncomfortable to consider

02:14:06.320 --> 02:14:10.480
People loving us for who we are feels more real genuine caring empathetic and robust

02:14:10.720 --> 02:14:13.520
It feels like we're less fickle and more difficult to lose

02:14:13.840 --> 02:14:17.600
On the other hand people loving us for what we do feels transactional and transient

02:14:17.840 --> 02:14:22.560
The love that we receive becomes contingent on what achievements and successes we can offer in return

02:14:22.960 --> 02:14:27.520
And the obvious fear is that if a point came where we no longer had anything to offer in return

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
Would our love be taken away?

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.240
So here's an even more uncomfortable question

02:14:32.800 --> 02:14:35.840
Do you love you for who you are or for what you do?

02:14:37.120 --> 02:14:38.640
This highlights our hypocrisy

02:14:38.640 --> 02:14:44.480
You see we want the world to love us for who we are a balanced caring view of our true value independent of our accomplishments

02:14:44.960 --> 02:14:48.960
Meanwhile, our own self-love is largely determined by what we do

02:14:49.520 --> 02:14:52.080
If we fall short even though we know we tried our best

02:14:52.320 --> 02:14:55.440
We still castigate ourselves for being insufficient, unworthy creatures

02:14:55.840 --> 02:15:00.880
So we want the world to show up for us in a way that we are often not prepared to show up for ourselves

02:15:01.280 --> 02:15:04.080
You demand more than this demanded of yourself

02:15:04.960 --> 02:15:06.960
powerful

02:15:06.960 --> 02:15:12.880
Do you see that resonating this tension in high performers desire for more requirement for self-love?

02:15:14.400 --> 02:15:16.400
Yes, but for me

02:15:17.120 --> 02:15:19.120
There's a part of it. That's also honest

02:15:20.080 --> 02:15:24.240
Because again the relationship with between a man and a prostitute

02:15:25.440 --> 02:15:27.280
What is that relationship?

02:15:27.280 --> 02:15:29.280
Each side is getting something in return

02:15:29.920 --> 02:15:31.920
The prostitute is getting what?

02:15:31.920 --> 02:15:39.680
Money, what's the man getting pleasure? Okay, and they walk away. It's done. It's a very honest relationship, right?

02:15:39.680 --> 02:15:44.640
There's no depth in that relationship. It's straight up. It's honest done. We move on. Okay

02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:50.640
Working at a company

02:15:51.120 --> 02:15:53.120
Say you work with a company

02:15:53.680 --> 02:15:58.800
And he helps the youtube channel go to the next level doing all the work behind closed doors all this stuff

02:15:59.920 --> 02:16:01.920
Would he do that job for free?

02:16:02.320 --> 02:16:07.040
Or would he do it because you're offering something back to them? How many of my employees would be with me?

02:16:07.760 --> 02:16:09.760
If it was working for free

02:16:11.280 --> 02:16:16.960
That non-profit would be kind of weird guys. What we're doing is very important, but I need you to work for free

02:16:17.840 --> 02:16:22.240
What do you mean? Are you gonna make money? I am but I want you to work for free. It's kind of weird, right?

02:16:22.240 --> 02:16:24.560
There needs to be an exchange again. It's honest

02:16:25.360 --> 02:16:27.360
exchange, okay

02:16:27.920 --> 02:16:29.600
Um

02:16:29.600 --> 02:16:34.560
If I go above and beyond everybody else and I work should I deserve the right to get paid more?

02:16:35.440 --> 02:16:39.920
Yes, okay. Is it beneficial for me to work with somebody like you?

02:16:40.320 --> 02:16:42.400
Of course, why because you're driven

02:16:42.800 --> 02:16:47.600
So should I hang on to your co-tail because if I go with you big things are gonna happen in my life? Absolutely

02:16:48.080 --> 02:16:54.720
Is that a selfish decision? Yes, but it's also a wise decision. Do you know that you know that do they know that they know that

02:16:55.440 --> 02:16:59.760
Do they also know that you have options because now you're at a point that a lot of people would love to be working for you

02:16:59.760 --> 02:17:02.400
Of course, they know that they're not dummies, right? They know that

02:17:03.040 --> 02:17:07.440
Okay, but you still choose to stay with them and they still choose to choose to stay with you

02:17:07.840 --> 02:17:12.800
Is there benefit of somebody hiring your person that's helping with your podcast and paying twice as you pay to go with them?

02:17:13.200 --> 02:17:14.720
there is

02:17:14.720 --> 02:17:16.720
If he chooses to take that

02:17:16.880 --> 02:17:18.880
Just for the money. That's his loss

02:17:19.280 --> 02:17:23.840
If you're doing your part, he was never in it for believing in you. It was only about the money part

02:17:24.800 --> 02:17:31.440
So these are all and the reason why this is so interesting what what you're reading about self-love and all these other things

02:17:32.160 --> 02:17:36.800
Is when you look at some of the people that make it at the highest of the highest of the highest level

02:17:37.360 --> 02:17:40.000
They typically have been backstabbed so much

02:17:40.560 --> 02:17:44.480
That in the back of their mind, sometimes they're just waiting to see who's going to backstab next

02:17:45.040 --> 02:17:49.600
So so the desire to have a straight up relationship is no longer the same. Okay

02:17:49.920 --> 02:17:52.720
There's a difference between you dating somebody who falls in love with you

02:17:52.960 --> 02:17:55.280
And you're making 22 bucks an hour working at ballies

02:17:55.840 --> 02:18:00.240
And she loves you and she stays with you. There's a difference between you getting married when you're making

02:18:00.960 --> 02:18:02.640
$300,000 a year

02:18:02.640 --> 02:18:06.560
And then there's a difference between you making marrying somebody when you work half a billion dollars

02:18:07.040 --> 02:18:10.720
How do you know the girl that marries you at the end is worth? You know is with you because

02:18:11.840 --> 02:18:18.080
She loves you versus she loves what you offer them, right? And is that a sin? Yeah, is she making a mistake? You know

02:18:20.320 --> 02:18:22.320
I think in an ideal world

02:18:23.200 --> 02:18:29.040
I am very comfortable knowing that other people are also there in your life to get what they can out of you

02:18:30.880 --> 02:18:32.880
I'm very comfortable with that

02:18:32.880 --> 02:18:35.040
Because there's a chapter in the book here

02:18:35.600 --> 02:18:40.560
Where I talk about choosing running mates and I put a clear criteria on how to choose a running mate

02:18:41.040 --> 02:18:44.320
You know what they bring to the table their level of trust with you

02:18:44.800 --> 02:18:47.840
All these ways of scoring people in your life to see hey

02:18:48.320 --> 02:18:53.040
Is this a person because the whole concept would choose a new enemies wisely also need to choose your allies wisely

02:18:53.520 --> 02:18:58.080
So somebody like you you need true believers in your life. You can't have 50 true believers

02:18:58.160 --> 02:19:01.680
That's just naive to think that you can't have 10 true believers

02:19:02.160 --> 02:19:07.520
Can you have two to five true believers? Yes. How how valuable is that a lot? So

02:19:08.320 --> 02:19:11.280
No, I uh, you know the more and more I moved up

02:19:11.840 --> 02:19:16.720
The more I realized almost everybody like and I'm talking 99 percent of people

02:19:17.360 --> 02:19:21.520
Listen to the radio show wiifm. What's in it for me?

02:19:22.080 --> 02:19:23.120
and

02:19:23.120 --> 02:19:27.600
A part in this book that we dissected your question, which is fascinating question is

02:19:28.400 --> 02:19:31.840
In in the company. I've been running a sales organization for 20 something years

02:19:32.320 --> 02:19:36.880
And when I started the insurance company in online, we grew it from 66 agents today. We have 50 000 agents

02:19:36.880 --> 02:19:39.380
We've licensed nationwide. We have a few hundred offices nationwide

02:19:39.380 --> 02:19:41.380
but

02:19:42.020 --> 02:19:43.620
my

02:19:43.620 --> 02:19:47.860
Idea of looking at who's got the biggest upside to contribute to the company has also changed

02:19:48.420 --> 02:19:50.420
It used to be men that guy so selfish

02:19:51.620 --> 02:19:55.140
All that guy cares about money. I mean this guy's the nicest guy in the world

02:19:55.860 --> 02:19:57.460
and then I realized

02:19:57.460 --> 02:19:59.460
the nicest guy in the world

02:19:59.780 --> 02:20:01.780
Who had no selfish desires

02:20:02.420 --> 02:20:04.420
Was happy making five thousand dollars a month

02:20:05.940 --> 02:20:08.500
And so then I created a scoring system

02:20:09.380 --> 02:20:14.500
What percentage of you is selfish and selfless and what's the good balance?

02:20:15.220 --> 02:20:17.220
If you're a hundred percent only you

02:20:17.220 --> 02:20:22.660
And everybody else zero well, guess what you're still a bigger net positive to society than the person at the bottom

02:20:22.660 --> 02:20:27.860
That's what zero percent selfish and a hundred percent selfless if a person is a hundred percent selfless

02:20:28.500 --> 02:20:31.780
They probably don't eat well. They probably out of shape. They're probably not healthy

02:20:31.780 --> 02:20:34.420
They're probably gonna have to go to the hospital. It's gonna cost you money and taxes

02:20:34.660 --> 02:20:38.020
They probably smell because they don't take a shower. They spend their money on everybody else

02:20:38.660 --> 02:20:40.660
So then you'll see the profile

02:20:40.660 --> 02:20:45.700
Good people to give you counsel or around the 50 50 range. You can always trust them to give you counsel

02:20:46.420 --> 02:20:50.660
Drivers of a company or somebody like you doing what they do 70 30 is a good split

02:20:51.300 --> 02:20:53.700
Okay, 80 20 is a little bit problematic

02:20:54.180 --> 02:21:00.340
Because 80 20 sometimes will compromise to beat everybody. So you want the 65 70 so so you're asking a technical question

02:21:01.060 --> 02:21:02.500
and

02:21:02.500 --> 02:21:04.500
I've just come to a conclusion

02:21:04.500 --> 02:21:05.540
that

02:21:05.540 --> 02:21:06.580
you know

02:21:06.580 --> 02:21:10.500
Both parties if they want to selfishly be pleased

02:21:11.380 --> 02:21:13.380
if we can please each other

02:21:14.020 --> 02:21:19.460
And one of us takes the lead and we're getting mutual love and benefits out of the relationship

02:21:20.900 --> 02:21:24.980
You're in a good situation every once in a while you'll find somebody that's going to be a writer that they're going to say chris

02:21:26.020 --> 02:21:30.340
Dude, no matter what you do and with you till the day you die and you think they're telling the truth

02:21:31.540 --> 02:21:33.540
A year goes by they're still there even more

02:21:33.780 --> 02:21:37.300
Five years go by they got married like one wing and money gets married and ask you it's going to change

02:21:37.380 --> 02:21:41.540
Still there 10 years later still there you're like this guy's really a true believer. Wow

02:21:42.100 --> 02:21:44.820
But it's not going to be that many people. That's a very short list of people

02:21:45.940 --> 02:21:51.380
