1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
What's do most people get wrong when they think about happiness they think that they can be happy and

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,040
Happiness is not a destination. It's a direction

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,840
One of the most important things that we've lost

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,960
Sido particularly in the current generation of young adults is thinking that if you're unhappy for any particular reason

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,120
Something's wrong. Something's abnormal and that's completely incorrect

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,680
We have negative emotions for a reason that they make us feel unhappy the negative emotions are signal

7
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,080
That something's aversive outside of us and that's not gonna change

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,360
We need sadness and anger and fear and disgust furthermore

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,760
We actually need negative experiences so that we can learn and grow

10
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:44,320
Happiness is a direction and therefore we shouldn't be trying to attain happiness

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:51,000
We should be trying to attain happy urness, which is obviously a neologism, but that gets the point across that's that's mistake number one

12
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:58,360
What is an analogy that people can use to understand how happiness isn't a destination?

13
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:05,760
We we think of happiness as a thing we think of happiness as a feeling a state an affect that we arrive at

14
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,920
What's a what's another way that you can explain this

15
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,920
Disquieting of what happiness is

16
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:20,800
Happiness as we talk about it is really a state compared to something else and it's a long kind of a number line

17
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:26,480
We we're getting happier means happier than what is what it comes down to and it's just it's a it's kind of a

18
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:32,040
It's a status in which we have these macro nutrients more or less in equilibrium

19
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,240
You'll never be perfectly healthy, but you can be healthier

20
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,720
You you're never going to eat a perfectly nutritious diet, but it can be more

21
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:47,200
Nutritious than yesterday. What's more nutritious than yesterday? Well, you have a good for example macro nutrient balance to your diet

22
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:53,600
I'm a healthy nutrition nerd as are you and and we know that you you got to get your macros right

23
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:00,000
You have to have you be paying attention to your protein carbohydrates and fat and have them more or less in balance and proportion and relative abundance

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,400
The same thing is true for your happiness. So I start happiness discussions by saying there's three macro nutrients for happiness

25
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,320
Just like there's three macro nutrients for food that you have to get right

26
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,320
They are enjoyment

27
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:18,440
Satisfaction and meaning those are the three things to pursue and everybody can get better at those three things

28
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,320
That's an analogy that people can actually particularly people that would be wanting to improve themselves

29
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:28,040
That's why they're listening to modern wisdom that they would actually help them understand the whole process

30
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,240
What is the truth behind people who try to be happy and make themselves less happy?

31
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,520
What they're trying to do is to feel good all the time, you know back in the 60s

32
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:44,200
Uh, you don't remember this. I barely remember this the hippies used to say if it feels good do it

33
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,720
I remember my dad hearing that and saying that's the end of america

34
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,880
He was kind of right

35
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:55,080
The problem is that that people still think that feeling good is

36
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:02,280
Is is the happiness state and they're trying to feel good all the time as opposed to having a a tangible set of goals

37
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,720
Like I am going to enjoy my life in a better way

38
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,280
That's more stable and it's not just looking for pleasure

39
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:15,000
I am going to try to achieve things in my life with goals and direction that gives me adequate access to satisfaction

40
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,440
And I am going to do what it takes to find the meaning of my life

41
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:24,920
Even if it hurts those are strategies that actually lead us to live a much better life with actually a lot more happiness

42
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:31,640
Right. So what is the relationship between feelings and happiness then because presumably this uh

43
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,920
conglomeration of different contributing macronutrients

44
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:42,680
Arrives us at a state of some kind. There is an outcome of some kind if that isn't happiness

45
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,600
What is it?

46
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:50,200
So feelings are evidence of happiness like the smell of your dinner is evidence of dinner

47
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:56,920
What happens is if you're you're you're achieving these states adequate states of enjoyment satisfaction and meaning

48
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:04,200
You will get a better mood balance such that you're enjoying more joy and interest and you know a positive surprise

49
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:09,960
And you're you're suffering less from avoidable levels of disgust and sadness and anger and fear

50
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,160
And that mood balance will be evidence that you're actually on the right track with the macronutrients that you're getting

51
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:21,320
In the same way by the way, chris that you'll have a lot more energy if your macronutrients in your diet are are actually on point

52
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,280
right, so in this way

53
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,960
Is it advisable for people to sort of turn the bar stool upside down and think

54
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,800
Rather i'm not happy. That is a problem to

55
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,480
My current state is not one i would describe as happiness

56
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,960
That's an indicator that one of the three macronutrients is missing from my life diet

57
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,960
That's right and and every single person i've ever met in my whole life and i perhaps besides the dalai lama

58
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:54,440
Has has issues in their macronutrient profile that can lead to progress. This is really good news by the way

59
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:00,280
You know one of the most deleterious things that we say to young adults today and our kids is you're perfect just the way you are

60
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,520
What could be more depressing than that?

61
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,600
It's like i feel i feel

62
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,200
Garbage and you're telling me i'm perfect just the way i am that means i can't make progress

63
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,320
The truth is everybody can make progress because i've never met a single human being

64
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,200
That is perfect in enjoyment and satisfaction and meaning and i have a whole set of protocols

65
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,280
That will help people understand where they can make progress and where they need to make progress

66
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,000
What is the

67
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
current state of modern

68
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,280
Happiness what does the research tell us because we're hearing stories

69
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,640
Feelings of listlessness and hopelessness and disconnection and all the rest of it

70
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,920
What is the weather report for 2024 happiness?

71
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,600
so

72
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,760
Well like the owl was saying that in the in the advertisements your results may vary

73
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,040
Because you can be doing a lot right when society isn't unfortunately society

74
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,520
As we understand it particularly in the oecd countries in the western industrialized countries

75
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,240
Happiness is going in the wrong direction and we actually understand why but here the basic data

76
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:05,080
Most of the western countries the industrialized nations have been ticking about a half point down

77
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,000
Every year in the percentage of the population that says i am very happy about my life

78
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,400
so typically you know going back to about

79
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,560
1980s 1990 in the united states for example

80
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:20,360
About 35 percent of the population said i'm very happy about my life

81
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:26,280
About 15 percent said i'm not happy about my life and the other half was i'm somewhat happy

82
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,160
That's kind of the general proportions and there's better ways to measure it with greater granularity but that gives me an idea

83
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,560
What's happening you've been finding that that's ticking down so such that for the first time now

84
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:41,240
Not happy is higher than very happy and that's consistently happening now over the past few years

85
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,400
So that's been just this gradual decline now. Some people are getting a lot happier

86
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,240
But society in general is seeing this and this is largely being

87
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:56,840
Pulled down by certain demographics. You find young adults are less way way less happy than they used to be especially young women

88
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:01,160
Especially young women with very progressive political views. They're

89
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,520
I mean really really declining and there's one little subgroup, which is men my age

90
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:11,960
That and and this has to obviously this has to do with macroeconomic factors, etc, etc

91
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,160
so

92
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,960
This is these are interesting questions from a kind of a policy perspective a sociological perspective

93
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,760
But more importantly from a psychological and personal

94
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,880
Strategy perspective such that we can live better lives

95
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,200
What do you lay the decline of happiness at the feet of psychologically?

96
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,960
There's kind of climate factors and weather factors and I don't mean that literally that's a metaphor too

97
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,800
It's kind of like you and me dating is a metaphor

98
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:41,080
So the climate is the climate of faith family friendship and work in this country

99
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:47,160
Those are the habits of the happiest people. There's tons of literature out there that give you 10 000 happiness habits

100
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,600
Okay, but they're all trivial compared to the big four, which is your faith or life philosophy

101
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,920
Though the y of your existence

102
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:00,200
Metaphysically that will make you small and the universe large. You must transcend yourself

103
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:05,160
You'll be stuck in the tedious psychodrama of of christness. I mean, it's like it's

104
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,680
It's great for a minute but 24 hours a day you're going to lose your mind

105
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,920
You need to zoom out is the bottom line and I've got a bunch of ways that you can do it

106
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,200
I've got to have a folder full of ways that you can actually achieve this which

107
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,760
Up to and including the faith of your youth

108
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,040
But not not exclusively second is family life

109
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:28,840
Family life is critically important and is woefully neglected and it's societally increasingly neglected as well

110
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,400
Which which is accounts for a lot of this decline

111
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:37,320
Friendship friendship is actually getting harder and harder to come by we find that more people say nobody knows me well

112
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,640
And last but not least we have more of a dysfunctional relationship with work than we've had in the past

113
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,800
It's less like a vocation. It's less like a mission. Those are the climate factors

114
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,040
I know you're going to want to talk more about specifics in each one of those silos

115
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:56,760
Then there's the storms the storms have been have created down drafts of happiness from which we have not recovered in

116
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,000
2008 to 2010 it was screens smartphones social media

117
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:07,240
Especially among young adults. This is we understand the brain science on how this is incredibly deleterious to happiness

118
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,960
Second starting in about 2014 across most OECD countries

119
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:19,640
But really in the united states and the uk was the was the culture war was the incredibly polarizing ideological conflicts where

120
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:27,960
Malignantly narcissistic political and media leaders were conscripting child soldiers into their culture war by saying if somebody

121
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:32,040
Disagrees with you politically. They're denying your right to exist

122
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,400
And you must hate them unbelievably terrible for happiness

123
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,600
And last but not least was the loneliness that came from the coronavirus epidemic

124
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,400
For young adults that were coming of age

125
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,680
Synaptically in the plasticity of their brains

126
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:50,440
They literally didn't learn how to make friends and and have proper in-person love relationships

127
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,120
Which is probably the worst thing that's happened to happiness in the last hundred years

128
00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:00,600
Why hasn't happiness been so robust that it's bounced back? What has locked in these losses in the market?

129
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,640
Well, if you if I could do one thing for somebody to make them happier one thing

130
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,880
It's eye contact and touch

131
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:12,440
That's the one thing. Why because you know, the neurophysiology is straightforward. You've talked about this on your show

132
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:17,320
The the the neuro peptide of connection is oxytocin

133
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,600
It's intensely pleasurable and and again, we don't want to be reductive about the brain chemistry

134
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,840
But this is a really important thing for us to understand. We're a kin based species

135
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:32,920
We know hours and hours know us and we get pleasure from being close to our kin such that we are averse to

136
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,320
Walking the frozen tundra and dying alone

137
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:43,160
Okay, that that natural impulse is actually guided in no small part by this neuro peptide that functions as a hormone in the human brain called

138
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,600
Octitocin

139
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,320
We don't get it when we don't have eye contact and touch

140
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:52,680
How do you not get eye contact and touch by conducting your friendships through an iphone?

141
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,760
with social media

142
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:59,400
By going to school on zoom by never going into an office man

143
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,760
I mean, it's it's it's crazy

144
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,440
Look, if I were in austin we'd be doing this in person because it would be it would be better

145
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:09,640
And it would be better because we'd have more eye contact and because we'd be getting more oxytocin over the course of this conversation

146
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,120
Young people who've never gotten that have wired their brains differently

147
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,560
And the result is it's not clear that they're ever going to be able to recover from what we've done

148
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,560
Not I mean, I don't I don't mean to be you know catastrophic about it, but

149
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:31,320
I'm not entirely convinced that this that we're not losing a generation to oxytocin deficit and lowliness

150
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,520
this

151
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,600
is bad news

152
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,480
predictably for

153
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,120
the

154
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,120
lone ranger sigma male

155
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:47,880
Guys out there who don't need friends and i'm going to make it on my own and it's too hard to get out there

156
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:54,840
And I'm just going to retreat myself to my little digital cabin in the woods and not spend any time together

157
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,880
It's one of the reasons why I'm such a

158
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,680
a critic of cynicism on the internet that

159
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,600
Things won't get better and people who say that it can are the problem

160
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,480
It is so

161
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,720
I mean look if you have managed to convince yourself that things aren't going to get better and

162
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:19,480
You are robust in your thinking and it's not going to change. All right, whatever like I don't want you to

163
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,840
Leave society but so be it but it's fucking evil for you to convince other people

164
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,280
Of the same like you for you to somehow convince other people that no it's not there's no

165
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,680
Point in trying to get into a relationship. There's no point in trying to have friends

166
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,480
There's no point in trying to contribute to society. All right

167
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,600
Well, I mean like all of those things will very reliably make you miserable and you're basically saying

168
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:48,680
My philosophy is the one to follow despite the fact that we know the direction. It's going to take you in

169
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:53,400
Yeah, yeah, you know, let me let me let me make sure that I'm not I'm not actually guilty of that

170
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,280
By saying that I'm worried about losing a generation

171
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,880
You can rewire your brain the question is whether or not that you have this is that the society is

172
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:07,640
Is giving us adequate opportunities to do so and if it isn't take those opportunities yourself

173
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,680
nobody is permanently lost if they actually will will

174
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:16,760
Will do what actually needs to be done and adopt the attitudes that show that for example

175
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,880
You're better off when you're around people you need real friends

176
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,440
You'll be a lot happier

177
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,920
All the young men listening to modern wisdom if you fall in love and get married and have children

178
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,440
You'll be happier. You'll be a lot happier. It's not true what the red pill community is telling you that you'll be

179
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:39,240
Subjugated and miserable your whole life. I got the data trust me on this. This is the whole point

180
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:45,400
I'm worried about losing a generation precisely because the messages are coming out that these things are stupid and don't make sense

181
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,360
That's the wrong set of of messages

182
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,120
I want to be transgressive and counter cultural against the

183
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,840
The technology that's saying that you don't need to be in person and against the culture

184
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,760
That's saying that not being around people is better than being with people

185
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,560
Bravo. Okay, faith

186
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,160
family

187
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,160
Friendships contributing in terms of work

188
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,760
right

189
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,600
faith i'm a

190
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,560
non

191
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:16,840
Religious person non-believing person right many people listening will be if they don't have a direct

192
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,480
route to access faith

193
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,360
What are some of the highest return strategies they can do?

194
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,200
So remember the point isn't faith per se as transcendence

195
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,200
You need to do something that will make you small and the universe big

196
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,680
That's what that that's what the science really says

197
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:38,360
And you know in mother nature doesn't want you to do that mother nature is like it's all about you

198
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:44,200
You are the star of your psychodrama and why because you know that that's you know evolutionarily

199
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,600
It sort of makes sense that you'd be focusing on yourself all the time

200
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,000
But also it's worth pointing out that mother nature doesn't care if you're happy

201
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,800
mother nature

202
00:14:54,760 --> 00:15:01,640
Only cares that you survive and pass on your genes and so therefore happiness. That's that's your problem in your business

203
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:07,000
That's the key thing for us to keep in mind. I think that's just to interject there. I think that that

204
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:14,280
Realization that humans are not designed to achieve happiness that that's a state which might be

205
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,000
It's it's neither necessary nor sufficient for you to do what mother nature wanted you to do

206
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,640
It was just it was like a byproduct of it. So

207
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,920
Realizing, you know, it's not like you're swimming upstream

208
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,360
But that most of the set points and motivations

209
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,120
that

210
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,120
Your system will try and push you toward

211
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,320
Are not going to be conducive to happiness

212
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:40,520
So when the question of why why is it so hard to be happy or why is happiness a big dearth in the modern world?

213
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,480
It's like well, it's been in a big dearth for a very long time

214
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:48,120
There is no reason for your system to try and encourage you to be happy in the first place

215
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,520
Yeah, that's right and and and to speak in terms that you've often used in your show

216
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,420
That is to be managed by your limbic system

217
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:01,020
As opposed to actually drawing the experiences of your life into your prefrontal cortex

218
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:07,500
The c-suite of your brain where you're making decisions that the divine path actually comes from being fully human

219
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,860
The animal path comes from not being fully human

220
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:15,420
That that leaving these sensations in the emotional centers of the limbic system of your brain would say

221
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:20,300
Do this because you feel that that's no way to live. That's a really important thing to keep in in mind

222
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,180
Mother nature says you're the star of your psychodrama

223
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:28,060
You want to be happy? You have to leave that behind and the way to do that is to achieve transcendence from yourself

224
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:33,980
Here's a really good way to do that. You and I are one of your neighbor out there in austin texas is ryan holiday

225
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:40,460
Our mutual friend ryan hall of it. He's great. He's the world's leading expert on the modern understanding of the stoic philosophers

226
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:47,180
He reads senica for fun and epictetus and marcus aurelius and he's talking about wall cicero said

227
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:51,580
It's just amazing how he does that. Why because he actually wants to achieve transcendence

228
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:57,500
By doing the hard things that come from the denial of the visceral pleasures that are embedded in the

229
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:04,540
In the impulses of the limbic system. That's really what stoicism is all about. That's the divine path of transcendence using pure philosophy

230
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,580
Many philosophies will do that. I don't recommend niché

231
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:13,740
That's what a lot of sort of the modern crowd is is talking about which leads to some of the problems that we were just discussing a minute ago

232
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,980
There are better paths

233
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:21,580
Some people will actually get this by getting out of their head in a meditative experience using nature

234
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,540
So one of the things that I recommend to a lot of young people today

235
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:28,300
A lot of young guys coming out of college will call me. Ah, I feel lost

236
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,060
I thought I was going to be

237
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:34,300
So clear about my life when I got out of college and so what do I do professor?

238
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,820
And one of the things that I often recommend is i'm not going to you know

239
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:43,740
Tell them to go find some specific faith or sit in the mouth of the cave and talk to the guru or learn how to meditate immediately

240
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:47,020
What I say is get up an hour and a half before dawn

241
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:52,620
That's called the brahma muhurta in samskrita. That's that means in samskrita the creator's time

242
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:59,580
That is a very special time for for the development of your own brain because what you find is if you get up

243
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,980
systematically before sunrise

244
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,980
You're going to be more focused

245
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:07,980
You'll learn more quickly and your attention will be better throughout the course of the day

246
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:13,180
There's a lot of research that shows this get out of the house when it's nice and dark and cool

247
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,580
And walk for an hour be ambulatory for an hour

248
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:21,420
And and such that you're doing it as the sun is coming up by the end of your walk

249
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:26,540
And you can hear the crunch of the gravel on the trail beneath your feet. You don't have your device

250
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:31,180
You're not I mean I I strongly recommend listening to modern wisdom not then

251
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:36,380
That's not when you're listening to your podcast. You're listening to your heartbeat. You're listening to the birds

252
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:39,660
You're listening to the the sound of the trail in your feet, etc.

253
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,700
This is a very good way to do it. There's a lot of science to back it up

254
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,620
This is not just romanticism another way to do this is to

255
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,700
Is to actually

256
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:54,620
Stand in awe of great genius. I recommend learning about the fugues of yohan sebastian bach

257
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,260
And listening with utter seriousness

258
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:02,220
For example to his cantatas. He's got hundreds of them. They fell off his pen

259
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:06,780
Learn about that. It's just gonna it's gonna blow your mind. You'll be small. Trust me

260
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,620
You could start of a postant of meditation practice. Why not or

261
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,180
I go to mass every day

262
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:18,300
You can practice your faith and and by the way chris. I understand that you don't have a faith or you know a sense of this

263
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:24,780
You might after 40 and being open to the impulse to actually find the divine in your life

264
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:28,060
That's a critically important way to actually practice this as well. Just the openness

265
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,020
I went to my first american

266
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,180
Bible church

267
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,700
service on

268
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,740
Easter Sunday this year and

269
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:45,580
Boy was that that was an experience. There was a rock band. There was an led wall. There was pyrotechnics

270
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,220
I pulled up behind a

271
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,380
uh

272
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:56,700
Like super fast american muscle car that had god now as the number plate

273
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:00,620
So I found that it was very enjoyable and I can totally see why people do it

274
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:05,260
So I'm absolutely open to I'm open to the potential of that. All right. That's faith family

275
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,980
yeah, so

276
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:12,300
This should be pretty obvious not everybody by the way has access to

277
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:17,180
Functional family relationships. I get it and some people actually have to kind of assemble a family

278
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:21,420
But I'll tell you it's a kind of a funny thing. I mean, I didn't quite understand this until

279
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:26,620
Later in life and part of the reason is because I had at best kind of a cordial relationship with my parents

280
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,940
It was there's nothing wrong. They were there were good parents, but you know, I was doing my thing

281
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:37,020
I was living in europe through my 20s. I was I was a professional musician when you were, you know, throwing people out of bars

282
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,180
I was playing in a symphony orchestra

283
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:43,100
Which is a different lifestyle, but you know it bears certain similarities as well

284
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:47,500
You know you're out late at night and you're far away from home and you're living your dream and the whole thing

285
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,340
And I can't remember thinking

286
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:54,700
In my 20s, I should get to know my parents. My mother was an artist. My father was a mathematician

287
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,900
They were very interesting and intellectual and cultured people

288
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,860
And then they died

289
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,060
They just

290
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,660
died young

291
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:08,780
Now my father was pretty close to my age now and uh, and it was too late and I thought

292
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:15,020
You know, what does that mean? Does that set me back? And it turns out that I could fix that because now I have adult children

293
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,100
I'm a grandfather at this point

294
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:20,060
And I talk to all of my kids every single day

295
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,740
I see my grandson

296
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,260
I'm moving

297
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:26,460
Because my kids are moving and my grandchildren are going to living in a different place

298
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:29,340
And I'm not going to commute to them is what it comes down to

299
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:35,980
You must have family relationships or manufacture family relationships in your life and you must not have schism for

300
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,860
Stupidities like differences of political opinion

301
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:44,220
The narcissists and politics will tell you to stop talking to people in your family because they I don't know voted for

302
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,780
Trump or didn't vote for Trump or whatever the thing is

303
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:52,540
It's so idiotic that you would sacrifice your own happiness for somebody else's political cult

304
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,180
It's completely nutty is the way that that works out

305
00:21:55,420 --> 00:22:00,300
You need to have it keep it or make it and make it a part of your life that you exercise every day

306
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,860
all right friends

307
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:07,420
Friendship is should be the easiest because we're all surrounded by people all day long

308
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:12,780
And it turns out it's the hardest for a lot of people. I'm kind of a striver whisperer in my practice

309
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:17,180
I specialize in people that really want to make a lot with their lives that are serious about the

310
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:21,660
Entrepreneurial venture of their own life. They're the startup entrepreneur of me Inc.

311
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,660
I really admire that and it's something that I teach

312
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:27,900
The problem with that is it's very easy to no longer have real friends

313
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:34,700
They have deal friends, but not real friends and and real and deal are different deal deal friends. They're useful

314
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:39,420
They're very useful, right and it's good to have people who are useful to you and it's good to be useful to others

315
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,780
Don't get me wrong

316
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,660
But you need useless friends too people who just love you

317
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:47,020
You need useless friends. I don't mean worthless friends. I have those too

318
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:52,700
You need people who who are not useful to you and you're not useful to them

319
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:57,500
They just love you chris and and we have fewer and fewer of that. That's the reason that

320
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:01,820
60 percent of 60 year old men today say their best friend is their wives

321
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:05,180
And 30 percent of their wives say their best friend is their husband

322
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:12,300
That's a a sad story of unrequited love for men my age. It's really important to keep this in mind

323
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:16,220
It's also because women seem to be able to hold on to

324
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,780
uh, that allo parenting

325
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:24,700
Adjacents group of close friends better than men do. I mean, this is one of the reasons why during

326
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:28,300
divorces men have a worse time of it

327
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:33,820
For many reasons, but one of them being that they often subjugate their friend group for their wife's friend group

328
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,260
And when the wife goes away the friend group goes away

329
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:45,580
Yeah, yeah, so for in traditionally organized families in in past times in particular when dad left and and made a living

330
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:49,740
Outside the home at work. He would be cheating his family by hanging out with his friends

331
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:56,780
And so he didn't and the result is that he lost his friendship chops over the years and got lonelier and lonelier and lonelier

332
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,180
Now you think it'd be much better now

333
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:03,260
It's much worse because everybody's doing that now everybody's men are doing that women are doing that

334
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:08,140
And you find that women and men under 30 are now the loneliest cohort in our society

335
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:12,940
And the more successful they are in their lives the lonelier they tend to be in their lives

336
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,660
They're more likely to say that nobody knows me well

337
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:18,860
The reason is real and deal and you got to do the work

338
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:23,180
I mean for a lot of people they haven't had close friendships since college or from high school

339
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:29,580
And when they're you know, 28 years old and now 35 years old they're 45 years old and everybody's incredibly useful to them

340
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:36,140
Now to be sure the the most successful marriages are the ones that are based on on on deep friendship

341
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:40,220
We call it companion at love which sounds, you know, distinctly not hot

342
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:45,500
I get it, but it's important because that's the the closest friendship you're going to have but it's not enough

343
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,500
You find that the happiest people they have they're very close friends with their spouse

344
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:55,740
But they have one really close friend at least besides that introverts usually have one really close friend besides a spouse

345
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,060
Extroverts have more like five

346
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:01,740
They don't have 20 because you don't have the time to maintain that but it's really important

347
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:07,100
How often do we need to see our friends? How do we determine whether somebody is real or deal?

348
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:11,260
What's the amount of time that we need to spend with them per week, etc, etc

349
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:16,140
Yeah, there's lots of rules for that and again, this falls into the your results may vary category

350
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:19,580
But there's one thing that I do know when somebody says, oh, yeah, no, no, I mean that's like

351
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,900
I have some real friends. Let's say think about your most real friend who's not your spouse again

352
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:26,220
When's the last time you talked to him?

353
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:29,580
I don't know two months ago. Not a real friend. I'm sorry

354
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:33,820
I'm sorry. I mean, it's like if it's your real friend you keep up to date with your real friends

355
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:39,340
I have two guys that I talk to every week and they one lives in san francisco and one lives in atlanta

356
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,940
I live in boston

357
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,460
I see them in person. I saw one of them for breakfast yesterday in new york city

358
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,820
We take opportunities with one of them. We go on vacation together with our wives

359
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:52,620
That's the effort that you make because you you want to see the people you love

360
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,980
You want to see him in person you make the effort you want to talk to him

361
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:59,660
You miss him you actually miss him if if you don't miss the person

362
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:03,420
It doesn't kind of hurt your heart because you haven't talked to him in a while in a week

363
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:08,380
It's not a real friend. What's the difference between real and deal? How can someone tell a lot of the time we

364
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:14,940
Feel like real friends are also impressive if you're on the personal growth journey. It's difficult to

365
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:21,820
Distinguish real and deal from real ordeal. Yeah, the difference is that with a deal friend

366
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:28,380
There's something in front. There's this trend. There's a transaction that's happening. That's more important than the emotion transaction

367
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:33,180
Trump's emotion. There's nothing wrong with that with people in your life. By the way, it's not like you should

368
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:38,460
Fire all of your transactional friendships. No because you'll wind up without a career to be sure

369
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,620
It's very good to help each other

370
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:45,100
But if the emotion that you feel for the person is more important than the transaction you could undertake

371
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:49,740
Okay, that's good in which case you can actually have deals with your real friends

372
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:56,620
But that's the key component and if for all of them, it's like I care a lot more about how the person is useful to me

373
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,180
Than the person's life. That's when you know

374
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,740
Got you final one. What?

375
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,940
Yeah

376
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:05,660
Work is you know, people listening to us right now

377
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:10,300
They want an edge in their lives and I and I understand that in a way that they

378
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:17,100
Measure that edge frequently is is in their and their success. You know, I think I probably at first listened to you

379
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:22,460
Three years ago, maybe the first time I heard your show and I think you just passed

380
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,340
I don't know a hundred thousand

381
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:30,140
YouTube subscribers or something that was a long time ago because you have a lot more than that right now

382
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:35,340
And I remember you're like, I can't believe it man and your career was kind of blowing up

383
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:40,060
I remember thinking that because I was thinking yeah, this young guy is doing great. It's very inspirational

384
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:44,220
I love people who are in the hunt. I really really love people who are in the hunt

385
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,300
The problem is

386
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,580
That when it comes to work the hunt itself doesn't give you

387
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:53,980
Doesn't give you the satisfaction that you're going to desire mother nature lies to you in many ways

388
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:57,980
But and we've talked about it before but but here's one of the biggest lies that mother nature gives you

389
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,380
If you're successful and making

390
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:06,780
Progress and money and power and the admiration of other people then you'll be happy you get happiness for free

391
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,980
Success first happiness second. So you don't have to worry about happiness

392
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,980
You just have to be successful money power

393
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:12,700
admiration

394
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,700
Maybe a little pleasure thrown in there along the way

395
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,300
Those are the worldly idols by the way st. Thomas Aquinas

396
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:23,340
In paraphrasing Aristotle and the Summa Theologia written in 1265

397
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:27,820
Classified those as the world's idols he was an excellent social scientist

398
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:32,140
Because it turns out that those are the intermediate good. There's nothing wrong with those things by the way

399
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:37,340
I'm not condemning those things. They're just incomplete for your happiness if you you have those as the goals

400
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:41,740
You're in real trouble. Okay. So what are the right goals from work? It's twofold

401
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,800
number one earn your success

402
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:51,500
That means create value with your life and work in your life in the lives of other people and you have to be rewarded and

403
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:55,340
Acknowledged and recognized for the the real value that you're creating

404
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:03,020
10 years nonsense loyalties nonsense merit hard work and personal responsibility and you're rewarded and recognized for it

405
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,020
And you believe it that's earned success

406
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:09,340
That by the way, that's why I'm a complete advocate for the free enterprise system

407
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,020
Not because I you know, it's like rah rah rah capitalism adam smith

408
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:13,740
No

409
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:19,340
Because it makes people happy when they're succeeding in the in the in a system that rewards merit and personal responsibility

410
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:23,100
It's not perfect, but it's the only system we got that really does that that's number one two

411
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,580
Now i'm going to sound like a commie

412
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,340
service to others

413
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:32,700
Service to others you need to actually believe actually that's not communism. That's capitalism too. I take it back

414
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:37,740
Service to others is incredibly it's it's this will bring you joy to your work

415
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:41,340
You have to know that people need you the essence of human dignity

416
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,580
Is about being needed

417
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:50,860
Is like feeling it like an asset in society the essence of despair is feeling like a liability to be managed

418
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:55,340
By your family by the welfare system by anybody else

419
00:29:55,420 --> 00:30:00,540
Which is why it's so terrible to be in poverty because of the way that we treat people in poverty

420
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:05,740
We don't look at them as assets to develop which they should be because human beings are human beings with equal dignity

421
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,580
We treat them like, you know

422
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:14,860
Liabilities to manage by the by whatever system that they're they're talking about to create value in the lives of other people to

423
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:21,020
To to to serve others means that they need you and that is the true secret to everything else

424
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,180
Now you get it like crazy because you know

425
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,940
You don't you don't have gunned anybody's head to listen to modern wisdom

426
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:33,580
They're coming to you voluntarily and that is this affirmation. They need me. They like it. It's in the comments. Thank you

427
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,180
My guess is you get

428
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:40,060
20 emails a day from people who say that that podcast really changed my thinking

429
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:45,820
They need you. Well, everybody needs that every single person needs that whether you're you know picking apples or

430
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:49,980
You know trying to you know running for congress you actually need that in your life

431
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:53,820
Those are the two service to others and and earning your success

432
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,700
I had an essay that I wrote

433
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,460
Probably about a year ago now

434
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:01,740
I want to read it to you about the tension between success and happiness

435
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,540
One of the most tensions one of the most common tensions

436
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:08,780
I talk about at the moment is between a desire for success and a desire to feel like we're enough

437
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,860
Success is a strange thing

438
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:16,140
Presumably we want success because we think a more successful life will bring us more happiness meaning and fulfillment

439
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,940
Here's the problem. We sacrifice the thing we want

440
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:24,140
Happiness for the thing which is supposed to get it success failure can make you miserable

441
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,660
But i'm not sure that success will make you happy one of the most common dynamics

442
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:30,780
I see amongst high performances is this parents want their child to do well

443
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:35,260
Parents encourage their child to do well by praising when they succeed and criticizing when they fail

444
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:39,980
The child learns that praise and admiration is contingent on succeeding this lesson

445
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:46,060
Metastasizes through early adulthood into I am only worthy of love acceptance and belonging if I succeed

446
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,860
Now powered by an internal feeling of insufficiency

447
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,260
This person is driven to achieve many things

448
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:56,620
They're prepared to outwork out hustle and out suffer everyone else because they're not just running toward a life that they want

449
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:01,900
They're running away from a life that they fear success and progress ameliorates the feelings of insufficiency

450
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:05,740
Therefore success and progress becomes prioritized above everything else

451
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:10,940
Now don't get me wrong many high performers genuinely love the work that they do and many are driven by a well balanced

452
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,420
simple desire to maximize their time on this planet

453
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,540
Rather than trying to fill a void inside of themselves

454
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:21,660
But if I was to place a bet I'd guess that the majority of high performers are driven by fears of insufficiency

455
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,220
Rather than a holistic desire to be better

456
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:28,460
I think people who are high achievers on average are more miserable than the average person

457
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:33,420
So what does it mean that the people we admire most are the ones with the least admirable internal states?

458
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:38,140
If the pursuit of success is in an effort to make us happy and in the pursuit of success

459
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:43,340
We make ourselves miserable. Why not just shortcut the entire process and just be happy?

460
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:46,620
Is that even possible now external accolades count for a lot?

461
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:51,820
And I don't think that recanting all worldly possessions and retreating to a cave in the woods is an optimal strategy

462
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:58,140
Some degree of external material success is important to make us feel validated and satiate our desire for status and respect

463
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:05,340
But external success will not fill an internal void and insufficiency adaptation is this if your drive

464
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:10,940
Comes from a fear of insufficiency and you continue to disprove those fears with success in the real world

465
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:17,340
And yet the feeling of insufficiency persists. What makes you think that the answer to this problem is more success

466
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,900
nice

467
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,780
Very astute you're a natural social scientist

468
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,820
I admire it and it's all true

469
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:29,500
Look everything is like there's a ton of science that backs all that up, but you don't need it

470
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:34,460
Everybody knows that that look if you go for the success to get the happiness

471
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:38,940
You're going to get the success because we'll be unto you if you have the wrong dreams

472
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:44,380
Your dreams are going to come true if you work hard on them, but you're not going to get to the happiness the right strategy

473
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:48,860
Is to shoot for greater happiness and then you'll have enough success

474
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:52,620
Now those words for a guy like you a stranger like you

475
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,180
They give you a little chill don't they?

476
00:33:55,660 --> 00:34:01,500
Because enough success doesn't sound right. No, no, man. I'm not doing this for enough success

477
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,780
I know tons of guys back in high school who have enough success

478
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,500
I don't want that. I want to be

479
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,620
I want to be special chris. I want to be special

480
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:19,660
How many people with a success addiction, which is the fundamental brain delivered underlying dopamine?

481
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:26,140
Moderated or mediated addiction which lies behind workaholism by the way

482
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:30,620
How many of those people have chosen specialness over happiness?

483
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:35,980
That's what you're talking about any loser can cultivate all these relationships and all these friendships

484
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:40,380
But not every loser can work as hard as I do and become a navy seal

485
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:46,380
and do you know 50 pull-ups and and have you know 40 million

486
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,260
Instagram followers. I don't know

487
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:53,820
If that's specialness and and by the way mother nature is arriving you once again

488
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:57,980
Mother nature does not care if you're happy, but mother nature wants you to be special

489
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:03,260
So that you'll be able to survive more easily by having a higher rank in the kin group

490
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:06,860
And being able to pass on your genes because you'll be the alpha

491
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:10,940
But that's not what you want. That's actually not even what you want

492
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:14,140
You're gonna get enough food and you don't want 750 kids

493
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:22,140
You what you want is a really really good life and you're being driven by these ancient impulses

494
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:27,660
That's exactly what you're saying and you've walked into a dopaminergic

495
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:33,020
Moderated and I don't know why I actually had this thing come up on my screen right now. It's fine. It's fine

496
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:42,220
It's a why we we we walk into a a a success addiction that makes your brain look more or less like a methamphetamine addicts brain

497
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,020
How can people

498
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:49,340
Learn to unwind and detach themselves from their desire for success

499
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:55,740
You don't need to unwind your desire for success. You need to understand and manage your desire

500
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:59,740
That's what we need to do on all these things. You don't need to want different things

501
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:04,380
You need to manage your wants for these different things. Look, what does that? I don't drink?

502
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,940
I don't drink alcohol. I don't drink alcohol

503
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:12,300
And the reason I don't drink alcohol is because there's a lot of alcoholism in my family and I drank way too much when I was your age

504
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,700
I drank a lot when I was your age

505
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,620
And so

506
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,620
I stopped

507
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:22,700
And I stopped a long time ago. I stopped over 20 years ago. I still want alcohol

508
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:29,420
I'm not going to stop wanting alcohol. What I do is I manage my desire for alcohol through visa v my behavior

509
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:34,940
That's what we need to do. Look, of course, you're ambitious. Of course, you're driven for tremendous success

510
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:35,820
That's wonderful

511
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:43,340
But it can't manage you that that that drive that ambition that that that intense visceral sense that that you'll only

512
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:47,580
Be special if you have enough success you can't let it manage you is what it comes down to

513
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:51,100
Of course, you have these desires. By the way, chris, you're going to get married at some point

514
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:55,740
And and after you're married you're going to look at a woman and she's going to be incredibly beautiful

515
00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:00,380
And you're going to have a sense of natural human desire for her and you're not going to act on it

516
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:05,740
That's the same thing is true when when you could work the 14th hour instead of spending the first hour with your kids

517
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:09,740
You're going to make the decision to sublimate that desire and manage it

518
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:13,820
Yeah, that's interesting. I remember david bus told me this story

519
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,780
That a reader sent in to him

520
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:20,860
Saying that his book had saved his marriage

521
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:26,060
Because this guy had been married for a while maybe between five and ten years something like that

522
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:30,060
and he'd found himself being attracted to other women and

523
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:39,500
He took that attraction as some sort of sense that his existing relationship was wrong if I was

524
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,820
Fully totally renaissance period besotted with my partner

525
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,940
I wouldn't have eyes for any other woman for the rest of time

526
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:53,740
And david explained that there is a very very well embedded reward system that men get when they look at

527
00:37:54,060 --> 00:38:01,660
Even a pair of rocks that slightly resemble boobs like you are driven to just like sexualize and look at anything

528
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,260
whether it's like

529
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:05,260
geological or otherwise and

530
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:10,460
He said that it sort of liberated me from this sense that I can't

531
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:16,540
The desire itself is wrong and I must tell myself a story about it. It feels a little bit to me

532
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,340
like this

533
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:22,940
Line that we have drawn between when I get enough success

534
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:27,740
I will allow myself to be happy or I will I will have justified happiness happiness will come as a byproduct

535
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,140
Along for the ride with success

536
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:36,780
That's kind of the same look your desire to continue to chase this thing may not really

537
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,940
Cease all that much

538
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:42,780
But your choice about whether or not you do work the 14th hour today

539
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:47,340
Is one of those and it's not just about you know, it's kind of further upstream

540
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:50,780
I'm going to guess what you need to do is go further upstream than this and think about

541
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,620
How many hours a day do I want to work?

542
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:56,460
How much work do I need to put on my plate in order for me to need to work those number of hours

543
00:38:56,620 --> 00:39:00,780
Because otherwise what you're going to end up doing is failing at things that you've intended to do

544
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:06,060
Like if you've put 14 hours of work on your plate, like you kind of need to do it until you no longer need to do it

545
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,860
And that is a more sort of life design

546
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,260
position

547
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,740
That's right. The unfortunate fact is that

548
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:20,540
You won't know how to do anything else once you become hopelessly addicted because these behavioral patterns feed on themselves

549
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:23,580
Notwithstanding the fact that you're getting unhappier and unhappier

550
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:27,820
Furthermore, there's one other thing that's keep that's worth pointing out if you were

551
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:31,180
An you know an untreated alcoholic

552
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:37,500
Nobody would say like dude last night you put away two bottles of vodka. That was impressive

553
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:43,500
I admire you for that. They'd be like get some help man. That was it's pathetic

554
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:47,820
But if you work 14 hour days, they're going to be like man, you're going to be the next Elon Musk

555
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,380
What do you admire about Elon Musk?

556
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,900
He works all the time

557
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:57,740
He and you know people will admire the fact that he says I haven't taken a day off since 2008 or something like that

558
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:04,140
We love workaholics in our culture. We love success addicts. We love people who are

559
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:09,580
Self-objectifiers, but let's just think about that a little bit. I mean, I bet when you were a kid

560
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,580
Did you have a good relationship with your dad?

561
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,260
Yeah, not bad

562
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:16,220
And I bet that he said that you shouldn't objectify women

563
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:22,380
You shouldn't look at them and say that they're nothing more than sex objects or that you should treat them like real people, right?

564
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,980
you know

565
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:29,980
Why because you you're a boy and you have an impulse to not do that for all the reasons that david buss has made very clear on your show

566
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:36,940
Okay, well, you shouldn't objectify yourself either chris and and a self-objectifier is somebody who looks in the mirror and says

567
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,420
That's a success machine

568
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,740
That's somebody and you know that these

569
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:48,140
Affirmations it'd be like looking in the mirror and saying that's somebody who can say stay stoned all day

570
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,020
It wouldn't do that. That'd be pathetic. It could be weird

571
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:55,420
And yet that's kind of the thing that we do with the self-objectification which is downstream from success addiction

572
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,500
Which actually is related to workaholism

573
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:03,180
Which all these weird patterns of behavior that we establish often before even before adolescence

574
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:08,300
All right, let's get into the macro nutrients the component parts of happiness

575
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:15,100
We've got three to go through one other. Yeah enjoyment satisfaction and meaning and they seem self-evident, but they're not

576
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:19,660
The that to be I'll give you an example enjoyment sounds like pleasure

577
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:22,780
But it's completely different for all the reasons that we've kind of discussed

578
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,340
pleasure is a limbic phenomenon

579
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:27,580
pleasure is uh is uh

580
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:35,180
And it's a set of signals in your limbic system saying that something is either really good for helping you survive to get calories

581
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:38,220
Are really good for getting mates and passing on your genes

582
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:42,700
That's really the and and we become ingenious at in the laboratory

583
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:49,100
Creating new ways to get those sensations. So, you know, everything from gambling to pornography to

584
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,740
methamphetamine to

585
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:58,860
Fentanyl to alcohol all these things do is they mimic different ways that in the place to seem before we had substances in these behaviors

586
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:02,540
That we would get pleasure from something that actually helps us survive and pass on our genes

587
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:07,820
Unfortunately, all those things that I just mentioned are addictive and bad for you because

588
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:11,580
You know, what you're doing is you're artificially stimulating something you don't need to do

589
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:16,300
And in a way that your your body and brain are not accustomed to and so they're incredibly unhealthy

590
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:19,580
A lot of guys, especially your age, don't realize how dangerous

591
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:24,940
Is for the brain for example, but what it is is just it fires up that impulse to pass on your genes

592
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:31,820
In an artificial way. Okay. So why do I bring that up? Because all those limbic searches for pleasure are different than enjoyment

593
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:35,340
Which is fundamentally an experience in the prefrontal cortex of your brain

594
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:40,140
And you don't have to not have pleasure by the way. I'm not I'm I'm catholic. I'm not I'm not a puritan

595
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:45,500
And what you need is the source of pleasure plus people plus memory

596
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:51,500
Thus delivering the experience into your prefrontal cortex, which is part of happiness. So I'll give you an example

597
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:56,460
I was doing work with a big beer company and we were talking about these ideas and I said look

598
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:00,140
Associate your product with enjoyment not pleasure

599
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:06,460
And I said, what do you mean? Well, don't run a commercial of a dude alone in his apartment pounding a 12 pack

600
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:13,420
Why because that's the pursuit of pleasure and everybody knows is addictive and dangerous and irresponsible and pathetic

601
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:17,900
Do the ad where the guy is having a beer with his brother or his friends

602
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:23,260
You've taken beer plus people plus memory and that equals enjoyment and that's part of happiness

603
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:29,420
If you're doing something as pleasurable and and it can be addictive and you're doing it alone. You're probably doing it wrong

604
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:33,980
That's where pornography comes in. That's where gambling by yourself comes in

605
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,940
That's where eating a whole cake by yourself comes in

606
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:41,420
That's where using what drinking alone comes in all of these particular behaviors

607
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:48,620
And that's an example of how the the neuroscience of this can be intensely practical in helping you to lead a better life and change your habits

608
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:52,700
What else is there to say about the

609
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,660
way to use

610
00:43:55,660 --> 00:44:03,180
Pleasure people and memories is there something you should do to embed memories more effectively other types of pleasures that seem to be better for

611
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:07,100
Happiness or not other types of people. Is there a way that you can reinforce this?

612
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:11,900
Do I need an ebbing house forgetting curve flash card anky deck to be able to remember all of the shit that I did?

613
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:15,100
I mean, hey man, let's make it. Let's make some money. So

614
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:23,420
I mean, see you're such a natural entrepreneur. It's it's unbelievable. You go write your product. It's great. Um, yeah, the people shouldn't be addicts

615
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:29,980
You know, it's not going to be helpful to you if your community of people who help you enjoy things that are pleasurable are also drunks

616
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:36,540
So so it's obviously the case that you want people who are trying to enjoy each other's company as opposed to simply focusing on the

617
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:41,100
The source of the pleasure the the chemical or behavioral source of the pleasure. That's really important

618
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:47,580
Actually just to interject that I wonder whether I wonder whether there's an analogy to be drawn between

619
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:53,100
Um, let's say that you know a bunch of people in a crack den all of whom are just smoking crack

620
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:57,340
And the only reason that they're there is to like be around other people that also do crack

621
00:44:57,340 --> 00:45:00,380
That's just the environment that they they exist in. I wonder whether

622
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:04,780
There is kind of an equivalent if you were to let's say be

623
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:12,140
A professional athlete of some kind training in a facility with a bunch of other individual athletes

624
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:17,980
But all of whom were only there because they also needed to use the facility individually that they were there for the

625
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:21,020
personal pursuit now, obviously the pursuit of

626
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:25,100
training versus the sort of direct pleasure that you get from taking drugs

627
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:27,340
but my point being that

628
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:28,460
there's

629
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:29,900
a lack of

630
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:35,900
Interaction between each of those individuals. They're very much siloed within their own experience of whatever the pleasure might be

631
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,700
You are at a gaming a games

632
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:42,700
Place where tons of people can play call of duty

633
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:46,140
But none of you are playing against each other and none of you are speaking to each other

634
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:49,660
Right like you're with people. It's doing it in community

635
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,740
But it's not

636
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:56,060
Integrating with the people. Yeah interaction is critically important. You're not with other people

637
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:59,100
You're not actually with other people if you're just

638
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:01,740
In a crowd. I mean you can feel unbelievably

639
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:07,100
Lonely walking down the street in New York City. You're technically all walking down the street in New York City

640
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:09,660
This is with little kids. You'll see this when you have children

641
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:14,220
Before they learn how to interact with each other they do they do something called parallel play

642
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:19,020
Where you'll bring two little kids two little two year olds together and they'll be playing with blocks

643
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:23,020
But not together parallel like they want to be looking at each other's way that that works

644
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:25,340
That doesn't stimulate oxytocin

645
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:29,500
And so if you want to get into the neurochemistry of what we're talking about here

646
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:36,700
You're not going to get the benefit of pleasure plus people plus memory unless you're doing something that really stimulates oxytocin

647
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:40,540
Which means intense interaction eye contact and ideally human touch as well

648
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:43,100
Right. Okay. So this is an argument to

649
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:44,940
You know

650
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:48,860
Give your friends a hug when they just win at a board game to like reach up a high five

651
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:54,140
I play a lot of werewolves. Have you played werewolves? No, I haven't okay. So werewolves is like a

652
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:59,340
It's a role-playing card game where everybody in a circle is given a particular character

653
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:04,460
Some are good guys some are bad guys and you don't know who's who and you have to bluff your way through

654
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:10,300
The game and oh, I thought about that. Yeah. Yeah, there's another game called mafia, which is basically the same but with different characters

655
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:12,860
and I have observed

656
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:15,340
People that have been married for 15 years

657
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:21,100
Where they completely straight face just lie to their partner about what their role is. No, of course not, honey

658
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:26,860
I love you. I would like so we've had to make a rule that like what happens during werewolves stays during werewolves

659
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:32,060
Because the potential blast radius of sort of the loss of the loss of certainty

660
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:36,620
Lots of trust. Yeah, exactly. There's a lot of uh, I play with a lot of like

661
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:41,660
World-class pro poker players too, which is just like a kind of to be honest an unfair fight

662
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:44,140
My point being that with that as soon as the game's finished

663
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:46,460
Everybody gets up everybody's sort of high five

664
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:48,220
There's been a ton of tension for a long time

665
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:50,540
Some people have been working together some people have been working against them

666
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:54,940
But they've been working together too and everybody's sort of high-fiving and all the rest of it and it's very enjoyable

667
00:47:55,260 --> 00:48:00,060
Um, what is there to say just to round this out? What is there to say about memories?

668
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:06,060
Um, what can we do to maximize the yield of memories when it comes to enjoyment?

669
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:10,540
The key thing is actually to do something that's not part of your ordinary routine

670
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:13,020
The more that you'll actually

671
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:18,860
Disequilibrate your experience around for example a particular occasion or in a particular place

672
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:24,220
That will add to the memory such that it will be easier to recall to put together and to recall

673
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:28,780
And you'll be able to do it to to to to recreate that enjoyment again and again and again

674
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:35,340
What you'll want is to do something where the experience doesn't stop at the end of the action

675
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:39,340
That's what you really want. What do you mean when you say disequilibriate?

676
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:43,580
Disequilibrate what your ordinary routine is so so you'll notice that

677
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:48,140
The things that you do every single day you don't remember them the things you don't do every single day

678
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:54,380
You remember them and that's how you the recall so you can have the duration of the experience be richer and longer

679
00:48:54,620 --> 00:49:00,220
To do is to you know when you're going to hang out with your friends go someplace with your friends right as opposed to

680
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:02,140
Is this a degree of novelty?

681
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:06,540
Yeah, and that's one of the reasons that I recommend that couples for example leave the house

682
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:13,260
That they do things together outside of the house. So they're not you know, they don't get into too much of a domestic routine, which is a very

683
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:21,500
Un a sort of uninteresting way to run your marriage is to do the same thing over and over and over and over again

684
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,300
You're just not going to get the benefits of enjoyment in the same way

685
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:30,940
I had uh, Susanna Hallinan on the show forever ever ever ago. Now remember she had this really great book

686
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:34,780
Uh talking about how to make time move more slowly

687
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:37,820
Yeah, it was so fascinating and it seems to me

688
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:43,580
At least my current sort of conception of it, which may need to be updated now is novelty and intensity

689
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:49,100
Those seem to be two of the things that increase the frequency of memory blocks sort of being dropped in that you know

690
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:56,300
Someone that's listening has driven to work a thousand times. That's a thousand journeys, but it was always the same route

691
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:58,620
so you have condensed a thousand

692
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:04,620
15 minute half hour blocks down into essentially one memory apart from that one time that there was a car crash

693
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:08,220
next to me and it was different because novelty and intensity and um,

694
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:10,460
yeah, I think just trying to

695
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:12,220
Keep that in mind to you know

696
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:18,380
Turn left instead of turning right when you go to the shops to go to a different restaurant to travel to a different hotel to do the whatever

697
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:20,700
Um, I think important

698
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:25,100
It is important and and there's a lot of ways that you can do that my wife and I have tried to do that

699
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:27,100
We've moved 20 times

700
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:32,860
In the 35 years that we've been together, uh, I mean we I mean it sounds like we're in the witness protection program

701
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:37,180
I realized but it's part of it is just because when we decide that we want to do a new thing

702
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:42,140
We do a new thing we've moved three times in the past five years because you know, where do we want to live not here?

703
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:43,820
I try that

704
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:48,540
And and this this it's not a search for novel it can become a pathology to be sure

705
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:50,700
You know, you actually can't stop any place

706
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:53,580
But the whole idea that you can live in a new way

707
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:57,500
Try a new thing and not letting it turn into kind of a groove

708
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:04,460
One of the reasons that the perception of time speeding up happens as people get older is because their openness to experience starts to decline

709
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:08,940
particularly after 55 your openness to experience increases

710
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:14,300
Um through your teenage years into your early 20s and it stays relatively constant until your mid 50s

711
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:17,180
And then it really takes a big dip as a as a matter of this

712
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:23,660
The way that we typically measured it and what we see your love of new things starts to decline you you got to fight against that

713
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:25,820
If you want if you don't want time to go

714
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:30,940
Terrifyingly fast and and and suddenly life is over one of the best ways to do it as you

715
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:34,060
Correctly point out is to inject more more

716
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:38,140
You know newness of the ways that you do things in your life and to do that with your partner as well

717
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:40,780
All right satisfaction. Yeah

718
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:46,620
Satisfaction is a weird one. So satisfaction is you know, we talk about it all the time, you know

719
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:51,180
But we don't really define it satisfaction is the joy that you get after struggle

720
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:56,700
And this is the weird human mystery only humans want pain

721
00:51:57,260 --> 00:52:01,900
We only humans want to sacrifice and struggle because then the rewards are sweeter

722
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:05,900
The more you struggle before the more and and everybody kind of knows that's true

723
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:10,780
And yet we don't follow through on that very often. We're always looking for the easy way out

724
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:12,860
That's the reason that there's this kind of this

725
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:16,220
Call of the wild that people have when they listen to people like david goggins

726
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:22,940
Or jack-o-willingke because they're whole or rich role, you know, these are all mutual friends of ours, obviously

727
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:28,860
And it's like the the the thing that's kind of calling from nature to people when they hear this and they find it so attractive

728
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:31,260
It's like, yeah, yeah, man. I need more pain

729
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:37,340
I need more pain in my life because then my life will be sweeter and yet they're going through life trying to find the

730
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:39,340
Easiest way out. This is a real mystery

731
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:43,500
Actually, it's not, you know the divine path requires struggle

732
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:49,420
And the animal path wants convenience and ease and a complete lack of pain

733
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,500
It wants sort of an analgesic existence

734
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:57,340
So one of the things that we do is we try to teach our kids this, you know, when your kids are little you say

735
00:52:58,380 --> 00:52:59,900
Don't eat before dinner

736
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:05,580
All parents say this and the and the kid is always like why and you make up a bogus

737
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:11,180
Excuse like it's bad for you. You know, you're not going to get your proper nutrients. It's all nonsense

738
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:16,780
You don't want your kid to eat before dinner because you want your kid to be suffering a little bit of hunger before dinner

739
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:20,220
So they'll enjoy their dinner and be happier. That's what you actually want

740
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:23,420
But you can't quite articulate it and you don't want to tell the kid

741
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:26,460
It's because I want you to suffer you want the kid to suffer

742
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:30,460
And so that's an important thing to keep in mind and that's a real conundrum

743
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:34,060
And the the more that we can understand that the more that we can expose ourselves to

744
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:36,540
Suffering for the right reasons

745
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:42,220
You really should get up before you're ready and while it's still dark. It's best for you to do that

746
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:45,580
You should work out in the morning. It's a good thing to do

747
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:47,660
I mean, I get it not everybody can do that

748
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:52,460
You should do these things that actually hurt and your day will be better and your life will be happier

749
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:57,740
That's the first mystery is you know trying to sort that the second mystery however is bigger

750
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:03,580
In satisfaction, which is that mother nature tells us that if we get that thing like that millions

751
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:10,700
YouTube subscriber, you're gonna love that forever. How long did you enjoy that like half an hour five minutes?

752
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:13,980
Yeah, that's pretty good. All right five minutes, right?

753
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:18,140
And but but your brain told you the whole way that when you got that it was going to be awesome

754
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:22,060
You know, so so Mick Jagger saying I can't get no satisfaction. That's wrong

755
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:25,900
You wouldn't try and try and try and try if you couldn't get no satisfaction

756
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:28,220
You can't keep no satisfaction

757
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:31,740
That's the real problem and you try and you try and you try and that's what

758
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:34,860
The reason for that is what neuroscientists call homeostasis

759
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:41,420
Which of course you know about and homeostasis is the tendency of any physiological system to go back to its baseline

760
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:47,180
So you're ready for the next set of circumstances. It's true for your emotions. It's awesome. It's awesome

761
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:51,820
Forget it. I got to go back so that I'm not distracted from then so I can stay in the hunt

762
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:55,180
Is what it comes down to otherwise I'd start to death after I got food

763
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:58,620
You know be like I was good enough and then you die and you don't want that

764
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:05,260
So that's the key thing and we the mystery is that really smart sophisticated people never figure that out

765
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:09,900
And they conclude that they just didn't have enough and this gets back to your success problem

766
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:16,220
This gets back to the success conundrum. It's like, yeah, I got that thing, but I'm still not satisfied

767
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:20,620
So I guess I needed five million. I guess I needed 50 million

768
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:25,020
The first thing that a billionaire concludes is that he needed another billion

769
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:30,460
Have you seen have you seen that study where when pretty much anybody is asked

770
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:33,660
What level of wealth would you be satisfied with?

771
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:37,260
It doesn't matter what level of wealth you're at. It tends to be almost

772
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:42,780
Exactly three times your current income. It's like at about three times where I'm at now

773
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:47,260
That's that's my sort of settling point, but it scales all the way up to a billion

774
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:51,660
Yeah, yeah, there are different studies that one of the studies. I mean some studies say is 40 percent

775
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:54,540
Some studies say is 300 percent the bottom line is more

776
00:55:55,260 --> 00:56:00,780
Because that's what your brain is telling you that the secret to satisfaction that endures is more

777
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:07,260
More what more money more power more pleasure more honor more instagram followers more sexual partners more more

778
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:11,820
And and the problem with that is that it doesn't recognize that there's

779
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:19,020
A divine version of that that actually works. There's a what I did it again. I keep getting these weird effects on my camera

780
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:22,060
That there is a way to hack this

781
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:26,860
This this neuro physiological matrix this evolutionary matrix

782
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:31,580
And the way to think about this so that you're not subject to this you can be free forever, by the way

783
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:37,740
Is by remembering the satisfaction that endures is actually a function of all the things you have

784
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:40,300
Divided by the things that you want

785
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:43,340
haves divided by wants is the right

786
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:48,380
Mental model for you to pursue and that means of course you have a have more strategy

787
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:51,420
Of course you do you also need a want less strategy

788
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:55,100
You need to manage your wants just as much as you need to manage your haves

789
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:58,620
I realize that's very Buddhist, but it's actually in every spiritual and philosophical tradition

790
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:03,820
And so the way that I do that the couple of ways to do that one one way to think about that is to think about the metaphor

791
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:10,060
The metaphor of success for entrepreneurs is kind of like you're an artist and and you're putting

792
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:13,180
Brushstrokes on a canvas of your life

793
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:18,460
The right metaphor is is at some point in your life at least is actually the sculptor

794
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:26,380
Where you're chipping away the jade or the marble to find the true work of art within and that means getting rid of the detritus

795
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:30,380
The part of the block of marble that's not the horse or the rider

796
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:35,500
So that you can find the horse and rider inside and one way to do that that I often do

797
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:41,340
Is like I used to have a bucket list everybody who listens to this podcast those little bucket lists

798
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:43,420
I have a reverse bucket list now

799
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:49,020
Where I take my worldly cravings and desires and ambitions, which I still have I'm turning 60 in two weeks

800
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:51,340
And I still have the these dumb

801
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:56,380
You know at this craven trivial desires. I'm a weak weak man

802
00:57:57,020 --> 00:58:01,020
But I'm I actually will write them down on my birthday and I will cross them out

803
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:02,860
Not because I'm not going to get them

804
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:09,580
But because I want the management of those cravings and desires to be in my prefrontal cortex and not in my limbic system

805
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:17,020
Can you give us some examples of of what you cross out? Yeah, so one of the things will be for example these worldly

806
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:21,100
Metrics of success in my particular industry that are trivial

807
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:25,420
So for you, it would be a certain number of of youtube subscribers for me

808
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:28,060
It would be a certain number of

809
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:30,780
sales of my latest book or

810
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:34,460
Or prestige inside the university or whatever it happens to be

811
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:37,100
Now and I realize I know

812
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:41,660
You know, I I authentically know as do you that these things are trivial

813
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:45,900
And yet we we look at them as a marker of our own specialness and our own

814
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:49,420
Sense of accomplishment when I write them down

815
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:52,700
I acknowledge that I have the desire when I cross it out

816
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:57,260
I say I I have the desire, but I will not be attached to this goal

817
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:02,060
That you're you're you're physically negating the attachment from the goal

818
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:05,180
That I mean, of course the attachment on understanding, you know

819
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:11,180
Ducca is that concept to the first noble truth of Buddhism that life is suffering because of ducca because of this

820
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:15,740
Sticky craving for the inadequate things, but it is not saying I'm not going to do that

821
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:19,340
I'm not going to get that it's saying that I'm not going to be attached to that and it's incredible

822
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:21,580
This year on my birthday by the way

823
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:23,740
I got a big one coming man with a zero

824
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:30,380
My attachment that's bothering me right now. I'm going to admit it. I have too many political opinions

825
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:32,540
I really do

826
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:35,660
They're they're weighing me down. They're they're making it harder to have friends

827
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:41,500
Then they should be so I'm going to write down my 10 strongest political opinions and I'm going to cross them out

828
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:46,700
Not that I'm saying that I don't believe these things, but I'm not going to be attached to my rightness

829
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:50,940
That humility is going to set me free and that's a kind of a metaphor

830
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:53,900
Tick not ha on the great vietnamese buddhist monk

831
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:57,820
He wrote that our greatest attachments are to our opinions

832
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:00,780
And that's you know triply true for me right now

833
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:05,580
So man, I I need freedom and and I'm going to get it by by talking about

834
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:08,380
the wants that's just a house

835
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:10,300
that

836
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:14,300
Practice the exercise of writing down the things that you want and then crossing them out

837
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:19,740
Sounds great symbolically. Lovely the writing the physical writing of something lovely

838
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:25,180
Presumably that's not just a master key that downstream from that and yes, I'm still going to have it

839
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:27,420
But where are you going in your mind?

840
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:34,540
Is there a practice which is more repeatable and robust that when your desire to correct somebody about their view on abortion?

841
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:37,020
arises that

842
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:41,100
What where are you going to there to permanently be crossing it out?

843
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:46,220
You know what it does is it makes you remember the attachment in the moment of behavior

844
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:50,940
That's what that thing does. That's what the important thing is because when it's in your prefrontal cortex

845
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:53,260
then it's not

846
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:58,940
Then it's a behavior that is that is manageable in in the executive centers of your brain

847
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:01,500
And so what will you do instead?

848
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:06,700
When somebody sits down next to me and says something that I really just I don't believe about abortion

849
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:09,900
And I think that I think now I have my opportunity

850
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:12,300
Because my prefrontal cortex is managing and I say

851
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:15,180
Tell me why you think that

852
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:17,260
Would you please tell me why you think that?

853
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:20,780
And and you listen to learn it's an extraordinary thing

854
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:25,980
And by the way, you get smarter and you're wrong less often and you get less embarrassed and you lose fewer friends

855
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:28,620
And and when you do that the other person that you're talking to

856
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:35,340
I just gave a long lecture on the on the on the neuroscience of the absorption of messages and political communications

857
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:36,540
that I just get a lecture today

858
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:41,100
And one of the things that you find is the more that you do that the more people think that you're that that you're a

859
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:44,860
Very smart person who makes very good points and that your point of view is actually quite persuasive

860
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:48,540
To shocker how that happens

861
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:53,340
Can you you mentioned earlier on something I've heard you talk about before to do with the common idols?

862
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:57,340
That uh, people kind of get waylaid by can you just go through this?

863
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:03,260
Yeah, that was we mentioned that just a minute ago. That was the Aquinas four idols money power pleasure fame

864
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:08,220
money power pleasure fame now Aquinas asserted this is 1265 you didn't have data

865
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:12,140
But man he was the best and Aquinas said

866
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:18,460
That everybody falls prey to one of these things more than anything else that this is an exhaustive list

867
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:22,940
Of the things we care about the most now money is pretty obvious money or wealth it or you know

868
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:24,940
financial resources

869
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:30,780
Anything that actually allows you to buy stuff and shows that you're a very important person, you know that these markers these

870
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:33,900
um medium of exchange and store of value

871
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:41,180
The second is pleasure we've talked about and or power power is is the ability to control the behavior of others

872
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:45,900
And the last is actually a really kind of a you know a lot of people listening to us are like I don't care about fame

873
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:48,460
You know, I don't want to be instagram famous, but that's not it

874
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:52,460
It's really the prestige and the admiration of the right people

875
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:56,460
I mean if you can be completely screwed up if you were on the disney channel as a kid

876
01:02:56,860 --> 01:03:03,740
And what you want is the admiration of strangers and they're literally people's brains who are wired like that because they got famous before they were

877
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:09,180
While their brain was still in formation and they'll be like somebody who got addicted to methamphetamine as a 14 year old

878
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:11,900
They'll they'll never be normal is what we actually know

879
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:19,500
But but most aren't like that, but they still want to be considered somebody for the people whose whose opinions actually matter

880
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:23,180
Those are the four idols and I play a game with my students

881
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:26,620
What's my idol because once you know your idol

882
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:30,940
You can actually control your behavior and manage yourself in a much more effective way

883
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:33,580
You have to know your weakness is the way that this works out and a lot of people

884
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:36,940
It actually don't so do you want to play the game chris hit me you want to play?

885
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:39,500
What's my idol? Okay. I'm right the way to play

886
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:44,540
What's my idol is not for me to say what which of the four really controls you

887
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:49,340
Is to say which of the four do you not care about and start eliminating them?

888
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:54,460
Because then we're going to wind up on the one that's really harder for you. So money

889
01:03:55,180 --> 01:03:56,220
power

890
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:57,580
pleasure

891
01:03:57,580 --> 01:03:58,860
honor

892
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:01,900
You got to give away one. Which one are you going to give away power?

893
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:04,380
how come

894
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:06,220
I

895
01:04:06,220 --> 01:04:10,220
Don't notice in myself a desire to really accumulate power of any kind

896
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:13,260
Okay, so I'm going to make a prediction about you

897
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:16,620
You hate it when people have power over you. Oh, yeah

898
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:18,700
That's it

899
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:24,060
People who hate having people having power over them are averse to having power over other people as well

900
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:28,940
You're a non hierarchical person. You're a non hierarchical guy, right?

901
01:04:29,180 --> 01:04:33,180
Yeah, the the org structure of the business would suggest that as well. Yeah

902
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:37,340
Yeah, that's it's and that's almost always the case. Okay. Good. So now we've got money

903
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:39,100
pleasure

904
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:41,660
And fame or honor or prestige average

905
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:44,940
You got to give another one away and it's harder now. What are you going to give away next?

906
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:47,740
Uh money

907
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:50,300
Money how come

908
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:54,140
One of the of all of the different mental pathologies that I have

909
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:57,180
materialism

910
01:04:57,180 --> 01:04:59,180
a desire for sort of

911
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:05,100
Flashness in terms of possessions is just not something that I have. I have a degree of scarcity mindset

912
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:07,660
which

913
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:13,660
A abundance kind of ameliorates, but for me, it's just it's it's not something that I really think about very much

914
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:16,140
Did you grow up with nice things?

915
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:21,900
We were like lower working class. I think okay lower middle class kind of like lower working class

916
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:26,220
Oh lower working class. Okay. Like my wife grew up in Barcelona. So it was you know

917
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:30,460
Sometimes you paid the light bill and sometimes you didn't pay the light bill. Okay. You didn't grow up with nice things

918
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:33,260
This might be the case now when it comes to this

919
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:40,620
There's a very interesting set of sociological theories that you can never be actually comfortable more than one and a half classes

920
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:42,780
Above that in which you were a child

921
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:46,780
So if you were if you were kind of lower working class that means that

922
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:52,700
The tastes above upper middle class are going to be like that stuff is boring, man

923
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:58,300
That's that it's like you want me to collect art. Why would I spend my time collecting art?

924
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:01,740
I want to talk about stuff and ideas and things that actually excite me

925
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:03,340
And so that might be part of it

926
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:07,500
But also you've had a pretty a pretty I mean at age 36

927
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:11,660
You've had economic success beyond your wildest dreams, right?

928
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:16,780
And you probably figured out that there's not that much stuff that you can buy. That's really that fun

929
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:18,940
all right

930
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:24,460
As soon as you as soon as you can fly business class and not have to think about the cost of a coffee

931
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:29,660
Most stuff downstream from that. I mean, you know, there'll be some things once I get a family

932
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:33,580
There'll be I think that you kind of transcend your own desires in that way

933
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:37,420
And it's more to do with providing for the kids and so on and so forth

934
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:40,540
But yeah, you know

935
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:43,820
I'm very very glad of that and I think

936
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:46,540
Lots of people

937
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:53,020
Don't realize that they're kind of blessed by having no or a limited materialism set point

938
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:59,340
That like if you look at how much money you need in order to be happy with the worldly possessions that you have

939
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:01,980
With the degree of keeping up with the Joneses that you're motivated by

940
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:08,220
With the shows of affection and love and and gifting that you need to do to other people or that you need from other people in order to feel loved

941
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:10,540
If you don't have that

942
01:07:10,620 --> 01:07:16,220
That's basically like you needing you being a much more efficient system financially

943
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:19,820
Like there is somebody else out there who needs 10 times your salary

944
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:24,140
To get the same level of satisfaction out of life. So I

945
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:26,940
Reframed that probably about

946
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:34,700
Five years ago and just it's one of the things that I'm I genuinely feel blessed about whether that's from genes or or environment

947
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:38,220
I'm like, I don't need it and it's by the way, it's great

948
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:42,700
But it's not a super virtue because we haven't gotten your idol yet

949
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:45,740
We're getting that don't worry don't worry and we are getting back down to us soon

950
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:49,660
And what you find is that there are certain there are certain guys who are way

951
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:52,220
I mean, they they they they objectify themselves

952
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:59,500
With their relationship to money in the same way that women often do for the same reasons evolutionarily and and they're in their physical appearance

953
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:03,580
Why because this is going to predict your you know, sort of as a as a

954
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:07,500
Predictor of your success in mating markets despite the fact that you're not even in mating markets

955
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:12,700
So a lot of that's primordial and has to do with you know, what the idol is for all kinds of reasons that we could talk about

956
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:13,260
Okay

957
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:18,380
Now it's getting uncomfortable because there's two left and you've already through process of elimination told me that these are the

958
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:21,500
Things that you care about. Okay. So number one

959
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:26,460
um, you know, let's let's put these in order because you got to get rid of one of these pleasure

960
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:30,540
An honor you got to get one you got to get rid of one

961
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:33,420
Pleasure can go

962
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:35,820
You like pleasure, don't you but

963
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:37,820
But now I know what you're really like

964
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:39,820
I found out what you really want Chris

965
01:08:39,820 --> 01:08:45,020
It's not a surprise to anybody my desire for prestige to be recognized and validated by the world

966
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:50,620
I yeah, I know I know because you're doing this you're doing you're doing something you're performing in public

967
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:55,660
And most people who are you know, straw you're in a strong extrovert clearly you have openness to experience

968
01:08:55,740 --> 01:08:59,820
You have an agreeable nature. You're probably not highly neurotic

969
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:04,780
You've got all the things that actually go into somebody surprised if you if you if you do a big five on me

970
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:06,780
Uh, I come in

971
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:09,260
Uh, neuroticism is uh moderate

972
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:10,860
Uh

973
01:09:10,860 --> 01:09:14,220
Get most of my energy from being on my own. I'm an only child

974
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:17,740
Uh, I choose to work on my own. So, you know that

975
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:26,540
Turn it on turn it off thing. Um, it's definitely there. But yeah, I I'm glad that I've managed a lot as a an extroverted

976
01:09:26,540 --> 01:09:30,540
Loan neuroticism person, but uh, I fear that the source code may be slightly different

977
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:33,660
It might be it might be and you know, you don't know until you know

978
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:37,420
And and you know, there are people who present in a particular way and have a

979
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:42,300
Habitat that's quite different because they've been able to they're so good at getting along in society

980
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:45,980
But what we do know now is what your weakness is going to be

981
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:51,100
So five years from now, I predict you're going to be married and the argument you're going to be having with your wife

982
01:09:51,580 --> 01:09:56,140
Is because you're going to be doing something that's going to bring you new heights of success

983
01:09:56,780 --> 01:10:00,620
And your wife is and and then you're going to have this argument with your wife who's going to say

984
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:04,300
I don't want you to I want you to be around more chris

985
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:08,940
And you're going to say yeah, but you love all the great things that this lifestyle brings

986
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:13,020
And then you're mad at me for doing the things that it takes and she said I'll take you

987
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:17,500
I mean, I'm going to accept those things that don't have you but I'd prefer to have you

988
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:21,260
That's what I predict is the argument that you're going to actually have with your wife because

989
01:10:21,980 --> 01:10:23,820
You love success

990
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:28,140
You love success. It feels good. That's the thing that actually and what do I mean by it feels good

991
01:10:28,540 --> 01:10:31,740
That means it gives there's a lot of dopamine that comes from success

992
01:10:31,820 --> 01:10:35,420
Which gives you anticipation of reward and when you get the success

993
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:40,620
It taps the ventral tegmental area of the chris brain, which gives you this little burst of joy

994
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:46,620
That's what's happening when this one these weird things these markers of success actually happen and those things happen to be

995
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:50,140
That centering around the admiration of other people

996
01:10:50,540 --> 01:10:55,180
That you got to keep your eye on because all the mistakes you make in your life that you look back on with regret

997
01:10:55,180 --> 01:10:57,180
Are going to be because you follow that particular idol

998
01:10:58,460 --> 01:11:01,420
Meaning final holsman of the apocalypse

999
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:05,020
Yeah, so

1000
01:11:05,260 --> 01:11:07,260
This is the most important meaning

1001
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:11,900
I can go because I'm very disciplined. I can go a long time without

1002
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:15,420
Enjoyment and I can go a long time without satisfaction

1003
01:11:15,820 --> 01:11:18,220
But I can't go 10 minutes without meaning and be a happy person

1004
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:20,700
And this is the biggest problem that we have among young adults today

1005
01:11:21,260 --> 01:11:25,260
I have all kinds of tests that I give people to see whether or not they have a proper sense of meaning in their life

1006
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:27,500
And I'm not judgmental about what that meaning is going to be

1007
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:30,460
But I do know I can tell people

1008
01:11:31,180 --> 01:11:35,900
When they have a crisis of meaning and this is the biggest predictor of unhappiness for people in their 20s today

1009
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:41,340
Now most people in their 20s are actually not in the in the active pursuit of meaning

1010
01:11:41,420 --> 01:11:46,540
Whereas in about 1960 most people were in an active pursuit of meaning

1011
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:51,820
That's a big generate a set of generational differences that we have and it's a big one of the big

1012
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:55,100
The biggest explanations for the things that we talked about earlier

1013
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:58,860
Which is the degradation of of general societal happiness and particularly among the young

1014
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:03,660
So meaning is actually kind of a combination of three things. It's coherence

1015
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:06,300
Why things happen the way they do you have to have a

1016
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:11,900
A theory of the case about why things happen. It doesn't mean it has to be right or it has to be mine

1017
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:16,940
But you have to like this is why things happen yours tends to be very scientific about why things happen

1018
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:24,140
Second you have to have a sense of purpose purpose and meaning are not synonymous purpose is a subset of meaning

1019
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:30,700
That is direction and goals purpose is i'm going in a particular direction towards specific things

1020
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:32,940
That's what it comes down to

1021
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:36,620
And significance is the belief that your life matters

1022
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:39,740
So it's it's coherence

1023
01:12:39,740 --> 01:12:41,340
Purpose and significance

1024
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:44,620
Now there's a test that I give my students and by the way that I give my children

1025
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:47,820
My kids are younger than you my kids are in the all three of my kids are in the 20s

1026
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:51,260
And all three of my kids had to answer these questions

1027
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:54,940
I made them write a business plan when they were when they were coming out of high school

1028
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:59,340
You know, which is like a business plan for the enterprise of their lives for the next five years

1029
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:01,500
I'm a b-school professor. I can do this

1030
01:13:01,660 --> 01:13:05,260
And uh, and I'm the venture capitalist. So, you know, I deserve a business plan

1031
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:11,260
And and the point was what are you going to do to find the answers to two questions the two meaning questions?

1032
01:13:11,740 --> 01:13:13,500
Why are you alive?

1033
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:16,460
And for what are you willing to give your life joyfully at this hour?

1034
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:20,860
You need answers to those questions. You need to be alive for a reason

1035
01:13:21,340 --> 01:13:24,700
And you need to be willing to stop being alive for a reason

1036
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:27,340
those are the meaning questions so

1037
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:31,020
What are your answers? Why do you believe you're alive?

1038
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:33,260
Why are you on earth?

1039
01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:36,300
A sperm and an egg is not the right answer and a stork isn't either

1040
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:39,660
I think

1041
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:42,380
The thing that I often come back to when I ask myself this question is

1042
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:48,060
Uh to understand myself and the world around me. I get so much

1043
01:13:49,820 --> 01:13:51,820
Joy, I'm at my best when

1044
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:58,060
I'm learning about things and engaging with ideas downstream from that

1045
01:13:58,060 --> 01:14:01,180
I can teach you to other people and do all of the rest of the stuff, but um

1046
01:14:01,820 --> 01:14:06,860
Maybe I'm revealing my sort of only child bona fides here, but so much of it is just

1047
01:14:07,580 --> 01:14:10,700
me understanding myself and the world around me like that's

1048
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:15,020
It's been the single lineage trajectory throughout

1049
01:14:15,740 --> 01:14:17,740
All of the good things that I've done

1050
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:21,980
Yeah, no, and and you just told me what you want to do with this life that you have

1051
01:14:22,460 --> 01:14:26,960
What you enjoy the most where you find the greatest productivity, but this is a little bit different

1052
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:30,940
Why do you think that you were placed on this earth?

1053
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:34,620
What is the purpose for which you were placed on this earth?

1054
01:14:35,820 --> 01:14:40,060
Now if if you're a radical materialist, you might say it's just all random, man

1055
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:45,260
I wasn't I wasn't nobody down. Yeah. Yeah for sure. But my guess is you don't believe that

1056
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:48,780
Why why did the universe create Chris Williamson?

1057
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:54,860
I think to find and talk about good ideas that seems to be the thing that comes to me

1058
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:59,260
You want to serve others? You just told me why why do you want to talk about things?

1059
01:14:59,260 --> 01:15:03,020
Otherwise, you wouldn't bother we wouldn't be having we're having a conversation in public

1060
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:09,820
Why because we want people to listen to it and it might just be completely venal on your on my part because by the way

1061
01:15:10,220 --> 01:15:15,500
My idols map exactly onto yours. I'm the 60 year old version of you. Sorry

1062
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:18,060
I know I know it's like maybe you'll you'll still have hair

1063
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:22,700
If you're lucky, but but okay

1064
01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:29,020
If it's purely venal, that's just not good and that's a that's that's a bad answer to the question

1065
01:15:29,020 --> 01:15:32,220
but if it really is I want to serve the world by

1066
01:15:32,940 --> 01:15:34,940
uncovering its mysteries

1067
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:39,580
And in so doing people will be able to lead better informed better lives

1068
01:15:40,460 --> 01:15:42,460
In other words, you were created to serve

1069
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:44,620
In a certain way solid

1070
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:46,780
now it gets harder

1071
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:50,060
For what would you give your life joyfully at this at this hour?

1072
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:52,380
Mom dad and

1073
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:56,220
Like perhaps a golden retriever that's younger than five years old

1074
01:15:57,100 --> 01:16:00,940
Would you really give your life for your mom and dad? Yeah

1075
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:08,540
You would die for them despite the fact that they're significantly older. Yeah. I mean, they would they would be I would be in a lot of trouble

1076
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:11,900
But it's something that I would be prepared to do

1077
01:16:12,620 --> 01:16:17,260
There would absolutely as with almost anything I've ever had to do with them. There would be a very long portrayal

1078
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:21,180
Negotiation, which would all of us would be dead before that was finished. So it might be a moot question

1079
01:16:21,740 --> 01:16:25,900
It's a hard one and it's a especially hard question for young adults who don't have children yet

1080
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:28,140
It's a really hard one, right?

1081
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:32,300
Where are we getting that deepest sense of meaning from what is that that we've transcended ourselves with?

1082
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:36,380
You're like, you know, you know from the utilitarian perspective when you think

1083
01:16:36,380 --> 01:16:39,660
Ah, how much longer if mom and dad got left and what do they really want to do?

1084
01:16:39,660 --> 01:16:43,340
Ah, you know, what do you look at what you can give the world you haven't even passed on the genes yet?

1085
01:16:43,580 --> 01:16:49,260
Like even from their perspective, they would probably say even fuck you like just don't let especially because I'm an only child

1086
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:53,500
Like don't let the bloodline end here. Like god dammit. Like at least, you know, like

1087
01:16:54,460 --> 01:16:58,620
Come into a cup before you do this so that we can you know, you're some some lady in a turkey base to somewhere

1088
01:16:58,620 --> 01:17:03,100
I can actually keep this guy. I don't know. But yeah, it's uh, it's difficult one. It's difficult one, man

1089
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:07,340
Like to think about for sure. It wouldn't be like it wouldn't be my uh, country of birth

1090
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:10,140
and it wouldn't be my uh

1091
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:11,740
country of birth

1092
01:17:11,740 --> 01:17:16,700
And it wouldn't be my uh new country of adoption. It wouldn't be the faith that I don't have

1093
01:17:17,260 --> 01:17:18,940
uh, it wouldn't be the

1094
01:17:18,940 --> 01:17:20,940
sports team that I

1095
01:17:20,940 --> 01:17:22,940
barely keep up to date with

1096
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:26,460
What's your sports team by the way texas rangers?

1097
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:30,140
Really? Oh, yeah, I'm a bar. I'm a barsa man

1098
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:33,020
the um

1099
01:17:33,180 --> 01:17:39,980
Well, we both we've both swapped sports. I've followed an mlb team and you've followed a like Spanish football team

1100
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:43,420
I I married a catalan. There's no other way. There's no other way to

1101
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:47,340
Keep family harmony. Well, do you have a best friend?

1102
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:51,100
Yeah, would you would you would you die for him?

1103
01:17:53,740 --> 01:17:56,620
I definitely consider it. I bet you would

1104
01:17:59,020 --> 01:18:01,020
He's younger than me

1105
01:18:01,660 --> 01:18:05,660
The utilitarian and you again. Yeah, I fucking just can't get out can't get out the front of my brain

1106
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:10,860
But this is the point this is that this is the introspection that's required to actually find a full sense of meaning

1107
01:18:10,940 --> 01:18:15,580
This is worth going away for five days on a silent retreat and thinking about these questions

1108
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:21,820
And it's funny because you know, my adult kids have come to very different revelations about this because I push them push them push them push them

1109
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:25,980
I have a I have a son who's a sniper. I have a son who's a marine sniper

1110
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:30,140
Um, and he just got out of the Marine Corps now. He's he's he's in the reserves

1111
01:18:30,140 --> 01:18:34,780
But he was active duty for four years as a marine sniper. This is a this is a scary job, man

1112
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:41,980
For me as his father and he went in as a knucklehead, you know, and he came out at 23 married

1113
01:18:42,460 --> 01:18:44,700
He's now five months out. His wife is pregnant

1114
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:47,100
Um, and here's his answers

1115
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:52,860
I mean because he found his answers by by actually putting his life in danger and doing all these really like wicked things

1116
01:18:53,420 --> 01:18:54,940
um

1117
01:18:54,940 --> 01:19:00,380
My I was created because god made me to serve other people. You know, he believes that these are not the right answers

1118
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:06,700
These are his answers. Um, I would joyfully die for my faith and for my family and for my fellow marines

1119
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:11,100
And for the united states of america and our allies chris. So this is

1120
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:13,740
This is

1121
01:19:13,740 --> 01:19:21,180
Solid stuff and and he's i'm telling you he he actually has called me I screamed his call because he called while we were talking

1122
01:19:21,820 --> 01:19:28,940
Sorry sniper. Don't don't shoot me through the window. There's carlos. He's the best and he's six foot five and he's you know covered in tats

1123
01:19:29,660 --> 01:19:31,420
and um, he's

1124
01:19:31,420 --> 01:19:33,660
He's happy because he has these answers to these questions

1125
01:19:33,660 --> 01:19:37,980
But he did the work is really what it comes down to and this is what I recommend to a lot of people who feel

1126
01:19:38,460 --> 01:19:42,140
That little bit of hollowness that slight bit of deadness within

1127
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:47,180
Where things that i'm doing every day, you know, it's like, I don't know I don't want to stand in this line

1128
01:19:47,260 --> 01:19:52,700
What's the meaning of me actually drive sitting in traffic and doing this when you have the answers to those questions?

1129
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:56,860
There's a why for even the most trivial things that you're doing in your life

1130
01:19:57,020 --> 01:20:00,700
And that's a really really beautiful thing if I can do one thing for people

1131
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:06,060
It's actually to encourage them to look for the answers to those questions. How can we improve our coherence?

1132
01:20:07,820 --> 01:20:11,180
So our coherence is the why things happen the way that they do

1133
01:20:12,220 --> 01:20:16,940
And uh that theory of the case is really tricky, but it gets back to the sense of transcendence

1134
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:22,060
If you pursue a strategy of transcendence coherence comes in its wake

1135
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:25,980
Even if you can't quite articulate why things happen the way they do

1136
01:20:26,220 --> 01:20:29,020
You have a sense of why things happen the way that they do

1137
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:32,700
If you study dystoic philosophers with the utmost seriousness

1138
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:39,820
The understanding of why things happen the way they do even if they're random and even if they're unfair becomes acceptable to you

1139
01:20:39,980 --> 01:20:43,500
And that acceptance of that is a sense of coherence on its face

1140
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:50,940
Maybe you're a complete radically physicalist atheist who denies the utter existence of free will if you study the science

1141
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:57,980
With enough seriousness of that you can you can make your peace with a coherence that actually comes from the randomness of the universe

1142
01:20:58,060 --> 01:20:59,580
my father was a

1143
01:20:59,580 --> 01:21:02,780
phd biostatistician he was the smartest guy ever met

1144
01:21:03,580 --> 01:21:05,020
and um

1145
01:21:05,020 --> 01:21:09,020
He said when he was dying of cancer when he was more he was just a little bit older than me

1146
01:21:09,820 --> 01:21:11,820
and I said it's just

1147
01:21:12,220 --> 01:21:15,180
Sucks it's not fair and he said

1148
01:21:16,060 --> 01:21:18,380
Somebody's gonna be on the left side of the distribution

1149
01:21:21,820 --> 01:21:23,820
Hahaha

1150
01:21:28,060 --> 01:21:34,140
Spoken spoken like a man that looked at a lot of graphs throughout his career. It's coherence, baby

1151
01:21:35,740 --> 01:21:39,420
But you can get coherence in a lot of different ways. You just have to do the work

1152
01:21:40,220 --> 01:21:42,220
To figure out what you believe

1153
01:21:42,860 --> 01:21:44,860
purpose

1154
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:50,620
Purpose to to to create the goals and the directionality of your life

1155
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:54,380
Now this is not a sense of attachment a lot of people will say well

1156
01:21:54,460 --> 01:21:56,380
I'm gonna make my bucket list

1157
01:21:56,380 --> 01:22:02,060
And I'm gonna earn this and I'm gonna do that and I'm gonna meet this person and I'm gonna you know shake hands with the president

1158
01:22:02,140 --> 01:22:08,780
I don't know whatever the dumb thing is that people are really into that's not it the buddhist talk about intentionality without attachment

1159
01:22:09,660 --> 01:22:15,100
Now there's a there's a the way to think about purpose. There's a do you speak Spanish right chris? No

1160
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:19,580
Okay, there's a word in Spanish. It's a very evocative word is rumbo

1161
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:26,460
Which in in English is it's not common. It's called rum line rhum rum line. It's a navigational term

1162
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:28,700
That's the straight line

1163
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:31,660
That goes from where you are to where you want to wind up

1164
01:22:32,220 --> 01:22:38,140
To do navigation properly you need a rum line rumbo is actually used in Spanish in the vernacular to say

1165
01:22:38,380 --> 01:22:41,660
This is your directionality. This is to figure out your purpose in life

1166
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:47,820
What you need to figure out is where you think it would be good to end up to have a straight line to get there

1167
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:53,180
And then have a complete utter lack of attachment on whether or not you're sitting on that rum line

1168
01:22:54,140 --> 01:22:58,380
That turns out to be the way to understand purpose. That's intention without attachment

1169
01:22:58,780 --> 01:23:00,620
Of course, I'm going to lay out the things that I want to do

1170
01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:03,100
Of course, I'm going to and I am completely

1171
01:23:04,140 --> 01:23:08,860
Flexible if life takes me in another direction for something that actually meets my moral

1172
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:15,020
Metaphysical my love goals in a better way. That's the way to actually be thinking about purpose

1173
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:16,860
if

1174
01:23:16,860 --> 01:23:19,180
Suffering and difficulty are so important to meaning

1175
01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:22,300
How do you advise new parents who are

1176
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:25,100
Successful because of the challenges in their past

1177
01:23:25,420 --> 01:23:27,420
But now have more resources

1178
01:23:27,580 --> 01:23:31,740
To make life easier for their kids than their parents did when they were growing up

1179
01:23:32,060 --> 01:23:37,020
That by using the things that they've worked for they may rob their children of the very challenges that would make them happy

1180
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:40,860
Yeah, guilty by the way guilty guilty is charged

1181
01:23:41,580 --> 01:23:44,140
You know, I'd say it's a the greatest

1182
01:23:44,780 --> 01:23:48,460
Privilege is feeling like you've had a lot of success and you earned it

1183
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:51,100
That's an incredible privilege

1184
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:57,100
The greatest I mean the the the worst thing you can do for your children is making them wonder whether or not they earned their success

1185
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:59,900
Like did I did it was a me or is it my dad?

1186
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:05,580
You know, was somebody kicking down the door for me. Am I a baby nebo? I mean what what what right?

1187
01:24:05,660 --> 01:24:08,940
That's a real problem and a lot of that has to do with the fact that that we're

1188
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:13,900
We're simply trying to make it so that the difficulties are cleared away exactly as you say

1189
01:24:14,140 --> 01:24:16,300
This leads to a lot of problems that we see today

1190
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:20,460
Safetyism, you know, the fact that we're we're completely

1191
01:24:20,940 --> 01:24:27,100
Freaked out about a lot of difficulties that don't exist and we're and we're inured to the problems that really do exist

1192
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:30,380
So we don't let our kids walk to the store, but we give them, you know

1193
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:34,460
As you know unlimited access to smartphones and social media

1194
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:40,540
at age 13 and like predators and creeps and god forbid politicians and you know

1195
01:24:41,580 --> 01:24:48,460
Dictators on tiktok. Yeah, our are climbing out of the screen and into their brains and you know and and and

1196
01:24:48,940 --> 01:24:53,340
Destroying their sense of self-worth and and creating social comparison and all these deleterious things

1197
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:58,060
What we need to do is to set our kids up to do really hard things

1198
01:24:58,780 --> 01:25:02,940
And and and it's telling them that it's okay if they fail

1199
01:25:03,740 --> 01:25:07,820
Not because what we tell them when we're when we're protecting them from everything is that it's not okay to fail

1200
01:25:08,220 --> 01:25:13,820
And we create a pathological fear of failure, which is a death fear. We're giving our kids a death fear

1201
01:25:14,700 --> 01:25:16,700
Death all death is

1202
01:25:16,860 --> 01:25:19,820
Is the death of who you are to you? There's an essence to you

1203
01:25:19,820 --> 01:25:22,940
So a client would say that your soul is your christness

1204
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:25,660
That a dog's soul is this dogginess

1205
01:25:26,380 --> 01:25:28,060
Each one of us has an essence to us

1206
01:25:28,060 --> 01:25:31,180
No, we define that essence on the basis of who we see ourselves

1207
01:25:31,420 --> 01:25:38,060
And if you are never allowed to fail you become the person who doesn't fail and failure becomes a death fear for you

1208
01:25:38,220 --> 01:25:40,460
Why would you install a death fear on your kids?

1209
01:25:40,780 --> 01:25:43,580
Well, because you want to keep them safe and that's a terrible thing to do

1210
01:25:43,660 --> 01:25:47,740
So the way to get beyond that even if you're blessed with tremendous financial resources

1211
01:25:47,740 --> 01:25:49,740
So they don't have to worry about making rent

1212
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:54,540
When they're kids they don't have to worry about getting their caloric needs is you have to say

1213
01:25:54,700 --> 01:25:57,740
I expect you to be doing difficult things

1214
01:25:58,300 --> 01:26:03,900
And I don't expect you to succeed all the time if you're not failing enough. You're not doing it, right?

1215
01:26:04,060 --> 01:26:07,820
That's and and and okay now you're gonna say how do I do that? Okay. Here's how you do it

1216
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:13,100
Do it yourself. It does not matter what you tell your kids all that matters is what they see

1217
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:15,900
If you want your kids to grow up in the catholic faith

1218
01:26:16,540 --> 01:26:21,020
Make sure that they see you on your knees on sunday. That's all that matters

1219
01:26:21,580 --> 01:26:26,540
If you want your kids to do hard things do hard things if you want your kids to deal with failure fail

1220
01:26:27,180 --> 01:26:29,980
And and have them see you'll see how you fail and that's why

1221
01:26:30,540 --> 01:26:34,140
these lessons in modern wisdom are important for 60 year olds and 20 year olds and

1222
01:26:34,780 --> 01:26:36,780
kids

1223
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:39,100
Talk to me about the difference between

1224
01:26:39,580 --> 01:26:41,580
happiness and unhappiness

1225
01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:49,180
Is unhappiness simply the absence of happiness? Are they different networks the ways to avoid them separately?

1226
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:53,420
Happiness is not the opposite opposite of unhappiness on the contrary

1227
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:55,980
So the the experience of happiness has a lot to do with

1228
01:26:56,460 --> 01:27:01,260
But positive emotion and the experience of unhappiness has a lot to do with negative emotion

1229
01:27:01,820 --> 01:27:05,340
We go through life with different kinds of positive and negative moods

1230
01:27:05,340 --> 01:27:09,500
And they're largely produced in different with different structures of the limbic system of the brain

1231
01:27:09,740 --> 01:27:14,780
Because we're reacting to different outside circumstances some of which are opportunities and some of which are threats

1232
01:27:15,020 --> 01:27:21,500
So it makes perfect sense that that unhappiness is not the absence of happiness. These are different sensations

1233
01:27:21,740 --> 01:27:24,860
Largely unhappiness is experienced on the right side of the brain

1234
01:27:25,420 --> 01:27:30,220
And unhappiness on the left side of the brain and we know this because of the musculature of the face when people are experiencing

1235
01:27:30,300 --> 01:27:33,420
A lot of negative emotion the left side of the face is more active

1236
01:27:33,900 --> 01:27:38,460
And you can tell you know when somebody's about to cry the left side of their face is more active

1237
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:42,300
It twitches a little bit you get when you're when you're married you'll see this

1238
01:27:43,980 --> 01:27:45,980
And you're like, uh-oh

1239
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:49,100
You get like a five second warning. It's just amazing

1240
01:27:49,740 --> 01:27:53,660
If you you know, it's like it's what it's like if your husband is studies neuroscience

1241
01:27:53,820 --> 01:28:00,300
So it's important that we understand that because then we can manage both our happiness and our unhappiness and we can see

1242
01:28:01,260 --> 01:28:03,100
Which is a greater?

1243
01:28:03,100 --> 01:28:05,100
Which is a greater challenge?

1244
01:28:05,180 --> 01:28:11,900
Happiness or unhappiness in our lives for me happiness is not the greater challenge for me unhappiness is a greater challenge

1245
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:13,900
I have very high negative affect

1246
01:28:14,140 --> 01:28:20,380
I'm a normal i'm a naturally negative affect person because I fall in this personality characteristic called the mad scientist

1247
01:28:20,620 --> 01:28:24,380
Which is unusually high positive mood and unusually high negative mood

1248
01:28:24,860 --> 01:28:28,780
That's important thing for us to understand that that that that you know

1249
01:28:29,420 --> 01:28:30,860
Which is your challenge?

1250
01:28:30,860 --> 01:28:36,380
And so I'm spending a lot of my effort managing my unhappiness as opposed to trying to boost my happiness

1251
01:28:36,780 --> 01:28:41,580
And there are lots of there are terrible ways to do that like drinking alcohol looking at pornography gambling

1252
01:28:42,540 --> 01:28:47,900
Workaholism the best way to do that by the way is vigorous physical exercise seven days a week

1253
01:28:48,060 --> 01:28:50,940
And so that's what I do to start my day the first hour of the morning

1254
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:53,660
Not because I'm some sort of you know, look

1255
01:28:54,380 --> 01:28:56,380
vanity doesn't favor me

1256
01:28:56,620 --> 01:28:58,620
The reason that I do that is because

1257
01:28:59,180 --> 01:29:01,180
Um, I I want to feel less unhappy

1258
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:08,620
So there are different pathways for making people more happy versus making people less unhappy

1259
01:29:09,340 --> 01:29:15,420
And all of the stuff that we've gone through so far although fantastic and maybe great for refining your happiness level

1260
01:29:15,980 --> 01:29:17,980
you can still be

1261
01:29:18,540 --> 01:29:23,900
Pressing the accelerator harder whilst you've still got the brake pushed down if you don't look at these things which cause unhappiness

1262
01:29:23,980 --> 01:29:27,100
So what are the other biggest strategies beyond?

1263
01:29:27,980 --> 01:29:30,860
High intensity training that you do seven days a week. What are the

1264
01:29:31,740 --> 01:29:33,260
highest return

1265
01:29:33,260 --> 01:29:35,260
Uh tactics that you use

1266
01:29:35,260 --> 01:29:37,260
Clear away the barriers to your happiness

1267
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:42,620
Because one of the sources of unhappiness is not having access to the sources of happiness in your life

1268
01:29:42,940 --> 01:29:45,740
That's a source of aggravation and frustration

1269
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:53,020
So clear away the barriers by by by getting rid of your prejudices against trying to develop your faith or spiritual life

1270
01:29:53,980 --> 01:29:59,340
Clear away the barriers to the prejudices that you have and and the the difficulties that you have toward family life

1271
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:01,100
friendship

1272
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:05,260
The the behavior and attitudes that you have toward work, etc. That's really important

1273
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:10,060
third and probably for many people the most important is taking seriously the

1274
01:30:10,700 --> 01:30:13,180
mood disorders that are so common in our society today

1275
01:30:13,740 --> 01:30:20,700
understanding the essence of what what chronic and and and generalized anxiety is all about in people's lives what

1276
01:30:21,180 --> 01:30:27,260
What clinical depression actually means and how to treat it because the greatest source of unhappiness and misery for a lot of people

1277
01:30:27,260 --> 01:30:27,980
It's just

1278
01:30:27,980 --> 01:30:29,660
Straight on common mood disorders

1279
01:30:29,660 --> 01:30:34,060
And they can't actually even get to the better things in their lives because of these barriers that are actually coming in the

1280
01:30:34,380 --> 01:30:36,380
In terms of these sources of unhappiness

1281
01:30:36,380 --> 01:30:38,380
That's the big ones that i'm talking about

1282
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:39,740
general

1283
01:30:39,740 --> 01:30:45,580
High levels of negative affect that do not go into mood disorder. I strongly recommend physical diet and exercise

1284
01:30:45,740 --> 01:30:50,380
You know the the kinds of self care that that have a lot of discomfort attached to them

1285
01:30:50,860 --> 01:30:56,380
Always be thinking about the hygiene of removing barriers to your happiness and taking care of your mental health

1286
01:30:56,540 --> 01:30:58,540
Those are the best ways to think about it

1287
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:02,300
Why do you think it is in the modern world that

1288
01:31:03,020 --> 01:31:05,500
Anxiety appears to be the most prevalent

1289
01:31:06,380 --> 01:31:10,220
emotional state that people are in why has that one emotion

1290
01:31:11,260 --> 01:31:13,260
grabbed a hold of

1291
01:31:13,340 --> 01:31:15,340
the 21st century so much

1292
01:31:15,580 --> 01:31:20,540
Anxiety is unfocused fear fear is a natural physiological phenomenon that

1293
01:31:20,940 --> 01:31:22,940
that comes from

1294
01:31:22,940 --> 01:31:27,180
A stimulus that that that then lights up the amygdala in the brain passing a

1295
01:31:28,460 --> 01:31:31,260
A signal through the hypothalamus into the pituitary glands thus

1296
01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:37,980
Leading to the adrenal glands putting out epinephrine and later on cortisol stress hormones in response to some sort of a threat

1297
01:31:38,060 --> 01:31:41,900
That should be intense and episodic the problem in modern life

1298
01:31:42,380 --> 01:31:47,100
Is that that we don't have these intense episodic episodes of fear on the contrary

1299
01:31:47,100 --> 01:31:51,420
We have we have minor threats that are very diffuse but chronic

1300
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:55,820
And that is that leads to an unfocused fear aka anxiety

1301
01:31:55,820 --> 01:32:01,260
Which is a very slight drip of cortisol going into your brain again and again and again and again

1302
01:32:01,420 --> 01:32:03,420
And how do you get it by opening up twitter?

1303
01:32:03,580 --> 01:32:08,140
How do you get it by by being on a you know an overly long zoom call when you need to pee?

1304
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:12,380
How do you get it by actually being in a you know a work relationship?

1305
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:19,260
That's ridiculously tense that you're not doing anything about modern life is all about not having your life threatened

1306
01:32:19,340 --> 01:32:23,340
But feeling constantly under a little bit of threat which gives you unfocused fear

1307
01:32:23,660 --> 01:32:29,180
That leads to a stress response that comes from your adrenal glands and that gives you a tremendous amount of agony

1308
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:31,500
That's just spread out and constant

1309
01:32:34,780 --> 01:32:36,460
I

1310
01:32:36,460 --> 01:32:39,020
One of the things that you've mentioned that you you said that you have a

1311
01:32:39,980 --> 01:32:43,900
Disposition toward negative emotional states

1312
01:32:44,700 --> 01:32:48,780
How much have you found in your practice and also with yourself that people can?

1313
01:32:49,740 --> 01:32:51,740
Rewrite their childhood and their past history

1314
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:54,300
Because I think a lot of people feel

1315
01:32:54,780 --> 01:33:01,260
Trapped by their past and that they're stuck in their patterns and that you know this all sounds well and good Arthur

1316
01:33:01,260 --> 01:33:08,700
But really what you're talking about is sort of putting a little bit of icing and some sprinkles on the top of a dog

1317
01:33:08,780 --> 01:33:09,900
cake

1318
01:33:09,900 --> 01:33:14,060
You can rewrite your past you can't actually make a different past

1319
01:33:14,060 --> 01:33:17,260
What you can do is is understand your memories in different ways

1320
01:33:17,260 --> 01:33:22,380
And it starts with an understanding of how memory actually works in the brain memories are not extant

1321
01:33:22,460 --> 01:33:27,180
They're reassembled from all different kinds of parts. That's the reason that memory is so unreliable

1322
01:33:27,660 --> 01:33:32,940
You can remember with incredible vividness what happened on 9 11. I was in new york on 9 11

1323
01:33:33,020 --> 01:33:35,660
I saw the first plane hit the first tower

1324
01:33:36,380 --> 01:33:38,780
I mean it was I remember it vividly

1325
01:33:39,020 --> 01:33:44,940
But but the data show that what I remember vividly is probably not completely accurate because I'm

1326
01:33:45,340 --> 01:33:48,220
Reassembling that memory so frequently from different literally

1327
01:33:48,220 --> 01:33:51,340
I mean the different parts of the memory are stored in different locations in the brain

1328
01:33:51,740 --> 01:33:56,060
And those will get corrupted just like files will get corrupted in a computer from time to time

1329
01:33:56,380 --> 01:34:00,780
And one of the ways that will get corrupted is because of the biases that I have in my ordinary life

1330
01:34:01,340 --> 01:34:04,940
This is the reason that you and your sister I realize you don't have a sister

1331
01:34:04,940 --> 01:34:09,020
But if you had a sister you and your sister could be looking back to a Thanksgiving 15 years ago

1332
01:34:09,020 --> 01:34:11,100
Which I realized you didn't have and have because you're british

1333
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:17,900
But and and one of you could say oh that Thanksgiving with uncle mark and aunt betty

1334
01:34:18,220 --> 01:34:22,460
It was so great and your sister was like wasn't that the wasn't that the one where uncle mark

1335
01:34:23,180 --> 01:34:28,060
Got you know blind drunk and and then beat up the neighbor and passed out in the front yard

1336
01:34:28,940 --> 01:34:30,940
That was terrible that year

1337
01:34:31,020 --> 01:34:36,140
You're both right, but you're assembling the memories from different places with biases and emphases

1338
01:34:36,620 --> 01:34:41,340
Placed in different parts of the memory with different corruptions that have happened across the decades

1339
01:34:41,980 --> 01:34:46,540
That's a really important thing because you can reassemble your memories in different ways

1340
01:34:47,420 --> 01:34:53,100
By by helping people to emphasize the parts of the experiences in your past that were positive and not just negative

1341
01:34:53,340 --> 01:34:55,340
Some people are retrospectively

1342
01:34:55,340 --> 01:34:57,180
unbelievably negative

1343
01:34:57,180 --> 01:35:02,060
And and that has everything to do with the way that they've stored and are reassembling their memories

1344
01:35:02,700 --> 01:35:04,700
And and you don't have to do that

1345
01:35:04,780 --> 01:35:09,260
You can actually choose to look back on the parts of your childhood that actually were sweet

1346
01:35:09,340 --> 01:35:13,360
And the more that you do that the better you'll get at doing that and the more that you'll naturally

1347
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:17,340
Reassemble those memories in ways that favor you more and you're not wrong

1348
01:35:17,820 --> 01:35:23,180
You're just looking at different parts of the experience and repairing the you know the memory the memory assembly process

1349
01:35:23,740 --> 01:35:29,100
Yeah, I love that. What about the role of envy another emotion that's very prevalent in the modern world?

1350
01:35:29,420 --> 01:35:31,420
What what is that to say about envy?

1351
01:35:31,420 --> 01:35:35,980
It's evolved and the reason is because we live in a hierarchical kin based species

1352
01:35:36,620 --> 01:35:39,660
We actually were tropical. We're a tropical species

1353
01:35:40,540 --> 01:35:46,220
Evolved to live in kin groups that are hierarchical now some of that we can get beyond like, you know

1354
01:35:46,220 --> 01:35:50,140
We invented coats so we don't have to live in really hot places anymore

1355
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:54,060
But some of it we haven't gotten beyond we're still kin based and we are still

1356
01:35:54,540 --> 01:36:00,780
Very hierarchical and the way that you you tend to see your likelihood of survival and gene propagation

1357
01:36:01,020 --> 01:36:06,540
Is rising in the hierarchy and the way that you know that you're rising in the hierarchy is paying attention to people who have more than you

1358
01:36:07,180 --> 01:36:11,340
And wanting what people have who have more than you a k a n b now

1359
01:36:11,980 --> 01:36:16,460
That's a big I mean, that's a that's a survival tendency in in the Pleistocene

1360
01:36:16,540 --> 01:36:22,220
But it's a it's maladapted to the to the modern world and it's exacerbated by the technological

1361
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:28,620
Innovations that we've had such that we're aware of the hierarchy of the entire human race all the time

1362
01:36:29,180 --> 01:36:30,300
on social media

1363
01:36:30,300 --> 01:36:33,980
The biggest problem that we have is you don't feel envious of you know, the loser

1364
01:36:34,460 --> 01:36:37,660
You know down the street from you who has a slightly different

1365
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:41,900
You know rv up on blocks in his yard compared to yours

1366
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:43,900
you envy

1367
01:36:43,900 --> 01:36:49,500
The Kardashians, which is completely absurd you have you you envy somebody who's got

1368
01:36:50,060 --> 01:36:54,460
You know all the wealth in the world you envy a billionaire despite the fact that you've never met one in person

1369
01:36:54,700 --> 01:36:59,020
So that's the biggest problem that we've taken an evolutionary tendency and we've blown it up with tech

1370
01:36:59,180 --> 01:37:02,300
With our technological means and turned it into an actual form of mental illness

1371
01:37:03,340 --> 01:37:09,820
That means that we have to take it on on his face and use our prefrontal cortex to combat these limbic tendencies that are ruining your lives

1372
01:37:10,380 --> 01:37:12,060
That's a lot of what I talk about

1373
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:17,420
You mean making sure that you're you're you're consciously not comparing yourself to people outside your group

1374
01:37:17,980 --> 01:37:23,740
To you know to if you need to get rid of the apps and stop paying attention to these rich people

1375
01:37:23,900 --> 01:37:27,740
Only because you enjoy watching the lifestyles of these rich and famous folks

1376
01:37:28,140 --> 01:37:30,140
That's an unhealthy thing for you to do

1377
01:37:30,700 --> 01:37:33,580
A lot of the things that I often talk about to get rid of this as well is to

1378
01:37:34,060 --> 01:37:37,180
Is is to to separate your envy from from benign

1379
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:43,020
From the malicious malicious envy is that you feel envious of people who have something that you don't feel that they've earned

1380
01:37:43,660 --> 01:37:49,580
Ignore that and pay attention to where you have benign envy where you think that they've done something that's really virtuous

1381
01:37:49,900 --> 01:37:51,900
And turn your envy into admiration

1382
01:37:52,620 --> 01:37:58,060
And then you've actually made it into something that's really beneficial that will benefit you and won't make the world worse

1383
01:37:59,180 --> 01:38:01,180
Yeah, it's so interesting to think about how

1384
01:38:02,140 --> 01:38:03,260
that

1385
01:38:03,260 --> 01:38:05,260
very adaptive

1386
01:38:05,420 --> 01:38:09,900
Impulse that we had I need to track my place within the hierarchy, but you know

1387
01:38:10,700 --> 01:38:15,180
That was 150 people if that it was probably actually 70 people

1388
01:38:15,580 --> 01:38:21,580
Probably 30 70 and yeah, just speaking of what we were talking about earlier on when we were discussing the

1389
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:30,940
Slot that your intimate partner takes up. I had robin dunbar. He's been on the show twice now. Maybe three times. He's so

1390
01:38:31,660 --> 01:38:36,060
Fantastic the first time I ever recorded with him. It was I think 8 p.m. On a Friday

1391
01:38:36,620 --> 01:38:43,420
Evening in the uk 2 p.m. Here in austin and he just had a big glass of wine that he slowly worked his way through as he was just

1392
01:38:44,380 --> 01:38:45,900
unloading

1393
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:49,100
evolutionary psychology social psychology insights, but

1394
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:54,460
One of the you know, you've got this sort of small group within maybe a slightly larger tribe

1395
01:38:54,780 --> 01:38:58,380
And you can track your place within that hierarchy relatively easily

1396
01:38:58,460 --> 01:39:03,900
But if envy is the only one of the seven deadly sins that doesn't feel good, which is kind of an interesting insight

1397
01:39:04,460 --> 01:39:07,820
Not even fun. Not even fun. Not even fun to do it. Um

1398
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:13,980
You have essentially an unlimited way that an envious mind can find to

1399
01:39:14,460 --> 01:39:18,140
Subjugate you below someone else. Well, yeah, sure

1400
01:39:18,380 --> 01:39:19,580
I've got more money than them

1401
01:39:19,580 --> 01:39:23,980
But they seem to be a little bit better educated than me or their wife slightly hotter or they drive a faster car

1402
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:27,420
Or you know, they seem to be a bit more muscular or or whatever like, you know

1403
01:39:27,500 --> 01:39:30,700
There's a million different ways that you can do this with now

1404
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:33,500
essentially an unlimited global

1405
01:39:33,900 --> 01:39:36,940
Marketplace hierarchy within which you can compare yourself

1406
01:39:37,580 --> 01:39:40,780
Yeah, this is one of the reasons that men have now become orthorexic

1407
01:39:41,420 --> 01:39:43,580
You know that men men are now weirdly

1408
01:39:44,220 --> 01:39:44,940
um

1409
01:39:44,940 --> 01:39:51,100
Comparing their biceps men my age are paying attention to you know, the you know, they're

1410
01:39:51,660 --> 01:39:56,780
Physical prowess by looking at, you know, these youtube channels in ways that we wouldn't have any concept of it

1411
01:39:56,780 --> 01:39:58,540
They were to live happily

1412
01:39:58,540 --> 01:40:01,580
But instead they're like, I don't know man. I think I need to go on trt

1413
01:40:02,380 --> 01:40:05,660
Why because I don't know. I mean, I'm looking at all these other guys. They look great

1414
01:40:05,980 --> 01:40:08,620
You wouldn't even have a you wouldn't be conscious of this. You'd be, you know

1415
01:40:08,780 --> 01:40:11,180
Happily living your life in your own silo

1416
01:40:11,740 --> 01:40:15,980
But this exposure that we have to this massive comparison group is

1417
01:40:16,140 --> 01:40:20,700
unbelievably unhealthy because you're always doing this hierarchically

1418
01:40:21,500 --> 01:40:22,700
evolved

1419
01:40:22,700 --> 01:40:26,620
Thing this tendency this habit that we actually have and you have to combat it on purpose

1420
01:40:26,620 --> 01:40:29,740
There's no way that you're just going to make it go away by by changing your environment

1421
01:40:30,140 --> 01:40:33,340
This brings up one key point by the way because of all these things that we're talking about

1422
01:40:33,740 --> 01:40:39,580
It's very efficient inefficient to try to improve your life by changing the whole outside world

1423
01:40:40,300 --> 01:40:43,740
It's very inefficient to curate the entire outside world

1424
01:40:44,060 --> 01:40:46,060
It's efficient to work on it yourself

1425
01:40:46,620 --> 01:40:53,660
By moving your experiences from your limbic system into your prefrontal cortex aka to be metacognitive. That's why that's what I talk about all the time

1426
01:40:54,620 --> 01:40:56,460
We've gone through a lot of the big

1427
01:40:56,460 --> 01:40:59,260
Sexy things I think from your recent thesis

1428
01:41:00,220 --> 01:41:01,820
Is there anything

1429
01:41:01,820 --> 01:41:05,180
from your book or from your work and from this kind of domain of work in general

1430
01:41:06,140 --> 01:41:07,340
that

1431
01:41:07,340 --> 01:41:09,660
people you wish people paid more attention to

1432
01:41:10,140 --> 01:41:14,300
Is there something that is seemingly unpopular and sexy but

1433
01:41:14,940 --> 01:41:21,660
Has more bang for its buck that you wish you could bestow more people to remember it when you when they read stuff that you've put out

1434
01:41:22,460 --> 01:41:24,460
Yeah, I mean

1435
01:41:25,260 --> 01:41:27,260
There's a concept that people don't

1436
01:41:27,980 --> 01:41:34,460
Pay attention to very much because our world is largely been organized over the past 30 years

1437
01:41:35,340 --> 01:41:36,700
by

1438
01:41:36,700 --> 01:41:37,900
by

1439
01:41:37,900 --> 01:41:39,900
technicians engineers and bureaucrats

1440
01:41:40,780 --> 01:41:47,500
We've actually we've handed the keys in our culture over to people that say that if we can solve a series of complicated problems

1441
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:49,500
We'll live in peace and happiness forever

1442
01:41:50,540 --> 01:41:56,140
That's a completely misguided understanding of the human experience. There's two kinds of problems in life

1443
01:41:56,860 --> 01:41:59,420
There's complicated problems that engineers solve

1444
01:41:59,980 --> 01:42:01,980
these are problems that are

1445
01:42:02,460 --> 01:42:06,300
ferociously hard to solve but once you solve them you can replicate them with effortless ease

1446
01:42:07,180 --> 01:42:11,740
That's like making a toaster or a jet engine. Those are complicated problems

1447
01:42:12,380 --> 01:42:15,900
All the problems that we really care about in life are complex problems

1448
01:42:15,980 --> 01:42:23,500
Which is to say that they're very easy to understand the solution and completely impossible to solve because they're dynamic in nature

1449
01:42:24,860 --> 01:42:28,940
Your toaster is complicated. Your cat is complicated is complex

1450
01:42:29,580 --> 01:42:35,580
It's you know what it wants. It's warmth and scratches and a litter box and food

1451
01:42:35,740 --> 01:42:37,740
But you never know what it's going to do

1452
01:42:37,740 --> 01:42:39,740
That's why it's interesting

1453
01:42:39,740 --> 01:42:43,820
Your your marriage is complex, right? It's very complex

1454
01:42:43,820 --> 01:42:45,900
You know what it means to be happy in your marriage

1455
01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:51,500
But you can't get there with any amount of stuff and any amount of money and any amount of technology

1456
01:42:52,060 --> 01:42:54,060
A war is complex

1457
01:42:54,540 --> 01:42:59,740
I win they lose that's the solution. How do you get there? I don't know a football game. Look, you like sports

1458
01:42:59,740 --> 01:43:04,380
I like sports. I love barca. I love watching soccer. I love watching spanish premier league soccer

1459
01:43:05,180 --> 01:43:08,620
You know the best days barca wins, but I don't know that's why I watch

1460
01:43:09,100 --> 01:43:12,620
Because it's a complex thing the biggest mistake that we make

1461
01:43:13,340 --> 01:43:19,820
Is thinking and a lot of what we've talked about in this episode comes down to this is thinking that my complex human problems

1462
01:43:19,900 --> 01:43:23,260
Are going to be solved by external complicated solutions

1463
01:43:23,740 --> 01:43:25,740
And that's what the world keeps trying to tell me

1464
01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:33,180
The world says if you take this and you try that and you buy this and you adopt that

1465
01:43:33,900 --> 01:43:36,700
Then you're finally going to be happy and it's not true

1466
01:43:37,420 --> 01:43:39,420
It isn't true. Here's the thing about life

1467
01:43:40,300 --> 01:43:43,660
Life comes down to the complex problems of the heart

1468
01:43:43,980 --> 01:43:48,940
Which are all about love and you can't solve that with a product you can only

1469
01:43:49,740 --> 01:43:52,140
You can only live that in real time

1470
01:43:53,340 --> 01:44:00,460
You want a better life live it in real time be fully alive right now suffer with it experience it

1471
01:44:01,020 --> 01:44:05,660
That's what you have to do. That's what we had to do two million years ago. And that's what we still have to do today

1472
01:44:06,620 --> 01:44:10,460
Hell yeah, Arthur Brooks ladies and gentlemen Arthur is been really great

1473
01:44:10,460 --> 01:44:17,020
I I adore this sort of blend that you have of eastern and western of sort of neuroscience with the mindful with

1474
01:44:17,580 --> 01:44:22,940
It's it's really really great. I'm very very glad that we stopped circling each other and finally managed to sit down

1475
01:44:22,940 --> 01:44:24,700
I look forward to speaking to you again soon as well

1476
01:44:25,260 --> 01:44:28,620
Where should people go? They want to keep up to date with all of the things that you're doing

1477
01:44:28,620 --> 01:44:30,140
Where do you want to send them?

1478
01:44:30,140 --> 01:44:35,340
arthurbrooks.com that gives you you know links that write a column every week in the atlantic on the science of happiness every

1479
01:44:35,340 --> 01:44:39,980
Thursday morning and it has the books and has you know the videos and the workshops a lot of free stuff and

1480
01:44:40,620 --> 01:44:44,300
Surveys and and and clips to my favorite podcast like modern wisdom

1481
01:44:44,780 --> 01:44:50,540
Well, that is the way that I wanted to hear you finish out dude. I really appreciate you. It's been really really great to catch up

1482
01:44:51,180 --> 01:44:57,020
Thanks. Thanks for what you're doing. You've made my life better and you're making millions of people live more mindfully and better in their lives

1483
01:44:57,100 --> 01:44:59,820
With more love. Thank you for doing it. I appreciate you. Thank you, man

1484
01:45:00,060 --> 01:45:04,860
If you enjoyed that episode, you will love a selection of the best clips from the podcast over the last couple of months
