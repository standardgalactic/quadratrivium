0	5160	If we were to look at ourselves through the lens of an experiment like we would an animal experiment
5160	11380	We think that animal is sick if you saw an animal digging in the corner looking looking looking looking for a bone the dog
11380	17160	Is looking looking looking looking looking and you'd think that's really sad. That's us, right? That's us
17160	19160	I'm pointing it myself intentionally. That's us
21800	26840	Dr. Andrew Huberman welcome to the show great to be here. It's been a long time coming very long time coming
26880	30600	What do you mean when you say you cannot control the mind with the mind?
31320	37960	Yeah, that statement really emerges from the fact that if we are in a pretty relaxed state or
38360	40360	If we are happy
40400	45740	We generally feel like we can do what we want to do. We can maneuver through our environment
46080	48680	We can make choices that are reasonable
49120	56440	But oftentimes we're not in relaxed and happy states. That's just part of the human experience obviously and there's a
56920	58920	Fundamental feature to the nervous system
59240	62320	Which is this thing they call the autonomic nervous system
62320	68720	Which is just fancy nerd speak for the components of your nervous system that raise your levels of alertness or bring them
68720	74960	Way down sometimes we hear fight or flight rest and digest, but this system governs all that but a lot more and
76400	79480	basically what happens is when we are at the extremes of
80160	82880	the autonomic what I call seesaw of
83240	91320	Very very alert to the point of being really stressed or panicked or concerned or if we are very close to sleep and we're drowsy and we're exhausted
92080	93920	at those
93920	95920	points along the
96640	97640	autonomic
97640	99000	Nervous system
99000	103520	Our thoughts become a bit like a runaway train, you know if you're very upset
103960	108160	It's hard to talk yourself out of it if you're stressed. It's hard to think yourself out of it
108280	111680	In fact, you can start doing all sorts of third-personing and
112400	118840	Rationalization you can call someone you can text somebody. It's very hard to get yourself out of those states with thinking alone
119560	123080	But the beauty of the autonomic nervous system is that it
123760	128920	Traverses the brain and the body and it connects to essentially all the organs of the body
128920	133760	And it's a two-way street such that certain behaviors
134520	136520	Even certain patterns of breathing
137400	139400	Etc allow us to
140120	144160	Shift where we are on the autonomic continuum
144760	147440	between very very alert and stressed and very calm and
148280	155800	thereby give our mind a shift also in terms of the kinds of thoughts that we can entertain the sorts of
156120	161520	Actions that we can engage in to make this concrete if you're very very stressed. We're very very upset
162040	164720	Two things happen one. It's very hard to take your focus off
165000	170480	Whatever it is that's upsetting you and if you don't know what's upsetting you knew pure anxiety, but you don't know why
170480	173280	It's very hard to take your mind off of the feelings of anxiety
174840	176840	In those states of mind
177360	182440	There's another component which is that for whatever reason and no one really understands why this is
182440	185600	It feels as if the state that you're in will go on forever
186160	189640	Now when we're in happy relaxed states rarely do we think gosh?
189640	195080	This is going to go on forever and yet when we are in these unfortunate states of mind
195200	201060	We get the idea somehow it was sort of hijacks our perception of time and we feel like this is never going to stop
201760	204920	If we turn to the body and certain behaviors
205320	207320	Let me talk about what those are
207320	214200	We are able to move ourselves along the autonomic continuum and at that point when we've done that successfully
214360	216360	It's actually quite straightforward to do
216600	218800	We are able to think about things differently
219080	222120	We start to get a sense that the way we feel
222560	225480	might not be the way we're going to feel forever and
226240	229120	It's in those shifts that we start to realize ah
229680	234720	My mind actually is not my best friend at these extremes, but there's a lot more to it
234720	240560	You're only getting the tip of the iceberg in those states, so that's why I say if you can't control the mind with the mind
241000	243160	Look to the body to control the mind
243560	244880	How would that be adaptive?
244880	248840	How would it be adaptive for us to focus all of our attention on to the anxiety?
248840	254640	Is that something that you could see a useful? Absolutely, so let's take stress as an example
254640	256640	And this could be stress panic anxiety
256640	261360	You know each one of those has a definition in medical terms psychological terms, but to be fair
261680	267840	No one really knows how to draw the line in the brain between fear and stress and anxiety
268160	272920	But we can save with certainty that all of those states
273600	280920	involve high levels of alertness high levels of awareness sometimes for things in our environment and sometimes just for what's going on internally
281760	283760	When we are stressed anxious
284240	288120	Afraid waking up in the middle of the night doesn't matter what triggered it
288120	293520	There are a couple basic things that happen to all of us first of all our heart rate quickens. That's kind of an obvious one
294520	300760	Fuel from our muscles and our liver is shuttled to particular organs of the body and away from others
301280	306040	In particular fuel is shuttled towards the big muscles of the body to generate large movements
306040	312000	This is why we quake a bit when we're stressed the hands will shake it's preparing us for where you're prepared for movement
312000	313520	How does that prepare us for movement?
313520	318320	The shaking actually is the consequence of trying to not move when we are stressed
318400	322520	Basically, this is why taking a walk or a run you actually feel like you can kind of dispel the stress
322520	329000	You're not actually dispelling the stress. What's happened is it's like the ARP the RPM are getting cranked up. It's like idling it
330160	333640	Right, it's you know, you could sit there in a parked car and do that
333720	338640	But basically you take the thing out of park and it just wants to go and so a lot of the times when we're stressed
338640	341360	It's in conditions in which we're trying to remain still
341800	346000	Public speaking and a tough argument, you know at the doctor's office about to get an injection
346000	351120	You know, it depends on what stresses people obviously, but that readiness for action is a second component
351120	353520	It's a heart rate readiness for action by way of shuttling
354200	361120	glucose and other fuels to the muscles and then away from the reproductive organs from digestive organs, etc
361120	363120	Because that is just not the right time for that
364640	373760	Another very very powerful feature of this response is that our our pupils of our eyes the dark parts of our eyes get big
373920	376640	Now you might think that that expands your visual field
376640	381240	But actually the way the optics of the eye work that narrows the aperture of your visual field
381240	385040	So when you are stressed, you literally are seeing things through a small aperture
385320	387800	so distraught view of the world as they say and
388720	395760	Under those conditions, you cannot see things in your periphery as well as you could prior to being stressed
395960	398400	but you become exquisitely good at
399120	403840	Measuring small detail changes in whatever it is that you happen to be looking at now
403840	410280	There's an internal process too, which is that the aperture on your thinking also becomes very very narrow
410440	415800	So that if for instance, well, I had this happen the other day. I I heard something very stressful
415800	417800	I couldn't think about anything else
418040	422280	Right and that might just seem logical like of course you can't think about anything else very stressful
422280	426360	You're concerned about this, but my mind wasn't thinking about this particular incident
426360	432600	It was thinking if this then this then if that then that and that then that and so you start, you know dropping into the future
433040	436440	You start dropping into the past like why did we do that?
436440	439440	Wow, you know and you start doing all that kind of cycling through things
439800	444400	And of course there are so many things that can help relax us meditation
444880	448040	Exercise a nice healthy meal social connection
448120	452920	but the fifth column of the stress response is that
453520	457120	Your aperture of vision your aperture of thinking gets very narrow
457160	461640	And it becomes harder and harder to do the very things that would keep you out of stress
461640	465880	And so this is kind of the the double-edged sword that is stress
465880	472360	And so all the more reason why in those moments if the stress is not desired because there are moments when stress is desired
472360	474240	You know you're navigating an emergency, etc
474240	478440	But if you don't want to be in that narrow aperture of thinking and vision, etc
478600	484360	Then you need to find some way to bring your level of autonomic arousal as it's called down
485000	490800	Slightly so that you can start thinking about other possibilities or you know, there are instances
490800	495560	I think everyone's been in this kind of situation where the thing that's stressing out is not going to get resolved today
495560	500240	And you just sleep and of course you know you need to sleep and then you can't sleep
500240	502640	And then of course that creates a compounding stress
502640	506080	And now you're stressed about not being able to sleep and then over the course of the next few days
506080	511680	You you know dissolve into a puddle of tears, but fortunately there are ways out of that kind of self-destruction
512160	515160	You've done a lot of work on fear that was one of the things that you mentioned before
515160	518520	Is there something that everybody is scared of because I've heard the
519200	524240	Story the wives tale babies are born with is it fears of heights and loud noises or something
524240	527640	Is there any truth in that there is there something everyone's scared of there is I think the one that
528760	536360	Everybody who has a healthy nervous system will react quite robustly to is if you start increasing the amount of carbon dioxide
536880	541240	That they're breathing and reduce the amount of oxygen that they're taking in that's terrifying
541240	543240	Am I right in thinking there's a
543240	549240	Experiment you can do where it's a single breath and that is pretty reliable at bringing on an anxiety attack
549240	554040	Yeah, if you have people, please don't do this because you need the right proper medical staff around
554040	560800	But they're they're great experiments of having people breathe carbon dioxide directly and it you basically panic
561720	567520	It's terrifying one big gulp of carbon dioxide will make make you very afraid
567520	569680	It turns out that there are a little group of neurons
569680	576280	Of course neurons are just nerve cells that low group of neurons in the brain stem that respond to levels of carbon dioxide in the blood
576280	581080	It turns out the reason we breathe is of course to bring in oxygen and then off low carbon dioxide
581680	586720	But we don't have neurons that stimulate breathing for oxygen
586720	590000	We have neurons that sense when carbon dioxide levels get too high
590000	595840	So if you hold your breath, huh, eventually carbon dioxide levels go up and then at the moment that they reach a certain threshold
595840	598640	These neurons fire and trigger the gas brief flex
598640	603800	Oh, so in that moment you bring in oxygen and then of course you offload some carbon dioxide
604280	610880	That's why it's so important to work on co2 tolerance right for breath work. Yeah, so free divers a sport
610880	612400	I actually don't recommend
612400	616640	Because there's only one way out of that sport as they say I have some friends who are free drivers
616640	620280	And and obviously you can do it safely with the right guide and training etc
620280	627120	But it is a very dangerous sport because for most people when carbon dioxide levels increase in the bloodstream and brain
627360	629480	triggers this gas brief flex what
630320	633360	Free divers train is carbon dioxide tolerance
633520	639600	So they do that a couple of different ways and again, please don't do this because you actually people have died doing this
639600	642800	Which is so one way is you can do what's called cyclic hyperventilation
642960	650800	Right you do that 25 times or so and you think oh you're bringing a lot of oxygen you are but you're also
651000	658560	Offloading a lot of carbon dioxide, especially if you use forceful exhales normally humans breathe through active inhales and passive exhales
658640	661240	You just cut they just sort of dump their air passively
661560	666000	But if you do the cyclic hyperventilation you're dumping a lot of carbon dioxide and then if you were to
667480	670760	Hold your breath what you would find is you could hold your breath for a lot longer
670760	675920	Why because your carbon dioxide levels are reduced so you don't have the same impulse to breathe now on land
676240	681560	That's a more or less safe thing to do provided that you can get a good gulp of air once the gas reflex hits
682880	689560	If you do that before going under water cyclic hyperventilation they call air packing and then you go under water
690120	695880	You're going to be able to excuse me cyclic hyperventilation to air pack and then go under water
696680	698680	but your
699120	702680	Carbon dioxide is then lower you're going to be able to stay under longer
702920	707960	But this is very dangerous because normally when that carbon dioxide threshold hits you would
708280	713240	Pop up to the surface you sort of panic and want to go to the top free divers learn to tolerate
713640	719160	High levels of carbon dioxide in their bloodstream and stay very very calm the way they die is very interesting
719800	724960	Because it speaks to the physiology the way they they die is they'll just be swimming
725520	731040	Feeling completely calm because they're very used to they've trained up the co2 tolerance carbon dioxide tolerance
731280	736720	And when they die they don't suddenly feel like oh my goodness. I'm running out of air. It's just lights go black
736960	740400	That's it. They're just black out and so they're alive and then they're gone
740960	744640	And so this is why they use spotters. They you know, they have a line etc
745120	747120	anytime you hear about somebody
747200	750880	Dying doing free diving. It's rarely because they weren't
751760	756720	Comfortable at a given depth or because it's not because they're gas reflexes kicked in
756800	760640	It's because their gas reflex has been so desensitized that it's after the point of which they die
761120	763600	precisely and this you know, it's sort of like when you hear that
764800	771040	Skilled parachuters die why well because they're so comfortable with so many jumps. They actually forget to pull there's sometimes
771520	773600	there are many instances in which they're they're
774640	775920	videoing
775920	780560	The first time jumpers right and they're getting the video for them and they themselves forget to pull because they're so
780960	784240	Jumping out of planes and so as people get more and more advanced in something
784320	791120	There's a there's a new risk that that surfaces because unless it's very reflexive and they built all all the protocols in
791600	795120	Oftentimes they can overlook the very thing that allowed them to become expert in the first place
795600	800880	Why do my palms get sweaty when I watch videos of people climbing up cranes and stuff like that?
800960	805520	You know the ones that I mean the guy's got a gopro is a dude called james kinkston from the uk. That's a psychopath
805920	807920	He goes up to the highest
808000	809760	towers of dubai
809760	815520	Legally in the middle of the night and then I watch it on a screen. It's only this big and
816720	820960	I get this visceral response. Yeah, well two things first of all I I can relate
821120	825760	You know, I saw the free solo movie with alex honnold and you know, he lives
826400	829680	And it's still scary to watch right you actually know the outcome at the beginning
829760	832880	they sort of make it clear that he manages to do this and
833680	838240	You're it's still terrifying and I think it's for the same reason that the old youtube videos are terrifying
839760	843440	Which is that we are so visual as animals
843920	845920	We are so visual. I mean
846080	850480	rodents even a lot of carnivore predators are extremely olfactory smell driven
851280	859120	Humans are incredibly visual. I mean more than 40 percent of the human brain has something to do with vision visual navigation eye movements
859600	860720	um
860720	863360	Visual perception color perception face perception
863360	870000	We have dedicated areas of the brain that are just for perceiving human faces and the micro expressions of human faces
870160	872160	So it's so highly evolved for us
872880	875200	When we see depth of field
875760	877760	That's not um
877840	879760	parallel to the ground
879760	881760	It is terrifying with good reason because
882560	886640	You know, what's the universal force that we all experience from the time we're born is gravity
886880	890800	The first thing you learn is that things fall down not up, right?
891200	895760	They you know, it's it's like the the fundamental rule that we come into the world with it's like
896480	897520	Day one
897520	899520	Even though the baby's got flopping around like a potato
899520	901440	But can't even hold its head up the eyes are often
901520	903760	You know the ocular muscles of the eyes are often not very good
903760	907280	So babies it'll kind of their eyes are rolling back in their head that generally corrects itself
907840	909840	over the next few weeks or so
910080	916080	But the feeling of gravity of them, you know, if they feel like they're being dropped even the tiniest bit, right?
916320	920320	They will go wide eyed. So there's a built-in vestibulo ocular reflex
920800	925200	So when you see depth of field in the direction of the gravitational pull
925840	928320	You actually get a little bit of activity
928720	932400	In your cerebellum, which literally means mini brain a little area of the brain in the back
932480	937360	That actually looks like a little mini brain if you were looking at the brain and that area of the brain is responsible
937680	941520	For all the reflexes associated with the falling reflex. It does a lot of other things too
941840	944400	So when you see that depth of field in the direction of gravity
945440	948880	You have a little micro activity in your brain that you might fall
949360	953680	And if you've ever been to a tall bridge or a dam and you go to the edge and you know people love to play with this
953760	957680	There's that also that tower in toronto. They have the big um, see his tower
957840	963760	Well, the big no the big um the big tower and I forget what it is. Maybe it's in calgary. Goodness Canadians are gonna hate me
963840	966320	Okay, I love Canadians, but for some reason I can't remember this
966400	971520	They have one of those glass floors there where you can walk and it's terrifying and you know, you're not going to fall through it
971840	974880	Right or they tell you and you're not going to fall through it, but it's terrifying
975520	976880	because your
976960	981920	Body and brain are preparing for this immense fall. So when you see this in video, it's the same thing
982000	986800	I always say a picture is worth a thousand words, but a video is worth 10 million pictures
986880	993040	I mean, this is the reason why we're so drawn to things like instagram scrolling. It's like text text video
993760	996560	You know or the the enormous popularity of tiktok
997040	1003840	It's video now the enormous popularity of twitter still escapes me because that's a different different sort of cultural gravitational pull
1004320	1009360	But video and in particular action that gets us in a kind of a primitive mode
1010240	1012240	That is an extremely
1012320	1018560	Alluring visual image. What about emotional fears like a fear of failure or social disapproval or something
1018640	1023600	Do they work in a in a similar way or is there a different part of the brain that's using that? Yeah, great question
1023680	1028320	So um a few years ago a postdoc in my lab was now a staff scientist melise yeoman
1028640	1032560	Excuse me melise doctor melise yeoman's ball bunch has a long name
1033360	1035360	Excellent researcher studies fear
1036240	1041200	Did a very broad scale survey of the general public thousands and thousands of entries
1041840	1043280	Created this kind of
1043280	1047520	Cloud of bubbles the bigger the bubble the more the greater number of people that had that fear
1047840	1051920	You saw some we saw some interesting things. So heights certainly public speaking certainly
1052400	1054400	doctor's office and stringes certainly
1055120	1057280	public speaking fear is very common
1058320	1061680	Social isolation fear is very common, but we also saw some things like dogs
1062800	1064320	You know, there are a number of people who are afraid of dogs
1064320	1068160	Which is inconceivable to me because I love dogs exactly the same. Yeah, but people
1068880	1074160	You know people form these associations whether or not through experience or through indirect experience observing others
1074800	1077600	I think public speaking is one of the greatest fear of dying
1078160	1080160	Yeah, I swear. I don't it's not funny, but
1081040	1082640	figure of speech I
1082640	1087600	Never think about dying and being afraid of dying. I think about all the scary things that could happen while i'm living
1087920	1089920	but there are many people who are just
1090240	1092240	intrinsically afraid of dying
1092240	1094240	And so that's that's a big one
1095120	1099520	For people that uh, don't swim fear of drowning for people that swim less. So
1100960	1105360	For people that have some sort of psychiatric disorder genuine psychiatric disorder
1105760	1111600	Like obsessive compulsive disorder, which is not just per obsessive compulsive personality, but obsessive compulsive disorder
1112240	1116800	Fear of the of being discovered in the shame that they have around their obsessions and compulsions. These are
1117920	1120800	True ocd is very common. Do they all live in the same place?
1121680	1126080	All of these different fears that all exist. Yeah, so I was rattling off and I didn't answer your question
1126880	1128880	To the the more important point. So forgive me
1129920	1133200	The short answer is they have a final common pathway
1133680	1138880	Which is increased autonomic arousal and that is funneled through a couple what we call limbic structures
1139360	1143280	Among others. So there's certainly involvement of the of the now famous amygdala
1144080	1147360	This which means almond is this almond shape structure on the two sides of the brain
1147840	1154800	There's also area the brain called the striatum analysis is also involved in fear and then the hypothalamus this small collection
1155200	1157280	Of neurons just above the roof of your mouth
1157680	1161760	Which is really to me one of the more fascinating areas of the brain harbors neurons
1162160	1166160	That create a body wide and brain wide response
1166720	1171840	To something that the higher order areas of the brain like the forebrain
1172240	1177760	See and perceive as dangerous as threatening. So the short answer is yes
1177760	1184480	It all funnels through hypothalamus amygdala striaterminalis and autonomic nervous system. That's a final common pathway
1185200	1190320	But in terms of the variety of different things that can stimulate fear and the ways that they can do that
1190800	1192320	That is highly contextual
1192320	1198000	So the forebrain this real estate in the brain right behind behind the forehead is incredible because it's sort of
1198480	1204000	Free real estate for you to customize for your life according to what happens to you early on
1204320	1206800	So for instance, you might not be at all afraid of heights
1207760	1209760	And you say well, why is that so?
1209760	1213840	Well, maybe when you were a kid you were one of those maniacs that like, you know doing within the states
1213840	1218240	We call them cherry drops the kids that could you know swing on their feet and then jump off the the bar and
1218480	1222400	Then other kids are timidly crawling to the top of the thing don't even want to go up the ladder to the slide
1222800	1228160	There's a ton of variation and that variation does not exist in the kind of deeper circuitry the final common path circuitry
1228240	1233120	It exists in the learning that we experienced early in life one bad fall
1233840	1237760	Can do it. I mean, I was bitten very badly by a german shepherd when I was a kid
1238400	1243520	Head I almost got my eye, but you know for whatever reason I've always liked dogs anyway
1243920	1247680	But there are other things that I've experienced that have left long term negative imprints
1247920	1253840	So I it's highly contextual and a lot of it has to do with what happens immediately after the bad experience
1254080	1258080	This is why nowadays there's a lot of legal use of the drug ketamine
1258640	1261520	After traumas, you know, this is all very dark stuff, unfortunately
1261520	1265360	But if you you know, you just imagine the family member that was just in a car crash and saw their
1266000	1269280	The driver their loved one impaled onto the steering column
1269360	1273280	I mean what could be more horrible than that nowadays if they come into the emergency room
1273280	1280560	They will often give them an injection of ketamine, which is the dissociative anesthetic to get them to dissociate from this extreme emotional state
1281280	1283280	So there are ways now to treat this
1284000	1287520	And ketamine is used clinically at later periods, too
1287760	1290720	didn't you you you did an experiment where you went
1291840	1296720	Diving with sharks and I think that there was a complication and you went back the next day to redo it
1296720	1300560	I'm going to guess that this is for the exact same reason to sort of conquer and
1301520	1304880	Integrate the experience. Yeah to make a long story short
1304960	1309280	We went two years in a row out to Guadalupe Island where there are a lot of great white sharks
1309760	1314240	Some of the more expert shark divers were cage eggs sitting they were leaving the cage the first year
1314240	1316240	I did not the second year
1316240	1318800	I decided I would but the day before I did
1319280	1323760	I went down into the cage just get comfortable again down there and I had an air failure
1324160	1329520	And the safety tanks were out also and obviously I experienced extreme carbon dioxide
1330000	1335440	Overload and panic. I didn't full-blown panic. I kept enough awareness that I was able to obviously I'm here
1336000	1340480	Um, I survived doing a share air protocol, etc. But it was a very bad situation
1340720	1344080	I don't like to say I nearly died because that's actually sort of letting the bug in my brain
1344080	1350800	I like to joke that the reaper came in and um, you know and offered me a fist bump and I offered him a different gesture instead
1351360	1353360	so I survived
1353600	1358480	But the next day I woke up very very distraught because I had this bug in this loop in my brain
1358640	1364480	I you know this notion I came so close to to the end and so I did go back down and I did cage exit
1364720	1366720	and I don't say that to
1367120	1369120	Suggest that it was the smartest decision
1370240	1372240	Obviously you're safer on the boat or on land
1372880	1378720	I don't say it to sound, you know, again tough or anything. I did it deliberately because I did not want to return
1379760	1381760	home with this
1381840	1389680	Loop of fear and so I went back into the traumatic circumstance and obviously made it out and if you look at all the successful treatments
1390240	1392240	for trauma they all involve
1393040	1395040	getting close to the
1395920	1397920	trauma inducing mindset
1398480	1403360	exposure therapy gradual and assisted by a clinician, but rarely if ever
1404400	1410400	Are people with serious trauma encouraged to get as far away from the feeling of at least not in the clinical setting
1410560	1412960	This has a lot of implications for things like trigger warnings
1413760	1417920	Colleagues of mine in psychiatry. I've asked them directly. What do you think of trigger warnings? And they said, you know
1418160	1421040	I mean, there's some logic to it on the on the surface, but if you really
1421600	1423600	think about true trauma
1423600	1425600	And we can define trauma
1425600	1430000	Dr. Paul Conti was on my podcast his amazing trauma psychiatrists. He said trauma is an experience
1430800	1437120	It's not just a bad experience trauma is an experience that changes your nervous system such that it behaves differently in the future
1437360	1443440	That in a way that's maladaptive for you. So if you look at all the trauma treatments, they're all about learning to talk about the trauma
1444160	1449680	Even experiencing some of the same feelings. So things like trigger warnings and all these things that buffer us against
1450080	1452080	Feeling our true feelings
1452080	1455840	Do nothing but prolong the trauma and prolong and exacerbate fear
1456560	1462160	You had David Goggins in the lab to study him for fear. What did you learn from looking at that guy?
1462880	1469360	David's David's great. I always chuckle with David because you know, the one thing about David is what you see on social media
1469520	1472720	Is actually what you get when you interact with David
1472800	1477440	We worked long hours one day and I was everyone was ready to tap out. This is a bunch of people in
1478000	1483920	Silicon Valley for a day, you know doing some workshop type thing and he just he was changing into his running shorts
1483920	1488240	Midway he was going to run to the airport and he ran to the airport as far as I know to get his flight
1488320	1490320	I believe so, you know
1490640	1494880	But there was this moment of should we continue? Should we take a break and he was like, no, let's keep going keep going
1495920	1500720	Everything you see and read and hear about David is exactly how he shows up. It's really wonderful
1501440	1506160	He came to the lab and he did, you know, we have a virtual version of the shark thing
1506640	1511280	Um, which of course is not the same. It's the real experience, but for people who are afraid of sharks
1511520	1514160	It's quite scary for them and allows us to study fear
1514480	1517200	David was he's very afraid of sharks, which was sort of
1517680	1519120	amusing to me given that
1519120	1521280	As a seal he had to spend a lot of time in water
1521680	1528080	But uh, he was first one in wanted to do the vr talked about how he didn't like it. But um, but that's why he did it
1528320	1530080	You know constant
1530080	1533280	Testing himself. In fact, I think even though David's quite successful
1533440	1536080	I think and has many many options of how to spend his time
1536640	1539600	I believe this is correct that I think right now. He's doing fire jumping
1539600	1544640	He's fighting fires in the wilderness by ziplining in or fast lining in or jumping out of planes
1544880	1546960	So he's constantly pushing that
1547680	1550320	That friction lever to create
1551520	1556320	Or build or further build this thing about leaning into friction
1556320	1558320	And this is a term that isn't really scientific
1558800	1562080	But that I decided to coin because this idea of limbic friction
1562560	1566880	That when we're very tired and we need to be in action or when we're very stressed and we need to
1567840	1570000	Perform in a more calm and controlled way
1570480	1574000	There's friction on both sides getting out of bed when we're exhausted hard
1574720	1576160	Very hard often
1576160	1579840	Leaning into action in a calm and deliberate way when we're freaking out
1580080	1583040	Like going to give a public lecture if one has fear of public speaking
1583440	1586560	Also hard so this limbic friction and david just seems to seek
1586960	1589440	What I call limbic friction in every domain of life
1589600	1592160	Is that like exposure therapy for limbic friction then?
1592720	1593520	Essentially, yeah
1593600	1598320	I mean what you're training and improving when you're getting better at dealing with stress
1598800	1605200	Is this ability to tolerate high amounts of adrenaline in your body and to think clearly and function well
1605440	1608720	I mean adrenaline is epinephrine and just a little bit of physiology
1608800	1613680	It's released from the adrenals obviously above the kidneys that gets your body organs
1614560	1616560	Amped up and energized
1616880	1619120	It can't cross the so-called blood brain barrier
1619200	1622240	You have a high restriction fence that we call the blood brain barrier around the brain
1622960	1624960	Keep bad molecules out
1625120	1631120	Adrenaline therefore is released also within the brain from a little cluster of neurons called locus ceruleus. The name doesn't matter
1631520	1633520	So when you are stressed
1633920	1637440	Your brain and your body both wake up and that adrenaline
1638560	1644800	Hijack certain systems narrows your visual focus, etc. Etc. If you look at almost all stress inoculation
1645760	1646800	protocols
1646800	1648800	Cold water ice bath cold shower
1649440	1651440	cyclic hyperventilation
1651840	1653840	Those all do the same thing
1653840	1657600	They generate a lot of adrenaline release in the brain and a lot of adrenaline release in the body
1658240	1664640	But it's different if those if the adrenaline in the brain and body is evoked by you that you did it
1664960	1670400	Because under conditions under which you did the ice bath deliberately and now you're wide awake and really really alert
1671040	1672560	There's this feeling that you have options
1672560	1677280	It wasn't done to you, but you can train up an ability to for instance think
1677920	1679920	Clearly and calmly
1679920	1685520	Maybe even do some simple math problems in your head or maybe try and relax while there's all this adrenaline
1685840	1690960	In your system and that carries over so that when you you know, we've all done it
1691040	1693440	You're driving along the person in front of you stop short
1694000	1698720	And you're almost in the accident, right? There's that moment where you could panic or that moment where you could
1699200	1702480	You know road rage or that moment where you could freak out
1702880	1709520	But if you are familiar with the feeling of adrenaline in your brain and body you navigate that in a in a calmer way
1709600	1715760	How well because adrenaline is generic. There's no adrenaline for the car crash adrenaline for the heights adrenaline for the
1716320	1721440	The uh the relationship situation. It's all the same so we can get better
1721440	1727040	We can raise our stress threshold as I like to refer to it and that can be done through cold water
1727280	1729280	Or cyclic hyperventilation
1729280	1731680	Ideally not at the same time, but cold water
1732160	1739040	You know is a universal stimulus for creating adrenaline release and there's a big range of cold not infinite but a big range of cold
1740000	1741840	In which you can generate
1741840	1748560	Adrenaline without harming your tissue whereas with heat you get into a very hot environment or very low oxygen environment
1748720	1752000	You'll also get a lot of adrenaline, but you can also suffocate and burn yourself
1752000	1754960	So this is why cold is used in navy seal screening and training
1755200	1758800	And this is why I think so many people really like the ice bath and cold showers
1758880	1763520	It has a bunch of other positive effects, but it is a great trigger for adrenaline
1764320	1767040	speaking about relationships one of the most
1767920	1772800	Uh common traumas probably that people are going to go through is heartbreak, right?
1772880	1779600	You're going to be in a relationship that you imagine is going to continue forever. Maybe when you're 18 or sometimes when you're 48
1780240	1786640	And then it's going to stop. Have you thought about the neuroscience of what's happening during heartbreak?
1787280	1790240	Now we did so i've done episodes of our podcast on
1790800	1792800	love attachment and relationships
1793360	1797840	Which is a fascinating literature mostly from psychology, but also by biological literature
1799040	1805600	And that's mostly about people's orientation toward attachment. So they're just very quickly
1806560	1812880	There's the so-called secure attached style. This typically emerges in childhood when there's a very predictable care
1814000	1815440	caregiver carry
1815440	1820560	A relationship between child and most often mother, but it can be father to or other caregiver
1820800	1825840	Just so happens that the classic experiments were done on mothers because this was in the 1970s and there weren't as many
1826560	1831840	Reverse role really, you know homes, etc. There were some but not as many as there are now. So
1832800	1835920	That's one style of attachment the parent leaves the child gets a little distraught
1835920	1842400	But then can distract itself doing other things or just simply do other things because they have a high degree of intrinsic knowledge
1842640	1844640	Not the thought but intrinsic
1844640	1849280	Calm the autonomic nervous system doesn't feel any need to ramp up because the mom returns
1849600	1852800	Then there's the so-called insecure attachment styles and there are a bunch of different ones
1853040	1857840	But those are the ones where it's really stressful when the parent leaves. It's not clear. They're going to come back
1857920	1862480	And when they come back, it's not clear that there's they're going to reestablish the bond the child will feel
1863200	1864720	Supported, etc
1864720	1867280	Here's what's fascinating those same neural circuits
1868000	1873040	Are repurposed for romantic attachment in adult life the same circuits, which shouldn't surprise us
1873040	1875280	I mean, why would the brain throw away valuable circuitry?
1875440	1880960	But this whole Freudian notion that you know childhood attachment styles map onto adult attachment styles
1881520	1883520	That's real. That's physiological
1883840	1885680	Now one important point
1885680	1890400	It's not one for one in the sense that let's say you had a secure attachment to your father
1890880	1894640	Let's say it's a young a young girl and as a baby and a young child
1894640	1897840	She had a secure attachment to her father and an insecure attachment to her mother
1898640	1904080	In adulthood and let's say she's heterosexual. So in adulthood she prefers men as romantic partners
1904320	1907920	This girl grows up and you might say well, she had a good relationship to her dad
1907920	1912640	So she's going to have a good secure attachment style in her adult heterosexual relationships
1913600	1914960	Often it's not the case
1914960	1921120	They will transplant or superimpose the insecure attachment style to the to the mother on to male
1921680	1922000	relationships
1922000	1924720	But have great relationships to female friends, for instance
1925040	1928320	So we have to be a little careful to not map one for one. That's important
1928640	1930400	So all of that is in us
1930400	1932800	And then you were talking about breakups and we did an episode on grief
1932800	1936080	And the way that grief works in the brain and nervous system is that there are three
1936720	1940720	Sort of factors that are mapped in our consciousness and our subconscious
1941120	1943120	And these are space
1943280	1947360	Time and this notion of closeness, which is attachment space and time is very simple
1947600	1951360	It's where is the person that I love and when will I see them next?
1951840	1952160	Right?
1952160	1954800	I mean if you have a relative that lives overseas and you know, they're alive
1954880	1956800	You're not going to grieve them. You might really miss them
1956800	1959760	But you're not going to grieve them the same way you would if suddenly you get the note
1960560	1962560	Unfortunately that they passed away
1963040	1968320	And then attachment is how close you are to them like how critically you rely on them for
1969040	1973280	Internal control and support and that doesn't mean they have to be an immediate caregiver
1973280	1977200	It could just be like a really good friend. You call them mates over in the UK
1977200	1980000	Right? Like a really good friend that just your knowledge of him
1980560	1982880	Just makes you feel good. You feel better in the world
1982880	1986720	You know as a guy who mostly grew up with kind of a big pack of male friends
1987120	1993760	I mean I feel strongest and happiest and most secure in life when I see something about one of my friends doing well in life
1993760	1998800	It just makes me feel good if one of them dies and unfortunately I'm getting to the age where a number of them have died
1999600	2001600	then
2001600	2005680	You feel like all of a sudden like goodness like there's a loss internally, right?
2006080	2008000	Okay, that's all sort of obvious
2008080	2011200	But what's interesting is that the grief process itself
2011840	2017680	Is about restructuring this map this map think of it like a tripod. It's got three pieces space time and closeness
2018000	2020000	When someone dies
2020000	2026560	It's very confusing for the brain because where are they in space? Well, the body is put someplace. Maybe it's cremated. Maybe it's not
2027120	2031120	We have notions of a spirit and that depends on one's orientation a soul or a spirit
2031280	2036560	Okay, or if you don't then you don't then where do they go, right? And then time when will you see them again?
2037360	2039440	There's the never you'll never see them again
2039840	2045600	And the closeness component remains and so there's an untethering of this map and so there's been brain imaging studies
2046240	2048240	um beautiful work by
2048320	2050320	Mary Frances O'Connor University of Arizona
2050720	2056800	showing that if you look in the brain and people that are in grief from loss of a really strong attachment the state
2057200	2061120	Of brain and body that gets flipped on is a motivational state
2061920	2063040	it's
2063040	2067840	Exactly the same circuitry in the brain that one sees active if someone very hungry
2068160	2074000	Is put just outside the wall of some delicious food or if an animal that really wants to mate
2074880	2077360	I guess mate with animals you call it copulate
2077360	2083360	They really want to copulate with another animal is put just beyond the wall of that animal, but they can smell them
2083600	2085600	I mean these are highly motivated
2085600	2092560	Desiring states so grief is a motivated state to to bridge the distance in time and space and yet it's impossible
2093040	2096720	And so the process of grief is a gradual waning of that motivation
2097440	2100880	And a gradual shift of the memory of the person into some
2101360	2105360	Concept whether or not it's a soul whether or not it's just the past whether or not it's their energy
2105360	2109200	You know again, it depends on what the forebrain of that particular person believes
2109840	2115920	Shifts that concept of that person into a place where the brain is comfortable. There's no more autonomic arousal
2115920	2117280	There's no motivation
2117280	2119280	And we've all experienced this if you've had a loss
2119760	2123760	And I've had a loss for instance where my graduate advisor died and I adored her
2124080	2126080	And every once in a while her daughter will call me
2126640	2132160	From her cell phone and she kept the same number on that phone and the name and every once in a while a ring
2132720	2136560	Barber Chapman and I'll reach for the phone and then there's this moment when I'm like, oh goodness
2136800	2139440	So anyway, I'm going on and on just to color this with example, but
2140240	2141920	When there's a breakup
2141920	2147280	It's exceedingly hard, especially if the person is young, you know, if you look at suicides after breakups
2147280	2150320	Those are far more common in younger people than they are in older people
2150400	2153600	Why because the relationship represents the whole future
2153680	2158720	They have no concept that they're they know there are other people, but it sort of feels like the whole world is shutting down
2159360	2160800	so
2160800	2162160	in
2162160	2166320	Breakups what's happened is the person is no longer available in time and space
2166640	2169920	This is why when someone breaks up you literally have to let them go, right?
2170000	2175120	You know constant pursuing of them is the out of context is not healthy. They have a name for that. It's called a stalker
2175840	2177680	Don't do it
2177680	2179680	But it's almost as if you have to
2180080	2184000	The brain has to think that the person is gone in time and space
2184240	2186880	And this has become much harder with social media, right?
2186880	2190560	Because people can check up on people they can hear from people in the old days like when I was growing up
2190640	2194720	You just like took the phone off the hook or you you diverted your attention
2195280	2197840	Now we are constantly renewing that the person is still there
2197920	2201840	And so love and the loss of love and the death grief are
2202480	2207040	Virtually identical. It's that motivational stain. This is why it's so hard to not reach out to somebody that you really
2207440	2208800	miss and want back
2208800	2210800	I saw a study last week that
2211280	2215360	Had researchers asking participants to rate emotional and physical pain of a breakup
2215680	2219120	They found that women tend to be more negatively affected by breakups
2219440	2222480	Reporting high levels of both physical and emotional pain
2222800	2226240	But while breakups hit women the hardest they tended to recover more fully
2226800	2231680	Men on the other hand rarely fully recovered. I thought that was very interesting. I wasn't too sure what that meant
2231920	2236320	Yeah, it's interesting. Um, it also rings true with my my experience and my observations
2236400	2240880	It I think I mean this could relate to a number of things and here I'm painting with a broad brush, right?
2241280	2243680	But um, you know, how comfortable one is
2244240	2250320	Feeling their feelings is male or female is going to strongly dictate how quickly one moves through grief
2250400	2252400	This is the same thing as trauma
2252400	2258800	The more willing someone is to feel the full depth and intensity of the feelings that they associate with that trauma
2259120	2261120	The more quickly they're going to move through
2261360	2264800	The trauma, uh, again, I'm lifting from paul conti's words. So these aren't mine
2264800	2268080	But you know people use a number of strategies. They use distraction
2268640	2271840	They use states like they sublimate to things like anger
2272400	2273040	um
2273040	2279200	And avoidance of various kinds in order to not feel the traumatic feelings or not feel the breakup people, you know
2279760	2285600	Try and self-soothe the alcohol or try and self-soothe with multiple new partners or whatever it happens to be doesn't work
2286160	2291280	Just extends it because this map of space time and closeness needs to be fractured
2291280	2295440	And the only way to do that is for the brain to have to confront the reality
2295760	2297120	Which is that
2297120	2302800	Whether by death or by by breakup, they are no longer available. It's like the food on the other side of that wall
2303520	2305520	Is gone. It's just not there anymore
2306480	2310960	Or that the food that was accessible now there's a wall in between and you will not get through it
2311200	2314000	And you know, you can see this actually in animal studies that are kind of
2314560	2317200	Hard, they're actually very hard to watch you'll see the animal perseverate
2317280	2320480	Literally damage its own body trying to get through a barrier to something
2320480	2325440	It's highly motivated to see people do that post breakup. They usually do that by talking to everybody about the breakup
2325840	2330400	Um, which is its own form of perseverating on the motivation. What did I do?
2330560	2334960	What did I do wrong this and that and some of that analysis is healthy some of it's not now why
2335600	2337360	would one group
2337360	2338720	be
2338720	2341920	More of let's just say effective at dealing with breakups
2342080	2348640	It's probably the ability to really feel the full intensity of how sad it is and be able to confront that and here
2348800	2354560	I'm you know, I'm a male. I've only ever lived in a male body. So all I can tell you is that I think from a very early age
2355040	2359680	Um, there's a an ability that at least I'm sure it transcends to women too
2360240	2363680	Or extends to women too, but learning to pack down feelings, right?
2363920	2367520	And so when are we really talking about when we're talking about pack down feelings? I'm not a psychologist
2367520	2371440	But what we learn is top down control for brain to autonomic control
2371440	2376240	It's the same thing like I don't want to jump off the high dive or I don't want to do this public speaking
2376240	2380800	But I'm gonna I'm gonna kind of like I'm just gonna force myself. I'm gonna David Goggins it, right
2381520	2383920	grief is a is an autonomic state
2384480	2386960	Uh, we say it has valence has negative valence
2387440	2389440	But it's high levels of autonomic arousal
2389840	2395120	With a negative connotation because you can be high levels of autonomic arousal with happiness, right?
2395120	2398320	You can be very alert and aroused and happy very alert and arous and sad
2398640	2400640	It's very alert and arous and sad
2401120	2402480	and yet
2402480	2406320	We learn how to tamp that down. What is tamping down? It's
2407120	2409120	reducing our heart rate. It's
2409520	2412640	Going to work each day being a functional human being, you know, there's a lot of that
2413440	2414560	rather than
2414560	2417600	Allowing ourselves to you know sob uncontrollably into a pillow
2418400	2423200	Some people are better at this. I mean the late steve jobs was a big proponent of scream therapies
2423280	2429040	He used to go up into the hills behind stanford. He actually owns up still owns a property back there. He was really into
2430400	2436880	You know catharsis cathartic release of internal state that he felt would allow him to like return as a happier nicer person
2436880	2442000	He was also kind of well known for screaming at people in the office. So he obviously had a lot pent up inside
2442560	2444560	um, so I think
2444640	2446640	The better that we can lean into
2448000	2451360	The emotional states that we fear the most but in a controlled
2452000	2454960	Way where we're not harming ourselves or other people the better
2455360	2460480	The more that we try and avoid that and we try and sublimate or just you know, and I've done this
2460480	2461520	So I'm speaking from experience
2461520	2461920	You know
2461920	2468320	I would use the anger or the sadness from an experience to just work 10 10 times longer 10 times harder
2468640	2470000	To just get that much more focused
2470000	2475600	You're taking that autonomic arousal that narrow aperture and that energy and you're putting it onto something that moves your life forward
2476000	2478720	So in some cases that's good because you still need to function
2479120	2480960	And give but it can give you the
2480960	2487520	Here I'll just say it gave me the illusion that I was working through something because you get all the accoutrements and rewards of hard
2487520	2488240	Work
2488240	2491120	But what you don't do is remap that spacetime
2491840	2494320	closeness map and then you find I guarantee
2494880	2496880	You find yourself five or ten years later
2497200	2501520	Wondering why you're so exhausted or why certain things in life aren't going well
2501520	2504480	And it's because when they say you haven't dealt with the loss
2504880	2507520	You never actually allowed yourself to feel the feelings
2507680	2509680	But once you do
2509680	2515360	It's like a valve. It releases you hear musicians say that the most recent album was shit
2515520	2520240	Because I didn't have any heartbreak to work through right and it is strange how people
2521840	2526720	It's a difficult thing to pass because a little bit of it is kind of like alchemy right a little bit of it
2526800	2531520	Is kind of like turning something that's terrible into something that's useful and beautiful. It's fuel
2532480	2533440	but
2533440	2535520	You're right. It is a it's a
2536160	2540320	Hiding away from what it is that you actually need to do from the work that you need to do
2540880	2542880	And in a world which is a meritocracy
2543200	2547760	Where people want success and status and accolade and fame and you go well
2548960	2550960	enemies and
2551440	2553440	revenge and bitterness
2553520	2554960	resentment
2554960	2557360	Pretty good motivators. Maybe I could use some of that
2557520	2562720	Maybe I should go out of my way to try and put myself into positions where this motivates me and working out
2563280	2566000	Where that falls on the ledger is is a difficult one
2566240	2570160	It is and I think it depends on life stage and it depends on how one is going to work it out
2570240	2572560	I mean the the narrative around the shark dive
2572640	2574320	I mean even as I say it now
2574320	2577280	So that was 2017 was the second dive when I think about all that
2577520	2578640	I think like that was crazy
2578640	2582160	I was out there studying fear and I almost was the professor who died studying fear
2582240	2586320	It would have been a terrible end to the story. Um, what was I doing? Don't do this don't do this
2586400	2591120	But you know, there are times in our life where we feel compelled to take on certain challenges for whatever reason
2591760	2595520	There's a phrase it doesn't exist in the scientific literature, but it captures two
2596160	2601280	Um components of physiology that are absolutely factual earlier. We talked about limbic friction
2601920	2606880	As it relates to creative process and sublimation of anger and sadness and creating things from bad
2607440	2609440	Events books music, etc
2610080	2615200	Um the the words that come to mind are limbic resonance the human beings
2616160	2621440	Resonate with these extreme states, you know, there aren't many great albums written about
2622320	2625840	A good day walking on a sunday in the park like it's kind of boring
2625840	2629120	I mean, there's the the beautiful painting sunday in the park with george, but I'll be honest
2629120	2632400	It's beautiful, but it's also kind of boring you can look at the details of it for a while
2632800	2639360	People like intensity the scream is it, you know, people look at that for a long time and speaks to the psychosis of the artist, etc
2640240	2644800	You know, people don't generally bond through passive relaxed states
2645200	2650080	Unless they've also been through a lot together, right? I mean you even think about uh, the
2650480	2651920	We could talk about this separately if you want
2651920	2656720	But all of us are here because of the autonomic seesawing that is the reproductive act
2656960	2662640	It goes from highly around how you refer to it in your lab. You know scientists autonomic seesawing
2662640	2667120	It is it's very interesting that the arousal process is one of increase in autonomic arousal
2667840	2671840	In order to get true arousal, but then not so much that it inhibits arousal
2672240	2678800	Then mating behavior and then the the orgasm response in males and females is highly what we call sympathetic not emotionally some
2678800	2682560	It can be I suppose emotionally sympathetic, but from a pure physiology standpoint
2683040	2686240	It's a activation hyper activation of the stress system
2686960	2688960	Even though it has positive valence
2688960	2693360	And then there's a very quick rebound to the so-called parasympathetic
2693840	2699680	Arm of the autonomic nervous system this deep relaxation, which we don't really know why I wasn't consulted the design phase
2699680	2703840	but we think that that postcoital bliss and is and the
2704240	2709600	Kind of relaxing the desire to not run around a bunch more for most people was to exchange
2710080	2712400	odorant molecules to increase pair bonding
2712880	2717040	And even if people aren't trying to pair bond because people don't always just mate to reproduce
2717840	2719920	but that uh
2719920	2724000	Some of the molecules that are released in each of the two individuals oxytocin being the main one
2724560	2728880	Give people a sense of kind of postcoital bliss and and it's a very calm one
2729200	2732960	That creates opportunity for bonding and discussion that is all like pillow talk
2732960	2735040	There are other forms of pillow talk postnut clarity
2735440	2736240	Andrew
2736240	2739600	But for women it might be something different right of course a different different name
2739760	2743600	I only speak in the language of physiology, but for both men and women this happens
2743680	2746000	It creates this little orb of closeness that is both
2746560	2748880	physiological and but neurochemical too
2749200	2752960	So what we can say for sure is that whether or not it was in vivo or in a dish
2753040	2755280	We are all here because two parents
2756080	2761440	Right a male and a female unless you're a condor where two females can produce a baby
2761440	2764560	This has now been shown right but as far as we know
2765040	2769760	Where a male and a female reproduce because they each went through this arc of arousal
2770560	2776400	Not too high arousal extreme stress relaxation that happened separately or together because in vitro it could be
2777040	2783360	Fertilization to be separate so the test of whether or not we get to reproduce is actually the ability to to
2784560	2788800	Assuming that people are doing this together and not through in vitro fertilization
2789280	2794800	Is a test of whether or not people can coordinate their autonomic nervous systems now there are ways around that and to override it
2794800	2796160	But by and large
2796160	2800240	That's the way humans evolved and the way all other animals evolved
2800880	2802880	Now limbic resonance
2802880	2805920	Is a good way I think to describe that process
2806000	2812000	But that carries over to other things too an album about an extreme loss a song or a poem about extreme loss
2812560	2818000	Brings the reader the listener into a limbic state that's very similar or approximates what
2818960	2820400	The creator
2820400	2822880	Experienced right the person created that art or that
2823520	2827360	Poetry and in the same way if something is about a lot of anger, you know
2827360	2833040	If you like loud fast music or something like that it's an extreme state. It has a gravitational pull to it
2833520	2836560	There's again. I'm using this language limbic resonance
2837120	2843840	Rarely if ever do human beings bond through nothing they bond through shared experience and you think of what makes people feel close
2844400	2847840	Well, there are a couple things and this has everything to do with time perception
2847920	2850960	typically when there's a high degree of limbic resonance it means that
2851520	2856880	The molecule's dopamine was increased substantially over baseline at some point
2857360	2861840	Dopamine is almost always discussed in terms of pleasure, but it's the molecule of motivation drive
2862560	2867840	And to some extent reward it tends to narrow our visual focus and believe it or not dopamine is the molecule from which
2868160	2870160	Adrenaline is manufactured
2870720	2873600	Biochemically you get adrenaline from dopamine
2874240	2879280	So these two act as close cousins to put us into these states of motivation and have energy to pursue things
2881040	2883040	When dopamine
2883040	2885040	Is very present in our system
2885280	2888960	Or if you're in the company of someone else and there's a lot of dopamine two things happen
2889200	2892240	First of all, you're very motivated narrowing a focus. That's one
2892480	2896400	The other is that the way that you perceive time is quite a bit different
2897040	2900320	For instance, if you ever had an amazingly exciting day
2900800	2903600	Just tons of things. Maybe you meet someone new. You're having the best time
2903600	2909280	I mean just think falling in love and the most incredible date that you can imagine how it begins and how it ends
2909280	2912880	It just feels incredible. It all feels like it went by very very fast
2913440	2917600	And yet when you look back on that day, it seems like so much happened
2918000	2920000	Now think about a opposite situation
2920480	2923200	You go to the doctor's office and you're sitting in the doctor's
2923680	2929600	Lobby and you're waiting and you're waiting and there's no phone reception. So you can't scroll instagram. You're waiting and you're waiting
2929840	2932320	It's incredibly boring. It's a very low dopamine state
2932720	2934960	It feels like it goes on forever
2935440	2937920	And yet when you look back nothing really happened
2938320	2943120	So dopamine changes our perception of time and in terms of developing human bonds
2943760	2948800	This has been well established that if two people for instance go three different places in a given day
2949280	2954480	They tend to feel like they know each other far better than if they stayed in one place even for a longer period of time
2954560	2960080	Did you know that pickup artists were weaponizing this about 15 years ago? No, it doesn't surprise me
2960080	2961280	But i'm sorry to hear it
2961280	2966640	It was common held wisdom in the pickup artist community that you were supposed to have a three location date
2966880	2972640	To manipulate precisely this to make the girl feel like you had progressed further down the
2973280	2977520	Maturation process of of spending time together. Surely there have to be female pickup artists, too
2977840	2980800	Uh, yeah, I feel like their job's probably easier
2981920	2983920	I can't comment
2983920	2987040	I don't know. I've never been one going back to dopamine
2987600	2992240	How just how triggering are our phones when it comes to dopamine? Okay, great question
2992960	2994960	We often hear that
2995120	2998400	You know the social media getting dopamine hit after dopamine hit
2999280	3001360	When we first get on social media after
3002160	3007520	For the first time or after a long period of time the amount of dopamine that's released we think is quite substantial
3007760	3013920	It's novel. Remember dopamine is about novelty surprise and the sense that we are on some exciting track
3014240	3019520	That's what dopamine is really about it puts us into states of readiness anticipation looking seeking, etc
3020000	3022560	Almost always for things outside the confines of our skin
3023200	3026320	Just to contrast it maybe for a bit more of a future discussion
3027280	3030720	Serotonin does the opposite when there's a lot of serotonin in our brain and body
3030960	3035520	Typically it makes us feel satisfied sated and more quiescent comfortable with what we have in our own
3036080	3041520	Immediate sphere and within us right the comfort of a good meal the food you have dopamine is about go go go
3041680	3044560	If you look at somebody who's high on cocaine or methamphetamine
3044720	3048000	It's all about pursuit because that's a very dopaminergic drug
3048000	3051600	You look at somebody who's taking a drug and i'm not suggesting people do this
3051600	3057120	But it really ramps up serotonin. Let's say a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor prosaxol off, etc
3057760	3062800	The side effects of those drugs if the dosages are too high lack of appetite lack of libido
3063360	3069200	Kind of meh about life, you know, then so they'll adjust the dose down. That's because those are serotonergic drugs
3069760	3070960	so
3070960	3072960	in in general
3072960	3077040	When we are in pursuit of things dopamine is is quite high
3077600	3078720	so
3078720	3081600	Now you have to remind me your question because i've set up the dopamine serotonin
3082160	3084160	cell phones. Ah cell phones. Yes
3084720	3086720	forgive me, so
3086800	3088960	The thing about cell phones is when you first get on there
3089520	3093600	And you have let's say your no wi-fi on the flight or something and you land
3093920	3098080	It can actually be quite stimulating you get a lot of dopamine. Oh, there's this. Oh, there's that
3098320	3102000	But very quickly when you're scrolling on social media
3102720	3105600	You're no longer getting the novelty, but you're continuing to do it
3105600	3107760	You almost don't know why you're doing it at that point
3107840	3112000	It shifts over to something that's a bit more like an obsessive compulsive behavior
3112480	3117520	Where that we can define an obsessive compulsive behavior where the obsession leads to a compulsion
3117520	3119760	So the obsession is a thought the compulsion is a behavior
3120160	3124720	But the acting out of the compulsion merely serves to increase the obsession
3125360	3130320	Right, this is very different than being obsessed with food or obsessed with cleanliness. There's no payoff, right?
3130320	3135440	Exactly. There's no anxiety relief by carrying out the compulsion with OCD behaviors
3136320	3142320	Like scrolling social media the dopamine quickly wanes and then you find that you're just sort and we've all been there
3142400	3147600	You're scrolling like why am I doing this? This isn't that interesting that is this isn't that interesting now
3148320	3151440	The algorithms for social media are very clever and I don't want to demonize it
3151440	3155760	I you know provide a lot of a lot my life has spent on you know in social media now, but
3155920	3162080	In the algorithms that they've incorporated function on the the most powerful
3163120	3167920	way to keep people doing a behavior or an animal for that matter is intermittent
3168560	3172640	Random reward a random intermittent reward that you don't know when you're going to hit the jackpot
3172640	3177760	So you're scrolling you're scrolling and then you see something typically it's very high what you know in nerd speak
3177760	3179200	We'd say signal to noise
3179200	3184640	So if you're reading some interesting things this came out in the news this came out and then it's all of a sudden a riot
3185200	3189600	or a person that is jump is based jumping off a building or
3190400	3194240	You know for people that are are scrolling looking at bodies or something like that
3194640	3197200	Live bodies that hopefully people aren't looking at dead bodies
3197200	3200960	But look if something's very tragic then that has this gravitational pull
3201520	3203840	And then you what happens is you start getting
3204560	3208560	The system working for that next dopamine hit that you don't know when it's going to come
3208560	3209840	It's just like gambling
3209840	3216240	So I look at social media as initially being very dopaminergic driving rewards surprise and excitement
3216560	3219040	But very quickly transitioning to something more like ocd
3219680	3223920	And the kinds of behaviors where it looks if you if we were to look at ourselves
3224160	3227120	Through the lens of an experiment like we would an animal experiment
3227440	3233840	We think that animal is sick if you saw an animal digging in the corner looking looking looking looking for a bone the dog
3233920	3239440	Is looking looking looking looking looking looking looking looking you'd think that's really sad. That's us
3240080	3245600	Right, that's us. I'm pointing at myself intentionally. That's us. So we have to learn to self-regulate the amount of time
3246160	3247200	but
3247200	3251760	That doesn't have to be a process of you know scruffing ourselves and saying don't do it
3251760	3257440	Don't do it think about it in terms of the positive the more time away from something the more positively reinforcing
3257440	3262000	It will be when you return and that just to sort of superimpose this onto the relationship conversation
3263120	3264240	you know
3264240	3267520	Many of us are fortunate to have partners that we love spending a lot of time with
3267920	3270800	It's also good to miss that person every once in a while now
3270800	3274160	That might be an hour for some people apart of no communication
3274160	3276800	It might be a week everyone varies on this on the spectrum
3277200	3281760	But the idea of missing someone is that positive anticipation that kind of pain, right?
3281760	3285680	It's a motivational state and then when you see them, it's all the richer so you can
3286320	3292560	Imagine that the dopamine circuits can be used to more successfully navigate a number of different things
3292960	3298640	And you know a lot of couples completely quash the excitement and the pleasure of being together not just physical pleasure
3298640	3301440	But just pleasure of being together because they just
3302000	3306080	Spend too much damn time too much familiarity or they're texting all the time, right?
3306320	3310880	or the you know and and this whole thing around texting has become a really interesting test of
3311520	3312720	Dopamine expectation
3312720	3320000	There's a thing called dopamine reward prediction error if you think the reward is coming and it doesn't you drop below baseline levels of dopamine
3320080	3322800	That's why you should never tell someone that this restaurant is going to be the best restaurant
3322800	3326160	You've ever been to in your life. Exactly. I made the mistake of telling my girlfriend on the way here
3326160	3330000	I wanted her to read this book. I'm like this is an amazing book. You should read it and I caught myself and I thought
3330240	3332400	Damn it. I'm actually detracting from how
3333520	3335520	Good she's going to experience the book
3336080	3340720	Tell her it was terrible. Oh, yeah, it's really good though. This is the problem. It's hard to do
3341280	3342400	so
3342400	3344400	I think the key is to
3344880	3347920	To leverage dopamine reward prediction error in the best way
3348000	3354400	It's the surprise that you know, if you take kids driving home from school and suddenly you pull into the ice cream shop
3355040	3356480	They're going to be so ecstatic
3356480	3358800	But if you tell them you're going to go to the ice cream shop and it's closed
3359520	3360880	Huge drop below baseline
3360880	3364080	Does that mean if you tell them that you're going to the ice cream shop and it's open?
3364240	3368000	That's less than not telling them you're going to the ice cream shop and it's surprised. Correct
3368080	3370080	It's it's they literally tear out into
3370480	3375600	Maximum surprise is the maximum dopamine release then successful completion of the mission
3376320	3378320	As it were is the next and then
3378640	3382160	Unsuccessful is there not an argument to be made that you would be able to
3382800	3386720	Drag out the amount of time that dopamine is released for because of the anticipation
3387440	3393600	Yeah, so well and people do this in relationship quite a lot right anticipation is the kind of ultimate fuel
3394160	3398880	Of the courting dance, right? I mean this is also but one has to be very careful
3399200	3403200	Because whether or not it's from the male side or the female side or whatever variation thereof
3403680	3409520	That there's a you only get so many reward prediction errors before people start to
3410320	3412320	predict or associate
3412560	3417440	Low dopamine with somebody or some experience in other words if you you know, I'll use an example
3417920	3418720	Not for my own life
3418720	3422080	But if you say, you know, we're going to Costa Rica on vacation
3422560	3426320	And then you say listen, I have to work and they might understand but that's a letdown
3426400	3430080	It's a dopamine reward prediction error in the direction of lower dopamine
3430400	3433360	They might recover from it. They might not but most people recover from it
3433680	3436560	If you do that two or three times what ends up happening
3436640	3441680	You can model this beautifully and they've seen this experimentally in animals and humans then you say, okay
3441760	3445200	We're really going to Costa Rica this time and you think well
3445200	3448240	The surprise is going to be that you actually go the amount of dopamine
3448240	3454240	That's released for positive for successful completion of the initial goal is far lower than it ever would have been
3454480	3458560	So you can only cry. Well, I suppose that's not the right way to put it. You can only
3459360	3464160	um, create positive anticipation so many times and then create a letdown before
3465040	3468960	Completion that the prom delivery of the promise has very little impact
3469280	3472480	And so you have to be very careful with one's words better to say nothing
3473840	3475840	Then to let somebody down
3475840	3481040	For sure in the context of human relationship and you know, this plays out in some um less perhaps
3481520	3487600	amusing ways where you know, you look at people who are successful in life and you always hear success build success
3487680	3491280	And it's absolutely true like when students come to my lab and they do a phd thesis
3491280	3496480	It's very important for me to get them on to a research track quickly that they're going to experience some success
3496960	3498480	Because if they spend
3498480	3500320	Four years and then it fails
3500320	3507040	That's the devastating and then they have to start over again. Same thing with kids. I mean getting some success early on
3507680	3512560	Even if it's low bar success really does build up one's positive anticipation
3513200	3516320	An ability to perform well in the future because dopamine gives energy
3516400	3520640	Remember, it's the precursor to adrenaline and the sense that the world is predictable
3521280	3523440	Now this can go a wrong way too
3523760	3528640	And I see this a lot with the idea that everyone gets a blue ribbon. This is terrible too because
3529440	3534240	If everyone is rewarded every child is rewarded regardless of how well they performed
3534560	3538720	If they're all rewarded to the same level you actually flatten the dopamine curve
3539120	3542000	And so in that sense, yes, everyone might feel
3543520	3549280	You know celebrated but you actually are lowering motivation for the given activity
3549680	3551200	This has a whole
3551200	3555680	landscape of research in back of it relate to intrinsic versus extrinsic reward
3555840	3558640	The strongest motivation is always going to be intrinsic motivation
3558800	3564320	If you reward kids or adults for something too many times even if they like that activity they
3565280	3567520	The propensity to do that activity will be reduced
3567680	3571360	But if you reward without effort or without success
3571920	3577600	That is devastating for a nervous system. In fact, I've gone on record and I'll say it again and again and again, which is that
3578560	3580560	dopamine that
3580880	3582880	Arrives without prior effort
3583280	3584800	destroys people
3584800	3586480	this is
3586480	3593040	This is drugs. This is uh, you know, this is things like a cocaine and amphetamine. It's high levels of dopamine with no effort
3593040	3596720	Okay, they had to buy it. They had to find it. They did whatever it but that's no
3596720	3600000	There's no physical effort or mental effort involved in getting the dopamine peak
3600240	3604960	This is why hard work followed by reward great working hard on a relationship and then it gets better
3605040	3607040	There's a breakthrough whatever it is
3607280	3609280	That is powerfully positive
3609520	3613600	Dopamine that just arrives because you say, oh, you're here. So you get reward
3614240	3618800	Terrible and this is why rewarding every little positive thing that a child does with
3619520	3623680	You know their favorite thing eventually diminishes the value of that thing and diminishes their
3624160	3626160	ability to get motivated on their own
3626320	3630560	So a very very powerful system one has to be very very careful how one leverages it
3630880	3635920	What are your thoughts on dopamine detoxing? Is that legit? Does it work? Well up until about six months ago
3635920	3641120	I would have said no, um, but my colleague Anna Lemke was on the show. Oh, fantastic
3641360	3646480	Um, I have such admiration and respect. She's great. Yeah. Yeah. I just a brief anecdote
3646560	3649840	I was I directed neuroanatomy course for the medical students at stanford
3650160	3655120	I should have known who Anna was and then one day she came in to give a lecture on dopamine and addiction and my first thought was
3655200	3658320	Oh my goodness, you know have to get her on the podcast and have to I want her
3658880	3665040	Talking to the world because it's such powerful knowledge. So if people haven't heard that episode already go listen to chris talking to Dr.
3665040	3666160	Anna Lemke, I'm gonna listen to it
3666160	3670000	I've listened to all her podcasts that I was aware of but again, we were talking about it's hard
3670080	3672800	Sometimes hard to find podcasts. So I'm gonna listen to that
3673200	3675200	Um, cannot listen to her enough times
3675840	3677840	you know the
3678000	3679440	the dopamine
3679440	3683280	You asked earlier about the arc of dopamine and how long it lasts that the
3684240	3689120	One of the key takeaways from that book dopamine nation that I've incorporated in my own life
3689200	3694080	Is that there are certain activities like cold water that create long lasting arcs of dopamine
3694320	3698080	Those can be very useful for putting us into long lasting motivational states
3698560	3703280	So, um, these are not big peaks and troughs. These are the pain of the cold water
3703840	3706400	Followed by this long long arc of dopamine
3706640	3710800	Wonderful. It's kind of an antidepressant positive motivator natural stimulus
3711040	3713920	I always say if you don't have access to a nice bath cold showers
3714000	3720240	Yes, we'll work if you have a shower that doesn't get cold enough. Keep in mind that the original study showing this dopamine increase
3721040	3727760	Had people get into 60 degree water, which is not that cold 60 degree fahrenheit for 45 minutes to an hour
3728000	3729200	So your water bill might go up
3729200	3732720	But you could just draw a kind of cool bath and get in that up to the neck
3732960	3737360	So because I realized there are sometimes some cost barriers to people. They not everyone has a nice bath
3738000	3739200	no
3739200	3742880	Dopamine detoxing. Yeah, so dopamine detoxing is something that
3743440	3749360	Apparently today my uh short term working memory is off. I I swear I can't get that in you. I can't think of any
3749760	3751760	I'm caffeinated. I can't think of any, um
3752320	3755040	pharmacologic reason for it, but uh, no excuses
3755520	3756560	um
3756560	3759920	So dopamine detox I would have thought was not something real
3760560	3762560	It seemed kind of silly to me actually
3762960	3767440	And I'll tell you why it seems silly and why it still seems silly, but why it may have some utility but then ana
3768160	3773600	Dr. Anna Lemke told me that it actually can be quite useful to take some time and space away from
3774240	3780400	Social media certainly from any addictive drugs. That's the treatment for addiction and restore those dopamine levels to baseline
3781120	3786000	Now the way that dopamine detoxing was initially described in the bay area where seemed a lot of tech
3786320	3788320	Types we're talking about it
3788320	3792560	Was in terms of I heard something like oh people aren't even looking at other people's faces
3792960	3797280	You know, they're really kind of living this like monkish lifestyle and like no food of that
3797280	3802160	They really enjoy no anything that to me seems kind of crazy and kind of extreme
3802240	3807760	I mean, I can understand not ingesting a lot of highly palatable foods, you know eating somewhat blander foods
3808000	3814960	I can understand not um, certainly not doing any prescription drugs or taking some time off from caffeine caffeine increases dopamine receptors
3815120	3817120	Which makes the
3817360	3821360	The dopamine that's available more powerful at evoking the dopamine response
3823600	3826320	I can understand avoiding certain substances and behaviors
3826400	3829520	But the idea that you weren't going to look people in the eye because there's gonna be too much dopamine
3829600	3833600	I mean, I guess it depends on who you're looking in the eye and how much their look
3834480	3837760	positively arouses you but the fact of the matter is that that's not
3838640	3841440	That's not a very rational way to think about dopamine detox
3841680	3843840	But staying out of you know, high intensity
3844560	3846560	Highly rewarding activities
3846640	3851760	I think could be useful in terms of reestablishing that dopamine balance and everything we know from ana's work is that
3852560	3860480	Dopamine, you know, if you drive those dopaminergic states too long addictive drugs, etc. People can do this with sex food drugs gambling
3861680	3863680	social media all sorts of things
3863760	3865440	Um pornography
3865440	3870480	You know what ends up happening is the amount of dopamine that's released over time goes down and down and down and down
3870480	3875440	And pretty much is traversing into the territory of pain and then people again are back to this thing where you know
3875440	3877440	They're scrolling internet porn
3877520	3883680	8 9 10 times or hours a day and then they're wondering like why this isn't effective for them anymore whereas it was before
3884320	3890880	And there's an additional issue with pornography, which is not often discussed, which is that remember guys in particular
3892240	3894960	The brain is a learning prediction machine and if
3895920	3898080	I'm not trying to say that all pornography is bad
3898080	3901040	But there are good data to support the idea that
3901600	3905120	If your brain learns to be aroused by watching other people
3905680	3907040	Have sex
3907040	3912640	It is not necessarily going to carry over to the ability to get aroused when you're one on one with somebody else
3913040	3918000	Right the especially young kids who are consuming a lot of pornography. The brain is learning
3918720	3920720	sexual arousal to
3920800	3923920	Other people having so you're going to program yourself into being a voyeur
3924880	3931120	Yeah, or just create challenges in in sexual interactions with you know with with peer with a
3931600	3932800	With a real partner
3932800	3939520	Mary Harrington has the three laws of porno dynamics and the second law of porno dynamics is the law of fap entropy
3939920	3944080	And it says that whatever you start out wanking to will get progressively more intense over time
3944320	3949360	And I think that this is sort of speaking to that ever ever sort of escalating amount of
3950480	3953440	The wildness that you need to watch in order to get an ever decreasing
3954080	3959680	Stimulus that comes back. Yeah, and you know here. I'm I'm approaching this only through the lens of biology, right?
3959760	3962800	I'm not a you know, I'm not a psychologist, and I'm certainly not
3963280	3967200	Um political in it in any way at least not I have ideas about politics
3967200	3972640	But I just don't discuss them publicly, but the but the idea here is that you know, I'm not saying
3973440	3977360	Pornography as a stimulus is bad or good. What I'm saying is it
3978320	3980320	In its availability and its
3981120	3988960	Extreme forms. It's a very potent stimulus and very potent stimuli of any kind extremely palatable food
3989360	3991360	extreme pornography
3991440	3996640	Extreme experiences like bungee core jumping those set a threshold for dopamine release and
3997200	4002880	Anna will tell you that and I'm sure she did that the higher the dopamine peak the bigger the drop afterwards
4002880	4005920	And it's not that you drop to baseline you drop below baseline
4006560	4012160	So again, it's not these things aren't good or bad. They just have to be controlled in a way because
4013200	4016480	When people are pursuing dopamine peaks over and over and over
4016960	4021840	And they aren't getting them typically it's because they've been pursuing that activity
4022480	4026480	Far too often and you're saying perhaps take a break from that and there may be
4027120	4030240	An ability for yourself your system to reset, right? Yeah
4030320	4033200	Yeah, I mean in theory all the things that we're talking about with pornography
4033520	4037840	Could be superimposed onto food or could be superimposed onto real sex, right?
4039120	4041120	That one also has to be cautious there, right?
4041520	4042480	but
4042480	4048800	The cycling back and forth between dopamine and low dopamine states dopamine fasting as it were but maybe just
4049200	4051920	Low dopamine states. These are natural rhythms
4052480	4056720	That existed in the nervous system. We had to remember what the dopaminergic system is there for
4057360	4060880	I'll say it again. I wasn't consulted the design phase, but we know as a as a
4061360	4067360	Generic form of motivation and pursuit you can imagine the human or the animal that's hungry or thirsty
4067760	4071360	It needs energy to go pursue the thing. So the idea that you have to eat in order to get energy
4071440	4076480	That's true, but you need energy in order to get the thing to eat. So our nervous system has energy also
4076560	4078560	That's dopamine and epinephrine
4078640	4082000	Yes, we use glucose and glycogen etc when we're pursuing things
4082080	4087360	But the idea here is you're pursuing something and then either by smell or by sight
4087600	4091280	You think you're on the right track. So you go down that track and then ah, there it is
4091360	4095520	You know, you get some berries or you get, you know, let's get prehistoric about this or you get to kill
4096320	4100480	The prey and eat it and then it gives you energy to continue this pursuit or to reproduce
4100560	4104080	I mean, there's a reason why humans and other animals seek out reproduction is that every
4104640	4107600	Every species but certainly humans have two innate
4108240	4114960	Desires built into them whether or not they decide to actualize this or not is the desire to protect young and make more of its own species
4115280	4121120	Every successful species does that even if people don't have children in general people care about
4121680	4125920	Children that because they of what they represent very few people dislike children
4126000	4128240	I mean, there are a few mutants out there that dislike children
4128320	4130320	But you always worry about those kinds of people
4130640	4134400	Yeah, you were talking earlier on about the fact that dopamine can be released
4134960	4140240	When you set yourself a little goal and then achieve it and one of the ways that you encourage your grad students is to
4140560	4143680	Give them a little bit of reward earlier on so that it keeps them motivated
4143920	4147840	Is this the same mentality that works during an endurance event?
4148320	4151360	When you want to say i'm just going to get myself to the next lamppost
4151360	4154080	I've just got to get myself to that hill over there. Is that the same dynamic?
4154240	4156400	Yeah, um, we can call it milestoneing
4156480	4161200	You just set some milestone and the key thing here is that and this is the beauty of the dopamine system
4162160	4165440	Just like the stress system is generic the fear system is generic
4165520	4167520	It's designed for a bunch of different scenarios
4167920	4171120	The motivation system is also generic it can be
4171360	4172560	to
4172560	4178880	Achieve the next lamppost as a milestone or it can be five miles is the next milestone you get to control that
4179360	4181440	And it so it's completely arbitrary, right?
4181440	4186560	I mean in that one of the most brilliant things that was ever said to me by an extremely skilled psychoanalyst
4187280	4193600	Is so simple and yet I do think it's the most fundamental thing to understanding oneself is that it's all internal
4194080	4198960	Right if you finish a marathon in first place, no one comes along and drips dopamine in your ear
4199360	4204400	You self generate that it's all internal. It's all about your internal representation
4204720	4207440	Now that doesn't mean that there aren't good and bad events in life, but
4208160	4211520	The fact of the matter is that if you set the next milestone as
4212320	4216480	Just outside the distance of what you're comfortable with and you make it there
4217440	4220000	If you allow yourself a moment to register that win
4220640	4227280	You get energy to do to then set the next milestone and achieve it that energy is dopamine
4227440	4234480	converted into epinephrine into adrenaline and this is why you hear these incredible heroic stories like I mean
4234480	4236320	I think the movie sorry
4237040	4242000	I hate to say but the movie was less good than the book but like loan survivor the marcus latrell story and the
4242080	4248240	Actually, I think today or yesterday might be the anniversary of operation red wings. So all those guys sadly died except
4249200	4250160	marcus
4250160	4254880	And you know he in the movie he's it's like fast forward to where he I don't want to give it away
4254880	4257200	But where he basically is the loan survivor, but
4258400	4264000	In the book it's crazy. I mean the guy dragged himself on elbows and knees for miles and miles and miles, right?
4264320	4270560	You know that that kind of ability where you hear about people walking on stubs to you know, these incredible feats of human
4272400	4274720	Endurance and willingness to persist
4276320	4277600	those
4277600	4283600	People were able to do that not because of glycogen or they drank their goo or whatever the triathletes are always using
4283680	4285120	it's because of
4285120	4286640	nervous system
4286640	4294320	Energy the ability to continue to manufacture adrenaline and keep going and the and the extent to which that can continue is
4294400	4299920	No one will ever know I do believe that humans have a tremendous capacity to endure and persist
4300480	4306480	But that few human beings actually know how to tap into that system except under conditions of extreme survival
4306640	4308320	and you also hear from
4308320	4309920	really good physicians
4309920	4314320	Ones that aren't into woo biology or woo psychology at all that to some extent
4314640	4318000	Yes, there are people that unfortunately die in their battle against cancer
4318320	4324240	No matter what but that the the desire to continue living is a powerful force in of itself
4324960	4328400	There may be spiritual components. There may be that's not the business. I'm in
4328800	4331120	You know so and how I don't know the experiment I would do to test it
4331600	4336880	but almost certainly setting of milestones and the ability to generate dopamine and
4337440	4341840	Adrenaline is what allows people to persist and live longer. There's no question about that
4342160	4345680	One of the best books that I've read this year is the expectation effect by david robson
4346560	4351280	So he is a science writer from the uk and he looked at
4351920	4355520	A whole bunch of studies the placebo effect which everybody's familiar with right?
4355520	4362320	There is a particular expectation that an outcome is going to come from some sort of medication and lo and behold that outcome manifests
4362720	4367520	He found this across pretty much every area of anything that you care to care about
4367760	4371280	So my two favorite studies from this it was so so interesting
4371920	4378080	He realized that gluten intolerance self-report gluten intolerance has increased from 3 to 30 percent in 10 years
4378320	4383840	This is the why there's so many gluten-free options on the menu principally. They've got 30 of the population to serve
4383840	4386800	Yeah, so people need it and he was wondering. Well, what is it?
4387520	4392400	Human biology hasn't changed that much. Is it maybe that the foods have changed and people are responding to that?
4392720	4395280	Or is it maybe some sort of expectation because
4395920	4401200	The type of news stories that are hearing about gluten and about how bad it is for us and inflammation and all this sort of stuff
4401440	4404800	Maybe it's that and people are expecting it. So they brought people into a lab
4405440	4407920	They sit them down these people do and do not have
4408880	4410880	self-reported gluten intolerances
4411200	4413200	And they give everybody the same meal
4413600	4417440	They tell everybody in the room that it's got gluten in it. It's got no gluten in it
4418080	4419360	after a while
4419360	4420640	people who
4420640	4424320	Don't have a gluten intolerance biologically who haven't eaten gluten
4425120	4431040	Have diarrhea. They have hives. They're breaking out in inflammation. They're having to run at the bathroom. Okay. Well, that's kind of interesting
4431280	4434240	They did another another story that he spoke about
4434880	4440880	VO2 max tests that they were looking at apparently there's a particular genetic mutation that allows people to blow off
4440880	4443600	CO2 and upregulate oxygen in a better way
4444240	4448960	They brought people in even numbers of people that didn't did not have this genetic trait
4449760	4454560	Split them into two random groups. So there was a mix of both do and do not have the trait in each
4454880	4459440	First group was told you've got the right genetic trait. You should be really really good at this second group was told
4460000	4462240	Sorry, you don't have it. You shouldn't be too good
4463360	4468080	No surprise perhaps at the group that was told that they did they ended up performing better
4468320	4472320	But when they actually looked at what was happening in the physiology of these people
4473040	4477040	They found that the people who didn't have the genetic mutation but were told that they did
4477680	4482480	Had a lower overall lactate threshold. They had a lower overall heart rate
4482720	4485760	They were blowing off CO2 more effectively and upregulating oxygen
4486320	4489440	Better than the people who did have the genetic mutation
4489760	4495120	But were told that they didn't so he coined this term that said your expectations are even more powerful than your genes
4495280	4497280	I love that. I'm going to read the book
4497360	4499360	I that's a remarkable example
4500240	4505280	And I think that you know a lot these days is being made of epigenetic effects and things but this is almost in the different direction
4505280	4506480	This is a
4506480	4508480	psychophysiological
4508560	4509680	response
4509680	4515680	I find this kind of thing to be honest among the more fascinating and interesting aspects of neuroscience
4516080	4518240	If not the most interesting lately
4519920	4521280	Those examples are tremendous
4521280	4525040	So I can't counter those at all with anything more spectacular
4525360	4531200	But that the work of dr. Aliyah crumb at stanford. She runs the stanford mind body lab and she's done
4531840	4533920	simple experiments, but they're really elegant
4534960	4538640	Instructing people one group all about the terrible effects of stress
4539840	4544640	Destroys your immune system, etc. etc other people telling them also true things
4544720	4548320	But all the positive effects of stress it sharpens your ability of function
4548400	4552480	You can remember things better, etc. etc. You see exactly what
4553360	4556240	You are told basically now you can't lie to people
4556800	4558800	You can't tell them things that aren't true
4558960	4564320	It's just about the subset of information that you get dictates the response you get and perhaps the most traumatic
4564640	4566800	Was they gave two different groups of people
4567520	4570800	And then they actually each got the opposite condition to a milkshake
4571200	4573920	One group is told this milkshake is very high calorie
4574240	4576400	It contains a lot of fat and sugar, etc
4576800	4578400	Another group is told
4578400	4582320	The milkshake they're getting is very low calorie. It's very nutrient sparse, etc
4582480	4586960	Then they measure hunger so how long it takes for them to get hungry again after ingesting it
4587040	4588800	They also look at insulin
4588800	4592480	And they also look at ghrelin this hormone that is secreted
4592960	4597280	Um as you get essentially makes you hungry. It's associated with hunger. There are other things too, but
4598640	4602640	You see exactly what you would expect which is that people that get the nutrient dense milkshake
4603360	4607200	Are satisfied for longer their ghrelin is suppressed and their insulin is higher
4607440	4612080	You see the opposite in the group that had the the so-called low calorie shake turns out. It's the exact same milkshake
4613200	4617920	This is remarkable right because this is not simply the placebo effect
4618160	4624080	I think it's the placebo effect plus the expectation effect plus a real physiological effect because that's what you describe as well
4624480	4629200	And the way that ali dr. Ali chrome she she goes by
4629440	4632480	The way she describes it is that any
4633680	4635200	event
4635200	4637200	Causes a real physiological response
4637360	4644080	But that real physiological response is braided in with our expectation and our understanding of what the response ought to be
4644560	4649280	To create the actual response. So it's sort of real plus perceived equals
4650000	4654000	Actual reality. Yes, exactly. And so, um, I love this kind of thing as you can tell
4654080	4658080	I'm eating up the example that uh that you gave I think it's spectacular because
4658720	4661680	What it means is that no, we can't lie to ourselves
4661840	4666560	We can't tell ourselves that you know, drinking water is going to sustain us just as food would for
4667200	4668880	For five days. We're not going to be hungry
4668960	4673440	But to some extent if one understands that well, you can survive a long time on just water
4673840	4678240	And you don't need to eat then you might experience less hunger. That's the way the nervous system works
4678320	4683040	Well, you can definitely survive longer on just water if you believe that you can survive longer on just water
4683760	4688000	There is no reason not to believe this. So I was really really averse to the whole
4688720	4693760	Ronda burn the secret who sending out messages to the universe and david
4694720	4702000	Uh positions himself very anti that as well in the book. Um, but you can't deny the fact that the positive thinking has a real
4703200	4708320	physiological impact on what you do. He was talking about um, they did a study with
4709200	4710800	older people
4710800	4716240	That were past retirement and they asked them to use what what sort of words do you associate with getting older?
4716480	4720160	And they split these people into two different groups and the sort of words that people used
4720560	4728000	Perfectly mapped on to how long they were going to live. So the people that use the sort of words alone frail fragile injury death
4728560	4731520	They were the ones that lived the shortest the people that said
4732000	4733200	um
4733200	4735200	happiness freedom liberty
4735760	4737040	connection
4737120	4744800	Maturity those sorts of words were the ones that lived the longest so your expectations can literally impact your longevity
4745360	4751280	There's I I'm yet to read the book in detail, but I've talked to a guy named ethan cross. He wrote a book called chatter on the show
4751360	4758080	Oh fantastic. Okay. I think that internal chatter world is a very interesting one that neuroscience will eventually have something to to say
4758640	4762320	Uh about I think the most powerful mindset
4762880	4766480	Uh, at least to me is one that again, I learned from ali crumb
4767360	4769360	This is a mindset that in her
4769440	4772640	Pure reviewed studies of different populations. It's clear exists
4773120	4775120	Um universally and people in the SEAL teams
4775680	4777680	but um less so
4777920	4780880	Or is perhaps even absent from the general population sadly
4782720	4784720	The idea that stress grows you
4785440	4789440	That challenge grows you, but isn't the only way that you can grow
4790080	4795600	I think is a very powerful mindset. So what do you mean by that? So they she what they did is she surveyed a bunch of different
4796160	4799600	People with different professions and asked, you know, what's your view of stress? Do you think it grows you?
4799600	4801200	It diminishes your ability, etc
4801200	4802560	So this isn't giving people information
4802560	4808720	This is asking them for information and the only group that said stress grows you the more challenge the better you get
4808800	4812720	Etc the more stress you experience the more likely you are to to succeed
4813280	4818000	Was the this group from the SEAL teams? I don't know if they were new recruits or if they had been in a long time
4818000	4820080	But that was the the group
4820080	4825680	I would add to that that yes, if you adopt the mindset that stress grows you you're going to be much better off
4826160	4831680	But also that stress is not the only way to grow in life, right? There's this idea, you know, we have this
4832400	4836720	And again, there's sort of a gravitational pull of this. I like stress grows. Yes, you know
4837040	4841440	Forward center of mass or you know, always be in friction limbic friction limbic friction
4842720	4844720	How about a more
4845040	4847200	expansive or nuanced version of that might be
4848160	4852480	Stress grows you so if you're under stress you're back on your heels from something you think, okay
4852480	4857520	How can I get flat-footed or even forward center of mass you tell yourself stress grows me stress grows me stress grows me
4857760	4863440	But that doesn't mean stress is the only thing that will grow you right learning to cycle between periods of hard work and deep
4863920	4865920	What I call non-destructive
4866080	4871760	Uh deliberate reset, right? Um, that's what really works over time. I can attest to that
4872240	4876720	You know people who just really go out and tie one on in order to to recover
4877200	4881840	You can only get away with that for a few years before your body and mind start to give out, right?
4881920	4885360	so fine non-destructive ways to reset and
4886400	4889840	Also adopt the mindset that stress grows you and adopt the mindset that
4890560	4895920	You know, there are other ways to grow that don't involve stress and I think you're set up to have a pretty fantastic life
4895920	4899680	That's my you know, simple view of of the way these things work
4900080	4902880	Speaking of endurance and suffering
4903840	4906480	What have you learned from lex Friedman since you've been friends with him?
4907040	4911040	The guy works a lot. You can text him or call him at pretty much any hour except
4911520	4915360	Um, the early morning hours that he happens to be in because he's likely to be asleep
4915760	4918560	You know lex is a really interesting one. Um
4919600	4920880	because
4920880	4922880	You know like a lot of scientists and engineers
4922960	4926320	Yet he has that ability to really drop into the trench which is
4926880	4929840	Certainly not unique to scientists and engineers, but is really helpful
4930400	4936640	I think you lex comes at things from a from at once a very engineering physics perspective
4936880	4941280	Which you know, obviously computer science robots and all AI and all that he loves that stuff
4941680	4945120	But you know, there's a phrase that he's used over and over again in our conversations
4945200	4948640	And he's talked about this publicly and I've started to pay a bit more attention to
4949120	4953760	Because he says it so many times which is you know approach life with love in your heart
4954240	4957520	You know, which is weird, right? You think about an engineer who's thinking like this goes there
4957600	4961600	And this is what it's going to predict the best outcome and then you think like approach things with love in your heart
4961760	4965680	And I think he's right because and I think that is very powerful because
4966480	4968480	There are so many pitfalls
4968960	4971360	And by pitfalls what I mean are energy sinks
4971840	4975120	That you know across the day from the time you wake up until you go to sleep at night
4975120	4979520	There's so many places for you to put your energy can go into online battles. It can go into
4980240	4984560	Uh, you know texting five different people. It can be investing in one person
4984640	4989680	It can be there's so many things and so much of success in any domain is about
4990160	4993280	Yes, maintaining focus. We hear about that a lot focus focus focus
4993360	4999280	But what is focus focus is really about not allowing energy to dissipate into these kind of meaningless trails
4999920	5007280	So I think about lex and I as I do for all people. I think, you know, what animal does he best represent or what animal best represents him
5007440	5009920	I think of all people like this. I have this kind of weird
5010320	5013600	Process where after I spend some time with somebody it just pops to mind
5013600	5017680	Like I can't tell you what animal comes to mind yet. You might see that after the ice bath later on
5017760	5022160	We'll see how long it's you might be you might be a polar bear. Um, super comfortable in the water
5022480	5025440	Um the cold water, but I think that you know at some point
5025520	5031520	I realized that that lexes gets very fixated on things very very fixated
5031840	5033840	But he also knows how to disengage
5033920	5039600	And he really avoids energy sinks through this and losses through this kind of love
5040080	5042080	Thing that he's really into
5042080	5048480	Because anger is very energetically demanding. It's great fuel, but it's not efficient fuel overall
5048960	5052240	Right, it's it's like having a gas tank full of fuel, but there are a lot of leaks in it
5052640	5056480	Whereas I do think that doing things out of genuine desire. There's a calm
5057120	5061440	Sort of energized balance that comes with that and you feel like you can go forever
5061680	5064400	So this is starting to sound a little bit. Woo. It sounds like, oh, you know
5064400	5068080	The heart is more powerful than the adrenals and like they're both powerful
5068240	5071520	The adrenals can keep you alive and enduring for a long long time
5071600	5076640	But if you do things out of anger and friction for too long your immune system will crash. We know this
5077440	5079440	but it is
5079680	5084320	Essentially infinite how much energy you can derive out of genuine desire
5085120	5087680	To engage with something or somebody what animal is he then?
5088480	5092160	You know lex. Well, his hair makes me think he's some spiky thing
5092240	5097440	He's sort of like he's some he sort of has the like the persistence of the porcupine
5097920	5102400	But he has he's definitely has I think he as much as I don't want to admit it because I wish it were me
5103040	5108880	Not him, but I think the animal that best captures lex because he's also a bit of a loner is the wolverine
5109280	5113360	I've spent a lot of time thinking about actual wolverines. Not the Hugh Jackman version of wolverines
5113360	5119680	But the actual wolverines they're very solo animals unless they pair up to mate. They're incredibly strong
5119760	5121760	He is freakishly strong
5121840	5125680	I've done jujitsu with him. I'm not good at jujitsu. He is he's a black belt jujitsu
5125760	5129280	But he is freakishly strong. So if I had to pick an animal I'd say probably
5129760	5133360	Um the wolverine. What's interesting about him. I went to
5133920	5138160	Thanksgiving with him last year, which was my first time of enjoying that holiday here, which is a fantastic holiday
5138240	5142080	I actually think we don't have something in the uk where people sit back and do that
5142560	5147440	Gratitude reflection period except for Christmas, you know people do that end of your review
5147440	5150400	But I really think and especially the time of your it's in it's perfect. So
5151520	5153520	we were talking and
5154240	5155840	He was talking about the fact that
5155840	5156800	He was working hard
5156800	5162960	But he feels this gap between where he is and where he could be which I sounds like less sense is a common
5163520	5165520	pattern. Yeah, and
5165520	5170560	He was saying that a lot of the friends that he speaks to will say, you know, you're doing well. You're working hard
5171200	5172400	and
5172400	5176880	He looked me in the eyes and he's like, I don't want them to say that I want them to tell me to suck it up
5177040	5181840	I want them to tell me that I need to stop being such a pussy and keep going as I it takes an
5182240	5186000	Unbelievably singular person to work as hard as he does. I don't think that the internet
5186800	5189520	Whatever people know about how hard he works
5190080	5194560	Is only a small sliver of just how obsessive and committed he is
5194960	5198640	And for him to say that he wants to be around more people that push him in that way
5198880	5200880	It made me realize that
5201440	5202640	perhaps
5202640	5206080	I could be offering more to my friends as well that
5206560	5208560	offering them just sort of
5208880	5210320	support
5210320	5211840	in the form of
5211840	5217600	acceptance and and presence and I'm hearing you and dude, you're doing great or whatever reassurance in that way
5217920	5222320	Maybe isn't always the best way to go about things. So yeah, that was it's just something that stuck in my mind
5222320	5224880	It's something it's a little model that I've kept with me where I'm thinking look
5224960	5227200	Does my friend need me to tell him that he's doing good?
5227440	5231360	Or does he need me to tell him to suck it up and get his nose down because I know that you can do it
5231680	5235440	Sounds very much like lex I'm learning about your your internal workings a bit too
5235680	5239680	There are three kinds of reward two of them are often discussed one is rarely discussed
5239680	5244160	And but is pretty powerful and I think it's useful to think about toggling between these different rewards
5244400	5246880	Whether or not for ourselves or whether or not in trying to
5247520	5249520	stimulate and motivate other people
5250160	5252800	One of course is reward. You did great
5253200	5256240	Congratulations. That was awesome. Love that podcast
5256720	5262160	Great that you got an a plus on your report card or b plus because last year you got a c whatever it is reward
5262640	5264640	Then there's punishment, right?
5264880	5267360	This is obvious you screwed up like
5268720	5273760	You take something away or you take the anticipation of reward away, whatever it is you screwed up
5273760	5278160	You're punished you're grounded, etc. You're not watching tv for a month or whatever it is no screens for a month
5278640	5283040	Then there's the third kind of reward, which is the reward that you hang out in front of somebody
5283600	5286480	At a distance like a carrot on a stick out in front of them
5286800	5293440	Which is not reward for what they've accomplished, but reward that they can anticipate if they accomplish something
5293920	5295440	I think this could be
5295440	5300560	Very effective in the context that we're talking about it, which is how would I do this with lax?
5300640	5304080	I'd say, you know, I really loved this particular interview
5304800	5311040	If only the next time you have that person on you also asked them this, right? That's not a punishment
5311280	5315920	You're not saying it sucked because it didn't include this. You're not saying it wasn't great. You're saying
5316720	5318720	If next time you were to do that
5319360	5320880	I think it would be even better
5320880	5326480	So you're hanging a potential reward out in front and I think that can be a very powerful motivator
5326800	5330160	So you can you know, we could build up a number of different examples around this
5331120	5336000	But this is not often talked about in sort of reward punishment schedules and motivation
5336000	5340560	We always think reward and punishment, but we think immediate reward immediate punishment
5341120	5343120	Now in terms of building habits
5343760	5348240	And goal setting and goal seeking we know that visualizing failure is
5349280	5356480	For better or for worse is a far better motivator than visualizing success if you want to get people motivated to start
5357280	5361040	All right to start now getting people to continue
5361520	5365360	Involves regular rewards for reaching milestones. However, and I should have said this earlier
5365920	5372080	I want to make sure that we do emphasize that the best schedule really is random intermittent reinforcement
5372160	5377520	So if you're setting milestones on this run or in your intellectual pursuits or business pursuits or relationship pursuits
5378320	5383280	If you set a milestone and you get there you do want to have a little bit of an internal celebration
5383360	5387600	Remember it's all internal so internal celebration not extrinsic celebration
5388800	5390000	And reward
5390000	5393200	But every once in a while it's good to just not reward yourself
5393600	5400240	Now at what ratio should you do that? Well, the the computer modeling data say that the optimal ratio of success
5400720	5402640	successful trials and
5402640	5407760	Unsuccessful trials for learning and motivation is going to be about 85 of the time to reward yourself
5408720	5411600	And about 15 of the time to not reward yourself
5411600	5415280	So random intermittent lack of reward is another way to think about it
5415520	5418240	And I talked about this with jocco a little bit and he thought oh, yeah
5418480	5423040	Probably what we should do is have workouts where it's a big fishbowl full of ping pong balls
5423280	5425680	And about 15 of them are marked with reward
5425840	5428720	But the other ones is you do something and you get to go take a ping pong ball out
5428720	5431280	And if you take that out then you get some reward
5431920	5437120	If it's marked and if it's not then you don't and rather than every time you accomplish something
5437200	5440960	You go reward yourself. So here we're talking we're getting kind of into the weeds of reward schedules
5440960	5442960	But I think if you really want to support a friend
5443040	5444960	Punishment you should use very judiciously
5444960	5448320	Although if they really screw up a good friend as they say we'll put
5448960	5452240	The friendship ahead of the friend or the friend ahead of the friendship. Excuse me
5452880	5455200	The friend ahead like you're going to tell them what they really need to hear
5455200	5458320	Even if it compromises the friendship if you really believe they need to hear that
5459440	5462720	Other times reward like that was awesome. Congratulations. And then
5463680	5465680	Occasionally if it's warranted
5466400	5468400	That was great ish
5468480	5472880	But it would be so much better if the next time you did this or that was great
5472960	5476560	But you know, honestly, I think it was a mixture of good and not so good
5476880	5481920	So I think those are three powerful ways to reward and they can be mixed up and toggled back and forth
5482000	5487440	According to whatever schedule allows that person to continue. What is your morning routine look like at the moment?
5488240	5490240	morning routine is
5490240	5491520	wake up
5491520	5493360	if I
5493360	5494560	Run about what time?
5494560	5500640	I'm waking up these days around 6 a.m. 6 30 a.m. I'm trying to go to sleep by about 10 30 p.m
5500960	5502960	Sometimes it's 11. Sometimes it's 10
5504640	5506320	I wake up
5506320	5511200	And I have to be careful here because that whenever I've described my routine in a little bit of detail people always say
5511200	5513200	I can't believe you don't go to the bathroom. That's like well
5514240	5520480	So I want to my pants exactly right foot left foot. So I want to be clear. I take care of my basic functions
5521360	5524160	But when I wake up I make a beeline for sunlight
5525440	5528160	So I'm going to get sunlight in my eyes for the you know
5528160	5531600	I'll probably go into the grave saying this so forgive me if people have heard me say this before but
5532000	5536640	The single best thing you can do for your sleep your energy your mood your wakefulness your metabolism
5537040	5543760	Is to get natural light in your eyes early in the day. Don't wear sunglasses to do it takes about 10 minutes or so
5544400	5547920	Um, if you live in a cloudy area if you're in the uk in the winter
5548400	5552480	Yes, or the summer or the summer. Maybe you resort to some artificial light as a replacement, but
5553200	5555200	As much as one can get bright
5555360	5558320	natural and if not natural artificial light in your eyes early in the day
5559040	5560880	without sunglasses
5560880	5562640	contacts and
5562640	5566560	Eyeglasses are fine. Don't try and do it through a window or windshield. It's going to take far too long
5566960	5569120	This sets in motion a huge number of different
5569840	5575120	Neuro biological and and hormonal cascades that are good for you reduces stress late at night
5575440	5579760	Offsets cortisol a million different things really that are good for you. So I get that
5580640	5583520	And yes, some that walk do not walk ideally that would be a walk
5583520	5586560	but sometimes we'll just go into the yard and have some coffee and and
5587200	5593040	You know, soak into whatever sunlight through through the clouds if it's a cloudy overcast day, it might be 20 30 minutes if it's a
5593840	5596320	Um, it's a very bright day. It might just be a few minutes
5596320	5601680	But really the the quality studies on humans that have looked at this say try and get as much
5602160	5606080	Natural light as you can in the morning hours whenever it is that that is for you
5606720	5610000	Especially the first three hours after waking if you can work outside great
5610000	5614480	If you can get in your window because as opposed to just in a dark conference room, that's better
5614480	5618080	But if you can get outside, that would be fantastic. So I get sunlight
5618560	5623600	I hydrate I drink water and then yerba mate is my favorite form of coffee. Excuse me caffeine
5623680	5628000	Are you waiting? How long are you waiting from 90 to 120 minutes? Are you doing any salts during that time?
5628080	5633920	Are you taking any electrolytes in I am a fan of water with element before I had element packets
5633920	5637520	I would just take a little bit of sea salt or pink salt your favorite element flavor
5638080	5642240	I like them all. There's one I don't like. I'm not a fan of the chocolate one, but I like either
5642400	5648000	Yeah, some people love it. My podcast producer his wife loves that. So I give it to her the chocolate mint one
5648000	5650320	but um, I like the raspberry the
5650880	5657200	Um, the citrus one. I love that stuff mango chili is if you open the mango chili and breathed in shortly afterwards
5657280	5661440	It's like being pepper sprayed. It's absolutely insane. It's like it's like being blasted in the face
5661600	5666160	But yeah, I mean that's that's just the best way that cold glass of water and that first thing in the morning
5666400	5668400	and I mean it was you who
5669280	5674560	Reassured me of the what I thought was bro science about your adenosine system not being active for the first 90 minutes
5674640	5678400	And if you're going to pump caffeine onto that, you're not really actually acting on that
5678400	5682480	Your adrenal system is the one that you need to be looking at optimal you hydration all that sort of stuff
5682880	5685600	It's just such a good way to start the day. So okay, we've got
5686400	5690240	90 minutes deep what have you been doing in that you've had your light in the eyes
5690320	5692640	What have you been doing between that and the yerba matter in 90 minutes?
5693280	5695280	I do everything I can to
5695760	5697200	Not do email
5697200	5701600	Not do social media and to take care of a few critical tasks these days
5701680	5705040	I'm I have this obsession with trying to do one
5705760	5707760	Cognitively hard thing a day
5707920	5708960	one
5708960	5714960	And one physically hard thing a day now does it not extreme physical not david goggin's level workouts or anything but
5716480	5720320	In that 90 minutes, I'll typically try and read a research article start to finish
5720720	5726480	Or I'll work on a document that I might be doing a grant or research paper or planning a podcast or researching a podcast
5727040	5731040	I try and get my brain into kind of a linear mode. I try and narrow that aperture
5731680	5733680	As if I don't the distraction
5733760	5738400	That's created by social media and interactions with others can kind of wick out into the rest of the day
5738880	5742720	So I'm not necessarily trying to finish something in that time, but I try and do something
5743200	5745200	Challenging I experience great
5746160	5748160	pleasure from
5748480	5750400	Battling through something mentally challenging
5750400	5756160	But that's something that I built up since my university years when I was about you know 19 or so got serious about school and
5756720	5758080	Really started to
5758080	5762720	Experience the the deep pleasure of like I figured that out or like that was really tough
5763120	5766720	I don't always succeed, but that's what I'm doing in that hour to 90 minutes
5767440	5769440	But I confess sometimes
5769440	5773360	We'll take a walk during that time and maybe talk through some things that are that are challenging
5773680	5778640	You know or sometimes I get lazy and I miss a day of that cognitive challenge
5779120	5781680	Then I do caffeine about 90 to 120 minutes
5782720	5784720	after waking and
5784880	5787280	Even though I prefer to work out earlier
5787760	5792480	I generally will then do some sort of physical workout. I have a very consistent routine
5792480	5796640	I've done over 30 years where I weight train for 45 or
5797120	5800880	Minutes to an hour every other day and occasionally I take an extra day off
5801200	5806480	And occasionally due to travel or other commitments. I'll occasionally double up two days and then take two days off
5806880	5812640	So it's really boring, you know talk about workout schedules, but it's really simple. It's like, you know, I'll do a
5814320	5820080	Kind of pushing day rest pulling day upper body push up rest upper body pull
5820560	5826960	Rest and then legs take two days off something like that. Are you doing on the off days? Are you doing some sort of zone three?
5827840	5833120	Always jogging or skipping rope. Those are my favorite forms of cardio sometimes swimming
5833120	5836240	But typically I'll go running for 30 to 45 minutes
5836720	5841840	Or if I'm feeling a little bit lazier because I always find the high intensity stuff to be easier than the long drawn out stuff
5842480	5847600	I'll sometimes throw on a weight vest a 30 or 50 pound weight vest and I'll go out for a shorter run
5848080	5851600	Or I'm a big fan of knees over toes. Ben Patrick. I know you had him on
5852240	5855840	We were down in Costa Rica with him and his wife who had the best time and learned so much
5856800	5858800	I'll occasionally
5858800	5860800	Do a backwards, you know, he'll walk
5861440	5866800	Or throw on the weight vest for that. We sometimes we'll get bands and we'll so there's a great way to combine this
5867280	5873040	We will sometimes get two people in one of these thick bands do hill walks in the morning while getting our sunlight
5874000	5878320	But that I don't really consider a workout. I consider that just kind of rehabilitate us at movement
5878560	5882320	So on the off days I'm doing cardio and sometimes that's the morning. Sometimes that's in the evening
5882320	5886800	I do not like to wait trained on the second half of the day because I like to be really caffeinated when I wait train
5886800	5888800	I like to listen to loud fast music
5888960	5891360	Most of the time not always I keep my phone
5892400	5895120	Out or off of for most workouts
5896400	5901840	Podcasts maybe if I'm running but I really try hard when I'm working out to just focus on the workout
5902160	5905520	And those workouts the weight training workouts are always 10 minutes or so of warm-up
5905680	5910160	And then no more than 40 to 50 minutes of really hard work
5910240	5912240	If I do train hard any longer
5912400	5914640	I don't recover enough to be able to come in a few days later
5914960	5917920	And when I train that way I generally make pretty consistent progress
5918080	5922480	And you're taking yourself up until what's that probably maybe 10 30 11 a.m. Something like that
5922560	5925360	Yeah, and then I'll eat my first real meal now occasionally
5925440	5927920	I'll wake up really hungry if I didn't eat that well the night before
5928320	5931440	But typically the after I train I yeah, I'll eat
5931520	5938880	I like oatmeal after I train oatmeal fruit some fish oil protein drink and then maybe 90 to 120 minutes after that
5939360	5943040	I'll have a real lunch. My lunch is pretty much the biggest meal of the day if I have my way
5943200	5945200	It'll be a steak a salad
5945680	5948320	Maybe a little more starch although I sort of got it earlier
5948880	5955280	Um, brazil nuts and that meal sometimes can extend longer and longer. I love being a feeding. I love to eat
5955360	5960400	Yeah, so I'll eat and then I confess I usually will work a little bit more for about 30 minutes or an hour
5960480	5962480	typically email and then I'll take a
5962560	5963600	um
5963600	5965200	10 to 30 minute
5965200	5968960	Yoganidra nap or a nap and then come back refreshed
5969600	5974240	Um, I really struggled with the naps man. I come back after that and my emotions are all over the place
5974320	5976320	I'm disoriented. Maybe it's because I
5976960	5982400	Struggled to fall asleep super quickly and therefore I'm extending that period out for a little bit longer than I need
5982400	5987920	I probably need to try the Yoganidra thing. But for me, it's it I'm absolutely all over if I do that
5987920	5992880	I wake up and I don't know what day it is and my emotions always feel a little bit out of whack as well
5993040	5997920	I wake up grumpy from naps. Sometimes I'm told okay. There are a few times when I've woken up just really angry
5997920	6001440	I have no idea what that's about. I don't know any of the neurochemistry associated with that
6001520	6003520	Sometimes I wake up from naps. It's really pleasant
6003680	6006640	I'll occasionally if the nap is early enough in the day afterwards
6006640	6009600	I'll have a you know, a nice double espresso and get back into work
6009840	6013680	That's the hardest part of the day actually if I was well structured in the early part of the day
6013680	6020240	It's that two or three p.m. The key is then to try and get something really useful done cognitively again
6020480	6024560	So some people might look at this and say wait, you're working for an hour in the morning and 30 minutes here in an hour
6024560	6026560	in the afternoon when you actually working but
6027120	6029760	It's really about the depth of the trench when you're working
6030160	6033440	And so if I'm going to drop into something again for a few hours in the afternoon
6034320	6037920	I'm really going to drop into it and that's typically phone off and out of the room
6038240	6042560	And my goal is to get to the evening time so that I can do the things that I want in the evening
6042960	6046640	I can enjoy like I'm always setting a goal of the next time block
6047040	6050000	So this is something I've been doing for a long time, but even more so lately
6050000	6056160	I don't think my goal in the next hour is to do blank. I think this is dopamine reward predictions
6056960	6060320	Inaction, I think okay if I get this workout done
6060960	6064800	Then I'll be able to eat at more or less the same time which I enjoy and then
6065200	6068000	Something else will happen. So I'm very focused on what I'm doing
6068000	6071920	But I'm doing it for the purposes of like opening up the next door to the next thing
6072160	6076960	So if I can get that afternoon work block done, I'm thinking if I can just really get this podcast recorded
6077200	6081200	Which I enjoy is that your usual time to record middle of the afternoon used to be in the morning
6081520	6086320	But I'm getting I'm putting more and more preparation into them all the time my poor podcast producer
6086320	6088960	He's like, you know, I always joke that the one thing these podcasts
6089520	6094720	Probably will succeed in doing meaning my podcast is they're going to cure insomnia because some of them are so damn long
6095200	6101600	But I experience so much pleasure from spending a week or two researching something and then putting some structure on it
6101760	6105840	As you know, I mean podcasting is its own its own sort of natural drug
6106720	6109280	It just feels good if you enjoy doing this sort of thing
6109760	6113200	Um, so typically what we're starting late in the day now and going till pretty late
6113600	6117840	For me the problem that I have so I'm fasted right now. We're what one minute to 4 p.m
6118000	6123520	You haven't eaten anything today. No, no, nothing gracious. So but that's the only way if I eat I've my thoughts become slower
6123600	6127840	I'm not as verbally articulate. I'm nowhere near as agile now. I could push this super super late
6127840	6129840	I'm sure and it would be probably a pretty bad idea
6130880	6136320	Maybe I could avoid maybe I could go protein and fat or just mostly protein earlier on and that would have a void
6136480	6141120	But I just find that my thoughts and my verbal articulation just goes through the toilet
6141200	6144400	It's adrenaline if you I mean, I think that sorry to interrupt you
6144400	6149760	But if you ingest a bunch of glucose or you know, I think you're getting that I mean you've got to have a nice
6150080	6152480	I'm guessing that we were to tap your vein right now
6153200	6158160	If we could do micro dialysis on your brain that you have a nice low but steady level of adrenaline
6158640	6162400	And listen, this adrenaline thing this dopamine thing is no joke
6162720	6167840	This is the stuff of human evolution, right? This is the these are the same neurochemicals
6167920	6172800	This is this is the energy drink of human evolution. This is not the rock star red bull, etc
6172800	6177680	That stuff just hijacks this very system. I'm not saying it's bad. It's just feeding this very same system
6177920	6183520	So if you find an eating schedule or a fasting schedule that allows you to tap into that as a resource
6184160	6188400	I don't care what anyone says about whether or not fasting will make you live longer or not. Who knows, right?
6189280	6191280	If you're in the control group, you know, what's going to happen
6191680	6192560	So
6192560	6195280	But everyone presumably everyone dies eventually
6195440	6198560	So pick your pick your mode of eating be my guest
6198640	6201760	But if you figured out a way to tap into this
6202640	6209440	In a way that works for you by all means leverage that because until somebody comes along and says that intermittent fasting is unhealthy
6210000	6213280	Well, then to me it seems at least for me eating between 11 p.m
6213600	6215360	Excuse me 11 a.m
6215360	6217360	Ish and 8 p.m ish
6217840	6218880	Is great
6218880	6222720	And what I can also tell you is that having a consistent meal schedule
6223360	6227120	Meaning a feeding window. We absolutely know. I don't know why this isn't discussed more
6227120	6231920	We absolutely know that that helps anchor your sleep schedule and having a
6232320	6237920	Anchored sleep schedule helps anchor your light viewing schedule and a light viewing so it all starts to piece together
6238400	6244400	I think that what's lost in the discussion about nutrition except for the fact that most online discussions about nutrition are carried out by
6244480	6245920	Religious well, they're religious
6245920	6249200	But they also seem to be carried out by people that have it's like I don't know like like
6249360	6254320	Real feelings of powerlessness in themselves like it comes through like because they're quibbling over like
6254800	6258240	Whether or not you should eat a cracker or not or whether or not, you know
6259520	6263280	Inhaling oxygen, you know westward is going to break your fast or not
6264000	6269680	I'm obviously I once I said David Sinclair came on my show twice and he's a fantastic human
6269680	6271840	I know your friends with him and um
6271840	6276720	He talked about the fact that his resveratrol goes into a small amount of fatty yogurt
6277440	6279440	I think because it's like breakfast, right?
6279440	6282800	So you need to mix it in and it's homemade yogurt and something else and something else
6282960	6288240	And it's like that it's it's a shot of yogurt, right? It's enough for him to put his little capsule of resveratrol in
6288720	6293440	And the comments were a light with people. Oh, yeah, saying that's not a real fast
6294240	6296160	Because you've got it's so sad
6296160	6299680	You know, it's so sad that we can't have a nuanced conversation about nutrition online
6299920	6306400	That well, let's let's be fair calories in calories out applies, right? I don't think the laws of thermodynamics have disappeared
6306880	6307680	Um
6307760	6312800	And yet you have people who would argue that it doesn't and okay like we'll let them have their their arguments
6313040	6318720	I think that the key thing is when you find an eating schedule that works for the other things that you need to do in life
6318800	6320800	it's really beautiful because
6321680	6326880	Then you really start to exert some control over these energy systems. What we're talking about is focus and de-focus
6326880	6332640	We're talking about focus and deliberate decompression. We're not it's yoga nidra or a nap or simply a walk
6333200	6334240	um
6334240	6339760	And food as you point out is a wonderful source of caloric energy. We need it at some point
6340320	6344880	But it also can create this parasympathetic response where we feel very tired
6344880	6349040	Especially if you don't eat for long periods of time and then you eat substantial amount of starches
6349120	6351760	You will feel like calmer and more relaxed
6352160	6353440	this so
6353440	6355440	And maybe sleepy and maybe brain foggy
6355840	6360160	So I I've been you know, of course assaulted by this for this online
6360240	6367520	I do tend to eat some more starches in the evenings and fewer proteins and sure you can show me 20 double blind placebo controlled
6368320	6372400	Or randomized controlled trials saying that if you're gonna eat starches, you should eat them in the early part of the day
6372400	6374240	Well, I do that too after I train
6374240	6377040	But ultimately what I'm interested in doing is maintaining
6377600	6382560	The kind of bodily health and aesthetic that I'm looking for my blood lip is that I'm looking for
6382880	6384560	But I want to accomplish things in life
6384560	6388560	So I think if one gets too distracted by what's possible with nutrition
6388960	6392080	It can be it can really take somebody off target. No one ever
6392880	6394880	succeeded in creating anything useful
6395440	6400480	In terms of worker relationships by overly focusing on changing their dietary intake
6400960	6404960	But so once it works. So what once something works for you
6405440	6409040	I say just lean into it. Just lean into it and that can change over time
6409360	6413760	So that can really change over time. Do you know alex hall mosey? You familiar with him sounds familiar
6414000	6420000	Really hot shit on the internet at the moment this sort of gym bro who has founded this company and
6420400	6424960	Is now moving on to bigger and better things. He's eating. I'm pretty sure he's eating the same lunch
6425600	6426640	for
6426640	6430800	10 years or something. He always has the same lunch and he's got the exact same
6431440	6435600	Thought process around this that you do if you were going back to the morning routine thing
6436240	6438240	if you were to design
6438640	6443600	Or if you were to instruct someone to do the worst possible things in the morning
6443840	6446080	To set their day up for failure. What would they be?
6446720	6451280	Uh wake up and stay in bed. Uh, well, wait, there are good reasons to stay in bed in the morning
6451440	6453440	But once those are completed then
6454080	6455680	staying in bed
6455680	6461520	Is curtains drawn? Yeah curtains drawn just using your passively scrolling on social media
6462000	6463120	um
6463120	6464560	like there are
6464560	6467920	There are neurobiological data showing that when you are upright
6468480	6471360	You actually are stimulating this area of the brain called locus ceruleus
6471360	6475760	Whereas when you recline you actually are less alert. Literally the position of your body
6476480	6480800	Dictates some of your levels of alertness. That's why you suggest people to not sit like this
6481680	6483920	At their work desk, right? Yes, and if you're look and
6485120	6487120	If you're looking down
6487120	6491760	While working you're actually less alert than you could be if your eyes are averted slightly over
6492160	6496480	Most people that are on their phone including me and the postural stuff is really bad, too
6496480	6502320	I mean i'm getting i'm trying to really combat that internal rotation, you know that the c-shaped human kind of thing, you know
6503040	6507200	It's really not good. I'm really trying in fact one. This is so common now
6507760	6509760	the c-shaped human thing that
6510240	6516080	It almost feels strange to be upright, you know, like people think exactly the open the the uh
6516720	6521520	Sort of external rotation is good for us. We know this but in bed. I would say in bed
6521520	6526720	So people are on their phone. They're in bed. They're they're not getting enough light or they just artificial light
6526880	6529040	Where they're trying to get the sunlight through the window terrible
6530720	6535840	They are then going and sitting and getting into like hip, you know hip flexor contraction
6537120	6539120	They're drinking coffee too early in the day
6540640	6542640	They aren't getting into any kind of movement
6542720	6546480	But it's mostly about the sort of randomization of activities
6546880	6549040	Sort of making a cup of coffee while texting
6549920	6553120	Not getting sunlight, you know, then they're scattering that in with like a little bit of work
6553200	6556320	But then something hits that's stressful and they're diverting their attention
6556320	6559840	They're sort of building in this eight attention deficit like disorder
6560480	6566960	Through they're doing they're not single task. They're not monotasking and they're not being deliberate or intentional with the things that they're doing
6566960	6571200	They're just allowing the morning to kind of come and take them wherever the wind blows
6571280	6572000	That's right
6572000	6577840	And I have to say even though I describe my routine accurate my morning routine accurately if I were to really optimize it
6578160	6580960	And I've done this from time to time. I would get up
6581680	6584480	I would hydrate and I would immediately exercise
6585120	6587120	I would use that early
6587120	6592320	You know peaking of the cortisol response that comes with waking to get the body into action
6592480	6597200	Sort of jockel willing style right 4 30. I always see his posts, but I see them at 7 a.m
6597600	6599600	Yeah
6600320	6602960	So you know jockel was up before me again today
6603040	6607600	Yeah, he seems to always beat me by a few minutes unless I wake up in the middle of the night for a moment
6607760	6609200	but
6609200	6611840	To really get into action because that's going to generate its own
6612480	6617600	Dopamine and adrenaline response anytime I've worked out really early like if I have a flight and then
6618240	6620400	You know and then moved into the other components of my day
6621360	6623840	I find that I feel better all day long
6624240	6628720	I I also will say if I work out really early maybe between 7 and 8 a.m
6629200	6634160	Well, then my first meal might land at 9 a.m. So you know, you need to be flexible with some of these things
6634160	6638880	But the general principles apply I notice that you haven't put cold exposure into your morning routine
6638880	6640480	I'm going to guess you must have a cold tub of some kind
6640480	6641760	You have a cold tub in a sauna
6641760	6646400	I've been less good about that lately the best time to do that for me is on my cardio days
6646400	6651040	I do it after because you don't want to do it post hypertrophy because you're going to blunt some of the responses
6651040	6653840	That are actually you're trying to get by the the workout itself
6654000	6659440	That's right. And I have one I should say I have one rest day per week where I don't do any cardio or weight training
6659440	6662720	I really like doing having a complete rest day, but on that complete rest day
6663440	6664880	If I can
6664880	6666000	I'll do
6666000	6670240	20 minutes of sauna and then cold for three minutes 20 minutes of sauna and then cold
6670240	6671760	I'll make the rest day
6671760	6678080	Reparative yeah, and generally we make that social where we're talking about things and and we're very social in our working out like we
6678080	6680640	Talk my partner and I talk while we work out
6681040	6682720	You know when it's set when it's time to do a set
6682720	6684480	I become a little bit of like the drill sergeant
6684480	6688080	So like let's do your set do your set, but then occasionally I'm the guy doing a set and I'm like all right
6688080	6690560	So this afternoon we're you know
6690560	6696160	But I try and I try and really focus and I enjoy training by myself too, but generally we train together and then
6697120	6700480	And then typically if we're doing ice bath or sauna we try and coordinate those things
6700640	6704880	So I've seen a bunch of research about sauna. I've seen a bunch of research about cold exposure
6705360	6712320	Contrast therapy, which is huge here in Austin going from sauna to cold and it seems like 20 and 3
6712800	6714800	Three rounds is very typical
6715520	6718240	Is there something that we're gaining or something that we're losing?
6718880	6724400	By doing that cycle rather than doing a block of heat and a block of cold separately
6725040	6729520	Not that i'm aware of but you know that we finally have some good science to put to this and unfortunately
6729520	6734080	It wasn't from my lab. This is the beautiful work of susanna soberg who's over in scandinavia
6734320	6738240	Published a paper in cell reports medicine showing that the threshold you're trying to hit each week
6738880	6744960	Is at least you can do more but at least 11 minutes of uncomfortable but safe cold exposure
6745520	6752720	Per week total so that could be three minutes monday three minutes wednesday so on to 11 minutes and 57 minutes per week
6753280	6755760	Minimum so size. That's what they found
6756400	6758960	What did they find increases brown fat thermogenesis?
6759680	6763760	thereby metabolism thereby comfort being you know in cold etc
6765440	6767440	Clearly there's a resilience effect
6767520	6771920	Clearly there's a dopamine increasing effect and clearly you can do more you could do all that in one day
6771920	6776080	Or you could spread it out throughout the week or you could do more it kind of depends on what you're shooting for
6776240	6780400	How cold people always say how cold how hot well for heat is generally
6781040	6785200	Between 187 degrees fahrenheit and 212 degrees fahrenheit
6786320	6788320	Somewhere in that range and for cold it's
6789200	6791200	Cold enough that you really want to get the hell out
6791200	6794400	But that you can stay in safely because i don't want anyone to kill themselves with doing this stuff
6794960	6796960	Did i see you say that um
6798160	6799760	evening time
6799760	6801200	heat exposure
6801200	6807120	Increases growth hormone release by 16 times or something insane, but subsequent
6808160	6815280	Sessions of the same only increase it by a very small margin. Yeah, am i talking about my asset? No, you're absolutely right so we can
6816400	6818400	We can delineate some protocols
6819040	6823440	If you want to get better more resilient cold exposure is going to be great anytime
6824320	6826880	Post cold exposure your body is going to heat up
6826880	6833600	Think of your body heating up as waking up. So if you are concerned about not being able to sleep
6834240	6837440	Then i would suggest you do your cold exposure earlier in the day, right?
6838560	6841680	Heat does the opposite so i'm laying out some parameters here heat does the opposite
6841760	6843760	You're going to heat up while you're in the deliberate heat exposure
6843760	6846960	But afterwards there's a post heating dip in temperature
6846960	6852160	We can talk this was all covered in an episode with dr. Craig heller on thermogenesis gets a little bit down in the weeds
6852160	6856720	But take my word for it or if you want to get the science you can go there to find the science behind this
6857600	6859600	So sauna at night is great
6860160	6863760	As well now let's think about how to combine these things. So let's say you
6864480	6867440	You know you're on it. It's a tuesday. You've done your weight training on monday
6868320	6872720	And you want to do your heat and cold you don't have time to optimize everything perfectly you could say okay
6872720	6874160	i'm going to do my
6874160	6880800	Heat and cold at 10 a.m. Or 8 a.m. You get in the sauna for 20 minutes or so and then you get into the cold for three minutes
6881520	6883920	And then you might get into the sauna again for 10 minutes
6884640	6888400	And you get in the cold for another minute or so you end on cold
6888720	6892400	Why because it'll wake you up and presumably you're not you want to be woken up for the day
6892480	6897200	That also means don't then if you're doing it in a facility don't then go and have a warm shower
6897600	6901840	Right once you've finished right coolest shower is fine because you want to clean off often
6901920	6904160	I mean the ice bath is cleanish, but it's you know
6904800	6906800	Depends where you're going in laboratories
6906880	6911360	You're absolutely right in laboratories if we want to preserve something in particular a virus we put in the freezer
6911520	6913680	If you want to kill a virus you heat it up
6914320	6917520	This is never as dirty of a sauna as you want, but the cold tub
6917600	6922640	Well, yeah the sauna sort of its own autoclave if it gets hot enough right and the cold
6923120	6926960	Cold stuff needs to be cleaned out now and again you get mold growing in a in a freezer
6927280	6930640	Which is kind of freaky to think about but you really can't it's never going to grow in a sauna
6931040	6935040	Never going to grow if it gets hot enough now. There is what I call the sober principle
6935680	6941600	Uh, which is if you are using deliberate cold exposure to increase metabolism end on cold
6942080	6944320	So finish on the cold not just because it wakes you up more
6944320	6949360	But because then you have to heat your body up naturally, which is a thermogenic metabolic response
6950720	6956080	So end with cold and if you really want to push it you can do things like don't use a towel use evaporation
6956480	6960160	Uh spread out your limbs and don't huddle so that you have to shiver more etc
6960160	6964720	I mean a lot of little games you can play, but let's say you want to reduce post exercise inflammation
6964720	6968800	You're not concerned with hypertrophy gains of muscle size gains or strength gains
6969040	6975280	Well, then get in the cold after your your workout do that for one to some people can do 10 minutes reduce inflammation
6976000	6979040	Let's say you really want to hit growth hormone, which is what you asked
6979760	6986320	The biggest effects of sauna on growth hormone and they are big effects are when the sauna is only done once per week
6986880	6991040	But it's done in four cycles or sets we could say of 30 minutes each
6991040	6994240	So that means 30 minutes in the sauna at the temperatures I described before
6994720	6999760	Then a five minute break just air cooling off or 10 minute break then back into the sauna for 30 minutes
6999840	7003680	This is brutal. Then again in the afternoon 30 minutes in the sauna
7004400	7005520	then
7005520	7010080	10 minutes just air cooling off and then back into the sauna for 30 minutes. So that's two hours
7010640	7016960	At 187 to 212 degrees in one day in one day with a maximum of what less than sort of 20 minutes
7017680	7021600	Of rest in between those little sessions than the big rest in between. So you have to be very careful, right?
7021680	7027040	Heat can kill you. You got to hydrate. You need to make sure you get enough salt like it. I mean, this is this is work, right?
7027840	7032240	But you get you see in these human studies up to 16 fold increases in growth hormone
7032720	7035040	So you could imagine this could exert some very strong
7035440	7040640	Repairative effect if you're training for a big event or endurance event or maybe you're just really wiped out from the week
7040960	7045680	This is a stressor, but it's a stressor that delivers a potent growth hormone response
7045840	7048480	Now if you do sauna more often than that
7049200	7052720	You're not going to want to do two hours a day in the sauna because presumably you're doing other things
7052880	7054560	You have a life you have a life
7054560	7059760	And in addition to that the growth hormone effect starts to diminish if you become too heat adapted
7060480	7062480	And that raises a more interesting question, perhaps
7062480	7068480	Which is why is it that this two hour protocol really works if you do it once a week to increase growth hormone?
7068480	7071920	It's because it's a stressor and certain stressors increase growth hormone
7072480	7074480	Does it have to be heat? No
7074480	7078080	You could probably also do four really long rounds of ice bath
7078480	7080640	And i'm guessing you'd probably see a similar effect
7080720	7085760	No one's ever really looked probably see a similar effect because it's all about the stress stimulus
7086080	7091680	Now those that work on exercise science and weight training would probably say yeah, you could also do a
7092320	7095120	This has been shown, you know at 90 minutes 10 sets of 10
7095680	7101520	Multiple exercises for 10 sets of 10 high volume german volume training workout and get the same growth hormone effects
7101840	7103840	There's so many studies like this
7104720	7107440	I personally like to do the sauna two or three days a week
7108160	7113120	And if i'm traveling off and don't get the opportunity if i'm in austin, it's great because they're all these sauna places
7113920	7117920	But if i'm traveling abroad, i don't have the time then i might do i might take a day
7118000	7121200	I'm thinking wow i did three podcasts i'm exhausted when i'm in new york
7121280	7124960	I like to go to a place i have no relation to them, but i think it's called spa 88
7125040	7128320	It's a russian banya and i'll just go for the whole day
7129360	7131600	If i've been working really really hard they serve food there
7131680	7136800	They serve borscht and all this other kind of like pickled vegetables and um, they must think that you're russian
7136880	7139520	You they must you must walk through the doors and they go. Hello, brother
7139680	7144240	Sometimes i usually just don't the best way to appear russian lacks. I hope you're listening is to just not say anything
7144320	7148160	Just just to not that's the most russian thing that you can say is nothing exactly
7149680	7152320	That place is great and they have different saunas steam sauna
7152320	7157200	They have cold dunk and sometimes i'll just spend three four hours there. There's one in san francisco called archimedes banya
7157760	7162080	So sometimes that's an occasional thing now most people are trying to incorporate this into their daily life
7162160	7166560	And just like as we said for ice bath if you don't have access to ice or ice bath or cold tub
7166880	7168480	You do cold shower
7168480	7174320	Or longer cool baths with heat. I realize not everyone has access to a sauna hot baths do work
7174640	7180160	Now one thing about hot baths and hot sauna is they will nuke your sperm that is not nuke a nuke is a you know
7180560	7183600	Slang they will reduce viable sperm counts
7183600	7186960	So for males that are trying to reproduce, you know trying to create children
7187520	7190640	You want to be careful about hot baths and hot sauna too often
7190720	7194160	Some people will bring a cold pack in and put in their groin. You can't do that in a bath
7194960	7200880	But it's i mean sperm are maintained outside the body the testicles are maintained outside the body for a reason
7201120	7204800	Right the scrotum has varying elasticity in order to maintain temperature of the sperm
7204880	7209600	That's why that that's the the various effects that have been described are there on purpose
7210000	7211840	um, so
7211840	7215120	Why human evolution design this way? I don't know someone will say but
7215840	7217840	in any case
7217920	7222240	Unless you're trying to you know, and again the ice pack approach is interesting
7222480	7227520	Um, some people do that actually there's a kind of interesting relationship between cold and testosterone
7228160	7235920	And spermatogenesis. There's a little cottage industry out there. I think on amazon people will buy these gel pack underwear of
7236560	7238560	I think they're called snowballs
7238640	7243360	This is cooling the scrotum in order to try and increase spermatogenesis
7244000	7251120	Now i'm not aware of any data on this but people report anarcho data and have shown their blood work and stuff
7252240	7253680	that it
7253680	7259200	It actually works to increase testosterone levels. I am not aware of any period studies. I am not
7259680	7262560	I'm not I would not be sitting as comfortably as I am right now
7263360	7267440	But but I find this sort of amusing on the one hand and then on the other hand
7267440	7271920	I think what we're arriving at is some general principles of physiology, which are that light
7273120	7274640	exercise
7274640	7275680	temperature
7275680	7281440	Both heat and cold are all very powerful stimuli for creating hormonal and
7281920	7289200	Neuromodulator dopamine epinephrine effects and when you start to dig beneath the surface of all these protocols wim Hof breathing ice baths
7289520	7290800	sauna
7290800	7297280	Snowballs what you are finding is that these are all different stimuli to tap into these different neuromodulator systems, right?
7297760	7302400	You know sunlight on our skin and on and into our eyes organizes all these hormone cycles
7302400	7307280	There's a beautiful study out of israel just this last year pure reviewed studies showing that if men
7307840	7314080	And women are told to go outside and get a lot of sunlight exposure on their skin for 20 minutes a day three times a week
7314240	7319520	Testosterone and estrogen levels go up substantially feelings of desire and sexual passion go up
7320000	7322960	You know, there's a real effect of the summer months
7323600	7327200	For people and it's hormonal and that's because the skin is an endocrine organ
7327600	7328560	um
7328560	7333360	These effects shouldn't surprise us and some people hear these and they go
7333360	7339120	Oh, so basically you're just telling us to like get sunlight and exercise and eat well and you know and avoid bright lights at night
7339120	7342000	So that you can see but yeah, that's basically what we're saying
7342080	7345840	We're saying that because there's now substantial physiology to support that
7346320	7352000	There's nothing new in terms of the mechanisms the mechanisms haven't evolved in we believe hundreds of thousands of years
7352160	7353440	If not more
7353440	7358560	The ways to tap into these systems are many high intensity interval training. You're going to get increase in adrenaline
7359440	7365200	Yoga nidra meditation a nap. You're going to get increases in serotonin. So it's not trivial though
7365280	7367840	I want to be really clear these sorts of things
7368560	7373120	Are not trivial. They are exceedingly powerful because they tap into systems that we all harbor
7373440	7376560	So the beautiful thing is they work the first time and they work every time
7376880	7381120	And there are very few things you can say that about they work the first time and they work every time
7381360	7385360	And the reasons they work are now becoming clear to us through these more high quality studies
7385600	7389520	There's a lot of conversations at the moment around concerns for the
7390400	7392400	Average amount of testosterone that men have got
7392960	7396000	Eastergens in the water and stuff like that
7396720	7398720	Should we be worried? How worried should be?
7398880	7402320	So, um, I just recently came back from Copenhagen
7402320	7406720	I was there to give a talk for the lundbeck foundation and there was another talk that the lundbeck foundation put on
7406960	7408960	They do a great popular science series
7409040	7410000	um
7410000	7413760	Called coffee and cocktails. I'm not a drinker, but people it's so european
7413840	7416560	It's it's so different than over here. Was everybody smoking outside
7416560	7421440	No one was smoking but people would bring were allowed to bring in real glasses with ice in them
7421520	7425280	And yet the auditorium was silent. This was a big con is in the conser hall in Copenhagen
7425280	7428160	It's a very beautiful venue and you couldn't hear an ice cube
7428560	7432320	Chink the entire night and no clink clink clink no no chinking of the ice cubes
7432720	7436720	People were in there with their cocktails and enjoying enjoying science and earlier that week
7436960	7440560	There was a talk by dr. Sheena swan. She wrote a book called countdown
7441360	7444560	She went on Joe Rogan's podcast. I believe earlier last year
7445280	7450960	She talked about the decline of sperm counts from the 1930s until now and
7451600	7456320	Ties it in a very she's a serious researcher with national institutes of health grants, etc
7456720	7464320	Ties this to um the increasing presence of phthalates the most difficult word to pronounce in the english language besides ophthalmology
7465760	7467040	phthalates
7467040	7472720	That are present main present mainly in pesticides if you look at sperm counts and testosterone levels in
7473200	7475760	males in different areas of the united states they are
7476480	7480560	Significantly lower in areas where there's a lot of pesticide use in rural
7481200	7483440	Areas where there's a lot of farming and pesticides
7484240	7487600	very serious issue and in the offspring of mothers that
7488160	7489360	ingest
7489360	7490880	phthalates
7490880	7497440	There's this the anal genital distance is what they study in the lab the lot the anal genital distance literally the distance between
7497840	7503200	The base of the scrotum and the um and the anus in males is much greater than it is in
7503920	7507200	There's a word for that females don't have a scrotum obviously
7507440	7512480	So they measure from the base of the genitals to the base of the vagina to the to the anus in males
7512480	7515760	They go from the base of the scrotum depends on the study. Sometimes it's the top of the scrotum
7516560	7521280	You know, I always say, you know, uh, you always have to be careful when people are measuring anything related to genitalia
7521280	7523280	Because somebody's going to cheat in the measurement
7523680	7525440	so
7525440	7528000	So in any event, I don't know how they controlled for that
7528400	7534080	But she shows these remarkable pictures in mice and in humans of people that are exposed or mice that are exposed to phthalates
7534160	7537520	And basically males are showing the more female like pattern
7538400	7539120	of
7539120	7544800	Of anal genital distance when they're exposed to these phthalates in utero. Okay, this is not post birth
7544880	7548640	This is in utero. The mother's being exposed. It crosses the blood placental barrier
7549520	7553680	What's happening? Well, this is reducing sperm counts now. What can people do about this?
7553680	7560240	Well, first of all, there's this question of whether or not phthalates are having a similar effect after a child is brought into the world
7561120	7568880	One doesn't know but we do know and this is goes back to my early graduate work was on the effects of androgens like testosterone and dhT
7569360	7570800	on
7570800	7572960	different traits of brain and body
7572960	7574480	we know that
7574480	7582960	For instance, it just very briefly that during pregnancy the brain is organized male by way of believe it or not testosterone converted to estrogen
7583680	7589760	Through a process called aromatization, but the growth of the penis the fact that there even will be a penis etc
7589840	7597520	Is set by a testosterone called dhT dihydrotestosterone testosterone converted to dhT through five alpha reductase and on and on
7598960	7602720	That's an organizing effect on the system as they call it
7602720	7608160	But then there's an activating effect where during puberty the testes just start producing testosterone
7608240	7613200	Some is converted to dhT and the dhT is what creates the growth of the penis
7613680	7615440	Okay
7615440	7620240	In people that inject phthalates during puberty and in the post puberty years
7620800	7625440	It's conceivable that those phthalates could inhibit the activating effects of androgens
7625520	7630880	Not just what we call the organizing effects of androgens early in life. Oh, yeah. Why is this interesting and important?
7630960	7634640	Well sperm counts are definitely going down. Are they going down so much so that
7635200	7637200	People are incapable of reproducing
7637520	7642080	Probably not because you know as they told us in school it just takes one and indeed it just takes one sperm
7642080	7644800	But it is a probability. It's a numbers game, right?
7644960	7648160	The reason, you know, I people that take anabolic steroids unless they
7648880	7652640	Do things to offset the effect on their own testosterone and sperm production
7653120	7655440	sperm counts are down so the probability of
7655920	7661280	Of successful insemination is of the egg is reduced also. It's a numbers game
7661360	7666320	So it just takes one but having many improves the probability that the one will be able to fertilize
7667120	7669840	So the short answer is yes. I think it is
7670800	7675920	Very concerning now, which things should we be concerned about my understanding of the literature in here?
7675920	7677200	I'm not an
7677200	7683040	I'm now venturing to territory for which I am certainly not an expert is that things like plastics that have bpa's
7684320	7688560	May be a concern drinking water may be a concern, but the most serious
7689120	7690240	or
7690240	7693440	Enriched source of bpa's aren't things like printed receipts
7694400	7696880	I was out for dinner the other night
7697440	7699040	It was probably about a month and a half ago
7699440	7704400	And the server came over and I reached for the receipt and as I was going for it like this one of the girls
7704400	7706400	So I'd never met before she's a creator online
7706960	7709520	Hit my hand away. I was like, are you really going to touch that?
7710400	7715520	And this is the first time I've ever heard about this. This is legit. Yeah printed receipts are are a
7716320	7721280	A rich source of bpa's and topically that could come through the skin could go transdermally
7721440	7724160	I mean now you'd probably have to handle a lot of receipts
7724240	7727600	I mean, I don't think you're a check out cashier. Perhaps this would be the sort of thing
7727840	7734640	Definitely check out cashiers and listen it's going to vary. Some people are operating with a testosterone level and sperm count
7734720	7740320	That's already back on its heels so to speak some people have abundant testosterone and sperm
7740720	7743360	So it's really going to depend on the individual
7743920	7747440	I don't think people should get paranoid or delusional about any of this
7747600	7751040	But just don't start sleeping in a bed of receipts don't start sleeping in a bed of receipts
7751280	7754160	That's an interesting there are all sorts of jokes that could be made about that one
7755120	7757120	That I won't make but
7757440	7763840	There are also some other things like you know do a little bit of online research about phthalates and don't go to fringe sites
7763920	7769840	Go to dr. Shana swans website, right? I believe she's out bound Sinai or one of the other larger medical schools in new york
7770000	7774880	Go to her website. She's a legitimate researcher and see what's there. See what the sources of phthalates are pesticides
7774960	7777200	Does that mean you should only eat organic fruits and vegetables?
7777680	7781920	Maybe I don't know which pesticides people are using on which fruits and vegetables, right?
7781920	7783920	So there's some research that needs to be done
7784480	7785520	but
7785520	7789680	The moment we start talking this way and people start saying oh, wow, this is really like hippie science
7789840	7794720	This isn't hippie science. This is serious NIH funded researcher saying phthalates
7795200	7801680	Before birth can dramatically alter the trajectory of of the male's ability to make sperm and testosterone
7802320	7807120	Phthalates in puberty may be able to do that, but we know that that
7807840	7815600	Androgens in particular DHT and testosterone converted to estrogen have a powerful role in masculinizing the brain and body during those years
7816320	7820640	Why wouldn't people be you know do a half an hour of research online?
7821120	7825200	Or for instance the abundant data that melatonin suppresses pregnant
7825280	7830080	Excuse me suppresses puberty and yet people take melatonin like it was you know
7830480	7836000	Insane super physiological levels. Yeah, am I saying melatonin is going to suppress your puberty if you took it as a kid
7836000	7837280	You're messed up. No
7837280	7841440	And yet it's very easy to replace it with some of the healthier alternatives that are out there
7841760	7847200	So I think that one can have a thoughtfulness about this stuff and it's some and it's action oriented
7847520	7849680	Without having to really freak out about it
7849920	7857280	How do you think that creators like Derek from more plates more dates or greg do set us someone who's changed the way that the internet understands
7858240	7863600	Hormonal profiles and supplementation because since watching a lot of Derek stuff since he's become big on youtube
7863920	7867440	I have been much more considering the balance that's inside of my body
7867440	7871040	But I don't I don't think that that was super common before guys like him were around
7871120	7876880	Yeah, I look Derek's not a scientist by training, but he's done an immense service to the world
7877360	7881200	Because no one was talking about this stuff. It was talked about in bodybuilding circles
7882000	7884000	where they talked very openly
7884800	7886000	it was
7886000	7887440	Starting to emerge in
7887440	7892000	testosterone replacement therapy clinics and then mostly guys were doing this stuff and lying about it
7892720	7897760	They're doing it, but then they don't want to talk about actually kudos to joe rogan who years ago came out and said
7897920	7901760	Yeah, he decided to start doing trt and low dose of a testosterone
7901760	7906320	He's already successfully reproduced in this. Oh, you know, he brought it up and and you know
7907360	7909600	It's clear that this is becoming more common
7910000	7911920	Here's some of the general principles that I think
7912480	7916800	Forgive me Derek if I get this wrong in terms of what you believe because I never want to speak for anybody else
7916800	7918960	but my read of the science and the actual protocols
7919920	7921920	speak to the idea that
7922400	7924720	Many people do not need testosterone replacement
7925440	7928160	Young guys should really avoid doing anabolic steroids
7928160	7933040	They can really mess up their system not just physically not just for the ability to have kids later
7933360	7940880	But um lead to all sorts of sexual issues and sexual performance issues like there needs to be some medical incentive
7941280	7943280	right hypogonadism for instance
7944240	7945360	but
7945360	7951520	At the point where someone either has bank sperm or decides they don't want any more kids or is willing to do something like take hcg to maintain
7951760	7955760	testicular and uh function in spermatogenesis. It's very clear that
7956800	7959680	Going with the lowest in a doctor described, right?
7959680	7963760	I'm not talking about illicit use that the lowest possible dosage of testosterone
7964160	7970640	Therapy is going to be better than for instance taking 200 milligrams in a 1 mil injection
7970720	7971920	every two weeks
7971920	7976720	Right because you get these huge increases and then these troughs. So people are something that you've learned from Derek
7977200	7980480	Yes, and in talking with other people and I I'm no longer doing this
7981040	7985920	But I I did a run of it from 45 to 46 years old and nothing before that
7986240	7991200	Um, and I did it because I'm working on a on a book really that has a whole section on hormone therapies
7991200	7995280	I wanted to see what it was like. I'll tell you basically testosterone gives you more energy to work more
7995840	7999520	Um, if it's done appropriately, right? Maybe that's the the secret for legs
8000320	8004400	Maybe maybe home always just brimming maze brimming and I'll say when I went into it
8004480	8008400	My my levels were mid-range. They were fine. Hi to mid-range. They were kind of like sevens eights
8008400	8011840	But I was doing some supplementation to support that I've since gone back to that
8012320	8015680	It was funny when you say something on the internet people think that means it's forever, right?
8015920	8022000	It is possible to start and come off, right? So so what I've done and and so here's what's what's relevant here people are now
8022880	8027680	Spacing out, you know 30 milligrams on monday 30 milligrams on wednesday 30 milligrams on fridays
8027680	8031360	They kind of a low reasonable dose again. Talk to your doctor. These aren't recommended dosages
8031760	8036960	That's more typical. Another thing that's really important is that people have traditionally blocked estrogen by
8037520	8038640	increases
8038640	8043360	While doing this by taking an aromatase inhibitor nulvidex aromidex these kinds of things
8045040	8046080	That
8046080	8049040	almost often is a bad idea almost often because
8049840	8051920	Having enough estrogen around allows you to maintain
8052640	8054560	cognitive function
8054560	8060240	And libido a lot of guys think it's just you know, and it is true if estrogen is very high and testosterone is very low
8060240	8063920	It could libido can suffer but if testosterone is very high and estrogen is very low
8064400	8066400	libido can really suffer
8066400	8072880	So a lot of people who are crushing their estrogen realize that by coming off some of those drugs they feel far better
8073600	8080800	Far better far better. So most people I know that are doing this are taking low doses of testosterone semi frequently throughout the week
8081680	8083920	20 to 30 milligrams every other day or so
8084160	8086160	There's a lot of variation around this and then
8086720	8088720	Not doing anything to reduce
8089680	8094640	Aromatase or if they are taking very low doses not one milligram of aromidex
8094720	8099760	But maybe something like 0.1 milligrams of aromidex every third day or so again, not a recommendation
8099920	8104000	Talk to your doctor the the smarter clinics are starting to think about this and actually
8104240	8109680	I don't have any financial relationship to Derek or to Merrick health, which is his clinic
8109760	8113520	But from what I understand they do a very good job. I did help them design
8114080	8114800	a
8114800	8116240	herbal
8116240	8122000	Mostly herbal supplement for testosterone support for people who are not on TRT as things like tonga ali fidoge
8122240	8125440	But unbeknownst to most people I I've not made one penny
8125920	8131040	On that that was just based on a conversation of the research with him and dr. Kyle Gillette and a few other people. So
8132640	8139920	Estrogen can help maintain libido also can increase libido now. Here's something I learned that's really interesting from peter atia recently
8140720	8144720	Women as we know make both testosterone and estrogen and of course a bunch of other
8145280	8146880	hormones too
8146880	8150160	if they get their blood work back and you were to adjust the
8150880	8155200	Units that those hormones are measured in nanograms per deciliter in some cases
8155520	8159360	Pika grams per deciliter in other cases if you normalize them all to the same
8160320	8167120	Nanograms per deciliter you would find that a healthy woman has more testosterone than she does estrogen
8167520	8169520	That's right
8170720	8174400	I asked him this three times. I'm like, you're telling me that women have more testosterone
8174880	8182160	Circulating in them than estrogen. He said absolutely now this maybe there's a there's a caveat to that during some phase of the menstrual cycle, but
8183680	8187280	That does not mean that their toaster testosterone levels are higher than that of men
8188000	8194880	But this is remarkable, right? This means that these androgens testosterone and are doing interesting things in men
8195440	8200000	End in women and estrogen as we just described are doing really interesting things certainly in women
8200480	8206560	End in men. So this idea of more testosterone less estrogen good is always the case. That's simply false
8206880	8209680	You have to think about whether or not it's a man whether or not it's a woman whether or not
8210400	8212400	The goal is more less
8212560	8215520	Typically people aren't going for less libido, but I suppose it's possible
8215760	8219440	Some people out there with them. Some people might be highly distracted by an excessive libido
8219600	8223040	That's a different story, but and then of course DHT
8223120	8226000	So I think one of the things that Derek has really contributed to the world
8226320	8229200	And I think is important for people know that a lot of the drugs
8229760	8231760	That are used to treat hair loss
8232000	8236880	Finasteride propitia things like that block DHT receptors to hydrotestosterone
8237040	8243200	DHT is responsible for beard growth in the face and for balding male pattern baldness people because they want their hair
8243840	8247040	We'll take these drugs if they take it them in pill form
8247120	8252880	They're blocking DHT everywhere and they can experience severe defects in libido and sexual performance
8253360	8258160	Now before that choice between your hair and your erection for a lot of people it is right
8258240	8262640	I mean for now there are now topical things and Derek talks about all this kind of thing
8262640	8268240	They're top really really deep. He goes really deep into all this and what's interesting is, you know, we also can take a step back
8268320	8271840	And say like what's the landscape of health information that created this
8272240	8276240	Opportunity for a kid in his 20s. By the way, no one knows his last name
8276800	8278800	Very clever. No one knows his last name
8278880	8282960	Um, I'll play Derek. It's kind of an avatar of a human, right? Although he's real
8284160	8289440	What created this landscape for this guy to be able to get this information out there even though he's not a physician
8289440	8290320	He's not a scientist
8290320	8296160	And I think what it is is that he saw that there was all this information nested in these very niche communities
8296240	8298880	That most people don't want to look like a bodybuilder, right?
8299520	8303120	And yet what he did was he sort of normalized the discussion about hormones
8303680	8307040	He normalized the discussion about other things like dopamine and cortisol
8307520	8310560	Etc. And what's interesting is that science now
8311200	8317680	Is kind of following suit, you know 10 years ago a discussion about hormone therapies would never come up in the hallways of
8318160	8319920	discussions with my colleagues
8319920	8323920	Since doing an episode of the podcast on optimizing testosterone and estrogen
8324320	8328400	No fewer than 10 of I'm not going to name names, but these are serious scientists
8328480	8333360	And it's a mixture of men and women have approached me about like, hey, like what can one do in order to adjust
8333600	8335600	testosterone or estrogen levels is
8336080	8340400	Um estrogen therapy for menopause a useful thing when should one start now?
8340400	8343360	I'm not an endocrinologist so all I can do is point them in the way of information
8343440	8346000	But this is an important area and here's why
8346800	8353280	Hormones control neuromodulators like dopamine estrogen and so on and those neuromodulators powerfully influence our states of mind
8353600	8356560	So if your hormones are out of whack your neuromodulators are going to be out of whack
8356720	8358880	Typically the treatment for depression would be to go in and just
8359440	8364000	Give a serotonin reuptake inhibitor or well butron type dopamine thing and that has its use
8364400	8366160	But I love this
8366160	8370960	trend now not towards hormone therapy necessarily but just toward a thinking a mindset of
8371360	8377680	How deep in the layers of my biology can I go to create these sort of waves of health that rise up to the level of
8378640	8380160	ability to focus
8380240	8384480	And etc for so many years it's all been attacked at the surface kind of the waves
8385120	8389440	On the surface of the ocean and yet there's this like we're now talking about the deep tectonic plates
8389920	8392720	Movements that are affecting all that in any case
8393600	8397360	Around about 30 years ago. You took a real hard turn in life
8397440	8402880	It seemed like you drastically altered the trajectory that you were moving on for quite a while and I'm very interested
8403520	8404800	in how
8404800	8410400	Anybody manages to make severe life changes like that. I think that many people can
8411040	8415280	They believe that they have control over maybe their daily habits and little things here and there
8415680	8421200	But they don't have huge global control over their life direction. Certainly not in the way
8421920	8423920	that they want
8424320	8426160	Reflecting on that now
8426160	8432480	Does it almost surprise you the sort of the ability that you have to be able to change that direction? It seems so unbelievably rare
8433120	8436080	Uh, right. So it um, I don't know
8436560	8439520	Um, I like to think everybody harbors it inside themselves
8439760	8444640	I I can say without going into the whole backstory because I've done it before I mean at at 19
8444720	8449680	I basically just looked at myself and decided that I was a loser, right?
8449920	8455280	I mean, I was able bodied which was helpful. I had a mind that could remember things which was helpful
8456080	8458080	I was interested in a few things
8458160	8461680	But none of those things were setting me up for career or ongoing progress
8461760	8467040	And I had a lot of maladaptive behaviors, right at the time I was getting involved in fighting
8467120	8472160	I just I just didn't I wasn't completing my schoolwork. I was just really in a bad place
8472720	8475760	And it was really fear and desperation
8476400	8478240	mostly fear
8478240	8480240	That inspired the the switch
8482480	8485040	Along the way and I haven't talked about this publicly
8485440	8489200	You know to any great extent but along the way I hit numerous roadblocks again and again
8489280	8494400	Sometimes they were situational like people close to me dying and the grief that came with that sometimes it was my own
8494880	8500080	Kind of um feeling like I was getting pulled back toward a state of mind that wasn't healthy for me
8500640	8503200	Uh and so on but I think what I've
8504000	8505440	been good at
8505440	8508080	at least good at not great at but at least good at is
8509040	8510560	finding
8510560	8514000	Really good mentors that would allow me to get to the next
8514640	8516640	node of the next milestone
8517200	8520080	And I should say that some of those mentors were real people
8520800	8523120	That I I didn't say can you be my mentor?
8524000	8526000	not that that would be a bad thing but
8526080	8529040	Really tried to model my behavior after people that I respected
8529680	8535520	And sometimes those mentors were people that I didn't know at all. I mean, I'll just say this right now
8535600	8540960	I I mean, I'm an embarrassment by saying that but you know, I was a junior professor meaning before I got tenure
8541520	8543040	running a lab
8543040	8545040	I had a bulldog puppy
8545360	8549600	A laboratory and a home for the first time in my life and feeling very very
8550240	8552240	Overwhelmed and distraught and I made
8552960	8554960	Many of the things that I heard
8556000	8558000	Tim Ferriss say
8558240	8562160	Sort of central to my way of doing things. I didn't go four hours of work a week
8562480	8565920	But I did start to get extreme about organizing my schedule
8565920	8569840	So he was a big influence on you Tim huge huge and and I know Tim a little bit
8569840	8573040	We have some common friends and I feel very fortunate that now we're in touch because
8573440	8576640	Gone on his podcast and gotten to know one another but just huge
8576720	8582880	I mean like there were no organizational forces in my life for me at that time that could help me navigate through this landscape of
8583280	8586400	You know, I'd never been a professor before I had
8586960	8590800	Taught it now those many years ago now, but um, I knew how to do science
8590800	8596080	I felt confident in my ability to take an empty room and a budget and create by the right equipment and do the experiments higher
8596080	8598080	The people I had no problem with that
8598240	8599840	but how to
8599840	8602880	regulate my time and my energy and how to
8604640	8606160	Communicate with people
8606160	8610240	I mean he had these like little things that I don't like the word hacks. I hate it because hacks are
8610880	8614560	Implies that you're using something for a purpose that it wasn't intended for that's a hack
8614880	8617200	But he had things like instead of asking people
8618800	8623280	You know like what's up when they come in your office asking them, you know, what specifically, you know, what can I do for you?
8623280	8624480	Like what do you need?
8624560	8630240	Right really cutting to the chase because time became a valuable resource little things like that tiny things on the fit on the surface
8630400	8633760	That translate into huge conversion in terms of time and energy
8634160	8635200	um
8635200	8638880	And even just setting aside some savings and things I it's not that I'm not
8639440	8640480	Dumb about money
8640480	8644320	But I wasn't I've never really taken the time to think about how I was going to invest money or do anything
8644320	8649520	So tim did a tremendous service for for me without realizing it and I've thanked him now a million times
8649600	8652400	I'm gonna thank him a million times. I'm thanking thank you tim. I'm thanking you again
8652800	8655760	Things like that. So it's selecting mentors then eventually
8656320	8660560	When it came time to start podcasting. I mean lex whether or not he knows or not, you know, just thinking
8660640	8663520	Oh, here's another guy who's a he's a scientist. He's mit
8664080	8669120	The fact he always wore that suit and I'm gonna copy him and just always wear the same thing because I don't have to take
8669440	8672160	Guesswork I can take the guesswork out of it. There were little things that
8672800	8676560	were super deliberate that just saved me time and energy and I think that
8677440	8681680	That's helped me along the way and then the other thing is I have really tried to adopt this idea that
8683040	8685040	When it's inevitable
8685120	8688560	And it will inevitably arrive that stress grows us
8689120	8693360	That it really sharpens decision making it really sharpens decision making and you know
8693360	8695680	If you have a very stressful event and then you recover from it
8695760	8701120	The worst thing to do is just go and keep going you need to take some time and reflect about what led into that
8701600	8708640	So I think I'm very good at leveraging fear into positive change if I really think about most of the major shifts in my life it was
8709440	8715520	I'm scared as hell to remain in this situation and I'm very good at broadcasting fear into my future
8716000	8719520	Uh, you know, if I've ever been in a bad relationship, it was
8720400	8722400	Clearly if I stayed in it couldn't have been so bad
8722960	8724960	That I felt like I had to leave so I would
8725360	8728800	Broadcast and project, you know, how horrible it would be for my future children
8729120	8735120	And I might even build that up a little bit my system now one could say well, maybe you could have navigated it successfully
8735520	8741520	I'm better at projecting fear into my future and that has led me to make I think better and better decisions over time
8741920	8744800	That's it. How much of the old andrew
8745440	8746640	still
8746640	8750800	Rises to the surface today. I know that the music that you tend to listen to when you're training is
8751440	8755920	Still pretty punky and when I work. Yeah, I mean I have two very polarized versions of music
8756000	8759440	I do love, you know, I love bob dillon. I love joe strummer acoustic
8759520	8761760	I like I you know, I like melodic music too
8762160	8767440	But yeah, I'm listening to rants. It's diff little fingers. I mean, I'm I mean, I was the first ever gig I went to
8767840	8773760	Siff little fingers. I'm just I've never actually seen them play live. I'm a huge stiff little fingers fan. Huge stiff little fingers fan
8774160	8775280	um
8775280	8779200	Huge against me fan huge rancid fan. I mean, you know for people that
8779680	8783920	Um of my generation, they probably remember it people were younger probably think oh, that's all 90s stuff
8784000	8785520	But a lot to me
8785520	8789040	I mean, I have huge collections of like 80s and 90s music 70s music
8789440	8794400	Second wave punk third wave punk. I collect a ton of that stuff. I love it. I mean how much of me still exists
8794880	8796480	I believe that
8796480	8801840	We are all born fundamentally with some gift and it's our job to reveal that gift to ourselves
8801840	8808160	And you know, here I'm I want to thoroughly acknowledge someone else who's been a great mentor without ever meeting him as a robert green
8808160	8811760	I think is a is a one fantastic guy fantastic. I've never met you robert
8811760	8815280	But I'd love to meet I mean, it's one of these things where I used to put you in touch
8815280	8816640	He's been on the show twice amazing
8816640	8820960	I used to suggest the book mastery to to graduate students and to undergraduates like, you know
8821040	8823280	Learn the this process of finding a mentor
8823680	8824880	um
8824880	8830400	And in science we have natural mentors graduate advisors and postdoc advisors and I I made sure I will say this
8830400	8835920	I should have said this earlier when a mentor has sort of arrived in my life either virtually or in reality
8836000	8839600	I make the most of that relationship. I really nurture those relationships
8839760	8843200	I mean, I still go to visit the children of my dead graduates
8843760	8844960	advisor
8844960	8848560	Kids, you know, because I care so I mean these are like these people are like family to me
8848800	8852080	How much of it still exists? Well, the energy has always been the same
8852160	8855280	The energy is I have an absolute obsession from day one
8855840	8860640	This maybe was what I was kind of born with to I like to learn things and share them with the world
8861120	8867760	I was six years old giving lectures on monday after reading about medieval weapons or, you know, goldfish biology
8868000	8871520	In class and when my parents thought I was crazy and they took me a psychiatrist
8871520	8876240	And I'm like, no, he just really likes learning and really likes telling people about that about what he learns
8877280	8878560	so
8878560	8881680	And I had a little bit of an underlying Tourette's when I was younger I had a grunting tick
8882560	8887040	I had a look and when I'm tired it sometimes emerges a little bit and for me learning and kind of seeking
8887520	8889520	kind of calms that somehow
8890000	8892000	as does training
8892000	8896240	As is skateboarding I did boxing of course head damage isn't good. So I stopped boxing but
8897200	8902400	That's always been in me. That's how I'm that's how my nervous system kind of tilts left in that way
8904000	8905840	The energy
8905840	8908960	I would say I'm able to turn the dial
8909280	8913440	I'm able to tap into kind of some old hurts and angers as fuel
8913520	8919200	But I really try and orient towards things in a very Lex Friedman ish way from a place of like show them love
8919360	8923360	Show them show them do things from a place of love because it's a more continual resource
8924160	8928320	Really believe it's this dopamine epinephrine cycle positive feedback cycle. I really do
8929120	8931120	And so that's all there
8932400	8937840	You know, I have pretty much eaten the same way I have since college. I really I haven't really changed the way
8937840	8940720	I eat that much. I mean, I probably ate more junk every once in a while
8940800	8945040	I scream and pizza and stuff and now I have less of an appetite for but I still am the same
8945040	8947040	I still train every other day. I um
8947600	8951920	I love music. I love movies. I love nature. I love the flora and fauna of life
8951920	8956080	I mean, I have this kind of obsession with fish tanks freshwater fish tanks. I love
8957920	8965040	And listen, I my ex-girlfriend is a she's a florist. I I developed a love of flowers, you know in those years
8965760	8967760	I love, you know, I
8968000	8971120	I'm probably the one guy who was like wandering around in college
8971120	8976480	I would go to these like orchid festivals and some of them look like aliens and I just I just love learning
8976960	8980240	and I love digesting novel information and
8980240	8981360	um
8981360	8982640	And now
8982640	8986800	You know, I have to say I'm in a place where the people that I'm closest to I mean
8986800	8990400	Thankfully really kind of support that and I can indulge it through podcasting
8990480	8995440	It's so lovely now that the environment of curiosity. I think that podcasts and and youtube and
8996080	8997680	creators have
8997680	9000800	Engended it's so cool. You know the the fact that you get to
9001360	9005120	Find out about something that you really care that you would have done right you would have done it
9005520	9009040	For free without anybody else knowing about it right and then somehow
9009680	9016960	Telling other people the thing that you found out in this version of the simulation is called a job or a pursuit or something
9016960	9019440	It's it's wild another thing
9020080	9023360	That has carried over from your youth or your tattoos
9024080	9026080	Which I've heard you talk about
9026080	9028080	But never seen
9028320	9031520	What's your relationship with your tattoos and why is no one ever seen them? Yeah
9031760	9035200	Um, yeah, actually it was tim ferris that outed me on this one
9035200	9038000	He was like I found a picture on the internet with you in full sleeves
9038400	9039360	um
9039360	9044640	Yeah, you know, I believe that you know tattoos are I mean this has come as no surprise or a
9045440	9050800	literal expression of what we feel on the inside and you know, I and I'm not recommending this kids don't do this
9050800	9056160	I started getting tattooed really young. How are you about 14? I got my first tattoo. No way. We did them ourselves
9056720	9058720	With india your first one is yourself. Please don't no
9059280	9064000	Please no one do this india ink and a needle and um, we used to do these is really bad
9064080	9070160	They're called nicknack tattoos or we kind of would do this at home. Don't do it. It's really bad to get bad infections. They're ugly. They they
9071440	9073440	Blur they bleed that's not good
9073520	9078720	Um, yeah, I started getting tattooed. I when I was a kid and growing up skateboarding in the punk rock scene
9078720	9082480	There were these guys that um in the town where I lived they called themselves the yatsi guys
9082480	9085760	I don't know why I don't know what that was about, but they all had full sleeves
9086160	9089360	And they were super nice guys and they were all into skateboarding and
9090000	9094560	You know and vehicles and I just looked up to these guys. I thought like someday. I want full sleeves
9095040	9096240	I
9096240	9101600	Yeah, I've got full sleeves. I'm basically like neck to neck to wrists. So chest piece as well. Yeah, but yeah
9102560	9105920	Back's covered. Yeah, nothing on my legs. Nothing on my stomach ribs. Yeah
9106480	9110880	tops of my tops of my shoulders and um, I got a big picture of costello my dog back there
9110880	9114400	I've got a picture of his paw back there. I've got a picture of another dog used to have um
9114880	9118080	There's still some space for a few things. There's some things very personal to me
9118480	9123280	Um, is that the reason that you prefer not to show them? Yeah, you know, I think that there are a couple reasons
9123360	9125440	I'll just be clear as to why first of all
9126160	9131680	When I show up to podcast it's the same way I show up to lecture in the classroom auditorium
9132320	9133760	and I
9133760	9139040	Swear on my life. This is my mindset and this is my mantra when I do it. I'm there to teach. It's not about me
9139120	9141840	It's about a student. It's about the people learning
9142560	9145200	I don't want it ever to be about me. I don't want the focus to be on me
9145200	9147200	I mean, obviously I'm the voice and the person talking
9147680	9152800	But I really want people to internalize the information and I do think that the tattoos because they have nothing to do with
9152800	9155840	The information are a distraction. They're just a distraction
9156240	9161600	I don't know it would sort of like be wearing like a bright yellow shirt or something. It's not my style
9161920	9165120	I prefer to kind of make myself disappear as much as I can
9165600	9167600	Um and let the information come forward
9167920	9172480	That's you know, even when I gave scientific lectures, which I still do of course for my my professor job
9173200	9176960	I generally liked the room to be pretty dark and I wanted the light to be on the data on the slides
9177120	9180080	I was happy to be the voice, but I want people thinking about the data
9180640	9185360	So podcasting is a little different to come through as a voice or on youtube a voice in an image, but
9186080	9188160	I really prefer that it not be about me now
9188160	9193680	There's a human element too and I think things have changed a lot when I was growing up tattoos were not accepted
9194000	9197200	There are many work environments where if you have for instance
9197840	9198880	Where
9198880	9204640	People prefer that they're surgeon or their doctor not have tattoos some people might prefer their surgeon or doctor have tattoos
9204720	9206720	When I was growing up if you had a
9207360	9208000	I never had one
9208000	9212320	But if someone had a nose ring they had to cover it up with a band-aid or take it out if they worked at the coffee shop
9212560	9218160	Remember that you probably don't you're probably young enough or the or eyebrow ring think trends have changed right things have changed
9218560	9221920	And I'm kind of old school because I'm kind of old now 46
9222720	9229280	And the etiquette for me has always been to you know, and this is lex does this too is I I personally
9230000	9235520	Behind that if I can just show up as formal and consistent as possible that people will at least know that I'm taking them seriously
9235520	9238640	So I don't really do it for me. I pretty much do it for the audience
9240240	9246240	And also none of the tattoos are like that interesting. It's my dog. I really like raptors. I've got a bunch of birds
9246240	9250960	I've got I mean I have all sorts of different things like raptors like the dinosaur. No raptors like
9251760	9256400	Red-tailed hawks and blue, you know, I like birds and I had either dinosaurs or trucks
9257120	9260080	You know, you really need to love four raptors. No, no no four raptor
9260080	9263680	I drive I drive a Toyota four-runner and I love it. I've got one truck and I love that thing
9264240	9265600	Although gas for right now
9265600	9269280	I mean it's you kind of got a wonder about having a gas-driven vehicle like a four-runner
9269760	9273360	In any case, yeah, the tattoo thing I would say for for younger people coming up
9273360	9276320	Just be aware that you can't control other people's perceptions either
9276640	9280160	And so, you know, I always made it a point that I didn't want things on my knuckles
9280160	9282960	I didn't want them on my hands. I didn't want them on my neck. I didn't want them on my face
9283040	9289760	Do I judge people when they have them? No, but do I want them for me? No, I also think that this is very neuroscience-y
9290400	9293200	As a neuroscientist that we have dedicated brain areas called fusiform
9293760	9297680	Gyrus it's a face area that's dedicated to the processing of faces
9298080	9303520	Even if I just put two dots and a line in between them on a piece of paper you see that as a face
9304480	9311200	When one puts a tattoo on their throat or on their face, it actually changes the way that the face is perceived, right?
9311360	9316720	I mean it almost looks like another mouth there, right? It's a very different look. It's it can be a little bit jarring
9316960	9322320	I'm not saying one shouldn't have it, but it can be a little bit jarring. It's it changes the look of the person forever
9322640	9324880	It's not just that it's above the neckline
9325040	9329680	It's that it kind of competes with the processing of their face in its normal way
9330080	9334000	And so for me whenever I see somebody with a throat tattoo or a face tattoo
9334240	9339120	Sort of like it's hard to kind of orient around that and I think there's some biology to
9339840	9342800	To that relates to that but like when it comes down to it
9342800	9346640	I mean people need to be individuals and live their life the way they want to live their life
9347200	9350720	I've also never been that much of an iconoclast. I've not
9351280	9357120	You know, I grew up in the punk rock thing. Um, you know, I hate in-group out-group stuff
9357120	9361200	I always had friends from a lot of different, you know friends are jocks and hippies and punk rockers and
9361680	9365920	You know straight and gay and like I don't care as long as people are living their best life
9366000	9371680	And they're not harming anybody like I'm like great. Go for it. I I'm very laid back in that way
9372160	9374160	Of course if people are harming other people
9374480	9378000	Then I believe that like a little bit less liberty and independent freedom
9378000	9382320	I mean liberty is you know, one of the highest things though, you know for me so
9382640	9383760	I
9383760	9389920	But I don't tend to I don't consider myself a very judgmental person but you can't always control the perceptions of others
9389920	9394800	So I would just think people should be thoughtful about what they want to accomplish in life in terms of a life mission
9394880	9398240	And just ask whether or not some of the permanent cosmetic changes
9398240	9403040	They might make might might align with compete with or be neutral for those life missions
9403360	9408480	My life mission is very simple. I want to teach people the beauty and the utility of biology. I'm going to do that today
9408560	9413600	I'm going to do that until I take my last breath in one form or another because that's what excites me
9413600	9417280	And that's like what keeps the dopamine cranking dude. Let's bring this one home
9417360	9423120	Look, I really really appreciate you the work that you've done the fact that I feel like I have a lot more agency over my life because
9424480	9428480	I understand that my internal processes are something that I can influence
9428560	9433520	You know the first time that I heard you say that you cannot control the mind with the mind a lot of different things clicked for me
9433520	9437440	So I'm very glad that Lex bullied you or convinced you to start doing your show
9437680	9442480	And uh, yeah, I'm looking forward to hearing a lot more of what you've got to do in the future
9442800	9445600	Well, thanks so much and thanks for bringing me on today. Obviously
9446240	9448240	We've been in touch and I
9449040	9453520	Align with you and I feel resonance along the life as a podcaster, right?
9453760	9455520	But also we've had a chance to interact a few times
9455600	9460400	I'm looking forward to more because I think what you're doing bringing knowledge to the world is is so important
9460400	9463200	And I so appreciate your your questions and learning from you
9463280	9466240	I'm also going to get these resources about the expectation effect and the rest
9466240	9469280	I've been taking notes here because I I'm obsessed with learning
9469280	9473840	So why should people go people want to make sure that they they listen to more watch more follow more of your stuff
9473840	9477360	Where should they go? Thanks for asking. Yeah, it's very straightforward. It's huberman lab
9477920	9481360	Is the podcast and it's all the standard places youtube apple spotify, etc
9481680	9483280	Huberman lab on twitter
9483280	9486560	Huberman lab on instagram and the twitter and instagram mainly are short content
9486640	9492240	I used to do a lot more hand drawings and I think you're doing instagram pretty much as well as any science communicator that i've seen
9492480	9496400	I don't think there's anyone else that's optimized it better than that. Thanks right now. Thanks
9496400	9501200	Yeah, I try and answer comments and respond to things and any of those three places and we have a website
9501200	9502960	Which is huberman lab dot com
9502960	9506480	There where all the podcast episodes are linked salt things in all formats
9506480	9511440	We have a newsletter and you know people can peruse that if they want it's all I should say zero cost to access
9511840	9516000	So that's been a major goal that we've stuck to which is to just we don't put anything behind a paywall
9516080	9521280	The information that's there is the information that anyone can access dude. I appreciate you. Let's go and get hot and cold
