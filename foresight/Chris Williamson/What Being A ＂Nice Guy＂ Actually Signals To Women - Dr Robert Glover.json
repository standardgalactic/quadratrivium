{"text": " What's wrong with being a nice guy? What's wrong with being a nice guy? That's that's a good question You know when I put out a book called no more. Mr. Nice guy I'm sure a lot of people picked it up that wait a minute There's already enough not nice guys out there why somebody write a book teaching men how to be not nice but The problem with being a nice guy just a quick elevator pitch is that a nice guy is a guy who? Inaccurately internalized the belief system every young age. I'm not okay just as I am So he's trying to do two things very unconsciously usually one has become what he thinks Everybody else wants him to be so he'll be liked and loved and get his needs met and get laid hopefully regularly and hide anything about himself that might get a negative reaction from people Hiding his needs his wants and sexuality so while he's trying to get laid. He's hiding his sexuality so a core problem with nice guy syndrome is nice guys tend to be un Unauthentic There there there's not a real them there. They're trying to become something hide something and That tends to make them fairly dishonest untrustworthy Frustrated resentful passive aggressive A whole list of traits that can go along and and mainly it prevents and I'm a recovering nice guy So I'm not speaking down to anybody, you know It keeps us from just being ourselves living up for our full potential Having what we want in life having a good time and so just a lot of baggage comes along with it What are the component parts of being a nice guy? What are the traits that they embody or project? Worry what you'll recognize most often and what listeners may recognize in themselves Core tendencies often people pleasing Seeking external validation and and for men usually that seeking validation from women even even gay guys I find tend to do it even if they don't plan on having sex with the women they We can talk more about this, but we're We've learned from birth to please women. So there's that people pleasing that external validation I'm Failing to live up to one's full potential a basic court is honesty, you know thinking, you know, I'm a good guy I'm pretty honest. I always laugh when men tell me they're pretty honest. I say that's actually a contradiction of terms You're honest or you're not And And just you know for most nice guys, there's just a certain dull Depression that they live with just thinking, you know, I should be happy. I should be getting what I want I should be getting love. I should I should but I'm not and I don't know why not and So there's there's a lot of characteristics, but the core piece you'll see the most often is that people pleasing seeking of external validation Who is the Prototypical nice guy avatar like just describe him for me He's you know He's just just that guy that's you know walking through life trying to make everybody happy Try not to do anything wrong. Don't want to fuck anything up doesn't want to piss anybody off Goes along to get along, you know, we've heard that, you know, happy wife happy life If I just make everybody happy Everything's good. I have a course that I've taught for a number of years called nice guys don't finish last They rot in middle management. So he's good But you know, he doesn't excel he doesn't stand out because standing out is actually really scary for nice guys It's too much attention. It's too much expectation So, you know, when I started working with nice guys 30 years ago Most of the men I worked with, you know, probably were around my age. I was in my early 30s at that time and So there's a lot of baby Baby boom generation guys, you know, they they were trying to be different than their fathers the World War two, you know, man They were in that protest generation against Vietnam growing their hair out getting in touch with their feminine side And so a lot of the men I worked with, you know, kind of grew up in that era But I've been doing this for a while. And so, you know, my son's 38 for example So, you know, I worked with Millennials Millennials men younger than that and what's funny is Whereas my generation a lot of the men Kind of attribute part of their nice guy stuff to well, my dad wasn't there or you know, my parents divorced Oh, you know, he worked all the time or he's an alcoholic Nowadays I hear a lot of men say, oh, my dad was a nice guy and and about all he taught me about life was don't piss off your mother And and because he was walking around eggshells trying not to piss off my mother So, you know, I've seen that whole range all the way from the guys that were reacting to, you know, the asshole Patriarchal father to now the guys that were raised by nice guys and they don't know any other way of being It's like one generation had the tyrant and the other generation had the compliant That's a good way to put it. That's nice. Yeah, the tyrant the compliant Yeah, it was but here's the interesting thing, right? And it's so fascinating that you had one generation that was Rebelling in their niceness Even if that niceness isn't that nice. Yeah, and then another generation That was following in their niceness. So there seems to be a particular stickiness to niceness if Tyrants that are emotionally unavailable and not nice are able to create nice guys and nice Fathers are also big trouble What's why is it so prevalent? What is what is this pull? Are we as men are we inculcating or absorbing something from the world? Is this the way that we were raised by mom and dad is the What's the gen what's the origin? What's the genesis the seed of this? That's a good question, of course and this course what every nice guy wants. Well, how do I get to be this way? You know who cursed me with this. Yeah I I quickly learned when I started working with nice guys again 30 years ago that there is no one You know one size fit all how you how you got to be a nice guy. I thought there was it first. I thought they're all like me, you know Disconnected from their father in some significant way, you know significantly raised by their mother trying to please their mom and And I thought well that that explains it all but it didn't and There's so many pieces that go into a lot of men I work with that identifies being nice guys I think part of it's their temperament part of it's just they're easy going, you know My my mother would often say in adulthood to women. I was dating. Oh Bobby never did like conflict and I'm thinking Thanks mom, you know what are you telling these women be nice to my son? Don't be mean to him, but I'm also thinking who does like conflict, you know I do tend to marry women who like to fight but I for me It's kind of like, you know, I can't can't can't you know instead of us you doing something that starts a fight I say to them can't I just yell at you a little bit you cry and then I hold you in that really what you know This is all about anyway, and my wife always say no, it doesn't countless. You're really mad at me So I don't like conflict in particular. So that's my temperament Disposition that many of the nice guys will have the raw materials of someone that's a little bit Yeah, part of my nature But but that's just kind of one category of nice guy the other one that that I bumped into I call often those I'm so good nice guy. He's the guy that just always did everything right no matter what, you know But the other side I talk about you know one mr. Nice guy is what I called. I'm so bad nice guy This is the one that you know, maybe start rebelling at an early age Maybe at 80 HD undiagnosed, you know, he's always impulsive getting in trouble You know not following through getting yelled at getting punished starts doing drugs and alcohol at 14 You know drops out of school and then maybe at some point as a come to jesus moment Religion military gets married as a kid Death in the family. He goes I got I got to quit, you know self-destructing. I got a I got to be nicer So there's that kind of nice guy as well. So it's a different temperament than the than the other One of the pieces, you know, there's so many pieces that go into this but to answer your question, how do we What's the stickiness part? Again, I think a real core piece that I see with so many nice guys is this attempt to please women and I I was talking to somebody the other day it makes perfect sense because if you think about it We're all born to a woman our earliest caregiver. It is not mom. It's probably some other woman So from the time we're born our very survival our sustenance our okayness Depends on a woman and probably us getting along with that woman. That's probably a good thing, right? And so that's really normal that the our first experiences are how to how to negotiate a relationship with a woman to make that Big powerful holds our our life in her hands Person how to make sure that's okay And I don't know about in the uk but when I was growing up in Seattle. I had one male teacher Before I got to junior high there's four times more female fighter pilots in the us air force by percentage Then there are male kindergarten teachers There you go. You've done your research so so I had one teacher So that means just to learn how to get from second to third grade not only had to learn my reading writing and arithmetic How to please a woman. Okay, all of that's fine. There's there's nothing inherently wrong with that I think that's actually probably the way it's always been But historically I mean if we go back even two or three generations But if you go through most of human history Out of about age 12 The men came into the boys life took him You know from the women took him out had a masculine initiation taught him how to get comfortable being uncomfortable How to face his fear how to live in the scary world of the masculine And therefore and spent most of his time from them on out with men in the masculine And and so he got he moved through that what do I have to do to please a woman? So I think that's a really normal thing that to try to please women The survival for for every young boy But what was missing is there's no initiation to teach them How to how to go face their fears in the scary world with the masculine and quit seeking the approval and validation of women Because there's this really interesting paradox that I took me years to find out and you know a lot of men I work with takes You know, it's a big surprise is all Pursuing women and trying to please them doesn't make them interested in you. It doesn't make them like you It doesn't make them want to have sex with you. No, it actually doesn't Actually not trying to please women tends to make a guy more interesting to women in general That's a big paradox for a lot of the men I work with and it was for me You mean I mean all this Me listening and talk about their problems me trying to be different than the jerks they complain about me repressing my sexuality So it's not like I just want that one thing from them Oh, you know all that doesn't make them interested in me. No, it doesn't actually But they do seem to be drawn and attracted to the guy who's comfortable in his own skin Living a life, you know on his terms connected with men Putting a big dent in the universe that is really attractive But there's no note. How do I get this woman's approval involved in that whole mix? What are the covert contracts? Oh, I'm glad yes that That's um, that's my favorite part. I'm no more mr. Nice guy and I know Many men read it say robert. That is the biggest takeaway The covert contracts are unspoken often unconscious agreements that the nice guy has With everything that's not him with the world with god with women, you know, which is how things work and In the book I I I'm a little bit general, but I've broken it down to three specific covert contracts that nice guys have They're all if then uh, if I do this then this will happen. They they all are basically manipulative They all have strings attached and often the nice guy isn't aware of them and nobody else is either So covert contract number one If I'm a good guy, I will be liked and loved and get my and and Going back to and the women I'm trying to impress will want to be with me and have sex with me So if I'm good, I'll be liked and loved Number two if I meet everybody else's needs without them having to ask Then they will meet my needs without me having to ask now Unfortunately, nobody else knows this contract exists So they don't know they're supposed to be reading our minds and figure out what we want like we're trying to do for them Another core problem with this is that nice guys are actually really terrible receivers. We're not good at letting people do force We're not good at giving to ourselves. So that's covert contract number two covert contract number three Is if I do everything right, then I will have a smooth problem free world So it's kind of a peter panish kind of thing, you know, I I do everything right? I'm a good guy but unfortunately We're the player the referee the scorekeeper and we got the big scoreboard. I've done everything right How come this stuff still isn't going the way it's supposed to go in my life So nice guys are walking around these covert contracts and you ask, you know, what are What what what's the core characteristic of a nice guy? One of them is is that they're often really resentful You know, they might say well, I'm kind of bugger. I'm kind of frustrating But the really resentful not an arrangement because I've been doing this. I've been doing it right. I've been following the rules I've been, you know, being the good guy. I've been meeting your needs. I've been, you know, following all the rules You know, how come I'm wins at my turn How come I'm not getting all the all the stuff that I thought I would and that leads to a lot of resentments And that's one way I can tell I tell nice guys They well, how do I know if I'm if I'm using covert contracts and I'll go You'll know because you're walking around resentful and pissed off either because you didn't get back In turn or you didn't get appreciated for for all that that you did I heard somebody share a quote the other day that I really liked to me is another really nice way of putting covert contracts And this I guess was from Neil Strauss and he says Un unspoken expectations expectations are premeditated resentment. Isn't that that that is what happens with covert contracts phenomenal by him? Yeah that So the frustration and the resentfulness that's coming from offering to the world something that you think should be Universally liked you have that there is there's no way that anybody could be Offended by what I'm doing. I'm following the rules. I'm offering the world lots whilst asking for nothing in return and The fact that not asking for something in return results and you getting nothing in return Finding how that works. I don't know But it's I suppose this as well plays into the dishonesty bit and it's so I understand I would say that I'm I'm very much in nice guy category Very much a people pleaser My temperament is to be averse to conflict as well I've made a dent in many ways, but it's been done It's been done by weaving my way through avoiding much of the the conflict That that I would maybe need to So I suppose I can be at least in some regards a A paragon or like a a a role model for the successful nice guy in in many ways and me too You know, again, I don't like conflict, but you know, I you know, I'm doing okay There's something I always felt I always felt the fact that I wasn't like my go-to isn't typically Aggression that's not what I lean into Um Despite the fact I've got a background of fighting and and doing other things and physical training and stuff like that I always felt like it emasculated me The fact that there was something more heroic About being someone that was quick to anger, you know, there was something kind of typically masculine about that and I think I was Not strong enough to say ashamed, but it felt it it didn't feel as grand to be someone who Would be I know that there's an ability in you know being under control having your emotions under control um, but there's also a degree of Fragility, I think that you can sometimes feel with that also Well, let me give a one way to maybe look at the model and see if it fits what you're saying Is that when I was writing no more mr. Nice guy I really focused a lot on shame being a core foundation of a nice guy syndrome that internalized belief I'm not okay and Inaccurately internalized belief from our earliest life experience a few weeks old few few months old by the time I finished writing the book and it was you know Getting ready to be published. I by that time. I'd really come to also see that anxiety plays Maybe an equally significant role in nice guy syndrome. So where everything that nice guys are doing is trying to manage that sense of shame I'm not okay. I'm unlovable. I'm defective and their anxiety states, you know, I might piss somebody off I might get rejected. I might get hurt. I might lose. I might look foolish so, you know, both of those states really play into it and one of the things I've come to see is is that Whether we've got just just kind of break it down whether we got kind of the asshole jerk over here that fighter that quick to fight guy Or the wussy doormat, you know, the nice guy over here. That's the avoidant and kind of doesn't like the conflict I think they're they're both on the the same continuum I think they are both in a fight flight freeze mode of managing their interstates of anxiety The nice guy is in the flight freeze bond sometimes added to that list And what we call the jerk is in the fight mode now They're both still just trying to manipulate People and situations outside of them because they're anxious the nice guy does it by being nice and avoidant and not upsetting anybody And you know waiting for it to blow over you all that kind of whereas, you know The guy the other end of the spectrum is it's just he just quick to react with aggression to manage the people and situations around him So so he doesn't feel afraid and anxious And so men will often, you know, they'll read my book or you know, they'll hear some of my information They'll say robert I get that being a nice guy isn't working and I don't want to be that But I don't want to be the asshole either and you know, where where's that middle ground and I go I actually don't know where the tipping point is between two Dysfunctional extremes. It doesn't exist, right? What what we're actually talking about is is going to a different plane a different level Where we actually learn to soothe ourselves We're actually learned to be assertive where we actually learn to have boundaries Or we actually learn to be differentiated and ask ourselves What do I want and follow through on it where there's you know, there's a whole different plane of behavior versus just What do I do to not feel anxious here? But again, the nice guy and the jerk probably neither one is aware that they're trying to manage their anxiety states And and it isn't until you actually Get told that maybe that's what you're doing you go. Oh, wow I never thought about that before and then then you actually can feel your anxiety Rather than trying to just manage it to where it doesn't, you know Make you feel so anxious. Is it a desire to feel safe then to feel reassured? Yeah, I think, you know safety's at the core because Well, I took child development 101 back in grad school I think the very first thing they told us one of the few things maybe I remembered Was that for every child abandonment equals death? So children come into the world inherently vulnerable All right, there's no one to take care of us It takes humans longer to mature into self-sufficiency than any other animal on the planet You know our grandfathers, maybe that was about 12 or 14, you know My age was more, you know, considered 18 21 22 that was like 35 for a young man to you know Mature to be able to take care of himself. That's a joke. Um, but but it's true So we're dependent completely dependent and if somebody doesn't take care of us we die So if we get abandoned neglected, uh, we die So I know for me like when my wife, you know, I'm My wife Lupita and I've been married for seven years now Mexican woman I met here in Mexico and um, she gets a look on her face and like I'll go into, you know, this motive. I gotta I gotta fix it. She's upset. She's angry. I gotta make it better And you know, I've been working on this stuff for 30 years So you know Not like I don't know You know what's happening and I'll just watch myself have this anxiety state That I gotta I gotta talk her down through over get her back to good, you know, make her happy again And I'm thinking why am I worried about with this short little Mexican woman? Why what look she has on her face? I love her of course But why why is that triggering such depth of anxiety and really is a you really sat with and worked with it It triggers a really old emotional state that does feel like I'm gonna die If this doesn't get better right now I'm gonna die and I don't actually have that thought in my head But my reaction to it feels that intense. That's the embodied Sensation if you ask the embodied the nervous system my emotional operating system. Yeah, yeah I wonder Stepping outside of relationships for a second Relationships with anybody including friendships One of the patterns that I've noticed Especially amongst some of my friends that are nice guys or recovering nice guys Is a desire to Do things right? Oh, of course to like a task in and of itself Uh, I would guess that nice guys are probably more orderly than the normal person sources will be stacked in the in the right way You know, mustn't have a very room Because again, you'd think that you'd think that okay. I got to do it right I got to do orderly, but you know, I've got my camera angled or you can't see what's over on the sides All right, it's it's it's a mess. It is it's not terrible, but It it is messier on the sides than it is behind me. Okay. And so Again, a lot of the nice guys I work with They may have perfectionistic expectations of themselves Um, and some worked really hard to to to meet them and then they're they're in a state of anxiety all the time But others I know they go, you know, I haven't made my bed in years. You know, I don't pick up after myself I can't remember the last time I I checked my bank account balance So you'd think there would be that but but ironically Um, there's not and here's a piece that That it may sound an odd on on the surface of it But when I talk with nice guys about their fears and their anxieties I think one of the biggest anxiety or fear state that the typical nice guy might have Isn't so much a fear of failure fear of foolishness fear of looking foolish fear of loss fear of making a mistake Is fear of success? Because what happens if I do get it right? What happens if I rise up to a level of success and then, you know There's things that can happen all of a sudden the bar gets raised the expectations are higher I'm in a brighter spotlight. I might get attacked. I'm more visible um There's so many I'll lose control over my time all of these Built in anxieties of what happens if I'm too successful So again, a lot of times the nice guys will unconsciously I don't really like the word self sabotage But they'll get in their own way of living up to to their full potential And keeping things messy around you is actually a pretty good way to you know, you know, not live up your full potential Not checking your bank account every now and then, you know, I'll bite you on the ass sooner or later isn't it isn't interesting that the almost universality of high ability of this honest Do you want to uh, do you need to sort the dog? This is a regular occurrence I can see She's usually in the room with me and and she's a deer. I this is my bringing her in she can chill Yeah, the problem is she's upset because somebody's out front and I'm the only one home And I don't want to go deal with whoever might be up Okay, it could just be my wife getting home with my daughter from school. Okay. Okay. So um Yeah, she's just being a good girl. Let me know exactly. Yeah, poppy. There's somebody out there. There's somebody out there Let's go. Let's go and it may have been she just saw a cat. So, you know, I I don't know so be it um She walked away. So She's bored of you now. Yeah, it's interesting that there is uh, there's almost universality of Uh, not having healthy boundaries. Yeah of being dishonest of being manipulative although you don't think that you are you're Overly pliable in a way that means that you change yourself to get the outcome that you want from people But it seems at least based on what you've said here that there there appears to be a boundary at least typically among the nice guys where this doesn't outside of relationships friendships family Dating etc. This doesn't spread out into a Uh Overbearing desire for for orderliness and and sort of perfectionism in all areas of life You know with regards to an obsession about getting it right about being It can't I just what I'm trying to say is it's not universal Whereas the other stuff is yeah, but it's what it shows or at least what it says to me is that there's something It it's obvious that ground zero for this stuff is relationships You know that that would have been my first thought as well because it is for me and it is for many nice guys But you know what I've I've seen guys who are total nice guys In relationship and they get on the job and they kick ass You know that they're highly successful at work. I've known other people that it showed up You know at work where they're a told nice guy and going along to getting along and never really stepping up or never launching You know that that business and but at home, you know, their their wife would say he's not a nice guy He's nice to everybody else, but he's not nice to me So it can be interesting and and that would again when I started working with nice guys I just assume there's a one piece fits all And and there's really not now there are those certain commonalities But I think partly because we're also dealing with temperament That for example, maybe you and I had very different life experiences Maybe we have some similarities of temperament some differences different life experiences We're not going to turn out just the same. We may still have those tendencies of you know seeking approval avoiding conflict You know kind of a uh, oh, you know, I'm so good. Why doesn't everybody like me and everybody try to be just like me? um There might be some similarities But we might be very different and still relate to this. Yes. I'm a nice guy Understood. What about hidden behavior? They keep things hidden from themselves. They keep Why is that so common? Why is it common because you know those two things when you know when we first started you asked me, you know What what is the nice guy and basically and and I said he's the guy trying to get everybody's approval and validation You know holding your finger ups. It's which way is a wind blowing But the other piece is that hiding things about ourselves, you know hiding anything for example that might get that look on my wife's face You know, oh, she got that look. I must have done something. I better not do that again You know again that began at a very very early age when getting that look from somebody important to us might result in getting slapped getting smacked getting neglected getting yelled at getting shaken whatever so Nice guys. This is part of that. I got to hide whatever there is about me that tends to create these negative reactions around me But often there's another piece not again not universal but often for nice guys in their family system Somebody has been defined as the needy person the most important person Could be dad could be mom could be a sibling and their needs were more important All the attention and focus went on, you know making sure dad never got pissed off making sure mom didn't go on a tirade Making sure, you know, brother doesn't you know, whatever, you know, he's sick or he's he's out of control So often for nice guys, we try to become this needless Wantless never rock the boat never be a moment's problem kind of person so What we interpret is us having needs Draws too much attention and and you know my their needs are more important than mine and so Nice guys, we're Again trying to avoid that negative reaction the two things we often most hide Are our needs and wants and our sexuality the sexuality that's kind of easy to put a finger on You know, we live in a culture that we're bombarded with sexual stimuli everywhere you go But still there's still that you know that religious message that sex is bad evil save it for the one you love shame Yeah, just a whole shame wrapped around sexuality you'd think that would have gone away by now But but it's not it's as strong as ever. So for the the the the very young nice guy When kind of kind of back up a little bit back to the to the child development 101 stuff again Every child when they experience discomfort of any kind, you know, the hungry and they don't get fed They're they're they wet their diaper. They mess in their diaper. They don't get changed or cold. They don't get help Then you know, they have stomach ache. They don't get burped whatever Whenever a child experiences discomfort their children are narcissistic by nature Emotionally, they assume this is me. I I'm the cause of this I did something wrong. I'm bad They don't think it because the thinking brain isn't online at this early age the emotional brain fight flight free survival brain is And so a child will try to do two things in a very primitive way a non-thinking non-rational purely emotional way They will try to medicate the feeling states they're having Suck their thumb eat cry sleep Whatever to try to not feel bad right now And again in a very pre very primitive pre verbal kind of way Try to do try to not do whatever that was it caused the uncomfortable states or do something different And so that begins at a really early age and so the child is These these the shame is is inaccurately internalized at an emotional level. I must have done something wrong That's why this is happening. So I got to figure you how to do that different or not do that hide And so all of this comes So early as part of an emotional language an emotional operating system. It's not in words. It's not in picture memory And it's it's primitive So here we are trying to figure out how not to have these uncomfortable experiences and prevent them from happening again And one of the best things our primitive brain came up with is hide Hide, you know, whatever that I have needs all I have needs I I get I'm I'm hungry when I have needs I get slapped. Oh, their needs are more important than mine so Just hiding is part of that because we think it must be about me That's causing these painful negative experiences to be happening to us Does this mean the nice guys often have coping strategies? Maybe they'll overeat maybe they'll be compulsive with social media use or porn or video games or Substances or whatever The thing about that model. I just gave you that child development model Every human does that every human We all just pick usually again based on temperament and maybe just life experiences and birth order We all pick what are we going to do? How are we going to try to manage this? And I sucked my thumb times in kindergarten. I think maybe I was trying to Deal with some uncomfortable self-soothing self-soothing exactly trying to manage some anxiety there So that's what I did now We we go through childhood then we hit adolescence and now we really want people's approval and want to fit in and be noticed and have attention All of this really, you know, it gets Fueled with with with our hormones and need for attention Where you know, they really get solidified and we pretty much carry these routines into adulthood So yeah, trying to be perfect might be one You know trying not to be perfect because my brother was perfect and I couldn't you know compete with him So I'll be the opposite. I'll I'll make the mess Yeah, when I eat I sure do feel better when I spend all my day and night playing video games I I don't feel stressed when I'm oh, isn't porn amazing. I didn't know that this existed. Look how I feel Um, oh, you know, if I get straight A's look, I I finally get some validation But I don't know if it's ever enough. I better keep, you know succeeding performing You know, I better get into great amazing shapes so I can be valuable Oh, I'll never get in good shape. So who cares? I'll just keep eating it can take so many different forms And the only real logic to it is the the infant logic That you and I and everybody else had at a few weeks and a few months old Why uh nice guys bad receivers Because we think it makes us bad, you know, the the thing is is that As I said, most of us is is most nice guys internalize this belief. Well, I because I have needs That's why I I have these bad things that happen to me If I don't have needs bad things won't happen and often again, they I could I could look around in my family Oh, dad's needs are more important. Well, let's all make sure dad's okay. Oh now mom's unhappy. Let's all make sure mom's okay My little brother was a general fuck up at pretty much everything. Oh, okay You know, we got to make sure little brother's okay because he's gonna fuck up and I kind of like oh If I don't have needs if I just kind of do everything right, I'll be the golden child I'll get some validation. You know, I I won't get noticed too much and getting trouble and and so again That was my story. It's not every nice guy story but There's some fundamental piece in there that if if is visible if people know I have needs like that makes me vulnerable It puts me at risk. It gets people control over me. I'll owe people something So in my own personal work, one of the earliest things I had to start doing was was making me a priority where I Put where I did for me. I I'd do for everybody else But I wouldn't make me a priority and you know, I'd make sure you know, my wife and kids they all went to the dentist I wouldn't go to the dentist. Oh, they you know, if I saw something on sale, I'd buy it for them I wouldn't buy it for me. So I had to start taking good care of me The next step that that kind of came with that but came a little bit later for me Was actually beginning to surround myself with people who wanted to help me meet my needs and then actually letting them That was really anxiety producing to let people do things for me and I had to consciously just go Okay, I'm it's as simple as like I'll take the garbage out And you know, we got to take the garbage from the kitchen to the front gate It's 20 feet got to unlock the gate put it out on the street My if I'm taking the garbage at my wife will go you need help Well, no, I don't I don't need any help to take a bag of garbage from the kitchen to the front And and so I my gut response always say no, but then I realize well I don't need any help, but she wants to be with me. She wants to accompany me She doesn't want to think I'm doing all the work. Well, she's not she's very hard worker I go. Yeah. Yeah, come help me. Do I really need the help? No But it was actually it took me a while. I'm still learning that way You know, she's not really thinking I need help taking the garbage out She just wants to come take the garbage out with me just to walk to the street with me and back You know, that's that's okay. Well, who might have say no to that? That's the thing about being a bad receiver It robs people of the enjoyment Of helping you you've you've stole my words when I'm When I got I got divorced in my late 40s after 25 years of marriage to two different women And again when I started dating and started meeting nice girls, you know Who wanted to do anything for me wouldn't ever say what they wanted wouldn't make it to say I thought oh, I'd I'd empathy for my two ex-wives what I put them through with being an ice guy But I remember I was dating one woman and I met her because she sold me shoes at Nordstrom And she so she worked in retail fashion sales and her one time she came over to my apartment And I'd done some laundry left it on my couch She started folding my laundry and I said you you don't have to do that She goes no, I like doing it and and she goes and I'm good at it And you know, so she folds on my laundry puts a little stack on the end of my bed And she goes but I won't put it away for you. I said I'm not putting it away either I'm leaving it out there to remind me somebody loves me, you know that that somebody wanted to do something nice for me After that I started leaving my clean laundry on the couch So she could have the joy Of coming over and because it gave her pleasure Now who am I to rob her of that pleasure? And I need to work on it because how am I going to receive great things in this world? If I'm not good at receiving if I can't if I can't let somebody fold my laundry How am I going to receive the blessings of wealth of fame opportunity of adventure? So it's it's a very conscious practice. It was for me. So how do I let people give and let them have the pleasure of doing it? So the solution is not being a bad guy because a lot of people and you could try so, you know Nice guys finish last the bad guy gets the girl, you know, women will Sleep with the alpha but marry the beta, you know, pick your meme or cliche of choice But they're all out there sure to come up with And it seems let me I'm going to try and interpret what I think the Your philosophy is and let me know if I get it right I think The downsides of being a nice guy Although subtle and often completely opaque to the nice guys themselves. Yes are kind of evident given Can become evident given enough crowd sourcing of sense making so people and community Come up with memes and characters in tv shows and stuff like that right The solution that the low resolution solution that then gets proposed is if x x being nice guy Is bad and doesn't get what you want Then opposite of x y which is bad guy must be good so the prevalence of In you know, uh treat her like you don't like her Like why women love chads like that kind of more Um Lethario approach to attracting women and and and getting what you want in life and sort of you know being ruthless and stuff Is that a an erroneous solution to the problem of nice kindness it's A core problem with what you just proposed is it is equally inauthentic As as the other and it's equally attached to some external outcome By trying to figure out how to do it right Right. How about I just do this right again, then I'll get the women to approve of me We're still in the same boat. We're just looking for a different right way of doing it now As simple as this sounds, you know, like when I do like interviews with like a female coach that that maybe works with men and um And I say something that you know generalization like the feminine meaning all things feminine, you know women but Dogs cats babies opportunity money weather whatever I'll say is highly attracted to a man who's comfortable in his own skin knows where he's going And looks like he's having a good time going there And the women, you know coaches interviewers podcasters on the call always go Oh, yes Okay, they're they're reacting kind of their nervous system is reacting to that thing. I didn't say the guy's an asshole I didn't say he treats women bad. I didn't say doesn't give a fuck about He he's he's centered in his own body He's he's differentiated. He's asking himself. What do I want? What's important to me? Following through on that, you know, not leaving the message behind not trying to be perfect not seeking anybody's approval He's on mission. He's on purpose And in my experience the feminine is highly attracted to that you don't have to work At at getting the feminine to be attracted now Are you always going to have feminine approval? I told someone the other day This has never come out of my mouth before but I said actually there is no standard of feminine approval But the feminine is not about standards. It's just about whatever is moving masculine at standards You you go into the masculine world You know when you've lived up to the standard when you've hit the ball out of the park when you've scored a touchdown When you made ace when you you know made x amount of money the masculine doing standards are clear We can go into that world and go I've achieved. I've made it We have it. We have the stats rigorous. It's orderly Requires something of you. There's discipline The fat there is no such thing as feminine approval I mean ask any guy even a woman who approved of them dearly in one moment I'll ask them. Have you ever had experiences where the very next moment she was unapproving of you and nothing about you had changed you had even And guys all go yeah, isn't that the way it always works? Yeah, you know one minute when I was dating I had women tell me robert. You're the most amazing man. I'm so glad I met you. I'm so grateful I'm so happy and then never hear from them again Or say robert, you know after two weeks, you know, I'm taking a break from dating or I'm giving my ex another try And I'm going what just happened. That's the world of the feminine It doesn't it isn't nailed down and orderly. So we we have to quit seeking feminine approval One of my certified coaches wrote a book that that I really like but there's a line in there It said that a man does not mature Until he quit seeking the love of a woman As long as we're seeking love that's a feminine trait long as we're seeking to get that approval that love that validation from a woman We're in a loop that there's no escape from But when we when we can self validate when we're on purpose when we're living life on our terms All of a sudden that makes us very attractive to the feminine. It will come to us. That's that's my experience It will come Now as soon as you turn and go, oh is here. How do I keep it? How do I make no no no? We just blew it. All of a sudden now they're going to get that look on their face again. Like I go what I do wrong so If we take the how do I get the women's approval out of the equation You're more likely to get it does that mean you just don't give a fuck don't care whatever That's not what I'm again. It's not black and white We we men want to make it black and white. It must be this or it must be that no It's this this is Another level that we rise to that lets us put a dent in the universe that lets us Live with purpose and passion that lets us connect deeply with others that lets us be vulnerable and courageous That actually invites the love Into our life that that we desire rather than seeking it Well, ultimately I was watching this um Video from a lander botan from the school of life. Do you know that guy? British philosopher phenomenal insight You were the second person who mentioned him in the last two or three days I always pay attention when so whenever I hear someone's name like, you know Whenever I heard you need to get on chris williamson's show when I heard that three times in the same week You know, I thought wait a minute that name sounds familiar. Oh Oh I'm on he's on my calendar. What do you what do you know? It's um, so I use a I'll just say what you're referring to he wrote an op-ed article in the new york times Maybe 10 years ago He's now the title was why you will marry the wrong wrong person. Yeah, I love I love that article. I copied it It's it's just class. He's outstanding. Uh, I've he is on my mount rushmore of of of guests He was very formative for me. Um, one of the reasons that I'm gonna go on a tangent about why I love a lander botan one of the reasons that I really love him is he's so Softly spoken and he's so embodied in the nuance of Being fallible of how our emotions run the show. He's not posture. He's unbelievably smart you know, he's very very well versed in renaissance art and history and poetry and and sculpture and and and All all this stuff, but there's no posturing From his left brain. Yeah, there's none of this sort of over rationality. He he Accepts with complete face value the fact that we can be self contradictory and embarrassing and and all the rest of it But anyway, he has he has this line in a video that I was watching recently Where he talks about A person whose greatest achievement would be after their death people would say they never made a fuss Oh, they didn't make a fuss. They didn't you know, they didn't cause any ripples They didn't make any waves and he's talking about largely An equivalent of the nice guy this person who's you know overly pliable who's concerned about upsetting others who's doing all of this stuff Anna, I just it really it really sort of struck home like oh my god, like that's the That's the inheritance and the legacy which is waiting for you and ultimately You can make it to the end of your life having Either made all of the messes in the world or made zero messes at all depending on whether you go bad guy mode or nice guy mode But Like your legacy as you look back on your life is going to be one of You playing a persona You're never going to really be able to connect to any of the things that you do people accomplishments praise compliments adoration money Because it wasn't you that earned that You didn't earn your money The role that you're playing earned the money The role that you're playing got the marriage the role that you're playing got the relationship or the job raise or Or created the family or the the billion dollar company. It wasn't you wasn't you That's kind of messes with your head doesn't it It's scary You know when you were describing and I can't pronounce his name pronounce his name a land of botan. Oh, yeah, that's beautiful When you are describing him i'm sitting there thinking i'm a straight guy And that guy sounds sexy as hell the way you were destroyed. He's I mean, he's got the classic philosophers build, but so be it. So be it Here's something else. So here's something else that i've had in in my mind um Since looking at your work and kind of i've spent a lot of time over the last three years Looking at evolutionary psychology mating dynamics so on and so forth We don't see especially from women at the moment Many conversations online About nice guys about guys being too nice about guys being too pliable A lot of the conversations skews toward guys being too toxic guys being too immature But it's immature it it tends to be in a in a toxic manner It's sort of the use and discard the use and abuse The the very sort of transient transactional nature What is the reason do you think? That there isn't as much popularity if if and i don't disagree I think that a huge problem will be the pliability and and dishonesty and niceness of men Is it just less Tweetable to to have that as the reason that you can't find met I've got all of these men that keep bending over backward and keep doing things to me Is it that it's kind of publicly unpopular for women to call that out because it seems like they're being ungrateful What do you what do you think it is? Well? Because i'm not in a woman's head. I I can't and because i'm not on social media I also but I I do know what you're talking about Of course, there are memes that that that run and I I do you know because I get a google uh notice every time Nice guy, you know pops up somewhere. I I do see what when it does pop up it usually pops up and write wing republican writing um most often but When women do Write their blog articles about nice guys It is most often how nice guys aren't nice of how they use basically the covert contracts of oh I'm going to listen you talk about your problems. I'm going to pay your car payment this month. I'm going to Pretend like I care about you and then when they you know ask the woman out or wanted to have sex They goes no I never thought of you that way you're a friend, you know And then the and then the guy of course that all that resentfulness that passive aggressive that rage comes out And so, you know that meme does show up, but but it still ends up being toxic masculinity Here is my thought and it sounds like you've looked a lot at this and you might even have a better perspective than me My thought is that You know, I grew up during whatever the wave of the angry feminism was in the 60s and 70s I don't know if that's first wave second wave But you know every man's a rapist and erections a sign of aggression and you know that already bought in my mother You know my mother's generation with the first I think true feminists She raised my my sister to not need a man raised her boys to be different from their father You know that was kind of the beginning of that movement and um So From that I grew up with I don't be like those bad men the women are complaining about so So kind of the toxic masculinity meme has been around for a while It just didn't have social media and now mainstream media mainstream me I I can't even listen to like npr anymore because it's kind of like it's just gone so much to like Let's just run fluff articles, you know fluff stories and stuff like that. I agreed. Um I think There had to be a pendulum swing You know most of that's directed at patriarchy, you know now you just say patriarchy and like we all understand exactly what that means It's evil, right? But but patriarchy was also providing protect, you know, there was also Positives a part of it and was there an ownership mentality? Yeah Did that lead to colonialism and you know abuses towards women and children? Yeah Uh racism. Yeah, so yeah all of that Well, you know when we make a social change we tend to throw the baby out with the bathwater So, yeah, this was rail against this big idea of patriarchy toxic masculinity, you know You know mansplaining man spreading everything that men do is bad kind of stuff I Think maybe it had to go to an extreme and and I think most sociologists that look at big shifts in society Say when you have an oppressed people Um the down drawing it almost has to become like a revolution. It has to be at the extremes It doesn't have to be a correction. Yeah, it's not like a Gandhi that just you know, let's subtly create the shift Um, so I think there has to be that over correction And and you know, so we went through the hashtag me too where you know, men were you know, you know, accused tried You know prosecuted and you know in the media lost jobs lost status purely because some woman said oh I want to join the me too crowd, you know, and yeah, there was a lot of abuses that were being addressed Should they've been addressed through social media? I don't know if that was you know, the most Democratic way to do it, but it's how it got done and then you know, yeah If you you know publish something that gets a lot of likes and a lot of Follows and yeah other people are going to publish it. So yeah, it went to the incentives aligned to make it happen Of course they do and social media is all about algorithms and you know the more something shows up the more you see of it Uh, that's why I told one of the reasons I don't like social media um But I actually think That we're actually making an adjustment You know, I I I saw articles Yeah, a couple years ago likening anything that had to do with men's work To like the oh there goes the balloons Jesus christ I didn't think it was gonna work. How have you managed to make balloons come up on this? I promise I promise. I'm magic. Stop doing it I I wish I yeah, I can't quit moving my hands now. The thumb will probably go up. Maybe maybe confetti All right. All right. Okay. So even just a couple years ago I saw articles about linking the january 6th, you know riots, you know in washington dc To anything having to do with men's work like conflating that that all came out of the men's movement and I'm going And this was in main is washington post random article like that, right? So it's mainstream media I think actually That I think maybe we've reached that far enough far extreme And I think maybe it's starting So we're all of a sudden that's losing this interest is it seems to you know, oh, okay There's another meme about toxic masculinity. Oh, there's another meme about andrew tape There's another, you know, blah blah blah and people do get bored and now maybe in this because I'm In the middle of men's work. It's what I've done for years And I'm I'm in you know a men's program myself. I built a men's program. I believe in it I I really do think we're moving to a better space that as men become more conscious Um of the things that I think, you know, they teach they're valuable You know being honest being transparent making their needs of priority Surrounding themselves with people on how to get their needs met living with purpose living with passion, you know Being generous making the world a better place being open-hearted being loving, you know quality good qualities That I think Is changing the world is shifting the dynamic Women I think will begin to go that that's actually really attractive. That's that's sexy. That's better. I like that and um And I think there'll still be a few ones hanging on to but I let's all still stay mad at men Let's you know, let's still and after a while, you know, one of the things that really was a big shock to me I was probably in my 40s When I was I was talking to you know a feminist and I mentioned somebody who identified as a feminist a woman Maybe on an airplane and and I said, well, here's the feminism I grew up with And she said, oh, you mean that every man's a rapist you you like Believed all that I go Well, it sure was because that was just a few angry pissed off women that got a lot of attention I go that's all it was not all women felt that way. She goes no and they still don't I go That's actually good to know that maybe all that noise that you know gets a lot of likes and follows Maybe that doesn't represent But even the majority of women there was a really wonderful term that I heard last year called the tyranny of the minority And it happens. Yeah, I think that that explains it Another way of putting it is the slowest dumb shit on the freeway is going to control how fast everybody can go Very good. Yes. Yes. We're controlled by the extremes and the idiots um It's interesting to think about why that might be the case. I think that you've probably you're probably not far wrong that It's still so popular to fit men into the impressive tyrannical patriarchal overbearing dominating controlling role that If women were to if a woman was to post online something which is more more honest, perhaps which would be Um, I keep going out for men who are overly pliable and because they're so pliable I'm concerned that they're not being honest with me What does that sound like? Well, it sounds like a call for men to be less pliable Which is not far away from men to be more aggressive more controlling Writing a book that's called no more. Mr. Nice guy. Why would someone write a book teaching men to be not nice? We do we do Live in a black and white world and again media social media Loves the black and white. It doesn't like nuance subtlety That's the dangerous the real n word of 2024 is nuance. That's the real one that you shouldn't be saying All right, so getting into getting into relationships, which are obviously I think ground zero for a lot of this stuff You know, you can kind of hide things away from yourself when it's on your own And you're in and out of work and all the rest of it If you know, everybody is emotionally connected with the work and everybody's emotionally connected with how organized their source cupboard is Relationships real ground zero. What do nice guys not understand about how female attraction works? Well, most of us are believing what our mothers told us, you know, uh, if they told us anything Which is to be nice to girls with my mother said be a gentleman Okay, make sense. You know be a gentleman and I am Uh, I'm a gentleman, but a woman taught me this one. Uh, I always open the door for women I tell them wait for me. I'll open your door. Now if you really break it down, that's me being dominant You know, I tell them what to do wait for me. I'm gonna open your door And of the of the several hundred women who I've told to do wait for me. I'll open your door Only one has pushed back against it and she pushed back for a while Then all of a sudden she quit and kind of decided she actually really liked Actually what she did is she jumped my bones in a public place and a very I said We need to take this somewhere else after the while she's been pushing back against my dominance so For there to be attraction there has to be a polarity And polarity involves dominance and submission. I know those are evil terrible words, you know Because we think about dominant men, you know making women be submissive. You're in you're in a safe space here I'm not I'm not sweating it But yeah, it is okay. It is going out on the internet, which is fine You know and what's happened is a polarity has just switched where the females have become dominant the dominant players And the guys have become the submissive players and then the the women go How come I can't find a guy that turns me on and the guys you're going? How come I can't seem to turn women on? Well, it's it's is reversed a polarity You you can't have polarity. That's attraction without dominance and submission And the more subtle it is the more subtle the attraction is the more Latent it is tends to be the more intensity attraction is we've probably all experienced that in one way or another And I tell people you can't have sex without dominance and submission Otherwise, there's two bodies lying next to each other waiting for something to happen You know you gotta have a yeah, you know fight you have a top and bottom You have a picture and catcher right there's got to be A polarity now the beauty is that polarity can you can flip it around? You know back and forth and I think in very conscious relationships That that happens beautifully my wife's very strong She grew up eight out of ten kids in poverty in guadalajara, mexico alcoholic father got beat on by family members beat on by neighbors You know abused by family members abused by priests, you know, she's she's been through You know, she goes to the gym two hours a day. She can out squat me easily. She's done my thigh. I don't I don't piss her off Um, you know, she can get shit done I grew up in a middle class white bread neighborhood of seattle washington Surrounded by bowing engineer families, you know, it's just you know, I never had to fight for anything Okay, so she's tough But she doesn't she's always told me I love it when you tell me no She goes, I don't I don't want to be in charge. I don't want you to always ask me what what you know What do you want to do? She she likes it when I make we're walking to a restaurant And you know, though here in mexico and they'll say no they'll say should I the last curtain? Should I get the waiter say should I give him a menu in english? She goes no He lives in mexico give him one in spanish and I'll say yeah Give my wife and kids the menu in english And then they hand her a menu and she goes no, he's my boss He'll order for me and they always laugh about that and I say yeah I get to be the boss when she says I can't you know, so we got those the whole stick down But the truth is she is strong. She's powerful. She can get shit done. She can kick ass But she doesn't want to be in that mode all the time She wants to to be led. She wants to submit. She wants to open She wants to be done too in blissful kinds of ways. Well, that's my job Right. So and even though I'm kind of more that I'm I'm go along to get along. I you know, I'm yeah This or that either one's okay with me. I'm kind of more that way She doesn't like it when I'm that way So for her she's happiest when I will play the default lead the default decision maker But she likes it best when I said here's what I was thinking. What do you think? You know, I don't just say what do you think, you know, what do you want? I'll say, you know, I was thinking a white with a little bit of tint of gray in it What do you think? You know, she wants me to to to lead that and then she'll feel the polarity and then she'll tell me What she thinks or wants and then you just say you decide Okay, let's go. Let's go. Let's go pick out the paint Um, am I being abusive to her by being dominant? No, I've heard so many women tell me When the guy leaves it all up to them to comply it the women feel burdened by that most are in their masculine dominant role all day long in their work in their career Raising children even mothering is a masculine dominant state to be in you're taking care of kids needs That's not feminine. I don't them want to have to take care of your partner after that Yeah, then then when the guy says oh, I don't get you want to have sex tonight Would you or what do you want for and it's just one more thing that they got to check off there to do is They don't want that Now am I making a generalization? Yeah. Is it fluid? Yeah. Is it nuanced? Yeah Is it okay? The guy's always got to be the dominant the woman's but no that's not what I'm saying But for for men when I start talking about them consciously setting the tone and leading in relationship When I say that to a nice guy The response he usually he'll pondering okay, dr. Glover what I hear you say when you say take control I go no no you did not hear me say the word take control. I did not say it I don't believe in it. I'm talking about you lead you set the tone you state what you want where you want to go What you want to eat and and and give her a chance to follow like on the dance floor She can't follow where you don't lead Give her that and then Be open to a discussion be open to her taking the you know setting the tone and leading But it's not about but guys nice guys will say when you know when you said take control Is more nuanced than that but again So that that that's my job is helping guys Apply the the nuance that that word of 2024 What is the role of emotional tension? Oh, you've done some research Yeah, that's a cute little wink of the high that just it was just flirting with you. I'm just It's reflexive. I'm just trying to flirt with you. Yeah I know the girls like it. Probably the boys do too. I I live in a very gay community. So, you know I know how it is Okay, so the role of emotional tension. There we go. We just had emotional tension going on right there. Yep I'm gonna I'm gonna make a generalization that doesn't apply to everybody But it does seem to apply to a lot and that's the generalized statement is Is that in general for women to experience attraction? Say towards a man Arousal and to stay attached to that man over time. She has to experience some kind of emotional tension She's got to feel something the butterflies and this the that the drama that does he love me doesn't love me And we men can kind of understand that a little bit. We kind of like the tension we feel of go Feel it's nice, you know like her boobs whatever, you know, that creates attention for us But in general men don't like emotional tension, especially in relationship If you even think about, you know, our sporting events where we do get our tension and clocks on them You know, we know it's going to end at this time. That's why baseball is falling out of favor That's why they put a clock on baseball. They put the they put the pitch clock last year Yeah, you know, how many times you can throw it at first, you know, because oh, we got to have it on a clock You know, so um, so men's tension is on the clock Oh, yeah, I I know this, you know, this this adventure flick i'm watching in the hero This is happening. I know he's gonna get out of it and it's gonna be done in 35 minutes, you know, it's done We're done. Shoot go home kick back into nothingness, right? The feminine never gets tired of tension the feminine if it If it isn't feeling tension is bored. It will create tension And so that's what's hard for men to understand, you know We think to be nice to women will make them be attracted to us But nice creates absolutely no attention no tension really for anybody Men or women, but we think well, that's what mom told me to do. Go be go go be nice to them It's what that's what I in junior high all the women were complaining about those jerks who create attention for them And so I listened to her complain about the jerk since she kept going back to the jerk even after you know, I'm such a nice guy So in general women need that emotional tension watch it. They create it within themselves Um and and we guys if we have any kind of tension between us We'll just have it out. Maybe we'll punch each other and then we'll be done. We'll go have a beer. It's all good, you know We don't need to keep going back into that tension state to have a bond have a connection Well, we'll go do something together. We may go compete We may go bring our a game and leave it all on the field, but then we walk off arm and arm So it's just the the the difference between that masculine and feminine So the hardest part for men to understand is that the women need that tension. So even when I say wait for me. I'll open your door And now I create a little bit of dominance and she waits for me. That's tension All right, it's just a little bit. It's a little subtle, you know, even like, you know Say hey, put the menu down. I'll order for us tonight There's tension and I'm not being nice. It's actually creating something. What's he gonna order for? Is he gonna pick something? I like do I trust him? Is it gonna be an adventure? You know, I tell guys and you know and you know guys will think it's game playing And it kind of can look like that and but the the real thing is it's actually just is how do we get more conscious? So I'll tell a guy for example, you know If a woman sends you a message text message or calls you and if you reply right away or you pick up the phone and answer How much tension will the woman experience through that? Well, well, none we've relieved it as soon as we answered the phone or tension went away But what if you didn't answer it? What if you called her back in 30 seconds 45 seconds An hour and she goes, where were you? Why didn't you answer? And what if you didn't give her an answer to that? And she's going why didn't he answer? What was he doing now? Here's the thing because those guys Ten if we do have emotional tension, we like what I call positive emotional tension You know, it it feels good to us where you're at For the for women they don't care. Is it positive emotional tension? Is it is it pet or is it net negative emotional tension? They don't care emotional tension is emotional tension And so, you know, it means, you know, them starting a fight, you know them doing something knows They know it's going to piss us off. It's kind of like they don't care They got our attention And and that's all that mattered. They got our attention and there's tension And and even the thing of guys like listening to women talk about the problems. I tell guys there's a an inverse negative relationship between the amount of time a man spends listening to a woman talk about her problems And the likelihood he's going to get laid what you mean It means that if you say and listen to talk about her problems, you've actually relieved all of her tension Tensions flowed completely out of because you know, she talked she talked she talked all the tension Came away and what I tell guys is then you end up looking like Her girlfriend with a penis and odds are she doesn't want to have sex with her girlfriend So anything we do to relieve their tension Actually works against us and robs them kind of like we talked about earlier Are we going to rob them of the joy of doing for us? Well, are we going to rob them of the emotional tension that they have to have to feel to feel something To to want to engage You had this fantastic example of how emotional tension is enjoyed differently by men and women by the story arcs of romantic comedies and how men and women Uh, experience experience that can you explain that? Well, you mean like, you know, you you take your woman to watch titanic and she titanic You know, she's already seen it eight times and she walks away with her panties wet thinking outcome I can't have that and the guy the guy's checking his watch checking his phone his fort center on yet How do I get out of here? I I thought what was particularly interesting was you you explaining and it really sort of hit home to me that Uh, if you're a man who's watching a romantic comedy you see um regulation at the beginning everything is is fine Then you see dysregulation something happens and everything goes up in the air Then you see regulation again or more like Middle movie regulation whether the couple first starts to get together and you're like, oh, well, I mean that's it like let's go home The movie's done. Yes done. Whereas what the woman then wants is this protracted Oh, but the ex-girlfriend's back in the picture But oh my god, he hasn't got his right visa and he's going to be deported How are they going to keep the relationship going and it's just protracted and protracted and protracted and protracted and then I don't I don't know what it's like to be a woman at the end of a rom-com But it may be Unsatisfying for there to be a conclusion. It's like what could we just let's roll it for another three hours Let's just continue to extend this and that's maybe we're bollywood figured it out Let's just do the wedding scene everybody's dancing to a real upbeat song We know it's over but now they'll do a part two of it um and you know Women I've been in relationship with learned don't take me to a romantic comedy I'm sitting there going that is so fucking unrealistic. That doesn't happen in the real world How come every guy has a job he doesn't actually have to go to how come every woman's a fashion editor in every one of these Yeah, I know he loves dogs, but he lives in this new york loft and makes canoes. That's how he supports himself Come on. That's not real. Yes Yeah, you don't want to go to a romantic comedy with me because I live in the world of could that really be real Could that really happen? Do people really do that? No, you know, that's not how the real world works But it creates emotional tension and so that's really what it is all about It's not about reality the masculine wants to go resolve all the emotional tension to get us back into reality So yeah, I it's it's really hard for me to watch a romantic comedy Just twiddle my thumbs and just not not say anything. Oh, it's excruciating. So thinking about this Dynamic that we have this emotional tension this amount of of dominance and and uh direction Uh and and suggestion that comes from the man. Um There will be women listening and out there who Enjoy they're writing a blog article about us right now. It's fine. It's added to the list But there will be women listening who? Maybe a little conflicted or there will be men who imagine that the woman might be conflicted because you say well She wants she comes home. She's had a difficult day at the work because kelly that bitch in the cubicle next door Has done that thing again that pisses her off and the woman Wants to be able to vent. She also wants her man to listen to her and it's this odd duality of Not knowing what's best for us And of the things that we want not always being in our best interests and you Quoted the best onion article which is woman turns man into a partner. She doesn't want to be with I I got the article the headline alone is is enough right, you know And and again, this is this is the dance of relationship Wouldn't it be great if you know, we could just say guys just do it this way every woman's going to like it No, it doesn't work that way And but what what you said what was really true is that yeah, so for example You know the woman in your life's been in her masculine all day doing at work Putting up with asshole managers asshole customers asshole clients asshole core workers And now, you know, she comes home. There's one more asshole now is putting demands on her So for example Um, the woman that folded my clothes that I mentioned again, I met her at the mall as she sold me shoes And when after we started dating, um, one of the things where we really clicked is she liked baseball I like baseball Rangers fine. I could have been part of a threesome. It would have been great There we go. You're flirting again But but you lost to me as soon as you said Texas Rangers, you know Hey, those of us with the world series championship in the last year. Yeah, you're you're the we you're the homer Yeah, we we won the world series. Let me see the ring man. Show show me the ring. Okay, so, um She liked baseball so, you know, she'd get off work four or five o'clock in the afternoon I'd already have a bar stool staked out at the roost chris that was right next to you know, where she worked Couple baseball games are already on the screen at the bar They have this great half rice hamburger during happy hour She'd come in and she would just start, you know, I'd already have the wine ordered sitting there You know, the you know the appetizers that come and she's like this about her day Like that. She's been in her mask in all day. I would take out my phone Set it at five minutes and say you have my undivided attention for five minutes. Put the phone on the bar I would give her eye contact. I would face her I would listen undivided attention She would run out of steam before five minutes was up because she's going I sit here complaining But there's a baseball game on and there's a glass of wine sitting here. What do I prefer? Before now if I didn't put her on the clock at five minutes It was a game it was me being dominant but in a loving playful if I didn't put her on the clock She might Be crabby all night long and she would not enjoy herself because one of the things I found is that for Somebody who identifies as feminine to be in their masculine all day Are often not good at getting themselves out of that masculine I got to go home and wash dishes and get the laundry done There's things we got to do before I got to get up and go to work tomorrow I'll sit down. I have a glass of wine. Tell me about your day. Let me rub your feet I'm a big fan of of in a sense Leading her back into her feminine out of that masculine rigid get shit done kind of state of mind And now all of a sudden she begins opening and she'll tell me your attention I might even say a woman taught me this. I'll say, you know what? I want to hear about your day But give me the guy version You know, and I've never had a woman ask me. What does that mean? I'll say you you want me to be your guy, right? Yeah, yeah, all right, then I need the guy version when you tell me about the day Please translate about how Kelly and the cubicle next to her, you know And I know why she does it because you just insecure and she's always wanting attention and she always takes it out of me Dear I love you. Give me the guy version. Kelly pissed me off today. Great Now I understand why you had a bad day So, you know Get playful with it get playful with it There's definitely one of the common threads that I'm noticing through a lot of the dynamics is a degree of playfulness and It's my nature. So it is what I bring and You know, it's it's helping it's helping to it's helping to relieve the tension relieve the tension it's helping to relieve the seriousness Of everything that that it it gives more play It gives like in the engineering term it gives more room within the system for things to breathe You make a suggestion, but it's not it's not done in too Rigid of a fashion. There's there's there's movement in there and it's done It's evident the reason that you're doing it and it's not in a mocking way. It's not in a passive aggressive way It's not in a condescending or patronizing way, but the reason that this I think Works is it shows. Hey, look like we're here to enjoy our time together we're here you're here to enjoy we're here to enjoy this and Whether it's someone's had something good happened. Someone's had something bad happened. Someone's sad. Someone's mad. Someone's whatever The appropriate amount of playfulness I can struggle to think of Really many situations in which it doesn't make it better Yeah, I And that doesn't mean getting silly and everything's a joke because again guys will kind of like oh, you mean make a joke about it and again teaching men to to be lighthearted But that that that can be a pretty daunting task Yeah, um now what's funny though if you get men with men And and let them just kind of begin to let their hair down guys get silly with each other And you know and but we're I think we're afraid of showing that to women Oh, yeah, I won't I won't appear manly. I won't be you know It's a degree of there's a degree of competence. I think Uh, I certainly noticed this. Do you know who charlie hoop it is from charisma on command? He's got a very big charisma channel on youtube. It really really great guy very embodied ton of self work ton of men's work and he Helps mostly men but also women become more charismatic So he's he's learned the principles of confidence and charisma and um one of the best tools that he teaches is when people ask a question The best answer isn't always the right one And you know he uses this example of um, how to overcome your discomfort around trying to be funny And he says if you walk out of the house and you're with people you walk out of a bar Or whatever and the weather is one extreme of either hot or cold make a joke about it being the opposite Yeah, and he was like it's the shittest joke. It is the worst. It's a pure dad joke But he said it'll get a chuckle out of people if you walk outside and it's freezing hot and you go dude Wish I'd brought some shorts today. This is great um like people have a little bit of a chuckle about but it really really Showed me and I have a friend george who's been on the show a lot He a lot of the time if you're playing kind of like a game of tennis So you're playing a game of tennis which involves a linear conversation. Here is a question. There is an answer Here is a question. There is an answer. Here's another answer. Here's another question And you played this back and forth. He regularly hits the ball sideways So he'll call back to a thing that happened a couple of weeks ago or he'll say, oh, you know I bet that such and such a famous person from the media would have done that or whatever like he'll Rip the conversation out like orthogonally from where it is and there's play in that He's not answering the question because he he has the comfort in himself to not need To get validation by being I am the person that always knows the answer I am the person that is always able to give the the correct conclusion that draws the line that puts the full stop And dots the eyes and crosses the t's I don't need to be that person and it's such a breath of fresh air Because you're having this conversation and and you're like, I'm excited. I don't know what's gonna and it Engenders that in you as well, but there's definitely like good boy energy a nice guy energy in I will answer the question properly. I will ensure that this Somebody's asked something of me and to deliver it. I shall and that removes the playfulness. Yeah, you know and When I work with guys around this again when I said when I learned to date in my 40s and 50s I you know, I was never good with women and if I got one I kept them way too long And I started getting successful, you know with dating and getting laid and guys said Robert teach us I'm not a dating guru But what you're talking about is it again for most of the men I worked with they get so afraid I'm gonna do something wrong. I'm gonna make a mistake. I'm gonna piss her off. I'll blow it and then then it's irreparable and I'd say, you know just Toucher don't you know if you have the impulse to touch or touch her if you have the impulse to tease your teaser If you have the impulse to tell her come on. Let's go do this Don't hold back It's crazy as it sounds. I tell guys Blurt and act on impulse You think that's a recipe for disaster But the truth is it lets them be themselves because their authentic self comes out and you know, I've had so many experiences You know around one if I just blurted acted on impulse You know, I remember one woman I dated on the second date We were going to go for a walk and she said, well, let me go use the restroom Restaurant and she went to the restroom came back and I so I'm gonna go use the restroom I said by the way enjoyed watching you walk away from me And as soon as I said it, I thought oh fuck. I probably blew it, you know After we broke up we stayed friends and said Months later said you remember when you said that to me said, yeah, I thought I blew it He goes, oh no, I loved it. Well, I it I just blurted it right. I didn't hold it back I remember another another woman early early first date where we're walking and she said something about her Her sister or sister-in-law they're they're having a shoe party, you know, where women get together and Look at shoes The lamest thing a tupperware. I can think of the a shoe party lamest party in history But okay, and so I blurted without thinking oh shoe shopping is women's porn She turned and looked at me and she goes You get it you understand You know and and and so guys will say well, I'm not funny, you know, I'm not I'm not, you know, I can't I'm not talking about telling jokes I'm talking about whatever that thing that came to the tip of your brain But you held it back Yeah, because you're afraid it might be the wrong thing to say the wrong thing to do as soon as you held it back You killed the tension the putting it out there and sometimes you crash and burn, you know, there's the sweat flops You go, oh man, that didn't get one laugh, you know, but you got to take that risk every comedian You know has had plenty of bombs to but man that one landed and And it's not about trying to get it right. It's about taking the sensors off And letting that you that maybe just speaks to the obvious Out there and people people they'll relate to it or they won't it seems a lot like one of the key tactics for Rehabilitating a nice guy is learning to kind of get out of your own way That's a good way to put it because what we've been doing is again go all the way back to where we began this They've been trying to manage their shame. I'm bad. I'm not good enough. I'm gonna be found out. I'm gonna die Their anxiety. Oh, no, somebody will react negatively. There'll be pain involved And so that is what's driving the bus is their shame and their anxiety And so who is really in there? You know, who is the person? Um One of the things the comments I get from people that work with me or you know Come to my workshops or seminars or do calls with me. They'll say robert I appreciate how how authentic you are And I'll go Nobody would have accused me of that 30 years ago Nobody would have said robert. I love how real you are how authentic you are how you just share yourself How you share your mistakes you fuck ups. I didn't And and I couldn't attract a woman to save my life, you know back back in those days I I kind of could but I I didn't know that what I was what I did that might attract a woman But I wasn't real. I wasn't authentic. I was holding my finger up checking the wind I was a chameleon, you know, what's what's gonna give me the most laughs or what's gonna give me, you know What will kind of go over well, but not too well that you know now I'm not on the spot that I got to follow through and man to just take the sensors off and just Blurt act on impulse be you I think is such a powerful rehabilitation and since most nice guys Their sensors are the most prominent with women. That's a great place to go practice One of my the same friend I was talking about before mr. Orthogonal tennis game george He he has this idea called only the irrational behavior survives. What he's talking about What he's talking about is he imagines being at the funeral of somebody that he knows and he Thinks about the conversations that the people are having around the room and they're not having the conversation The washing was always folded and he turned up on time and all the rest of it He uses this example of his mum and he says that his mum hates fighting Just really just does not like physical fighting big big problem with it And once his brother was in the car his younger brother was in the car with her and they were driving somewhere and she I don't know 50s year old woman Normal british woman saw two 18 year old boys sort of squaring up to each other and pushing and trying to fight or whatever on the side of the On the pavement. She stops the car in the middle of traffic Gets out and runs over and the brother's like mum. What the fuck are you doing? Like what the two guys Twice your size and quadruply a testosterone. What the fuck are you doing? She runs over and she gets in between them physically gets in between them like no fighting no fighting Gets back in the car and the brother's like mum. That was Insane, you could have been hurt. You could be what she's I don't care. I don't care. I just don't like fighting no one's fighting and he said at her funeral People will say she was the sort of person that would stop the car in the middle of traffic to stop two boys fighting And it's like that only the irrational behavior survives is is similar to what you're talking about that there are rough edges to our personality and our behavior But ultimately that is our personality and behavior like if your goal your goal should not be as a person on this planet to smooth out any of the things that make you anything into this sort of vanilla amorphous blob that kind of like just glides Through it's like no you have things that you want to say and actions that you want to take and changes that you want to make And just the faith to be able to do that unencumbered is That's what life is. Yeah, and and it takes support. It takes practice um Yeah, you know talking no more mr. Nice guy about nice guys being teflon men No stick, you know, nothing. I don't want anything to stick to me But we do connect as you said around our rough edges, you know, what we remember about people might not even been always a thing It might even bugged us or got on our nerves when they did it and we're around them But it's also the thing we miss. I mean, you know Nala the pit bulls back at my my door again. I've got french glass doors so I can see her outside my office Yeah, you know when she barks during, you know, I'm on an interview a podcast It really bugs me but you know if I didn't have her and I'd notice Oh, I miss her bark You know, I love when she'd go crazy and let me know that somebody was out front our handyman The the water guys deliver a while they call my dog's name because they know she'll bark differently When she's had her name called and well and I would miss that if it if it ever went I go What's wrong with Nala? How come she doesn't bark at people outside anymore? Yeah, it's it's it's rough edges bore, you know, all that smooth get it right. No, you know, that's boring Why is your first sexual experience so important? You talking about mine Come on, even that's too far for me. Um, yeah First sexual experience. Why is it very formative? Okay, you know That That's a good question But it's also difficult one to answer because our first sexual experience is probably Conception, you know, I'd say birth. We're born sexual We're the the essence of who we are is sexuality every living thing is built to reproduce After its own so our sexuality is the essence of who we are We we kind of live culturally thinking well, you know, children don't become sexual until you know that particular age whatever that might be but the truth is, you know Little boys little girls discover their body parts that are very young age Oh, there's pleasure before you, you know, they understand the words of parents don't stop doing that, you know They're they're they're they're finding the pleasure in their own body parts And the essence of our psyche is is is our our sexuality, you know, if So many great teachers, you know all the way from from Freud To david data to osho to david snarch people at least i value talk about the the most profound way into who we are Young is to our sexuality because it is the essence of who we are. So to bring that back to answering your question I will often ask people like in a workshop, you know, again, I primarily work with men these days. Well I 100% work with men these days I'll ask them What was your earliest sexual memory and it doesn't matter what it was first time you notice you had an erection first kiss first wet dream First i'll show you mine. You show me yours first, whatever Uh, and it can vary for you every what but i'll just say what is your first memory? And then i'll say get it get clear in your mind. What was it? And then i'll ask them Did it occur in the open? Could you go tell your folks about it? Could it be celebrated? Did your parents say that's amazing. Let's go get pizza. That's a you know, it's a developmental milestone Um, or was it hidden? Was it secretive? Was it guilt-ridden? Was it shame-based? Uh, even worse. Did it feel good? But you felt bad about it feeling good All right, so For about 99.9 of the people on the planet our earliest sexual experience Was wrapped in shame And in hidden darkness guilt i'm bad. I can't let anybody find out So our sexuality gets cross-wired with those features It's bad it's evil hide it Repress it don't let it out and then that takes You know as many different forms as there are people in terms of how that manifests from from there So then we get to be adolescents and adults and can't figure out why Sex is so messy so difficult so challenging. So You know, how come isn't work how come how come it's not easy? Yeah, people who think that they have a a low sex drive Might actually just be psychologically scarred from The way that they perceived it That's very possible. I and I've I've often said, you know, I Will get personal I didn't discover I didn't know I could actually masturbate myself to Ejaculation until I was a freshman in college. That's pretty late compared to most and and you know I was kind of a late bloomer in a lot of ways around sexuality And I was just well, that's just me But yeah, it's very likely me growing up in a fundamental christian church where I heard messages really early That if you lust after a woman's breast you go to all you go to hell for all eternity You know where you know, my mom taught me to be not be like my dad Where you know, I listen to the women that he's a jerk. He only wants one thing, you know Yeah, there might have been some scarring that went into the you know, I'm trying to work out You know, it's better to not have a sex drive. Oh my penis betrayed me again by getting a wreck You know what stop doing that. You know, you know, I'm trying to work out from a first sexual experience My first the first time I had sex the girl who I worked with at the local Hotel where I was the room service boy Do you know what? uh fucking What was it? A vw loopo is a loopo loopo. It's like the site. It's smaller than a fee at 500 and it was three door and it was in a Uh, like an industrial estate halfway between did you have sex in the loopo? I had I If you think that having sex for the first time is difficult having sex for the first time in a car That's like half the size of a jumper just turns the turns the difficulty level up to 11 um, but yeah, I maybe maybe that's I don't know what that means. We were next to a Like a Mercedes bends mechanics. Maybe that's why I love f1 so much. I'm not sure I keep getting an erection whenever I see Lewis Hamilton I'm not sure Uh, we could really spend my my first attempt was in a chevy vega You know, it probably slightly bigger slightly bigger the next time I tried it. It was on a park school bus. I got smart, right? Yeah, very nice Very good. Well, I mean the school bus. Yeah, but um, yeah, it's It's it's very interesting to think about how we sort of internalize these stories And I had a do you know dr. Paul conty is so that was stanford. I've heard that name I couldn't tell you who he is but I have heard the name So he did a four-part series with andrew huberman last year. I've heard that name too. Yes. Yeah, so every everybody says that name all the time He's fantastic. They're both fantastic and um, paul does uh evidence-based unconscious work trauma and such from a very medical standpoint and um He was talking to me. He gave me this really lovely frame very interesting about how Formative experiences in our past Can reshape the way that we see the entirety of that world but importantly they reshape our Memory of what it was like before that as well so for us to say something like uh, I get in a car accident when I'm 25 and Then you get travel anxiety which causes you to not enjoy driving or to feel anxious when you're driving and then at 35 you tell yourself I've never liked driving you were like no until the age of 25 you loved it. Do you not remember you did that thing? It's like no no no I was anxious the whole time and this this ability that like the fallibility and the malleability of our memory and our sense of self and our understanding of ourselves um the fact that for sufficiently formative experiences can Like manipulate those and mold them in a different way. I just thought was so It's fascinating but kind of brutal as well Well, and maybe this is a the same another way of explaining the same thing Every time we recall a memory we fundamentally change the memory Because every time we recall it we're now in a different emotional state a different position different surroundings We Accurate memory does not exist Right, you know what even even as we think we're remembering our earliest sexual experience You know if there was actually a camera they're filming it We might find out it's completely totally different Surrounding wise than we thought so every time we recall a memory We're altering it. So our memories keep changing over a lifetime. So um but what but What happens at that trauma we're talking about and that what I call the cross wiring That's happening at an emotional level and so it doesn't matter even if our memory is accurate in terms of you know, digitally Accurate what what matters is emotionally How we move forward with it and so now if you know We've been a sexual creature since birth and all of a sudden something happens that sex is hidden Well, I better keep it hidden from from here on out and we don't make that as a conscious decision It's just an emotional roadmap that we start following Hmm It's very very interesting. Okay. So we identified this and people are sitting listening to you and I talking very openly about sexual experiences And they're going you're not supposed to do that You're not supposed to talk openly about those things because they're going on their emotional wiring of how you're supposed to you know Be about sex. Yeah. Well like the vw lupo opens all sorts of doors Um three of them exactly egg precisely correct unless you can clamber out the back honestly, dude I I and I remember how not far the passenger seat went back as well I just thought this is what and you got to do in the passenger seat because of the steering wheel But you guys have the steering wheel on the wrong side of the car Well, speak for yourself. Look, we've gone through this litany of problems, right? This big big big big list and We don't have enough time to prescribe the panacea for all of the nice guys listening given the fact that you've done so many seminars coaching sessions working with people What have you found if you were to give the biggest movers? of Rehabilitation for nice guys I don't think i've ever used that exact word for it What what what are the uh the practices? What are the places that they should focus on in order to start to embody themselves more honestly? Okay, yeah be their authentic selves exactly I'll just walk you through what I did number one. I tell people find safe people Don't try to do this on your own. You didn't become a nice guy in social isolation Don't try to get over it in social isolation We have to have safe people to start releasing our shame to tell people I've got this story about myself and people go That's not bad. That's not terrible at all. You're know, that's normal what you're describing So we need safe people to support us release our shame perhaps mentor us Encourage us help us face our fears. So I tell nice guys go find a coach therapist men's group. I love men's groups do A big chunk of my own personal Rehabilitation in in men's groups. Uh, I was leading five men's groups a week when I was in private practice up in seattle Um, I just I'm a believer so find men's group. Don't try to do this alone How do you suggest to interject there? How do you know if it's a good men's group or a bad men's group? That that's a good question and it is somewhat subjective because something a group you love might not work for me When I started looking for something about all that existed at that time was the uh, The robert blei methyl poetic go out in the woods beat a drum have the talking stick and say, oh I did that I ended up in a 12-step program is where I started it not wasn't by choice. It just where I landed Um, I got I got lucky. I landed and I was in a men's group led by a woman Around sexual shame who liked men and so that was good for me I tried some other men's groups that I just never connected or resonated with A core piece I would recommend whether you're looking for a coach a therapist a men's group Is find somebody who leads it who's actually done their own work You mentioned embodiment quite a bit somebody who's actually gone out worked on their own stuff You know, I I became a therapist. I got my phd in marriage and family therapy at 29 years old Started you know a few years later started doing, you know trying to do real therapy I'd never been to therapy And you know, it wasn't till I got into therapy and men's groups and started working on my own Toxic shame and my own anxieties and my own patterns that I could actually really help people So, you know, um, it doesn't hurt to check out, you know, ask the person What's your journey? You know, we're we're if you worked on yourself and then just see do you connect with them? Let's usually go place do you connect? So go go find a coach therapist men's group 12 step group something where you get to go start revealing you releasing toxic shame Start being honest nice guys think they're honest or anything but honest I remember pretty early in my process I realized almost everything I told my then wife was whatever won't rock the boat So I I told her I'm gonna work and be an honest whenever I catch myself Making up a story to tell you I'm gonna come tell you I was gonna lie to you. Here's the lie. I was gonna tell you. Here's the whole truth So I started doing that and actually I used to tell her her middle name ought to be overreact because that's What she did and every the funny thing was what actually just started telling her the truth about shit. She'd go, okay Thanks for telling me that I'm glad you didn't lie to me and you know, whoa, that's different You know when I was trying to get her not to overreact she did when I just told her the truth Yeah, okay, don't lie to me. That was it. So work on being honest and again, we need safe people usually to do that Work on making your needs a priority Sorry to ask yourself. What do I want? What's important to me? You know, am I do I do I need to go to the gym? Do I need to go to the dentist? Do I need to take some time to relax? Do I need to rest my eyes? Do I need to go read a good book?
