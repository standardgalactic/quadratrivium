0	4400	One of the things that we've spoken about privately that we haven't yet spoken about publicly is
4400	9360	victimhood. And James Cantor came on the show. He's a sex researcher. He gave me this really
9360	14240	interesting quote I wanted you to react to. Shifting from aiding victims to aiding everyone who
14240	19440	claims victimhood has led to an awful lot of charlatanism. Shifting from doing good to looking
19440	25120	good has led to an awful lot of virtue signaling. Their interaction is now western culture at
25120	30080	least online. What do you think about that? I think it's true. And if you think about,
30800	36880	you know, I believe people respond to incentives. That's fundamentally the driving force of all
36880	42240	human behavior. We respond to incentives. If you incentivize victimhood, you're going to get victims.
43680	51840	And I think online is really the shift that happens because the online world rewards it and
51840	56160	it also allows people to fake victimhood in a way that in person you can't really. Like if you see
56160	61040	someone living in a massive house, you go, well, you may be in victim in some ways, but you are
61040	66800	actually well taken care of here. But online, you can create any avatar you want. And that avatar
66800	71120	can be projected onto the online space from a mansion. And that's kind of where we are.
72000	78000	Yeah, the fact that our opinions are more important than our deeds and our words are scrutinized while
78000	82720	our actions are done in private. You know, how many people have we seen over the last few years?
82720	88240	Ellen DeGeneres, Lizzo, who's that late night host that just got popped for apparently being a
88240	95120	Jimmy Fallon, I think, allegedly has these people that outwardly are supposed to be
95760	101440	champion for the underclass, like I'm supporting women of all sizes or I'm supporting people that
102160	106160	have different sexual orientations or I do the whatever. And then you find out behind the scenes
106160	111520	that they can't even treat a PA with dignity. I don't know, it seems to me like
113040	120320	being someone who out front proselytizes about standing up for the underclass
120960	125200	is almost becoming a red flag to go. I probably should scrutinize what's actually going on behind
125200	130240	the scenes here. When I was a stand-up comedian in the comedy world, there's a golden rule of this.
130240	135680	The more a comedian talks about how he's a male feminist on stage, the sleazier he is backstage.
136640	141920	It's like a golden rule never fails, always the same. So anyone who goes on stage and talks
141920	146640	about how brilliant they are, they're always, always, always sleazy and evil behind the scenes.
146640	151440	It's just how it works. And I think it's actually, it's a kind of compensatory mechanism.
151440	155920	People who are hiding a bunch of shit have to go out and then pretend to be something they're not.
157040	163680	The morality sort of stands on the shoulders of this performative bullshit. Is there a solution
163680	168160	to this? Is there a way that we can scrutinize, given that people's deeds and their actions and
168160	175120	their words and their opinions are always going to be far apart? I think that we are living through
175920	181760	a digital revolution for which we're not prepared. Naturally, that's what revolution is, right? It's
181760	188080	a change in the paradigm of how we exist. So I think that 10, 15, 20 years from now, we will
188080	194160	look back at the way we use social media now and be horrified by it. It'll be a little bit like
194800	200640	tobacco companies promoting cigarettes as a healthy thing to do. And then we'll be like, whoa,
200640	204720	this was actually causing a lot of damage. So I think the answer to this is a healthier
204720	210480	relationship with the online world in particular. My hope is that we get past this stage and work
210480	215920	out how to use all of that stuff better. I see it in myself, the way I use social media now is
215920	222000	very different to the way I would have used it even two years ago. I'm much more responsible with
222000	226720	the way I use it. And I mean in terms of my own life, in terms of how much time I spend on them,
226720	233040	what I do, but also in terms of the way I act on social media, because I am trying to be more
233040	239440	responsible in what I say is very easy. And I think especially on X or Twitter, whatever you want to
239440	245920	call it, to get clicks. And I know exactly how to do that, which is dunk on somebody.
246480	250560	And I spend less and less of my time doing that now, because I don't think that makes the world
250560	255200	better. I don't think it makes me better. It's very rare on Twitter to have someone
256560	261440	break the fourth wall and say, that was out of order. You're not allowed to say that. Everybody
261440	269120	plays this sort of permanent game of sardonic tennis. Here's some blas√© comment about how you
269120	273840	suck at some smart snipe back at what you said. And oh, I hit it back across the net with something
273840	278480	else. No one actually says what they should say, which is that's fucking out of order.
278480	284240	And then you're approved if you do. This is why it's disincentivized. This is coming back to the
284240	289200	point about incentives. Social media rewards certain types of behavior and punishes others. So
289200	295520	if you're the guy that says, maybe we shouldn't pile on this person. If your team is doing the
295520	300240	piling on, you're like the one who's not willing. Do you know what I mean? You're not willing to
300240	306800	join in with stoning somebody. And that's why you're a loser. That's the model that we operate in.
306800	313840	So being responsible is disincentivized. I love this idea that an absurd ideological belief or
313840	319040	an extreme ideological belief is a show of fealty to your own side and a threat display to the other.
319920	327680	And the more absurd or extreme the belief, the more likely it is that your own side can trust
327680	333920	you and that the other side should fear you. Do you know what I mean? That if you have to put
333920	341360	reason and sensibility and common decency to one side in order to like, here I am holding my hand
341360	347120	in the air for whatever the current thing is, your own side sees you as a reliable ally.
347120	353200	And the other side sees you as a formidable foe. It's tribal mechanics, but multiplied by a thousand
353200	358000	because it's online. With everyone scrutinizing you. Yeah. And so you have these weird pathologies
358000	361920	like you've got, and it's not a comment on him personally, but you've got like a guy who lives
361920	367440	in Malaysia commenting on American cultural issues and getting like millions and millions of views
367440	372000	for his commentary and whatever. And he's going, I see what you're doing there, but are you actually
372000	377360	contributing to anything? Do you know what I mean? Because it's just flaming, fanning the flames of
377360	382960	whatever is going on. And I see that as a, you know, like I say, it's a period, it's a transitionary
382960	387760	period. I hope that we get to a point where we start to use social media in a different way.
387760	393200	And actually, you know, this is an unpopular thing to say, but I don't envy the big tech executives
394160	399120	because it's a really hard job. Because on the one hand, you incentivize to encourage engagement.
399680	406880	And on the other hand, the engagement is achieved by amplifying anger and division and all of these
406880	412320	things. So I hope we can work that out as a society. How do we move forward with social media?
412880	415840	What about the victimhood side of things then? You know, like it's kind of,
415840	419680	it's almost like old trope to talk about snowflakes and all this sort of bullshit. It feels like,
419680	426720	you know, five year ago, culture warrior, horse shit. But the underlying dynamic is still
427600	434720	there, that we've got this sort of tyranny of the minority in some regards, that fragility is
434720	439280	something to aspire toward, or at least it's something which is rewarded in a variety of
439280	443760	different ways. What's your sort of conception and framework of this with a little bit more
443760	448560	perspective that we've got now? Well, I'm going to be speaking at ARC Jordan's
448560	452320	thing later this year. And one of the things I want to talk about is that I think
452960	458800	everyone's embraced us now. We all now do it. I feel like those of us who have been concerned
458800	464560	about wokeness have sort of got into that place where we are like, I'm a victim, I've been cancelled,
464560	470240	I've been this and I've been that. And I think it's time actually for us to step into our power now
470240	475360	and go, okay, well, we've created these new media organizations, we've created alliances,
475360	479760	we've created community, we've created things. And the question really for us is now,
480240	485600	we know what we're against, but not enough people are willing to say, what are we for exactly?
485600	490800	And that's because it's much harder to do. But that is the mission now. It's how do you get past
490800	496320	woke, anti-woke into the future? And the future has to be about offering people a better alternative
496320	502960	to that victimhood, because it's more rewarding for the individual to see themselves in that way,
502960	508320	I think. And this is why Jordan Peterson was so successful when he broke through,
508320	514560	because he was saying to people, take responsibility. And I think we all actually now
514560	522560	are in a position where we have to say it to ourselves. Yes, the right wing snowflake sphere
522560	527760	that nobody really ever talks about. I'm pretty sure that you hate that even more than you hate
527840	538800	left wing snowflake sphere. Using the call out culture to say this is something that
538800	544480	shouldn't be happening, this is pedestalizing victimhood, so on and so forth. While some people
544480	549440	waving that exact same identity flag themselves, it's like, I don't know, man, that doesn't seem
549440	553600	like the way to go. No, it doesn't. I understand it, though. And I think people on the right
553600	559920	could quite credibly say that, well, they did this and now we're using the weapons that they
559920	564640	forged against them. It's understandable. But I'm interested in how do we move forward?
564640	568800	How do we move forward? And I think there's a hell of a lot of questions in modern society
568800	574480	about that that remain extremely unanswered. Where do you get meaning and purpose in your life?
575440	581440	Now, in a society that has fewer and fewer children in which young people are delaying
581440	588800	adulthood longer and longer and longer, where do you get meaning and purpose? Exactly.
588800	593520	For some people, that's online activism, but actually how fulfilling that is, I don't know.
593520	598560	So the big questions remain unanswered and perhaps increasingly so, actually. I think
600080	604800	there could well be an argument that 80 years ago, people had way more meaning and purpose
604800	610160	readily available to them at just through the course of normal life, get married, have kids,
610160	615600	whatever. Now, obviously, that wasn't universally available to everybody, et cetera. But I think
615600	622640	in the modern world, actually, way more people are lost. They don't know what they're supposed to do
622640	629120	exactly. So in the past, we had a set trajectory you're supposed to follow, which hurt some people
629120	633200	because it wasn't the trajectory for them. But when you take away all trajectory, then
633200	639600	everybody is lost. And I think a lot of people are in that position now. And as I said, I think
639600	645040	it's way harder to think about what the positive vision of the future is. But that, I think, is
645040	652960	the task now. That's the mission. If you think wokeness is stupid and dangerous and harmful,
652960	658720	which I do, well, what do you think in addition to that? What do you think beyond that? What is it
658720	664400	that you think people ought to do? If they ought not to be victims, what ought they to think about
664400	670480	with their lives? And that's a very difficult question that I have more questions than answers
670480	677920	about. It's way easier to identify problems than proposed solutions. And you almost see this on
677920	685200	the internet that if somebody identifies a problem, it's kind of hard to criticize a criticism. It's
685200	693520	possible, but it's way easier to criticize a proposal. And it's almost like a defense mechanism
693520	700480	that people have to front load or front run, avoiding the criticism that they know will become
700480	704480	will be incoming. It's the caveat. It's like, I'm not saying that we don't need to care about
704480	707520	such and such. And I'm not saying that this isn't a big deal, but maybe we need to think
707520	711760	about this thing. It's almost like a conceptual equivalent of that.
711760	715840	Yes. And I find myself doing that all the time. Fortifying with caveats.
715840	721520	All the time, man. Because I think the other aspect of the online, the way the communication
721520	727360	happens online is like, if you make a statement, a generalized statement, you might say exercise
727360	731440	is good for you. And somebody will be like, yeah, well, what if you've got an ear injury?
732400	737600	And before you know it, like you hate disabled people. That's kind of how the conversation
737600	743520	happens. But I think when we stop being able to make normative statements, everything else
743520	748960	breaks down. We have to be able to say, for most people, most of the time, pairing up with
748960	753760	someone of the sex that they are attracted to and building a life together is better than not
753760	758560	doing that. We have to be able to say that without the one person who was in an abusive
758560	763760	relationship. Well, what about me? Yes, we understand you, but we're talking about the 95%
763760	768640	of people, right? And you feel free not to go along with whatever we're putting on the table.
768640	771760	It's like, if we put a menu of things on the table, you don't have to eat everything.
771760	776160	No one is making you eat the gluten. It's the Ricky Gervais guitar lessons thing, right?
776160	780480	Exactly. So I think we have to be able to say
781920	786800	all other things being equal, family is good. This is the tyranny of the minority. I
786800	792880	fucking love that phrase. I think it's so smart to optimize for the edges of the bell curve rather
792880	798880	than the middle. And as you said before, it is important to recognize that there are people
798880	804640	who fall outside of the norms of normality and that they need some care as well. And if you
804640	808720	didn't have that sufficiently broad perspective view, these people would just fall through the
808720	813360	cracks and that's fucking shit. And nobody wants that to happen. But when you optimize for that,
813360	816960	you actually end up, if you were to net out what happens, you end up with more suffering because
816960	821120	you neglect all of the fucking fat bit of the middle of the distribution.
821120	826160	That's right. And we've stopped being able to make that point because we... And also,
826160	830240	I think the phrase that I came across and I didn't come up with this, but somebody was saying to me
831040	833840	the other day that we live in a world of trade-off denialism.
834800	835360	What does that mean?
836560	842960	Every decision has trade-offs. It has positives and negatives. And if you go, well, we should do
842960	847120	this and someone goes, yeah, but what about the thing that... And then you can never really
847120	852880	acknowledge. It's like the climate catastrophe. No one wants to talk about the fact that many
852880	859040	of the solutions that are being proposed would be worse than the problem. So it's like, if you say
859040	864560	anything about how we're approaching that issue, you are denying that climate change is real or
864560	868240	you are denying that it's a problem or you're denying that we should address it. No, I just
868240	873680	think your idea of how to fix it is stupid. And we've lost the ability to have that conversation
873680	877280	as well. And I think we'll really need to reintroduce. It's one of the things I talked about
877280	882240	in my Oxford speech, which I think is why it did well is because people went, oh, yeah,
882240	886400	all right, because if we just do the stuff that we've been told we need to do, that's actually
886400	892880	worse. And that sort of opened it up. I think we've totally forgotten that there are no solutions,
892880	895680	only trade-offs. My favorite quote ever from Thomas Sowell.
895680	900720	Yeah, it's lovely. And the difference between maximizing and
900720	905120	satisfying from behavioral economics is an interesting one. So maximizing is everything
905120	912320	must be 100, 100, 100, 100. Satisfying is hitting an acceptable level across everything.
912400	916800	And what the satisfying allows you to do is it allows you to iterate much more quickly.
916800	921280	And as you say, you can do it in your own life. It's like, how many times have you done it?
921280	927840	Going to go away on holiday with the misses. And we're going to have a fucking Airbnb or booking.com
927840	932960	favorite list with 30 hotels or 30 places in. And by the time that you get down to choosing them,
932960	936080	the choice has been made for you, because all of the nice ones have gone and you're now two days
936080	940480	before you leave. Right? That's maximizing. And you're so stressed, you need the holiday just
940800	943280	because it was awful. You didn't even enjoy the experience of it as well.
943280	945680	Yeah. Yeah. I understand, man, like, you know,
945680	949600	people feel like they're being left behind. They feel like life is happening to them
949600	954000	or happening for other people. And they're not a part of it. And I get that. Like,
954640	959520	you know, fucking, it's disquieting. Life is going on. My friends are moving on. The world
959520	965120	is changing. And I'm all confused. But I suppose this sort of information ecosystem
965760	970960	conversation, which you guys have had a good bit. And I've had twice over the last few weeks,
970960	977040	first with Sam Harris, and then with Eric Weinstein. What do you make of this? Like,
978240	984560	the heterodoxosphere has its problems. The legacy media sphere has its problems.
986160	990560	Independent creators that just get to shitpost anonymously on Twitter and Reddit. Also,
990640	995840	I like very unreliable. Do you think about this? Like, how all of this comes together
995840	999840	and how you move forward through it? I see a lot of problems with new media too.
999840	1003200	I mean, and I've said this from day one in terms of what we do at Trigonometry.
1003200	1010560	It's we don't have a budget to employ a bunch of people to do extensive research on things
1010560	1016560	or to do fact checking for us. So we can't do certain things that the mainstream media can do
1016560	1019760	and should do. The problem is the mainstream media isn't doing it either.
1021040	1025680	But there's a really important role for the mainstream media. I just wish they'd play that
1025680	1034400	role. But I think where I agree with Sam, even though I disagree with him on COVID and
1035120	1039280	to some extent, well, to a large extent, Trump and all those things, is not everything can be
1039280	1043920	fixed on a podcast. That is absolutely true. There are certain things that are a matter of
1044800	1049920	research and deeper study. And it's not everything can be sorted out in three
1049920	1054800	hour conversation between two podcasters. There's not how that works. And I think
1056240	1064880	new media has its own problems. It over rewards charisma. It over rewards passion.
1065760	1075520	It massively under rewards any attempts to cling to truth. It encourages people to go off
1075520	1080800	in the pursuit of the most exciting take. And truth isn't always exciting.
1081840	1086560	So I think the truth is we need a vibrant ecosystem in which all of these different
1086560	1091760	pieces play their own different roles, which is why I'm in favor of maximum freedom because
1091760	1097760	that's where you get everybody doing their thing. And then over time, people who want
1098560	1102480	wholesome content, if you like, when it comes to facts or information or whatever,
1102480	1109600	can seek it out because people aren't stupid. They will eventually see through someone being
1109600	1114160	super charismatic or whatever. They'll get to a point where they go, actually, what I'd like to
1114160	1118160	do is have a look at what different sources are saying about this and make up my own mind.
1118160	1122320	You saw with COVID, the mainstream media really suppressed a lot of very legitimate points of
1122320	1128160	view, a lot of important information. But then you get the response to that, which is to go
1128960	1134320	quite far off the other end. And I've ended up somewhere, what I hope is a kind of reasonable
1134320	1139360	middle ground between those two positions. There's a really great blog post by Gwinda Bogle,
1139360	1145280	gowinda.substack.com, one of my favorite writers, why you are probably an NPC. And he frames out
1145360	1151520	five different types of NPC. And the most obvious two, like sort of the mainstream NPC and the
1151520	1157040	contrarian NPC, he makes this really great point, which is that the contrarian NPC is no deeper
1157040	1162800	thinking than the mainstream NPC, they're just the inversion of it. And he uses the line of
1164400	1172080	being a black sheep might make you different, but you're still a sheep. And that allure, this sort
1172080	1179840	of romance of being the independent thought leader, maker, sense maker, person. I understand
1179840	1185600	why it happens. But yeah, reflexive contrarianism is no more nuanced than reflexive belief of the
1185600	1194240	hegemony. Yes. And I don't judge people for that because I think that's an element of my thinking.
1195920	1201920	I think it's very understandable, disillusionment with the way the institutions have been captured
1201920	1206240	or have been corrupted or perverted or whatever it is that's happened to them.
1207440	1214320	It is natural that that would produce an equal and opposite reaction. I encourage myself and other
1214320	1221760	people to go beyond that. I try as best I can. And to go, okay, well, we're reacting to this. This
1221760	1225840	is how we're behaving. What's the actual truth? Because that's where we started. We started from
1225840	1229360	the position that we cared about the truth. That's why we're so annoyed with the mainstream.
1230320	1235440	Can we find somewhere in between those two positions that actually is an attempt to find
1235440	1242400	that truth? And it's the case with everything. We've had a bunch of, we just had the co-founder
1242400	1248960	of Navara Media on Trigonometry, the far left YouTube, or maybe not far left, is a kind of
1248960	1253920	Corbinista supporting kind of people and others because we're trying to speak to different people
1253920	1259200	from different places and really get to what the bottom of is of different issues because
1259200	1263360	those perspectives are valuable too. One of the things that Sam brought up on the episode with
1263360	1272000	me was his infamous Twitter clip with you. What was the experience of that particular 180 seconds
1272000	1279840	catching fire like? You know, I felt terrible when that happened. Really, really terrible.
1280560	1286640	Because I've never been on the end of a Twitter shitstorm to that extent,
1287520	1294080	but it's not pleasant. No matter how strong-minded you are, whatever, there's a reason that
1294080	1298800	Rogan always says, don't read the comments, right? Like the great man Joseph Stalin says,
1298800	1305840	quantity has a quality all of its own. So there's only a certain number of negative comments you
1305840	1312560	can ignore until just the volume of shit becomes overwhelming. So my primary concern actually,
1312560	1320320	I don't know Sam well, but was for his well-being actually. I just worried how he would experience
1320320	1326160	that more than anything. That was my concern because our approach is always about giving a
1326160	1331200	guest an opportunity to reveal themselves in the best light possible. And for some people,
1331200	1337520	that light shines very brightly and can burn. But that's not our intention. We never go into
1337520	1342320	an interview with a desire to out somebody or expose somebody. It's not a gotcha.
1342320	1347600	It's not a gotcha. So I was worried about him. And I emailed him straight away just to check
1347600	1353040	up on him. And also, we didn't put that clip out. We could have done because we obviously
1353040	1356880	understood that it was a controversial thing he said. And actually, most people don't know this,
1356880	1361200	but that was not the most controversial thing he said in that interview, in my opinion.
1361200	1366080	We talked about COVID on locals, which was the paywall section of the interview,
1366080	1369040	and what he said there, I found quite... What did he say?
1369040	1373120	I don't remember the wording of people who have to go and watch it, but I came away from that
1373120	1378320	thinking that he's overestimating the threat. And as a result of that, I was prepared to do
1378320	1385600	some pretty drastic things or demand drastic things to be done. So first and foremost,
1385600	1388880	as somebody who interviews people for a living, I was concerned for him,
1389840	1395920	but I also felt that what he said was wrong. I didn't agree with it.
1401920	1406880	My view on it is that if you overestimate the nature of the threat, all else follows. And I
1406880	1413280	think on Trump and COVID, that is where Sam, in my opinion, is... Well, that's why he's doing what
1413280	1420240	he's doing and saying what he's saying, because if I thought Trump was as bad as Sam thinks,
1420240	1425040	it'd be very tempting to think along the lines that Sam thinks along. And likewise with COVID,
1425040	1434160	if I thought this was like Ebola that spreads, I'd also be... We should also be honest. The
1434160	1439040	conversation, people were like, well, there's never, ever, ever any reason for the government
1439040	1445200	to mandate vaccines. And I broadly agree with that, unless the disease is really dangerous and
1445200	1451680	deadly. I said this at the beginning of COVID. Imagine that the disease had 100% mortality
1451680	1456000	rate for all women, or it was 100% mortality rate for all people under the age of 10.
1456000	1462160	Maybe some people would support it. Well, yeah, but I think that the... Fundamentally,
1462160	1467440	it came down to a risk and reward equation. And most people considered that the risk of getting
1467520	1475040	COVID was not greater than the risk of either getting the vaccine or of opening up mandated
1475040	1479200	vaccines as a pathway overall, right? And it's just, where do you sit on this equation? There's
1479200	1484800	lots of other things, but broadly, I think it's where do you sit on this equation. And Sam,
1484800	1493120	I completely agree with him that I think COVID, as an event, was like the worst kind of vaccine that
1493120	1498320	we could have given our epidemiology, our medical system, the view of vaccines overall.
1498320	1502880	Vaccine skepticism at large, I bet, has gone through the fucking risk.
1502880	1504080	It has. It has.
1504080	1505040	Have you had a look at this?
1505040	1510080	Yeah, of course it has. I know anecdotally, just speaking to people, how much that's the case,
1510080	1510400	yeah.
1510400	1514640	So if we are to have something that comes around the next time, and it does kill fucking all
1514640	1519280	children under 10 or all women or whatever the fuck, it's got some incubation period of 28 days
1519280	1525520	and a mortality of 40%, it's just a Psyop. It's another Psyop. This is Klaus Schwab doing it again.
1525520	1531520	This is the WEF. And it's like, oh, God, like that's, that's, it literally would have been
1531520	1536000	better if COVID hadn't happened, right? Sure enough, we can get masks out of the way more
1536000	1540240	quickly. And we've got like some, some inefficiencies in the system were opened up.
1540960	1547360	But if you were to look at COVID as a like operational logistical vaccine, our response
1547360	1553680	to it failed us way worse than if we'd never got it at all. And we got a vaccine injury from COVID.
1553680	1558800	Yes. Yes, we did. And, and I also think the one thing that is sort of inexplicably neglected
1558800	1565200	in all of this is I'd really like to know where COVID came from. I'd really like to know, don't
1565200	1568640	you think that's important? Don't you think we should know where it came from? Because there
1568640	1576720	are some credible assertions about its origins that would suggest that we may have another pandemic
1576720	1583440	soon. Is that right? I haven't seen this. Well, if this came from a lab in Wuhan,
1584160	1589040	because of gain of function research, and we are not willing to be honest about that,
1590320	1594400	and gain of function research continues, why wouldn't we have another pandemic?
1594400	1598320	I never looked into this much. I know that Sam had Matt Ridley and somebody else,
1598320	1601520	somebody else on his show. We've had Matt on to talk about this as well. Okay, cool.
1601520	1607120	And the truth is, we don't know. But I'm using the kind of the smell test here because
1607760	1616720	I grew up in a communist society. And what communist societies do when there is something,
1616720	1620800	and all societies do this to a large extent, because people don't like to expose their own
1620800	1624960	flaws. And no one wants to be like, oh, I was responsible for killing millions of people,
1625920	1633520	but they will cover it up in a way that is proper. And Matt actually gave this example of
1633520	1638720	there was a leak somewhere in the Soviet Union, which was a radioactive leak, I think, or maybe it
1638720	1644240	was a biological, and they covered up for ages. And then when the Soviet Union collapsed, we finally
1644240	1650800	found out, no, no, it was actually a leak. So if this is a product of gain of function research
1650800	1655360	getting out into the real world, which is credible, that there's very credible assertions about that,
1655920	1662960	the world needs to know, and this type of research needs to end. But if we are unwilling to have that
1662960	1666560	conversation, honestly, and do the proper investigations, which would be difficult because
1666560	1670880	the CCP wouldn't want that. And on top of that, you've got all this other bullshit about how it's
1670880	1677840	racist and all of that, we've got a problem. So I think my worry with everything that's
1677840	1683840	happened with COVID is not only have we not learned the lessons, I feel like, like you said,
1683840	1689200	we've got a vaccine injury from the experience, and everyone is sort of stuck in their corner.
1689200	1692560	And like Sam said, to you, everyone's got their own facts about it now.
1692560	1696240	Correct. That's a problem.
1698160	1704960	It's interesting what you said about the felt sense of being in the blast radius of Sam's
1704960	1712240	online experience. I noticed it, is someone called it Sam Harris's World Embarrassment Tour,
1712240	1715200	because he did my show, he did Steven's show, and he did Tom Billu's show.
1716640	1722640	And I don't know, man, like, there seems to be something, it's almost like there was resentment
1722640	1727200	sat on the internet, latent resentment sat on the internet waiting for Sam to fuck up.
1728000	1730640	And then he did a thing, or maybe maybe it's right.
1730640	1734880	I don't think it was personal. That was the reason I paused there. I don't think it was
1734880	1740240	personal to Sam. I think, particularly on his Trump comments, there are a lot of people who were
1740240	1747520	like, this is what we always knew the Trump haters think deep inside. And Sam was willing to vocalize
1747520	1754400	it, which is, I don't care how big the transgressions are on the other side. I don't care what Hunter
1754400	1759600	Biden has done. I don't care what Joe Biden has done. No matter what they do, it can never be as bad
1759600	1766800	as Orange Man bad. And that's sort of how he came across. And so the people who felt gaslit this
1766800	1775600	entire time about, you know, the overestimation of the threat of Trump, they were vindicated in
1775600	1780720	that moment. And I think Sam just was caught in the rage of people feeling like-
1780720	1782880	They're kind of like the perfect time storm. Yes.
1782880	1788320	With the perfect pebble in the perfect river that directed it. Yeah, it's so interesting,
1788400	1794800	man. I had this conversation with a fitness influencer called Sarah Safari in LA a couple
1794800	1798720	of weeks ago. I'd be interested to get your thoughts on this. I think it's analogous to this Sam
1798720	1806560	situation. A lot of people, especially right of center, say things like, you can't judge somebody
1806560	1815760	on just one thing that they say. Yet, when it came to a six pack of Bud Light being sent to
1815760	1823280	Dylan Mulvaney by some marketing intern somewhere deep in the annals of the Anheuser-Busch thing,
1823280	1828640	or Miller Light release one video, the Miller Light thing felt a little bit more produced.
1828640	1832240	It's probably gone through a few more layers. But largely, I just wondered, I thought it was
1832240	1839760	interesting that the charity that a lot of people right of center ask to be given to their
1839760	1844800	commentators or, you know, their champions that are canceled for taking out of context points.
1844800	1849600	There was that Rosanne Bar bit with Theo Von, where she made a joke about the Jews,
1849600	1854720	which was the most egregious clipping that I've ever seen from anything ever,
1854720	1860320	the end of a three minute long bit. And they took the final 30 seconds and put it up as if it was
1860320	1867360	representative of the whole thing. It was so fucking bad. But I did notice nobody decided to
1867360	1873920	use that same idea about, hang on a second, maybe this is just one small department in one small
1873920	1879920	corner of one small brand's marketing push. And they gave this person who is very unpopular on
1879920	1884880	the internet, a six packet Bud Light. And before you know it, Kid Rock's got an AR15 pointed at
1884880	1892640	a few cases of your drink. What do you think about? So I would separate those two out. So Sam, I think
1893840	1897680	that point applies very much. And this is the angle I'm coming from. And by the way,
1897680	1902080	we're about to go back to America and we'll interview Sam, the sequel. So we'll see how that
1902080	1905520	works out. I'm looking forward to it. But with Sam, what I felt was,
1906560	1910880	for me, I don't know if it's true of other people, but for me, Sam has a lot of credit in the bank
1910880	1919200	with me. And so I felt that while I strongly disagree with what he said, and I think that was
1919200	1926560	clear in the interview, he has enough credit in the bank with me that I'm willing to have a lot of
1927360	1932640	understanding and a lot of grace with him. And what I would say as well is,
1933760	1937360	we were having a lot of tech issues on the day that we interviewed Sam and he sat there for
1937360	1942080	like a good hour while we were trying to scrambling to get the microphones to work. And he was the
1942080	1949200	most decent human being that we've had on the show. You see who someone really is when the cameras
1949200	1952720	aren't rolling. That seemed to me like a really important thing that other people obviously
1952720	1959600	wouldn't have seen. So I have a lot of time for Sam and respect for him. I don't have the same
1959600	1967040	relationship with Dylan Mulvaney. And I also think- You haven't taken a world of wisdom from
1967040	1973280	Dylan Mulvaney over the last few- You'll be surprised, man. You'll be surprised. And so I think, look,
1973280	1979040	Dylan Mulvaney is a symbol to many people, like Sam is a symbol to many people for different things.
1979040	1984000	But I think it's a slightly different issue because, I don't know if you saw, but immediately
1984000	1990080	after the Dylan Mulvaney controversy, the marketing executive who was responsible for this,
1991200	1995680	there was a video of her talking to, I think, a reporter about the thinking behind
1997200	2000800	what the idea there was. Because it seemed a little bit more thought out.
2000800	2007280	It was thought out and her angle was our customers are shit. That was her angle.
2007920	2015360	Our shit. What's a shit customer? Well, it's just these guys who've got an old-fashioned sense of
2015360	2020480	humor. Do you know what I mean? We're going to educate our customers. And I'm like, you sell
2020480	2027120	beer. That's not your job. Sell them the fucking beer and shut up. And look, the trans issue for
2028000	2032080	reasons I actually think are quite understandable and obvious is the lightning rod of our time.
2033040	2037360	So, I'm not surprised that that caused the reaction that it did. And I understand it.
2038240	2045760	I do think, and I wrote a substack on this at the time, that perhaps the giving so much attention
2045760	2050880	to it is what prompts these brands to go down this route. Obviously, with Dylan Mulvaney,
2050880	2054080	it backfired for sure. It's a role of the dice for attention.
2054080	2057280	It's a role of the dice for attention that I don't think they'd consider. And I think that
2057360	2062240	executive ended up being fired. I do understand why people got as fired up about it as they did,
2062240	2067280	because you're rewarding behavior that a lot of people would feel is the wrong behavior to reward
2067280	2074000	in the public eye. Dylan Mulvaney. But that woman is one lady. Maybe in her interview with the
2074000	2077760	reporter, she said, this went all the way up and the director, CEO, the fucking chief marketing
2077760	2084240	officer or whatever was involved in this. But if it wasn't the case, I don't... If it turned out
2084240	2090000	that it was one small group in the corner, as I guessed or whatever, I don't think that the
2090000	2095280	internet would have given Bud Light any more leeway. I don't think they would have said,
2095280	2099840	we need to separate the art and the artist here. They've made beer for three decades,
2099840	2105680	for however fucking long it's been around. And maybe it's right. Maybe it shows their
2105680	2112080	woke bona fides. It shows that they're the man-hating, left-leaning, blue-head cucks that they always
2112080	2121360	were. But I don't know. It seems like a lot of the time people want... It's a smart idea to be able
2121360	2127360	to say, Rogan has been in a few controversies over the last few years. Most people said,
2127360	2132640	I have faith that you're telling me this is the tip of the iceberg. I've seen the whole iceberg.
2133360	2138080	I know that there is nothing lurking deep down in the depths. Massive advantage he has is he's
2138080	2144720	published like 5,000 hours of content over the last decade, which means that you have a pretty
2146000	2151040	good body of evidence that sits on the other side of the scale. But you don't know much about what's
2151040	2154080	going on inside of the marketing department. But I just thought it was interesting. I thought that
2154080	2159760	maybe this is a time where it would be illustrative and you should be careful about transgressing
2159760	2165600	rules that you want to be enforced. So if you want the don't judge somebody by one single occurrence
2165600	2172560	rule to be enforced and then you don't enforce it, that, as you said before, that tit for tat game,
2172560	2176400	it opens up what they did it. So this is playground mentality.
2176400	2180640	I understand what you mean, but I think I disagree actually. I think the reason that people
2181440	2188560	were as upset about as they are is while these are different companies, the sense is... Imagine
2188560	2193520	it wasn't just Rogan who said something, but it was Chris Williamson and Trigonometry and all the
2193520	2199680	other podcasters who do what we do all at one point said the same thing. And then there was yet
2199680	2203360	another example of a podcaster saying it. So when you look at the Gillette
2205360	2210880	Mattoxic Masculinity ad, if you look at all the other instances where corporations put pride
2210880	2215120	flags, they replace their brand with pride. But not in the Middle East. Well, obviously not.
2216160	2219920	Do they do it in Russia? They can't do it in Russia either. I doubt it. I doubt it. I can't imagine why.
2220000	2226960	Mother Russia gay has you. Yeah, exactly. So I think what people felt was here again,
2226960	2232480	we've got a corporation just absolutely taking the piss, lecturing the ordinary public,
2232480	2239200	and thrusting these very niche issues onto what is a very, very like normal household
2240080	2244480	beer. And you just can't escape this shit. That's what I think people feel.
2244480	2247040	So it's kind of a straw that broke the camel's back. I agree.
2247120	2251280	Big corporation overall. That's interesting. Because what I was doing was I was taking
2251280	2257040	Bud Light as a individual instance on its own. What you're saying is this is more endemic
2257040	2262560	of a broader trend among big corporations. Well, broadly speaking, if you think about what the
2262560	2267440	anti-woke narrative is, the anti-woke narrative is, and I agree with very large parts of it,
2267440	2272640	is that most of the major institutions, whether that be media, whether that be the civil service,
2272640	2280320	whether that be the political systems, the parties, the corporations, the education system,
2280320	2285760	they've all been captured or corrupted or through some other mechanism become
2287120	2291760	the projectors of a certain worldview onto the public who do not share that worldview.
2292480	2299440	And so when you see the toxic masculinity Gillette ad, which is like, hey, you're a man,
2299440	2307920	you're a piece of shit by a razor. You're a piece of shit by a beer, et cetera.
2308480	2311760	It sort of builds up to a point like, why is everyone telling me I'm a piece of shit?
2312880	2320720	And it gets old. And particularly this anti-masculinity narrative that you see
2321360	2327760	everywhere in movies, in advertising, in all sorts of different genres,
2328560	2333600	I think it's really, really dangerous because if you think about Gillette ads in the 90s,
2333600	2336800	you're a bit younger than me. I don't know if you remember them, but they were
2336800	2342080	the best a man can get. And it's like some blonde hot chick in like a whatever. She's like
2343120	2348640	actually that wasn't the 90s Gillette ads. The 90s Gillette ads were a bunch of men
2349440	2356160	being healthy masculinity. It was a man putting his tie on as he holds his baby up before he's
2356160	2363440	going to work. It was a man hugging his son on his way to his wedding. It was a man protecting his
2363440	2368880	wife. It was a healthy view of men and relationships and men and women and so on.
2370320	2376000	And I sort of say healthy masculinity is the 90s Gillette ads. That's what it looks like.
2377200	2382400	Men being responsible, men in relationships with women being respectful, being kind, but also being
2382400	2388320	strong, looking after their children, teaching younger versions of men how to be men, etc.
2389440	2395600	And I understand why people, men and women are fucking tired, really, really tired of this idea
2395600	2401840	that men are bad and evil. I always say my wife is completely apolitical and as a result of that
2401840	2409120	extremely based. She hates this shit and I can't tell you how many women I speak to
2409120	2412640	who are very, very tired of men being demonized in this way and so am I.
2413200	2415360	Especially given that a lot of those women will have sons.
2416400	2420400	And they want their partner to be good and healthy. They don't want them to be feeble,
2420400	2426240	you know. So I actually, I understand the pushback against that I really do and I think it's necessary.
2427120	2433920	Yeah, I mean, I've spent a lot of time talking about modern masculinity and the challenges that
2433920	2439920	everybody is facing. What do you think, like looking at it from your perspective, growing up
2439920	2445680	where you did in a communist country, coming here at 13, remember that, coming here at 13,
2447520	2451040	do you think the conversation around modern masculinity from both sides of the fence is
2451040	2457440	missing? Like what don't they understand about being a man in 2023 and the challenges and the
2457440	2462240	way that the culture sees them? I think we should zoom out more, even more than that and ask the
2462240	2472240	question, what is it that we want as a society? And I pissed both sides of the spectrum off by saying
2472800	2479360	what I'm about to say, which is any ideology, and I mean any ideology, that pits men against women
2479360	2485120	or women against men is toxic and damaging and dangerous and unhealthy. And that includes
2485120	2490000	some forms of feminism and that includes, you know, the incel worldview and all sorts of things.
2490000	2496480	So the thing that we're really missing is a reminder of the fact that I'm going to do the caveat
2496480	2500640	thing we talked about. Yes, some people are not heterosexual, but for the vast majority of people,
2500640	2504640	the single most meaningful thing in your life is going to be the relationship you have
2504640	2511040	with your intimate partner, almost always of the opposite sex, right? And we need each other.
2511040	2518240	Men and women need each other. We've been working together for millennia and anyone who tells you
2519040	2524320	that your enemy is the opposite sex, that person is your enemy. That person is your enemy,
2524320	2529040	that person is my enemy, and that person is our society's enemy. They are destroying or
2529040	2534960	attempting to destroy the very building block of our society. That comes from both sides of
2534960	2546080	the advice as well. Yes. The red pillar sphere teaches men that women are adversaries to be
2546080	2550960	avoided or resources to be used and discarded. Those are the only two ways. And, you know,
2550960	2556160	that's black, that's the entire man's sphere, actually. That's black pill, migthau, incels,
2557040	2563840	pick up artistry, red pill, sigma male, all the way, like the full, that's the entire gamut for
2563840	2567760	anyone that doesn't know the memes. That's the entire memeosphere of the fucking man's sphere.
2567760	2572960	And yeah, there's no one in there, very, very few people in there who say,
2573280	2579520	you're supposed to be a collaborator with the opposite sex. Most of your competition is
2579520	2585360	intracexual, not intersexual. Men and women have worked together for eons. You need each other
2585360	2590880	to survive, just because you've outsourced protecting and provisioning to the police
2590880	2597440	department and the local supermarket. And you women have outsourced the resources
2598000	2605600	and the company to your ability to gain education and employment and Netflix.
2607040	2611280	Still, broadly, we're not going to be able to out-technology ourselves from the last
2611280	2617680	120,000 years of humans being the way that we are. There's more to relationship than dildo,
2617680	2621200	right? You're not a dildo to your partner. There's more that you bring to the table.
2621200	2626320	Sometimes. Well, I'm speaking for myself, maybe I'm not sufficient in that department. But
2626320	2630080	my point is, let's frame this in a positive way. What is it that we're trying to say?
2630080	2634640	Well, what you're trying to say is men and women need each other. Men and women need to work together.
2635200	2642400	Men and women are not enemies. The most powerful you are ever going to be is with a
2642400	2644880	good woman by your side. What do you say to the people that go,
2645520	2652080	this is Treadpill nonsense, like Treadcon talking point 101. This is just another NPC
2652080	2657840	meme but coming from someone that's steeped in a type of relationship that men or women
2657840	2661040	don't need anymore. Well, you know how Bitcoin is saying have fun staying poor?
2661600	2667760	Have fun being a loser. You want to spend your life being unhappy with the opposite sex,
2667760	2672240	whether you are a feminist or one of these people, go for it. I'm not going to tell you
2672240	2675760	how to live your life, but I don't think it's going to lead you to a good place.
2676480	2683600	You know, I have male friends who've recently found their soulmate or their partner and they
2683600	2691440	blossom. They blossom the moment that it happens because we evolved to be together. We evolved
2691440	2698000	to work together. We evolved to drive each other forward in really powerful ways. I wouldn't be
2698000	2703040	a 10th of the man I am without my wife. Did you read the post I put up a couple of weeks ago
2703040	2708800	about the fuck you family? No, I didn't see that. So fuck you money, right? You're able to become.
2708800	2710080	Oh, I did see that. Yes.
2710080	2713520	It's sufficiently financially independent that money, you don't need to do things you
2713520	2716960	don't want to do. Fuck you freedom. You don't need to do things that you don't want to do.
2716960	2722560	But then the final stage I see amongst my male friends who are, you know, 30s and 40s
2722560	2729760	is the fuck you family, which is a all that I fundamentally care about in the end is me
2729760	2736560	and the people that are a part of this nuclear pod and everything else can go to hell.
2736560	2739600	Everything else can fall apart. Jimmy Carr was just sat in that seat.
2739600	2744720	He's been through his fair share of like roller coasters and he's been with his partner
2744720	2748400	like a decade and a bit like fucking forever, like maybe even 20, like 20 something years.
2748400	2754800	And now he's got a son and a daughter and yeah, the coming home to know that as long as that's
2754800	2758880	okay, as long as that's set and presuming that you've stacked the fuck you money with the fuck
2758880	2764080	you freedom and then you add the family on top, it must be kind of similar to being indestructible.
2764080	2768240	I'm still working on the fuck you money. It's still a long way to go on the fuck you money.
2768800	2771040	The freedom and the family. The freedom and the family, yes.
2772080	2779120	My wife and I, we met by complete accident when we were 18, married by 20 and been together
2779120	2785760	ever since. And just on a very practical, like what did I get out of it level,
2786320	2792560	it's been the single most beneficial source of inspiration, comfort,
2794080	2801440	pick each other up when you're down, all of that. I mean, I admire people who don't have that and
2801440	2805600	still do lots of stuff in the world, but it would be so much harder, so, so much harder.
2806720	2810320	So again, I'm not telling other people how to live their life. I'm just saying
2811280	2816560	this has been one of the most tried and tested solutions to various problems that human beings
2816560	2822480	experience throughout history. We evolved to be together. And if it's a trad talking point,
2822480	2827200	then maybe that's right. Maybe that some trad talking points are correct.
2827200	2831040	Getting back to the masculinity conversation, why do you think it's so difficult for people to
2831040	2834320	publicly advocate for the problems of men and boys?
2836240	2839360	Because victimhood doesn't work for men the way it works for women.
2839360	2843200	We don't feel sorry for men. And rightly so, by the way.
2844320	2847600	Rightly so. I mean, biologically, men are disposable in a way that women aren't,
2847600	2852640	for the obvious reasons. If you have a tribe of 10 men, 10 women, you send the women off to war,
2852640	2856240	you're screwed, you send the men off to war, one comes back, you can still replenish
2856240	2860160	the population. So men are disposable, always will be, much more than women.
2860960	2866720	And so we don't feel sorry for men in the same way. And I'm not advocating that we feel sorry
2866720	2871920	for men because I don't believe that's the solution to men's problems. The solution to
2871920	2874800	men's problems is for men to be better. What does that mean?
2875760	2881360	It means, you know what I mean. Look at you. This is what your entire life is spent on bettering
2881360	2886800	yourself physically, emotionally, psychologically, mentally. You're obsessed with performance.
2886800	2891280	You're obsessed with being better. You're obsessed with being happier, more fulfilled,
2891280	2893840	all of these things. It's a pursuit of your own greatness.
2893920	2898560	There are structural disadvantages that are faced by men as well, right, that very few people
2898560	2905040	are willing to accept at the moment. Socioeconomically, men are falling behind, education, employment,
2905920	2910000	mental health, we're currently suicide awareness, suicide prevention week in the UK.
2911040	2913520	According to one of the guys I was literally talking to, half an hour ago,
2914240	2917760	if you are a man, the single biggest threat to your own life is yourself.
2918880	2922800	You are more likely to die by your own hands than by any other way.
2922800	2927760	Are you? Am I? I've got suicide in my family, so...
2927760	2930560	I know, but I don't think you are the greatest threat to you.
2930560	2931360	That's true, but...
2931360	2933600	And I'm not the greatest threat to me, and why is that?
2934160	2936400	Not everybody has the same genetic predisposition.
2936960	2942880	Sure, but you just said you do, and yet you're not the greatest threat to you. Why is that?
2942880	2948000	Because you're fulfilled, because you are successful, because you're striving and achieving,
2948000	2951280	because you have in life what you should have in life,
2952400	2955200	the meaning and purpose and the pursuit of a goal, right?
2955200	2959760	And for men, this is one of the problems with this mental health conversation.
2959760	2964240	One of the reasons that men's mental health is not as good as it could be is that,
2966240	2970800	A, we do live in a society which discourages them from being men,
2970800	2972880	and being the way that men are supposed to be.
2973840	2979600	But the other reason is that most of the personal development and psychology fields
2979600	2986720	are geared towards female ways of being, and most of the ways that we treat, for example,
2986720	2991040	depression, men don't need the same thing as women do when it comes to that.
2991040	2994800	What men need is to feel powerful and capable, right?
2994800	3001680	The reason you are not the greatest threat to you is that you feel in charge of your life,
3002160	3005760	right? And that's what men need to pursue with every fiber of the being.
3005760	3009440	That's what I mean when I say better. You need to struggle, and you need to fight,
3009440	3013840	and you need to achieve. And then all of this other shit falls by the wayside,
3013840	3017360	and it's always been like this. I'm someone who's been depressed at points in my life,
3017360	3021360	and it's not because I was having a mental health problem, it's because my life was shit,
3022080	3028880	and I was shit. That's why, right? So what men need is to pursue their dreams,
3029520	3035040	to fight and struggle and to achieve. There was a point that you brought up earlier on about how
3036080	3044960	no guidelines is liberating and terrifying altogether. And I think it's interesting to talk
3044960	3051440	about how there isn't only one way to be a good man, but there aren't an unlimited number of ways
3051440	3058080	either. And the problem of breaking open the expectations around men means that guidance
3058080	3064320	for men and boys also largely dissipates. I had this conversation in Qatar, and the guy I was
3064320	3068320	debating had this conception of the man box. And he said, if you're inside of the man box,
3068320	3072800	it can be constraining because he was a member of the LGBT community,
3072800	3077440	Kuwaiti American group in the Middle East and wanted to be a dancer as a boy. I imagine it's
3077440	3082240	pretty fucking difficult for you to find a man box that fits that conception of you in it.
3082240	3082880	Sure.
3082880	3085920	But if you completely blast it open and you can be anything that you want to be,
3086720	3091120	there's no guidelines at all. There's no guidance. So how fucking hard is this going to be? You've
3091120	3097360	got to reinvent from first principles what it means to be a man. And I mean, you've heard this
3097360	3103600	from Mary Harrington and Louise Perry, but a lot of the guidance that was given to men previously
3103600	3110240	around chivalry, it is simply a difference of degree, not a difference of kind to go from
3110240	3113760	men should hold the door open for women and make sure that she gets the front door safe at night
3113760	3120160	to you shouldn't hit your wife. It is one single thread between those, which is women
3120160	3127840	are more vulnerable and should be protected, right? Lovely conception that Mary in classic
3127840	3135760	Mary style said the bourgeois rules that benefited women who had had a partner that
3135760	3140080	grew up in a two-parent household that went to some highfalutin institution,
3140080	3145520	was around people that had good male role models. Yeah, sure. You can break open the doors of
3145520	3150160	chivalry and maybe pay for the first date or maybe you can drive yourself home or get the
3150160	3154000	taxi on your own or whatever it is, because the environment that you're in is largely very different.
3155280	3160240	The guy that grew up or the woman that grew up in a relationship with a man who comes from a
3160240	3165760	single-parent household whose mom or dad was addicted to alcohol or drugs or there was multiple
3165840	3169920	partners coming through the house, they never got taught not to beat your wife,
3169920	3174960	let alone not to hold the door open. And like the rules for the, but not for me, it's like
3174960	3181680	the rules for us protect everybody, not just me. And yeah, I think it's a really interesting
3181680	3187600	frame to think about where the cultural changes come from. A lot of the time they come top down,
3187600	3191840	but the environment can be so different that getting rid of something that seems quite innocuous
3191840	3196000	up here can actually cascade down to the bottom. And the same thing goes for this tyranny of the
3196000	3200320	minority again. Absolutely. There are people that will be outside of the man box and maybe we
3200320	3206240	should expand it so that they can fit in it. But if you blow the doors open, where's the guidance?
3206240	3209840	Like what does it mean? And this is also a consequence of luxury beliefs, which is Rob
3209840	3216080	Henderson's term. I'm sure you've had him on the show. And the principle luxury belief of our time
3216080	3221200	is there's no difference between men and women. That's a luxury belief. There are people who
3221200	3225440	can afford to have it, but most people can't afford to have that belief. And then all else
3225440	3229840	follows from this. Because if you accept that there are differences between men and women,
3229840	3235520	then men and women should act differently. And that also means that it's okay for men to be men,
3235520	3242080	and it's okay for women to be women. One of the things that I find really fucking weird, man,
3242080	3250720	since we had our son is people will go to my wife, oh, you're just at home. And I'm like,
3250720	3256240	what do you mean just at home? Are you fucking insane? She's raising our son
3258480	3265600	and providing everything that we need as a family. And that you're calling that just a thing.
3267360	3274320	But a lot of women will judge other women for just being at home. And actually, I think,
3275280	3281120	and it doesn't apply to everybody, caveat. But for most women, the greatest gift their partner
3281120	3285280	can give them is opportunity if they want to be at home with the children to do that.
3285280	3290240	About 85% of women say that being a stay-at-home mum is an opportunity,
3290880	3294160	an option that they aspire to have. Yes. And financially, for most people,
3294160	3300320	it's very difficult right now. So it's the greatest gift. And so it's not just like men
3300400	3306640	are treated badly or women, it's this whole dynamic hurts everybody. And so men and women
3306640	3311040	need to work together. Dads need to be involved in their kids' lives. These are some, yeah,
3311040	3314480	they look their trad points one-on-one, if that's what you want to call them. But it's what works.
3315040	3317520	It's what works for the kids. It's what works for the family.
3317520	3323680	Did you read the Men Are Lost Can We Find a Way Out of the Wilderness article by Christine Ember,
3323680	3328640	who's in the Washington Post a couple of months ago. Was Washington Post? It's in the something.
3328720	3333440	Anyway, she had this beautiful conception in it that said many young men feel that
3333440	3338720	difficulties are often dismissed out of hand as whining from a patriarchy that they don't feel a
3338720	3345040	part of. It seems like a lot of modern men are being made to pay for the sins and advantages
3345040	3349360	of their fathers and grandfathers. And I thought that that was very interesting that
3351280	3354640	kind of like in comedy, right? You're allowed to punch up, but you can't punch down.
3355120	3360320	And because men have had it good for so long, you have this concern in giving them any sympathy.
3360320	3367840	And even though largely pick most of the extreme negative outcomes that you want in life,
3367840	3372240	apart from sexual assault, and you're going to find a man on the receiving end,
3372240	3377040	whether it's homelessness, drug addiction, violent crime, mental health, being in jail,
3377120	3386320	suicide, like all of it. And there was this video of a, I think it was a trans man,
3386880	3394080	so a woman who became a man or looked like a man or whatever, who was absolutely horrified
3394720	3398560	by the lack of attention. Oh, people cross the street when they were walking.
3398560	3403120	It wasn't even just that. It's just like people ignore you. When you're a woman, you get attention.
3403120	3408480	And people just ignore a guy most of the time for most intense and purposes.
3408480	3413040	But those are, in my opinion, in erratical differences between the sexes,
3413040	3418000	the way our biological roles are, when women are going to get more attention.
3418000	3422880	I think you can definitely see, listening to your, pull yourself up by your bootstraps kind
3422880	3428160	of mentality, especially when it comes to men. You can definitely see that sort of Soviet,
3428240	3433200	like man be hard, man lift thing, man protect woman. That was actually money and a throw,
3433200	3439760	but that's the best rush you can get now. Yeah, I think that you can see that. And this is why
3440480	3444560	there's a multiplicity of opinions about how to do this. And I think it's why it's interesting
3444560	3449520	that everybody can contribute in it. Give me a critique of what I'm saying. I'd love to explore
3449520	3454160	that with you. There's nothing that I would disagree with massively. I think that it's
3454160	3458560	important to recognize the structural disadvantages faced by men and boys at the moment, going from
3458560	3463440	a brawn based to a brain based economy, when you have a disposition to be less conscientious,
3463440	3468720	where you are put into an education system that doesn't suit the disposition of boys,
3468720	3476720	but you're graded in the same manner as an entire sex who does boys are naturally going to fall
3476720	3481360	behind. And I think that you're seeing the outcomes of this in the way that schooling
3482320	3489520	and between the ages 21 and 29 women earn a grand and a bit more than men do. The gender pay gap
3489520	3495360	isn't a gender pay gap, it's a mother pay gap. That's the penalization comes to mothers.
3495360	3499520	I don't disagree with any of that, but the question is what's the answer? What's the solution to that?
3499520	3505360	I think that creating a positive view for masculinity, creating, and this is again why
3505360	3510400	Peterson and Andrew Tate as well have been so successful because they said, you can be something.
3510880	3515680	You can actually step out there and wrangle the world and I believe in you and I'm proud of you
3515680	3521760	and it's not wrong for you to try and want to get mastery or conquer something or achieve something,
3521760	3526160	have ambition, to be able to make decisions easily and stand up well under pressure like,
3526160	3529200	you know, these are all fucking good things that are not only good for you, but they're good for
3529200	3533040	the world as well. I think that there needs to be a positive vision, that would be one.
3533760	3538080	I think that that creates a positive feedback loop for men. I do think that there's some manning
3538080	3546480	up in the most transcendent and include like Wilburian way that we can, but I also think that,
3546480	3549760	you know, we need to look at structural initiatives that can help boys and men
3550320	3557040	because there's no other group on the planet who, when they fall behind, are pointed out and said,
3557040	3561040	this is your problem, you need to sort it out. Every other group, we would spend billions in
3561040	3565680	taxpayer-funded money to create committees and charities and initiatives that actually work
3565680	3570720	out what's going on and help them boots on the ground to be able to do this. I don't think,
3571840	3576240	like, if a man has a problem or if a woman has a problem, we say, what can we do to fix society?
3576240	3580800	If a man has a problem, we say, what can a man do to fix himself? Now, maybe that's the fundamental
3580800	3587120	asymmetry at the heart of the sex difference, but in a society that has surplus resources
3587120	3594640	that can help, I don't see why we wouldn't afford the, why we would make men unnecessarily swim upstream,
3594640	3604240	if that makes sense. It does make sense. However, I think that my view is what you said earlier,
3604240	3612240	it's the fundamental asymmetry between the sexes. Now, it's true that all groups face various
3612240	3618800	structural inequalities. For example, I'm 5'9", barely. And do you play basketball? Not very
3618880	3624240	well, I should say, for that reason alone. Actually, if you look at the evidence,
3624240	3631680	heitism is one of the biggest openly available forms of discrimination that isn't condemned
3631680	3637840	or dealt with in any way. And one of your team is Scouse, so that must be...
3637840	3640000	He's even shorter than me, believe it or not. It must be awful.
3640000	3647840	Yeah. So, what's the answer to that? My answer to that has not been to get leg extensions,
3649040	3652880	or to complain about structural heitism. Do you know that like...
3652880	3654240	Structural heitism.
3655200	3658640	You joke, but if you want to play this fucking game, this is my point.
3658640	3662720	I'm not laughing at that, I'm just... Structural heitism is a term that I haven't heard before.
3662720	3667920	So, if you look at the CEOs of the top Fortune 500 companies, like 90% or something,
3668480	3673360	don't quote me on it, you can look it up. A very, very, very significant portion of them
3673360	3677520	are over six foot tall. Almost always the taller president wins, I think as well.
3677520	3681360	Right. Now, is the answer to that, not in Russia, by the way.
3684160	3688880	In Russia, you don't need that. So, do we complain about that?
3688880	3690880	Should we complain about that? Should I sit here and be like,
3690880	3695280	Oh, because I'm five foot nine, I don't get the... It doesn't help anything,
3695280	3700160	it doesn't change anything. And I remember it's so funny because I have a friend of mine,
3700160	3705760	he was like a Green Party voter, the most woke person that you could possibly imagine.
3705840	3710400	And he is like five five. And I made this point to him, I said,
3710400	3715200	yeah, but you talk about only structural issues with this group and that group and whatever,
3715200	3718640	and you're five five, did you know about heitism or whatever? And he was like,
3718640	3726080	yeah, but being five five has just made me who I am. I was like, yes, yes, you are what you are.
3726080	3731280	The world isn't going to change to you. My favorite scene in Game of Thrones,
3731280	3735680	have you seen Game of Thrones? Is Tyrion, when he's talking to Jon Snow and he calls him a
3735680	3740320	bastard and Jon Snow takes offense and he goes, have I offended you bastard? He goes,
3740320	3747680	let me give you some advice, bastard, never forget what you are. The world won't wear it like armor
3747680	3752960	and it can never be used to hurt you. That's the answer to all of this, right? And you're right
3752960	3756640	about Peterson and Tay who I think are very different figures, but nonetheless, their success
3756640	3760800	is based on the fact that they're telling men what men do need to hear in that respect, which is,
3760800	3766320	it's okay to be a man. It's okay to have drive. It's okay to have ambition. It's okay to have
3766320	3771680	aggression. It's okay to want things. It's okay to want status. It's okay to want money. It's okay
3771680	3776720	to want power. These are all things that are okay. They have pathological side effects when
3776720	3781600	not handled properly, but the drive to achieve, the drive to succeed, the drive to dominate,
3781600	3787120	the drive to win, these are good things and pursue them. And by the way, here's the interesting
3787120	3794240	bit. Those woke women, they love that shit. This is what I'm going to teach my son, right?
3794240	3798240	Whatever the society tells you about how it's wrong to be a man, at the end of the day, they're
3798240	3803920	all going to reward you for being a real man. This is the best time in some ways to be a real man
3803920	3810000	because you clean up. The competition is outing itself, is taking itself out of the picture.
3810000	3814640	If you act like a man, you clean up. That's the position we're in.
3814640	3820720	Well, there's a number of left-leaning women who are lamenting the fact that they can't find
3821520	3829760	a man who meets both their political preference and also will woo them appropriately on the date,
3829760	3834400	right? It's like, why are all of the men who do the things that I want from the other political
3834400	3840160	party? I think it's like 30% or 40% of Democrats and Republicans fear that their son or daughter will
3840160	3844720	marry somebody of the opposite political belief. This tribalism that we spoke about earlier on.
3844720	3848480	Speaking about toxic masculinity, as part of that debate, I did a little bit of preparation
3848480	3853440	and I found some of my favorite headlines of things that are toxic masculinity.
3854080	3860080	Mass shootings, gang violence, climate change, the financial crisis is toxic masculinity, Brexit,
3860080	3865040	the election of Donald Trump, not wearing a mask, eating meat, physical fitness, fast food,
3865040	3870560	capitalism is toxic masculinity and communism is toxic masculinity, hip hop, smelling of
3870560	3875520	ax body spray, which is links for the British people, being stoic, risk-taking, religion,
3875520	3882080	but also secularism and atheism, playing board games, being interested in cars and saying hello
3882080	3887600	or have a nice day, all toxic masculinity. I'm saying hello is fucking atrocious, mate.
3889920	3893600	Yeah, that's sort of, I think that's part of the male gaze. There was this,
3894480	3897840	I think it was a rule, was it not put on the London Underground for a while that
3897840	3902720	like the men's wandering eyes or something, that was a concern. But here's another thing,
3902720	3905600	right? I'd be interested to get your take on this. I brought this up with that same
3906880	3911200	fitness influencer a couple of weeks ago, Sarah, really good response as well.
3914560	3922960	Internet incidents, big ones. People in the real world use the response of the Internet.
3922960	3927520	They crowdsource their sense-making to how other people responded. So you'll have seen
3927520	3931280	these Jim TikToks of girls videoing themselves, working out, and sometimes there's a guy in
3931280	3935200	the background. And if the guy looks over a bit much, because for whatever reason, he's looking at
3935200	3938880	her, he's looking at the camera, he's looking at himself, he's doing whatever. Sometimes they make
3938880	3944560	a big song and dance about it. The first big one of those that happened, it could have gone either
3944560	3947760	way. You could have tossed a coin and I would have said, I don't know. The Internet may say that
3947760	3953360	this is reprehensible. I thought it was fine, but I could have seen the Internet going on the
3953360	3957520	other side of the fence and saying, sure, find this guy, dox him, shoot him, blah, blah, blah.
3959840	3968240	It didn't. And that now has created a new bar of behavior, expected behavior, both for men and
3968240	3974400	for women. The interesting thing that it made me realize is the women who saw that TikTok,
3974400	3978720	had it have gone the other way and had it have been completely reprehensible and totally not
3978720	3988720	allowed, would then have reset their worldview expectation way more sensitive. Their radar is
3988720	3993600	now looking for, did that guy glance over three times or more in the space of 90 seconds? If so,
3993600	4000960	this equals a dangerous situation, because the Internet told me so. And it's a very sort of
4001040	4006880	slippery slope in one direction only. It only moves towards more sensitivity, not more robustness,
4006880	4010800	right? I thought that was interesting. Perception is projection.
4011600	4019120	What's that mean? It means that you see what you expect to see. You perceive your own projections
4019120	4025760	of the world. You had that fucking hyper viral moment about the scar makeup. Tell it again for
4025760	4030000	the people that don't know. So they did an experiment where they told a group of women that
4030000	4035040	they're going to put scarring on their faces or visual disfigurements of some kind. And then they
4035040	4040720	would go into an interview. And the purpose of the experiment is to work out whether the interviewer
4040720	4046240	is going to treat them differently because of their facial disfigurement. What they didn't tell the
4046240	4050640	women is as they were leaving to go for the interview, they touched up their makeup and
4050640	4056800	without showing them the facial disfigurement removed the scarring. So they went into the
4056800	4062400	interview thinking they're facially scarred, but they weren't. And they came back reporting massive
4062400	4067680	levels of discrimination, specific comments that the interviewer had made about them that they
4067680	4074320	perceived. So you see what you expect to see. This is why teaching people victimhood is so
4074320	4079440	dangerous because it makes them victims. It makes them expect certain things and then they will
4079440	4083680	react differently. I mean, you know, police interactions are a good example of this. If
4083680	4088000	you expect the police are going to treat you badly because of who you are, you're going to act in a
4088000	4092800	different way and therefore cause more problems. And I say this to somebody, you know, I was a very
4092800	4099760	angry young man and my wife used to piss me off so much. She would constantly say, like,
4099760	4104160	I'd get into an argument with somebody and I'd be like, that guy's a prick. He did this. And she'd
4104160	4108400	be like, you are creating those situations. You know that, right? And I was like, no, you're
4108480	4112880	forever. And it took me like a good 10 years to work out. Absolutely, I was.
4112880	4119200	Absolutely, I was. Right? So we perceive the things that we put out into the world. And this is,
4119200	4123840	you know, Peterson talks about this is you can't see without hierarchy because your brain has to
4123840	4130160	know what to focus on. And what you focus on is a function of the filter that you project onto the
4130160	4134480	world. I'm focusing on you now instead of the bookshelf behind you. I could have been sitting
4134560	4140560	here picking out a good book this entire time. It's been a waste. But so that's what's happening
4140560	4144320	there. But it's interesting. I mean, I said something at the time, I was like, look, these
4144320	4149200	creepy men need to stop staring at women in gyms. Otherwise, they're going to stop wearing lingerie
4149200	4155600	to go there and then everybody loses. And what I'm trying to make is that like, you know,
4157040	4160160	this is a very, I'm going to say something very controversial here, Chris, you ready?
4161040	4162400	Men are attracted to women.
4164800	4168720	I've heard about that. Let's sit with that for a moment. I've heard about that. So, you know,
4168720	4176240	this idea that you're going to be barely clad, and men aren't going to notice that.
4177360	4183200	Sorry, that's not what our brains are for. Our brains are for looking at your ass. That's what
4183200	4188400	they're for. That's what they evolved for. I know it's crudely put. I learned the term for this new
4188400	4194400	style of gym short. It's got what's called a butt scrunch. Right. Have you seen the butt scrunch?
4194400	4198720	Yes. Right. Yeah, you're a married man. Online. Of course. Yeah, someone showed me a photo. I
4198720	4204240	tried to look away. Yeah, which is for the people that haven't seen it and aren't training in gyms
4204240	4209840	with like 20 year olds in, it's like a normal pair of shorts, training shorts for a girl,
4209840	4215600	like kind of tight. But then it's got kind of like a thong bit that separates the ass cheeks out,
4216320	4222320	which has been normalized very quick. Do you remember the first time that wearing just leggings
4222960	4228960	became a thing? Because I do. Because it wasn't when I went to uni. So it was after 2006. It was
4228960	4234400	after, maybe it happened while I was at uni. So maybe before 2010. But I remember thinking, wow,
4234400	4240400	that's like, that's like everything on display. That's kind of like, kind of like no pants.
4241040	4244560	But then also kind of not. And then now it's like, oh, that's kind of like
4245280	4250880	no pants. Well, like that's kind of like just a thong, but blue or like purple or lilac.
4250880	4254880	I feel you've dedicated a lot of time to describing this accurately, which I appreciate.
4254880	4259520	I mean, casual ornithologist on the side. I wanted to tell you about this.
4259520	4266240	Can I say some just on that before you move on? Because I think we sort of like,
4266720	4272560	we're trying to pretend things all the time, which, yes, men shouldn't be pigs.
4273360	4278720	We can all agree on that. But in order to not be a pig, I first have to see your ass that you've
4278720	4286480	shoved in my face. So I see it. I am then after that, not a pig. But I see it. And it's there.
4286480	4292960	And my brain isn't calibrated or designed or evolved. I mean, the sole purpose of our genes
4292960	4297440	is to reproduce, right? How is that just what I'm saying? Well, there's a female frame that's
4297440	4304800	placed around this conversation specifically that I don't think fully, maybe goes far as to say,
4304800	4313680	like sympathizes with the male brain reward system. There is an inbuilt reward system that men have
4313680	4320400	for looking at sexually gratifying objects, even things like two rocks that look a bit like boobs.
4321200	4323840	Right? What's the first thing a boy does when he gets a calculator?
4324800	4330480	Right boobs. Yep. Now, is that because of toxic masculinity or is that because
4330480	4336880	men evolved for millions of years throughout evolutionary history, including pre-human animals,
4337760	4342720	to seek the opposite sex and the drive in males is just overwhelmingly strong? Now,
4342800	4350160	once you have noticed that, how you act is where culture and society and civilizing men
4350160	4355600	comes in, right? Just because you saw someone's ass doesn't mean that you're allowed to go and
4355600	4363360	stare at it or grab it or whatever. But you saw it. And you're not... It's almost like it happens.
4363360	4368480	And then you're like, okay, I need to... Fuck, yeah. Yeah. That's how it works. Now, what do
4368480	4374160	you want me to do about that? What are you supposed to do about that? I'm open to suggestions.
4375040	4381360	Blinkers. Blinker men. Big... Some people would be in favor of that. The big veil that goes over the
4381360	4386000	top. Right. A little bit of inside baseball for people who aren't familiar with what's going on
4386000	4390640	in the podcasting world. And apparently this one's slipped by you as well. Theo Von and other
4390640	4396640	significant podcasters allegedly defrauded of approximately $4 million and then calls out
4396640	4402400	the fraudster in a video. In an unexpected turn of events, Colin Thompson, the man who was working
4402400	4407840	under cast media and with Theo Von, is accused of orchestrating a fraud operation that cost Theo Von's
4407840	4413840	podcast this past weekend and potentially other podcasts an estimated $4 million. Theo Von and
4413840	4418800	his crew detected inconsistencies in their payments, which is when trouble started, advertisers
4418800	4423360	allegedly paid Colin Thompson and cast media directly, leaving Theo with less money than
4423360	4429680	anticipated. And I know, from my side of the fence, that there are quite a few other podcasts
4429680	4435840	that were with this particular company. And it seems like this gentleman has been living a good
4435840	4442080	life. Meanwhile, he's been robbing Peter to pay Paul to keep on cycling this through photos of
4442080	4448720	Lamborghinis and nice houses allegedly. And people aren't happy. And then Theo did a 10 minute video
4449520	4457520	that said, sorry, brother, you messed with the wrong rat. And this video, I think within 24 hours,
4457520	4464720	it hit a mill, plays photos of the guy, all the rest of it. So ructions, ructions in the podcasting
4464720	4473440	world. I can't wait to be able to be defrauded of $4 million. That's my dream goal to get to that
4473440	4480640	position. Yeah, you got to be careful, man. You got to be careful. That's why what we're building
4480640	4484400	trigonometry and we've got some big plans beyond just trigonometry itself is
4485840	4490000	bringing cool people together, but doing it under our own steam, under our own umbrella,
4490000	4495360	having everything managed by us with the right values and the right team. It's really important.
4496000	4501360	For the people that don't know how podcast advertising works, I handle almost all of my
4502240	4507040	big partners as well, directly. But a lot of the time, there'll be an agency that sits in between
4507040	4511600	you and them invoicing is kind of hard. Oh, there's an IO and did the deliverables get done and how
4511600	4515920	many numbers did that podcast hit and so on and so forth. And also, who's advertising at the moment?
4515920	4520320	Oh, there's a new company in town, maybe we can increase the costs or the price that we're charging
4520320	4523840	for this all that like it's messy and it's back and forth and whatever, whatever, especially if
4523840	4528560	you're doing lots of little deals as opposed to how I have it, which is a small number of larger
4528560	4533440	partners. And yeah, you have these guys that sit in between you and them classic agency model,
4533440	4536480	it's like a modeling agency, right? Like you have a model, there's your talent, you have
4536480	4541200	clients that want models and you take a bit off the top, take somewhere between 10 and 25%
4541200	4546640	depending on who the partner is and how big the deals are. But they hold the money, like they
4546640	4552640	get paid the money from the advertiser and then less they're cut, they'll pass it down to the
4552640	4558240	podcaster. These podcasts are largely run, I mean, you'll get your YouTube AdSense revenue,
4558240	4562640	which is not nothing, but fucking hell, it's not what you're making from your proper partners.
4563200	4569520	And yeah, if I don't know, man, I mean, it's such a it's obviously you can chase these people down
4569520	4572880	for like, we're going to fucking get them for fraud, but they're just going to declare bankruptcy,
4572880	4579120	you're fucking moved to the Cayman Islands or whatever. So yeah, I feel this is the first
4579120	4586000	time that we've seen a big case like this, which is slap bang in the bullseye of the
4586560	4589840	of our world, right? It's the first time that this has happened. And
4591440	4595520	kind of surprising it hasn't happened before, but hopefully it's a formative experience that
4595520	4602560	that's one other thing. If you want to fuck some people over for $4 million, don't fuck people over
4602560	4606400	that have a combined reach of 20 million YouTube subscribers, you know what I mean?
4607840	4613440	Absolutely. No, it's not a smart move. But look, I think we're sort of living through a wild,
4613440	4618480	wild west of the internet. I mean, actually, the wild, wild west of the internet is over,
4618480	4622720	but the podcasting world, it's very new. So there's going to be a lot of this shit going on. I
4622720	4627920	imagine this isn't an isolated incident, actually. So yeah, I think we all got to be careful and
4627920	4634800	smart about how the way we build, we build things that we build. Rule Britannia. Rule Britannia.
4635840	4639520	Rule Britannia. Come on, mate, you're actually British, unlike me. I'm trying. Rule Britannia.
4640480	4643760	At last night of the proms, hijacked by activists waving EU flags.
4644880	4648960	The site of hundreds of European Union flags. The last night of the proms have prompted an
4648960	4654000	outrage from Brexiteers and a call for the BBC to investigate those waving the EU flag.
4654000	4658560	And the Royal Albert Hall appeared to outnumber those waving the Union flag at the event,
4658560	4663040	which is usually a patriotic display following a campaign by pro Europeans. The spectacle of
4663040	4669040	so many EU flags being waved as the whole belted out rule Britannia provoked disgust
4669040	4676560	from leading Eurosceptics. What's going on? That's from the Guardian.
4676560	4684160	I voted to remain in the referendum and I've largely, I don't know if I've changed my view
4684160	4689120	of that, how I would vote, but my view of that issue has evolved so much precisely by seeing
4689120	4695280	these fucking morons who just completely are incapable of understanding what democracy means.
4695280	4702160	Democracy means that when you lose, you accept it. There's some other parallels for that particular
4702160	4710320	statement. When you lose, you accept it. And we've had for the last seven years, these just
4710320	4717200	absolute fucking lunatics running around acting like what democracy means as they always get their
4717280	4726560	way. And they have to insert this into everything. They've just become obsessed. And it's mind boggling
4726560	4732400	to me. How we're still talking about Brexit is mind boggling to me. I don't get it.
4732400	4737440	Yeah, that's insane. It's insane. That's like a Eons old talking point now.
4737440	4742000	I think if you are still talking about Brexit, your brain is broken.
4742000	4745200	When do you think that rule gets applied to COVID?
4749680	4756480	I think that with COVID, I actually said this before COVID was over and in this instance,
4756480	4759840	I get things wrong all the time, but this was something that turned out to be right,
4760400	4766000	that people will want to forget very quickly. And they have done. Even I want to move on from
4766000	4769920	COVID. We talked about it earlier, but I don't have any great desire to talk about it. Most
4769920	4776800	people have moved on without learning the lessons of the thing. So I think the reason to still talk
4776800	4783520	about COVID is that there is a future pandemic coming and we ought to learn the lessons of this
4783520	4790880	one while we still can. With Brexit, it's a political decision that is not reversible unless
4790880	4795280	you have another referendum, which in which case you're free to campaign to have another referendum
4795280	4800720	if that's what you'd like. I'm not sure showing up with EU flags at the proms is the way to achieve
4800720	4804720	a second referendum. I'm not a political expert, but that's my type.
4804720	4811520	Yeah. There is a resurgence of activism occurring at the moment, but it's always in criticism of
4811520	4818000	stuff. So George Mack, one of my friends, highlighted that the last time that there was a
4818000	4823840	ticker tape parade for someone that wasn't healthcare professionals in America for
4823920	4833360	something, not against something, was Nelson Mandela in the 90s. So you have a culture of
4833360	4842720	activism and of public displays of passion, however, can only be against something,
4843280	4845520	while people are only choosing to do it against something.
4845680	4855120	And people respond to incentives. What's that saying? Ever a great cause begins as a movement,
4855120	4857840	becomes a business, and eventually it degenerates into a racket.
4858800	4864320	And there are many people in this country who made a career out of being prominent
4864320	4871840	remainers. And when Brexit was over, what are you going to do? So they just carry on.
4872560	4877680	And the people, they feed this crap like having this crap fed to them. So they just,
4877680	4885120	they keep going. It's a reward incentive-based system because it's a pointless conversation.
4885120	4890640	You're not going to change the result of the referendum. Even if you succeeded in proving
4890640	4896240	that Brexit was a bad idea, it's already happened. So you can argue for a second referendum or
4896240	4901520	another referendum if you want. But that's it, right? But talking about how shit Brexit is,
4901520	4907760	isn't about achieving a result beyond your own personal enrichment satisfaction status, etc.
4907760	4913600	And Femi, this Marina Perkus woman, there's a shit ton of these people on Twitter whose only
4913600	4917920	thing that they do is talk about Brexit and get thousands and thousands of views.
4917920	4925200	Yeah, it makes me sad to think about people who, I know there's one incident that occurs,
4925200	4931840	especially like public stuff, like some catastrophe or news stuff, like people that
4931840	4936560	are still talking about Madeleine McCann. Do you know what I mean? Like I understand
4936560	4940000	fucking terrible situation, but there are people whose entire lives I want-
4940000	4941040	I mean, they are her parents.
4944400	4946000	I once stepped into-
4956160	4957840	Fuck's sake, Constantine.
4960160	4962720	He was there. You left an open goal out to me.
4962720	4970960	Yeah, you can take the comedian out of comedy. I once descended. I got hit with the fucking
4970960	4976160	like blast radius of these two investigative journalists. I had them on the show when
4976160	4979840	the disappearance of Madeleine McCann came out on Netflix. And these were the two main people,
4979840	4982160	her husband and wife. And I brought them on. I thought,
4982160	4985040	fucking hell, like these are the two, these are the fucking experts. These are the guys that
4985040	4987840	Netflix went to. They must be like fucking legit, you know what I mean?
4989600	4995920	Brought them on. Turns out there is an ardent fucking group of people who really do not like
4995920	5000880	them on the internet. And I was a part of like Madeleine McCann law for a couple of weeks,
5001440	5005520	because this guy has platformed these people that we know they're a part of the,
5005520	5009520	like whatever the fuck cover up scheme and they didn't know the thing that went on.
5009520	5013200	Do you haven't read the original police report from Portugal or wherever she was from?
5014960	5019280	And it's, there's part of me that thinks like noble cause you're chasing after it.
5019280	5024720	It's part of me that thinks, holy fuck, you've been captured by this one thing,
5024720	5029360	like this one incident has just completely controlled your life forever.
5032160	5035520	I mean, the one thing that doesn't get set off and enough is, you know,
5035520	5041440	there's a certain proportion of society that's not mentally well, massively overrepresented online,
5041440	5046720	right? So I think a lot of people are just, you know, it's, it's, it's an obsession of theirs or
5046720	5051680	whatever. You don't get to see what's driving. This is what I often think when I'm reading
5051680	5056800	Twitter replies, because I'm like, well, these people are like, you know, normal and right,
5056800	5060960	and most of them are, of course they are, but like you read something weird and then I sort of like
5060960	5065920	go, okay, let's imagine what sort of circumstances I would have to be sitting in to write this.
5066480	5069920	And then I see that picture and I go, okay, this makes sense. You know what I mean?
5069920	5076080	Like when I see people saying really crazy shit, I'm like, so this, I just think what we forget
5076080	5081200	sometimes is a lot of people are, you know, in that situation. I was telling you about this
5081200	5086160	preventative medicine place that I've been to in America. So it's called Fountain Life.
5086720	5092560	And I did a podcast with the founder forever ago and thought, that sounds fucking cool. Didn't
5092560	5096160	really know what preventative medicine was, although it's kind of encapsulated in the name.
5096160	5102720	And I ended up getting like everything done. Full body MRI, CT scan, heart angiogram, brain
5102720	5107920	angiogram. I need to do that, man. Full works. Yes. I will 100% link you with them. One of the
5107920	5115280	things they do, I think it's called contrast. So you're hooked up to an IV, which is like a
5115280	5120800	mechanical IV. So when they press a button, just shit goes into you. So they've got you in the
5120800	5125760	fucking cannula or whatever it is, they've got the thing in there. And then there's this huge,
5125760	5131840	big wheel spinning around you unbelievably quickly. So you're kind of an MRI machine,
5131840	5136240	it's a little bit more open and this huge fuck off wheel that's obviously like scanning shit.
5136800	5144560	And then this, they pump stuff from this machine into your vein. And it lights up your heart
5145120	5151440	it goes into the ventricles of the heart while this thing's in a very specific position
5151440	5157760	over you and blah, blah, blah. But the felt sense of it is heat starting in your neck
5158320	5162640	and going only through your torso doesn't touch any of your limbs going only through your torso
5162640	5168800	and finishing in like your bladder. And then it cools off around your bladder for about 20 seconds.
5168880	5175200	It is one of the strangest fucking experiences. It's not unpleasant, strange. I would definitely
5175200	5179200	wouldn't even say it's that unpleasant, to be honest. It's like, must be what feeling like a
5179200	5184880	dragon is like, just fucking heat moving around inside of you. So yeah, that was very interesting.
5184880	5187680	I can't wait. Preventative medicine though, we were saying it before.
5190320	5194240	Playing a game where you try to catch up to a disease that's already happened
5195200	5202720	by design is a losing fight, right? Absolutely. No, I think that seems to me to be the future
5202720	5208160	of the direction that we're going is like looking into genetic predispositions. I know people who
5208160	5213680	are having procedures because they know they have a certain risk, etc. Chris Hemsworth found out on
5213680	5219440	that discovery documentary that he's got, I think he's got genetic predisposition to alximers.
5219440	5224560	So he's spending way more time with his family and he's doing other things. He adjusted his entire
5224560	5228880	life because I might not be able to remember this. Should learn a second language. That's protective
5228880	5232720	against alximers? People who speak multiple languages are much less likely to have it.
5235120	5241360	I wonder... Which way the causal effect works, I don't know. But I imagine exercising your brain
5241360	5244560	in multiple ways is helpful to protecting yourself against things like that.
5245280	5254080	Yeah, I don't know, man. There's a multiplicity of ideas about how we're supposed to live our lives.
5254800	5261360	And in some regards, it's amazing. The promise of free access to information 24 hours a day,
5261360	5267280	all of human civilization's knowledge at your fingertips, that combined with the falling
5267280	5273920	away of the gatekeepers and this loss of trust in institutions actually makes for really fucking
5274800	5281520	disquieting journey for a lot of people. Because who do I trust? Do your own research?
5282560	5286800	Fuck, I've got a life to live. I've got to try and... To the family and the kids and the house
5286800	5293280	and the dog and the me and you want me to... I've got to go and do my own... Give me the medical
5293280	5296960	journal. I'm going to go through this, whether it's about health. Are carbs good? Is sugar good?
5296960	5300320	What about... Should we be eating more butter? What about meat? Is meat killing me or should I go
5300320	5306560	vegan? What about paleo? Libert King says I need more testicle and it's everything.
5307760	5313760	I'll see you and I'll raise you, which is what if the way for you to live your life that's optimal
5313760	5320560	is different to mine? My wife's very into Ayurvedic medicine and that's the entire concept of it,
5320560	5326000	is the different types of people that need different food, different times that they eat,
5326560	5335440	all sorts of different things. A lot of it is experiential. When I found out that you could
5335440	5342000	just eat protein and greens, I was like, whoa, this is amazing and that's what I do. I have carbs
5342000	5347360	every now and again, but it fits how I am wired and my wife's the exact opposite.
5347920	5355440	She's water, wind, you're fire. Fire is the lead for me.
5355520	5359440	Anton. Anton's wind. Francis. Water.
5359440	5365200	Knew it. Bloody water. It's pretty obvious. Bloody water. Water is great if you can get it off the
5365200	5370880	sofa. Then it's like a bowl rolling down the hill. You can't stop it. It becomes unstoppable,
5370880	5374960	but it's a fucking hard... It takes a lot of fire to get water off the sofa.
5375680	5380960	Yeah, I was fascinated. He taught me about this in Austin when we were hanging last time. I thought
5380960	5388080	it was really fascinating. He taught me as well, ambient water, ambient, not refrigerated water,
5388080	5396000	should avoid drinking cold water too much. Yeah. That's their way. That's how they see it. I'm
5396000	5400000	by no means an expert, but generally, ingesting cold things is not good for you.
5401440	5405280	Yogurt. I love yogurts so much, though. Dairy also not great, as I understand it.
5405280	5409920	I mean, look, I'm not supposed to eat red meat and I mostly red meat, so you break the rules
5409920	5415200	sometimes. Yeah. But no, I understand what you mean, that different strokes for different folks.
5415200	5419120	But fucking hell, even if there can be different strokes for different folks,
5419120	5424160	I should be able to find a source that can... I'm this kind of a person, therefore, I can do this
5424160	5434800	kind of a thing. This is where the... If I was more conspiratorial, I would say that the goal of a
5434800	5441840	messy information landscape is not to convince you of any one narrative, but to convince you that
5441840	5450880	no narrative can be trusted. And it seems to me that if I was maybe even in a various domestic
5450880	5459520	actor wanting to make a sort of nihilistic, fatalistic, placid, not compliant, but just like
5460480	5466960	surrendered populace. Well, you know the rat electrification experiment, right? Where they
5466960	5473600	put a rat in a cell where the floor gives them an electric shock. And what they found was,
5475440	5479120	in psychology, this is called... What's the term? Learned helplessness? Yes. This is the
5479120	5486880	Learned Helplessness Experiment, where if the rat is able to end the electric shock by pressing a
5486880	5493360	button, then the rat will continue to do that. If the rat has no control over the electric shock,
5493360	5499200	it will just lie down and take it, right? So I think this... What you're talking about is a system
5499200	5504720	that creates learned helplessness in people, which is one of the reasons... While, of course,
5504720	5509040	it's super tempting to bash the mainstream media and they deserve a lot of the bashing,
5509040	5515120	we need a media ecosystem that's trusted. We do need politicians who can be trusted.
5515680	5521760	I'm not happy with the status quo that we've got the moment where we trust no one and with good
5521760	5526880	reason. But the solution to that isn't to trust the mainstream. The solution is for the mainstream
5526880	5531520	to become trustworthy. Yeah. Do you think that's even possible? I think it's very difficult in the
5531520	5537120	modern environment. It's very, very difficult because I just see that us, we're running a small
5537120	5542560	media organization, just you are too, right? It's like, do you get everything right? Is your
5542560	5547840	research always on point? So it's very, very difficult. Interesting what you said earlier about
5550400	5554400	there are certain things that they're able to do that we're not, like fact-checking and stuff.
5554400	5559040	They're also, because of how they're incentivized and subsidized and the expectations,
5559760	5568880	like non-sexy stories, digging into weather and accounts and stuff, tell me which
5569840	5576080	YouTube channel is going to predict tomorrow's weather. No one, right? Not sexy enough. Too much
5576080	5582240	of a cost to be able to do. And no one's saying the fucking Met Office, they're captured by the
5582240	5586560	woke. Although there was that thing this year, right? Where they made most of Europe look like
5586560	5590720	it had turned to ash because anything over 35 degrees Celsius meant that it was like
5591680	5596480	the blackened end of a cigarette. So maybe there is a little bit of fuckery going on.
5596480	5602160	Yeah. Well, there is a lot of fuckery going on. What's interesting is I find the climate issue
5602160	5608880	absolutely fascinating. It's genuinely fascinating to me because the historical ignorance on that
5608880	5614320	issue that is being deliberately spread is like mind-blowing to me. Do you know the Romans when
5614320	5622160	they occupied Britain? They grew grapes on Hadron's Wall. Hadron's Wall for people listening used to
5622320	5629760	protect England from what is now England from what is now Scotland, right? One of the
5629760	5633920	northernmost points on the British Isles. Now, if you don't know Scotland,
5634480	5638160	fucking cold. It's average weather in, I used to live in Edinburgh for seven years,
5638160	5643440	average weather in Scotland in August is like 18 degrees and rain at best, right? So
5643440	5654240	what we are being told about that issue is absolutely mind-blowingly, incredibly
5654240	5658880	unhelpful and inaccurate. Wasn't there, I think it's still around somewhere in London
5658880	5663600	or somewhere in the South Coast, 40 miles inland from the coast, there's ports.
5663600	5668880	Pevensey Castle. Yeah. Pevensey Castle, you go there and they're like, yeah, the sea used to be here.
5669840	5677200	I don't see this. 2000 years ago. Yeah. So this whole conversation is very, very odd to me and
5678080	5682880	after my Oxford speech went viral, I had a lot of invitations to go and speak to different people
5682880	5687440	and I was talking to this guy who works for the Indian government at a high level and he told me
5687440	5694960	when India became independent in 1947, average life expectancy was 37 years old in India and
5694960	5701920	today it's I think 82 and that's because they burn fossil fuels. Now, are we saying to a billion
5701920	5706800	plus Indian people they're not allowed to do that anymore? Do you know what I mean? Like the way we
5706800	5713120	talk about this issue, just it's a cult. It doesn't make any sense. It doesn't make any logical sense.
5713120	5716880	The things that are being suggested that we do don't make any sense. The way we're approaching,
5716880	5722080	it doesn't make any sense. It's incredible to me the way this conversation is being had
5722080	5727280	and I'd love to understand, you know, Eric, who you just had on, he always says this, like
5727280	5732480	we're lying about the climate for the wrong reasons. Do you know what I mean? Like his
5732480	5737520	point is climate change is happening and it's a serious issue, but we're lying about the way
5737520	5744800	to deal with it and lots of other things around it. That's one of the most weird things to me about
5744800	5751360	what's happening. Like Bjorn Lomborg during that, oh my God, heat wave, we're all going to die,
5751600	5755760	posting stuff about, you know, like actually the number of forest fires is the lowest it's ever
5755760	5762160	been and the number of hurricanes in America, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And I would love
5762160	5766400	to know what's going on with that shit. I would love to know. Do you need theories?
5770320	5773680	Well, one thing that's interested me a lot is obviously people are familiar with the concept
5773680	5780800	of group think, but there's another thing which is the Abilene paradox. I don't know if you're
5780800	5786560	familiar with it. It's basically the idea that people will often do things because they think
5786560	5792320	other people want them done. And you combine that with mass panic, indoctrinating kids into being
5792320	5799200	terrified, et cetera. And I also think human beings love a doomsday narrative. And a portion of the
5799200	5803120	sort of side that I've been arguing on, which is this anti-work side, is like the barbarians at
5803120	5808000	the gates. Now, I genuinely think that's true. I think we are undermining the founding pillars
5808000	5813840	of our civilization, but there is an appeal to that worldview. And if you look back, neither of us
5813840	5818800	are old enough, but in the 1970s, the planet was cooling and everybody was terrified of global
5818800	5824480	cooling. Terrified. Terrified of the population bomb. Absolutely. Now we're terrified of the
5824480	5829360	depopulation. It's what we love. We love to think. And I think there's a kind of like,
5829360	5834400	we live in special times. Oh, like a mass solipsism. Yeah. Yeah. Like, look, look,
5834640	5838720	last 2000 years, shit has happened and you had Jesus in World War II and whatever,
5838720	5843520	but now is the real time when shit is happening. And he knows, maybe it is happening.
5844400	5848960	Not on this issue, I don't think. But yeah, the idea that we are living through a climate catastrophe
5848960	5854160	seems highly suspect to me. Highly suspect. But also somehow very sexy. Very sexy. Now,
5854160	5857840	that's not to say the climate isn't changing. The climate is changing. But the question I think
5857840	5863360	we also ought to be asking is, is the climate changing a bad thing? Well, climate-related
5863360	5868320	deaths have decreased by 50 times over the last 100 years. That's Alex Epstein's he
5868320	5872640	been under. Yes. We haven't had him on, but yes. Oh, dude, you guys will fucking love him, right?
5872640	5880560	I'm sure. He's an interesting dude. Climate-related deaths have decreased by 50 times. More people
5880560	5885200	are killed by cold weather than hot weather. Yes. Way, way, way more. And we know that because
5885200	5890240	this is the thing about the idea of pursuing net zero is it makes energy more expensive.
5890240	5896880	That's the method by which you achieve this to some extent. And pensioners freeze to death
5896880	5901280	every winter in this country. Now, that doesn't seem like a good thing to me. I don't think
5901920	5906800	making energy more expensive for poor elderly people and them freezing to death on their own
5906800	5911280	in their homes in the winter, I don't think that's what, I don't think if we were setting out to
5911280	5915600	improve the world, that would be one of the ways that we'd do that. But because we're trade-off
5915600	5920160	denialists because we refuse to understand that actions have consequences good and bad,
5921280	5929680	we ignore that. And this hysteria, it's cut like and I find it very strange. I find it very strange.
5929680	5934480	Whatever you think about the climate issue in and of itself, our response to it is strange.
5934480	5940560	People are just looking for a cause, right? Yeah. And this is why COVID was so captivating
5940560	5947360	on both sides because it gave us a righteous war to wage. And again, when you've got a
5947360	5952160	multiplicity of ways that you can go with your life, the man box has been blown open.
5952160	5956080	Nobody says that you should be this for masculinity. Maybe I don't even need to get
5956080	5960720	into a relationship. I can just boss bitch or like incel my way through the next however many decades
5960720	5966960	of my life do all this sort of stuff. Ah, here's a single vector along which I can move. I'm no
5966960	5972480	longer in an open field. I'm on a set of railway tracks. And yeah, you know, Peterson had the
5972480	5978880	ordering chaos, like paradigm out there. It feels like there's a fucking hell of a lot of chaos and
5978880	5984160	not a massive amount of order for people. And then the people that live in chaos land and prefer
5984160	5988960	that look at the people in order land as tyrants and the people in order land look at the people
5988960	5994240	in chaos land as fucking vigilantes. And yeah, it's, it doesn't surprise me, man. You know,
5994240	5999520	and this is where I said to Eric, I wish that I'd got Eric to watch the Sam episode
6000320	6003360	before he sat down with me because it was difficult for me to
6004000	6009120	portray a three hour conversation in 20 seconds. But I don't think that those guys are too far
6009120	6013360	apart. Like Eric saying we've lost faith in our institutions, but we can't get rid of them.
6014400	6021360	Independent media is both advantageous and not going away. But we fucking can't like
6021360	6026240	outsource our sense making to them as well. How do we live in this new world? What does success
6026240	6030800	look like in this regard? I thought it was fucking interesting. Look, I think we're living in a,
6030800	6035760	this is a metaphor that is overused, but it's sort of the invention of the printing press kind of
6035760	6042320	situation. I mean, that caused two centuries of religious war. So I think what the social
6042320	6047040	media in particular and the internet more broadly has done, it is as broken our ability to make
6047040	6052480	sense of the world and we are all reaching for a way to do that. I think it's going to take some
6052480	6061280	time and it's not going to be without consequence. And it's interesting because the argument about
6061280	6067600	free speech is made very complicated by the existence of social media because there are people
6067600	6072560	who say they're free speech absolutists. I've never called myself that because I don't believe
6072560	6076800	anyone is a free speech absolutist. What's your conception on free speech? Give me the
6076800	6082240	framework. Well, think about this. So Elon Musk says he's a free speech absolutist. He buys Twitter
6082240	6089280	and then the moment people trigger his personal preferences, he shuts that particular form of
6089280	6094080	conversation down when it was about children or something like that, so spreading something.
6094960	6100080	I think he said it about Alex Jones or whatever. Anyway, my point is X, Twitter, whatever has a
6100080	6108960	moderation policy because it has to because the technology is so powerful. I'll give you
6108960	6114320	both sides of the argument, right? But the argument for moderation as in content moderation
6114960	6122720	is that the technology is so powerful if you can start an assault on the Capitol or an undermining
6122720	6127600	of an election or whatever it is or a riot or a mass shooting or whatever. If you can start that
6127600	6134400	from your phone, the technology is too powerful to be left uncontrolled. I have a lot of sympathy
6134400	6140880	with that argument. However, let's flip it the other way around. You live in the United States,
6140880	6144880	now a country for which I have a tremendous regard and the history and the formation of the country
6144880	6149680	is very interesting because it creates a country that is fundamentally very different to every
6149680	6158240	other country that's existed before. Do you get 1776 if there is Twitter and it's moderated?
6159440	6165040	I don't think you do because who would allow a revolution to happen? You think King George would
6165040	6173040	allow the spreading of misinformation, right? So we are stuck in this place where on the one hand,
6173040	6177520	yes, free speech is absolute and is really super important. On the other hand, actually,
6177520	6183200	most people, it's very easy to be a free speech absolutist until you're in the hot seat making
6183200	6189280	the decision and imagine you are in the hot seat and you've got the CIA, the FBI, the heads of
6189280	6194640	government, whoever's your friends coming to you and going, if you don't do something, people are
6194640	6199600	going to get killed and they are going to get killed and that's on your conscience. It's up to you,
6199600	6206400	right? So it's a very, very difficult thing with the power of the technology that we have that has
6206400	6214400	the ability to multiply information, narratives, opinions, whatever to such an extent. So we have
6214400	6220560	not worked out how to handle that at all and everybody who says they have a solution to it,
6220560	6225280	I'd love to see them be in the hot seat for a day and then we'll see how absolutist they are about
6225280	6231040	free speech or how pro censorship they are because there's a flip side to the coin which is you do
6231040	6238000	moderation, you're going to get accused of bias from both sides, right? So I don't have no envy
6238000	6241840	for those people. Now, I do think they've made a shit ton of mistakes. I'm just saying, I suspect
6241840	6247520	I probably would have done too. Yeah, Sam had an interesting analogy where he was saying, if I
6248480	6256400	spend five years building up the waking up social media platform and I want only Nazis to be allowed
6256400	6261520	on it, I should be allowed to only have Nazis on my social media platform or the inverse. I should
6261520	6266880	be allowed to kick Nazis off. It's not my job to have people I don't want on my social media platform.
6266880	6273040	And this comes back to the pipeline versus public service argument. I mean, there's a very strong
6273040	6277360	counter argument to that argument, which is the one you've just made, which is once you've captured
6277360	6282320	the entire market, you're a monopoly and we regulate monopolies for a reason, which is
6283040	6290480	to be kicked out of the local pub does not prevent you from going and having a drink in a pub. To be
6290480	6294720	kicked off Twitter prevents you from communicating in that element of the public square.
6294720	6301360	Has there been any, there's usually concerns around monopoly. Has there been any of that
6301360	6306240	to do with online platform? Is there such a thing as too big of an online platform? Like fucking
6306960	6314000	Facebook and TikTok and YouTube have got like, you know, large portions of the planet as users.
6315520	6320240	So this is a new category in that regard. Absolutely. The banks got so big that they
6320240	6326560	needed to be split up. You take large things and make them into smaller things, right?
6326560	6330720	But you can't not with this because no one wants to be on the third best Twitter. Nobody wants to
6330720	6335280	use the third best Google, right? You do it, you split them off and then everyone just converges
6335360	6339600	back on which is the biggest one. The monopoly is what makes it valuable. The fact that it's on
6339600	6345120	there is what makes it valuable. That's why Elon Musk bought Twitter rather than building his own
6345120	6350560	from scratch. Because he has the money to build his own Twitter, but you just can't drag people over
6350560	6356400	enough. So the monopoly is the point. This is why it's such a tricky thing. The new category of
6356400	6364320	business. That's why it's the point. With sort of frictionless gravitation
6364880	6373680	toward whichever thing you want to choose to use, people will always converge on the biggest,
6373680	6380080	the best, the whatever one. Whereas, yeah, if Jim Shark gets two and a half billion
6381040	6386320	users or to customers and they say, you need to split up into Jim and Shark, right? Or Lloyds and
6386320	6392960	TSB. It's not quite the same. Not everyone's going to converge on this particular one.
6392960	6397200	It's interesting. One of the analogies I used to use from my nightclub days,
6398320	6405600	and Twitter's kind of like this. In nightlife events, it's one of the only industries where the
6405600	6412880	other users of the product are the primary value of the product itself. So if you ask one of your
6412880	6417840	friends on your 20s, mate, how was last night? And they'll say, mate, it was amazing. So many
6417840	6424160	girls in that club. No, I asked you how your night was. I didn't ask who were the other people that
6424160	6430160	went to the event. You don't say, why do I use an iPhone? I use an iPhone because David Beckham's
6430160	6434480	got an iPhone. So I use an iPhone because the camera and the apps and the battery life and
6434480	6439040	stuff like that. But nightlife was very, very interesting in that way, which is why it was
6439040	6445920	so mimetic. It's the same reason why, I'll open this up to you, internet, some industry secrets
6445920	6450880	here. Sometimes nightclubs hold cues and sometimes they make the cues thinner than they need to be.
6450880	6454640	So they look really long and then they take a photo because it looks like it was busy.
6454640	6459040	We did that. We did that all the time. We still do. It's Freshers Week next week in Newcastle.
6459040	6464400	It's exactly what every single nightclub will do. But you have that same thing with regards to
6464480	6470800	the social media as well. The other users of social media largely determine your experience on it,
6470800	6478320	which is why Rumble is this and Truth Social is whatever, right? Is there a left-leaning?
6479280	6484560	Well, they had one, Mastodon, didn't they? I don't know what happened, which tells you quite a lot.
6484560	6489120	Speaking of Mastodon, I had a guy called Ben Lam on the show. He's the CEO of this company called
6489120	6496080	Colossal. He is using ancient genetic information to bring the woolly mammoth back to life.
6496080	6502800	Within 20 years, we will have actual woolly mammoths walking on this planet. So they found,
6502800	6507200	in the Arctic, very good for preserving DNA. They found bones and all sorts of other stuff.
6508160	6514000	Mammoth carcass remains. From that, they've taken, I think it's maybe 40 or 50 different because you
6514000	6517920	don't get a full DNA sequence in any one of them. Then they've brought them all together,
6517920	6525840	used AI to fill in the little gaps. They're then going to implant a, whatever it's called stem cell,
6526880	6533200	pluripotent stem cell, inside of the Asian elephant. So an Asian elephant will give birth
6533200	6539360	to a woolly mammoth. And then after a sufficiently long amount of time, they'll get placed up north.
6539360	6544960	And they can do all sorts of awesome stuff for helping to fertilize the Arctic. And he also
6544960	6549360	wants to bring back the dodo bird. The interesting reason he wanted to bring back the dodo bird was
6550400	6556320	the reason that the dodo bird was killed off was because of unsustainable hunting practices.
6556320	6562160	So you'd think that the mammoth has a real function. The dodo bird, people laugh at it for
6562160	6566080	being this stupid pigeon that couldn't fly away. But maybe it was because of the introduction of
6566080	6571120	a particular predator or whatever. Yeah, it might have been ecological imbalance that was done by
6571120	6576560	manmade. And his point is mammoth does a thing. It's like the farmer of the Arctic.
6577440	6585280	Dodo bird is like a symbolic representation of, do you see all of the work that we had to
6585280	6590080	fucking go to, to bring this thing back to life? Be more careful when you introduce invasive species
6590080	6595440	into different ecologies. I was like, fucking hell. And he's super fired up about it. I found
6595440	6598240	him really charming. So I had a conversation with him the other day. I thought that was cool.
6598240	6601760	So they're going to bring back prehistoric animals. I think I remember seeing a movie about
6601760	6609520	that. I did say, you know, how far back can we go? Real problem, bones and teeth don't
6609520	6613840	hold much genetic information, which is a fucking massive shame. But we can do stuff like
6613840	6619440	sabertooth tigers, like particular types of sabertooth cats. I was asking him, what else
6619440	6625520	did he want to bring back? There was this huge fucking sloth, this massive thing that it was
6625520	6630160	like the largest marsupial. They live like on an island, but there were no predators.
6630160	6637360	I think so. Yeah, this gigantic fucking sloth. So there's like a laundry list of different
6637360	6643360	ridiculous megafauna prehistoric animal, prehistoric, like deceased. It's called de-extinction
6644880	6649760	extinct animals that he wants to bring back. I just thought like between that and preventative
6649760	6656640	medicine and AI. What do you thought on AI? How are you feeling? Are you fucking scared
6656640	6661760	that you're going to lose your job to GPT-6? I'm not scared I'm going to lose my job. No.
6666320	6671280	He's going to make a very significant impact on the world, but what that's going to end up looking
6671280	6677600	like, I don't think anyone really knows. I think there's probably, there's a lot of fear porn about
6677600	6681840	it and it may be justified or maybe I don't have any profound thoughts about it. I think
6683840	6687440	if you look at human history, people always use technology for basically the same things,
6688480	6694480	right? Getting laid, killing each other, etc. So you'll produce amazing porn,
6694480	6699360	you'll produce amazing weapons, you'll produce amazing everything and then human beings are
6699360	6704720	going to do what they always do, I think is the truth, right? Like I remember, I think it was
6704720	6708000	Desmond Morris, I used to read a lot of his books. I don't know if you're familiar with them,
6708000	6711440	but it's one of the things he talked about. He said like when you dig up a clay tablet
6711440	6718800	in Egypt from 4,000 years ago, you read it is basically the same shit that we talk about now.
6718800	6724240	My son doesn't write to me or doesn't visit me or whatever. Human condition doesn't change.
6724240	6730800	The tools we use to express it do. I saw a report from an ancient stone tablet
6730880	6737520	from I think Egypt or ancient Rome that was a justification for why this
6737520	6741520	employee hadn't turned up to work. It was a sick note that he'd written and it's this
6741520	6747600	fucking elaborate story about what happened and the wife and there was a catastrophe and all
6747600	6752080	this stuff and yeah, you do realize that human nature is pretty fucking resilient over a long
6752080	6756480	enough period of time. But coming back, here's another thing I'll say about the free speech
6756480	6764720	conversation, which is that we haven't made nearly an honest enough case about free speech,
6764720	6770080	which is why we're having a stupid debate about it, because no one wants to say the truth,
6770080	6777600	which is free speech has consequences that are bad. There are people who say
6777600	6783040	are atrocious, horrific shit. There are people who will use the opportunity to be on a social
6783040	6790240	platform to mobilize and do terrible things. Now, there's a big conversation now about
6790240	6796400	whether there's a lot of antisemitism on X and actually there is. I have to block more people
6796400	6802560	than I used to have to block to on Twitter, but I'm still in favor of that being allowed
6803680	6808080	because I'd much rather these people were in the open and people could see what they are and they
6808080	6813600	can have their conversation instead of going off into a kind of like a private place where it's just
6813600	6817920	them and arguments are never challenged. So I think one of the things people don't say enough
6817920	6824000	about free speech is yes, it causes harm, but the harm's worth it. And we don't make that argument
6824000	6829360	because it's too honest and complicated and unpleasant and whatever. But the other side of
6829360	6833360	the argument is terrifying to me. I don't think I've told this story publicly, but last time I
6833360	6839200	did Question Time. Question Time is this big political discussion program here in the UK.
6840640	6847600	Before they show, they do a warm-up question that's not recorded and it's not released.
6847600	6854400	So it's like a warm-up. And the conversation at that time was Donald Trump had just been
6854400	6861840	unbanned on Facebook and they were asking whether that was okay. And they went to me first and I
6861840	6866080	was like, look, not that I'm his biggest fan, but I do think the former or sitting president of the
6866080	6870800	United States should be able to speak in public. Yeah, I do. Controversial as that is. And then
6870800	6875920	they went around the table and whatever. And then they went to the labor woman who was there. Very
6875920	6883600	nice woman. And she without batting an eyelid went, I think we should have the safest internet in the
6883600	6891520	world. And I would say for the North Korea, right, this is coming back to this point about trade
6891520	6896880	off denialism. Like they think safety doesn't have a price. And the other argument is freedom
6896880	6900480	doesn't have a price. And the truth is they both have a price. And what we're trying to find is
6900480	6907040	the right point in the middle between those two. We want enough freedom and enough safety. And
6907040	6910800	that line is somewhere in the middle. Because if you think about it, that's true of any issue.
6910800	6918160	I can end murder outside of the prison system today. I can stop murder and rape. Do you want
6918160	6924480	to stop murder and rape? Yes. Okay, let's lock up all men between the ages of 15 and 40 until the
6924480	6930720	age out of it. You've ended murder. Right. But we don't do that. Why not? Because there's a trade
6930720	6935680	off between safety and freedom. And so it's the same of everything. And it's the same with free
6935680	6942080	speech. You mentioned Trump. What do you think happens in 2024? I'm not an expert on it, but
6943520	6950240	it looks like they're going to try and put him in prison. And it also looks like he might win.
6952480	6956320	Is that possible? Yeah. Can both things happen? Can you be president from prison?
6956320	6960560	Yeah. You can be president from prison. Yeah. Fuck off. You can't be president from prison.
6960560	6964320	Look it up. You can be president from prison. Oh my god.
6964320	6967280	And you can run from prison. More interestingly.
6970720	6978480	I wonder, maybe if you are, I don't know, maybe you can't be president. You can definitely run
6978480	6982640	from prison. Maybe you get elected and pardon yourself.
6983360	6995440	Right. So you're okay. Let's say, let's say that there's no prison. What happens? Presuming
6995440	7000240	that everybody is a... But why would we presume that? I mean, I think it's pretty clear that
7000240	7005680	that's what's going to happen. Okay. The path that they're on, it looks to me like they're going
7005680	7011360	after him. We just had to score Adams on the show. And this is, he said Trump needs to win
7011360	7017440	to stay out of prison. That's what he thinks. And I also think that the other thing he said
7017440	7021840	is like, he actually interestingly said that he thinks Trump started this because when he talked
7021840	7027040	about Hillary and he said, I'm going to lock you up, they were like, oh, oh, you want to play?
7027040	7031360	Let's fucking play. So I think they're going after him now and they want to put him in prison.
7032320	7035360	And I think they will. But you also think that he...
7035760	7039920	I think he'll win the nomination for the Republicans. Yeah.
7040560	7044480	And then it's, I mean, who the fuck? Look at the last election. Who the fuck knows what's
7044480	7048240	going to happen? But he can run from prison that much, I know.
7048800	7054080	That's fucking insane. Vivek Ramiswani playing tennis with his top off whilst Trump's in prison
7054080	7059760	as the Trump Ramiswani 2024 fucking thing. That looks like what it's going to be, right?
7059760	7061600	I think that's what Vivek's going for. Yeah.
7061600	7063280	He's angling for it for sure. Yeah.
7064080	7066560	And who do you think gets nominated for the Democrats?
7066560	7070320	Well, it's going to be Biden, isn't it? I mean, they're not going to abandon him.
7071040	7071520	Unless...
7073120	7075120	Well, he falls down a flight of stairs.
7075120	7077760	Yeah. And in his case, it wouldn't even be a conspiracy.
7079760	7081680	Who do you think's the running mate? Any idea?
7082320	7086000	Nah, man. Look, let's be honest, neither of us is an act. Well, although you are now
7086560	7088160	an adopted American, so you probably...
7088160	7090400	An immigrant to that great nation, I know even less than you.
7092560	7096720	You know, I try... The more people listen to what I say, the less I try and talk about things
7096720	7102000	I don't know enough about. I mean, that was a Douglas Murray thing. He was... Someone had asked him
7104000	7108400	about two years ago, had asked him why he hadn't written many articles. He writes like four,
7108400	7112000	five columns a week. It's like 3,000, 4,000 words every week. And then his books and then
7112000	7115120	his speaking on top. Someone had asked him something along the lines of,
7115840	7120160	why haven't you commented that much on COVID? He says, I'm going to do something which is very
7120160	7124400	rare in the modern world, just to not comment on something which I know nothing about.
7125040	7132480	I thought, what a fucking beautiful and outlier philosophy to have. But this is...
7134240	7141200	I see this allure in myself and I have to check myself and probably fail almost all the time at
7141200	7149760	doing it. People start to listen to you about a thing or for a thing and you go, well,
7150800	7156880	why shouldn't I comment on the Ukraine? Maybe my take on the Ukraine is
7158240	7164160	useful. Maybe the world does deserve to hear what my thoughts are about immigration crossing the
7164160	7169760	channel. And then you realize... I mean, I've commented on both those things, but thanks mate.
7169760	7175760	But you are from the fucking region of the Ukraine and an immigrant to the UK, right?
7175760	7182000	That's a lived experience. Yes, exactly. I know exactly what you mean. Your point is very,
7182000	7187120	very, very valid. It happens with comedians incidentally, which is why comedians political
7187120	7192800	opinions generally speaking are so demented. Because you stand on stage all day making other
7192800	7198000	people throw their head back and admire you or be enthralled by you or whatever. And you're like,
7198000	7202400	oh, maybe I do know something. Let me give you my opinion about Brexit. It's like, no,
7202400	7206080	no, just be the clown. Shut the fuck up. Now, that's why I don't do comedy actually,
7206080	7212000	it's one of the reasons. I was more interested in making a point than I wasn't being artificially
7212000	7217600	funny. You know what I mean? And I always thought of myself more as a satirist anyway,
7217600	7223040	which was a different thing. But yeah, being in front of a microphone imbues you with a level
7223040	7228880	of confidence that is very often inappropriate. Right. It's like permanently being on
7231840	7236880	oratorial Viagra. Yeah, if everyone's listening to me, I must be worth listening to. That's
7236880	7240800	what happens in your brain. Regardless of what it is that I'm talking about, regardless of the
7240800	7247760	format or the, yeah, I've got these live shows coming up towards the end of the year, November,
7247760	7257680	mid-November. That's awesome. Thank you. What's your advice for someone who have touring comic
7257680	7264160	played fucking thousands of shows across your career? What do people who haven't put that time in
7264160	7269920	on stage not know about how being on stage works? This is going to sound like a shit answer. But
7269920	7274720	actually, it's stage time is just like air miles on the clock. Like with pilots, you have to fly a
7274720	7281840	certain number of miles. But I always think about whatever charisma, whatever else it is,
7281840	7288480	is really about a comfort with yourself in front of other people. Not everyone is equally charismatic
7288480	7293360	naturally, but if you're comfortable with who you are and you are able to do that while you're on
7293360	7300400	stage or in front of a camera or wherever, that's the magic ingredient. It's like my favorite quote
7300400	7304800	is the most important thing in show business is authenticity. If you can fake that, you can do
7304800	7310720	anything. Authenticity is the key ingredient, which is why I think you've been successful. I think
7310720	7314240	it's why Joe is successful. I think it's why Francis and I have had the success we've had.
7314960	7318640	I almost feel, I don't know if you feel this, but the longer we go, it's like the more layers of
7318640	7323600	the undone we peel off to reveal more of who we truly are. Yeah, I would say so because
7324000	7333840	you become more comfortable with things that you masked over before. Yes. There's uncertainty or
7336080	7342960	like nerdiness, I suppose, like unnecessary rabbit holes that you want to go down. And I've never
7342960	7346480	had this before. Obviously, you had this and you may have had it before comedy, I don't know.
7347600	7351920	But I never had a single pursuit that I got to go as narrow and deep on as I have on
7352000	7357680	having conversations with people. And when you really, really start to fucking like drill down
7357680	7364000	into, okay, what does mastery begin to look like? Which I'm not at, but I can glimpse.
7364800	7368080	I'm like, okay, what does that actually look like? What does that feel like? What does it look like
7368080	7372960	to make rules and then break rules and then put them back in again and do things? I'm talking
7372960	7381680	to some of the guys now I want to start doing slightly more scripted bits as a part of maybe
7381680	7386720	some of our ad reads as a part of maybe some of the intros. And that's like, if you actually look
7386720	7391600	at that, that's a very inauthentic way of doing what is supposed to be an unbelievably authentic
7391600	7398560	relatable medium. We're taking the rules from, you know, like sitcom legacy media to try and apply
7398560	7404240	that to this. But I actually think that that's breaking rules that have been made. And the
7404240	7408960	reason you can is because you've learned them unbelievably well, right? It's not not knowing
7408960	7414080	the rules. It's disregarding them purposefully. And I'm just excited. I'm excited by all of the
7414080	7418880	different options and opportunities and ways that there's cool stuff to do. And it's fucking awesome
7418880	7424000	to see what you guys are doing at Trigonometry. What I know about what's coming that more people
7424000	7429360	will find out at some point over the next however long is fucking amazing. I think that the UK needs
7430320	7437040	a nice movement, a good conglomeration headed by people who understand this industry
7437120	7441680	that can be a platform for others who have amazing and interesting things to say
7442800	7445840	but don't yet have the platform that they deserve to be able to say them on.
7445840	7450800	Well, this is what we've been working on for a long time. And I can't quite say exactly the
7450800	7454160	people and who are going to be involved other than to say they're going to be fucking awesome.
7454880	7460880	But we want to use the platform that we've built to make it so that Trigonometry is the
7460880	7466240	main show on that platform. But there will be other shows with other people and me and Francis
7466240	7472720	interspersed with other interesting, funny, hilarious, clever commentators, etc. So rather
7472720	7476960	than two Trigonometry interviews a week and some raw shows and a bunch of them,
7476960	7483280	we've started doing a lot of scripted stuff ourselves, comedy. I often record my sub-stack
7483280	7488080	pieces now and we put them out as videos. We had a couple of really viral ones. One I did
7488080	7491120	about communism and fascism. You did one about Jordan Peterson recently.
7491120	7493520	I did, yeah. That one's done very well, surprisingly.
7496960	7503600	But also we want to start thinking about how I'm thinking about us now as a media organization.
7504560	7509040	That's my frame for what we're doing. I want to bring other people through, help them make
7509040	7512880	exciting content that fits with the values of what we do. There's going to be entertaining
7512880	7519840	for our audience. There's going to be informative and grow it over time into a real hub for awesome
7519840	7525840	content. That to me is a super exciting next phase of this because I think the media industry
7526480	7531920	that we are in, the new media industry, is going to change rapidly. One of the things I see coming
7531920	7537680	down the pipe quite quickly actually is consolidation. This idea that you're going to give five quid a
7537680	7542640	month to your favorite 70 creators, it's not going to happen. The admin alone will kill you.
7543920	7547920	People are going to want a place. Obviously our politics are very different, but the model
7547920	7552160	of the daily wire is, I mean, they've executed it incredibly well. I went to go and see them.
7552160	7559600	I filmed on Brett Cooper's show four, five months ago, something like that. Anna, dude, it's a
7561600	7568160	machine workshop for creating content. Over there is the merch team. All they do is make
7568160	7574640	fucking tumblers and designs for t-shirts. Here's an entire three by 10 row of editors all
7574720	7581040	working away. Millions of meeting rooms. Here's an entire different building with everyone's
7581040	7587360	studio in it. Here's a control center that allows us to edit anything at any time. I found this out.
7589040	7595840	I'll check that this is okay to say. Shapiro has got some special fucking landline thing,
7595840	7603040	some special type of connection that runs from where he is in Florida to where the hub is in
7603040	7610240	Nashville that allows them to cut his show live as if they were on site. Wow. I didn't know that.
7610240	7615680	I've been in that studio a couple of times now in Florida. I've been to that one, but I've been to
7615680	7620800	the pipeline where that shit ends up at. Yeah, I've been there too. It's impressive. It's very
7620800	7626000	impressive what they built. Here's an interesting thing for you. Two analogous stories that I'm
7626000	7636240	sure that you've thought about before. The slow dilution or fucking explosion of the young Turks
7637280	7645440	and Crowder Daily Why, that you're talking about congealing or bringing together.
7646240	7653200	Meanwhile, a lot of the groups and affiliations and organizations, IDW, largely disbanded,
7653200	7659040	that wasn't an organization though. Loose affiliation of people. Young Turks, you say the
7659040	7662560	wrong thing slightly and downstream from that. Some people on the network don't agree with
7662560	7666720	other things that you've said. Like fucking apparently Ben Shapiro was Crowder's first
7666720	7672800	ever lawyer or some bullshit as well and then they've split off and they're big C conservative and he
7672800	7678160	turns out that he bought the URL only a couple of months after they spoke, but months before he
7678160	7684320	announced that he'd recorded these phone calls and all this sort of bullshit. So I think that
7684320	7690240	sometimes we're too quick to try and pattern match stuff. Yeah. And it's like, oh, all organizations
7690240	7697040	devolve into fractured individual groups or whatever, or all power becomes centralized
7697040	7702160	into one thing. It's like maybe it's just flux. Maybe it's just tides. Maybe there's like ebbs
7702160	7707520	and flows and stuff. Well, I think you're going to be able to continue to do what you do in
7707520	7713280	whichever way you want to do it. I'm interested in bringing people through who are very talented,
7713280	7717200	but who basically what we had to do with trigonometry and one of the reasons I haven't
7717200	7723200	made there a few money is that we have a big team as you do, but we've always had a big team
7723200	7729280	because we wanted to create the foundation for what we're about to do. And so Francis and I
7729280	7734080	really don't make a lot of money from it because we're investing in the future. And what I want to
7734080	7739600	do is we've kind of created a factory for making content. I want to bring people in who don't want
7739600	7745600	to build their own factory, but who are very good as creators of making content. Yes, exactly.
7745600	7750480	I mean, Carl Benjamin, load the seat. Yeah, he's done that. Spanked it. Yeah, he's doing very well.
7750480	7756800	They're playing a game of monopoly around the fucking some like transport police bullshit
7756800	7762720	somewhere in the country. And it's like they're slowly taking up the transport people have got
7762720	7768400	the corner office and got all of the ones that I decide. Apparently one of the guys was telling me
7768400	7773520	that he had some incident that had occurred at the railway line. He had some sort of stalker
7773520	7778160	that followed him at the railway line. And because it happened at the train station,
7778160	7782080	it's the transport police that pick up on it. And he rang them and the guy rang him back and he
7782080	7784880	could hear him through the wall. He said, mate, should I just come through, open the door and
7784880	7788480	was talking to the guy that was dealing with his case. It's like, fucking hell, that's interesting.
7788480	7794080	But yeah, you know, this, it's cool, man, it's cool. And it feels way more cool to see it happen
7794800	7801200	from grassroots, where you can watch episode one of some horse shit show.
7802000	7802400	Thank you.
7802400	7806400	With terrible lighting, fucking audios all over the place. And no one knows what they're doing.
7806400	7807200	Ugly host.
7807200	7810560	Ugly host. Yeah, that wasn't shit. And then you work to the stage where you're like,
7811600	7815920	holy fuck, like I can actually see the full trajectory of this entire thing laid out in
7815920	7821360	front of me, as opposed to like, oh, fucking Rupert Murdoch and is it part of...
7821360	7824000	Shady McShade face invested a million dollars.
7824000	7827520	Nameless fucking like hooded figures drinking adrena chrome dancing around a pentagram.
7827520	7828480	Yeah. Yeah.
7828480	7829760	That's where we want to go.
7829760	7830400	I understand.
7831280	7838320	No, but closing the loop on all of that, I just think this is the next phase in terms of what
7838320	7843200	we started with, which is let's stop whining about how we've been cancelled. You know, I think
7843920	7849760	it's been a thing of mine, which is like, we keep saying, well, the mainstream media isn't
7849760	7851840	doing this, then well, let's fucking do it.
7851840	7852880	Make your own mainstream media.
7852880	7857040	If you think that they're doing it wrong, let's fucking do it right. Let's do it.
7857760	7861680	And let's see who wins. That's the thing for me is like, I love the competition. I love
7862480	7865520	attempting to build new things, the creating the challenge of that,
7866080	7867840	working out how to run a business with...
7867840	7869680	Fucking immigrant mentality, man.
7870320	7872000	To me, this is the most exciting thing.
7872960	7878320	We were talking with good friends of mine last night about how much money you need to be happy.
7878320	7883120	And I was like, and somebody said that the statistics are $70,000 a year.
7883120	7886160	And maybe it's in like $2,000, but whatever.
7886160	7888560	Beyond that point, it doesn't really make any difference.
7888560	7890720	And I was like, well, for me, it does make a big difference.
7890720	7893520	And then I thought, you know what, what if I made a million dollars a year,
7894080	7899760	which is way more than I make now, but I wasn't having the experience of growing,
7899760	7901680	working with my friends, all of that.
7901680	7903680	And then I was like, actually, yeah, I don't think it is the money.
7903680	7906640	It's the doing it. It's the creating. It's the building.
7906640	7913360	This is why of all the people that I love to watch, I love Dana White interviews.
7913360	7914480	I was about to bring in Dana White.
7914480	7917280	He's a fucking... I just, I cannot wait to interview him.
7917280	7919440	You got him in America?
7919440	7921120	We are working on it.
7921120	7924720	So he's basically, he's open to it, but it's just about finding the right time.
7924720	7926080	As you can imagine, he's a busy guy.
7929280	7932400	I fucking love that guy. I love listening to the guy.
7932400	7936320	I love the way he dealt with COVID. I love everything about it.
7936320	7937520	You've seen that clip.
7937520	7939920	It went super viral a couple of times where he says,
7939920	7941840	bet against me. Fucking bet against me.
7941840	7944080	Tell me it's not going to work. I love that shit.
7944080	7945920	Every single time, man, like that energy.
7945920	7946880	I'm the same.
7946880	7949520	I really, really enjoy it. And I think that it's missing.
7949520	7955280	I think that there's not enough like conquerors in the world of personal development and business.
7956480	7962160	There is from a performative level, but I don't look at Dana White and think that he's saying
7962160	7964560	what he thinks sounds cool for people to hear.
7965440	7970400	I think he's speaking his philosophy forward, which is one of,
7970400	7972480	stand on this hill, come and have a swing.
7972480	7977840	Yes. Yes. And I've always been like incredibly competitive.
7977840	7979200	I thrive on it. I love it.
7981360	7985360	One of the things, by the way, you've told me, I will say this, is you were the first British
7985360	7992800	podcaster who was in our space who, when I've met, has been from a, who had a growth mindset,
7992800	7998000	which is why I said when we first started, how unsurprised I am by the amazing success you're
7998000	8002480	having because you've always had that attitude and it shows. And that's why you're successful.
8002480	8008800	And that's why you're friends with everyone in the industry. I just, I think it's a natural
8008800	8013040	concept. Your success is not an accident is what I'm saying at all. It's a natural consequence
8013040	8016880	of the person that you are. And Dana White inspires me in the way that I'm inspired by
8016880	8021520	your success as well, because it's just like, this is a guy who got his friends together.
8022240	8026240	They bought this thing for $2 million or whatever it was. At some point,
8026240	8031520	there were 30 something million in the hole and they just kept going until they crushed it.
8031520	8034160	And there's a lot of other things that they do very well. I think as a,
8035040	8038720	if you just switch on the fights on a Saturday night, you wouldn't see, but
8039680	8046640	they make it entertainment. They make reality TV shows out of the content. The way they present
8046640	8050800	the fights is like very well organized and it's beautifully shot.
8050800	8056480	Think about it this way. Think about what, if you watch boxing now, how fucking pedestrian,
8056480	8063200	unnecessarily ceremonial it seems. This fucking guy carries out a mace and Doth's cap and fucking
8063200	8069280	a list of 50 people who've donated money to this thing. We are here in the presence of the
8071280	8075440	by the Nevada state and the this and this and this. You're like, no, fucking just tell me the fight.
8075440	8079440	Yeah. Show me the fight. Give me the tail of the tape. Get me amped up. Let them punch each other.
8079440	8085280	And also what they've done incredibly well is with boxing, no one gives a shit about anyone on
8085280	8091680	the undercard or the card. They just care about the headline fight. UFC, the headline fight may
8092240	8096640	very often isn't the best fight that actually happens on the night. They'll be the best fighters
8096640	8099520	on the night, but it won't be the best fight. So you fight of the night will, I would guess,
8099520	8103520	only maybe 30% of the time go to the main car. Yeah. And it's just they, and therefore they
8103520	8106480	are building up other talent. This is what we're talking about with what we're doing. They're
8106480	8111920	building up talent who are not the headline fighters, but you're seeing them from an early
8111920	8115280	start and you follow them and you're like, oh, this person is getting better and they're fighting
8115280	8120880	this guy and whatever. So just from a business perspective, I am so inspired by that attitude.
8120880	8126640	I think it's, I love it. And I think we're probably going down very different paths in
8126640	8131920	that you've gone to America where that attitude is prevalent. I'd love to take it. Every time I go
8131920	8136880	to America, I come away buzzing, but I'd love to bring more of that shit here. That's how I see
8136960	8140880	our future. Sat next to the opposite Stephen Bartlett yesterday and said,
8140880	8144720	if I could gift the UK anything, it would be enthusiasm. Yeah. You know, there's just so
8144720	8149680	much enthusiasm in America. And there's fucking, there's also stuff that they're super shit at.
8149680	8154480	That's trade-off. Yeah. That's trade-off. I wish I could take some of Britain to America as well.
8154480	8160480	I went to LA, man. I spent three days in LA, sort of in the kind of like entertainment world,
8160480	8168000	you know, doing Bill Maher and stuff around that. That is a different fucking world, my friend.
8168000	8178160	How so? Oh, it's, I'm not a religious person, not yet anyway. But when I was there, I was like,
8178160	8186160	I can see why people need religion. This place needs God. It fucking does. I'm serious, man.
8186880	8193600	The way people think about other people, if all you have is your success, if your value derives
8193600	8199760	from your status and success, whoa, that gets dark quickly. Whoa, that gets dark quickly.
8199760	8204800	Finding disposable objects everywhere. Oh, man, it's fucking, the way people see each other,
8204800	8209120	there's no humanity there. It's just like you're an object for what I'm trying to get to.
8210080	8216640	And that was eye-opening to me. Hollywood makes sense to me now. The movies they put
8216640	8222080	out make sense to me now that I've been there. A lot of it makes sense in a way that I'd never
8222080	8228080	realized. See, I never realized how powerful Hollywood is at shaping our idea of what reality
8228080	8234560	is because the movies, like, we in Britain, we think we understand America, right? Because we
8234560	8240320	watch their content. That's why. But that's not the reality of America at all. And the more you
8240320	8245600	travel around America, the more you are confronted by that fact. You know, the more time I spend in
8245600	8254560	the US, it makes me more right-wing in the American conception of, like, states' rights.
8254560	8263840	Because I'm going, I had a flight from Salt Lake City to LA. And you get on the plane in Salt Lake
8263840	8269120	City and you arrive in LA, which is not that far. And you go, these are different fucking,
8269120	8274640	these aren't just different countries. These are different worlds, different religion, different
8274640	8279600	people, different way of thinking, different philosophy, different culture, different everything.
8280400	8286320	And the values are completely different. You know, America's an incredible place.
8287600	8293440	I'm really enthused by it. And there's also trade-offs to some of the way that people are
8293440	8298080	there as well. So it's actually, you know, we talked about masculinity and femininity. And I think
8300000	8304960	I actually know what people mean when they talk about toxic masculinity and toxic femininity,
8304960	8310480	which is you need both. You want to be thinking about it as raising both bars at the same time.
8310480	8316080	If you want to be a good leader, for example, right, you need to be strong and you need to be
8316080	8320080	able to say the thing that people don't want to hear and make yourself say the thing that you
8320080	8323920	don't want to say because you don't want to upset people. And on that hand, you also need empathy
8323920	8328320	and compassion too. Like you want to be raising both up. And I see that in the same way as culturally.
8328320	8332320	I want to take the best of the US stuff and the best of the British stuff and meld it together
8332320	8334560	into something really exciting.
8334560	8337440	Truck, yeah. Constantine Kiss and ladies and gentlemen, where should people go? They want
8337440	8341440	to keep up to date with your stuff. The best place to find my work is Trigonometry, of course,
8341440	8346480	on YouTube and the podcast. And I write on Substack, which has got really blown up at the moment.
8346480	8350320	I'm excited about that as well. And Twitter at Constantine Kiss and everywhere.
8350320	8352720	Hell yeah. Constantine, I appreciate you. I appreciate you, my brother.
8353360	8357520	Thank you very much for tuning in. If you enjoyed that episode with Constantine,
