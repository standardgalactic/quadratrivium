00:00.000 --> 00:04.760
If it's really the case that sex work is work, then what is the problem with being asked

00:04.760 --> 00:06.480
by your boss to give him a blowjob?

00:06.480 --> 00:07.480
It's work.

00:07.480 --> 00:08.480
It's just a service.

00:08.480 --> 00:10.560
It's like being asked to do it over time or make a coffee.

00:10.560 --> 00:14.800
No one actually thinks that it's just like making a coffee.

00:14.800 --> 00:15.800
Louise Perry.

00:15.800 --> 00:16.800
Welcome on the show.

00:16.800 --> 00:18.600
Thank you so much for having me.

00:18.600 --> 00:24.280
Given your political background, how does it feel to have Ben Shapiro quote tweeting

00:24.280 --> 00:25.280
your work?

00:25.280 --> 00:28.240
I didn't know he had.

00:28.240 --> 00:29.240
Did you not see this?

00:30.120 --> 00:31.120
Let me tell you.

00:31.120 --> 00:38.360
So there is a tweet that someone put out a couple of days ago explaining about how don't

00:38.360 --> 00:45.040
kink shame the naked men doing parades in front of children and twerking in front of

00:45.040 --> 00:46.720
cops.

00:46.720 --> 00:49.240
And that was one photo, which was a news story.

00:49.240 --> 00:55.640
And the other photo was the chapter list from your book, which said things like men

00:55.640 --> 00:59.600
and women are different and loveless sex is not empowering.

00:59.600 --> 01:06.880
And it said, people of the West choose your future, something like that.

01:06.880 --> 01:07.880
Wow.

01:07.880 --> 01:08.880
Okay.

01:08.880 --> 01:09.880
Yeah.

01:09.880 --> 01:10.880
Okay.

01:10.880 --> 01:11.880
That explains things.

01:11.880 --> 01:18.080
I have quite like a heavy notification filter on Twitter, so I don't always see everything.

01:18.080 --> 01:24.480
The contents page though completely blew up like three months ago, long before the book

01:24.480 --> 01:25.480
was published.

01:25.480 --> 01:30.640
The publisher just put up online the cover, the title, the fact that Kathleen Stock wrote

01:30.640 --> 01:37.200
the forward because she's got a kind of existing reputation among her haters, my haters, and

01:37.200 --> 01:38.200
the contents page.

01:38.200 --> 01:41.200
And that was enough to have like a several day Twitter storm.

01:41.200 --> 01:42.200
Why do you think that was?

01:42.200 --> 01:43.200
Those statements.

01:43.200 --> 01:48.760
I mean, I guess because, I mean, I did write the chapters with the knowledge that they're

01:48.760 --> 01:57.680
like, they're simultaneously obvious and also incredibly provocative, which was like

01:57.680 --> 02:01.000
precisely my intention because some people read it.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.920
I mean, some people read the whole book, but some people read the chapters in particular

02:04.920 --> 02:06.960
and they're like, yeah.

02:06.960 --> 02:15.240
And other people read them as like fascist, basically, I mean, like so politically outrageous.

02:15.240 --> 02:19.000
I mean, I'd say that the response to the book so far has only been out for a couple

02:19.000 --> 02:25.120
of weeks in the UK and not yet in the States is like 80% really positive and 20% complete

02:25.120 --> 02:29.760
outrage and not very much in the middle.

02:29.760 --> 02:33.240
I think, well, what do you think's going to happen when it comes out in America?

02:33.240 --> 02:36.120
That's a good question.

02:36.120 --> 02:42.360
I mean, the like the culture is more intense in America in every way.

02:42.360 --> 02:44.040
It's so similar, I think, to what we have here.

02:44.040 --> 02:51.560
I mean, actually, I think we import it really, but yeah, I don't know.

02:51.560 --> 02:59.240
I mean, I did, like British political context is different from American, right?

02:59.240 --> 03:05.120
And I write for the New Statesman magazine, for instance, which is like traditionally

03:05.120 --> 03:08.280
left-wing outlet.

03:08.280 --> 03:11.920
I have come from the left, even if I wouldn't necessarily consider myself still a part of

03:11.920 --> 03:12.920
the left and so on.

03:12.920 --> 03:18.440
So like, I hope the book doesn't just get treated as like yet another socially conservative

03:18.440 --> 03:25.120
take on such revolution because even if I'm reaching some conservative conclusions, I'm

03:25.120 --> 03:29.040
doing it via different priors, if that makes sense.

03:29.040 --> 03:30.040
Yeah.

03:30.040 --> 03:34.480
Well, didn't you say I start from feminist priors and end up with socially conservative

03:34.480 --> 03:35.480
conclusions?

03:35.480 --> 03:41.040
Yeah, some socially conservative conclusions, yeah, which means that there's sort of something

03:41.160 --> 03:43.160
in it for everyone to hate.

03:43.160 --> 03:47.160
Except Ben Shapiro, apparently.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.560
He's not read the whole thing.

03:48.560 --> 03:51.360
I'm not sure how he might think about some of the early chapters.

03:51.360 --> 03:56.360
You've been co-opted by the right wing of America now, and this is your future.

03:56.360 --> 04:01.680
So I was at the Heterodox Academy, Jonathan Heights organization, I was at the conference

04:01.680 --> 04:02.680
for that this weekend.

04:02.680 --> 04:09.240
One of the speakers said something that kind of, I think, sort of is a good synopsis of

04:09.240 --> 04:14.040
the thesis of your book that says, there are many ways to change the world, few will make

04:14.040 --> 04:17.000
it better, many will make it worse.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.200
Yeah, it's true.

04:21.200 --> 04:22.600
There's a real discretion quote like that.

04:22.600 --> 04:28.560
I can't remember exactly how it's phrased, but something like, it's really easy to break

04:28.560 --> 04:35.280
things and it's really hard to make things, which I think is, it's like a really fundamentally

04:35.280 --> 04:38.160
conservative observation.

04:38.160 --> 04:39.480
And true.

04:39.480 --> 04:42.760
What's wrong with the sexual revolution then?

04:42.760 --> 04:48.240
So my argument in the book is basically that there are some really important ways in which

04:48.240 --> 04:50.640
men and women are different from one another.

04:50.640 --> 04:55.360
So some of those differences are physical and should be fairly obvious.

04:55.360 --> 05:00.640
Like only women can get pregnant, men are bigger and stronger than women are on average,

05:00.640 --> 05:05.560
but also that the difference is massive between the, between the means.

05:05.560 --> 05:11.320
And also there are psychological differences, which a lot of feminism of the last half century

05:11.320 --> 05:19.600
or more has been really invested in minimizing, but I think definitely there, if you look

05:19.600 --> 05:24.560
at the research, and it will see just look at the world around you.

05:24.560 --> 05:28.560
One of those differences, for instance, is that male sexuality is different from female

05:28.600 --> 05:33.000
sexuality on average, that men are more likely to be into things like casual sex, watching

05:33.000 --> 05:39.120
porn, buying sex, all things that have become much more socially acceptable post sexual

05:39.120 --> 05:40.600
revolution.

05:40.600 --> 05:46.200
And my argument basically is that the sexual revolution was kicked off by the pill, and

05:46.200 --> 05:52.480
the, which, which did a pretty good job of severing the link between sex and reproduction.

05:52.480 --> 05:56.400
And it's kind of gave the impression that sex could just be a leisure activity that

05:56.440 --> 06:00.840
didn't have to mean anything, it could just be sort of a bit of fun.

06:00.840 --> 06:04.760
And my argument is actually that that idea that sex is just just a bit of fun, it doesn't

06:04.760 --> 06:10.120
really mean anything, suit male interests much more than it does female, because casual

06:10.120 --> 06:17.560
sex in particular is just one, one men wanting more than women do, and two women carry all

06:17.560 --> 06:23.800
of the risks associated with it, like physical risks like pregnancy and violence and so on.

06:23.840 --> 06:26.920
So my argument basically is it's a bad deal for them.

06:26.920 --> 06:31.960
Originally, it was the sort of thing that was pushed by liberals and feminists, right?

06:31.960 --> 06:33.520
This is exactly the sort of thing.

06:33.520 --> 06:38.440
Yeah, yeah, I mean, the, yeah, so the, the popular narrative that I'm challenging is

06:38.440 --> 06:41.080
one that the sexual revolution was like a feminist accomplishment.

06:42.280 --> 06:43.480
And I don't think that's true.

06:43.600 --> 06:46.360
I mean, which is not to say that there aren't some things about it that have been good for

06:46.360 --> 06:50.680
women. I mean, I mean, if you look at the story of recent decades in particular, there

06:50.680 --> 06:54.840
are all sorts of ways in which women are doing great actually, like women are women are going

06:54.840 --> 06:59.560
to university more often than men are, they are right up until they have children are

06:59.560 --> 07:00.760
doing better in the workplace.

07:00.760 --> 07:04.800
You know, this is, it's not to say that like everything is like the battle of the sexes

07:04.800 --> 07:06.840
women are like losing across the board, not at all.

07:08.160 --> 07:14.280
But I think in terms of sexual culture, that I'm concerned, I'm concerned for women, I'm

07:14.280 --> 07:15.240
also concerned for men.

07:15.240 --> 07:19.320
I mean, there's a lot in the book about, for instance, the really malign influence of

07:19.320 --> 07:27.400
porn on young men, like that in a superficial and short term way, it's great to be a really

07:27.400 --> 07:31.800
attractive man in this sexual culture, right, you can basically attract as many partners

07:31.800 --> 07:36.600
as you like, you know, consequence free sex is freely available to you.

07:37.080 --> 07:43.400
But I think actually in the long run, that's not a very, that's not a happy way to live your life.

07:44.360 --> 07:48.760
You say that your complaint is focused more against liberals than conservatives.

07:48.760 --> 07:49.320
Why is that?

07:50.520 --> 07:55.240
I mean, because I'm expecting liberals to read it, I might be wrong about that.

07:55.240 --> 08:00.200
But I that that's the space that I'm coming from originally, I went to, I went to such

08:00.200 --> 08:01.400
a left-wing university.

08:02.040 --> 08:02.600
Where did you go?

08:03.160 --> 08:05.160
I went to SOAS in London.

08:05.160 --> 08:06.120
I don't even know what that is.

08:06.680 --> 08:09.160
It's like a really, really small, really crazy university.

08:10.200 --> 08:15.960
So I, you know, I've, I've read all of the, all of this radical stuff as a student and

08:16.520 --> 08:21.800
I'm coming from a feminist background and coming from, as I said, the, you know,

08:21.800 --> 08:24.920
the new statesman that I work for is, is, is historically left-wing.

08:26.280 --> 08:29.800
So I'm kind of, I'm trying to speak to those people.

08:31.640 --> 08:35.000
But I mean, the books for conservatives as well, because there are bits in it that I

08:35.000 --> 08:39.960
think every, everyone will, will find, will find challenging.

08:39.960 --> 08:42.760
Is it not the fact that a lot of what you're talking about here is

08:43.720 --> 08:50.200
conserving some fairly traditional views around men's and women's roles with each other about

08:50.200 --> 08:53.880
sort of chivalrous conduct and having constraints on the way that men and their

08:53.880 --> 08:56.600
regression and their desire for multiple sexual partners.

08:56.600 --> 09:00.280
Like that, that is a fundamentally conservative value.

09:00.280 --> 09:05.320
So it seems to me like the conservatives would have far less to disagree with you.

09:05.320 --> 09:09.400
Not again, there's something for everybody to disagree with, but that the conservatives

09:09.400 --> 09:13.160
would probably have far less than the new wave of liberals.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.040
Probably, yeah.

09:16.040 --> 09:20.840
Although I should say that the, this idea of like constraining male sexuality,

09:20.840 --> 09:24.520
which is, which is, is, is central to my pieces basically.

09:25.720 --> 09:27.560
It is conservative in the sense that it was,

09:29.640 --> 09:34.360
it was considered to be like a mainstream idea before sexual revolution in the West.

09:34.360 --> 09:38.040
But if you look across time and place, like that's not necessarily considered like

09:38.120 --> 09:40.520
a trad thing to do.

09:40.520 --> 09:42.600
I mean, like, if you look, for instance, at antiquity,

09:43.800 --> 09:49.560
the idea that some high status man would have access to sexual access to his underlings was

09:49.560 --> 09:52.280
like completely accepted.

09:52.280 --> 09:55.000
It's really, I don't know if you've read Tom Holland's book, Dominion.

09:55.880 --> 09:59.480
No, you don't mean Tom Holland's the guy that plays Spiderman, do you?

09:59.480 --> 10:00.040
No, I don't.

10:01.160 --> 10:02.520
A common mistake.

10:02.520 --> 10:06.760
No, no, he's a British academic and historian writer.

10:07.400 --> 10:09.720
And he's got this fantastic book called Dominion, which is about

10:10.840 --> 10:15.560
basically about history of Christianity and the ways in which Christianity influences

10:15.560 --> 10:18.280
the modern world, even if we consider ourselves to be

10:19.160 --> 10:20.520
a religious or post-Christian.

10:22.520 --> 10:25.000
And he has a bit in there where he talks about me too.

10:26.040 --> 10:27.960
And it really triggered a lot of my thinking about this actually,

10:27.960 --> 10:32.840
a few years ago, where he points out that in, say, the Roman world,

10:32.840 --> 10:35.400
no one would think that Harvey Weinstein was doing anything wrong.

10:36.360 --> 10:41.720
Like the idea that this guy who's at the top of the tree of his particular hierarchy

10:41.720 --> 10:47.320
would be able to have sexual access to anyone kind of subordinate to him was like, yeah,

10:47.320 --> 10:48.280
obviously.

10:48.280 --> 10:57.480
And actually, the idea that he should be constrained is, Holland argues, a very Christian idea.

10:58.680 --> 11:00.520
And I'm not Christian.

11:00.520 --> 11:02.520
I'm not coming at this from a religious perspective.

11:03.240 --> 11:05.240
But it's worth pointing that out.

11:05.240 --> 11:07.640
You know, like this is not necessarily a normal thing to think.

11:08.760 --> 11:12.440
The window of trad sort of shifts over time, right?

11:12.440 --> 11:14.600
Like no one's actually going that far back.

11:14.600 --> 11:17.160
So, OK, so the sexual revolution happens.

11:17.160 --> 11:23.480
Like, surely women have benefited with no more shame and stigma around enjoying sex

11:23.480 --> 11:24.280
and stuff like that.

11:25.160 --> 11:27.480
Who benefited from the sexual revolution overall?

11:29.080 --> 11:30.520
Yeah, so the shame and stigma thing.

11:30.520 --> 11:33.320
I mean, yes, that is definitely one outcome.

11:33.320 --> 11:38.200
I mean, like, I think that one of the things that I'm trying to push in this book,

11:38.200 --> 11:43.880
and that is shared with, like, Mary Harrington and Nina Powell that you've had on the show before.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.640
Yeah, we're on the same page about this, like, challenging the idea of progress,

11:50.360 --> 11:56.520
particularly from a feminist perspective, this idea that history has a shape

11:56.520 --> 11:58.520
and everything is always getting better and better.

11:59.080 --> 12:03.640
And everything post-sexual revolution is necessarily better than what came before.

12:03.640 --> 12:04.920
I just don't think it's true.

12:04.920 --> 12:06.280
I think that's nonsense.

12:06.920 --> 12:11.560
Like, we're looking at a massive historical event triggered primarily by technology.

12:12.200 --> 12:14.280
Of course, there are going to be upsides and downsides.

12:17.320 --> 12:23.560
Yeah, so I think it is absolutely the case that women now can be much more open about sexuality

12:23.560 --> 12:27.320
and I'm more able to enjoy sex in certain circumstances and stuff.

12:27.320 --> 12:27.880
That's true.

12:28.600 --> 12:36.600
But I also think that to some extent, like, we're social animals and we're very responsive to norms.

12:37.480 --> 12:44.600
And what I think has happened is kind of the norms have just spun on a sixpence.

12:44.600 --> 12:48.440
And now, whereas previously, it would have been the case that young women, for instance,

12:48.440 --> 12:51.960
were like protecting their virginity and their reputation for being chased and so on,

12:51.960 --> 12:54.120
was considered very important socially.

12:54.120 --> 12:57.720
Now, if anything, it's the opposite or not quite the opposite,

12:57.720 --> 13:02.840
but that now the pressure actually is on for women to be up for it.

13:04.520 --> 13:07.800
And to be just as sexually adventurous as the guys.

13:07.800 --> 13:11.800
And, you know, like, it's like a slightly painful.

13:14.040 --> 13:17.320
There's a contradiction within that, which is really hard to navigate for young women.

13:17.320 --> 13:23.560
We're on the one hand, like, it's good to be sexually open.

13:23.560 --> 13:30.200
It's good to sort of base your reputation on being really sexy,

13:30.760 --> 13:33.800
but also there is actually a penalty if your body count is too high,

13:35.000 --> 13:36.520
which is quite difficult.

13:36.520 --> 13:39.640
And I think a lot of young women don't necessarily realise that as well.

13:39.640 --> 13:42.040
Like, they're actually treading a really difficult tightrope,

13:43.560 --> 13:47.000
which is why I think this idea of like, oh, well, people can do whatever they want now.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.520
Like, you know, we're all free to behave as we want sexually.

13:50.520 --> 13:58.920
I just don't think it's true, because every culture has expectations in relation to sex,

13:58.920 --> 14:01.560
has norms in relation to sex.

14:01.560 --> 14:07.080
I think that what we've done, though, is that we had some quite deeply embedded norms,

14:07.080 --> 14:09.960
which were thrown out the windows of consequence of sexual revolution.

14:09.960 --> 14:13.320
And now there's like a sort of halting effort to maybe rebuild them.

14:14.280 --> 14:21.240
Sometimes they're implicit and it's kind of a wild west out there, basically.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.560
Who's enforcing this, then?

14:25.560 --> 14:26.520
Where's this coming from?

14:27.080 --> 14:33.320
Are you suggesting that men are weaponising women to believe that they should have a particular type

14:33.320 --> 14:38.200
of sexual proclivity that then plays into men's hands because they get more variety?

14:39.080 --> 14:40.600
I don't think there's a conspiracy.

14:40.600 --> 14:42.760
I don't think that anyone is enforcing it.

14:42.840 --> 14:47.000
I think that it's just everyone, like, responding to incentives as individuals.

14:47.960 --> 14:53.560
And that knits together to create the culture that we see before us.

14:53.560 --> 15:01.960
So, like, yeah, it is in the interests of men who want to sleep around to encourage

15:02.920 --> 15:07.160
women to match them, you know, in that kind of behaviour.

15:07.160 --> 15:09.640
So that's clearly going on at an individual level.

15:09.640 --> 15:16.120
But then in terms of, like, women's magazines encouraging their readers to do the same,

15:16.120 --> 15:20.200
I have some, I did a lot of digging through women's magazines for this book.

15:20.760 --> 15:26.840
And, like, there is some really grim articles out there.

15:26.840 --> 15:28.680
What were your least favourite headlines?

15:29.560 --> 15:36.840
I can't remember exactly the wording of it, but there's a whole genre of articles in women's

15:36.920 --> 15:40.040
media about encouraging women not to catch feelings.

15:40.040 --> 15:47.160
Or, I mean, the way that it's phrased is how anyone of any gender can not catch feelings

15:47.160 --> 15:51.640
when they're having casual sex and how to have casual sex in, like, a fun, feminist way, etc, etc.

15:51.640 --> 15:56.840
But, like, we know that women are much more likely to bond quickly with their sexual partners.

15:56.840 --> 15:59.560
We know that they just much less likely to like casual sex.

16:01.560 --> 16:05.320
Something that's really interesting and really marked difference to many women

16:06.040 --> 16:12.200
on average in sexuality is women's sexual disgust threshold is a lot lower.

16:12.200 --> 16:16.520
So women will get the ick much easier than men will.

16:17.400 --> 16:20.120
But if you're going to participate, if you're going to have sex like a man,

16:20.120 --> 16:22.440
you have to overcome all of those instincts, right?

16:22.440 --> 16:29.480
And so there's a whole genre of women's mags that will basically, like, instruct their young readers

16:30.200 --> 16:35.960
in how to suppress their instincts and have sex that actually they kind of know deep down

16:35.960 --> 16:39.000
they shouldn't be having, which I think is really bleak.

16:40.040 --> 16:45.160
And, yeah, and I think that just representing that is feminist in any way.

16:46.760 --> 16:52.680
Interestingly, looking at it from a man's perspective, I agree that this is bad for women.

16:52.680 --> 16:54.360
I don't think that it serves their interests.

16:54.360 --> 16:59.080
I think that the biological predisposition that women have when it comes to sexual partners

16:59.160 --> 17:01.320
trying to decouple having sex.

17:01.320 --> 17:04.440
First off, having sex and making babies was decoupled.

17:04.440 --> 17:09.240
But then having sex and having emotions getting attached was decoupled.

17:09.240 --> 17:12.680
And that second one, the pill for that is, I mean, you know, what is it?

17:12.680 --> 17:14.120
Is it 10 vodkas deep?

17:14.120 --> 17:15.400
Like, does that really help?

17:15.400 --> 17:17.240
You know, you wake up in the morning and you feel.

17:17.240 --> 17:24.360
But you use this analogy about the fact that Marilyn Monroe was a sort of very attractive

17:24.360 --> 17:30.120
woman that was weaponized, commercialized, utilized by a society that wanted to sexualize

17:30.120 --> 17:30.600
women.

17:30.600 --> 17:35.640
And this was at the benefit of Hughes, Hugh Hefner, the sort of high status man who

17:35.640 --> 17:38.680
was able to sleep with lots of women and continue to do this.

17:39.800 --> 17:40.680
I agree.

17:40.680 --> 17:41.560
I think that you're right.

17:41.560 --> 17:45.560
It is bad for women, but very few men are Hughes.

17:45.560 --> 17:52.840
And what you're seeing in the modern society is this most women are probably dissatisfied

17:52.840 --> 17:58.440
with the way that their sexual pursuits are going.

17:59.480 --> 18:04.600
Most men now, the number of men reporting no sex between the ages of 18 and 30 has tripled

18:04.600 --> 18:07.480
to nearly 30 percent in the last 10 years.

18:07.480 --> 18:10.360
So the Matthew principle kicks off here.

18:10.360 --> 18:13.800
So I think on average, it's bad for pretty much everybody.

18:13.800 --> 18:18.920
I think that the sort of amount of sexual satisfaction has lowered for everybody.

18:18.920 --> 18:23.160
And you have this huge underclass of sexless men, which is where incel, black pill, make

18:23.160 --> 18:26.600
tau, some parts of the red pill, the manasphere, men's rights.

18:27.400 --> 18:33.400
All of these movements are, as far as I can see, they're big copes from men who are now

18:33.400 --> 18:38.760
in a sort of sexual wasteland where they're really, really struggling to find connection.

18:38.760 --> 18:43.320
So I think that it's, I understand that from a feminist perspective, it is bad for women

18:43.320 --> 18:44.920
and that there are higher costs that they pay.

18:45.560 --> 18:51.960
But being a listless, liminal space man with no desire from any female that you give your

18:51.960 --> 18:54.280
attention to is not a good situation to be in either.

18:55.320 --> 18:56.280
Yeah, I completely agree.

18:56.920 --> 18:57.320
Yeah.

18:57.320 --> 19:01.400
I'd add to that things like rates of erectile dysfunction among young men are like insanely

19:01.400 --> 19:06.440
high, which is probably suited for maybe also to do with Easter eggs in the environment.

19:06.440 --> 19:06.920
I don't know.

19:06.920 --> 19:07.880
God damn Easter eggs.

19:07.880 --> 19:11.800
So I was eating some edamame beans the other day and everyone at the table who's like big

19:11.800 --> 19:13.560
into health and fitness look disgusted.

19:13.560 --> 19:16.120
Apparently, edamame beans have got tons of estrogen in.

19:16.120 --> 19:16.600
Who knew?

19:16.600 --> 19:18.440
You can have a bit of soy, can't you?

19:18.440 --> 19:19.560
That's probably it.

19:19.560 --> 19:20.920
Don't go into the soy argument.

19:20.920 --> 19:22.920
But yeah, a few men are used, right?

19:22.920 --> 19:24.600
So they're the ones that are losing.

19:24.600 --> 19:26.360
Yeah, no, this is completely true.

19:26.360 --> 19:33.640
And I think as well that there's this like antagonism between feminists and let's say

19:33.640 --> 19:41.400
incels broadly, which does I think very much come down to these innate differences to male

19:41.400 --> 19:45.240
and female sexuality and the fact that we don't really talk about them enough,

19:46.360 --> 19:51.640
which means I think that you end up with the sex is really misunderstanding each other.

19:51.640 --> 19:52.200
Right?

19:52.200 --> 19:59.880
So like feminists will look at incels and like completely not understand why it would be

19:59.880 --> 20:02.040
so frustrating to be a young man who can't get laid.

20:02.040 --> 20:07.800
Like I think a lot of women are like surprising and clueless about male sexuality in all sorts

20:07.800 --> 20:08.440
of ways.

20:08.440 --> 20:13.240
Like definitely the dark side of male sexuality, but also just like its intensity.

20:13.240 --> 20:19.800
I think most women cannot just can't like directly empathize at all.

20:19.800 --> 20:24.040
And similarly incels I think would look at women and be like, but you can walk out into

20:24.040 --> 20:28.440
the street and pick up half feels and guys, you know, within five minutes, you must be

20:28.440 --> 20:30.440
living heaven on earth and women like, but I don't want that.

20:30.440 --> 20:31.960
And so you end up with this.

20:31.960 --> 20:37.240
Everyone thinks that like the other the other side has it easy, which has a lot to do with

20:37.720 --> 20:42.280
of just this like these quite fundamental biological differences, making it hard for

20:42.280 --> 20:44.120
us to empathize with one another.

20:44.120 --> 20:50.200
And this is added to a culture in which like not only are those sexuality differences

20:50.200 --> 20:55.000
routinely denied, but like the the existence of sexual dimorphism is routinely denied.

20:55.800 --> 21:00.040
It's like, how can you possibly like successfully navigate the sexual landscape if you don't

21:00.040 --> 21:01.240
even think many women exist?

21:02.040 --> 21:03.160
That's just great categories.

21:04.200 --> 21:06.040
Do you think that inventing the pill was an error then?

21:08.200 --> 21:09.800
No, because I think.

21:12.520 --> 21:14.360
I mean, socially, no, like that there are.

21:16.440 --> 21:19.720
Mary Harrington will probably talk to you about the environmental consequences of the pill.

21:20.600 --> 21:23.640
And yeah, we've just mentioned each other and that's like that's another story.

21:23.640 --> 21:26.120
Socially, I think no, I mean, I think it is.

21:27.320 --> 21:31.480
I'm personally grateful for the fact that my life is not entirely dominated by childbearing,

21:31.480 --> 21:33.880
which it would have been in a previous era.

21:33.880 --> 21:37.320
I'm not going to expect to have 10 children and to spend my whole life either pregnant

21:37.320 --> 21:38.040
or postpartum.

21:40.200 --> 21:45.160
I think it's more that we haven't really negotiated with the social consequences.

21:46.600 --> 21:47.640
And that's what I'm trying.

21:47.640 --> 21:51.800
That's the sort of conversation I'm trying to initiate because we, you know, we have,

21:51.800 --> 21:52.760
we have the power to.

21:52.760 --> 21:57.960
I'm not like a complete, I have a sort of materialist analysis of all of this.

21:57.960 --> 22:03.160
And I think in the end, it does come down to things like the pill,

22:03.160 --> 22:04.760
things like changes in the economy.

22:04.760 --> 22:11.240
You know, I think so often you get the popular narrative of feminist history

22:11.960 --> 22:19.080
is basically sees it as being driven by particularly inspiring feminists

22:19.880 --> 22:24.040
who just kind of give really strong arguments and everyone's persuaded.

22:24.040 --> 22:25.880
And this is what, you know, this is what gives us the vote.

22:25.880 --> 22:28.040
This is what gives us access to professions, whatever.

22:28.040 --> 22:28.840
I don't think that's true.

22:28.840 --> 22:31.960
I mean, clearly there have been some very impressive feminists historically.

22:31.960 --> 22:36.040
But I think that the real story of the last century is things like the washing machine.

22:36.040 --> 22:39.560
Yeah, you said the washing machine helped deliberate women more than any feminist did.

22:40.360 --> 22:42.440
Yeah, I think Jordan Peterson said the same thing.

22:42.440 --> 22:43.320
He's completely right.

22:44.600 --> 22:45.960
He also mentions tampons.

22:45.960 --> 22:50.600
Yeah, there's all sorts of, all sorts of technologies which make it possible for women

22:50.600 --> 22:53.640
to have lives outside of their home or more outside of their home than previously.

22:55.160 --> 22:58.600
And also changes to the economy, which means that, you know, if you're in a

22:59.240 --> 23:04.280
in a knowledge economy or a service economy where male physical strength doesn't have anything

23:04.280 --> 23:09.800
like the economic importance that it once did, women and men can participate basically as equals.

23:10.360 --> 23:13.320
You know, there are there are like, obviously childbearing makes a difference.

23:13.320 --> 23:16.040
But if you're if you're on the pill, you're delaying childbearing.

23:17.400 --> 23:24.360
You're working at a laptop and you're operating in a very kind of gender neutral social sphere.

23:25.320 --> 23:29.240
You might not even you might not even like work out.

23:29.240 --> 23:32.280
You might have no recognition of the fact that men and women are

23:32.280 --> 23:34.360
profoundly physically different in terms of things like strength.

23:35.160 --> 23:38.680
Like from that perspective, it looks as if the whole world is gender neutral.

23:41.000 --> 23:48.600
And so that's kind of that's that is the sort of social context in which this idea of the

23:49.000 --> 23:54.680
the difference between men and women being socially constructed or being trivial makes sense.

23:56.200 --> 24:01.480
But actually, that's like a very, very superficial analysis of what's going on.

24:01.480 --> 24:05.160
But actually, I mean, one of the physical differences is still profound, but also

24:05.160 --> 24:07.560
like those psychological differences go really deep.

24:08.440 --> 24:13.000
Because we're talking about hundreds of thousands of years of evolutionary history

24:13.720 --> 24:16.680
feeding into us having these really distinct reproductive roles and that

24:17.560 --> 24:21.640
and that leading to us having quite different modes of sexuality.

24:22.600 --> 24:31.000
Didn't you say that the USA women's football team was beaten by the Dallas under 15s football team?

24:31.560 --> 24:39.000
Yeah, yeah, there are like several examples of this of elite women's teams being beaten by

24:39.000 --> 24:40.040
teenage boys.

24:40.040 --> 24:46.040
I think that the the fastest woman in the 100 meters on the planet gets beaten by

24:46.840 --> 24:52.680
about 100 or 200 under 17s in America, 200 under 17 men in America.

24:52.680 --> 25:01.160
I mean, the whole like the discussion around male and female physical strength differences

25:01.720 --> 25:07.400
are purely due to the fact that girls get told that they need to play with dolls and guys go

25:07.400 --> 25:09.640
and lift lift little trucks and stuff.

25:10.520 --> 25:15.400
It feels like lapping to me, it feels like everybody is living this sort of charade

25:15.400 --> 25:19.960
and nobody can bear themselves to to pull out of it like that's wild.

25:19.960 --> 25:23.400
But when it comes to the psychological differences, there's a little bit more,

25:24.440 --> 25:29.240
I guess, plausible room for manoeuvre there because you can't see the manifest as much.

25:29.240 --> 25:33.000
And when you've also got a discussion about people being able to transition from

25:33.640 --> 25:38.520
different genders, the male brain and the female brain and traits that you put them on

25:38.520 --> 25:39.720
and take them off like clothes.

25:40.680 --> 25:45.320
Yeah, and there are outliers, you know, there are there are like less so physically.

25:45.320 --> 25:48.920
I mean, you do sometimes get really strong women or whatever.

25:48.920 --> 25:55.720
But even then, I mean, I do my husband and I are both power lifters and just I don't think

25:55.720 --> 26:02.520
that you can spend five minutes in a power lifting gym and not be aware of the fact that

26:02.520 --> 26:06.120
men and women strength differences are massive, even if there are obviously some really strong

26:06.120 --> 26:06.520
women.

26:06.520 --> 26:08.120
Do you pull conventional or sumo?

26:08.200 --> 26:08.840
Conventional.

26:08.840 --> 26:09.960
What about the husband?

26:09.960 --> 26:11.240
Also conventional.

26:11.240 --> 26:11.960
Good.

26:11.960 --> 26:13.400
It's a family of non-cheaters.

26:13.400 --> 26:15.240
I'm adamant that sumo is cheating.

26:17.240 --> 26:21.560
Yeah, I mean, and then I see I've been, you know, trading this for years and then I see

26:21.560 --> 26:29.560
like novice men warming up with my one red max and then it's just it's just like the

26:29.560 --> 26:30.840
pure reality of it.

26:30.840 --> 26:34.280
But I mean, if people don't participate in those kind of sports, also things like martial

26:34.280 --> 26:36.360
arts, if you don't participate in that, you wouldn't.

26:36.360 --> 26:37.480
necessarily know it.

26:38.600 --> 26:42.280
But on the psychological differences, yeah, there are there are more outliers.

26:42.280 --> 26:47.240
There are some people who are really atypical for their sex and there clearly is like a lot

26:47.240 --> 26:50.360
of space for culture to intervene.

26:52.840 --> 26:57.080
But it's so on an individual level, if you know what, if you know someone's sex, you

26:57.080 --> 26:59.880
don't necessarily know anything really about their personality.

27:00.680 --> 27:04.360
It's more that at the population level, when you're talking about millions of people,

27:04.520 --> 27:06.520
that's when you see it play out.

27:06.520 --> 27:12.520
And like something that is really interesting and really makes clear that how profound these

27:12.520 --> 27:17.400
differences are is you look at things like university campuses and look at their sex

27:17.400 --> 27:22.600
ratio on campuses where there are more women than men.

27:22.600 --> 27:24.520
So men are the rarer sex.

27:25.080 --> 27:29.560
There's more hookup culture because the rarer sex is able to set the terms more easily.

27:29.560 --> 27:34.280
And then on campuses where there are more women than men, so men are the rarer sex.

27:34.360 --> 27:37.080
There are more men than women, you have the inverses, more monogamy.

27:38.040 --> 27:41.480
And that's the sort of thing where, yes, there will be individual outliers,

27:41.480 --> 27:45.640
but you can't deny the differences when you when you see it playing out in those kind of larger

27:46.360 --> 27:46.920
arenas.

27:47.640 --> 27:53.880
Well, that sex ratio hypothesis is kind of the basis as well for a ton of hypergamy,

27:53.880 --> 27:58.840
that as you have an ever increasing group of high-performing women and an ever decreasing

27:58.840 --> 28:03.000
group of underperforming men that are dropping out of college, that aren't getting as educated,

28:03.080 --> 28:09.160
women age 21 to 29 earn 1,111 pounds more on average than the equivalent man.

28:09.160 --> 28:12.360
So during the period when women are seeking a mate,

28:12.360 --> 28:17.800
they're unable to find what fundamentally on average women want to find a mate that is

28:17.800 --> 28:21.400
more statusful, wealthier and better educated than they are.

28:21.400 --> 28:25.960
Those are the cues typically that they were attracted to, but now women are able to gain

28:25.960 --> 28:29.560
status, earn more and become better educated than men at higher rates than men,

28:29.560 --> 28:35.960
which is what's causing this sort of upward tilt toward turbo chad at the top sleeping with everybody,

28:37.080 --> 28:43.880
listless, sexless men underclass down here, and then the wistful women and alpha widows

28:43.880 --> 28:45.640
that are in this sort of world.

28:45.640 --> 28:51.480
I mean, this is the most interesting dynamic that I think there is at the moment when it

28:51.480 --> 28:52.280
comes to dating.

28:52.280 --> 28:54.680
It's got downstream implications economically.

28:54.680 --> 28:58.040
It's got downstream implications when you think about population growth,

28:58.040 --> 29:00.680
population decline, culture, crime.

29:01.480 --> 29:05.000
You don't want this huge underclass of sexless men roaming the streets.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.720
When you get into a relationship as a man, your testosterone goes down.

29:07.720 --> 29:11.720
When you have a child, your testosterone goes down again, because it's advantageous,

29:11.720 --> 29:15.720
it's adaptive for you to not be going out doing reckless shit when you've got a baby

29:15.720 --> 29:17.400
and a wife at home to look after.

29:17.400 --> 29:22.280
So all of this, I mean, this is just, it is by far the most interesting dynamic,

29:22.280 --> 29:23.880
I think, that's happening in the world at the moment.

29:24.840 --> 29:26.680
Yeah, and this is the subject of it.

29:26.680 --> 29:30.920
So my last chapter is called Marriage is Good, and a lot of people who've just seen

29:30.920 --> 29:36.680
the contents page sort of assumed that it's a Christian argument or whatever.

29:36.680 --> 29:42.760
But actually, it's making exactly, it's like a very rational, secular argument for actually,

29:42.760 --> 29:47.800
if you look at what happens to a society when you get rid of monogamous marriage and you

29:47.800 --> 29:53.080
compare our society and as it was in the past, and also look at societies where

29:53.080 --> 29:55.320
polygony is the norm.

29:55.320 --> 30:00.440
Like most society, I think it's about 80% of societies on the anthropological record

30:00.440 --> 30:04.760
have had polygony as a socially acceptable thing.

30:04.760 --> 30:11.800
So you end up with the chads who are having multiple wives, and then you've got men who

30:11.800 --> 30:12.920
never marry at all.

30:12.920 --> 30:17.000
And you do also have some monogamy in the middle, like it's normally not quite that extreme.

30:17.000 --> 30:21.560
But that, it seems, is basically our natural state as a species.

30:22.520 --> 30:25.560
And because it just, it just recurs again and again and again.

30:26.200 --> 30:32.520
And that minority of cultures that have been monogamous, including Western cultures, are

30:32.520 --> 30:37.400
unusual, but and it's not like it does sort of have to be imposed.

30:37.400 --> 30:42.120
Like, you know, like a lot of elite men will cheat, for instance.

30:42.120 --> 30:44.600
And, you know, they take on extra wives that they could.

30:44.920 --> 30:49.080
People, monogamy is not really our natural state.

30:49.080 --> 30:54.040
It does have to be socially enforced, but it also is like amazingly successful.

30:55.000 --> 30:59.640
Anthropologists talk about the puzzle of monogamous marriage in that it is weird to see that

31:01.480 --> 31:04.360
a culture like ours would have developed it in the first place because it clearly doesn't

31:04.360 --> 31:05.640
suit the interests of elite men.

31:05.640 --> 31:08.520
You'd think that the elite men would want would want to have multiple wives, which of

31:08.520 --> 31:09.160
course they do.

31:10.200 --> 31:14.120
But the reason they think that it's become as successful as it has is because monogamous

31:14.200 --> 31:15.160
societies do well.

31:15.880 --> 31:16.520
More stable.

31:17.560 --> 31:18.440
They're more stable.

31:18.440 --> 31:20.680
They're also more productive.

31:20.680 --> 31:23.960
So they colonize other parts of the world, basically, because they're

31:24.600 --> 31:27.160
wealthy and, you know, striving and successful.

31:27.160 --> 31:29.080
And then they impose their marriage norms elsewhere.

31:29.800 --> 31:30.520
Think about it this way.

31:30.520 --> 31:31.720
I've only just thought about this.

31:33.480 --> 31:35.880
The naturalistic fallacy gets used a lot with this, right?

31:35.880 --> 31:40.760
Look, ancestrally, we maybe don't have tons of evidence that we're a monogamous species.

31:40.760 --> 31:43.560
Their form of monogamy is not the strategy that we're supposed to go down.

31:44.520 --> 31:49.080
If you accept the fact that non-monogamous societies are more unstable and are going to

31:49.080 --> 31:52.520
exist for a lesser amount of time, that means that the living standards are going to be

31:52.520 --> 31:52.760
lower.

31:52.760 --> 31:55.800
That means that mortality or all of the things that you care about, right,

31:55.800 --> 31:56.920
are going to be out of the window.

31:58.360 --> 32:04.280
What if monogamy for the individual sometimes can be suboptimal,

32:04.280 --> 32:07.240
but on average is optimal for the culture as a whole?

32:07.240 --> 32:11.240
In the same way as when seatbelts got introduced, people didn't want to wear them.

32:11.240 --> 32:13.800
And a lot of the time it's not just you that you're saving.

32:13.800 --> 32:16.680
It's also other people in the car because if you don't have your seatbelt on,

32:16.680 --> 32:19.000
you bounce around and you smash up everybody else as well.

32:20.040 --> 32:27.080
Maybe a different way to frame monogamy is that it's kind of like following the law

32:27.080 --> 32:27.720
a little bit.

32:27.720 --> 32:34.040
It's a small individual sacrifice that you make that does perhaps make for some people

32:34.600 --> 32:36.680
suboptimal living standards, but only a little bit.

32:37.400 --> 32:43.640
But the reason that you do that is to contribute to the entire stability of society.

32:44.760 --> 32:47.560
Yeah, I've heard, I can't remember who came up with this,

32:47.560 --> 32:52.760
but I've heard monogamy referred to as sexual socialism, basically that reason.

32:52.760 --> 32:54.520
It's a redistribution strategy for sure.

32:54.520 --> 32:58.520
Yeah, yeah, I mean, I mean, we mentioned Jordan Rees again.

32:58.520 --> 33:00.840
He got in trouble for saying something along these lines.

33:00.840 --> 33:01.480
I can't remember exactly what it was.

33:01.480 --> 33:02.520
Enforced monogamy.

33:02.520 --> 33:04.680
I brought it up with them at the start of the year.

33:05.880 --> 33:10.280
Yeah, because it sounds really authoritarian, but I think what he was describing there is

33:10.280 --> 33:12.680
basically a weird describing where it's like socially prescribed.

33:12.680 --> 33:15.160
It's not even necessarily legally required.

33:15.160 --> 33:17.240
It's just considered to be the norm.

33:17.240 --> 33:18.520
Cheating is considered to be bad.

33:19.080 --> 33:20.120
You can't have a second wife.

33:22.760 --> 33:26.600
And yeah, I mean, there are other good outcomes also in terms of things like child abuse and

33:26.600 --> 33:30.360
domestic violence, which obviously something feminists are very interested in.

33:31.560 --> 33:36.440
Like polygynous societies have much higher rates of both because the household with

33:36.440 --> 33:41.240
multiple wives and their children are like full of conflict.

33:41.480 --> 33:46.600
A hundred times more likely that a child is going to be killed if they're in the household

33:46.600 --> 33:49.240
with one parent that isn't their biological parent.

33:49.240 --> 33:49.560
Yeah.

33:49.560 --> 33:51.160
A hundred times more likely.

33:51.720 --> 33:53.640
Yeah, yeah, it's insane.

33:54.280 --> 33:54.840
It's wild.

33:54.840 --> 33:57.800
Okay, so what's sexual disenchantment?

33:59.320 --> 34:09.240
So social disenchantment is basically, I took it from Max Weber, the sociologist who wrote about

34:11.240 --> 34:13.960
disenchantment of the natural world as part of the Enlightenment.

34:13.960 --> 34:19.800
So when people used to believe pre-enlightenment that the natural world was kind of possessed

34:19.800 --> 34:25.640
by spirits and had like agency and specialness like infused within it.

34:25.640 --> 34:29.960
And then we become more rational, whatever, opposed to enlightenment and realised actually

34:29.960 --> 34:32.680
it's all just like scientific forces of play.

34:33.720 --> 34:35.960
I think that it's not my turn.

34:35.960 --> 34:39.080
I borrowed it from Aaron Sabar, an American writer.

34:39.800 --> 34:45.080
Sexual disenchantment is what happens post-sexual revolution where you used to think of sex as

34:45.080 --> 34:46.440
having this kind of specialness.

34:46.440 --> 34:53.400
I mean within Christianity of being like a sacrament within marriage and then now it's

34:53.400 --> 34:59.800
stripped of all of that meaning and it just becomes basically any old social interaction.

34:59.800 --> 35:01.800
Like it's just a means of having fun.

35:01.800 --> 35:03.400
Basically, it doesn't necessarily mean anything.

35:03.400 --> 35:07.160
I mean, the point that I'm making the book is actually basically no one really believes

35:07.160 --> 35:08.440
in sexual disenchantment.

35:08.440 --> 35:13.240
People talk about it a lot and particularly like progressives and liberal feminists will

35:13.240 --> 35:16.920
talk about it as if it's an ideal.

35:16.920 --> 35:21.320
Like we should of course get rid of all these like stupid old fashioned ideas about sex,

35:21.320 --> 35:24.440
having some like innate specialness.

35:25.800 --> 35:31.080
But actually people don't really behave as if that's true because people behave almost always

35:31.080 --> 35:36.200
as if actually sex does have a special status and it's a special status you can't necessarily

35:36.200 --> 35:39.320
define very easily but people feel it.

35:39.320 --> 35:46.040
Like people care if they get cheated on even in the polyamorous community.

35:46.040 --> 35:52.120
Like if you go into any polyamorous subreddit or whatever, you will find people really struggling

35:52.120 --> 35:56.760
with jealousy as this like intense instinctive thing that they're trying to override and they

35:56.760 --> 35:57.480
can't quite do it.

35:58.840 --> 36:01.320
People, I mean it's sexual harassment in the workplace.

36:02.280 --> 36:09.320
I get really frustrated with feminists who claim simultaneously that sex workers work

36:10.120 --> 36:16.200
and that we should like get rid of all these hang-ups about selling sex being any different

36:16.200 --> 36:19.960
from working at McDonald's or selling any other kind of service.

36:19.960 --> 36:26.040
But then they also get so sensitive about any perceived section of propriety in their workplace.

36:26.360 --> 36:27.000
What like?

36:28.680 --> 36:30.600
Like being touched by a boss for instance.

36:30.600 --> 36:36.040
Like not even in a like a really aggressive assaulting way but just you know women getting

36:36.040 --> 36:40.280
touched on the arm or something like that or being asked out in a context that you don't really

36:40.280 --> 36:41.000
feel comfortable.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.560
You know all that kind of me too stuff which is quite low level.

36:45.320 --> 36:50.360
Like if that if it's really the case that sex workers work then what is the problem with being

36:50.360 --> 36:52.120
asked by your boss to give them a blow job?

36:53.000 --> 37:00.120
Right it's work, it's just a service, it's like being asked to do it over time or make a coffee.

37:00.120 --> 37:04.840
Or make a coffee yeah and no one actually thinks that that it's just like making a coffee.

37:04.840 --> 37:09.080
So I think that the sexual disenchantment idea is really just theoretical.

37:09.960 --> 37:15.720
It's a rhetorical kind of move but actually doesn't really describe reality and doesn't

37:15.720 --> 37:17.480
really describe how people feel.

37:17.480 --> 37:24.040
I mean it's kind of just an inconvenient fact that if you're trying to be super rational

37:24.040 --> 37:30.120
and you're trying to resist anything like remotely traditional or religious or you know

37:33.320 --> 37:39.080
anything old fashioned then the fact that people feel very differently about sex and

37:39.080 --> 37:41.960
they do about other things is kind of inconvenient.

37:41.960 --> 37:43.560
It's felt like an aberration right?

37:43.640 --> 37:49.720
It's like oh this is just an analogy drawn with the non monogamy community is so correct.

37:49.720 --> 37:53.000
One of my friends out here in Austin was telling me about the first time that his

37:53.000 --> 37:58.840
wife brought somebody else back and he was on the floor of the bathroom dry retching.

37:59.720 --> 38:06.040
But at the time he's now married at the time was adamant that this was just him working

38:06.040 --> 38:11.080
through his ego and this is in part of the process this is part of the processing thing.

38:11.080 --> 38:16.280
I'm like dude that's you're not choosing to throw up that's something way way way

38:16.280 --> 38:21.800
behind conscious programming that's innate that's built in but is it you that is this

38:21.800 --> 38:25.080
your quote that says few liberal feminists are willing to draw the link between the

38:25.080 --> 38:29.240
culture of sexual hedonism they promote and the anxieties of a campus rate that have

38:29.240 --> 38:31.000
emerged at the exact same time?

38:32.040 --> 38:40.040
Yeah yeah that's yeah yeah because I think what's going I think what's going on a lot

38:40.120 --> 38:47.640
with me too is that what what meets what was described during me too and still is I guess

38:47.640 --> 38:53.960
I mean it's still it's still going on in different forms right was not always right right like some

38:53.960 --> 38:58.360
so with like going back to Weinstein for instance some of what he did was like straightforwardly

38:58.360 --> 39:04.200
illegal and he was convicted of it therefore but a lot of what is described is much more

39:05.080 --> 39:10.760
somewhere in the middle you know much more open to interpretation and often what women were talking

39:10.760 --> 39:17.000
about was just like feeling creeped out or feeling like like exactly this dry retching on the bathroom

39:17.000 --> 39:22.840
floor feeling like your instincts are telling you something even if you can't quite rationalize it

39:23.560 --> 39:30.200
and often this was like expressed in terms of consent because in the liberal feminist

39:30.920 --> 39:35.560
framework the only thing you're really allowed to talk about is consent because you because

39:36.200 --> 39:39.480
all the old-fashioned norms are out the window you're not allowed to talk about chivalry you're

39:39.480 --> 39:46.840
not allowed to talk about um like any kind of instinctive feeling of disgust or discomfort

39:46.840 --> 39:51.720
that you have kind of has to be suppressed but you are allowed to talk about consent and so

39:51.720 --> 39:56.120
everything had to be expressed in the form in like the language of consent so I talk about for

39:56.120 --> 40:01.720
instance the Aziz Ansari case you might remember I can't remember the name of the grace I think was

40:01.720 --> 40:08.360
her her pseudonym this woman who went on a date with the actor Aziz Ansari went back to his house

40:08.360 --> 40:13.800
afterwards and he kind of he didn't rape her and he didn't do anything illegal but he just kind of

40:13.800 --> 40:19.560
subtly pressured her into doing sex things that she didn't really want to do and then later she

40:19.560 --> 40:26.120
wrote a sort of first-hand account of this um and he got in trouble but it was one of those

40:27.240 --> 40:30.520
it was it was a bit later on in me too and it was one of those ones that provoked a lot of

40:30.520 --> 40:34.120
discussion because it was because it was a borderline one like he hadn't had he done anything

40:34.120 --> 40:40.200
wrong he definitely hadn't done anything illegal um the idea that he hadn't that he had violated her

40:40.200 --> 40:45.880
consent just didn't really stack up just based on her own story I think what's often going on here

40:45.880 --> 40:51.320
is it's to do with this pressure that women feel to have sex like men

40:53.240 --> 40:58.440
and to try and have emotionless sex and to try and just like you know to do the sexual

40:58.440 --> 41:04.200
disengagement thing and just treat it like a like a leisure activity but they can't actually quite

41:04.200 --> 41:10.200
do it and they feel like they feel sexual disgust they feel shame they feel like these deep painful

41:10.200 --> 41:17.160
emotions and the only person sometimes to blame is the man even though he actually might not have

41:17.160 --> 41:21.320
done anything wrong really or he I mean he probably wasn't behaving like a gentleman

41:21.960 --> 41:26.120
but he wasn't doing anything illegal and he wasn't doing anything really wrong according to like

41:26.840 --> 41:31.800
the the standards of the day it's just that the standards of the day are not actually very good for

41:31.800 --> 41:37.640
women that's it you've nailed it you've absolutely nailed it there and you're right the the outlet

41:37.640 --> 41:44.360
for pushback and and for distaste the only one that is there is the man and the only

41:44.360 --> 41:49.320
framing through which you can talk about this is consent which is where false allegations I think

41:49.320 --> 41:57.800
sometimes come in that perhaps you repurpose ick as guilt as it must have done something criminal

41:57.800 --> 42:04.520
yeah now it's rape yeah and of course the nature of it is that there are only two people there

42:04.520 --> 42:09.480
there weren't any witnesses and so it's everyone's like analysis of something that's gone in the past

42:09.480 --> 42:14.760
is just really difficult and you know to be fair to a lot of men they're being

42:17.240 --> 42:21.640
they're being raised in the same culture where you're told that this is that women love it you

42:21.640 --> 42:26.920
know they I mean they haven't necessarily watched like Sex and the City but it's the same it's the

42:26.920 --> 42:33.640
same milieu where you wear like having sex like a man is aspirational and the idea is I write a

42:33.640 --> 42:39.720
lot in the book about pop culture examples of women who are clearly aspirational fictional characters

42:40.760 --> 42:45.240
who have loads of casual sex love it like don't have any emotional connection to the men

42:45.880 --> 42:50.520
that they use for sex and this is this is like this is this is aspirational you know and so and

42:50.520 --> 42:54.520
and young men are seeing this as well and they're also watching porn which gives a completely

42:54.520 --> 43:01.640
unrealistic realistic perspective on what women like and so you know they're clueless basically

43:01.640 --> 43:05.720
they're playing by the rules of the game as well or at least by the cultural influences of the game

43:05.720 --> 43:12.520
that they think are going on another another problem that you have here in the asymmetric warfare of

43:12.520 --> 43:18.440
the sexes is that men who begin to get a little bit of resentment for women let's say that they've

43:18.440 --> 43:23.320
had the heart broken in the past but that they are within the standard where they can keep having

43:23.320 --> 43:26.680
sex right they're not one of the underclass they're actually someone that can keep on doing it

43:27.480 --> 43:31.960
if they become aware of the fact that girls are trying to play this game of detached

43:31.960 --> 43:37.080
emotionless sex if they fully become conscious of that they go oh okay let's see who can win at

43:37.080 --> 43:41.960
this game the most because it's not going to be you it's going to be me and they can you know this

43:41.960 --> 43:45.560
isn't to say again on average this isn't to say that some men don't get attached after the first

43:45.560 --> 43:51.640
time they have sex so they go some of my friends fall pretty hard but they if they can weaponize

43:51.640 --> 43:58.200
that they can do a ton of damage as well and yeah i i don't know there's maybe an argument

43:58.200 --> 44:03.160
that everybody just needs to not be able to have sex until the age of 25 and then when they do

44:03.160 --> 44:08.200
they're like look i'm fully emotionally balanced i've been through a bunch of breakups i didn't

44:08.200 --> 44:12.920
have sex during the during the relationship i kind of know what i like and what i don't like

44:13.880 --> 44:17.880
i don't know i it's just so many describing there is marriage chris

44:20.280 --> 44:23.880
that used to be what it was you weren't allowed to have sex before you got married

44:24.840 --> 44:29.960
which gave which gave like men in particular a massive incentive to get their shit together

44:31.240 --> 44:37.800
because if you can't if you can't get married until you've say like achieved certain adult

44:37.800 --> 44:44.760
things like you've got a job you've got a house you know or like you've got whatever the system is

44:44.760 --> 44:50.280
like a certain amount of money that you can demonstrate your sort of eligibility as a husband

44:50.280 --> 44:55.240
if you have to get all of your ducks in a row before you can have sex i mean you can potentially

44:55.240 --> 45:01.960
buy sex but you can't have it like socially illicit then that that's a huge incentive

45:02.680 --> 45:09.480
to behave yourself and to do pro-social stuff whereas if you have a scenario now where either

45:10.680 --> 45:17.000
either you're like attractive enough that you can get sex casual sex without having to

45:17.640 --> 45:22.920
to do anything really except be like moderately charming or you can get sex

45:24.280 --> 45:27.560
through all you all you have access to porn which like gives you the

45:27.960 --> 45:34.200
of gives some of the same like feedback from your environment as if you were actually having sex

45:34.200 --> 45:38.920
like i mean this would get so this will get so much worse with sex robots

45:40.040 --> 45:44.600
where all of a sudden you can like basically bypass all of the effort that you might historically

45:44.600 --> 45:49.400
have had to put in in order to access sex you can just buy a sex robot and you can spend your whole

45:49.400 --> 45:56.840
life playing video games never going to gym never showering never having a job and you still

45:56.840 --> 46:01.080
get access to this thing that your ancestors like fought teeth and nails to get access to

46:01.720 --> 46:07.640
even without the sex robots men are retreating i think from from the dating market terrifying

46:08.440 --> 46:14.040
terrifying rates there's a quote that rob henderson came up with which is this a similar

46:14.040 --> 46:18.920
sort of dynamic that we're talking about here says norms were loosened around being an absentee

46:18.920 --> 46:23.400
father so more men took the option but nobody wants to admit it because it upsets people

46:23.400 --> 46:27.720
instead we retreat to discussions of poverty and economics because talking about family and

46:27.720 --> 46:34.120
parenting makes people feel weird and judgmental but young men will only do what's expected of them

46:34.120 --> 46:39.800
and a lot did use to be expected there were social norms to work hard provide take care of loved ones

46:39.800 --> 46:46.120
and so on today these norms have largely dissolved young men have responded accordingly yeah he's

46:46.120 --> 46:52.760
very very smart rob henderson he's completely right um yeah i mean i think that i think that the

46:54.200 --> 46:57.160
the line i have in the book about debbie dad's is that when

46:59.320 --> 47:03.720
when motherhood became a biological choice for women fatherhood became a social choice for men

47:04.360 --> 47:10.840
what do you mean by that in the when contraception and legalized abortion became available

47:11.480 --> 47:17.880
i mean that basically killed the shotgun marriage pretty much immediately because it no longer

47:17.880 --> 47:26.520
served the same social purpose that it had before um but the nature of contraception is such that

47:26.520 --> 47:32.120
nothing is 100% foolproof and actually the pill particularly in its earliest incarnations wasn't

47:32.120 --> 47:37.320
that great and still isn't that great because it depends a lot on the user using it properly so if

47:37.320 --> 47:43.400
you're using it properly it's like 99 plus effective but in reality it's more like 91 so you

47:43.400 --> 47:47.160
end up with a lot of unplanned pregnancies and there will always be someone who don't want to

47:47.160 --> 47:53.400
have a termination for whatever reason um but if you're in a social context where like

47:55.560 --> 47:58.920
there isn't necessarily considered to be a link between sex and reproduction

47:58.920 --> 48:05.400
and getting pregnant is considered to be like this unwelcome aberration rather than literally the

48:05.400 --> 48:12.120
whole point then it becomes much more socially acceptable for men to not stick around because

48:12.120 --> 48:19.480
they say well you chose this you know you're on your own which is yeah i mean obviously there have

48:19.480 --> 48:24.440
always been cases of people i've had some critics pointing this out you know they've always been

48:24.440 --> 48:29.640
cases of men abandoning their wives or abandoning women that they think that they made pregnant

48:29.640 --> 48:33.320
outside of marriage you know they've always been scandals they've always been unwanted

48:34.040 --> 48:40.440
pregnancies whatever like that's absolutely true but rates of out of wedlock births now are

48:40.440 --> 48:45.240
completely historically unprecedented which is kind of weird because you would think that

48:45.880 --> 48:50.440
giving women the technology that enables them to control their fertility would reduce single

48:50.440 --> 48:55.240
motherhood but it's done the opposite because humans are humans are complicated creatures

48:55.240 --> 49:01.000
that's what i learned from mary harrington that you introduce the pill single single motherhood

49:01.000 --> 49:07.000
goes up like who the fuck could have predicted that right you know that's four degrees of detachment

49:07.000 --> 49:18.520
away you know it's so interesting but also kind of tragic but it's it seems like women it was it

49:18.520 --> 49:23.720
was a perfect storm right you had the the decoupling socially then you had the decoupling

49:23.720 --> 49:30.200
biologically but you haven't had the decoupling emotionally it's still that

49:31.400 --> 49:34.920
fundamentally there will be some women that are able to have sex like a man

49:34.920 --> 49:38.200
and there will be some able there's a man the men that are able to have sex like a man

49:38.200 --> 49:42.520
but on average it used to be something that you work toward for a long time it used to be the

49:42.520 --> 49:47.720
sort of thing and think about now i was uh sent another article by rob the other day where he

49:47.720 --> 49:57.400
was talking about why is it that parents tend to select when when their daughter or son brings

49:57.400 --> 50:04.680
home a new potential partner they look at things like job title earnings family and he asked why

50:04.680 --> 50:08.840
is that the case why is it that you look at these when you know they're not looking at how hot they

50:08.840 --> 50:14.440
are not looking at a detraction and stuff like that even kindness kind of takes a little bit of a

50:14.440 --> 50:20.520
back seat and it's less falsifiable basically the fact is look these are the things that are

50:20.520 --> 50:29.720
going to be the most likely to become grandchild optimizing algorithms do you have status do you

50:29.720 --> 50:34.840
have money do you have the right family behind you if you've got those i'm probably gonna have

50:34.840 --> 50:41.320
grandchildren all of the other ones are wishy washy and and kind of easy to to fake in a way

50:42.040 --> 50:47.400
um why why is it then that loveless sex isn't empowering

50:51.960 --> 51:00.680
yeah i mean because because your animal brain which none of us are completely in control of

51:02.040 --> 51:07.240
for women in particular even if there are some allies as you mentioned i mean often the outliers

51:07.240 --> 51:11.720
like often women who who don't get attached to sex for instance have like a history of sexual

51:11.720 --> 51:16.200
trauma there's often not a very healthy reason behind it but you know like accepting the fact

51:16.200 --> 51:22.200
that there are outliers your animal brain thinks that this guy is going to knock you up and like

51:22.200 --> 51:30.600
you are going to become a profoundly vulnerable mother baby dyad you know like human infants are

51:30.600 --> 51:38.040
insanely vulnerable they need so much more care than any other as far as i know any other species

51:38.040 --> 51:45.800
young um and mothers are also extremely vulnerable in the later stages of pregnancy and in and during

51:45.800 --> 51:51.400
infancy you have to put so much energy and sacrifice so much in order to raise this child

51:51.400 --> 51:58.920
to adulthood and that before like five minutes ago in our evolutionary history was what happened

51:58.920 --> 52:05.480
or was certainly what you risked happening if you had sex had heterosexual sex and so

52:06.600 --> 52:14.280
like our brains are still primed for that and that's the whole that's the whole purpose behind

52:15.400 --> 52:20.360
emotional attachment to a sexual partner and also the whole purpose behind like choosing

52:20.360 --> 52:25.640
your sexual partner and the fact that women do tend to be a lot choosier than men there's these

52:25.640 --> 52:32.680
quite funny studies that have been done several times where they um they get like quite attractive

52:32.680 --> 52:37.400
strangers to go up to men and women i think on university campuses normally in proposition them

52:37.400 --> 52:44.040
and when the women proposition male strangers they almost always say yes or and if they say no it's

52:44.040 --> 52:48.360
because they have a girlfriend or whatever whereas when the men proposition the women they always say

52:48.360 --> 52:57.400
no because women like their filter is impregnable um and there's a reason for that it's because you

52:57.400 --> 53:03.640
don't want some some like to be knocked up by some bozo it's just one of the reasons why prostitution

53:03.640 --> 53:08.920
is as traumatic as it is i mean there are all there are all of the physical risk and bulging

53:08.920 --> 53:15.560
prostitution like rates of murder are insanely high you know it's it's it's it's if we were to

53:15.560 --> 53:20.040
compare it to another profession it would be by far the most dangerous profession ever like rates of

53:20.040 --> 53:25.720
PTSD and much higher than in the military for instance but one of the reasons why it's so profoundly

53:25.720 --> 53:30.040
distressing is that women have this really really strong instinct to like vet their sexual partners

53:30.040 --> 53:35.240
and to only have sex with men who seem like good prospects and women also have a very heart a very

53:35.240 --> 53:41.880
low sexual disgust threshold which means that they get the ick very readily with a man that they don't

53:41.880 --> 53:45.880
fancy and what what women and prostitution are basically required to do is to override that

53:46.440 --> 53:51.480
and to suppress those instincts if you talk to women who've who've experienced it they often

53:51.480 --> 53:57.400
talk about like working really hard to dissociate from their physical feelings it is that is that

53:57.400 --> 54:01.720
retching on the bathroom floor thing i mean actually retching maran whose prostitution

54:01.720 --> 54:06.040
survivor and has written this amazing book called paid for it's a memoir of her experiences

54:07.080 --> 54:11.160
she talks about that the fact that not vomiting is one of the most important skills a prostitute

54:11.160 --> 54:17.560
can have because your your your physical urge to run away and to cry into vomit is that strong

54:17.560 --> 54:25.800
that you have to like fight it down and i think that if you know in a much less extreme circumstances

54:25.800 --> 54:35.320
obviously but when women are trying to like to to to play the masculine role and imitate male

54:35.320 --> 54:40.280
sexuality and to enjoy sex in the way that they think they're supposed to they are basically

54:40.280 --> 54:44.680
obliged to suppress their instincts which isn't isn't at all psychologically healthy

54:45.400 --> 54:51.560
has normalising sex work like only funds been a benefit for women i mean they clearly are some

54:51.560 --> 54:56.520
women are only fans who make a lot of money from it so there are some winners i mean

54:58.040 --> 55:05.000
they they are very unusual most women on only fans probably make a loss in terms of the amount

55:05.000 --> 55:09.480
of time they have to spend because the perito distribution on only fans is wild and most of

55:09.480 --> 55:14.520
the women who do really well on it are already celebrities and already quite wealthy so this

55:14.520 --> 55:20.280
idea that you can just be like as long as you're sufficiently pretty you log on and you're making

55:20.280 --> 55:25.960
a fortune is not true and i'm sure has been deliberately whipped up that idea by only fans

55:25.960 --> 55:31.400
because they're the only people actually really profiting at the end of the day um i mean i think

55:31.400 --> 55:36.200
the only fans is not like street prostitution or brothel prostitution like it's clearly not the same

55:36.840 --> 55:44.040
i like it's pretty gross and the and you will have men asking you to do things that really turn

55:44.040 --> 55:51.640
your stomach but it's clearly not like physically dangerous i think that the main risk of only fans

55:51.640 --> 55:58.280
is your ability to have a long-term relationship afterwards because you end up putting your images

55:58.280 --> 56:02.360
out in the world and you can't get them back that's an issue of the internet and often only

56:02.360 --> 56:07.480
fans creators get their images stolen and so they'll be shared and they don't even get any money from it

56:08.440 --> 56:16.440
and the risk is in the future that even though men don't always admit it

56:18.120 --> 56:22.760
the sexual double standard is still actually really alive and well if you so sexual double

56:22.760 --> 56:29.320
standard being when men are kind of permitted to be a bit promiscuous and that's okay socially

56:29.320 --> 56:34.760
but women tend to be punished for promiscuity i think that only fans goes beyond promiscuity

56:34.760 --> 56:40.680
you know the double standard didn't account it's not men wanking on camera and then trying to find

56:40.680 --> 56:44.920
a wife and them saying uh my friends shared something in a whatsapp chat earlier on and that

56:44.920 --> 56:55.800
kind of looks a little bit like you what about um normalizing uh like love sex workers like sex

56:55.800 --> 57:02.360
workers uh you should be completely fine with your partner doing only fans or perhaps even escorting

57:03.560 --> 57:10.840
i mean crazy what kind of yeah i mean either i think if i think if a man is really comfortable

57:10.840 --> 57:17.320
with that that's like a red flag to me honestly like again it's an example of men suppressing

57:17.320 --> 57:23.880
their instincts because the the instinct towards jealousy is so strong and again has such an

57:23.880 --> 57:32.360
obvious evolutionary origin to it um because if you're putting loads of resources into raising

57:32.360 --> 57:35.720
children that you've had with this woman you want to know they're yours like that's

57:35.720 --> 57:42.120
make guarding is what the um biologists call it and it's it's so common that i think it's

57:42.120 --> 57:48.600
considered to be a human universal and yeah like there are there are loads of sort of unwelcome

57:48.600 --> 57:54.440
phenomena that come from that you know jealousy is often um the motive behind domestic violence

57:54.440 --> 58:00.280
for instance because i you know you mentioned the naturalistic fallacy like the fact that it's

58:00.280 --> 58:05.400
natural doesn't mean it's necessarily good but it does also mean that trying to completely override

58:05.400 --> 58:09.880
it is probably not gonna work like you have to find a way of accommodating your instincts you

58:09.880 --> 58:16.360
can't just try and suppress them and try and like like rewrite the human blueprint well that's where

58:17.080 --> 58:22.920
that's where i think the um it's not men that are encouraging women to do only fans

58:23.560 --> 58:30.280
i don't see men on the internet saying that you should go and the you girl should ditch your

58:30.280 --> 58:35.240
job and go and do it the only people online saying sex work is real work seems to be women

58:35.240 --> 58:40.280
yes men are the ones that are paying for their images once they're in the game but i think

58:41.080 --> 58:46.200
that's because once women cross that threshold and become a sex worker or whatever they're almost

58:46.920 --> 58:51.720
kind of not subhuman but they're in a different category right and it's like oh well they're

58:51.720 --> 58:55.240
doing it i didn't get them into it so i'm just going to continue to fund them but if you were to

58:55.240 --> 59:01.400
say to most men i think would you advise that pretty girl to get into only fans so that you

59:01.400 --> 59:08.280
can see her nudes most of them would say probably not probably not but almost every healthy man would

59:08.280 --> 59:12.920
say no right they'd say no i'll try and go out with her or maybe she should just go and enjoy her

59:12.920 --> 59:17.480
life or do whatever but once they're in the game that's what's going to happen but you have this

59:17.480 --> 59:24.920
this very bizarre sort of cartel i don't know it's like uh self not self oppression but like

59:26.280 --> 59:31.320
self capitalization from women of women encouraging other women to go and do the game

59:31.320 --> 59:33.960
despite the fact that the chances of you making money on only fans is

59:34.760 --> 59:39.640
minuscule low when it comes to actually making the tens of thousands of dollars a day that the

59:39.720 --> 59:47.400
biggest creators make and yeah i mean even even if you were able to have an unbelievably secure

59:47.400 --> 59:53.640
only fans that was never able to leak your photos online you have two choices for the remainder of

59:53.640 --> 59:57.960
your life when you get into talking to a new partner you can either tell them the truth and

59:59.240 --> 01:00:03.240
regardless of how comfortable that guy is with his sexuality finding out that his miss is

01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:09.080
forget body count even if you've only slept with one other person but that was something that you

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:17.400
did you can't like left brain your way out of thinking that that is oh god well if she did that

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:22.120
in the past does this mean that she's maybe going to she's a risk for promiscuity in the future like

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:27.640
the cook radar is so hyper attuned for men which is why we get more jealous or the other one is to

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:35.800
lie to him cook radar is interesting praise good coinage game because i have you because i have

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:42.920
used the i've i've i've don't write it in the book but i um like talked about on twitter non-trader

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:50.680
i think that women have really strongly i mean i think men do as well but i think women in

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:54.840
particular have a really strong like it's i think it's hardly a sexual disgusting is that feeling

01:00:54.840 --> 01:01:00.280
of like this guy is creepy and i think that it i think it's like female intuition right and i

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:03.640
think it's coming it's probably partly coming from wanting to protect yourself is also partly

01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:08.600
wanting to protect your children you've got that like this guy's bad news yeah if i'm gonna sleep

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:15.080
with him what's he gonna do to the kids perhaps i saw i got to tell you about this uh meme that i

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:21.240
saw so carl benjamin sargon of a cad a guy who uh has incredibly conservative views about this stuff

01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:25.320
but aligns completely with what we're saying here he posted a meme the other day and it had a girl

01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:29.320
from only fans in like a bikini or laundry or whatever sort of dancing away on one side and

01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:34.040
had michael scott from the office on the other sort of looking strangely and the text said

01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:39.480
we call it female empowerment and they will dance naked for the price of a cheeseburger

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:46.760
yeah yeah i mean this question you raise about why women encouraging each other to do it you're

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:50.600
right i mean one exception i would give this idea of a friend who went on a date with a guy who said

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:55.800
you're so hot you should be on only fans and she did not go on a date with him again because it was

01:01:55.800 --> 01:02:02.600
just so obviously i know failing strategy i think yeah because the way that she interpreted it and

01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:07.960
i think correctly was that he was he was clearly not regarding her as like wife material right

01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:11.880
and this is this is i think an error that women do make sometimes where they don't have a good

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:17.400
understanding of male sexuality and they don't it's really interesting i don't know if you read

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:22.680
david busser's book bad men i absolutely love it yeah i brought him on for this fantastic book yeah

01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:27.480
and he talks about the fact that women tend to assess like short-term partners and long-term

01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:33.240
partners based on the same uh qualities they want the same things in all the men they have

01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:38.600
sex with men don't do that they have a much lower standard for their short-term partners and they do

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:42.360
for long-term partners and so they will be willing to have sex with a woman that they absolutely

01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:47.080
would not marry they would not even introduce to their friends and i think a lot of women don't

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:54.440
necessarily know that and so they will interpret sexual advances from men as flattering when

01:02:54.440 --> 01:03:01.160
actually they can are potentially like cheap you know this is the genesis of the alpha widow

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:06.840
right like this is what many girls that are liberated sexually and using tinder and stuff

01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:12.680
like that don't get and i think that this is another i'm i'm actually not so convinced about

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:18.040
quite how big of an effect this is i'd need to see rob go and do some research about it

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:22.520
but certainly women are able to sleep with men that they wouldn't be able to get into a relationship

01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:28.440
with but the reverse isn't true and there is an argument that the the aftershock of this means that

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:34.200
those women are going to constantly pine after the nine out of ten guy that's worth half a million

01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:42.040
and all that i'm not sure about how long that would last for and the echoes of that and stuff

01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:47.960
like that but i certainly think that um what porn has done to men which is to teach them that women

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:53.560
are to be objectified is similar in part to what only fans has done to women which is to teach

01:03:53.560 --> 01:04:00.120
some women that men are commercial vehicles to be exploited and that their sex is just a

01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:08.120
it's a commodity you can trade it like anything else yeah and it's not i think as well some women

01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:16.280
who are already like posting a lot of raunchy photos on instagram don't necessarily feel like

01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:21.480
only fans is that biggest step it's just a bit more explicit and you get paid for it so you can

01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:29.560
sort of see the reasoning and what some women say and i i get it is that you know yes maybe that it

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:32.760
means that some men in the future wouldn't want to be in a relationship with me because i've got

01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:36.600
these photos out in the world but i wouldn't want to be in a relationship with a man like that anyway

01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:39.960
if he's going to judge me sort of thing and the problem with that is that if you actually look

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:45.560
at research on men it's like that's basically all men they might not say it because it's not

01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:50.440
really socially acceptable to admit to but actually it is basically all men like to the point that

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:57.800
if a man isn't bothered i'd wonder if he had a cuckold fetish you know and then and then that

01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:01.800
like obviously brings complications to your relationship what did you learn about porn

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:11.480
when you looked at that for the book i mean the thing with porn that i think a lot of people don't

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:19.400
fully appreciate is that online porn is a completely different beast from like playboy

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:23.880
of the 60s i mean i start the book by writing about playboy writing like you have no and clearly

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:30.360
like there were feminist writing at the time about porn being really grim for women there's

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:35.880
this famous cover of an issue of hustler i can't remember what year it was published in probably

01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:42.600
the 70s where a woman is being like um ground up in a meat grinder and her legs are just

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:48.040
sticking out the top it's really like of like deliberately grotesque image and feminist got

01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:54.440
so upset about it at the time i think rightly but like they had no idea what would happen

01:05:54.440 --> 01:06:03.240
with the internet and i think that the thing that's so sinister about online porn is that

01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:11.240
there's this there's this quote i use in the book that the nature of like

01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:17.400
technical capitalism is that we are all either above the algorithm or below the algorithm we're

01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:24.200
writing these we're either creating these these these pieces of tech or we're being influenced

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:28.760
by them because we're using them or we're you know sexually interacting with people who are

01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:34.280
using them and porn is such an amazing example of this because it's just profit driven that's the

01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:39.080
point of it it's not it's not interested in the well-being of its consumers i mean whatever

01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:46.040
like porn have have various like advertising efforts to try and sanitize what they do but

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:53.640
the whole the whole point of it is making money and they're really good at it and the way that

01:06:53.640 --> 01:07:02.440
they do it is by basically creating a super stimulus which adults uses brains and the like

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:09.160
they're incredibly adept at basically arousing the human body the human animal like we can't

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:14.600
really resist our animal instincts as quickly as possible so you log on to one of these platforms

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:19.960
and you look at the front page and like everything is designed to make you as horny as possible as

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:30.120
quickly as possible and the the way the platforms are designed is to like introduce you to the

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:33.960
super stimulus and then introduce it to something even more stimulating and even more stimulating

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:39.000
even more stimulating and so you end up and i mean so a lot of people are able to use porn

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:43.240
casually quite a lot of people don't use it at all like a surprising including men surprising

01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:48.040
proportion do you know how much that is so i read a survey that about a quarter of millennial men

01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:57.640
haven't used it in the last month which quite a lot but the the there's a minority of users

01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:04.200
who are like helpless power users yeah yeah like again it's a burrito is a play as well like there

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:09.720
is a small number of men who watch i can't remember the cut the the figure i quote in the book it's

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:14.600
something like two percent of users use it for like seven hours a week or more it's a lot of porn

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:21.560
do you know um mary harrington's law of fap entropy yes whatever you start out wanking to

01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:25.400
will get progressively more disgusting over time and you'll be down in the depths of blueberry

01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:32.920
porn before you know it well yeah absolutely yeah i mean like just anecdotally there are some

01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:39.880
very strange things that compulsory porn users end up being turned on by and like to the point

01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:45.160
where they they can't even let erectile dysfunction being a huge problem they can't actually have

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:50.360
sex with a real person what's the name for that it's not ground pounding what's it called it's

01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:55.640
it's called something oh death grip syndrome death ground pounding where the fuck did i pull

01:08:55.640 --> 01:09:02.920
that from yeah death more unpleasant i mean death grip syndrome isn't that nice either yeah and i

01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:08.440
write in the book about um cultural death grip syndrome which is where we've got an incredibly

01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:16.200
pornified public life you've got so much more like sex scenes on tv advertising billboards whatever

01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:22.120
i mean like sex scenes on tv have wrapped up so quickly just in my lifetime that used to be edgy

01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:28.840
and now it's like you know every drama has to have like super super explicit sex scenes every five

01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:33.240
minutes whatever so you've got that on the one hand well i don't think we've ever had this much

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:38.120
explicit sex in public life but then also people aren't actually having sex you have the sex recession

01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:43.480
with sex depression where you've got as you were saying you've got loads of men who are virgins

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:49.800
up into their 20s and so on it's this really weird um what's the word

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:56.280
this is this really weird contradiction and it's one that the feminists of the 70s who were so upset

01:09:56.280 --> 01:10:02.200
about porn didn't foresee interestingly like they were concerned that porn would inspire sexual

01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:08.600
violence and like it's complicated because it probably does a bit like in some circumstances so

01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:16.440
for instance choking porn has become so popular and is so mainstream in a way that it wasn't at

01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:21.320
all 20 years ago it used to be considered a really niche media sim thing and even actually in the

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:28.600
BSN community was considered a bit risky whereas now like survey data is crazy for millennials and

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:33.720
younger the proportion of young women who report being choked by their partners um sometimes asking

01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:39.160
for it and sometimes sometimes non-consensually but it's like just become insanely mainstream

01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:45.880
really quickly and the only mechanism that i can see for that is porn that it's it's inspiring a

01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:57.080
change in sexual culture so so sometimes yeah it's inspiring more aggressive behavior from its users

01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:04.920
but equally actually sometimes it's like basically nuturing users that they become

01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:09.080
actually incapable of having sex with real person and even becoming capable of being

01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:14.360
aroused by just normal porn because they're so they'd like they go they go down the rabbit hole

01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:21.880
Laura Pappentrum continues to yeah what do what do most modern feminists think about porn

01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:26.760
now then do they think that it's liberating women and allowing them to earn and sex work

01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:30.520
is real work it's complicated because i think that the

01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:36.840
like most liberal feminists and sex positive feminists would definitely think that there's

01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:42.760
nothing like inherently bad about porn and would absolutely defend the right of women to

01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:46.360
produce it and so on but i think that there's increasingly a view that actually it's not

01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:54.840
it's not great i did a um debate at the oxford union earlier this year and the the proposition

01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:59.080
was something like this house welcomes a new porn it was mostly about the new fans but ended

01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:02.440
up being about porn in general and i thought i'd be slaughtered because i thought that the

01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:06.840
you know the students were going to be so sex positive and so anti everything i had to say

01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:11.160
and actually i won surprisingly i had some quite aggressive questions from the floor

01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:17.720
but actually at the end um our side one why do i think that was because i think actually

01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:23.640
this generation i mean these 18 year olds right so they've or a bit older they they're the generation

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:30.280
who had porn like on their private computers on their phones from adolescence onwards i mean

01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:38.680
i'm 30 so i didn't actually have my own smartphone or whatever until teens and above but these are

01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:43.640
the kids who who had it from like adolescence and would would expect to be exposed to porn really

01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:52.200
young and it was really formative in their sexuality and i think that it's hard not

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:59.640
to not to recognize the like the downsides of that the thing that i see online i don't know a

01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:05.480
single guy that is pro porn guys are either neutral porn or anti porn like and the ones

01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:10.920
that are anti porn are vehement about it do they tend to be anti porn from like

01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:17.160
the ethical women stuff or because of the effect on them i can

01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:24.520
not from the effect on women's stuff no um i think that i i i actually think that the guys

01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:29.240
that are behaviorally addicted to porn or have got friends that do or are scared that they're

01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:36.120
going to become it i actually think in part that they see the women that are um a part of the porn

01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:41.560
machine as part of the oppressor i think that they think that they are creating the content which is

01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:48.760
causing me to yeah i have to fap three or four times a day and and feel disgusted with myself or

01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:53.000
waste time or you have this sort of super normal stimuli problem of not being able to get it up and

01:13:54.840 --> 01:14:00.840
yeah i mean it's another one of those things where everybody's losing you know it except the

01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:06.440
owners of mind geek they're fine yeah didn't one of those one of those went on a podcast a few years

01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:12.440
ago i remember hearing about how huge that mind geek empire is it's like more than 50% of all

01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:17.480
porn streaming on the internet goes through them remembering that porn is still the biggest

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:24.280
traffic source on the internet and they've got it's wild yeah i uh aren't they british

01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:29.880
basically known one of the guys british as well i'm sure no i'm canadian the guy who only fans is

01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:34.280
british yes yeah he's uh i was trying to get him on i was trying to bring him on because he seems

01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:38.680
like a very interesting guy and i was really fascinated by their attempted move away from

01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:44.520
explicit content it was obvious that they had i don't think that that came from altruistic means

01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:49.800
i think that that came from probably investor problems and shit to do with banks so chelsea

01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:57.160
ferguson if you know her she owns admiami.vip which is another version of only fans she was on only

01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:00.760
fans she found out that it was a problem she's a friend i've been friends with her for a very long

01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:05.080
time she was got a huge private snapchat she's been a stripper for a long time in newcastle

01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:09.880
and she was telling me that she had to go to germany germany was the only place that she could

01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:15.000
get a bank that would process payments when they found out what she was doing so the back end of

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:19.960
stuff i think that that was the the story about only fans wasn't that they were trying to clean

01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:24.120
up the image it's that they were probably having investor problems and and operational shit on

01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:29.800
the back end yeah interesting because that was one of the my memory of the timeline is that big

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:36.360
new york times piece about pawn hub and monkey came out and these are in particular possibly some

01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:44.040
other companies i can't remember got a cold feet and thinking that they were inadvertently funding

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:49.240
child rape images and so i guess that that i mean i mean only fans has loads of kids on it

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:55.240
realistically and i know that they try they say that they try to make sure that it's only adults

01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:59.480
but they can't realistically do that there are loads of stories anecdotally of girls

01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:06.040
you know 14 15 year old girls whatever putting their images up there it is inevitable on any of

01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:10.680
these platforms you can't really protect against it what do you mean when you say that people are

01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:17.880
not products so that's yeah that's the when i mentioned at the beginning that i had that

01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:24.920
big twitter storm about my uh about my chapter titles and that was kind of the most all these

01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:29.320
like left-wing sex positive people absolutely outraged at me saying that people aren't products

01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:33.960
i mean it comes back to the sexual disenchantment point that if you

01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:42.040
if you really think that sex is meaningless it's just like making coffee blah blah blah

01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:47.480
that people can just like sell sexual access to themselves like they'd sell any other kind of

01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:53.800
service or any other kind of product like it's internally consistent and it's the sort of

01:16:55.320 --> 01:17:00.520
the the phrase that i use in that chapter is that it's the logic of the punter i mean that's

01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:07.320
what punters think that they can just they don't really see prostitute women as being properly human

01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:11.880
i think i mean based on the way that they write about them that doesn't that doesn't seem to be

01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:19.080
how they view them there's like appalling review platforms online where punters will review

01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:24.280
women that they've bought sex from and there's like no human feeling in there like there's like

01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:30.120
true psychopathy on display so so like that probably is the only population who actually

01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:37.800
believe in sexual disenchantment um the women they're buying sex from certainly don't and

01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:46.840
and like thinking away from the more extreme end of it in terms of prostitution as well just

01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:54.680
thinking about things like dating apps which are also kind of designed like they're also sort of

01:17:54.680 --> 01:18:00.120
continuous with the logic of the punter in that they are designed to be like shopping apps that's

01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:05.240
how they feel you don't feel using them that different from using like asos or ebay or whatever

01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:11.320
because you swipe swipe swipe and select your product um i mean or not of course if you're like

01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:16.040
an incel who doesn't get any matches but for for for high status men and for women that is how it

01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:19.560
that's how it's experienced and it's got a really really consumerist kind of

01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:26.840
energy the cat the whole like casual sex phenomenon um which ought to be the sort of thing that the

01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:32.040
left are really opposed to you know my my my colleagues at the new statesman like this ought

01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:37.640
this ought to be you know we're talking about this multi-billion pound global empire of the

01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:41.880
porn industry we're talking about a really consumerist attitude towards other people's

01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:47.800
bodies and minds like this this this isn't conservative or it shouldn't be like this should be

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:53.960
101 anti-capitalist critique coming from the left but it isn't and i think that that's because

01:18:55.400 --> 01:19:03.640
a lot of people on the left have prioritized like owning the comms and are more interested

01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:09.960
in tearing down bourgeois sexual norms and basically promoting free love at all costs

01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:14.040
than they are in thinking about where this has actually led to a led us to and i think that this

01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:21.320
the last 60 70 years post sexual revolution period has been has been in a big experiment

01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:27.880
in what happens if you disconnect sex from reproduction and you basically discard all

01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:35.000
of the like quite finely tuned norms that used to exist basically to keep young horny people

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:39.720
away from each other i mean the way that this is interpret this history is interpreted by feminist

01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:45.720
often is is this all those social norms exist to control female sexuality and they did but they

01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:51.000
also exist to control male sexuality and the purpose of it wasn't to oppress women it wasn't

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:57.160
motivated by misogyny it was motivated by the fact that if sex leads to reproduction then that's

01:19:57.160 --> 01:20:02.280
everyone's concern like that that matters to the community because if you've got people

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:08.200
young couples producing illegitimate children like that's that matters to the family that matters

01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:15.160
to the community it it's it's essential in a world without contraception to control young

01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:20.520
people's sexuality and that's what those norms existed for and we threw them out the window

01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:27.400
very rapidly and we've basically seen this play out over the last however many decades and i think

01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:31.080
that the the results are in and they're not very promising

01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:38.120
that's really really good i i learned from mary when she came on the show

01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:44.840
about the fact that a lot of the rules and the norms that are set are by the elite and

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:50.520
they're usually not the ones that suffer the impact it's a luxury belief right yeah to hold

01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:55.400
that um men don't need to hold the door open for you and that having chivalry and constraints on

01:20:55.400 --> 01:21:02.680
male behavior that's not needed by some upper middle class woman whose husband has got a

01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:09.240
postgraduate degree because there are maybe levels of education or or norm enforcement

01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:13.240
that have occurred just through his upbringing and her upbringing that means that it doesn't matter

01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:19.400
what you don't think about is the the underclass or the working class guy and girl who perhaps

01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:24.920
haven't had those same sort of levels of norms enforced and maybe they don't know that not

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:29.240
hitting your wife is that big of a deal and then when the culture starts to erode and evaporate

01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:36.200
that away you go well but the people that made the rules or that encourage the norms to be dissolved

01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:41.080
and not the ones that are suffering they're dissolving yeah rob henson actually i think

01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:46.120
uses polyamory as his one of his examples as he and his his original luxury beliefs i say

01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:53.960
where if you're a high status person let's say in like the bay area where everyone else polyamory

01:21:54.760 --> 01:22:00.840
is really is just like cool and you can if it all falls in a heap it doesn't matter because you've

01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:05.960
got your money and your status and all of your stability to fall back on and everyone will just

01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:11.320
sort of think that you're a bit behemian whereas if you're a working class underclass woman who's

01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:16.360
basically you know living polyamory like having lots of different partners and lots of different

01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:22.760
children by them people one will think you're trash but two like your life becomes so challenging

01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:27.720
because you've got you've got all these children to look after and you don't have the reliable

01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:34.760
support of a partner and like you're at risk of absolutely everything falling apart but but this

01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:39.960
is but yeah it is a luxury belief in the sense that saying that that's a good thing and and and

01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:49.880
resisting the um resisting the traditional norms that used to that used to exist gives status to

01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:57.160
rich people well think about i i i really like the idea that um beating the other side was more

01:22:57.160 --> 01:23:02.040
important than raising up the people of your political party and i think that that's very true

01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:09.720
there was a study that i saw around about 2012 surveys of democrats and republicans the um

01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:15.800
proportions twisted and they they flipped from i vote for my party because i like my party to

01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:21.160
i vote for my party because i dislike the other party pretty much more people were doing protest

01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:27.320
votes because of a hatred of the other rather than a love of the similar yeah you go well

01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:32.760
how easily is that to be weaponized you know and how how many perverse incentives are you

01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:38.680
going to create there you mentioned at the beginning about um how my book will be received in america

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:46.360
and um not all but a lot of the a lot of my friends who are also writing on similar things

01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:54.040
like mary and nina and so on are british and british feminism is much more it's much more

01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:59.800
permissible to say this stuff than it is in the states in general and i think the reason for that

01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:06.280
is that we don't really have a christian right in the uk so there isn't really any like fearsome

01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:11.480
enemy that we all need to be focused against and things like abortion rights are rock solid pretty

01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:18.440
much like not in ireland but in the mainland uk um like that doesn't feel under threat and

01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:24.360
i think that's what it is that because i think american feminism is just so focused all the time

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:29.320
on like often shadow boxing against the christian right in the sense that i think they overstate

01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:33.000
their influence in their power and there's and they're kind of stuck in the past a little bit

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:39.240
and there's this like underdog mentality that we things like constantly having to reassert like oh

01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:43.960
you shouldn't be ashamed of sex you should be you know it's like we've won that fight come on

01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:49.800
i think it's like look at any any newspaper magazine tv channel whatever like the idea

01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:55.000
that women are not allowed to say they enjoy sex it's like 50 years out of date come on so they're

01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:03.160
so focused on a like somewhat imaginary enemy that they can't actually interrogate the coherence

01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:08.920
of their own views whereas they think in the uk that isn't that isn't so much the case at all

01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:15.800
and actually there's a lot more things like trans politics or whatever which we haven't

01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:21.960
gone into in in this discussion but is is much more cross-party is not there isn't this like

01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:29.000
really fierce dichotomy politically which i think gives more space for thinking critically

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:34.920
like i i feel like i can write this book and i'm not going to get pegged as a crazy conservative

01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:41.160
i might be wrong about that we'll wait and see how should people act then given all of this

01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:47.400
everything that we've gone through how should people act so i mean i i i do basically make the

01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:53.800
case in the book for for for being a bit more old-fashioned on some stuff like i a lot of a

01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:59.320
lot of that section of it is directed more at women than at men so like i think for instance

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:03.720
it's a good idea for women not to have sex on the first date or not even to have sex in the first

01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:09.240
three months because that that gives you the opportunity to assess whether or not he considers

01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:16.920
you to be good time only or if your wife material stuff like that which like you could basically

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:25.160
read in most agony answer from like the 1950s which is obviously what i get accused of in my

01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:30.040
reviews um but also they like there was there was a reason for it it wasn't it wasn't motivated by

01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:36.040
misogyny you know there was a there was like a proper principle behind it um i mean similarly for

01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:39.880
men i i mean i don't know what i don't know what advice i have to offer fit in the cells to be honest

01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:44.680
i think i'm probably not the right person to offer any kind of advice because

01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:51.480
typically they don't like advice in any case no from like a fish teaching a fisherman how to fish

01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:57.560
type thing yeah it just it goes down badly i had a nama kates on um a couple of months maybe six

01:26:57.560 --> 01:27:01.400
months ago and she's done tons of work tons of research like first hand research into it

01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:06.120
a lot of people were unhappy about the fact that she wasn't someone that could understand their

01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:11.400
plight um so okay so for women don't have sex on the first date not having sex for three months

01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:16.280
so there's an interesting uh insight i learned from jeffrey miller evolutionary psychologist so

01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:20.040
his book mate that he wrote with tucker max which should have been so much bigger than it was

01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:24.360
it's such a shame that it didn't do like mental numbers because it's great he explained about

01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:30.920
how um slut shaming is a sort of game theoretic enforcement mechanism to ensure that the price

01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:36.040
of sex doesn't descend lower than women want it to which is why most women are the enforcers of

01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:41.160
slut shaming not men men actually have an incentive for slut shaming to go away um yeah

01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:49.800
but one of the problems that you have here is you can kind of see ease of sex or or or speed

01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:56.760
towards um being accepting of having sex with a potential new partner as kind of being a price

01:27:56.760 --> 01:28:00.920
right and as you start to extend that out the price that the man has to pay continues to go up

01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:06.040
and up and up so you really do need a bit of a god's eye view because if every woman tomorrow said

01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:10.440
right no sex until three months that's fine that's the playing field maybe you would have more men

01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:14.040
that would sort of duck out of the dating game but over time they would acclimatize right because

01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:20.600
we acclimatize to no sex before marriage that was there so yeah i think okay so what else what

01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:27.400
else can people do i mean yeah so on that point about um yeah i mean strike breakers

01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:34.840
really for everyone else the i think that one of the things i hope comes from the book is that

01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:40.040
a lot of young women in particular because they've not yet learned through life experience are

01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:44.680
phenomenally ignorant about the reality of male sexuality and the reality of sexual difference

01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:50.840
and so don't realize for instance some of what we've spoken about the fact that like um the sexual

01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:57.640
double standard is alive and well and um a lot of like men can have a motion of sex in a way that

01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:03.080
women can't and all of this and so we'll interpret for instance um

01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:09.400
though they will misinterpret a lot of male behavior and end up making decisions that

01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:12.920
actually not in their best interest because they they think that you know the guy who wants to sleep

01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:19.080
with them must want something more from them afterwards and then and then i like you know

01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:25.720
learn the hard way that that's not true and i think that actually if if there was more

01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:33.080
knowledge widespread knowledge about the existence of these facts i think actually that

01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:37.480
young women's behavior could change quite quickly because at the moment for instance the

01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:43.560
like you go on tiktok or whatever and you get young women will do things like show off their

01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:47.800
bruises that they've got from having rough sex with men who like obviously hate them

01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:52.360
but they're a it's a status symbol because it's a sign of being oh look i'm so attractive i mean

01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:58.360
particularly things like choking a lot of women interpret choking as being a sign of like passionate

01:29:58.360 --> 01:30:03.720
love like in like a 50 shades of gray way like i want you so much i'll do anything to have you

01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:08.760
is the way that this is like interpreted in the romantic imagination that's not generally have

01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:14.200
the men who are doing it interpret it at all so there's this like mutual miscomprehension

01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:18.840
where each sex is doing something they actually don't like realize how the other side is interpreting

01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:23.480
it i think if more women realized that it would it would no longer be high status to be showing

01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:28.440
off your bruises on tiktok because actually the like the truth of it is that basically any

01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:33.800
moderately good-looking young women can get as many partners as she wants and can get them to do

01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:42.280
you know if she if if she asks them to choke her they will it's not a sign of being super attractive

01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:48.360
but it's misinterpreted as being as such so i think that if there were more

01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:53.400
i think there was a better understanding than some of the incentives would change

01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:56.520
which would be a good thing for young women

01:30:57.480 --> 01:31:04.760
louise perry ladies and gentlemen i really really enjoyed the book i think that the group of women

01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:10.040
that we've got in the uk you mary nina we need to come up with a new net this can be a public

01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:15.480
service announcement to the people that are still listening um before we started we came up with the

01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:22.120
name of based british women but then realized that the acronym of bbw can be problematic

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:28.120
so if you've got an alternative that the girls can use that would be great um but yeah i i think

01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:32.360
that it's really great i'd i really really like all of the work that you guys have put out um

01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:35.000
where should people go they want to read more of your stuff online where should they go

01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:40.280
so there's a book obviously which is out already in the uk the case against sexual
