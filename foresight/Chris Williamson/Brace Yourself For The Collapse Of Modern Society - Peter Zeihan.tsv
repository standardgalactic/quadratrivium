0	6560	Best guess is that China only has 1.3 billion people now the population probably peaked more than 10 years ago
6560	13600	And by 2030 there will be more retirees than workers and by 2050 the entire population of China will have dropped below
14240	15320	650 million
15320	18040	That's wild. It's beyond terminal
20200	27520	How real has the progress and prosperity of the last century been in your opinion? Oh, it's been fantastic
27520	33300	This has been the greatest time to be alive the combination of the American security umbrella plus globalization
33920	39080	Has changed the way we lived. It's allowed everyone to benefit from global trade
39960	42480	Before we had that if you didn't have oil locally
42480	47520	You didn't have transport fuel if you didn't have coal locally you didn't have electricity if you didn't have good food
48000	50000	Locally you didn't have a population
50840	55440	globalization safe globalization enabled anyone to trade anything that they could produce
55840	61960	Even if it wasn't a commodity and join the system. It was like everyone had one World War two all at once
62360	64360	It's it's been a great ride
64720	66720	And now it's ending
66960	73100	Was it inevitable that it was going to end if you'd gone back a century ago and being able to change
73840	78280	Policy globally could you have done something differently back then?
79320	82760	A century ago probably not there's a there's a couple problems here
82760	85400	So first of all when globalization really got going in the 50s
85600	91560	We started moving off the farms and into the cities to take manufacturing jobs now when you live
92200	95840	On a farm kids are free labor. You have a whole scat of them
96320	103800	But when you move into a condo kids are just really loud expensive mobile pieces of furniture and adults aren't idiots
103800	108160	So we had fewer you play that forward for 70 years
108600	112680	And it's not that we're running out of children that happened 40 years ago
112680	114680	It's that we're running out of mature adults
114680	120400	And so the economic model of globalization is consumption based and it just doesn't work without people
120600	124160	So we've always known we were going to get here in the end just happen
124160	127560	The Americans forced the issue at the end of the war
127560	134400	We told everyone that we would patrol the global ocean so that anyone could send any cargo ship anywhere to trade in any product with any partner
134840	139000	That's what made globalization work now. We didn't do this because we were nice
139000	142040	We didn't do this because it was a trade program. We did this as a bribe
142480	146680	This is what we gave everyone so that they would join us against the Soviets
147720	149720	Soviet Union collapsed in 1992
149920	154760	So Americans have been electing ever more isolationist and populist leaders ever since
155280	162760	So for you to believe that globalization can continue you have to believe that a it doesn't require consumption anymore and
163280	167400	Be that the Americans will continue to bleed and die so that the Chinese can get
168240	170240	You know, that's a bad bad
172120	175440	Before we start talking about where we're at and what that means for the future
175440	181480	Is there anything else that we need to understand about how we got here about any of the fundamental principles that we're going to be talking about?
182280	183720	We'll bring them up as we go
183720	190000	But those are the two big things the demographic flip well past the point of no return and the Americans have largely checked out
190720	197760	You said that 2019 is the best that the world will ever be what was particularly special about that one year
198440	204960	so think of your demographic profile as a pyramid children on the bottom retirees at the top
205360	208140	mortality built it into a pyramid as we
209360	216240	industrialized and urbanized it became more of a column and then and eventually an inverted V with more mature adults than children in
217120	223200	2019 was the last year before the baby boomers really got into retirement in a big way
223520	229960	So we had this massive post-war generation throughout the Western world that were all on average
231400	233000	63
233000	234240	so
234240	242600	They hadn't retired yet and all of their investments and all the retirement savings were churning along providing capital for the whole system
242680	250080	We still had a huge amount of consumption out in the world, but you fast-forward three years this year on average they turn 66
251480	257280	So it's over we've lost their consumption. We lose their investment
257280	263080	They have to liquidate all their stocks and bonds and go into T bills and cash because they won't have the ability to recover from a crash
263720	269000	and we're also seeing some of the fastest demographic aging in human history throughout the
269360	275000	Developing world with China being the far most advanced. So we're losing the investors. We're losing the workers
275000	277000	We're losing the consumers all at the same time
277160	281760	On top of that we had Trump and we had COVID and now we've got Biden
281760	288280	And then we had Brexit and everything that used to tie it all together has been broken apart either on purpose or just because of the
288280	291240	Strategic trends that were already in play. We're never going back
292080	293240	consumers
293280	300400	Investors and workers those are the three main things that people of working age and above school age give us
301120	305640	Absolutely, and we're running out of all of them and you need those to continue to grease the system
305640	312320	They're the people that drive not only creativity in terms of pushing technological progress forward and bits and pieces
312320	317520	But they also inject capital into the system. They're the ones that are spending on consumer goods so on and so forth
317520	321640	so they just provide lubricate like financial lubrication and also the
323240	326160	Worker power the employee employee power, right?
326160	332400	You can kind of split it into two general categories for people roughly aged 18 to 40 maybe 45
332400	335480	Those are your young workers relatively low value add
336400	341440	Relatively low cost, but they're at the height of their consumption because they're raising kids and buying homes
341440	344760	So that's where most of the economic activity that drives a modern system comes from
345200	350760	Once you passed 45 up until 65 the kids are moving out the house has been paid down
350760	356560	But your income keeps going up so the delta between your income and your expenses gets very very large
356560	359120	And that's where all the financial heft comes from
359200	365840	but these are also our most productive workers because they literally have decades of experience and from roughly
366720	367920	1985 until
367920	374640	2015 the world was in kind of the perfect balance because we had a lot of those countries with the mature worker
374800	378920	Demographics and then a lot with the younger worker demographics
379280	385480	What's happened is that countries who joined globalization in the second wave in 1990s mostly the developing world
385880	390360	They urbanized and aged out much faster than the rich world did
390880	392880	So when we hit 2015
394080	399800	That big chunk of developing world workers the experienced workers the productive workers the ones who saved
400640	403760	They're now moving into retirement. We're losing their money. We're losing their skills
404720	409360	But because the developing world is aging so much faster
410160	416320	They're moving into their 40s in their 50s, but they haven't been able to build up the skill set because their systems were not as established
417320	420280	But their birth rates dropped faster than the West's did
420600	424920	So they actually have lower birth rates in many cases in most of the advanced world
425160	430720	So we've lost children on both sides of the ledger and now our new mature workers
430760	434480	Just don't have the skill set to keep it up. And even if they did they wouldn't have anyone to sell to
435000	440600	When old people die, do they not pass their money down as either inheritance or inheritance tax?
440600	446660	Does that not go back into the system in one way? They do and if they died at age 66, that would be great from an economic
449240	451240	Unfortunately, if that's the right word
452040	457880	This people continue on for 20 25 years after retirement now. This is gonna sound really weird
457880	459880	But in the United States, this is less of a problem
460480	466000	Number one, our baby boomers actually had kids. So we do have a replacement generation. We know them as millennials
466640	470760	We can talk about them later in all their faults, but ultimately they're there and that's a good thing
472520	474520	Second
474520	478600	We have a really high mortality rate among people over age 55 in the United States
479120	484840	The the delta between the average age of mortality in Europe versus the United States is in excess of 10 years
485200	489040	So we will get that churn a lot faster than Europe will
489920	491920	That's interesting
491920	493640	okay, so
493640	500120	What which countries at the moment have got the worst demographics which countries should be yeah
500120	503360	Which countries should be very concerned about the ratio of young to old?
504240	506240	The worst in the world is China
506600	512440	They've been in the process of updating their data over the course of the last couple years and they're now starting to publicly admit
512440	514440	That they over counted by a hundred million people
514720	519720	All of those people would have been born since one child so age 40 and under the young worker demographic that
519920	523520	Childbearing demographic and two-thirds of them are probably women
523920	528960	So we best guess is that China only has 1.3 billion people now
529640	534320	The population probably peaked more than 10 years ago and by 2030
534560	542280	There will be more retirees than workers and by 2050 the entire population of China will have dropped below 650 million
544040	549600	That's wild it's beyond terminal yeah, so the Chinese system collapses this decade for sure
550600	552600	I
552840	557700	Assuming nothing else goes wrong, and there's plenty other competitors to put the bullet in China's head
558560	561520	Dude, that is crazy. Okay, so
562680	567760	Yeah, all the way from pre-industrial to post-industrial collapse in 45 years
570800	578680	Just for the people that don't understand about how the one-child policy and the preference for boys over girls and stuff created this landscape
578680	581280	What's the what's the high-level view of that sure? Well, there's two things
581880	588640	First of all of course is one child Mao was concerned that they had a young upcoming generation after World War II that was going to eat the country alive
589440	595480	So they went to a two-child policy ultimately to a one-child policy, and that was not loosened until 2015
595480	599360	But by that point the damage was already done because there was a second factor
600400	606560	Remember countries that industrialized later can follow the path of those who came before they can skip some steps
606880	611400	So China was the fastest ever industrialization experience
612360	616480	What the United Kingdom did in seven generations the Chinese did in one?
616480	622720	And so they crammed seven generations of economic growth and development into one and that's why their growth rate has been so impressive
622720	629720	But you can only do that once and now it's behind them and now they have no children and they have very few people under age 45
630720	632720	Mmm
632720	634720	Is this is
635040	641720	Population growth and collapse similar to an r-naught number in a way that more people
642080	645520	Allow you to have more children which gives you more people to have more children
645520	648520	But if the reverse is happening then it causes a nose dive
650000	652720	You're absolutely right there now. I don't want to say that
653400	657960	Unchecked population growth is necessarily the way to go. That's not what I'm after here
657960	662520	I mean you require a balance between children young workers and mature workers
662520	664680	If you don't have enough mature workers, you don't have the capital
664680	668160	You don't have enough young workers. You don't have the consumption. You don't have the children. You don't have a future
668800	674560	China is already out of those last two categories. And so we know where this leads. It leads to zero
676120	677640	Given the fact that
677640	683360	Humans are being I think it's every three generations lives for another generation at the moment around about every generation lives eight years
683600	687720	Longer than the generation before increased health care health span
688520	696520	Better access to that is only true in the shift from pre-industrial to industrial so you get that once
697560	702680	Well depends upon how you apply the lessons to your system in the case of Europe. I'd say they got it three times
703640	709360	But there's definitely an upper limit one of the things to keep in mind especially when you're talking about European demographics
709360	712240	Is that Europe in Europe people are not living longer?
713480	719000	Overall lifespan has not improved. What's improved is we've gotten rid of a lot of mortality
719200	724400	So the things that used to kill you when you were zero to sixty five don't kill you anymore
725960	727320	Right, okay
727320	730280	That is going to change the shape of demographics as well
730280	736280	Right the fact that young people are able to get old more easily say more safely more safely
736280	740520	Yeah, precisely, so I guess there's just a lot over the last hundred years. We've seen such change
740520	744440	It's not just been technological change, but downstream from that is what's happened
745000	751080	Demographically and how that's how that's influenced the demography. Okay, so if I'm medicine electricity sewage
751160	757560	Yeah, if China's got the worst who what are some of the areas that have got better-looking demography
758320	765520	The three countries in the world in the in the advanced world actually in the advanced and in the developing world
766840	768840	New Zealand France United States
769040	773300	And largely for the same reason there are countries that have a little bit more physical space
774200	776280	So their cities tend to be more of a sprawl
776520	782320	You're more likely to have a backyard more people can live in the countryside and be economically viable
782320	785840	So when these three countries urbanized they did it at a slower rate
785840	791000	And they remain the three advanced countries with the lowest urbanization rates in the world
791600	798480	In the advanced developing world the closest one was is going to be Mexico and for similar reasons
799840	805320	I'm in central Mexico, which is on a highland massive is just one giant suburban sprawl
805640	811640	And that means that people can have more children now all of these countries still have their own demographic hiccups
811640	815880	They all have the baby boomer problem. It's just that they all have replacement generations
816720	822200	I saw I had a conversation with Jordan Peterson about this at the start of the year and I did some research before is the
822760	824760	country with the highest
824960	826960	current birth rate per
827320	834720	Family Chad be somewhere in Africa. I'm gonna guess probably somewhere in central Africa. Yeah Chad, Nigeria that cluster
835080	842320	But I'm gonna guess that just lots of children isn't necessarily a good answer either because you then lock yourself into potential futures
842320	849760	You can't birth any more or fewer five-year-olds now. It's what whatever happens this year is now. Yeah, yeah, precisely
849760	855800	Precisely, so in the case of sub-Saharan Africa, and you know, this is a very broad array of countries
855840	857840	It's very difficult to make a generalization
858160	865880	They've started to industrialize and so they're going down the same path that everybody else did and the first step of that path is
865880	871000	lowering infant and child mortality and so when one out of three children don't die
872000	874320	You have an explosion in your birth rate
874320	876320	But if you play that forward 10 15 years
876360	881600	Then you start having adjustments and family planning and you get smaller and smaller families as urbanization kicks in
882120	886920	The danger for countries that are in this category who've taken the first but not the second step is
887840	891200	That they've imported a lot of the technologies of industrialization
891760	896440	Which has helped them out, but they have not developed the systems to sustain that
897400	902740	Themselves so if something happens to the outside environment, they lose all of the benefits what like
904120	906120	Healthcare medicines
906280	907560	fertilizers
907560	912480	It's very easy for me to see a lot of these countries facing famine in the not too distant future
912880	918160	Because if you break down globalization, you know, yes, that means it's difficult to get oil or manufactured goods
918160	920160	I'm more concerned about agriculture
921040	923040	Agriculture is by far the most
923040	928240	Delicate and vulnerable of the economic sectors because it needs the equipment it needs the finance and needs the fertilizers
928240	932080	It needs the trade options you break any of those the whole system falls apart
933080	940360	And with the Ukraine war we are seeing massive disruptions to the fertilizer sector with some of the decisions the Chinese have made same thing
940640	943480	So we're already looking this year at losing
944560	950200	Roughly a third of global fertilizer supply. That is going to haunt us for a decade
950720	952080	Wow, okay
952080	958080	so for the people that maybe haven't been able to work out why it is that increasing urbanization and
958800	964600	Education and development causes a reduction in birth rate. Can you just explain that for sure?
964880	966640	It's a wide array of factors
966640	971640	So when you move into a city you have less room and that just changes the mechanics of raising kids
972160	978680	When you move off the farm kids are no longer free labor. You have fewer of them when you urbanize when you have electricity
979560	984280	You've generated time and so people can do things after sunset
984840	989720	This is important for everything in terms of economic development, but it's most important for women
990200	995040	Because if a woman moves off the farm into the city and all of a sudden can do something after hours
995440	1000080	You have the opportunity for mass education and freeing them from doing more than just being mothers
1000080	1001320	Nothing wrong with being a mother
1001320	1005120	But it's a full-time job on the farm in the city
1005120	1010560	You're gonna have fewer kids that's less time allotted and you have a greater chance to you know read
1010600	1017080	And so the entire women's right movement is basically linked indelibly to electricity and
1017960	1023800	Once you have it women have fewer kids because they now have other things going on in their lives that compete for attention
1024440	1030160	They can go and get jobs. They can pursue careers. They can do research. Yes interest
1030160	1035040	We absolutely so I mean the the British example with the the cotton mills was probably the best example
1035320	1041600	The first group of people to urbanize weren't the men. It was the women and we saw the impact on birth grades
1042320	1046400	Going back to what you said there about food shortages and the delicacy of agriculture
1046400	1053240	I'm seeing a lot of videos come out shaky phone videos come out of China at the moment. Just how bad is there any
1054080	1058600	Reliable information about how bad food and the future of food will be in China
1058960	1063000	It's getting difficult to get good information out of China. It's really demand
1063560	1067720	Devolved into a cult of personality state even stricter than what Mao Zedong had
1068200	1074000	I don't think that the Chinese having a food crisis that is impacting their ability to have calories at the moment
1075440	1077440	Chinese land is among the worst in the world
1077440	1082280	And so it requires a huge amount of fertilizer to grow anything specifically phosphate for rice
1082760	1086040	By far the world's most phosphate hungry crop in the Chinese traditionally
1086360	1089280	Because of that have been the world's largest producer and exporter of the stuff
1089760	1095240	The problem is actually with Africans swine fever. Now, you may have heard of that a few years ago
1095240	1101240	They had a big outbreak. They ended up culling more hogs from their farms and the rest of the world's commercial
1101640	1103640	farms have hogs
1103720	1107880	Just give you an idea of just how lopsided the pork market is. It's two-thirds of it is China
1108920	1114840	They went to rebuild their herds, but they never abrogated the debts for the farmers who went out of business
1115160	1118480	They just offered subsidies to bring in new people. They thought that would be cheaper
1119000	1123800	Well, you have now two million new hog farmers in China who have no idea what they're doing
1123800	1126840	And let's just say that phyto sanitary does not
1127520	1134200	Translate into Mandarin well in the first place. So we're probably in the early stages of a second wave of ASF
1134200	1137400	That'll probably be just as bad if not worse than the first one
1137480	1143000	So pork just like it did two or three years ago is about to fall off the market in China completely
1144080	1146080	That just leaves rice
1146080	1151600	So the Chinese have banned the export of phosphate fertilizer in the short term
1151600	1158120	This is causing massive problems in agricultural producers in East and South Asia Australia, especially Western Australia is probably the part
1158120	1160120	That's getting gotten hit hardest
1160120	1165360	Brazil is feeling the impacts because these are Western Australia and Brazil basically can't grow without fertilizer
1165360	1168640	They don't have soil on the way that we think at the term. It's a weird geology
1170720	1174900	But you interrupt the input flows
1176080	1178960	And it's very difficult to grow food at volume
1179680	1185120	And China in the best of times is on a razor's edge in terms of food sustainability
1185200	1193040	And they use about three to six times as much fertilizer as is used in the global average just because their land is so poor
1195360	1197360	Luckily phosphate they've got covered
1198000	1202080	They produce that themselves, but the nitrogen is all made with imported natural gas
1202880	1204560	and the uh
1204560	1208240	The phosphate half of i'm sorry the potash half of that comes from a different continent
1209200	1210080	so
1210080	1212080	Yeah, china demographic collapse
1212720	1214160	unavoidable
1214160	1215360	food collapse
1215360	1217120	highly likely
1217120	1220240	And that's before you start talking about things like energy manufacturing and trade
1220880	1224160	Does this not make china unbelievably dangerous?
1225680	1229440	The question is what would you do if you're china? Where would you go to get what you want?
1230240	1232880	If you go into kazakhstan fine, but you know, what does the winner get?
1233840	1235600	You can't go to india
1235600	1237040	Nabila is on the way
1237040	1243360	You could go into vietnam, but when the vietnamese when the um, sorry when the chinese did that last in 1979
1243360	1247120	They got treated just as well as the americans were and so that was a quick war
1247680	1249680	They don't have the navy to push out
1250720	1257200	Japan and taiwan could go nuclear in a month. Hang on that just leaves russia. We heard this
1258560	1260400	China are taking over the south china sea
1260480	1266640	There's all of these small islandettes that they're putting together. They've got this scary big armed
1268000	1271040	Forces that's going to come and take over everything in the is that not the case
1271040	1275200	So they're not as strong militarily as they have been have we been told really not
1275520	1278800	Um, they have made significant strides over the last 30 years
1278880	1280400	I don't mean to belittle that
1280400	1285520	But everything they're doing in the south china sea was designed to intimidate vietnam and the philippines into
1285600	1290320	Cowering and it had the opposite effect and both countries just ran to japan and now have defense packs
1291360	1294960	It doesn't really allow the the chinese to project power very far either
1295680	1298640	They do have a lot of ships. They've got like a 650 ship navy
1299120	1305360	But 90 of them are really small and can't sail more than 1500 kilometers from the coast
1305920	1308880	And that assumes they're going slow in a straight line and no one's shooting at them
1309280	1313200	In actual combat conditions. They can maybe make it 600k
1314160	1316480	So it's they don't have the power projection
1317440	1322560	And they're the country in the world that is most dependent on reaching the world in order to reach markets
1323120	1324880	and resources
1324880	1328960	Okay, so that's demographics. How does globalization play a role?
1329760	1331200	well
1331200	1335840	If the chinese can't reach europe, they lose their largest market if the united states throws a trade war
1335920	1340720	They lose their second largest market if they can't reach africa. They lose raw material resources
1340800	1343200	If they can't reach the persian golf the lights go out
1343920	1350480	They're completely dependent on globalization as maintained by the americans for the entirety of their economic and cultural system
1350800	1353120	What do you mean when you say as maintained by the americans?
1353680	1358560	The united states is the country that guarantees freedom of the seas or traditionally that has been our role since world war two
1358720	1360720	That's what we're getting out of
1361200	1364960	And we're there's going to be this little fun thing with ukraine war that's about to happen
1365440	1369680	So i don't know how much you've been following that but the europeans have done an insurance ban
1370480	1374720	Which has dissuaded most reputable carriers from taking russian crew to china
1375120	1377920	So the chinese and the russians rented a bunch of super tankers
1378160	1381120	Alashed them together into a raft off the coast of portugal
1381440	1388400	And they're bringing shuttle tankers from russia's ports, which can't take super tankers and doing sea to sea transfers in the middle of the atlantic
1389200	1391680	I can't wait for somebody just to do
1393040	1395040	And just grab it
1395040	1400000	It could be portugal the chinese don't have the naval capacity to put anything that far out neither to the russians
1400320	1405280	But someone soon is going to do that and that's going to shut down the entire energy trade out of russia
1405680	1409520	I'm a little surprised it hasn't happened already, but it's going to be a fun day when it does go down
1410000	1415600	Dude, that's wild. I mean how much how much oil are you talking about here? Because presumably if someone was going to
1416320	1420800	Do a small act of war in order to take it it would have to be a worthwhile amount of
1421520	1425200	Well, you wouldn't you probably wouldn't do it just because you wanted the oil
1425200	1429200	You would do it because you want to disrupt the russian financial system because this would destroy it
1430080	1434880	One super tanker the insurance policy on one super tanker is going to run about a billion dollars
1435440	1438400	The russians only have five billion dollars put aside for this
1438960	1444000	So not only would you disrupt the immediate transfer, which probably would affect
1444880	1449360	I'm just spitballing here because the russians aren't talking but let's call it two to three million barrels immediately
1449680	1454720	But anything else that was in the chain going back to the russian ports probably another 10 or 15
1456160	1458960	Million, I'm sorry. I said billion early two to three
1459600	1465440	Million barrels. There's probably another 10 to 15 million barrels on shuttle tankers on their way there now
1466080	1469600	And then all of a sudden the ports get clogged and then the pipes get clogged
1469920	1473440	And the pressure builds up into Siberia into the permafrost and the wells freeze
1474000	1476080	And that's it for russian energy for 30 years
1476960	1478960	Dude everything is so interconnected
1479680	1481680	Mm-hmm and fragile
1482960	1488880	Okay, so that's globalization for china you mentioned that the us was kind of like the police of the sea
1489520	1492880	And they're getting out of it. What does getting out of it mean and what did police of the sea mean?
1493520	1500000	Well part of globalization was making sure that everybody's commerce could go anywhere in the pre-world war two environment
1500080	1503280	Unless you were an empire with a navy you didn't trade
1503840	1505840	You couldn't because the empires were in charge
1507280	1511840	When the empires died in world war two and the americans took over the global structures
1512800	1517840	We decided that rather than having a single american-led structure that was designed to siphon off
1518240	1523760	energy and food and resources and money to the united states as an empire would we would instead
1524560	1531440	Prioritize security versus the soviets and so we provided the economic backdrop the security backdrop
1531680	1533680	That was necessary for everyone to play
1534320	1539280	And that's the world we know that's what we've been living in the americans make sure that piracy is under control
1539280	1544240	They make sure that hostile countries can't rage commerce and they generally provide policing actions
1545440	1550400	Not to say that we've done it great in any given day, but that that's been the plan and it's broadly worked
1551600	1556400	Since 1992 we've been backing away from that. We've been closing down our overseas bases
1556560	1561600	We've been retooling our military so it's not destroyer heavy and designed to patrol
1561920	1565760	It's carrier heavy and decide to and design to hammer things
1566400	1570080	So we now have 11 super carriers by the end of this decade. We'll have 14
1570880	1572400	one of them
1572400	1576800	Is more powerful than all but nine of the air forces on the planet
1577840	1582640	And that assumes a fair fight and the whole idea of a navy is it's never a fair fight?
1583280	1586720	Because chips move, you know, we learned this from you
1587520	1592080	Uh, and so it's really one of our new super carriers can take on any but one of three
1592640	1595280	Air forces in the world and we have you're gonna have 14 of them
1595840	1598720	Uh, so that's great if you want to knock off a country
1599360	1601680	If you want to patrol the global oceans, no, no, no, no, no
1601760	1605840	Because you can only be in 14 places at once and that assumes they're all at sea, which never happens
1606400	1610000	So we no longer even have the military structure
1610560	1615200	That is necessary to guarantee global commerce. No country in the world does
1615840	1620080	So the most likely outcome of this is we'll get a series of regional powers
1620480	1625600	That have military force that is capable of kind of making a bubble a little sphere of influence
1626480	1628560	And there will be trade within those bubbles
1629120	1632480	But the trade between the bubbles is going to be very very sketchy
1633200	1638080	Difficult to regulate difficult to protect and by definition can't really be very long distance
1639040	1641040	That eliminates a lot of what's out there
1641440	1643440	What are you protecting?
1643920	1645920	The seas from is this
1646480	1651600	Criminals and people that are going to steal ships is is that the risk that happens?
1651600	1655840	I'm trying to work out the difference between the current state and the state where there are few destroyers
1656240	1657280	patrolling the seas
1657280	1659920	Well pre-world war two is usually imperial competition
1660880	1664640	If you didn't have something that you thought you needed you went out and you took it and if somebody else had it
1664720	1666800	You have a nice little war with a naval component
1667760	1673360	During the cold war it has been i'm sorry just during the post-cold war era piracy has come back in a very big way
1674560	1675520	It's
1675520	1677520	more an irritant
1677600	1682320	But if you look back to pre-world war two privateerian was all kinds of fun
1682960	1688400	And the idea that you didn't have to go out and raid your opponents shipping yourself. You get as high or someone to do it
1689120	1693840	I expect to see a lot more of that. Oh, so that was what I was thinking. I was thinking this sounds very
1694720	1695920	primitive
1695920	1697920	very medieval that
1698080	1699600	countries that
1699600	1701600	publicly are at peace and
1702320	1703680	have their
1703680	1710320	Diplomats going to visit each other and conversations and they're sat around tables together agreeing about stuff that they would try and steal
1711360	1716960	Shipments of potatoes or whatever it is that's going on or metals that seemed a little bit unlikely
1716960	1718960	but what you're saying is that
1718960	1723120	There are ways around committing outright acts of naval war
1723680	1728160	By I mean you can have state piracy basically using your military to grab things direct
1728560	1733520	You can have privateering where you rely on third parties to do it and provide safe harbor
1734240	1736240	And then you can have flat-out piracy
1736960	1740320	We've dealt with all of them in the past. We're going to have to deal with all of them in the future
1740720	1744880	Do you think that's is that realistic though in the current state where?
1745520	1748880	Information is able to be pushed around the world super quickly and
1749440	1751440	sanctions and public
1751680	1757920	lambasting and so on and so forth would someone really come out and try and steal some ships whether under the cover of
1758560	1761760	A bunch of guys that rush has been doing it for six months
1765360	1767360	Okay, yeah, yeah
1768240	1772960	They are at war though, right when you break down the rules of action and when you remove the security guarantor
1773440	1777120	Countries do what they feel they need to whether it's out of opportunity or desperation
1778160	1782880	Interesting. Okay. So that's globalization globalization. Let's say that it does
1783520	1788400	Start to slow down. What are the knock-on effects of that? Oh, dear god. Okay
1790400	1792400	So I just wrote this book
1794080	1802240	The book split into six big chapters based on the various economic sectors so transport finance energy industrial commodities agriculture manufacturing
1803440	1805440	Everything that we understand
1805760	1809920	About all six is dependent upon the idea of global security
1810240	1816240	And so you remove the global security and all six of them have to unwind and reform in different ways
1816640	1821840	So really it's kind of pick your poison with transport long haul goes out the window
1822480	1828960	That's an end to among other things super tankers. So if you are getting your oil from 3 000 or more miles away
1830240	1832240	You're out of luck
1833680	1840160	Ships are going to have to be smaller and go faster because the concentrated risk that a giant container vessel has
1840560	1842880	You lose one of those and the shipping company goes away
1843760	1848000	If you're doing smaller tankers or smaller ships that are going faster, they can't carry as much
1848160	1853840	You just lost most intermediate goods trade. That's an end to electronics manufacturing in its current form
1854720	1857840	So you can play this on really any topic that you want
1858240	1864480	But the structures that have all held it together and made it work are dependent upon the ceiling not falling
1865200	1866640	And it's falling
1866640	1872640	It seems to me like the current way that the world's setup has got most people myself included
1872880	1874960	To believe that everyone's just a bit nicer now
1875680	1877680	Than we were for most of human history
1878800	1882000	Do you understand what I mean that it's uh, how would you say?
1883120	1884080	it's
1884080	1886080	global policing masquerading as
1886800	1888800	virtuous human nature
1889440	1892400	We established penalties for people who didn't play
1893040	1897680	And because the americans started with europe, which was the headquarters of most of the empires
1898720	1900720	It's stuck
1900960	1906080	The only non european empire that mattered at the time was the soviet union, which was the target of all this
1906400	1908640	And japan, which was subjugated
1909120	1914160	So everyone who in the past had been a bad actor if you want to use that very loaded term
1914720	1920560	All of a sudden was on the same side everyone who had ever had a projection based military throughout human history
1920880	1922880	Was in the same coalition
1924160	1925840	It worked
1925840	1927840	for a while
1928000	1931120	You've said that energy is one of the sub components of globalization
1931200	1937040	Presumably because in order to get the energy you need to move it around the world in order to take it from where it's taken from
1937120	1939120	To where it needs to be used
1939600	1946080	Is just how crucial of a port a point is energy because alex epstein's been on the show nate haigans been on the show
1946560	1948560	Richard betz from the ipcc has been on the show
1948640	1951920	I understand that they have their priors with regards to where their research lies
1952240	1957280	But obviously their focus is that especially with nate, you know energy is is absolutely everything
1957840	1963360	What are your views on the current sort of state of the energy climate and then moving forward to climate change as well?
1964080	1967200	I would say that there's not a lot of light between me and those names
1967280	1970560	I mean obviously when you get into the details analysts can quibble about everything
1971040	1973040	And they can they do absolutely
1973520	1977200	But the the core idea that without energy none of this works is solid
1978560	1985280	We've spent the last 70 years bringing the energy from where it's produced to where it's consumed which means primarily from the middle east
1985360	1992160	To europe and east asia north america is more or less the self-contained component even was before the shale revolution now
1992240	1993760	It certainly is
1994560	1999440	That was one of the prices the americans paid in order to get their alliance is making sure the energy would flow
2000160	2002160	In the environment we're in now
2002160	2006320	We're at a risk of losing all russian crude
2007040	2012320	Now i've always thought this was going to happen eventually. I didn't think it was going to happen this soon
2013920	2016880	Russian crude is what has largely fueled
2017760	2020000	The global economic expansion since 92
2020720	2027120	Because when the soviet system collapsed their energy production did not and all of their commodities were just dumped on the international market
2027920	2031920	And that has kept prices relatively low for 35 years
2032480	2035760	That period is now closing and so we're going to lose
2037040	2040400	Five percent of global crude which doesn't sound like a big deal
2040960	2043520	Until you remember that energy demand is inelastic
2044160	2048960	And a five percent loss in crude can easily generate a tripling in price
2049760	2054160	So an energy induced depression that is broadly global in scope
2054720	2057920	Will start because of the ukraine war at some point
2058480	2061920	And this is probably the reason that no one's gone after that raft yet
2062960	2068640	Because that would be the death blow for the russian energy sector. So that would kind of be like have you seen a
2071040	2073040	Margin call the movie
2073760	2078400	Not recently now, but do you remember what it was about? Was it a 2008 financial crisis?
2078480	2081920	And it's it's semi-fictional and they bring everybody in overnight
2082000	2088240	And they say look if you decide to do this if you decide to dump all of everything into the market you are choosing to begin
2089680	2095200	The most armageddon like financial situation that anyone's ever seen. So that that's interesting
2095760	2099120	That for somebody to go and do that. They're aware that downstream
2099760	2105600	Five degrees of separation. There are a bunch of externalities that are basically going to ruin everyone the whole system. Yeah now
2107600	2109600	The math is going to be different for everybody
2109680	2112720	Like take take latvia latvia has the capacity to do this
2112800	2116320	All they have to do is grab one shuttle tanker as it's leaving st. Petersburg
2116480	2122160	That would do it and the latvians have already managed to wean themselves off of russian crude
2122240	2124880	And while it would crush most of the european partners
2125280	2129840	They would see the destruction of the primary income stream for russia as an unalloyed good
2130720	2136800	Or consider the americans. We're self-sufficient. We have the capacity of putting a wall around our energy exports
2136800	2138320	So they stay at home
2138320	2142400	So we could actually see energy prices in the us go down because of this
2143680	2147840	But then the rest of the world would lose access to russian and american crude at the same time
2148720	2150880	So everyone has their own math to run
2151360	2157840	And a lot of it is going to depend upon how everyone interprets the loyalty or the actions of their allies
2157840	2162400	So i mean look at germany the russians are in the process of jerking with the
2162880	2167200	Germans on natural gas and you know for those of us and the rest of the world like yeah natural gas
2167200	2170720	It's an energy source. Whatever. No biggie. That's not what it is in germany
2171120	2174400	The entire german economy is based on taking a cheap russian gas
2174880	2179360	Processing it to petrochemicals and then using those inputs in the entire manufacturing sector
2179680	2185280	If they lose that gas, it's not just that the electricity prices go off. It's that the german manufacturing model fails
2186560	2188960	So the germans are being presented with the choice
2190080	2192080	Leave the coalition
2193440	2195440	And keep the lights on
2195440	2201920	Or lose your gas and no longer be modern. So what's more important to the germans being western or being modern?
2202720	2204720	That's a that's a shit choice
2205440	2208640	But it has consequences and people will judge them down based on what they do
2209840	2212800	Peter you need to give me something positive here, man. I'm just i'm
2213440	2216560	Terrified this this doesn't sound like a very good situation
2217280	2220560	At all. What are the bright lights? What are some of the bright lights?
2220960	2224160	There are countries that were damaged by globalization
2224960	2229280	The empire specifically if you were a country that had a pretty good geography at the start of this
2230080	2235760	Then when the americans came through and changed the rules so that everyone can play you saw a massive drop in your overall power
2237040	2239040	If you are one of those countries
2239360	2240560	and
2240560	2242560	You have a positive demographic structure
2242960	2249600	You could actually make a lot of hay out of what's coming because you could I don't want to use the word imperial narrow imperial might be the right word
2250560	2252640	You can definitely make a bid for your own neighborhood
2253040	2257840	So the two countries that are on the top of my list is regards that are turkey and france
2258320	2264160	decent demographics good manufacturing base largely not integrated into their neighborhoods economically
2264880	2267760	The french actually trade less with the eu than the brits do
2269360	2271040	Fun fact
2271040	2276080	And I can see part of western europe becoming part of a french fife toman obviously parts of the middle east
2276560	2280240	For turkey. I would have put japan on that list
2281120	2284800	But the japanese managed to cut a deal with both donald trump and joe biden
2284960	2291040	Which makes the japanese the only people who have been able to get on with both sides of the american spectrum of elate
2291360	2294960	So I think they've basically agreed to partner up with the us rather than go the wrong way
2294960	2298560	Which I think will be the best for everyone in the long term unless you're chinese, of course
2299440	2301440	How's the uk gonna do?
2301600	2305920	That's up to you. Uh, you really need to figure out this brexit thing
2306880	2312960	I mean, it's just yes, you've left, but you still don't have any plan for what's next and that is really hurting you
2313520	2316480	Uh with every day that that is pushed off
2316960	2320480	Your negotiating power with whatever the structures of the future
2320960	2322960	End up looking like are going to be weaker and weaker
2323360	2329040	And you're very rapidly getting to the point where the only option you're going to have is a trade deal with the united states on america's terms
2329840	2331840	There are worse things that could happen
2331920	2333920	but uh, we will be as um
2334960	2336960	It's best way to phrase this
2336960	2340640	We believe be as gentle in the negotiations as we were during the lend lease talks
2341280	2346080	Where you basically had to give up half of a hemisphere of military presence in exchange for 40
2346560	2348880	destroyers that you're used to laugh at because they were so bad
2351440	2355440	Not good it doesn't seem no, it's not a good negotiating position. That's for sure
2355680	2360800	Okay, you think that mexico is going to be a big part of america's future. Also, canada's good because it's able to
2361280	2365040	Yeah, uh, because it's able to do good immigration. It's able to keep its demographics pretty well
2365280	2367680	What's the future for america look like in your opinion?
2368320	2374560	Well, the united states is starting this process with very little trade exposure to the wider world outside of
2375200	2379440	manufacturing in asia, uh, a net energy exporter of all forms
2380000	2383920	A the largest refining power in the world the largest agricultural power in the world
2384000	2388400	So a lot of the things that every single country in the world is just going to have to stress about us
2388480	2391600	It's just kind of a no brainer. It's already there. Uh, in addition
2392240	2394240	successful manufacturing requires
2394480	2395920	proximate
2395920	2402000	Labor that is at different skill sets and price points. So the person who's doing the injection molding is not the
2402400	2404400	Same guy who's making the microchip
2404800	2406800	With mexico, we've got that already
2406880	2409680	So for us a lot of the hard work has already been done
2410080	2415840	And while i'm not a huge fan of donald trump by any measure his renegotiation of nafta was a stroke of genius
2416000	2418000	And it got ahead of a lot of these issues
2419040	2420560	um
2420640	2425200	Because of that north america's a unit looks pretty strong and we're already seeing
2426160	2433280	Established linkages to other powers that might be useful. So we for example already have free trade deals with columbian chile
2433520	2436800	Which are in my opinion the two most dynamic south american economies
2437600	2441280	We already have a long-term agreement with both the koreans and the japanese
2442080	2447360	The australians have a free trade deal with the united states and we're in league with the australians and the japanese
2447680	2453840	Really starting to become engaged with southeast asia, which is another part of the world where the demographics and the geography line up
2454400	2456400	so that kind of
2456880	2459760	greater american co-prosperity sphere
2460400	2462720	Is about as good as it's going to get
2463200	2466480	I mean, you'll have to deal with the americans when you tend to be a little twitchy sometimes
2467600	2472000	But we're twitchy in a different hemisphere for most of the partners, which most people really like
2473360	2477520	In your neck of the woods, france is just going to be completely insufferable
2478800	2481040	Because they're going to become the broker for the germans
2481040	2484320	They're going to become the the first power in iberia and in italy
2484720	2487120	And they're probably going to make a bid for the low countries too
2487680	2491600	And the longer it takes the uk to become a self-sustaining power again
2492400	2495360	The more advantage the french are going to have in rewriting the local rules
2495600	2501280	So a good example is that, you know, you've you've built these two super carriers. They're top-notch pieces of equipment
2501920	2506400	But between budget cuts and austerity and the financial crisis
2506880	2508880	You let the rest of your navy die
2508960	2512640	So you've got these two fantastic vessels with no defensive rings
2513200	2518960	Which means the only way that you would ever let them leave port is if they're sailing as part of an american battle group
2519920	2522080	Again, not a good negotiating position
2522960	2526320	What ways could america mess this up? Oh, so many so many
2528640	2533360	We're in one of our once in every generation or two politically shufflings and as long as that is going on
2533360	2535360	We really don't have eyes for the rest of the world
2535920	2541760	So there's a huge strategic and economic opportunity here for the long run if the united states would chose to leave and kind of
2541760	2543760	Define what the new world was going to be
2544480	2550160	What i've outlined here is probably what's going to happen on autopilot and in many cases because the australians
2550960	2556720	And the canadians and the japanese are doing most of the diplomatic heavy lifting. Thank god. They're there because it would be a mess otherwise
2559280	2562000	One of the great things to keep in mind about the united states
2562480	2567920	Is because the population is so big and so young and because the land area is so huge and so fertile
2568320	2570640	We've never had to be at the top of our game
2571440	2575520	We can rely on geography and demography to do most of the heavy lifting for us
2575760	2578800	And that allows our politics to be completely batshit
2580400	2584640	And that's where we are now there are many degrees of freedom that you can mess up within yes
2585280	2590960	This this isn't france where if you screw up you have to pay for it for two generations
2592640	2596160	If the us population is big and young
2596880	2601360	Does that not mean that downstream from that you need to have an even bigger younger
2602320	2607760	population in order to not end up with that inverted pyramid shape on your
2608320	2611120	Demographics it's definitely possible um our our
2612080	2618720	What while most of europe and japan and korea have that v shape in their demographics ours is more of a double hour glass
2618800	2621680	because we've got a bulge where the boomers are and then a bulge where the
2622640	2626640	Millennials are but then a big cut out for gen x and a big cut out for the zoomers
2629040	2634000	The ins and outs of that are going to dominate our economic and our financial world for forever
2635200	2637680	So right now we're about to go through a capital crunch
2638480	2642720	In 15 years when the millennials are in their 50s, we will be going through a capital boom
2644240	2648960	As a rule large generations make large generations and small generations make small generations
2648960	2650960	So we would expect this
2650960	2652960	wave to continue
2653520	2656880	What that means is that the american propensity for
2657600	2659600	Overdoing things and then over correcting
2660160	2664880	That's just part of our dna now and it's backed up by our demographics. That will take us
2665760	2670720	All number of bizarre directions and we will drag along a lot of other countries with for the ride
2671200	2676800	I was with jonathan height a few months ago. It's the heterodox academy conference and he was talking about the
2677520	2683680	dangers in the dating market for gen z at the moment the high levels of social anxiety the fact that you've got
2684160	2689920	One third of people aged 18 to 35 is still living at home with their parents the number of 18 to 30 year olds
2690000	2694080	Reporting no sex is tripled in the last 10 years from about 10 to 30 percent
2695040	2699840	A bunch of things that are causing young people to be less socially out there
2700240	2705760	Presumably to have children later. I think it's 2019 that for the first time ever more women had children over the age of 40
2705760	2711200	Than under the age of 20 for the first time ever in history more women at the age of 30 were childless
2712240	2714720	Rather than with child. So all of these things
2715920	2717520	seem
2717520	2722400	Like they would predict a ever aging gen generation or an ever-ranging demographic
2723280	2728960	What your suggestion is that you have this sort of hourglass shape and there will be some sort of inflection point presumably with the
2729600	2731600	15 year capital boom
2732320	2735280	Probably that would should hopefully encourage
2736080	2738080	More families more children more population
2738800	2745360	Offset this going from an hourglass into a inverted pyramid. That's what the data we have today suggests
2745440	2748320	But I've got to underline. We're in uncharted territory here
2748880	2754800	The world has never had a population bust without having some sort of massive endemic disease or war event
2755680	2758640	So when I say, you know, the chinese collapse has to happen
2758720	2764640	You know, I don't know how you make it work without kids or young adults when I say that the americans are going to experience a
2765440	2768160	Another baby boom as the millennials really come into their own
2768720	2773840	History and data suggests that but we've really never seen this combination of factors before
2775680	2777360	The zoomers
2777360	2779280	I have concerns
2779280	2784000	They are not like millennials. Millennials are very outgoing. They're very social
2784960	2788480	Because they were raised by the baby boomers and they were always told that they were special
2788480	2790480	That's one of the reasons why a third of them still live at home
2792320	2795440	The zoomers were grazed by gen X my generation
2796480	2801680	And we took a very different view of things, you know, we kept track of the score at the soccer game
2801760	2804560	We wrote it down. We showed it to him before each game
2804640	2810000	We read it to him to bed so that they wouldn't forget and when they turn 18, they're the hell out of the house
2810960	2814240	Uh, they're they're insular. They're competitive
2815120	2818640	They don't like relying on anyone for anything
2818720	2824720	And so the whole group dynamics and managerial dynamics that the millennials are positively known for and recognized for
2825520	2830240	They're the antithesis their dream job is to code alone in the dark in a closet
2831600	2833600	And that makes it hard to have kids
2834240	2839200	So I think we can guarantee that when it's the zoomers time when they're in their 30s
2839280	2843360	That their birth rates are going to be low their marriage rates are probably going to be the worst we've ever had
2843680	2846320	Their suicide rates are already the worst we've ever had
2847520	2850960	Which just means that the millennials will save us all
2851440	2855520	Okay, right. You're relying on you're relying on me and my heart fantastic
2856000	2858960	Given given the current state and obviously there's lots of
2859440	2865440	Contributing different countries. What's going on with demographics people talk about a population collapse overall globally
2866000	2868240	What is your view of global population?
2869280	2870560	uh
2870560	2876400	Before we start talking about de-globalization so assuming that globalization continues from its height onward
2876880	2880560	We were already in the process of revising down our estimates
2881120	2886400	So it used to be 15 years ago that we thought by 2050 we were going to have 11 to 12 billion people
2886960	2891760	That number is now under 10 and as the data continues to get upgraded will probably
2892720	2898240	Assuming nothing goes wrong peak at just below nine and then start falling back gently
2899520	2901520	If i'm right about de-globalization
2902400	2907200	We're going to have a significantly sharper drop-off and as soon as globalization hits agriculture at large
2907200	2909280	Which may be in the fourth quarter of this year
2910400	2912400	population peaks
2913120	2916400	Wow, okay positive stuff
2919360	2921680	Looking at the ways in which
2922640	2926640	Population collapse and the reduction of that could be tied in with automation
2927360	2934320	Is there any technological savior that can come through and assist us with the problems that we're facing at the moment?
2934320	2937760	There's always unknown unknowns when it comes to technology. I'm aware of that, but
2938720	2945760	Are there things that you can foresee if we get particular advancements that may alleviate some of this absolutely so pros and cons
2945760	2951280	Uh, there are a lot of technologies with automation AI and robotics that look really good now
2951520	2954080	AI the whole idea of general AI and skynet
2954880	2959520	Decades away from that. So I was put that in a box. I'll let Ian must talk about that
2960640	2963280	AI is all about image recognition today
2964000	2966720	And getting it so that machines can recognize different things and then
2967440	2972080	Do pre-program tasks? There's no there's no real autonomy, but it's automated
2973680	2978960	That allows manufacturing to reshape, but it also requires massive economies of scale
2979440	2984000	The most expensive thing a country can do isn't industrialize. It's to automate
2985280	2986960	And it's not a one-off cost
2986960	2990240	You have to constantly update it because every time there's a change to the production line
2990400	2995440	You more or less have to start over with the programming. So it's a very expensive way to go
2995920	2998640	It does use different labor and less labor
2999040	3002240	But it's not clear to me that it really moves the needle in a huge way
3002800	3004800	And if we're breaking down
3005120	3011600	global transport and intermediate goods trade, then we're losing the economies of scale that make that model work
3013200	3016000	In north america where you've got one third of global consumption
3016800	3020960	We'll probably still be doing that, but I see that broadly leaving the east asian sphere
3021840	3024080	Which combined with their bad demographics are awful
3024640	3027920	We also have the baby boomers leaving so that we know that the capital crunch is coming
3028080	3030960	That means less money is available to do this sort of upgrading
3032240	3037840	The technology I was most interested in are the combination of automation and agriculture
3038400	3043040	We're very close to having facilities that you can latch on to a tractor
3043600	3046240	That identify each individual plant
3046880	3051840	And identify if it needs water or fertilizer or pesticide or if it's a weed or whatever
3051840	3053840	And then it gets a squirt of whatever is appropriate
3054080	3059120	So you do like six passes of stuff in one pass and each plant gets individual attention
3060000	3066000	That suggests that we would be able to reduce fertilizer and pesticide use by 80 percent
3066960	3068960	And maybe even double yields
3069520	3071840	But again economies of scale
3072400	3076960	It only works on mega farms where you can afford the equipment cost
3077440	3083360	So if you've got giant farms in the united states or the netherlands or argentina or australia
3084000	3085600	Sure
3085600	3087600	Doesn't work for most of the world
3088400	3095280	Talking about technology. I've heard that we are unbelievably reliant on getting cheap technological parts out of china
3095920	3097920	Silicon chips and other such stuff
3098880	3104080	How much of an issue is it going to be if china is facing demographic collapse and then can't make anything anymore?
3104320	3107360	How much is that going to have downstream effects for the rest of the world's technology?
3108160	3113120	Well, we've been a little bit lucky that the chinese have kind of become a bag of dicks and really
3114000	3117920	Encouraged everyone to outsource and resource everything that they can
3118800	3120800	It's that's bought us a lot of time
3120800	3123440	Now in the united states everyone is paranoid about
3123760	3130080	Semiconductors and we all see that 12 percent number that the us now only produces 12 percent of global chips as a panic point
3130480	3132480	But that's by number
3133040	3135200	By value we produce 60 percent
3135760	3139600	So all the chips are designed in japan and the united states
3139840	3144560	They might be manufactured somewhere else if they're further down the the scale
3145440	3151520	But in terms of cell phones and server farms the important stuff that that's already safe
3152800	3158800	The problem is going to be the mid and the lower land the mid ones are usually malaysian thailand the lower ones are almost certainly china
3161280	3164480	So when you're talking about the lower tech stuff the internet of things
3164560	3166240	Yeah, that's just going away
3166240	3172320	But i'd argue that i don't really need a meat thermometer that is going to tell my phone what the temperature of the meat is
3172560	3175040	I mean we can get by without that. I think
3175840	3179040	It's overall electronics manufacturer. That's going to be the big issue
3179520	3182960	As remember differentiated labor forces is what makes manufacturing work
3183520	3184720	China is a huge place
3184720	3190400	It's got a lot of that internally and then it has access immediately to taiwan japan korea and southeast asia
3191040	3193440	That's what's breaking down that whole ecosystem
3194400	3199840	Uh, we can't rebuild all of that. I mean just just to serve
3200480	3205440	Electronics needs for north america probably would require a workforce of four million people in manufacturing
3205920	3207920	We're already in labor shortage
3207920	3212240	And the mexicans are kind of tapped out already. So there is going to be a huge amount of pressure
3212960	3215360	americans do well at the really high-end manufacturing
3216000	3218400	And the very low end because we're energy rich
3218880	3223200	It's the part in the middle that we're really reliant on the mexicans to save us for
3224080	3226080	What ways could you be wrong about all of this stuff?
3226640	3230960	You know, like I said, this is perspective. We're dealing with an environment that we've never been in before
3231680	3232960	uh
3232960	3234960	The way I would like to be wrong
3234960	3240560	Is that the americans would actually do what george herbert walker bush wanted to do back in 1991?
3240560	3244480	And have a conversation with ourselves about what sort of world we wanted to live in and how to get there
3245440	3249280	We weren't interested then I would argue that we're really not interested now
3250240	3255760	So the risk here from my point of view is that globalization does manage to persist because of some
3256160	3258160	Green american commitment
3258240	3264320	I'm not seeing that. I'm certainly not seeing that with the ukraine war. Yes. We're seeing nato having a new lease on life
3264880	3269120	But the whole guns for butter deal that we made during the cold war
3269760	3276640	None of the economic stuff is on the agenda all the sanctions that the trump administration enacted are still there with one exception
3276640	3278640	that the airbus case
3278640	3279920	uh
3279920	3282160	I don't see it's very likely and then on the demographic front
3282160	3287280	That's just math if you want more 30 years 30 year olds. You had to start 31 years ago
3289600	3292560	What difference would it make if china invaded taiwan?
3293760	3298080	Uh, that would probably lead to the end of the chinese system as an industrialized economy in less than a year
3298720	3300720	Um, why that's fascinating
3301360	3304320	It's an open question of whether or not the chinese could pull it off
3305040	3308960	And with the ukraine war, we finally got some good signposts of what it might look like
3309440	3311440	The chinese have always assumed
3311840	3313840	That the war would be a walkover
3313840	3319360	That no one else will get involved and that china is such a big place that everyone will just suck it up and move on
3320080	3327120	Well, that clearly hasn't happened with ukraine and the united states and the west have a much tighter relationship with taiwan than they do with ukraine
3327920	3332160	ukraine was only preparing for this war for eight years taiwan has been preparing for 60
3332880	3338400	Uh ukraine can you can walk to ukraine from russia? It's a bit of a swim to get to taiwan
3339200	3345040	The sanctions that are in place against russia would absolutely devastate china because well russia has a lot of faults
3345120	3347120	It's a major exporter of food and energy
3347520	3349520	china imports those things
3350480	3354880	75 percent of their oil is imported from a different continent
3356160	3358160	Uh, and 75 percent of the oil is imported
3359120	3363760	And then i think it's really the boycotts that have really scared the chinese the most
3364320	3368080	The idea that individual citizens might have any say on policy
3368960	3373200	They had they did not see that coming. They have no way to process that in a one-man state
3373440	3376960	Because it's so different to the setup that they have. Yeah, exactly
3376960	3381760	So every assumption that they've based the last 40 years of military planning on is proven to be wrong
3382720	3385280	And then of course there's the question of whether they could actually do it
3386480	3390880	If they did a slow-motion mobilization like the russians did took three months
3391360	3393280	The taiwanese would see that
3393280	3395520	they built a few nukes and so
3396480	3399600	The cost of capturing taiwan would be losing shanghai and beijing
3400400	3401920	That doesn't seem like a good plan
3401920	3409040	So the only battle plan that i've seen that might work is if they just text every member of the army and say go to a port
3409040	3411040	Get on a fishing boat and sail
3412400	3414400	You'd lose a million people in the crossing
3415520	3417520	Just to get to the beaches
3417520	3419760	So there's nothing about this that works
3420400	3423440	And if they did pull it off even if they do capture taiwan
3423520	3427920	They are now cut off from global manufacturing global investment global energy and global food
3428720	3433840	Truck stop running within a couple of months the lights go out in less than six and that is all she wrote
3433920	3438080	Remember agriculture is an industrial sector. So you're talking about mass famine in under a year
3439200	3441200	dude
3441200	3444080	Now normally i'd say the chinese aren't stupid they wouldn't do this
3444400	3446400	But it's a one-man show now
3446880	3450320	And nobody wants to bring ji any information because they don't know how he'll react
3450320	3455200	He's shot the messenger literally so many times that everything is a surprise to him
3456000	3458000	Yes, I understand what you mean
3458000	3459200	I suppose
3459200	3463840	There's a lot of criticisms around the fact that the vote of a stupid person is worth as much as the vote of a
3464000	3466000	While educated person in a democracy
3466080	3469280	But the problem is if you condense all of that
3470000	3475040	Power down to a single individual the decision of an angry or grumpy
3475360	3480960	Individual is the same as them on a good day or them if they were less idiotic or somebody else had got to power
3481280	3483280	So yeah, I suppose it's a
3483600	3489280	Forcing function that condenses all of these things down to one individual human that is just as fallible as the rest of
3489360	3491760	Maybe even more fallible human is perfect
3493040	3495040	Every time okay
3495920	3500080	But even a minor mistake just cascades through the system and it's a full cult of personality
3500160	3505360	So, you know, we've got basically people who are zealotously trying to do what they think ji wants them to do
3505760	3509360	And just one of the more inane ones is seeing teams of people in hazmat gear
3509920	3511920	disinfecting airport runways
3512240	3514240	Because they think that's what you have to do for covid
3514640	3520480	Just that people talk about the americans now in a fact-free zone. That's nothing compared to what's going on in the chinese system
3522880	3527840	Okay, so what do you think uh for most of the people that are listening to this uk us some in australia
3528240	3533600	What is life going to be like? What is the quality of life going to be like over the next 10 to 20 years?
3533680	3535040	What can people expect?
3535040	3541280	Well, the next five years are going to be rough. We basically in the west need to at least double the size of our industrial plant
3541600	3545200	Um, let me correct that in the west minus germany
3545760	3547760	Germany is its own special case
3547760	3551520	Everyone else has largely hollowed out their manufacturing as part of globalization
3551520	3553680	We focus on the really high end stuff in the design
3554080	3557600	But a lot of the middle and the lower stuff is now done in other countries. That's got to change
3558320	3563040	If you are part of a network where you can access lower skilled labor like the americans are with the mexicans
3563520	3568080	Great, if you're not you either need to attach yourself to another system
3569600	3571600	Or find some way to go without
3572880	3577120	Now if you are in that kind of friends and family network of the americans
3577920	3579440	energy is covered
3579440	3580720	Food is covered
3580720	3582720	Investment will be tight but available
3583520	3586160	And there's a degree of security that you won't have in the rest of the world
3586480	3589120	So the biggest problem is going to be building out that industrial plant
3589680	3597040	That means we should expect inflation in the us of maybe nine to 15 percent for the next five or six years
3597680	3599920	Is that's what it's going to take to get through this?
3600400	3604080	And if we do succeed at building that industrial plant over that time frame
3604480	3608160	Then that inflation rate will come down and we'll have supply chains that are shorter
3608720	3609680	simpler
3609680	3613040	Cheaper and closer to the end consumer so better all around
3613680	3615680	So if you're part of that network
3616000	3619120	And you can get through over that hump it looks pretty good
3620240	3622240	If you decide to go your own way
3622800	3624800	Things are going to get a lot tougher
3624880	3630160	Unless you are one of those regional powers who actually has the geography and demography to make it work
3630800	3632160	France
3632160	3637040	After the financial collapse of say the euro might not notice the rest of the world going to hell
3638000	3644320	Uh, their manufacturing is already in place their energy system is fine. They've got oil just across the Mediterranean
3644400	3648240	They're going to have subsidiary economies in spain in italy. It's a fairly good setup
3650400	3656560	That means that cost of living is going to increase that means cost of energy is going to increase quality of life going to go down
3656640	3659760	I mean, are we going to see civil strife in your opinion? What's going to go on?
3660080	3662080	I think we'll see a lot of governments collapse
3662240	3664240	But again, it depends upon where you are
3664320	3667920	The americans will always complain more than what the problem is worth
3668640	3672800	Uh, and the fact that we're going through our political transition at the same time we're doing this is, you know
3672960	3674960	Awkward to say the least
3675040	3680240	We're going to blame a lot of things on a lot of things that have no direct connection. That's very american
3681120	3684560	Uh, if you're talking about britain, that's up to you guys
3685440	3690000	Because like, you know, if you can figure this out and figure out a relationship with the united states or the french
3690800	3693440	Before the break that would be your best bet
3694400	3699280	Is that because after the break bargaining power goes through the floor? Yeah, exactly
3700080	3704640	Now is the time to cut a deal. You've just had a change in government. The ukraine war is hot and heavy
3705760	3709920	If you were going to have a lead or take the country in a more sustainable direction now is the time
3710560	3714560	If people want to keep up to date with the stuff that you're doing with the work with
