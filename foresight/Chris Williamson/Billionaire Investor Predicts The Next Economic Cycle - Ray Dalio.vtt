WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.880
We're on the brink of war with China for various reasons.

00:02.880 --> 00:04.800
I hope we make it to 2050.

00:04.800 --> 00:07.120
The demographics is as I describe it.

00:07.120 --> 00:10.320
And by the way, them losing doesn't make us winning.

00:10.320 --> 00:12.800
So I think you're in the part of the cycle

00:12.800 --> 00:14.880
where you've had the tightening

00:14.880 --> 00:17.760
and the dominoes are beginning to fall.

00:17.760 --> 00:20.640
And I think that that's going to produce more problems.

00:20.640 --> 00:22.800
The most important thing is to have

00:22.800 --> 00:26.320
this basic, well-diversified portfolio as important.

00:26.320 --> 00:32.000
Two years ago, you made some predictions

00:32.000 --> 00:35.280
about the future for America and the global economy.

00:35.840 --> 00:37.040
How accurate do you think you've been?

00:38.320 --> 00:41.280
Uncomfortably accurate, given the whole picture.

00:43.040 --> 00:46.400
It's like watching the movie over and over again.

00:47.360 --> 00:48.560
Maybe I should explain.

00:51.600 --> 00:55.200
For about 55 years, I've been a global macro investor

00:55.200 --> 00:59.040
and I learned that many of the things that surprised me

00:59.040 --> 01:01.520
never happened in my lifetime before.

01:01.520 --> 01:06.640
So when I would see certain things happen that were like that,

01:06.640 --> 01:11.280
I would go back in history and study prior periods.

01:11.280 --> 01:14.320
And studying, for example, the Great Depression

01:14.320 --> 01:17.840
allowed us to anticipate the financial crisis in 2008.

01:17.840 --> 01:22.880
Anyway, there are three big things that I observed happening

01:22.880 --> 01:26.560
that didn't happen in our lifetimes,

01:26.560 --> 01:30.320
but happened during the 1930 to 45 period.

01:30.320 --> 01:34.560
And they are the creation of enormous amounts of debt

01:35.120 --> 01:38.800
and the printing of money to pay for those debts

01:38.800 --> 01:43.680
and it having its economic effects on inflation and growth.

01:44.560 --> 01:47.920
The second is internal conflicts

01:48.800 --> 01:54.400
over the largest wealth gaps we had since then, values gaps.

01:55.680 --> 02:00.320
And the rise of populism of the right and the left,

02:01.760 --> 02:07.200
those conflicts, again, largest since that 1930 to 45 period.

02:07.920 --> 02:12.720
And then the rise of a great power,

02:13.680 --> 02:17.680
producing a great powers conflict internationally

02:18.880 --> 02:21.280
with the rise of China as a great power,

02:22.080 --> 02:25.200
challenging the United States and with Russia.

02:25.200 --> 02:29.440
So the great power conflict, that also is the most

02:29.440 --> 02:32.960
that that's happened since the Great Depression.

02:32.960 --> 02:37.280
So because those three things are happening now,

02:38.000 --> 02:43.040
and I didn't study them, I went back and I needed to study

02:43.040 --> 02:46.800
the cycles, what's happened over longer periods of time.

02:46.800 --> 02:51.040
So I studied the last 500 years because these big cycles

02:52.080 --> 02:56.800
take about 75 years and give or take about 50.

02:58.480 --> 03:02.000
And like the rise and decline of the British Empire,

03:02.000 --> 03:03.280
the rise and decline of the debt.

03:04.240 --> 03:09.920
And that dynamic I shared in the book, and I also shared it

03:09.920 --> 03:15.520
in an animated video, which is called The Changing World Order.

03:16.880 --> 03:19.600
And that creates a path.

03:19.600 --> 03:22.880
Now, it's not just because they repeat in this way,

03:23.440 --> 03:26.240
but one can see the cause-effect relationships

03:26.880 --> 03:28.080
that are happening.

03:28.080 --> 03:34.400
And so that has pretty much transpired according to script.

03:34.960 --> 03:39.680
We can get into those pieces, but I'd say those are the three main ones.

03:39.680 --> 03:42.880
There were two others that had big effect

03:42.880 --> 03:46.400
that I paid more attention to that I'll mention.

03:46.400 --> 03:52.000
One was acts of nature in the form of droughts, floods and pandemics.

03:52.880 --> 03:55.840
They were very disruptive when they happened, killed more people

03:55.840 --> 04:00.960
and toppled more empires or waters than others.

04:01.520 --> 04:04.400
And then also, of course, over a period of time,

04:04.400 --> 04:07.280
there's learning and producing new technologies

04:07.280 --> 04:09.440
that raises living standards.

04:09.440 --> 04:12.880
You know, it's raised per capita income life expectancy and so on.

04:12.880 --> 04:19.760
And so, but those five factors transpire in ways that we've seen before

04:19.760 --> 04:21.600
to create this big cycle.

04:22.160 --> 04:25.840
And if we can look at the cause-effect relationships,

04:27.440 --> 04:29.280
that's what I want to pass along.

04:29.280 --> 04:32.960
Because I'm 74 years old and I'm in a phase in my life

04:32.960 --> 04:35.520
that I want to pass along the things that are of value.

04:35.520 --> 04:37.120
And I think this is an important thing.

04:37.120 --> 04:39.760
But yes, it's transpiring according to script.

04:40.560 --> 04:42.960
Cassandra, yet again, unfortunately.

04:43.520 --> 04:47.040
What do you think is the likelihood of the meltdown of the dollar?

04:47.040 --> 04:49.040
Is America going to be wiped out at some point soon?

04:49.600 --> 04:56.480
I don't want, histrionics, you know, just, I don't want to overdo it.

04:56.480 --> 05:00.800
And I also don't want to just jump to conclusions.

05:01.600 --> 05:07.680
My goal here is to show people how the machine works,

05:07.680 --> 05:09.280
the cause-effect relationship.

05:09.280 --> 05:12.480
So I'm going to answer your question by explaining certain things.

05:12.480 --> 05:22.560
The dollar is held by countries in the form of debt.

05:22.560 --> 05:24.880
In other words, when you say, I'm holding the dollar,

05:26.160 --> 05:27.920
you're holding a debt instrument.

05:28.880 --> 05:32.960
And when we have a problem with the debt instrument,

05:33.520 --> 05:37.040
a few problems with it holding the debt instruments.

05:37.760 --> 05:40.800
And those problems are that, first of all,

05:41.520 --> 05:46.880
as a result of what the United States was in the world,

05:46.880 --> 05:51.920
the largest trading country, the dominant empire, and so on,

05:51.920 --> 05:59.840
there's been a huge accumulation of dollar denominated debt and dollars, therefore.

06:00.480 --> 06:06.640
And there's also been a lot of deficits that had to be funded,

06:06.640 --> 06:10.480
which happens by selling dollar denominated debt,

06:10.480 --> 06:14.080
which a lot of foreigners and banks and others bought.

06:14.800 --> 06:18.000
And so they have a lot of dollar denominated debt.

06:18.800 --> 06:24.640
Now, if you're a creditor, meaning an owner of dollar denominated debt,

06:25.360 --> 06:32.720
you need to have an interest rate that is high enough to more than compensate you for inflation.

06:33.520 --> 06:40.720
And so the production now of a lot more debt and them having a lot of debt,

06:41.360 --> 06:44.640
and then also sanctions internationally,

06:44.640 --> 06:48.160
which means freezing dollar denominated debt,

06:48.960 --> 06:54.960
all have created a reduction in the demand for dollar denominated debt.

06:55.600 --> 07:01.440
There's also concerns in the world about some of the things that are going on in the United States,

07:01.440 --> 07:04.960
and that's reduced that. As a result of that,

07:06.400 --> 07:11.120
you're seeing more transactions take place in other currencies.

07:11.840 --> 07:19.920
And if they take place in other currencies, then others want to save in those other currencies

07:21.120 --> 07:24.800
because that's how they pay for it. So if you want to save in what you pay for,

07:24.800 --> 07:31.600
you save more in it and less in dollars. And so that's the dynamic that is reducing

07:32.160 --> 07:40.080
the demand for dollars and dollar debt at the same time as the supply of it keeps coming,

07:40.080 --> 07:45.920
because we have large deficits. So the underlying value that those dollars

07:46.960 --> 07:51.440
represent isn't increasing, but the number of dollars spread across that is.

07:52.240 --> 07:57.600
Yeah, so that there's a supply-demand issue. That supply-demand issue, by the way,

07:58.160 --> 08:05.040
also exists in European currencies. Okay, they have too much debt and they're financed the same way.

08:05.760 --> 08:10.960
And Japanese currencies. And so what you're seeing is the movement,

08:12.400 --> 08:20.560
all that weight of money and debt is causing prices to go up, inflation. And that's also

08:20.560 --> 08:32.240
being worsened by the supply chain deteriorations that are due to the international conflict.

08:32.880 --> 08:41.120
So for example, in the case of, let's say China and the United States and other countries,

08:41.120 --> 08:48.400
as they prepare for the possibility of war, they want to be self-sufficient. And so

08:50.160 --> 08:58.000
as a result, they work on being self-sufficient more than integrated and efficient. And so

08:58.000 --> 09:04.400
that dynamic is playing an important role too. What do you think the next few years have got in

09:04.400 --> 09:14.720
store for us? Well, I'm going to take all three of those influences and answer it because they're

09:14.720 --> 09:24.320
all related. There's a business cycle or a short-term debt cycle, I call it,

09:25.200 --> 09:32.480
that sort of recession to recession and the way it works is you have a recession in weak economy,

09:32.480 --> 09:40.080
central banks stimulate credit growth, credit gives you buying power, you go out and buy,

09:40.080 --> 09:47.520
the economy picks up, and then that continues until you start to have inflation. Then they

09:47.520 --> 09:54.800
tighten monetary policy and then the economy weakens and it goes into the next recession.

09:55.600 --> 10:03.120
Since 1945, when the new world order began, in other words, we had the currency and also the

10:03.120 --> 10:10.240
American world order beginning in that, we've had 12 and a half of those cycles. They typically

10:10.240 --> 10:19.120
last about seven years, give or take about three. And so we are now about halfway through this cycle

10:19.120 --> 10:27.440
in which they did the stimulation, inflation rises, they tighten monetary policy,

10:27.440 --> 10:34.880
and we're in the phase of the cycle where there is going to be then the cracks occurring and the

10:34.960 --> 10:44.160
negative impact on economic activity and the like. And it's going to be more difficult than normal

10:44.160 --> 10:52.640
because there's so much debt outstanding and what we just talked about. So that is likely

10:53.840 --> 11:02.000
to happen over, let's say, the next year and a half, which means that it will take us

11:02.080 --> 11:08.160
in through the elections. And what we have is a situation where the second of those influences,

11:08.160 --> 11:17.600
the internal conflict influence, is bad and you have a lot of populism. So populists are people

11:17.600 --> 11:25.200
who will fight to win at all costs. They're not compromisers. I will fight and I will win for you

11:25.200 --> 11:34.960
and the rules be damned, compromising be damned. And so you're going to have a political situation

11:34.960 --> 11:40.080
in terms of that kind of environment. It's a bad time for that, but it'll end up

11:40.080 --> 11:48.640
paying an impact on the nature of the elections, I think. And then you have the international

11:48.640 --> 12:02.080
conflict. We are much closer to a big conflict, a war of sorts, either a sanctions and economic war

12:02.080 --> 12:09.760
or even possibly a military war with China. And because of the politics also, that that

12:09.760 --> 12:17.040
will be pushing its limits too because there are the one thing that most Americans are united on

12:17.040 --> 12:27.200
and both Democrats and Republicans are united on is anti-China. And as a result, and they all want

12:27.200 --> 12:35.600
a strong man or woman, strong person on that. And so I think you're going to see pushing of the limits

12:35.600 --> 12:44.720
there and that becomes a dangerous set of circumstances. So I think that if we take the next,

12:45.680 --> 12:51.920
you know, let's call it one, two, three years, I think that those are going to be riskier years.

12:52.640 --> 12:57.120
I spoke to an evolutionary psychologist and an evolutionary anthropologist a little while

12:57.120 --> 13:02.320
ago on the show and they were teaching me about the values and the type of characteristics that

13:02.320 --> 13:08.000
ancestral tribes would have preferred in leaders at different states. And in times of warfare,

13:08.000 --> 13:12.320
more dominant leaders were the ones that were preferred. In times of peace, more prestigious

13:12.320 --> 13:17.840
leaders were the ones that were preferred. Makes complete sense. If you are facing a scary tribe

13:17.840 --> 13:22.400
from the other valley, you want someone that's going to stand firm and is going to not take any

13:22.400 --> 13:27.040
shit and they're going to go for it. When times of peace, that person becomes a bit tyrannical.

13:27.040 --> 13:31.920
It's a little bit too much energy when there's not anybody else to fight. And it's so funny how

13:31.920 --> 13:38.720
you see this just same dynamic to me. It seems play out, no matter how big the populations get,

13:38.720 --> 13:46.720
it's essentially the same physics. That's right. It's happened repeatedly. If you're in a war,

13:46.720 --> 13:55.200
what you want is the commander and everybody to goddamn follow the instructions and just do what

13:55.200 --> 14:02.640
you're told. And it's not like we're going to sit there and argue, debate, and so on. So what you

14:02.640 --> 14:10.880
see is the breakdowns. And particularly, you see the breakdowns also when they're at odds.

14:10.880 --> 14:17.280
There's a lot more to argue about. Like now, the populace of the left and the populace of the right.

14:17.280 --> 14:26.320
And so in the 1930s, you saw four democracies become dictatorships. Choose to become dictatorships.

14:26.320 --> 14:33.680
They had parliaments that chose to become dictatorships. Germany, Italy, Spain, and Japan

14:34.240 --> 14:41.360
chose that because in order to fight, that's what you need. And your anthropologist friends are

14:42.480 --> 14:43.280
right on that.

14:43.280 --> 14:48.320
Yeah, they're consolidating power in an attempt to try and be able to enact more change more easily.

14:48.320 --> 14:52.160
It's not, we haven't got time. We haven't got time to get this across the line diplomatically. We

14:52.160 --> 14:55.200
haven't got time to get everybody on the same page. We'll have one person who knows what they're

14:55.200 --> 14:58.400
doing and they'll push it forward. One thing that I...

14:58.400 --> 15:07.760
And another thing that's common is the foreign enemy. When you have a situation where you have

15:07.760 --> 15:17.680
internal dispute, it's very, very common to try to bring the country together, get support by the

15:17.680 --> 15:27.040
leader by having the common enemy. And so we'll all rally around the leader and you could see...

15:28.480 --> 15:38.160
It was like when 9-11 happened and the president, Bush gets a standing ovation and we're all behind

15:38.160 --> 15:43.920
you in that fight. And so that's timeless and universal dynamic.

15:43.920 --> 15:49.120
If you can't bond yourselves together over shared love of an in-group, shared hatred of an out-group

15:49.120 --> 15:56.320
is a close enough proxy, I suppose, for that interim. Was there anything over the last two years

15:56.320 --> 16:01.760
that you didn't anticipate or is there anything particularly unique about the situation that

16:01.760 --> 16:08.720
we're in now? Every time people say it's going to be different this time. Is there anything that

16:08.720 --> 16:12.160
could make things different this time or is there anything that you've been surprised by?

16:14.400 --> 16:21.040
By and large, I haven't been surprised by... I mean, I didn't anticipate that we were going to have

16:21.040 --> 16:32.320
the war with Russia, but I did anticipate that we were likely headed in a war-like environment.

16:32.320 --> 16:42.160
It's very much fell with as expected there. The economic and the financial very much is the same.

16:42.480 --> 16:52.960
So I'd have to, by and large, almost exactly, it's transpired the way described. And that's why,

16:52.960 --> 17:00.640
again, look, I did the video for free on YouTube, the changing world order.

17:02.560 --> 17:08.640
What I'm trying to do is to just pass it along for people's consideration to understand the

17:08.640 --> 17:15.920
cause-effect relationship that goes there. But yes, it's unfortunately going according to script.

17:15.920 --> 17:23.920
That doesn't mean it's destined, but it's difficult to take off track. What do I mean by that?

17:27.520 --> 17:36.560
Each stage is the logical consequence of the stage that proceeded it. So let's take the

17:36.560 --> 17:47.840
existing situation. The United States has a lot of debt, and it has deficits. So it has to sell

17:47.840 --> 17:55.920
debt. Now, if you say, and others are holding debt, and if you say, how do you get healthy,

17:56.000 --> 18:09.040
you have to spend less than you earn to not borrow money and get financially strong.

18:10.800 --> 18:16.160
That's difficult, and particularly when you have a lot of debt, because you have to take a portion

18:16.160 --> 18:22.320
of your income and you have to pay the debt. And also you're living in spending more than

18:22.320 --> 18:28.320
you're earning. And so how do you rectify that? What? Cut spending? I mean, it's very difficult

18:28.320 --> 18:37.040
to cut spending. Or raise income? That's not easy. So cut spending? What do you cut? Okay.

18:37.040 --> 18:45.440
So we're living in a world now where policymakers don't think, how much money do I have to spend,

18:45.520 --> 18:56.480
and what should I prioritize it on? They think, how much money do I need to spend without regard

18:56.480 --> 19:04.800
to how much they have, and then they go spend it, and then they have deficits that central banks

19:04.800 --> 19:10.480
can print. It's just like the same as individuals. They have the deficit, but in their case,

19:10.480 --> 19:17.120
they have the capacity to print the money to pay the deficit. So it's not easy to fix the financial

19:17.120 --> 19:25.120
problem. The internal problem, you know what it's like. Can you get people to come together

19:25.920 --> 19:33.040
to say there's a common problem? Let's have the left and the right and people. Very difficult.

19:33.040 --> 19:42.080
People have big differences in values and conditions. And so it's very difficult to bring

19:42.080 --> 19:48.560
them together to deal with the problems. And the same is true internationally, you know?

19:48.560 --> 19:58.000
Easier said than done. So given that dynamic, there is then the stages. And so it's pretty clear

19:58.080 --> 20:06.320
normally what comes next. Given all of these changes, what do you think people can do

20:07.040 --> 20:10.720
to best prepare themselves financially for the next few years?

20:11.840 --> 20:25.360
Well, I think that in saving, let's talk about that, there is, I think of savings in

20:25.920 --> 20:34.640
tiers. The first tier is to secure your well-being, tone a portfolio of assets that are going to

20:35.440 --> 20:42.000
secure your well-being. And then after you have that taken care of, then you can go to the next

20:42.000 --> 20:50.720
level, take more risk and so on. That well-being, that purchasing power has to be viewed in terms of

20:50.720 --> 21:00.160
inflation-adjusted dollars. If you're holding a debt instrument and a cash-paying instrument,

21:00.160 --> 21:08.080
and it gives you a 2% interest and you have a 5% or 6% inflation, you lose money at 3% a year.

21:08.080 --> 21:15.680
So you have to look at that in real dollars. And you have to hold that portfolio in a way

21:16.640 --> 21:23.200
that is balanced to any kind of economic environment. And then the way I do it, and I

21:25.200 --> 21:31.920
remember I didn't have anything, and then I start to acquire money. And I start to think,

21:31.920 --> 21:42.800
okay, how many weeks do I have, months do I have, or years that I'm financially safe?

21:42.880 --> 21:48.400
And what do I hold it in? And then once you've got that taken care of, you can go beyond it.

21:49.760 --> 21:58.480
And I wanted it in a very well-balanced portfolio, that type of portfolio that does

21:58.480 --> 22:05.360
equally well, no matter what happens. I can explain that a little bit more if you want.

22:05.760 --> 22:16.480
That'd be good. Okay. There are basically two big influences on markets,

22:20.000 --> 22:31.040
the growth rate and the inflation rate. Like, if you know that growth is going to be

22:32.000 --> 22:38.960
faster than expected, and inflation is going to be higher than expected,

22:39.840 --> 22:48.720
you know that bonds are going to go down and vice versa. So the way I give that as an example,

22:50.960 --> 22:57.360
so the way I look at it is there are those two big influences, and then they can,

22:57.920 --> 23:01.520
four environments, and each one of them can go up or down. So there are four

23:03.360 --> 23:10.160
quadrants that I think of, rising growth, falling growth, rising inflation, and falling inflation.

23:10.960 --> 23:18.000
And I want to have a portfolio that will be 25% of my risk in each one of those,

23:18.640 --> 23:26.080
so that I don't have any bias. And so I pick the assets that are going to do well in each of those

23:26.080 --> 23:34.240
four quadrants, and I hold them in a balanced way. And I've tested that going back actually to 1900

23:34.240 --> 23:43.680
and so on, and you'll actually increase your buying power. And so that's the kind of thing

23:43.680 --> 23:50.560
that I think in the beginning. Then you have to also make provision for taxes to some extent.

23:51.120 --> 23:57.360
So I say whatever that amount of money is, I want twice as that. So in case it goes in half,

23:58.080 --> 24:05.200
and I want to build a portfolio that looks like that for, I don't know, X number of years,

24:05.200 --> 24:11.040
that I have that, and that's the safe savings. And then when I go beyond that, then I'll take

24:11.040 --> 24:18.960
more risk. But I think that being safe, particularly in this kind of an environment,

24:18.960 --> 24:25.600
is important. And I would take a perspective of how to do that. That's like the one I'm just

24:25.600 --> 24:30.880
describing. What would be an example of an investment for each of those four quadrants?

24:31.680 --> 24:37.280
Well, I'm worried that we're going to take a long time to explain it. I've explained it

24:37.520 --> 24:49.840
elsewhere. But let me give an example. I'll take it. If growth, so there's these four quadrants,

24:49.840 --> 24:58.560
growth and inflation. If growth is less than expected, and inflation is less than expected,

24:58.560 --> 25:07.440
you would like to own bonds. If it's higher than expected, you would not want to own bonds.

25:10.720 --> 25:19.920
If inflation is higher than expected, you would want to own assets such as commodities and gold

25:20.240 --> 25:34.560
and inflation index bonds. If growth is faster than expected, particularly if inflation is less

25:34.560 --> 25:41.040
than expected, you'd want to own stocks. So you get the idea.

25:43.600 --> 25:48.960
One of the things that you brought up earlier on was the changing internal structure. This is

25:48.960 --> 25:54.640
driven by a number of factors, but one of them being increasing wealth inequality. At the moment,

25:54.640 --> 26:00.640
it seems like there is a decline in praising work ethic, especially in the US. Do you think that

26:00.640 --> 26:08.000
that is a symptom or a cause of what we're seeing at the moment? Well, I think the,

26:08.480 --> 26:25.760
I'm referring to the wealth gap. I think that there's a lot of particularly unproductive people,

26:27.680 --> 26:34.560
for various reasons. But I live in the state of Connecticut, and my wife tries to help

26:35.520 --> 26:43.680
students in the poorest neighborhoods have the worst conditions. I'll give you this example.

26:47.760 --> 26:52.960
The state of Connecticut is usually number one, two, or three in the richest state in the country,

26:53.600 --> 26:59.840
but 22% out of the last survey, it's actually higher than this, 22% of the high school students

26:59.920 --> 27:06.880
in Connecticut have either dropped out of high school or have absentee rates of greater than

27:06.880 --> 27:16.480
25% in our failing classes. There's a great deal of poverty and the breakup of the families and

27:16.480 --> 27:26.800
the guidance. There's a cycle that takes place. You're seeing the general competitive education

27:26.800 --> 27:35.600
levels, the conditions. In Connecticut, so we operate philanthropically, and I'll give you

27:35.600 --> 27:45.040
an example, there was COVID, and the kids have to get educated, and 60,000 kids didn't have

27:45.040 --> 27:53.040
computers or connectivity, and no government was going to do anything about it. We had to buy

27:53.040 --> 28:01.200
60,000 computers to give it to kids in order for them to have education. Well, and there's hunger,

28:01.200 --> 28:09.360
and there's poverty, and there's drugs. It's how the educational system is funded.

28:10.800 --> 28:18.560
Education is a state issue by the Constitution, and then within a state, it's a tax,

28:18.800 --> 28:25.680
typically within a state, it's a tax district issue. I live in Greenwich, Connecticut, which is

28:25.680 --> 28:35.280
relatively, it's a rich town, and the public education gets about $24,000 per student. The last

28:35.280 --> 28:42.560
number I looked, it's probably higher than that now, gets $24,000 a student up the road at Bridgeport,

28:42.560 --> 28:49.760
Connecticut, 10 minutes up the road, they get $14,000 a student, because there's no tax base,

28:51.840 --> 28:58.640
and they need more money because the expenses of raising a kid are, you also have to get them

28:58.640 --> 29:05.200
the computer, you've got to get them the food, the clothes, all of those things, and they have

29:05.200 --> 29:15.840
less food, less clothes, all those things. But in any case, what you can see is the

29:15.840 --> 29:22.480
education test scores and measures of how we're doing in education relative to other countries

29:23.280 --> 29:34.480
have declined. So part of it is education and circumstances, part of it is drugs, part of it

29:34.480 --> 29:41.440
is, you know, there are lots of parts of it, and then there's a certain element of it, which

29:42.400 --> 29:50.880
let's say because of COVID or other reasons, that people have moved around and say, you know,

29:50.880 --> 29:56.880
I don't have to work as hard anymore. So, you know, just for example, the change in the attitudes

29:56.880 --> 30:04.320
of restaurant workers, you know, okay, I can, I found another way to live and so on, and that's

30:05.120 --> 30:15.520
playing a role. Of course, also, people as the baby boomers are older, you know, they drop out of

30:15.520 --> 30:21.600
it, nor they want to retire earlier, and they do. So there are a number of factors that affect,

30:23.920 --> 30:37.840
you know, this kind of set of circumstances. The wealth gap is very much due to a self-reinforcing

30:37.920 --> 30:46.640
cycle in which if you earn a lot of money, you can't afford to take care of your kids' education,

30:46.640 --> 30:54.800
you can raise them in a better way. If you don't earn a lot of money, you don't have that privilege.

30:54.880 --> 31:07.360
So, you know, so all through history, during those such times, wealth gaps have increased.

31:08.960 --> 31:15.680
So you look at the cycles, you have a new, you know, like a new world order,

31:15.680 --> 31:21.600
like in the 1850s, you know, you have the Civil War, and then you have that, and then you have

31:21.600 --> 31:26.320
new technologies in inventing, you have the Industrial Revolution take place,

31:26.960 --> 31:35.120
and things go great, but what it does is it also increases the wealth gap. Some people make a

31:35.120 --> 31:42.480
lot of money, others don't, and it also increases the level of indebtedness, and you make the turn

31:42.480 --> 31:52.480
of the century, then you see big conflicts over wealth. You have the Panic of 1907, and so what

31:52.480 --> 32:00.800
you see is the Industrial Revolution turns into what's called the Gilded Age, in which there are

32:00.800 --> 32:09.280
very rich, decadent, you know, while there's poverty and, you know, in the early turn of the

32:09.280 --> 32:16.080
century, they're living, people are living very, very lavishly, very decadently at the same time

32:16.640 --> 32:23.200
as their, you know, sweatshops and all of that, and then there's kind of a revolutionary reaction

32:23.200 --> 32:27.440
to that. So these things happen over and over again, for the same reasons.

32:28.320 --> 32:31.760
What would you tell young people then, at the moment? What advice would you give them?

32:32.720 --> 32:48.800
Well, first of all, learn how, say a few things. First, know your nature. Everyone has a different

32:48.800 --> 32:58.480
nature, a way, a pull, what's their pull, toward. I created a personality profile test called

32:58.480 --> 33:05.200
Principles U. I put it online for free, and it tells you a lot about, you know, what your nature is,

33:05.840 --> 33:12.400
and it also shows if you take the test and you put somebody else's in, they take the test,

33:12.400 --> 33:17.680
it'll tell you about your relationship. So you want to know what your nature is, what your pull

33:17.680 --> 33:25.360
is going for, and then you go through your journey of learning experiences that, you know,

33:25.360 --> 33:31.840
has its ups and downs, and, you know, you learn, you have your, you know, your painful experiences,

33:31.840 --> 33:37.920
but have a principle, pain plus reflection equals progress. You learn, you get that.

33:38.640 --> 33:48.640
And then to have perspective, to understand that all of these things, events,

33:48.720 --> 33:56.320
transpire, you know, know the whole cycle, see the whole thing, gain perspective, and understand where

33:56.320 --> 34:03.200
you are in the cycle, understand where you are in the life cycle. There's a life cycle, you know,

34:03.200 --> 34:08.720
from birth to death, and let's say it on average, it lasts about 80 years, and you know that at

34:08.720 --> 34:13.360
different parts in that cycle, certain things are going to happen. You're going to, you know,

34:14.080 --> 34:21.040
first third of it, you're going to be dependent on others and you're learning. Second third of it,

34:22.320 --> 34:26.320
you're going to be independent of your parents and so on, and you're going to be,

34:27.200 --> 34:32.240
others will become dependent on you and you're working to be successful. At the various ages,

34:32.240 --> 34:38.400
you get married, you have kids, you, all of these cycles, there's a life cycle, that happens over

34:38.400 --> 34:45.200
and over again, and then there are these other cycles, these cycles of, you know,

34:47.200 --> 34:56.080
you know, let's call it almost from, from war to war, whether that's an internal war to change

34:56.080 --> 35:01.600
as the internal order or an external war, it changes the external order. And there's a cycle

35:01.600 --> 35:10.800
that has to do with a debt cycle and those others, and you have to know what those cycles are like

35:10.800 --> 35:16.720
and kind of where you are in those cycles, and you navigate it well. I mean, the main thing,

35:16.720 --> 35:22.160
you know, is being strong, smart, capable, and adaptable. But that's why I put out

35:23.600 --> 35:28.800
these, you know, videos and books to try to help people understand that.

35:29.520 --> 35:35.600
You mentioned one of the common life landmarks that people get to is having kids and getting married.

35:36.160 --> 35:41.840
At the moment, especially in the West, but also even more so in Asia, birth rates are falling

35:41.840 --> 35:48.160
through the floor. We've got 0.78, I think in South Korea, we've got just around about one

35:48.160 --> 35:54.720
in Japan, China also looking really bad at the moment. What, how concerned are you about

35:54.720 --> 35:58.480
current population decline and future demographics?

35:59.360 --> 36:07.840
Well, it's a real burden. And also depending on where it is, it's a real burden,

36:08.960 --> 36:16.720
because the young have to take care of the old. So let's say, for example, in China,

36:17.600 --> 36:26.720
with the one child policy, a married couple has four old adults that they have to take care of.

36:26.720 --> 36:35.920
There's not an adequate social program. And that takes time and money. And it makes it,

36:35.920 --> 36:45.440
you know, a great burden makes productivity a problem. And so you see, you know, like you say,

36:45.760 --> 36:54.480
you know, you see this, you know, that that is a, these are burdens, costs, because the,

36:54.480 --> 37:03.520
those who need taking care of and are not earning money need, you know, those resources and it's,

37:03.520 --> 37:14.480
and it's sapping. You know, one hopes that productivity increases faster than this burden.

37:14.480 --> 37:20.560
And that, but then it requires you, you have to, if you raise that, you have to then divide the pie

37:20.560 --> 37:26.240
well. So it's, you know, it's demographics is a burden.

37:27.280 --> 37:35.280
You are maybe alluding there to stuff like AI, robot, robotized workforces assisting in terms

37:35.280 --> 37:42.800
of getting more juice out of the smaller demographics that we do have. And the potential

37:42.800 --> 37:48.880
gains of that accruing to a small number of people that own that organization, you need a

37:48.880 --> 37:53.920
relatively small group to be able to, I don't know how many people are in the open AI company,

37:53.920 --> 37:58.560
but something tells me it's a significantly smaller number than the amount of impact that

37:58.560 --> 38:04.640
it's had and is probably going to have. Right. So that's exactly right. So if you,

38:04.640 --> 38:10.720
if the society as a whole can do that, what it will do is it'll naturally make the people who

38:11.680 --> 38:19.280
some people very rich and some people very poor, but it can raise productivity enough

38:19.280 --> 38:25.120
that it can raise living standards. Let's just imagine robots always work there and you don't

38:25.120 --> 38:31.920
have to have people in doing the jobs. Then what you can have, then what you have to deal with is

38:31.920 --> 38:39.520
how do you redistribute the wealth and opportunity? Because as I say, it'll be concentrated in some

38:39.520 --> 38:48.400
and others will lose jobs and there's more productivity for the whole, but you have a

38:48.400 --> 38:53.040
distribution issue. Are you familiar with Nicholas Eberstadt? Do you know him? He wrote

38:53.040 --> 38:58.320
Men Without Work? No. He came on the show last week. I think he'd be really interested. The

38:58.320 --> 39:05.680
book's very, very short and he's discovered this odd cohort of men that are lurking inside of the

39:05.680 --> 39:12.000
unemployment statistics. There's 7 million men age 22 to 55 in the US who aren't working and

39:12.000 --> 39:19.680
aren't looking for work. Only 10% of that number of students from the remaining 6.7 million.

39:20.240 --> 39:26.320
About 2000 hours is the average amount of time that they spend watching screens and 50% of that

39:26.320 --> 39:32.640
time on average is spent whilst on either prescription medication or weed recreational drugs.

39:33.600 --> 39:39.840
Two thirds of those men are living in homes that claim at least one disability benefit. Basically,

39:39.840 --> 39:45.520
lurking inside of the low unemployment numbers is this cohort of prime working age men who don't

39:45.520 --> 39:53.120
have a job and don't want a job either. One of the potential downstream implications for that

39:53.120 --> 39:59.200
is what does this mean for universal basic income? That if these men are able to be supported by

39:59.280 --> 40:05.680
social welfare, but they're not going out and enacting poetry, staring up at the stars,

40:06.720 --> 40:11.360
speaking their truth forward and dealing with the existential pain of living in a good way,

40:12.160 --> 40:17.040
this doesn't seem like they're flourishing particularly. Given the automation that's

40:17.040 --> 40:19.760
potentially coming down the pike, I wonder what that means.

40:20.480 --> 40:28.400
Well, I think you paint or he paints an accurate picture and obviously it's not good.

40:31.440 --> 40:39.120
As my wife was describing when she was dealing with that population, now it's very common for

40:39.200 --> 40:49.120
kids to come to school high and then they have... What ages? Oh, young ages, 10.

40:52.080 --> 40:56.480
Wow, okay. Well, marijuana is readily available.

40:59.360 --> 41:02.960
And so, yeah, we have a number of these issues.

41:03.920 --> 41:10.640
We've brought China up a couple of times and I think based on what I know about your work,

41:10.640 --> 41:17.600
the conflict between the USA and China as China, the ascending new power that may be overtaking

41:17.600 --> 41:24.640
the USA. However, we do have this perhaps unprecedented demographic collapse that China's

41:24.640 --> 41:28.880
facing. The best predictions that I've seen suggest that it's going to go from about 1.1 to

41:28.880 --> 41:36.080
1.2 billion now to about 650 to 700 million by 2050. So, it's pretty much getting chopped in half.

41:37.440 --> 41:44.400
Does that change the way that the world orders change moving forward?

41:47.200 --> 41:53.600
I think the main thing with China right now is we're on the brink of war with China for various

41:53.600 --> 42:06.800
reasons, like I hope we make it to 2050. So, yeah, the demographics is as I described it.

42:08.320 --> 42:15.680
And by the way, them losing doesn't make us winning just so we're... Look at that.

42:16.240 --> 42:26.000
We hope everyone gets better. And the world economy, we hope everybody has a better way.

42:27.520 --> 42:36.560
Everybody loses in wars. And so, that's their set of circumstances and it'll be what it'll be.

42:37.360 --> 42:43.600
I think the most important thing is how do we deal with our circumstances? How do we become

42:43.600 --> 42:51.040
strong and healthy, financially healthy, productivity healthy and so on. So, yeah,

42:51.040 --> 42:59.680
we could talk about the demographic problem in China, which is just what we talked about before

42:59.680 --> 43:06.240
in terms of just robotics and productivity and all that makeup for that, I don't know. But I really

43:06.960 --> 43:13.600
think we're projecting too much on the outside world. Okay, what do we do with China?

43:13.600 --> 43:20.800
What relevance? Well, we trade with China. We don't have to go to a military war with China.

43:22.400 --> 43:34.480
Why would we? We shouldn't do that. And then if that's the case, what's the problem with them

43:34.480 --> 43:43.520
growing? Okay, it's not very much... Okay, let them grow and invent and let us grow and invent

43:43.520 --> 43:51.040
and share the inventions. That would be good. But the problems that we're facing are pretty much

43:51.040 --> 43:58.480
our own problems, the things we're talking about and the breakdown of infrastructure and all of that.

43:59.040 --> 44:07.280
So, really, I think we should focus on that and maybe their demographics as a big burden

44:07.280 --> 44:14.480
or not. They have other big burdens too. We all do. But let's focus on how we can be as good as we

44:14.480 --> 44:22.640
can be. Yeah, as opposed to presuming that this zero sum game is China finds life harder,

44:22.640 --> 44:29.120
therefore America finds life easier. That doesn't work. Yeah, I understand. You might have seen

44:29.120 --> 44:35.360
the Restrict Act, which was brought up recently. It's lining up a potential ban for different types

44:35.360 --> 44:43.600
of online services. And it seems like one of the potential bases for banning TikTok from America,

44:43.600 --> 44:52.640
which, again, to me, just further embeds this them and us, China is enemy. If we can remove

44:52.640 --> 44:56.720
that influence from the West as much as possible, then we are going to end up in a better situation.

44:58.640 --> 45:00.240
Well, that's the dynamic, yes.

45:02.000 --> 45:07.520
What do you think about the Fed's messaging about this soft landing thing? Is that possible? Like,

45:07.520 --> 45:12.560
historically, I don't think it's really happened. But do they have enough control over the economy

45:12.560 --> 45:21.760
to be able to make this work? The big issue is that a lot of debt was created. A lot of it is

45:21.760 --> 45:33.840
government debt, but it is also corporate to a lesser extent household debt. So if you look at

45:33.840 --> 45:40.880
the Silicon Valley, Valley Bank issue, it's not so much their issue as much as a worldwide issue.

45:41.120 --> 45:53.600
What happened is that what's a bank? A bank takes in deposits, and then it takes that money and it

45:53.600 --> 46:01.440
invests it in things. And so they bought a lot of government bonds that had a higher yield than

46:01.440 --> 46:08.400
they were paying out in the deposits. There's a tightness of monetary policy, and those yields

46:08.400 --> 46:16.720
went up and the bonds went down in value. And then the amount they have to pay out went up in value.

46:17.440 --> 46:26.400
And so they went broke. And that is happening all over. That happens not only through banks.

46:26.400 --> 46:33.760
Banks as a whole did a lot of that. But insurance companies and so on, all around the world,

46:33.840 --> 46:38.240
same sort of thing happened in Europe. Same sort of thing happened with Japanese

46:39.280 --> 46:49.440
companies even buying US dollar bonds a lot. And so if you were to mark those to market,

46:50.400 --> 46:59.920
you would have a terrible calamity. But what's going to likely happen is they don't want any

46:59.920 --> 47:07.440
more of those bonds. And we're going to have to sell more bonds because we're going to have a deficit.

47:08.000 --> 47:15.520
So when you have a deficit, you have to pay for it through selling debt. And there's a lesser

47:15.520 --> 47:23.840
demand for that debt. And I think that that creates a problem in which either interest rates

47:23.840 --> 47:28.400
go up or the Federal Reserve's got to come in and print. And this is a problem that exists

47:28.400 --> 47:36.080
also in Europe with the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, all of them. So that's where

47:36.080 --> 47:45.360
we are. And it has knock on effects. It's like dominoes that fall. So it will produce less credit.

47:46.480 --> 47:53.840
And as it produces less credit, less demand, less credit, that'll produce less spending.

47:53.840 --> 47:59.360
It'll come in certain parts of the economy. For example, commercial real estate.

48:01.360 --> 48:13.760
For example, venture capital and private equity. For example, low grade bonds where they have a

48:13.760 --> 48:20.400
heavily indebted company and the interest rate goes up a lot and that causes problems. So I think

48:20.400 --> 48:27.360
you're in the part of the cycle where you've had the tightening and then the dominoes are beginning

48:27.360 --> 48:36.000
to fall. And I think that that's going to produce more problems. So I think when it comes down to

48:36.000 --> 48:42.400
it, there's just too much debt and we're adding it to it too quickly. And so it's going to,

48:44.000 --> 48:49.600
either that debt will be paid off with hard money, in which case there's not much printing

48:49.600 --> 48:57.040
and so on, or it'll be paid off with printing a lot of money to make it easier to pay off.

48:57.040 --> 49:03.520
I think in the end, it's always the case that they print a lot of money in and make it easier

49:03.520 --> 49:09.440
to pay off, but you have the reduced value of money. So that's how it looks to me. You'll have

49:09.440 --> 49:16.800
probably a stagflation environment. And because you have that dynamic going on at the same time

49:16.800 --> 49:21.120
as you have supply chain disruptions because of the geopolitical,

49:22.400 --> 49:24.400
I think it's going to be a difficult environment.

49:26.960 --> 49:34.400
Let's say that we do hit quite an aggressive recession. What are some of the ways that people

49:34.400 --> 49:40.480
could even look to benefit financially from that happening? Are there any things that individuals

49:40.480 --> 49:50.720
can do? The most important thing, as I say, is to have this basic, well-diversified.

49:51.680 --> 49:59.200
And there are some assets and think about a small percentage of your money,

49:59.840 --> 50:09.040
even in asset like gold, and diversification for countries to just to create a diversified

50:09.280 --> 50:15.840
portfolio is important. One of the things that did occur, you mentioned Silicon Valley Bank there,

50:15.840 --> 50:21.040
there was a big bump in terms of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies around about that time.

50:21.040 --> 50:26.320
And it seemed like one of the first periods where people genuinely saw crypto as a store of value,

50:26.320 --> 50:33.120
as a way to just, I need to put my money somewhere that I feel is safe. And given the last 18 months

50:33.120 --> 50:39.200
of what's happened with crypto, considering that as that's the place I'm going to store my assets

50:39.200 --> 50:45.920
in order for it to be safe, I think said quite a lot about how people sort of perceived the

50:45.920 --> 50:51.840
state of the dollar and the security of banks and stuff at the moment. What's the role of

50:51.840 --> 50:55.840
Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in the current economy in your eyes?

50:55.840 --> 51:08.960
I think cryptocurrency or Bitcoin doesn't move in a reliable way related to almost anything.

51:09.600 --> 51:20.720
It moves up and down because of this mood and that mood. And unlike gold, let's say,

51:20.960 --> 51:26.000
I would prefer gold and I would prefer crypto for various reasons. Crypto,

51:28.640 --> 51:35.200
it's very easy to track the owners and transactions in it. It's not liked by the government.

51:40.080 --> 51:47.840
It doesn't move in a way that's consistent with any of the environments. And it's a fairly small

51:47.920 --> 51:58.080
asset class. We talk a lot more about it, but its size is about 30% of the size of Microsoft.

51:58.080 --> 52:05.360
And Microsoft is one stock among many stocks. So it's given probably a lot more attention.

52:06.880 --> 52:14.400
I don't know who knows. Maybe there's some element of it. I don't understand why people

52:14.400 --> 52:22.800
are more inclined to go to Bitcoin than gold. If you look internationally,

52:23.840 --> 52:32.000
gold is, for central banks, the third highest reserve asset. First is dollars, then euros,

52:32.000 --> 52:40.800
then gold, then Japanese yen. And central bankers are buying gold and they're not buying bonds.

52:41.520 --> 52:56.000
And it's timeless and universal. It's been there. So I'm not a big fan of it. As I said before,

52:57.440 --> 53:02.320
having a little bit, I have a little bit of it. But if you have a little bit of it, you have to

53:03.440 --> 53:09.680
think about those things. And like I said, you have to be prepared for it to fall a lot.

53:10.480 --> 53:16.000
If it goes down 80% or something, but that limits the amount that you can have in it.

53:16.000 --> 53:20.240
So I don't know. I don't think a lot of Bitcoin.

53:21.040 --> 53:27.520
I think what's interesting there is holding crypto essentially has a cognitive load on you,

53:28.640 --> 53:33.680
using it as somewhere that you're using for investment as a store of value to just put

53:33.680 --> 53:39.120
assets that you've got. There is a price that you pay because of the volatility,

53:39.120 --> 53:42.960
but the price that you pay is with your own sanity with regards to that,

53:43.840 --> 53:51.840
which is something that I hadn't quite considered. There are less sanity sapping forms of investment.

53:51.840 --> 53:59.200
Yeah, that's a good way to do it. I mean, I've seen so many people. I've seen people get very

53:59.200 --> 54:03.280
rich and I've seen people get very broke with it. I have friends in both camps.

54:03.360 --> 54:11.200
Yeah. So we've spoken about today this very quickly changing highly volatile environment that we're

54:11.200 --> 54:16.400
in, whether that be socioculturally, politically, globally, locally, financially.

54:19.440 --> 54:28.000
Where should people go in order to find some solace in this, given the fact that it is

54:28.960 --> 54:41.120
difficult to exist in this world? Go to places or spend time where there's not as much of this

54:41.920 --> 54:50.320
junk going on. I mean, first of all, I think recognize, let's go to some of the basics.

54:50.560 --> 54:59.120
What do you really need? You need a bed to sleep in. You need food to eat.

55:02.160 --> 55:10.000
Most depressions, most people remain employed. Most wars, most people don't get

55:10.640 --> 55:24.720
die or get injured. So let's calm down and put all this in place. Let's be in places where there's

55:27.440 --> 55:34.240
goodness and harmony and beauty. Maybe you spend more time in nature or you go out there and

55:34.640 --> 55:47.040
meditate. Meditation has had a big effect on me. So don't get all stressed about it.

55:48.240 --> 55:59.840
Navigate it well. Enjoy life, enjoy those things. I think that's most important.

56:00.400 --> 56:03.920
What would you say to the people that say, how am I expected to enjoy life when there's

56:03.920 --> 56:08.960
all of this chaos going on? There's so many bad news stories and headlines. What about the financial

56:08.960 --> 56:19.600
collapse? Well, first of all, if it's really having that impact on you, don't get so hung up on the

56:19.600 --> 56:27.360
financial stories. Don't watch the television or something. Go out for a nice walk in the nature,

56:27.760 --> 56:35.520
all that story. You don't really need all that story. Now what's going to happen to you, like I

56:35.520 --> 56:43.360
say? Don't get so hung up on expectations of having the most amount of money or whatever. Just

56:44.240 --> 56:56.400
think about it. Like I say, will you lose where you live? What matters? Your friends, your family,

56:57.360 --> 57:03.920
your, give a good bed to sleep in for adequate food, make out into nature.

57:05.920 --> 57:13.440
My own view is sometimes the most luxurious thing I can do is take a tent and be out in a beautiful

57:13.440 --> 57:27.520
spot. Avoid it. Don't get stressed out. Understand it. Be prepared.

57:30.720 --> 57:35.120
Redefining success and what happiness means and what we should be aiming for in life,

57:35.120 --> 57:39.520
I think is a very worthwhile pursuit. Right. I'll tell you,

57:42.960 --> 57:52.720
this idea of success being measured in the amount of money and status you have is really screwed up.

57:55.520 --> 58:02.320
Like if you think about money, and this is shown in Measures of Happiness,

58:03.280 --> 58:10.640
past a basic amount of money so that you don't have the misery, there is no correlation between

58:10.640 --> 58:15.520
the level of money you have and the level of happiness you have. Lots of studies show that.

58:16.240 --> 58:23.360
And the highest correlation is do you have a community? That's the highest source of

58:25.600 --> 58:30.880
happiness and also longevity. It has a big effect on longevity, stress.

58:30.880 --> 58:35.120
More than smoking, more than stopping alcohol, more than going to the gym and exercising.

58:35.120 --> 58:46.000
Right. And then you think what is money for? It has no intrinsic value. It only has a value of

58:46.000 --> 58:56.240
what it buys. And so it has a limited marginal ability, benefit. You add more and more to it.

58:57.120 --> 59:02.160
And like what are you going to do? Okay, so you're going to get a bigger house or a bigger car?

59:04.960 --> 59:11.040
And what does that really mean incrementally relative to spending time with friends and

59:11.040 --> 59:18.000
family and all of those things? Most of the good things in life are not expensive. Right.

59:18.720 --> 59:28.160
Friends, family, nature, sex, anything. It's not going to get better with more money,

59:28.160 --> 59:36.400
right, materially better. And so it seems to me that it then can become an obsession

59:38.480 --> 59:45.760
and that's not healthy. So I think it's by and large you handle it well and it's

59:45.760 --> 59:50.240
all going to be okay. It's all going to be okay.

59:52.400 --> 59:56.000
Ray Dalio, ladies and gentlemen, if people want to keep up to date with the work that you're

59:56.000 --> 01:00:05.920
doing, why should they go? My more lengthy writings are on LinkedIn, but I'm on all of the social

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:15.600
media. So in various ways and if I write something that's longer, it'll be linked to

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:22.320
LinkedIn. So all the major social media I'm on. Ray, I really appreciate you. Thank you for today.

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:27.360
