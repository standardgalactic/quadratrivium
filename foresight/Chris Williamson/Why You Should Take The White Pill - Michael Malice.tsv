0	6560	We can't imagine what it's like as Westerners to live in a country where every aspect of your life
6560	10560	has to be run through a politically correct filter. People here complain about wokeism,
10560	14480	or they hate Trump, and we can sit here and talk about how much we hate Trump, or we hate
14480	19040	wokeism, whatever, and there's no consequences. But to live in a country where even your friends
19040	22880	are turning and spying on you, and you have to watch what you say, and at work everything's
22880	28080	in this context, and every movie, every song, every TV show, every newspaper, how it encompasses
28160	30640	and affects you, we can't wrap our heads around it.
34400	37360	Michael Malis, look at this show. I'm so nervous. Why?
37920	41120	Kidding idiot. Is it because of all of the cameras and lights?
41120	45040	Yeah, yes. I'll be gentle with you. I don't want gentle.
45040	49840	Yeah, I've heard that. So, you were about to have an argument with me. Are you
49840	53280	planned to have a potential argument? No, no, I had an imaginary argument.
53280	56480	Okay. So, do you ever get an imaginary argument with your friends?
56480	57920	Oh, yeah, I fantasize about them all the time.
59920	65440	So, this was the imaginary argument. I've been working on this book as long as we've been friends,
66640	71520	two and a half years, as you would say, and you texted me over the weekend about Louis Ling,
72080	77360	right? And he's chapter two, and I'm like, this can I curse?
77920	78880	Curse away?
78880	81200	This Brit, this bloody Brit.
81200	82960	That's the worst word that you could have used.
83440	89760	I could have called you an Irishman. This bloody Brit has had all this time to read this book.
89760	93520	He's not going to have it done for the interview. He's just going to talk about it
93520	98160	cursorily when he knows how much I worked on it and how much it meant to me and how much I wanted
98160	103920	to hear his perspective as an Englishman because Lady Thatcher is on the cover and she's a main
103920	110320	figure in the book. And I was all prepared to come in Huffin and Puffin and Chris did his homework.
110320	114480	I'm afraid that there's nothing for you to huff and puff about. So, that was resurfaced by
114480	119520	Readwise, which is a highlighting. So, it had given it back to me because it's a relatively
119520	124480	new recent highlight. Now, the Louis Ling thing, it turns out I actually did miss him because
124480	129840	he was on the front cover of a previous book. So, maybe I have missed him once already. But
130560	137680	my head is in a little bit of a spin because for all the everybody that's smart seems to talk about
137760	142800	the Soviet Union and lessons that come out of communism. Lots of people,
143600	148080	the Lexis and the Peterson's of the world or whatever, seem to draw a lot of lessons from this.
149440	154160	I frankly didn't know much about it. If you'd held a gun to my head and said,
154160	160560	tell me when the Berlin Wall fell or tell me who the main characters were in the decline of
160560	166800	communism between the UK, America and the Soviet Union, I wouldn't have known. So, it has been
166800	174720	a little bit like a fast track education through some pretty brutal elements of history.
175520	180640	I didn't know it either. When I sat down to write this, I didn't know any of it. I didn't know
181280	187920	why it was such a big deal that the Berlin Wall fell and what that meant. I knew in a,
187920	190720	I was born in the Soviet Union, but I left when I was like one and a half. So, obviously I don't
190720	195840	remember it in any sense. And though we were raised in my household with kind of Soviet
195840	203760	inspired values for lack of better term, I still had no good idea of what it meant when it fell,
203760	210160	how bad it was, what are the lessons, none of that. And I still don't have a good answer
211120	219760	as to why the Cold War, which was the absolute primary foreign policy concern for over half
219840	227360	a century for the West is like forgotten. I don't, I don't know how to reconcile those two things
227360	232880	because starting from, you know, very quickly after the end of World War II, up through 91,
233520	240320	all foreign policy, whether in Britain, Germany, West Germany, the US, this was the filter. This
240320	244560	was the big concern. Is this person, how is this person going to address the Cold War if you're
244560	250560	talking about a prime minister or a chancellor or a president? And if you ask people who Brezhnev is,
250560	256720	right, who ran the Soviet Union for close to 20 years, what percent of educated, well-read people,
256720	262960	not people who are a little older than us will know, know who he is. It's, it's a tiny percentage.
262960	272800	And so when writing this, I still don't have an understanding as to why it kind of fell on my
272800	277040	shoulders, because this isn't some hipster band that you probably haven't heard of.
278000	283840	This was the Cold War. And yet now, if you talk about it, they're like, oh, yeah,
283840	289360	wasn't that on like Labrador Records? Kitchy history type thing. Yeah. And it's like, this is
289360	297840	millions of people in many countries over decades suffering things that all of us listening to this
297840	302720	and everyone listening to this is in at least a semi-free country would find unimaginable.
302720	307680	Just the, just even the one aspect of the idea of knowing that whenever you're on the phone,
307680	313680	it's tapped, how that would affect your phone calls. Now, you know, we have that here in the
313680	320000	sense of the NSA, but not to the extent where like, if I'm texting you and I'm making a joke about
320000	326960	Trump or Biden, I have to worry, not in the middle of the night, am I going to get fired?
326960	331520	Am I just going to get sat and be sat down by, you know, the authorities and be like,
331520	335520	what did this email mean? How do you know Chris? Who else have you talked about these
335520	340400	things with Chris? And have no, I can't complain to anyone, because if I'm complaining, I'm only
340400	344560	going to make it worse. We can wrap our heads around what that kind of lifestyle is like.
344560	351520	And this was the norm for a lot of people. And that's even the easiest part to deal with.
351520	356640	You know, you just don't talk politics, but the rest of it, you know, it's just was so
356640	365280	pervasive and extensive and for so long and for so many people. And I don't understand how this,
365280	370560	you know, the New York Times has the 1619 project, which focuses on things which we can all agree are
371200	376480	a major historic concern, you know, the slave trade, you know, is obviously, you know, historical
376480	382080	abomination. So the subject matter at least is important, even if there's spin on it, you know,
382080	387200	is a certain skew. But this is something that's just not discussed. And I can't,
387200	392320	I don't even have a hypothesis as to, I know I do have a hypothesis. The hypothesis is,
392320	397920	there's not an easy narrative, right? I had to find this narrative. It's not an easy story of,
398480	402480	you know, it's okay, they're the bad guys, but then why are we teaming up with them in World War
402480	407360	II? And who are the good guys? Are they Reagan? But is it really Reagan and Thatcher? Because,
407360	411600	you know, they weren't entirely the heroes in the eyes of the press. So when you don't have,
411600	415040	like the Vietnam war is another, or the Korean war is called the Forgotten War because it was a
415040	419680	stalemate, right? So since there's no narrative and you can't make it into Hollywood where it's
419680	424560	like good wins over evil, they just stop talking about it. And when you stop talking about it,
424560	432160	you're ignoring what happened to untold numbers of men, women and children who had to suffer
432160	437200	needlessly and who are now being forgotten. And I'm like, I'm going to do something about that.
437200	439920	The complexity of the truth is inconvenient for both sides.
439920	446480	Yes. Yes. Yes. Yeah. So I'm going to try and do my best to summarize
447440	451680	what I think is the reason or the message behind the book, because a good bit of it is
453760	460480	repeatedly being stamped in the face by these very, very uncomfortable, brutal
462160	468640	situations that many people across Romania, Ukraine, but largely in the Soviet Union,
468640	475040	Russia especially, is that they're dealing with. But it's a book that's supposed to be about good
475040	481360	as well, right? It's about good and evil. And it kind of does take a little while for me to
481360	486000	get to the stage where I was like, oh, I kind of understand here. It seems to me that you have an
486000	493360	issue with cynicism being used and weaponized as a reason for people to not have hope.
494320	500800	What you have done is displayed some of the most egregious transgressions of humanity
500800	508320	from recent history. Very recent. This isn't World War One. Since World War One.
508960	516960	Almost exclusively since World War One in 1917, right? Yes. So you've tried to put out front,
516960	521920	this is how depraved and awful and disgusting human existence can become.
523440	528400	And yet it didn't win. Yes. And yet people said that it would never be defeated.
529040	534000	And yet it happened essentially overnight from everything to nothing in the space of no time
534000	540960	at all, which means that when we are facing struggles in future, that degree of hope
541760	545600	should be something that should be continued forward, given that life right now is not as
545600	549440	bad as it was then. So the delta between where we want it to be and where it is,
549440	555280	isn't as big to leap. How far am I off? I think you said it better than I could have.
555280	560000	I would not change one word of that other than maybe delta because people won't get that reference.
560720	565760	And I'm being only a little glib. I think you articulated it perfectly. In one case,
565760	573840	it was literally overnight. When Helmut Kohl, who was the chancellor of West Germany,
573840	581600	he's in Poland with Lech Walesa. And you know, telling this, it's just, this is a very emotional
582400	588640	book for me because when you see the photos of these people and their kids, and you know,
588640	594320	there were times when the people in charge were ready to start shooting them. And someone else was
594320	597840	like, we're not shooting them. And you see these children, it's just like, you know,
597840	601600	it's like, hear these stories of like, I think it was Seth MacFarlane who had a ticket on 9-11,
601600	604960	and he like missed his flight. And he has, I think that ticket framed in his house,
604960	609520	like a plane ticket. It's just like, you know, it's just terrifying when you realize this wasn't
610080	616080	hypothetical. Tiananmen Square was June 4th, 1989. So that year, 1989, when shit's hitting the fan,
616720	621200	you know, East Germany, they're like, we want another Tiananmen Square. And they put the guns in
621200	627040	the hands of the military, they gave them the bullets, they were ready. So you had Helmut Kohl
627040	631840	in Poland with Lech Walesa, who was the head of solidarity and kind of the main figure in
631840	636640	liberating Poland from communist rule. And Lech Walesa says to him, you know, I don't think the
636640	641840	Berlin Wall is going to be around much longer. I think it's going to be like a matter of some,
641920	647440	a few months. And Helmut Kohl laughs in his face. He laughs in his face, like Walesa was,
647440	652000	I believe, 46. Helmut Kohl, I think was 60 or something like that. And he goes, look,
652800	658400	you're young. You don't understand how these things work. They take a long time. It was like
658400	663920	patting him on the head, the head of Poland. And it fell the next day, the Berlin Wall,
663920	669680	the next day. And Helmut Kohl literally says, there were so many quotes in this that I found
669680	673680	that I was just like, I kept, if this was in a movie, it would be ridiculous writing.
673680	679440	And Helmut Kohl says, I met the wrong party and it gets on a plane and gets his ass out of Poland.
680000	684000	And what else is just great with the fall of the Berlin Wall, I know we're spoiling to the good
684000	691600	parts, is no one even bothered to call Gorbachev, right? So, you know, East Germany is heavily
691600	696160	backed by the Soviet Union. It was kind of a Soviet satellite state as part of the Warsaw Pact,
696160	700160	which was based on the counterweight to NATO. All these countries agreed to have mutual defense.
701600	708960	And Gorbachev wakes up, you know, in Moscow, and there's people dancing on top of the Berlin Wall,
708960	713840	and no one bothered to call him or let him know. And you could only imagine what's going on in his
713840	717440	head. You know, it's just seeing that. But it was the same thing that was going on the head of people
717440	724480	all over the world, because the Berlin Wall for so long was, you know, imprisoning half of a city
724480	732080	or three quarters of a city, in a sense. People were shot, children were killed in prison for
732080	738400	trying to cross it. And then, you know, they're just drunk and blasting their stereos, you know,
738400	747280	to have this thing literally overnight go from a symbol of imprisonment, torture, oppression
747280	753360	to the biggest party on earth is something that I think even now it's hard for us to
753840	754720	wrap our heads around.
755280	759360	Going back to the cynicism thing, why do you think it is that it's so prevalent? Because it's
759360	764240	something that both of us, I think, rail against. Both of us have a particular distaste for people
764240	770640	that are unreasonably cynical. And it's part of the reason that I ended up moving countries
770640	776160	in an attempt to try and be around people who are less cynical. What is it that's so alluring
776160	777920	about that cynical mindset?
779040	785840	I don't know what I hate more than cynicism. You know, maybe like, you know, literal totalitarianism,
785840	790320	but in terms of personality, I don't know what I hate more and what I'm more against, because
791840	799520	it's such an absurd premise that's so easily disprovable. Cynicism, as I understand it, not in
799520	807520	the Greek philosophical sense, but this idea that like, everything sucks, or, you know,
807520	812640	don't get your hopes up, it's not going to work out. As long as you have one counter example,
812640	817520	the thesis is disproven. And you're telling me that like, and like, if people are like,
820400	828560	you know, I agree that most comedians suck. I agree that most movies suck. I agree that most
828640	832240	books suck. I agree that most podcasts suck, especially mine.
833440	839280	None of them. Not one. There's no book that you read that you're a better person having read it.
839280	844480	There's no movie you've seen where you're like, holy crap, I feel like I'm watching something
844480	850080	from heaven. There's no song that you've ever heard that even when you hear it for the 20th
850080	858000	time, it shakes your soul. None. And if you're that kind of person, that's on you. That means you
858000	866720	are somehow guarded or damaged or something within. And I think there is an enormous amount of pressure.
867840	870720	And from what you and I have talked about, it's, I guess, more prevalent in British
870720	876560	culture than America. But there is a lot of pressure of, you know, kind of just head down,
877520	882480	go to the factory, do the work, don't hope for anything better. And it's just like,
882800	891920	you don't have to become a king or a president or a CEO to improve, right? Not everyone has to be
891920	899920	a fitness model to be in better shape, right? If you're someone who's 400 pounds, you can get
899920	906080	down to 250. You're still a big dude. But think how much healthier you are, your clothes, mobility,
906080	911520	walking up the stairs, quality of life in every way. Is that such an unreasonable goal? But for
912240	916640	a cynic, it's like, what's the point? You're still fat. Well, yeah, you are, but come on,
916640	923680	these are extremely different qualities of life. So I think it is a very non-rational,
925280	934080	emotional perspective that tries to present itself as if it's realistic and cool-headed.
934080	939920	It's like, oh, you're naive, you're a Pollyanna. And like you pointed out, the point this book is,
940800	946800	I'm not being hopeful in the sense of nothing bad happens. I'm not being hopeful in the sense of
947600	954560	the bad guys aren't really that bad. The extent of the depravity, I was on my buddy Dave Smith,
954560	958320	he's a very failed comedian, his podcast. And he goes, if you read 90% of this book,
958320	961280	you think it's the black pill. Correct. Because you're reading it and you're like-
961280	964880	That's what I mean. I was like, okay, chapter 10, it was still not here.
964960	969920	And I just one example off the top of my head, I hope I get through without my voice breaking,
969920	977280	because I still read it and it just haunts me to my core. Early in the 1920s, there are these
977280	982160	children who were homeless in Moscow. And they were thieves, pickpockets. You're a kid living
982160	986880	on the streets, you've got to make do. So the Chekha come, the secret police round them up,
987440	991920	and they take them to the cellar of the prison, and they start beating them and torturing them,
992560	997440	and making them who you're working with, who are your colleagues, whatever the term they used,
997440	1002800	right? In your gang. They're kids, they don't- So they take them in the car, and they drive
1002800	1006320	around, they go point out who you're- And at that point, you're like, yeah, him, him, him.
1006320	1011840	You know, anyone. And then they took them back and they kept beating them. And you hear the
1011840	1017440	other prisoners, like the adults, hearing these kids, these kids screaming. And these adult criminals
1017440	1020720	are like, they were losing their minds just hearing the screams. The children, as the children
1020720	1026240	realized, they were being returned to the cellar. So when you hear about the- So there's no
1027040	1032960	whitewashing in this book of how bad it gets. You know, but people have this idea that, like,
1032960	1038000	there's no point in fighting because, you know, it's inevitable that the bad guys are going to win.
1038000	1044000	But they haven't, you know, like, I'm here, if Hitler had his way, I'd be dead. If Hitler had
1044000	1048080	his way, you'd be dead, right? Like, you know, Britain was standing alone against Hitler for
1048080	1052720	quite a while. Or you'd be a slave. I don't know what you'd be, whatever. Point being,
1052720	1058640	you know, this insistence that villainy always- Why is it, you know, this is the line I had,
1058640	1063120	you know, when I think about this book, why is it that the bad guys always get what they want?
1063120	1066800	Well, I can't get what I want once. And when you put in those terms, it's like, yeah, you're right.
1066800	1072560	And even if I can't, what, I'm just going to be like, eh, too bad. So I don't think it's a coherent
1072960	1080720	worldview. I think it's a very emotional response coached in the mask of rationality
1081280	1084640	and realism. And I don't think it's realistic at all.
1085600	1092080	It's able to give people, it's a much more sort of pedestalized position to be in, right? If you
1092080	1096480	say that everything's going to be bad, it feels like a well-researched. The critic always feels
1096480	1100400	like the guy that's well-researched, right? As opposed to the person that's hopeful.
1101040	1106160	Because the person that's hopeful that things don't happen have... And maybe this is actually
1106160	1110720	reflected in terms of our neurochemistry. Andrew Huebman taught me about this thing
1110720	1113600	where if you tell someone that a movie is going to be really, really good,
1114160	1119520	their dopamine release, even if it's as good as they expect it to be, is less. And if the movie is
1119520	1125280	less good than they expected it to be, then they lose even more. So what you're doing is by being
1125280	1132160	the cynic, you're saving yourself from ever being the person that overpromises. So maybe reality
1132160	1136480	does deliver the world better than you'd hoped. Well, brilliant. That's a bonus for you. And,
1136480	1139200	oh, well, you know, I'm just trying to keep everybody's feet on the ground. That seems like
1139200	1147120	a noble cause, right? So you named each of the different chapters, most of the chapters, up until
1147120	1152080	toward the end, after this famous Einrand speech or passage from a speech that she gave.
1152800	1156800	Why, what's so special to you about that particular speech?
1159440	1165680	So there's a... In Prague, there's a museum of communism. And I visited there when I was in Prague
1166240	1172960	several years ago. And I remember the captions on the different exhibits were worded in a very kind
1172960	1179200	of idiosyncratic way. Because in a Western museum, you would have it be kind of scholarly,
1179920	1182640	you know, even the Holocaust Museum, it's going to be kind of...
1182640	1183520	This is what it is.
1183520	1188640	Yeah. Yeah. Very kind of emotionless matter of fact. And I remembered that in this museum of
1188640	1194000	communism, because, you know, the Czechs were under the boot of the Soviet Union for many decades,
1194000	1198880	it's like, according to, you know, this ideology, we would all have food. But in reality, and thanks to
1198880	1203360	their demented reality, this demented reality, we were all starving. And there was one caption,
1203360	1207040	where they talk about how, you know, how like on the side of a pack of cigarettes, it says,
1207040	1210560	you know, smoking this will be dangerous to your health. Well, in the same way,
1210560	1214560	living in a communist country will be dangerous to your health. So it was very much like this kind
1214560	1220160	of FU. And I sent my protege tray was in Prague recently. I go, can you... Because I'm like,
1220880	1224800	can you take me photos of the captions? And he went through it, send them all. And this was,
1224800	1230800	you know, over this past summer. And it was really a gut punch. And this was after the book was
1230800	1239840	largely done. Because that was the first moment when I realized to what extent it encompasses every
1239840	1248400	aspect of the people living these countries lives. You know, think, we can't imagine what it's like
1248400	1254880	as Westerners to live in a country where every aspect of your life has to be run through a
1254880	1259360	politically correct filter. Now, people here complain about wokeism or they hate Trump.
1259440	1264160	But you can go to the sports game. You can watch some shoot them up movie, you know,
1264160	1267840	Jerry Bruckheimer movie or something stupid. You can watch How I Met Your Mother. There's
1267840	1273920	nothing political about it. It's just... And we can sit here and talk about how much we hate Trump
1273920	1278800	or we hate wokeism, whatever. And there's no consequences. But to live in a country where
1278800	1283680	even your friends are turning and spying on you and you have to watch what you say.
1284160	1289120	And at work, everything's in this context and every movie, every song, every TV show,
1289120	1295120	every newspaper, how it encompasses and affects you, it's... We can't wrap our heads around it.
1295120	1301120	And, you know, so Rand was testifying in 1947 in front of the House and American Activist Committee
1301120	1308720	and she was the only person testifying the only witness who had lived in the Soviet Union.
1309280	1314400	And the Congress people were pushing back at her because they were just like...
1314400	1320320	Because what she was saying to them was fantastical to them because they were of this idea that like,
1320320	1324400	you know, we have it one way, you know, the Russians have it a different way,
1324400	1329600	but people are all pretty much the same all around the world, which is true, you know, to that extent.
1330240	1334960	And this congressman from Pennsylvania goes like, don't they like have picnics and visit their
1334960	1340960	mother-in-law? And you could sense the exasperation, her voice, and she says the quote, which is on
1340960	1345440	the back of the book, where she goes, look, it's almost impossible to convey to a free people
1345440	1349680	what it's like to live in a totalitarian dictatorship. She's like, I can give you a lot
1349680	1354080	of details, I can never completely convince you because you're free. And she breaks down,
1354080	1358720	like, just try to imagine you're in constant terror from morning till night and at night,
1358720	1362560	you're waiting for the doorbell to ring, where you live in a country where human life means
1362560	1367520	nothing, less than nothing, and you know it, where you don't know who's going to do what to you when
1367520	1374640	because there's no rights or law of any kind. And this sense, which I grew up with to some
1374640	1380640	extent, it was kind of passively fed into me. You've told me about what's that concern that you
1380640	1384000	have, you sometimes worry about giving people pieces of information because how are they used
1384000	1388400	against you? Yeah, you run the filter in your head, like the sense of never being entirely safe
1389360	1397360	is something that I don't think Americans, thank God, can wrap their heads around.
1397360	1402240	Because they think, I think in so far, emotionally, you can kind of get to the point where, you know,
1402240	1405920	you go to school and they're teaching you lies and then use favors of full lies,
1405920	1411360	and then the movies are full of propaganda. So we can kind of get to that. But in the sense of like,
1411360	1419200	there's nowhere else to go. We can't really appreciate what that's like. So that kind of was
1420000	1426720	the theme, you know, trying my best. And again, I also can't, I've been to North Korea, but
1426720	1432320	it's one thing to, beautiful country wouldn't want to live there. It's one thing to visit,
1432320	1437360	because I knew I could get my ass out, right? It's another thing to be like, this is the entirety
1437360	1443600	of my reality from the day I'm born to the day I'm going to die. And there's no alternative to this.
1444240	1449840	And, you know, just how pervasive that is, I don't think any of us know what that's like to
1449840	1456480	have a life that is effectively without choice our entire lives. It's the difference between
1456480	1462240	being homeless or going camping. Yeah. Yeah, but, you know, even with homelessness,
1462240	1466640	it's what if you're homeless and everyone else is homeless? That I mean, that's the difference.
1466640	1471600	Because when you're homeless, you used to have a home, you could still have a shelter,
1472240	1478240	you know, there's ways to change your environment. But yeah, I think that's a good way of putting it.
1478800	1484560	Given the atrocities that occurred throughout all of the 1900s under communism,
1485360	1490560	how the fuck did people not foresee the issues that were going to occur?
1490640	1496240	Well, is it only obvious in retrospect?
1497680	1504320	I think that's a great question. How did they not foresee? I think a lot of people did foresee it.
1505280	1510800	Mikhail Bakunin, who was Marx's big rival, he had an essay from 1867,
1510800	1515440	which is in the anarchist handbook, and he just dissects Marxism and you read it and you're like,
1515440	1518880	this guy not only predicted the Soviet Union, he predicted the problems of the Soviet Union.
1519680	1523600	Very prophetic. And the quote that if I could sum it up in one sentence,
1523600	1528480	it's his quote where he says, if the people are being beaten by a stick,
1529120	1532320	they're not much more mollified if it's called the people stick.
1533200	1539680	So when you have the, and even if you, the argument was, this is going to be temporary,
1539680	1544160	right? We're going to have this kind of oppressive dictatorship, the proletariat,
1544160	1549200	we're going to purge these evil elements from our society. And once that's done,
1549200	1554960	and everyone's working for the sake of everybody else, and the parasites are kind of destroyed,
1558240	1562800	my hard work is not going to be going towards Carnegie and having an eighth mansion for him.
1562800	1569120	It's going to be going towards the people. I'm going to work less. There is a kind of coherence
1569120	1573840	to it. In the course of time, these methods will be abolished when they've become unnecessary.
1573920	1579520	Yeah. Yeah. And you know, Emma Goldman, who's on the cover, she sat down with Lenin and she's like,
1579520	1583680	you know, because the socialist argument was under capitalism, you're free to starve,
1583680	1587840	right? But under socialism, the individual will be allowed to flourish. So she sits down with him,
1587840	1592480	and she goes, people are getting locked up for their political views. There's no free speech.
1592480	1598480	Like this is not what we're about. And Lenin goes, this is like a, like a bourgeois privilege.
1598480	1603440	Like we're, we're in a time of revolution. Once this kind of civil, Russian civil war settled,
1603440	1607760	then we're going to be reintroducing freedoms. And it was a complete lie. Once the Russian civil
1607760	1613920	war, as she saw personally, was stopped, then they just doubled down even more. And even Lenin's
1613920	1619920	erstwhile colleagues from other, like the anarchists, the, the Mensheviks, they were all locked up.
1619920	1624560	And when Lenin adopted their views, the Menshevik views, and the Menshevik started pointing out
1624560	1628320	goes, if you point this out, that is being counterrevolutionary, you're going to go to jail.
1628320	1635280	So even pointing out the hypocrisy became a felony. So, you know, yeah, very quickly,
1635280	1642240	it became clear what this means in practice. And God bless her and her partner in crime,
1642240	1648400	literal crime, Alexander Berkman, they fled the Soviet Union very early on, they went to the West,
1648400	1653120	they said, guys, this is a complete nightmare. These are people are not helping the workers.
1653120	1660240	They're like, we're for violence. We're not like pansies here. I try to kill Frick. We're for bloody
1660240	1664720	revolution. We're for stealing food if you're starving. You're not, but, but this is not what
1664720	1670080	we're about. They're oppressing the, the say exact people we're supposedly for. And the Western
1670080	1674640	intellectuals who love having other people do the dirty work, we're like, oh, you don't get it.
1674640	1681920	Or like, it's fine. So that kind of, to me, was very disturbing. And this is something that happens
1681920	1688960	to this day when you have these eyewitnesses, you know, speak their truth and testify as to what
1688960	1693040	they saw. And you have someone who went to Harvard be like, oh, you don't get it. Read a book.
1695360	1699120	Talking about anarchists, especially in the US, what was the story of Lewis Ling?
1699680	1705840	Oh, God, Lewis Ling story. I love him. He's such a badass. Lewis Ling was one of seven men. There
1705840	1715120	was a, in, I forget the year, in the late 1800s, there was a rally in Haymarket Square in Chicago.
1716080	1719440	This is when they were, after the Civil War had ended, they thought there was going to be a third
1719440	1724320	American revolution. You had the first one, which overthrew aristocracy and monarchy. The second,
1724320	1727120	which overthrew slavery. And now you're going to have one, which is going to overthrow the
1727120	1731120	capitalists. And we're going to have, you know, a revolution here in America and have things like
1731200	1736160	the eight hour day and, you know, abolish profit and all that other stuff that they liked. And there
1736160	1743280	was a meeting, public meeting. There were some speeches. It was peaceful, not mostly peaceful.
1743280	1747920	It was entirely peaceful. The mayor came. He's like, all right, no problem here. He leaves.
1747920	1752720	Someone throws a bomb. We still don't know to this day who threw that bomb for what purpose.
1752720	1755600	A lot of cops were killed. A lot of cops started shooting. A lot of people were killed.
1756160	1761280	They arrested seven people and they put them on various anarchists, some who weren't even there.
1762240	1767440	Some who had spoken there and advocated peace and they put them on trial is basically,
1767440	1772000	like you preach this ideology and they charged them with murder, even though there was not even
1772000	1776960	an allegation that they had thrown the bomb or encouraged it or were like, yeah, more, you know,
1776960	1783440	Lewis Ling, they searched his house and they found bombs at his house. And his attorney said, well,
1784320	1788880	my client has the right to have bombs in his house. And which became this kind of meme
1788880	1792880	before memes were a thing where it's like, he's described to have said,
1792880	1797200	I couldn't have thrown that bomb. I was at home making bombs. And they imprisoned him and
1797840	1803760	someone's, we still don't know how, snuck a blasting capsule into his jail. And rather than
1803760	1809920	me hanged, he detonated his jaw. And he was, if you look at photos of Lewis Ling, it's like a
1809920	1814400	time traveler because he looks like Channing Tatum or something. He looks like he came out of
1814400	1817680	Abercrombie at, I think Abercrombie is not doing the like the studs anymore, but whatever, like
1817680	1823280	when Abercrombie was the thing. And he blows off his jaw, it's hanging. And with his blood,
1823280	1827440	he writes on the wall, hooray for anarchy. And he dies the next day. He's like, they're not going
1827440	1836960	to get to me. So he was, you know, people ignorantly romanticized Che Guevara. But he was the first
1836960	1842800	really, it's like young spirit of violent defiance. And I mean, violent in every sense of the word.
1843680	1851600	And he really was a, you know, people, the cop who arrested him wrote a book about it. And even
1851600	1855840	he talked about how people came to visit him in jail because they were so impressed by his like
1855840	1861920	magnificent physique and what a study was. So he really was a total badass. You know, he
1862000	1867280	certainly not a good guy, but certainly in terms of literature, this kind of very
1868480	1873600	specific archetypical figure. What happened to the other six? Oh, they were hanged. One, no, no, no.
1873600	1879680	What did one apologize? Sorry. They were told if you write for clemency, the governor will
1880640	1884640	lessen the charges. And some of them are like, I'm not, I didn't do anything. I didn't kill,
1884640	1889760	I didn't kill anyone. I'm not for murder. I'm not asking for clemency. And they're like, all right.
1889760	1895680	And in fact, one of them, as he went to the gallows, turns and says, can I address the crowd and
1895680	1899520	say a few words? And they just killed him right then and there. So they became, and there's,
1899520	1906480	they got pardoned at posthumously. There's a monument to their, to them in a cemetery near
1906480	1911280	Chicago. Emma Goldman was repatriated to be buried there as well. The dates on her tombstone are
1911280	1918080	wrong, which is funny. And the quote for August B's quote is worded several different ways,
1918080	1924800	but one of them, they're all effectively technically the same meaning. Someday the voices,
1924800	1929040	someday our voices, someday our voices will speak louder than those you strangle today.
1929840	1933120	And it's true. How would you describe the
1935120	1939440	vibe of political philosophy at the start of the 20th century? Because everything kind of
1939440	1944640	comes out of this, right? We're talking about anarchism around that sort of a time. We're about
1944720	1948720	to have the First World War. We're about to have the inception of the Soviet Union.
1948720	1951920	We're about to have this sort of onset of communism and then downstream from that,
1951920	1958560	everything else happening. What was unique about that period in terms of political philosophy history
1958560	1964240	that enabled this mix of ingredients to start cooking?
1964240	1969200	I think a big part of it was the rise of the intellectual, because you had the industrial
1969200	1973200	revolution happening kind of in that window. And as a result of this, there was a lot more
1973200	1977520	money going around and there was a lot more opportunity for people to make their living
1977520	1984480	just being intellectuals. And intellectuals had a much higher status in that society.
1984480	1990240	They became an emergent class. And also you had these enormous fortunes being generated as a
1990240	1996240	result of industrialization becoming a thing. Farmers were kind of on the down and instead
1996240	2001280	you had people building factories and these giant kind of conglomerates that were changing the face
2001280	2006560	of the world. And you had reactions to this, progressivism, of course, being one of them in
2006560	2012080	America. This kind of classical liberalism was falling by the wayside because the argument was
2012720	2018960	not unreasonably, I think, you had these enormous amounts of immigrants coming to the States
2019600	2024560	from Europe and Eastern Europe and from Ireland and Italy. And they're living in these horrifying
2024560	2030320	conditions. They don't have sanitation. People are getting injured at work and there's no hope for
2030320	2036080	them. Children are dying young because there's no birth control and you have a woman who's got
2036080	2039520	no husband and 13 kids, like what's she going to do? She has to prostitute herself.
2041040	2046160	So when you have these horrifying conditions, at the same time you have the rise of the kind of
2046160	2050160	monopolist class, a lot of people were like, all right, something's not adding up here.
2050880	2057040	So we got to figure out how to square this circle. And there were different approaches
2057040	2060880	to what that would look like. On the one hand, you had, so what people don't appreciate now is
2060880	2067120	socialism at the time was really this kind of blanket term about that society has to be managed
2067120	2071200	somehow for the greater good. It didn't mean the government runs everything necessarily. That is kind
2071200	2076480	of the strain that went out. But anarchists consider themselves socialists even though they
2076480	2081600	were opposed to government entirely. So they were kind of, you had in Britain, you had the Fabian
2081600	2089280	Society coming out, you had the webs. And the Bolsheviks were the ones who won. And I think what
2089280	2093360	ended up happening, and I don't think this is particularly ambiguous, is all these different
2093360	2098800	branches of intellectual leftism were like, all right, we've got a shot here. This is the one
2098800	2105200	country where they're trying it. We have to make it work and give it a shot to see if it does work.
2105200	2110800	And Eugene Lyons, who was a former communist, a guest on the book, journalist said, yeah, you
2110800	2116560	guys were looking at the Russians like guinea pigs. And you were perfectly happy to have them
2116560	2123040	just be ground into nothing, because this was your noble experiment. And they were the ones paying
2123040	2126880	the price, but you were the ones kind of reaping the benefits. Yeah, that's so interesting. The
2126880	2134160	fact that even if it wasn't particularly your brand of socialism, your brand of progressivism that
2134160	2141360	you wanted, even if they weren't getting it right, and the costs that were being, the toll was huge,
2142320	2145600	if at the end of it, you could have pointed at it and said, well, that was a victory that went
2145600	2152160	well, that would justify your movement going forward. And in all fairness, as different times
2153840	2159120	moved on, there were plenty of socialists and leftists who were like, all right, I'm out.
2159200	2167520	Too much. Yeah, when Hitler and Stalin signed the Rippentrop Pact, and a treaty of non-aggression,
2167520	2172720	and they basically started becoming buddies, overnight, many of these communist front
2172720	2177280	organizations in the West changed their names from advocating for being against fascism to
2177280	2181200	being for peace. Oh, no, no, we got to stay out of the world or two. But there were lots
2181840	2186880	of progressives, hardcore progressives who were like, they're like, you're shaking hands with
2186880	2192000	Hitler. Okay, that's a wrap. Like, this is not ambiguous. This is completely where we're against.
2192000	2196800	I'm out of here. So they still remained, you know, hardcore democratic socialists or whatever
2196800	2201840	progressives depending on the individual. But in terms of having a love affair for the Soviet Union,
2201840	2207440	that was a big one for them to swallow. And also just other things like the Hungarian Revolution
2207440	2213280	and Prague Spring, Afghanistan, these were big, big problems for lots of leftists, but not so much
2213280	2219280	for people like the New York Times. The Espionage Act was, is that the same thing that's still in
2219280	2227440	now? Is that the same basis in America for deporting people that have been accused of being foreign
2227440	2231680	agents and stuff like that? The one that was, I think it was 1916, 1917. Is that the same?
2233280	2238400	No, I don't, I'm not sure that it is. So what you're referring to is after Leon Chalgas killed,
2238800	2244560	President McKinley in 1901, and Teddy Roosevelt came in and Tessa Roosevelt said, you know,
2244560	2249280	anarchisms are the worst people ever. It's worse than slavery and so on and so forth.
2249280	2253840	And they basically passed a law saying if you're an anarchist or have certain other ideologies,
2253840	2258160	you can be deported. And there was something called the Red Ark where they rounded up a bunch of
2258720	2262240	anarchists and radicals, including Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman, and sent them,
2262240	2268000	get your ass back to Russia, which if you love it so much. I don't know how, if that is still,
2268000	2270960	I'm sure it's probably still legally enforced because laws don't ever get repealed,
2270960	2276160	but I don't know if that's the basis for, if it's being used in a contemporary terms.
2276160	2281440	Yeah, you said in 1916, keeping us out of the war was a winning slogan. By 1917, it was a crime?
2281440	2286320	Yeah. So Woodrow Wilson very famously campaigned on, he kept us out of war, right? And Woodrow
2286320	2294320	Wilson was only the second Democrat to be elected president after the Civil War. McKinley was,
2294320	2297600	not McKinley, excuse me, Grover Cleveland was elected to two not consecutive terms
2297600	2303520	because the Republican party just basically ran the table. And since Taft and Teddy Roosevelt in
2303520	2309200	1912 split the Republican vote, Wilson snuck in, but it was not at all clear that he was going to
2309200	2313200	get reelected because the Republicans regrouped. They had Charles Evans Hughes, who was a former
2313200	2320400	governor of New York and Supreme Court justice as the nominee. And it's like, all right, we got
2320480	2324400	this in the bag, you know what I mean? And it was, I think it was like 3000, 2000 votes in
2324400	2329920	California decided that election and it went for Wilson and he got reelected. But this was
2329920	2334320	the big argument, he kept us out of war. And then a few months later, it's like, well, we got to go
2334320	2338640	to fight war in Europe, which was complete violation of the Monroe Doctrine and what America
2338640	2346480	stood for since its inception. And very heavily, Wilson introduced, just like Lenin was saying to
2346560	2351360	Goldman, you know, free speech is kind of this bourgeois contrivance. You can't have it under
2351360	2356000	times of war. He's saying the same thing. So people who were advocating against the draft,
2356640	2360960	people who were advocating things like that were imprisoned, including Eugene V. Debs,
2360960	2365360	who was the socialist candidate for president. He locked him up and it came upon Warren Harding,
2365360	2370400	who was inaugurated in 1921, to, you know, I don't know if you pardon him or game clemency
2370400	2374960	to get him out of jail. So they were imprisoning a lot. They were, you know, reading the mail.
2374960	2381280	It was very much a totalitarian vision. And the excuse was, you know, we have to do this,
2381280	2384720	because otherwise it's going to be German spies. We have to fight the Kaiser, so on and so forth,
2384720	2389840	make the world safe for democracy. But these were just complete brazen violation of all sorts of
2389840	2393280	constitutional principles that are regarded nowadays as a sacrosanct.
2393280	2396480	Mason What are the principles that the Soviet Union was founded on then,
2396480	2402640	it's like 1917 at any time. What was the fundamental philosophy or principles that it was
2403120	2407040	Well, there's the de facto de jure, right? So there's what they said it was, and then there's
2407040	2412320	what it was in reality. So Lenin campaigned on this concept of all power to the Soviets.
2412320	2416320	So the idea is you have these localized worker councils and the workers, you know,
2416320	2420400	now that they're liberated from the shackles of capitalist control, they're going to sit down,
2420400	2423200	figure out how to run the factory better for themselves. Everyone's going to share in the
2423200	2427680	wealth. Everyone's going to put in their two cents from each according to his ability. So
2427680	2431120	you're stronger than I am. So you're going to do the heavy lifting, maybe I'm better with
2431120	2434720	my little hands with screws. You know, everyone's going to work together. It's going to work out
2434720	2440640	just phenomenally great. So you have this kind of sense of localized control. But very quickly,
2440640	2447840	it became, you know, Lenin what Lenin wanted and Trotsky his kind of sidekick. And you had
2447840	2453440	plays like in New York Times saying explicitly, Lenin is not a dictator. He's just getting his
2453440	2458880	way because he's smarter than everybody. You know, so like the most pro Lenin propaganda that
2458880	2462800	even Lenin kind of would maybe shy away from saying with a straight face in the Soviet Union,
2462800	2467280	because he didn't have some semblance of humility in the West. It was just like this guy's
2467280	2474160	come to kind of save the world from the bad guys and we own whatever we can to make sure it works.
2474160	2477040	You said that Lenin was widely regarded as a lunatic.
2477040	2477760	Yes.
2477760	2478080	Why?
2478800	2485280	Well, before this idea that, okay, we're going to come in, we're going to overthrow capitalism,
2485280	2490800	we're going to because, you know, the Marxist idea is much more radical than what the Soviet
2490800	2495600	Union even tried to implement because the Soviet Union wasn't theory. It's like putting your ideas
2495600	2500720	to practice, right? So this kind of concept of, you know, everything is going to be done through
2500720	2505280	the state and we're going to change the very nature of man, that human being is infinitely
2505280	2510400	plasticine. You know, early on they were talking about like, okay, what if kids are raised communally?
2510560	2516080	That was wild. That absolutely took. What was the thing about code on marriage,
2516080	2520320	the family and guardianship, it was seen as bourgeois to prefer your own children over others?
2520320	2526720	Right. So what they did correctly or logically is you take the idea of equality
2527360	2532000	and then you just extrapolate it everywhere you go and it's just like, it leads to consequences.
2532000	2536240	So here's an idea. So like, let me give you a counter, a counter example that I was in my
2536240	2541440	North Korea book, Dear Reader, when conservatives say the family is the basic unit of society,
2541440	2546640	right? So they do that in North Korea, meaning if you commit a crime, Christopher,
2546640	2551440	like the Williamson family is on trial because it's the next eight generations, but it's a unit,
2551440	2555840	unit means one, it's not divisible. So if the family is the unit and someone commits a crime,
2555840	2559600	the family goes on trial. So they are putting that into practice. Now that's not what conservatives
2559600	2563920	mean, of course, but when you're talking about equality and you mean it thoroughly, it's just
2564400	2571040	why should one child be advantaged by having loving, wealthy parents? And we have an aspect
2571040	2576240	of that here, which I don't know that they're all entirely crazy. The argument is, why should I,
2576240	2581200	who's the heir to the Kardashian fortune as a kid, have all these advantages? I'm never going to
2581200	2586560	have to work a day in my life. You're born to a mother addicted to heroin in some gutter.
2587440	2591040	We're not going to start off with the same opportunities. That's not fair. And I think
2591120	2595360	there's something to that. But if they take it the extreme of, well, why should one kid have more
2595360	2600000	love or a better parent than another? We're just going to take the kids and raise them all together
2600000	2603520	by professionals. The government teachers are going to raise them. They're going to be trained in
2603520	2608560	this. Not like, look, every mom and dad's winging it. That's not fair to those kids. We need to have
2608560	2614160	professionals and experts raising them. And don't worry, the mom after work can go visit her kid
2614160	2620320	if she chooses. This was the, the, the model for their whole country. And some of it, they had
2620320	2628080	enormous pushback and some of it they implemented. But the whole point is this is a new scientific
2628080	2633200	society. You guys are old, funny dotties. You're doing things just because your grandma did a
2633200	2639280	certain way. We're starting from scratch and we rebuilding it nice and clean along scientific
2639280	2644240	principles. None of this emotionalism, this kind of bourgeois sentiment like, Oh, I love my kid.
2644240	2650400	No, no, no, no, no, no. This kid doesn't belong to you. This kid belongs to everyone. So it's, it
2650400	2656720	doesn't, it's really, once you put it into practice, you know, in North Korea, as another example,
2656720	2661040	like in construction, like the women have to do the construction also because women and women are
2661040	2665040	equal. So they're putting into practice and it's just like, okay, good luck with that.
2665040	2667600	Is this a warning for what happens if you take
2667680	2669520	scientism or rationality too far?
2670880	2676720	Um, I don't think so because I don't think it's really rational because I think that
2677280	2680800	does it think that it's rational? It does. But I think everything thinks it's rational,
2680800	2688720	right? Other Nietzsche, right? So this, I, the issue is thinking you're more informed than you are
2688720	2693200	and not having this kind of understanding the limits or the bounds of your own understanding
2693200	2700960	of competence. So this kind of love of a mother for her child isn't just like a custom or tradition.
2700960	2708480	It's my understanding that when a child is born, both the parents have this biochemical reaction
2708480	2713520	to seeing this kids. We even see with the seagulls, right? If seagulls are raised without their mom,
2713520	2718160	they can imprint on like a sock with a seagull face and that feeds the kid. But there is this
2718240	2724560	kind of literal brain connection between the two. They did cat scans on dogs, right? And dogs,
2725120	2729520	the parts of the brain light up when they see you, their owners as other members of a pack.
2730160	2736080	So there is that thing kind of that's happening in their head. So as we spoke earlier about
2736080	2743840	cynicism, when you have this scientific view that emotions don't exist or don't matter or that they're
2744800	2750880	irrational, emotions are more rational than people give them credit for. And at the very
2750880	2760400	basis, and apologies to Ben Shapiro, feelings in many ways do inform facts. There is some reason,
2761200	2767440	I don't know, I can't articulate what it is, why I like this song over that song.
2767440	2772880	Even if the other song is melodically, compositionally, yeah, feelings don't care about your facts
2772880	2779520	in that regard. Right, right. But it's not, I'm not liking this song because some capitalists
2779520	2785280	told me to or because of my, or maybe I am, but I don't think that's entirely, it can be
2785280	2788560	described entirely that. Because then we'd all like the same songs, that's not the case.
2788560	2794720	It would be the mathematically best melodically, harmonially best song, yeah. I mean, I see this,
2794720	2798640	I've been playing around a lot with this in my own sort of personal life, trying to,
2799600	2804800	after this period of, you know, 600 episodes in whatever five years or something that I've done
2804800	2809760	on the podcast, and then praying at the altar of cerebral horsepower and cognition and all these
2809760	2815600	smart people that I've got to spend time with, then trying to reintegrate, I don't know, like some
2815600	2823440	embodied emotional sense of just knowing and wisdom without sounding too Austin psychedelic-y,
2823440	2831520	right? Not some woo out there, run to burn the secret shit, just your programming and your
2831520	2837360	nature and your intuition is able to aggregate more information than your prefrontal cortex is
2837360	2842160	able to rationalize. Yes. The reason that you crossed the street because that person was on
2842160	2847120	that side. Why? Break it down for me. Tell me what it was about that person specifically
2847120	2851680	that you had an issue with. Why? I don't know. I just, it was something I got a feeling. Well,
2851680	2856000	yeah, because you're able to out the way that they walked, the way that they looked, the body,
2856000	2861360	like all of that stuff, right? And like I say, from a personal standpoint, now trying to
2862480	2866320	reintegrate those two things. So when you scale it up to the size of an entire
2868000	2873440	nation, I can see why there would be, you know, there's conflict within me with this. I can see
2873440	2878320	why there would be conflict when it comes to trying to build a national philosophy off this.
2878320	2885520	And also this idea that everything is quantifiable. Like if you asked me to rank all the songs I like,
2886240	2889680	I don't know that. And that's a, you know, very obvious, very easy example. I don't know that
2889680	2893600	any people do it. And I think it would be extremely dynamic. You know, there's some days when you
2893600	2897280	want to listen to that ballad and there's some days when you want to listen to some synths.
2897280	2903120	So this idea that you could kind of sit down and just figure it out for even one person is
2903840	2906640	kind of, even if it's yourself is kind of absurd. So
2907200	2912800	where did this passion for revolution in the Soviet Union come from? Because it's so
2912800	2916960	Marx, it came from Marx. It's so fervent. Yeah. So Marx was a,
2918640	2925200	he took the Christian eschatology, this kind of the book of Revelation of St. John, this idea that
2925200	2930720	we're going to have this, you know, big revolution, and it's going to bring about, you know, the
2930720	2935680	heavenly kingdom here on earth. He didn't use those terms, but he very much fed, and this
2935680	2943600	isn't really disputed, he very much fed into this kind of vision of bringing a new world peace
2944560	2949280	through the state. And, you know, Marx very famously in Engels talked about, you know,
2949280	2952720	after it all works out, the state's going to wither away because human man, he'll be all equal,
2952720	2956880	and we won't need the government anymore, and everything's just going to kind of work itself
2956880	2965280	out. But they really thought that, and they're not entirely wrong, that we are going to create,
2965280	2970880	now that the industrial revolution has happened, and we have technology, and we have electricity,
2970880	2978480	we have the capacity to remake reality into something that the world had never seen before,
2978480	2984240	and something that's going to make things great for everybody. So they were right in the sense that
2984880	2989920	they now had the capacity to remake society into something the world never seen before.
2989920	2995280	But there's other examples of this, which is plastic surgery was invented as a result of
2995280	3000480	World War I, because for the first time, you had these soldiers coming back from, you know,
3000480	3005680	the front, and they were all deformed and mangled in ways that, you know, hadn't been seen before.
3005680	3010320	And if you look at googling, you know, first photos, the first people who had plastic surgery,
3010560	3013760	it's completely nightmarish, you know, but you have to take those halting steps
3013760	3018400	to get to the point where it's, you know, contemporary Beverly Hills. But this, you know,
3018400	3024880	this era, this was, you keep in mind in World War I, you had the king, and then you had a Kaiser,
3024880	3028960	and then you had the head of the Ottoman Empire, and you had, you know, Archduke Franz Ferdinand,
3028960	3035360	and you had the Tsar, and then you had, I think Italy had a king. So even though it's like 1914
3035360	3044160	to 1917 and 19, through 1920, in some senses, for us, this is just like another world. I mean,
3044160	3047440	obviously, Queen Elizabeth just recently passed away, but she was a symbol, you know,
3047440	3051840	she's not running things. But this was a time where these people really were running things.
3051840	3057760	And this really was a break from that kind of tradition of aristocracy or landed gentry into,
3057760	3061440	like, all right, this is going to be the ultimate sense of democratization.
3062240	3067840	What was happening in the Soviet Union before it became the Soviet Union? Why was it primed
3068400	3073680	in such a way? Well, I don't think that, well, that's the thing it wasn't. So if you read Marxist,
3074560	3081120	you know, orthodoxy, what would prime a country for this kind of worker's revolution would be
3081120	3087840	industrialization, right, and severe monopolization and concentration of wealth. So Marx would expect
3087920	3092800	it to happen in like the US or Britain or Germany. Yeah, that was not Hargreaves. What was the name
3092800	3096080	of that factory where everybody kicked off and then they just brought new workers in?
3096880	3101360	In the steel mills in, I'm blanking on the term right now, near Pittsburgh.
3102800	3106880	But no, but they would be nationwide. Like, you would nationwide have the workers be completely
3106880	3109920	oppressed and the workers are going to rise up and it's going to be a worldwide thing. But you
3109920	3114960	don't go from like this feudal, the czarist, it was basically feudalism, you know, in many ways up
3114960	3120720	until the czar fell. And you know, people were like working the soil, it was very primitive
3120720	3126400	conditions. The czar falls, you have the first revolution, they have their parliament, but
3127120	3131200	people had been under this thumb of czars for hundreds of years, they're not used to
3131200	3138320	representative democracy. The parliament had very little power to do really anything. And then when
3138320	3144960	Lenin came in and basically seized power in 1917, late 1917, it was like, no one really
3144960	3148560	know what that meant. It's like, okay, the Bolsheviks are running things now. And they very
3148560	3152400	quickly realized what it meant that he wasn't messing around. This is a different breed.
3153440	3157120	Yeah, this isn't like the difference between like the Democratic Party and the Green Party.
3159920	3167360	One thing that I didn't know was that the original inception of this was in the hopes of
3168160	3174560	becoming the first, the tip of the spear of a worldwide movement, that the Soviet Union would
3174560	3180080	be the test case. They almost saw themselves as the opportunity to prove that this could happen,
3180080	3183280	and then from there, they would... They did see themselves that, yes. Very explicitly.
3183280	3186720	But what you've got, what you mentioned earlier on that we'll get onto with regards to the press
3186720	3194560	and the way that this was interpreted and responded to in the US specifically, you had some people
3194560	3200000	in the US that were seeing it as that experiment too. So you had a kind of collusion, like a
3200000	3204240	philosophical collusion that was going on across the Atlantic.
3204240	3209520	Well, it wasn't just a collusion. So this was the big argument between... A lot of times in politics
3209520	3215040	to this day, you'll have there an in religion. You have the putative argument where it's like,
3215040	3220240	all right, you had the argument between the Gnostics and Orthodox Christianity. Is Christ
3220240	3225120	co-equal with God the Father or is Christ subordinate to him? That's the Aryan heresy, I
3225120	3230480	believe. But a lot of times just about power. You just have an excuse to fight one another.
3230480	3237520	So Trotsky, who was again Lenin's right-hand man, he had the vision, which is more in line with
3237520	3244160	Orthodox Marxism, that instead of thinking of nations, you think of classes. So the workers,
3244160	3247440	workers of the world unite. You have nothing to lose, but you're changed. That's the great Marxist
3247440	3256320	quote. So his idea is the working class in Russia have more in common with the working class in
3256320	3261760	America than they do with the bourgeoisie in Russia. And that makes a lot of sense. And this
3261760	3266400	is one of the reasons they were very much against the Great War. They're like, why are the workers
3266400	3273680	and the poor losing their lives for the sake of czars and sultans and kaisers? We're the ones who
3273680	3278560	pay the price for the wealthy. This is absolutely obscene. This is our opportunity to, you know,
3278560	3282080	what they would call imperialist wars or capitalist wars, put a stop to it and have the
3282080	3286960	workers of the world basically unify and create this, maybe not literally a paradise, but certainly
3286960	3291280	the next generation of humanity. You know, when Stalin came in and he saw that wasn't happening,
3291280	3297520	he was like, all right, you could have socialism in one country. But that was kind of the idea that,
3297520	3305120	all right, it's going to start here. And this was a very real concern because Marxism predicted
3305680	3311440	that capitalism would be destroyed by its own contradictions, right? And then 1929 happens.
3311440	3316800	You know, this is 12 years after Lenin ceases power in what became the Soviet Union. You have the
3316800	3321360	Great Depression. Things are unprecedentedly bad for unprecedented long time. There have been
3321360	3326480	depressions before, but they never went out for that longer, that badly. People are looking around,
3326480	3330240	and all the Marxists are saying with a straight face, we predicted this,
3330960	3335120	and now you're seeing our predictions. And people, a lot of people were like, all right,
3335120	3340720	there's this, these are the death throes of capitalism. And in that sense, FDR, you know,
3340720	3347840	who is, you know, reviled by many conservatives can be seen as the right wing response because
3347840	3353280	the alternative to FDR wasn't Calvin Coolidge. The alternative to FDR was very easily could have
3353280	3358400	been a worker's revolution and having a communist dictatorship here in the States.
3358400	3362720	What was that quote about? The capitalist will sell us the rope and we'll tie the news.
3362720	3366400	Yeah, Lenin is alleged to have said, and apparently he never did,
3366400	3369840	that the capitalist will sell us the rope with which we'll hang them.
3369840	3375520	Yes, that was it. Yeah, that's funny. And then, do you think that he was actually true when he
3375520	3382480	said that once we've reached the utopia that was supposed to this communist utopia, that we will
3382480	3390400	be able to discard these methods? No, because the reason communism doesn't work isn't simply due to
3390400	3395360	the human nature being bad, which doesn't even make sense, because if you are basing your philosophy
3395360	3399760	on human nature, it is the basis for your philosophy. You can't say it's good or bad. It's like saying,
3399760	3404240	well, I'm going to build an airplane and it's going to let people fly from their own power,
3404240	3408480	but the people are bad. Well, if you're building around people can't fly, the problem is in your
3408480	3414720	program, not in the person or you're building around. The problem is calculation. So without a
3415520	3422160	market to set price, you do not know how much to produce. So a very obvious example is you don't
3422160	3427040	know and have to know anything about comic books at all. But if you go to a comic book store and
3427040	3434320	you see Detective Comics number 26 is $500 and Detective Comics 27 is $50,000 and Detective
3434320	3440960	Comics 28 is $6,000, something about number 27 is special. You don't have to know it's the first
3440960	3445520	experience of Batman, but you do know how to know is that either supply of this issue is very low
3445520	3451680	or the demand is very high, but even not knowing the facts as to why that price is information
3451680	3458400	about this is something that the market is asking for more of. But if I am setting a price, if I am
3458400	3465760	as the government saying Detective Comics number 27 is going to be sold at $1,000, very quickly it's
3465760	3468960	going to be a complete sold out everywhere. You're not going to be able to find it because it's way
3468960	3472640	below the market. If you're going to be able to sell it's maybe going to be at the black market
3472640	3479120	and that's going to be a blank store shelves. On the other hand, if I say we're going to produce
3479120	3483600	X amount of copies of Detective Comics 27, then you're going to have these massive surpluses
3483600	3487200	because at a certain point, if you don't have the price, you don't know how much to produce.
3487920	3492400	Without having a price mechanism, you can't have central planning work because it's not
3492400	3497280	going to have information about how much you need because at the same time, even if I tell you the
3497280	3505360	commissar, listen, my factory needs a hundred more nails, those nails are still competing with screws
3505360	3512400	and bolts, but also bread and milk and cars and CDs and computers. Every product is in
3512400	3517040	competition with every other product and a currency is what kind of adjudicates those disputes
3517040	3522240	between the demands. But if you're just telling me I need 50 nails and he's telling me I need 50
3522240	3528240	pacemakers, both are in need, how do I figure out which is needed more and that's what price
3528240	3533760	indicates. Is that the fundamental structural issue when it comes to communism? Well, when it
3533760	3538800	comes to central planning, yes, in my opinion. What else? What are the other elements? Well,
3538800	3544640	I think the other elements, it's very, very expensive to try to, in every sense of the word,
3544640	3550640	to try to force a population to live according to your ideology. At a certain point, you need a
3550640	3555920	lot of them to buy in or to have it enforce themselves because you can only pay so many police
3555920	3559760	to beat so many people. And at a certain point, people are like, I don't want to be beating
3559760	3565760	people anymore. Is there an argument to be made that in that case, a capitalist system that applies
3566320	3573600	status and gives prestige to people who are the most productive, they are allowed to accrue that
3573600	3578960	through the agreement of other people saying that, yes, your job title and high rise office is
3578960	3583360	something that quite rightly you should feel proud about. Is there an argument to be made that
3583360	3588320	capitalism is just a more nefarious way of motivating workers to do the exact same thing?
3588320	3595440	Well, I don't think that CEOs are held in the same regard in any capitalist country
3596000	3603920	as Stalin was. You know, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk is like, there was, I think maybe he's number
3603920	3610000	two now richest person on earth. The way people are shit on Elon Musk, 25, 8 on Twitter alone,
3610000	3615600	even before he bought Twitter, there was no shortage of people condemning Elon Musk or condemning Steve
3615600	3625120	Jobs or condemning Bill Gates, George Soros. I don't think successful CEOs other than,
3626480	3629920	what's his name, who run Apple for many years with the turtleneck before he died.
3629920	3632400	Tim Cook? Oh, what? Steve Jobs.
3632400	3636080	Yeah, Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs, maybe he's on a pedestal. I'm thinking of Jeff Bezos,
3636080	3642960	sorry, I got this confused. I think very few CEOs are regarded with any sort of reverence
3643760	3649360	in the same way that the kind of leaders in these countries are expected to be revered.
3649360	3655840	You're not hanging up a photo, even if you're a big shit poster of Elon Musk in your house.
3657200	3662800	Would it be right for me to characterize the two prongs, the two sort of most brutal prongs of
3662800	3670240	existence in the Soviet Union? One as being the food and lack of access, so famine on one side.
3670880	3677280	And then on the other side being the combination of state police and sort of state enforced
3678160	3684800	surveillance from the population on itself, that those would be, it seems like that gets an awful
3684800	3691840	lot of focus, not on a food and too much brutality coming from the state and also
3692800	3699040	like caused by its own population on itself. But I think in the West,
3699840	3704960	we can look at things as discrete issues, right? We can say it's a problem that
3704960	3710240	none of people have access to healthcare, even in places without the NHS, right? We can say that
3711200	3715200	education is an issue, they're teaching kids things that they shouldn't and they're not teaching
3715200	3720400	kids that they should. Or we can talk about pornography with young men, too many people
3720400	3724720	are consuming pornography, it's deleterious to the health. But these are looked at in a way as
3724720	3732240	kind of discrete issues. I think the issue with totalitarianism is you don't get to separate out
3732240	3737680	these things, like everything feeds into another. And it's not, and it's kind of like if you remove
3737680	3743520	the secret police, you still have, you know, you're at school all the time, you're learning
3743520	3750160	all this stuff, you're still consuming the media with all the issues. The fact that your job
3750160	3755280	is basically assigned to you at a certain point being late to work became a felony,
3755280	3760720	even though it was not at all reliable, the public transport system in these countries.
3760720	3771680	So I think we could both sit here until we're blue in the face, but until we've lived in these
3771680	3777840	places, we are not going to know what the worst part of it is. It's kind of like, it's kind of
3777920	3784320	like Plato's Cave. Just how bad did the famine get? Which one? Well, I mean, pick whichever
3784320	3788480	of your favorites there was. Well, I didn't have any favorites, most certainly. But if you're
3788480	3793440	talking about the Holodomor in the early 1930s, you know, Stalin's war in Ukraine,
3794800	3798160	Red Famine is a book by Ann Applebaum, which I recommend enormously, even though she's
3799040	3807360	got some pretty bad TDS, which doesn't at all take away from the enormous service she's done
3807360	3813920	in her research. They just decided, all right, we're going to liquidate the Kulaks.
3813920	3820800	And the Kulaks were these kind of wealthy farmers and very, and we're going to kill them or deport
3820800	3826880	them to God knows where with their families. But very quickly, a Kulak became anyone who owns
3826880	3832240	like a cow. And a Kulak became someone in your village you don't like. You just got to turn them
3832240	3836720	in, accuse them of being a Kulak, and then you're rewarded with a grain for your family. So the
3836800	3842800	incentives were very heavily to turn on your neighbors. And you weren't allowed to leave your
3842800	3851520	village. And they took as much grain as they could. And they sold it for export. And people,
3851520	3856880	I mean, the levels of starvation were in the millions. And this was by design. So they came
3856880	3861680	back in the middle of the night, you know, these activists to search houses. And if you, they could
3862160	3868240	look, this is the sick thing that I learned about the Haldimor is your own body would betray you.
3868240	3872240	They could take one look at you and see you're not starving. That means you're
3872240	3877200	less gaunt than you're less gaunt. That means you're hiding food, whereas the food. And if you
3877200	3883360	don't give me the food, that means I know you're hiding it. So that means I'm entitled to burn
3883360	3889120	down your house and put you out in the winter in the Ukrainian winter. And good luck with that.
3889120	3892480	Because if you don't, if you're not handing it to me, you must be hiding it. And therefore,
3892480	3900880	you're a Kulak. And what else ended up happening is in the rest of the USSR, they were told you
3900880	3904560	don't have food because the Kulaks are hoarding all the grain. They were created this kind of
3904560	3910880	national outgroup. And then there was this kind of level of hatred, which was later kind of
3910880	3916240	paralleled with Hitler against the Jews, to the sense of these people, you're suffering because
3916240	3920960	these people are, you know, they're getting wealthy at your expense. And there was this one
3921760	3927280	very disturbing story of this young woman who made her way to the city. She got out of her village
3927280	3934000	starving on a line begging for food. She had like a crust of bread in her hand. And the storekeeper
3934000	3938560	is like, this is what you filthy Kulaks, this is what you deserve. And God help anyone who helped
3938560	3943040	her. And then she died on the spot and everyone was basically happy about it because it's like,
3943040	3946480	we're on this line. There's no bread in the store because of her and people like her.
3947520	3953600	I don't think that it was the same famine, but there's a story about babies that were so hungry
3953600	3958640	that they cried for so long that they couldn't even cry anymore. And there's a story about a mother
3958640	3962080	whose baby was crying and then the mother just started beating the baby.
3962880	3966240	Yeah, Dave Smith brought up that. That was the story that got to him the most.
3966240	3970880	That's pretty disturbing. Yeah, like, you know, people started swarming these train stations to
3970880	3977120	try to get out of wherever they were. And there was just this one scene where this mom and she's
3977120	3983840	lost. And when the human body is starving for that long, the mind starts degenerating and,
3983840	3988160	you know, it's functional insanity. And she's there and the kids crying because there's no milk
3988160	3992880	coming out. And she snaps and she starts beating the crap out of her kid from everybody. And then
3992880	4000480	she kind of reverts to normal. And, you know, that was one of those scenes where it didn't get to
4000480	4008480	me that much because it's so removed from any... No reference point. I have no reference point for
4008480	4014880	this. Like, I can... It's hard for me for any of us to imagine what it's like being that hungry for
4014880	4019600	that long, right? Even that is like, I mean, I know people who've been on the show Survivor,
4019600	4024080	but they know that at any minute they can get to food and they're only there for third days, Max,
4024080	4029120	and, you know, they're in a tropical paradise, you know, so on and so forth. And even so that's
4029200	4033600	bad, but, you know, they like you get used to it. But that's the closest, you know, any of us are
4033600	4042160	going to get to understanding what that's like. And the thing that is really... I would think the
4042160	4048560	darkest aspect is not just the hunger. It's the knowledge that this isn't changing. Like, this,
4048560	4055360	there's no hang on, you know, we're in war. Once this war is over, you know, it's like, no, no, no,
4055440	4060320	this is peacetime. And you're not allowed to leave your village. And if God help you,
4060320	4064880	if you find food, it's going to be taken from you. I can't wrap my head around it.
4064880	4068640	And if you don't produce enough food, then we're going to ask you to produce five times the amount
4068640	4073520	of food that you didn't produce. And accuse you of stealing it. Yeah. Was this organized?
4073520	4080160	Was the famine... So the famine was created by the state? Yes, by Stalin. Why?
4080800	4086960	Because he wanted to break Ukraine. He wanted to break... He wanted to collectivize the countryside.
4086960	4092480	And for a long time, the Ukraine is very famously known as the bread basket of Europe because they
4092480	4097680	had these fertile lands and so on and so forth. And they were producing all the crops. And he's
4097680	4102800	like... And the Ukrainians, obviously, historically into this day, spoiler alert, have enormous amount
4102800	4107520	of rivalry, if not contempt for the Russian people and vice versa. And he's like, all right,
4108000	4115920	Ukraine became part of the USSR. And he's like, we have to break Ukraine and break the spirits
4115920	4122240	of the people and not have any semblance of resistance to our scheme. And in this, he succeeded,
4123120	4130880	maybe not entirely, but very heavily. Who is Walter Duranty? Walter Duranty was...
4132080	4136640	You did his voice for the promo commercial because he was British. He was the New York Times man in
4136720	4142400	Moscow. He won a Pulitzer. He got to interview Stalin, which was an enormous accomplishment for
4142400	4151200	a Westerner. And while this starvation, this war on Ukraine, and it wasn't just Ukraine,
4151200	4153840	of course, people were starving all over the Soviet Union. That's where it was localized,
4153840	4160480	I want to be clear. He was writing in the New York Times how people who are saying there's hunger,
4160480	4167840	it's just anti-Soviet propaganda. And the quote is, there is no famine, nor is there likely to be.
4167840	4172240	The Russian people are merely tightening their belts. Now, that's a very unfortunate choice of
4172240	4176240	words. I'm not trying to even be humorous. You only have to tighten your belt when you don't
4176240	4180080	have enough food. It's not a fashion choice. It means your pants are falling off because you're
4180080	4186080	losing weight. And you lose weight in two ways, diet and exercise, which they weren't doing,
4186080	4192480	or lack of caloric intake. And while this whole thing was happening, he's repeatedly
4193360	4197520	talking about how it's the people who are complaining or just the loud mouths,
4197520	4203760	everyone else is busy doing the work and putting time in the fields and producing so and so forth.
4203760	4209680	The Russians have tightened their belts before. And when Gareth Jones, who was another, who was a
4209680	4214400	British journalist, figured out what was happening because he got off his train to stop early and
4214480	4218560	just walked through the countryside and saw for himself what was happening, the entire Western
4218560	4223360	press corps, either there's differing accounts, whether this was, they sat down and said,
4223360	4227040	dude, consciously, or they just did it because they knew what their marching orders were,
4227680	4233200	called him a liar and a propagandist and so on and so forth. And Duranty was the one who took
4233200	4239840	charge of this whole campaign to smear him as a complete fraud. There was a second one,
4239840	4244000	another British man, Malcolm Ruggeridge, whose parents were members of the Fabian Society,
4244000	4249440	who was a hardcore lefty, he got information as well. And then as a result of this, when he kind
4249440	4256560	of leaked the news of this kind of manmade atrocity, he was basically couldn't get work
4256560	4260560	after that because whether it was because he had the wrong politics or whether because he
4260560	4267840	exposed his colleagues as worse than fools, as in league with the devil, he paid the price.
4267840	4273600	Well, that's the question. Walter Duranty wasn't giving an accurate account of what was happening
4273600	4279520	inside the Soviet Union. As he later admitted, yeah. Why? What was his motivation for?
4280640	4289120	I think it's very hard to get into the heads of someone who is putting his name front and center
4289120	4293920	in terms of denied genocide. I mean, I have all the quotes are in the book where he explicitly said,
4293920	4299920	there's no need for anyone to go to these villages for a reporter to tell people,
4299920	4305440	you don't need to go check it out for yourself in a country which he would clearly admit is quite
4305440	4312960	secretive, is to me, unconscionable. I mean, whatever the motivation was, it can't be good.
4313840	4319040	The best I can think of that would make the most sense to me is status. He was the dean
4319600	4327040	of the Moscow Press Corps. He was the big shot. And basically, if it's revealed that he doesn't
4327120	4331200	know what the hell he's talking about as it was, and as he admitted, it's like, well, then what
4331200	4336160	good are you? So, Opton Sinclair has this quote that's described to him. I think he actually
4336160	4340320	did say this one where he said, it's almost impossible to convince a man of something
4340320	4345120	when his salary is dependent on him not being convinced of it. So, it might be as simple as that.
4346640	4353600	Yeah. I don't know. He seemed like a very... I couldn't work out his motivations. I couldn't
4353600	4360400	work out whether it was complicity, whether he had political sympathy for what was going on over
4360400	4364960	there, whether it was simply the associated reflected glory and status that he was getting
4364960	4368960	from having this sort of access to people that no Western journalist would or should do,
4370640	4376640	perhaps a blend of all of them, I suppose. One of the other things that happened, obviously,
4376640	4380720	downstream from... Or maybe there's also a theory that he is being blackmailed to some extent.
4381200	4384400	That would make some sense that the Russians had some intel on him and they didn't want it revealed.
4384400	4390240	Who knows? That's interesting. One of the other things that happens downstream from there being
4390880	4395040	widespread famine, actually, going back to the famine for a second,
4396720	4404400	if the use of the famine from Stalin was to beat and erode the Ukrainian spirit,
4405360	4412160	surely, they could have considered, we might just kill them all. It might end up us having no
4412160	4419120	people left in the Ukraine to conquer. Well, I mean, they killed a... They sure killed a lot of them,
4419120	4426800	but I think it was... I don't... That's a good question. I wonder if that was a concern.
4428560	4431760	I guess... Because they were given some grain. It's not like they were given literally none,
4432240	4434320	they took it all, but they gave some back. Yes.
4436000	4439680	So what happens downstream from a famine? Next thing that happens is you have
4441520	4448560	an ever-increasing paranoia within the people who are in charge of what's going on
4449680	4456960	among the populace. And this... I mean, there's a story where... Is it Stalin who gives the
4457680	4465840	police and a quota for each different area? I need 10,000 criminals from this region and
4465840	4470480	this region and this region and this region, which kind of like the kids from earlier on
4470480	4475440	drive around and tell us who your accomplices are, caused the law enforcement to go around.
4475440	4480320	They were retrofitting the number of criminals to their quota for criminals,
4480320	4483680	as opposed to catching people that were doing crime.
4484320	4489600	Yeah. This is something that I think, again, Westerners have a hard time wrapping their
4489600	4494720	heads around and even I have a hard time wrapping my head around. Stalin would sit down
4495520	4500480	and he'd have a piece of paper and he'd be like, all right, in Kazakhstan, you need to arrest
4500480	4506400	50,000 people or whatever the number is in St. Petersburg or Leningrad. You need to
4506400	4511600	arrest 10,000 in Lviv. You need to arrest this many. And it was the job of the
4513120	4517280	NKVD or the KGB, whatever it was at the time, to be like, all right, this is how many people
4517280	4524320	we have to find. And his last of the secret police heads, Beria, is most known for his quote,
4525040	4530240	show me the man, I'll show you the crime. And they prided themselves on getting confessions out
4530240	4536240	of people who were perfectly innocent. And the argument is, well, if we arrested you,
4536240	4541440	you must have done something. And if you're saying that we're arresting innocent people,
4542080	4546240	that in and of itself is being counter-revolutionary and criticizing the government. So that in
4546240	4554480	itself is a crime. So yeah. And my understanding is these lists are still in like the archives
4554480	4558080	in the Kremlin, like they still have them. This isn't just like hearsay, like they have the piece
4558080	4561360	of paper where he's got the names of the different places and the numbers.
4561360	4564880	What were some of the tools that they used to extract confessions from people?
4566480	4576160	That was a very hard section to write about. Because I think people here, we think about
4576160	4580240	like what the police will do to get a confession out of you. It's like, okay, they're going to
4580240	4584480	yell at you, they're going to rough you up, you know, things like that. It's like, all right,
4585360	4591040	that's what we're used to as like police brutality. So at a certain point, they lower the death
4591040	4602880	penalty for children. So I think it was 12 or 14. 12. And this became, this was a big problem for
4602880	4607680	defendants of the Soviet Union, because this wasn't like hearsay, this was public. And they're like,
4608640	4615280	what are you doing? And one of the reasons what they were doing is if they would arrest people,
4616080	4621280	they would have a death warrant for that person's kid signed on the desk of the interrogator.
4622000	4628880	So, you know, your dad, who I got to meet a few weeks ago in Austin, he's come in, he knows he
4628880	4633440	didn't do anything. Look, I'll just talk to them, it'll be fine. And there's the death warrant for
4633440	4640080	Chris, in his view, signed. Like it's ready to be delivered. He'll confess to anything. I mean,
4640080	4645040	they were having Jews confessing and working for Hitler. And there was another time when, you
4645040	4648880	know, they brought in someone who was an old Bolshevik and the old Bolsheviks were the people
4648880	4652560	who fought the Tsar. They were like the terrorists of their time, like people who were fought with
4652560	4656320	Lenin. And they were hardened men, you know, the Bolshevik would arrest them. They had the
4656320	4662160	Gatorga system, which presaged the gulags and they'd send them to Siberia, you know,
4662160	4667600	middle of nowhere. And these men did that time for their political views. And they brought in one of
4667600	4674560	them. And they called his, I think it was his mom or his mother-in-law and check it because she's
4674560	4678960	watching his kids right there. And it's like, oh, are your kids okay? And they're like, yeah.
4678960	4682800	And so they just turned them. He's like, okay, I'll sign whatever you want, you know. So when you,
4683040	4687680	again, there's something that is hard for us to understand the West. You know, we are all used
4687680	4692640	to these movies where like, you know, someone's brought in, Tom Cruise is tied to a chair and
4692640	4697280	they're beating the crap out of him. He's like, spitting blood at them. He's just glaring at them.
4697920	4704080	You bring in, it's like, we have your kids. The calculus is, and you know, they're not bluffing.
4704080	4708320	It's not like we have them, but like, you know, we don't really want to do anything. Like, they
4708880	4716320	don't care. And you know, they don't care. And when that happens, I don't think any of us can
4716320	4719040	understand what our thought processes would be like.
4719040	4720320	What was the conveyor?
4721440	4724880	Oh, so the conveyor, yeah, there were so many different techniques that they used.
4724880	4728880	The conveyor, it was called a conveyor because, you know, they'd wake you up in the middle of the
4728880	4734800	night and someone would be yelling at you for four hours to confess. And they'd make you write
4734800	4739760	down your whole life story and they rip it up and write it again. And then every element's go,
4739760	4743840	oh, so when this happens, and then when the guy who's interviewing gets tired, they just bring
4743840	4748160	somebody else like conveyor belt and you're up for days at a time. And as soon as there's any
4748160	4752400	discrepancy and was the movie you and I went to see, was it Amelie or was it the Southern movie?
4752400	4757120	Oh, why were you lying about what movie you saw with Chris? And then it's like, okay, so now
4757120	4762640	they have 10, this is 10 times you lied to us. Look at, you're not a trustee. It's very easy
4762640	4767760	when someone hasn't slept, when every little slight details being examined, and the guy's just a
4767760	4774400	fresh one through the door. And the thing is, the interrogators often knew this guy hasn't done
4774400	4778640	anything. It was just like, he's got a job to do to get you to sign that piece of paper.
4779280	4782640	And the quicker we could do this, the quicker we could get on with our lives.
4782640	4788640	There's a study that was done on TSA agents in airports. And what they wanted to see was,
4789360	4796720	if given a outcome, will people retrofit reality in order to be able to achieve it?
4796720	4803440	So the original study was actually faces that were either angry or happy. And there was 100
4803440	4808560	images and you had to pick between them angry, happy, happy, happy, angry, angry. But after the
4808560	4814240	first 50 images, it was only angry images. But people still kept on picking happiness out of
4814240	4820720	anger, even though it was quite obviously angry images, because they had a predetermined idea
4820720	4825200	that this is something that I should be searching for. And it was used to extrapolate out to a
4825200	4830160	question around TSA agents, which is that everybody has gone through the scenario of there being
4830160	4834560	nothing in their bag. And the security guy saying, we're going to have to open this up because
4834560	4837840	something's come up and you open it up. And he's like, there's nothing in here. I don't know what
4837840	4842880	could have come up. And you don't know if it appeared on the screen in a strange way or whatever.
4842880	4847840	But there would be a question to be asked. If every single person arrived at the airport with
4847840	4854000	their bags perfectly packed and no contraband or any of the other stuff in it, the TSA agents are
4854000	4858720	still likely to pick out issues within that, because that is what they're optimizing for.
4858720	4863440	That's the function that they're optimizing for. And it's kind of the same with regards to this.
4863440	4868960	Oh, yeah. And then it's even worse, because if you think about it this way, what if that TSA
4868960	4877440	agent is told 1% of the populace or the people coming through are potential terrorists? Like,
4877440	4882320	we know through our research in our studies, it's 1% or 0.5%, whatever small number. And then
4882320	4886960	you're as the TSA agent is putting everyone through. Well, if you put everyone through,
4886960	4892080	you're either grossly incompetent or maybe you're a potential terrorist because they would love to
4892080	4897920	work for the TSA. And now how do you disprove that you're a potential terrorist when the proof is
4898560	4903360	you're letting through literally every potential terrorist, right? You haven't
4903360	4908160	clagged one single person. So this must be by design. One or two, we can allow that's,
4908160	4911920	you know, negligent, whatever, every single potential terrorist you let through. What's
4911920	4918560	going on here, Mr. TSA agent? And that was part of the knife that was pointed to,
4918560	4922560	that was hanging over their heads. Yeah, there was this sort of damocles over pretty much everybody.
4923120	4929440	What was the scalping thing? Yeah, so they were very creative with their tortures. One of them
4929440	4935360	was they would tie a rope around someone's like head. I don't think this was done very commonly.
4935360	4938480	And then they would have like a stick attached to it and they would turn it until just basically
4938480	4946240	the skin off top of their head popped off. To me, honestly, the psychological tortures
4946880	4954720	were much more horrific because we can all wrap our heads thanks to Hollywood about like people
4954720	4959760	just being beaten and fingernails put off and someone dislocates your shoulder. We've seen those
4959760	4964080	movies, you know, where the actor is just getting the crap kicked out of them and job broken and
4964080	4972720	whatever. You don't dare show even in like a silence of the lambs context, a movie where
4973360	4979600	someone is brought in and their kid, if that kid is being shown hostage in a movie,
4979600	4984640	he's going to get saved, right? They're not going to show that you sign the confession and they
4984640	4989600	shoot the kid anyway. Well, what was that general secretary Stanislav Kozia? Well, that was the
4989600	4996560	hardest, the hardest scene. That was the worst scene in the book? I think Peter Fector might be
4996560	5003440	the worst, but this was the one where, because he's also a very evil person, right? Stanislav
5003440	5011840	Kozior. And he was head of Ukraine. Stalin brought him to Moscow and made him like a second
5011840	5016960	in command or gave him a major position like in January, I think of 38, and by May he's arrested.
5017760	5024480	And we don't know exactly what the tortures were done to him, but he was a good Bolshevik, strong,
5024480	5028080	you know, Stalin means man of steel. They pride themselves in their ruthlessness.
5028080	5032320	And this is something the interrogators had to do. It's like, you're not going to feel sentimental
5032320	5035680	because this enemy of the people is being tortured. What kind of person are you, right? Like,
5035680	5040640	you're a strong Soviet and, you know, they could have kept him up all night. They could have
5040640	5046000	thrown cold water. Who knows what they'd pulled. There was one Russian military guy where they
5046000	5049920	pulled out all his teeth. And then when he was pardoned, they gave him steel teeth and he was
5049920	5054640	instrumental in fighting the Nazis during World War II. And Stalin was like, oops, sorry, buddy.
5056320	5063520	And the thing with that scene is, you know, they did something to him which was not done to many
5063520	5070800	other people as far as my research indicates. And the question is, when the tortures reach this kind
5070800	5077600	of apex of torture, is it something that they always had in the back of their minds? We don't
5077600	5083680	want to go there, but we know we can do it. Or is it that this guy is a major name? We have to
5083680	5089600	break him and we have to go into uncharted territory. Were they letting him think he's going to
5090240	5095680	out with them? Or were they like, was he actually doing it? Was he like going for, you know, like,
5095680	5102800	what's his name in Gitmo? Khalid, he was like, waterboard like 20 times with some crazy number,
5102800	5106720	which no one had ever done before. They're like, this guy is just like a beast, right?
5106720	5113520	So at a certain point, they brought in his teenage daughter and raped her in front of him.
5113520	5119360	And then he broke. And when you read, you know, even though the guy's a monster, he was complicit
5119360	5125280	in the genocide of the Ukrainians and, you know, just many tortures under his name, just to kind of
5126400	5130800	try to get into his head to be like, I don't care what these people are going to do to me.
5130800	5135840	I'm innocent. Let me talk to Stalin. You know, you know, I know how this works. I'm a proud
5135840	5140560	Bolshevik. I never would never betray the people like spitting his blood in their faces.
5140560	5143600	And then she comes in, it's like, what's she doing here? And he's like, oh, you're innocent,
5143600	5148240	huh? Okay. And then he just saw, and the thing is she killed herself. He got, he outlived her.
5148240	5154880	She threw herself in front of a train. And that's the kind of thing where when people
5154880	5162960	think of oppression in the West, we think solitary confinement, cops not letting you sleep,
5162960	5168240	they're being the crap out of you, they're breaking your limbs. I think all of that is
5168240	5177200	something that would be excruciating, no question for us. But when you're watching someone assault
5177200	5182720	your kids and no, they're not going to have any consequences for it. And like, that's a wrap
5182720	5189200	for you. And it's just like, we don't know. None of us in the West, I think,
5190080	5196160	under, except under maybe ridiculous circumstances, can appreciate that sense of powerlessness.
5197040	5202800	Like even as someone with solitary confinement, shout out to Ross Albrecht, can still write
5202800	5210240	letters to people, receive information, you know, read a book or something. There's a little bit
5211040	5220400	of sovereignty. And that, which is just so obscene in like almost a spiritual sense,
5221200	5226560	is, and the thing is, our heads would never go there. Like we don't think in terms like this.
5227120	5235200	And they were just very, the Soviets were very, very conniving and crafty in their machinations.
5235200	5248240	Why was this extreme paranoia, overbearing police and secret service involvement,
5248240	5253040	heavy use of cold cellars and hot cellars, learning about that as well, was pretty
5253040	5257600	fucking awful. 16 men locked in a room where it was so small that you couldn't even touch
5257600	5261040	the ground. And the only thing worse than that was the cold cellar, which was basically where
5261040	5265200	you were left to freeze in this super cold Siberian winter.
5265200	5269120	They put you in a no, they put you in a pit, like basically like a basement and they threw ice water
5269120	5275920	on you naked. Not good. Yeah. Why? Why do you do the cold plunges? That's true. That's true.
5275920	5279120	Maybe I'd have loved it. They're a coup. Maybe I'd have loved it now. It's cool. Yeah. Just without
5279120	5286720	the psychedelics and the catamine. Why is all of this happening? Why is it? Why are there quotas
5286720	5295200	for how many criminals need to be found? Is this an inevitable byproduct of
5297200	5304240	trying to search for revolution? Is this because of internal corruption? Is this
5304240	5308800	cultural within the political elite? Like what's driving this type of strategy?
5308800	5315600	There's several things. And to be clear, not every decade of the Soviet Union was as bad as
5315680	5319200	this. This was the great Stalin's great terror in the late 30s.
5320960	5329200	Part of it is if you look at an axis between collectivism and individualism, a big part of
5329200	5336080	collectivism is to make sure that no individual has too much power. And we can understand that
5336080	5343360	thing. A lot of people would be uncomfortable with Trump or Soros or Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos
5343360	5349440	being like, all right, this guy is accountable to no one. He's untouchable. I can understand that
5349440	5356640	kind of argument. But when you extrapolate that nationwide and you make it so that no individual
5356640	5362560	has any power, everyone is only a function of society, what that means in practice is,
5363360	5366720	again, things like this, where you were just completely powerless and helpless,
5366720	5372640	and that's by design. That's number one. Number two is Stalin's goal was
5375520	5382480	to have it as public, greater good for society as possible. So anything private
5383520	5391040	was a threat to his vision. But what that means is if me and you are friends or your parents,
5391680	5398080	these are private bonds as opposed to public bonds for everyone. And right away, that is
5398080	5405120	the first step toward a conspiracy. Because if your loyalty is to your dad as opposed to society,
5405120	5409920	well, I can't have that because everyone has to be working for everybody else. And especially
5409920	5415120	someone like him, Stalin, who was personally very paranoid, any kind of organization,
5415840	5422400	whether it's a classroom, a factory, neighborhood, if they're working together,
5422960	5428960	that's a private society as opposed to the public society. So he did everything in his power to
5428960	5436800	atomize Soviet society as much as possible and to have people look at each other, to have this be a
5437360	5445360	as low trust of society as possible, that you don't know who is going to turn you in for what,
5446080	5452080	and to have enormous incentives for people to turn in their neighbors, colleagues, family members,
5452960	5457760	co-workers, and so on and so forth, to maintain their status, just to maintain their homes.
5457760	5462720	There were jokes. Russians had these things called anikdote, where you could use humor to say
5462720	5466960	things that were otherwise unspeakable, where people had to live in apartments together with
5466960	5471440	other families. And all it would take is a phone call to the secret police and be like,
5471440	5478880	he's a kulak, or he's hoarding gold. And the joke was like, oh, my gosh, we turned in Masha,
5478880	5484320	but Dasha has a better room. But all it would take is a phone call, they vanish,
5484320	5489520	and now you've got their space. And so the incentives are there, especially if not everyone's
5489520	5497040	a good roommate. It seems like a lot of this story was either perpetuated,
5497040	5499040	created, or driven by Stalin. Yes.
5501600	5507840	What is he as a man? Is he evil? Is he captured by an ideology?
5508640	5516640	He was nowhere near as much of an ideologue as Lenin. So that is real. And he was a thug.
5516640	5521360	He came up as a bank robber, like a hooligan. He was not some kind of,
5522000	5529440	like Trotsky is very much the intellectual vision of the communist. And despite people
5529440	5533280	making excuses for Trotsky, as we saw with, I talk about the Kronstadt rebellion,
5533280	5537520	he had no problem putting people up against the wall who got in his way. So the reason he didn't
5537520	5542080	kill as many people Stalin is because he got deposed and deported. So when he's in the depths of
5542160	5546160	Mexico, plowing free to callow, he's not in a position to really be ordering
5546960	5555520	rapes and executions. So it was very heavily influenced by Stalin. But again, everything
5555520	5561280	that he did, there's in the West, when all this stuff became verified, especially by Khrushchev's
5561280	5564560	secret speech in 56, where he's like, yeah, all this stuff about Stalin is true. And when you
5564560	5568480	hear it coming from the guy who's exceeded Stalin as opposed to Western capitalist propaganda,
5568480	5573200	you're like, oh crap, we got to look at this square in the face instead of sweeping on the rug.
5573200	5580640	It's kind of like all the things that Stalin did, Lenin had implemented. And Emma Goldman,
5580640	5584480	Alexander Berkman made that clear at the time before Stalin was even in power.
5585840	5587680	Also, something that happened...
5587680	5589360	Wait, no, they did it after Stalin was in power.
5589360	5589680	Sorry.
5589680	5594960	89 was when the Berlin Wall fell. So it was a year after I was born. So for me, I didn't know
5595920	5600320	what it meant. I didn't know where it ran. I didn't know why it happened. I didn't realize that
5600320	5604240	there was actually four quadrants to Germany. It had been split up between, was it the French,
5604800	5608240	Russians, British, who's the other one? Americans.
5608240	5611280	And the Americans, right, whatever. I don't know, you got a bit of Germany. I can't remember it.
5612160	5615680	I read a very big book in not very much time, okay? Like, give me a break.
5617680	5623600	You talk about the absurdity of splitting not only a country, but a city in half.
5625920	5632800	Did you look at what the process of that occurring was like, the creation of a wall,
5632800	5638560	the building of a wall where me that lives on this street and you that lives two streets in
5638560	5641680	that direction are now completely apart?
5641680	5644880	Yeah. That was one of the things that was interesting when I was writing that chapter.
5646080	5651360	And how I framed it is, it would have been considered unthinkable because no one had
5651360	5657760	ever thought of it before. How do you disintegrate a city? The whole point of a city or one of the
5657760	5663680	big points is I can get easily from point A to point B. Everyone's physically close.
5663680	5668800	Here's the government sector. Here's the business sector. Here's the cultural center.
5668800	5674000	And they're all, you know, in proximity to one another. You don't need a car in most cities
5674000	5680400	or certain cities, and everything's just integrated. So it's like, what if you wanted to kind of
5680480	5685120	Manhattan, you know, take Times Square, but now Times Square is a separate country.
5686080	5690960	It's like, we would have to sit down and really do the math here. It's like, okay,
5690960	5696400	you can get there through the subway. You've got the streets. You've got these tall buildings.
5696400	5699760	Like some of the buildings are interconnected with these sky walks.
5699760	5705600	Like how would you separate this out? And they basically did this in East Germany.
5705600	5711760	They're like, all right, all these people, because West Berlin, excuse me, is wholly contained
5711760	5716400	within East Germany. I had thought as a kid, and I think a lot of Americans still think
5716400	5721360	that Berlin is right in the center of Germany. And when Germany is split into East Germany,
5721360	5725440	West Germany, it just got split in half. You had a wall right down the middle. It wasn't.
5725440	5731840	The entire city of Berlin is in East Germany and closer to Poland than it is to West Germany.
5731920	5736960	So they're like, all right, if you go from East to West German, West Berlin,
5736960	5741200	once you step foot in West Berlin, you're in West Germany, and you're basically free. And
5741200	5746640	all the people kept crossing that border. And they're like, we're losing people by the thousands.
5746640	5751280	And not just people, we're losing our like the brain drain. We're losing the engineers.
5751280	5754800	We're losing the doctors. We're losing the people who, you know, kind of are
5755520	5759200	punching above their weight in terms of production. And they're like, all right,
5759200	5765120	we're going to separate out the city into two halves. And you have to worry about the sewers.
5765120	5767840	People are going to sneak it through the sewers. You have to worry about the streets.
5767840	5774800	You have to worry about, you know, water pipes. Like every aspect that integrates a city,
5774800	5780320	they had to figure out how are we going to disintegrate this subway lines. And they did it.
5780320	5786560	And the thing is, when they did it like overnight, the first elements, even in America,
5787040	5790480	President Kennedy didn't really know what to make of it, because they never entered their
5790480	5794400	head that someone would try to do something like this, because it's not like Berlin is small.
5794400	5798720	So to encompass a city within a wall, like imagine someone even encompassing
5798720	5804000	like Austin in a wall, it's like, what? Like this wall would be just gigantic and it would
5804000	5810160	take forever. And they did it. And people started losing their lives, trying to cross,
5810160	5814480	you know, very, very quickly. And the stories that I love that chapter a lot,
5815360	5822240	because there's a lot of just very dark moments where people just want to cross the street so
5822240	5826480	they could celebrate their birthday with their sister and they get shot. But there's also moments
5826480	5831920	where people are like, I'm going to do something about this, you know, and escaping and just use
5831920	5836720	their ingenuity to kind of give a, you know, my favorite story is the one with the sports car.
5836720	5839920	I love that story. Hans Mechster, I think, is the name.
5839920	5843680	Yeah. So before that, what was the citizens escape tunnel?
5844960	5846400	You mean with the college kids?
5846400	5847440	It was elderly people.
5847440	5848800	Oh, the senior citizens tunnel.
5848800	5849920	Senior citizens escape tunnel.
5849920	5855840	Yeah. So the senior citizens tunnel, Andrew Heaton told me this story. I'm
5855840	5861760	very grateful to him. Basically, there was a chicken coop in East, I always cry,
5861760	5866560	I always lose it when I tell this story. And you tell so many times you think you're going to
5866560	5870720	be able to tell it calmly and you never can, or at least I can't, because they were a bunch of
5870720	5876320	senior citizens, old people, and they dug this tunnel from East Berlin to West Berlin, and they
5876320	5881680	dug it six feet tall, and which is going to take a lot longer than something across space.
5882240	5887600	And they asked this old guy, why you guys built this tunnel so tall? And he said,
5887600	5892080	my wife's done crawling. So it's just this beautiful thing that they all got out.
5893760	5894320	Isn't that great?
5895280	5898080	Fucking amazing. What about the sports car? What about?
5898080	5899440	Oh, God, it's a great story.
5899440	5904080	Unbelievable. So I think his name is Hans Meixner. Please double check it on this.
5904880	5908960	He fell in love. He was one of the people who was commuting between East and West Berlin,
5908960	5912480	because you still had, thanks to the post-World War II laws,
5912480	5914800	you were allowed to cross the border if you're a certain type of citizen.
5915520	5921040	And he fell in love with an East German girl. And he's like, all right, I got to get her ass to
5921040	5925600	West Germany. So he goes to Checkpoint Charlie, and you know, that's the big one,
5925600	5929280	that was the most famous. So the exchanges and shit happened, isn't it?
5929280	5933600	Yeah, it's like it was the big border crossing. And he looks at that bar, you know,
5933600	5936720	even nowadays, you have a parking garage, you pay the ticket, and the bar goes up,
5936720	5940960	and allows the car to go through. And as the guys, you know, he's making his crossing,
5940960	5944960	he very carefully measures it. And he's like, all right, this is how tall it is.
5944960	5949440	So he's like, I know what to do. I got to find a car that would fit under this bar,
5949440	5952480	and I could just drive under it. So he finds, I think, was an Astrid Martin.
5952480	5958880	It was a British car, I remember. He rents it. He puts the girlfriend in the back seat.
5958880	5961760	And he's like, well, if I'm going to flee with her, I got to bring mom along.
5961760	5964800	He brings the mother-in-law. And then he packs a ton of bricks.
5964800	5968720	He puts her in the trunk with bricks in case they start shooting her, right?
5969280	5973680	And so there were two points where you have to check. He gets passed through the first guard,
5973680	5976880	the guard waves into the second point. And instead of going to the second point,
5976880	5980560	because he had taken out the windshield also, he just, and he took out some air from the tires.
5980560	5987600	He floors it, drives under the bar, and makes his way to freedom. And as I put in the book,
5987600	5990320	you would think that the guards would just stand there shaking their fists. They weren't because
5990320	5994800	they didn't know what the hell had just happened. And they got married. And it's this beautiful,
5996960	6002560	that's the other thing about the white pill. There are so many moments where even in this kind
6002560	6009120	of nightmare countries, there are these few just random, everyday citizens who were just like,
6009120	6018000	I'm going to find my happy ending. And they do it over and over and over again. And I just love,
6018000	6022160	and they actually recreated, there's a photo, an aerial photo of them recreating that picture
6022160	6027360	where he's in the wheel, she's in the back seat, mother-in-laws in the trunk with the bricks.
6027360	6031600	And there's a sequel to the story, because another guy did that same thing.
6031600	6032800	He didn't take the windscreen off.
6032800	6035920	But he read through the same car. I love it.
6041760	6048240	Okay, we've spoken about a lot of the brutality. There's been some small glimmers of hope.
6049360	6050640	What are the big glimmers of hope?
6054560	6055760	What do you mean?
6056240	6068800	Well, you've got this essentially overnight fall of death throes of this culture philosophy
6068800	6075200	institution that's been going on forever. And it is brought about by two conservatives in the US
6075200	6084000	and the UK and a Russian. And it would have been almost unthinkable. It was unthinkable the day
6084000	6088160	before. Your man said it was unthinkable the day before, but then it evidently wasn't.
6088160	6091360	Yeah, if you look at Star Trek, what's the name? Chekhov?
6092160	6098000	The idea is, you had the Korean War, which was a draw. You had the Vietnam War,
6098000	6102800	which was a complete disaster for the West. And it was certainly not a victory for the West.
6103520	6107680	In the 70s, the argument was like, all right, look,
6107760	6112400	Soviet Union is not going anywhere. They're not they're not doing great, but they're certainly not
6113840	6118080	this is this is the reality. If you want to be realistic, instead of thinking they're going
6118080	6124160	anywhere, we have to realize we're going to be in a world with two superpowers. We have to make
6124160	6128800	nice with one another and understand one another, because otherwise the costs are going to be nuclear
6128800	6134160	war and world destruction. Neither party wants that. So instead of saber rattling, we need to sit
6134160	6139360	down and work things out because this is going to be the status quo, at least for another hundred,
6139360	6143360	even if we have warp speed, even if we have warp speed, right, even with the federation,
6143360	6148960	this is just the nature of a reality. And before he became president,
6150000	6157360	Ronald Reagan sat down with one of his advisors and he goes, my policy for the Cold War is simple
6157360	6165120	and some would even say simplistic, we win, they lose. And that kind of approach of
6167520	6176240	this is not I'm not going to live on his earth where this sort of thing is going to be normalized.
6176800	6182560	But the thing is that you're and Reagan really weren't interested in bringing down the Soviet
6182560	6190720	Union as their primary goal. Reagan especially his big interest was ending the threat of nuclear war.
6191600	6198000	And there's this couple of scenes that I uncovered in the research, because you know,
6198000	6202800	they're playing poker, you know, the US and the USSR, right? They both have to act one way in public
6202800	6207040	another way in private, neither wants to kill each other, neither wants to be killed. Like,
6207040	6213200	you know, this is you're playing Brinksmanship. And they bring Reagan down to show him the
6214160	6219760	how you retaliate if there's a nuclear strike. And his aides thought they're like, he's not going to
6220880	6226880	do it. And he talked about this in the sense of like, wait a minute. So if I retaliate,
6227520	6235360	then within minutes, literally millions, if not tens of millions of Russians are who are innocent
6235360	6241280	people, who whose only crime was being born on the far side of the Iron Curtain, which they can't
6241280	6247040	leave. And when I retaliate, I'm going to be killing all of them. And he's like, I'm the president.
6247040	6252640	I'm the most powerful man in the world. And I'm the good guy. I'm killing in minutes, tens of
6252640	6257120	millions of people. It made no sense to him. And the but the beautiful part is Gorbachev
6257840	6262800	is taken down into the bunker. And he's dropped and thrown the rehearsal. And they go, okay, Mr.
6263120	6266800	General Secretary, if this happens, this is the button you press. And he goes,
6266800	6270800	I'm not pressing that button even for practice purposes. And he's like, if they strike us too
6270800	6276800	bad. But neither of them knew the other had this position. And what's fascinating is Thatcher,
6276800	6281920	who was PM at the time, Prime Minister of Great Britain, she gets a lot of heat very correctly
6281920	6287440	for being a scold. The first time she met Gorbachev, he came to checkers before he was
6287440	6292560	out of the Soviet Union. You know, she wanted to meet him, which was it's the Prime Minister's
6292560	6296400	like summer house, whatever they call it, something the equivalent of Camp David here.
6296400	6300480	And they're coming to breakfast, and she's yelling at him about their economics, and she's yelling
6300480	6303760	at him about their foreign policy, and she's yelling him about their foreign rights. And then
6303760	6308320	she's human rights. And then she's yelling him that he hasn't touched his breakfast. And Gorbachev
6308320	6315600	just stops and he goes, you know, I wasn't sent here to convert you to communism, like I have my
6315600	6320240	own views. So let's just take it down a notch. And she just burst out laughing. But what she doesn't
6320240	6325920	get credit for was her sent to diplomacy. Because she and she boasted about this constantly and
6325920	6330960	fairly. She was the one who spotted him. She said she made him. Well, she took credit for it.
6330960	6336720	She went on the BBC and said, I could do business with Mr. Gorbachev. And because both of them,
6336720	6341040	Reagan and Thatcher were on the right wing of the right wing parties in each country,
6341040	6345520	that gave them the space to be diplomatic. I mean, when you think of Thatcher,
6345520	6351280	you think of the opposite of diplomacy. She, you know, never had a fight she didn't like.
6351280	6355280	She was always throwing hands at Prime Minister's questions. She was always going after members
6355280	6360240	of her own cabinets. She called them a wets, which in contemporary terms is like calling someone a
6360240	6364400	soy boy. These were like her own, because it's like he's all wet, right? Doesn't that mean Britain?
6364960	6369520	Like she called them that. And, you know, she said she did not suffer fools gladly,
6369520	6374480	but they both independently sat down with Gorbachev and they're like, all right,
6374480	6381040	like this, this status quo, rather than being perpetual is intolerable. We cannot live in this
6381040	6387520	world. Reagan and Gorbachev thought this very strongly, where we have Lord knows, even we don't
6387520	6393520	know how many nuclear missiles are pointed at one another, and that God forbid, you know,
6393520	6398400	someone gets angry or something happens. And within 20 seconds, all life on earth is destroyed.
6398400	6405200	This, this, this can't happen. And together, you know, they sat down and gave Gorbachev the space
6405200	6411360	to demilitarize. And the thing is, when you have these kind of regimes, and I think Gorbachev
6411360	6416080	really ends up being the hero of the book, because there were so many times when people were on the
6416080	6421840	phone with him from other countries, other communist countries, and saying, General Secretary,
6421840	6425760	it's all going to shit, you need to send the tanks. And he goes, no, I'm not doing it. And to
6425760	6430800	me, you know, people often talk about like what, what's beauty and beauty could be like a beautiful
6430800	6435840	woman. It could be like a sunset. It could be, you know, a song that throws your heart. To me,
6435840	6443360	beauty that really kind of gets me really in a very primal emotional way is when these extremely
6443360	6448800	powerful people choose to take their hand off the trigger and are like, I'm not going to be
6448800	6453360	killing people. I don't care if it's going to cost me personally. It's just a wrong thing to
6453360	6457760	do. I'm not going to be on the side of the executioners. And there were so many moments
6458320	6464800	in this book, Lithuania being a major example, where they're begging him to use force, and
6464800	6470800	they're telling him correctly, if you do not, Mr. Gorbachev, if you do not send in the tanks,
6470800	6476000	like this, this system that you grew up in that makes the Soviet Union, the rival to the United
6476000	6481520	States is all going to fall apart. And he's like, too bad, like it's going to go peacefully.
6482400	6486640	And there's a great scene in East Germany, where Hanukkah, you know, who's the dictator
6486640	6490480	of East Germany is watching the footage of these marches. And he's like, all right,
6490480	6494320	we got to do something. We need to know the Tiananmen Square. And the head of the military,
6494320	6499920	who is no dove, no soy boy. I mean, this guy has a lot of blood in his hands, a lot of regression.
6499920	6505600	He goes, he basically, can I curse? He basically says, fuck you, we're not doing anything.
6505600	6509920	This is going to resolve peacefully. And Hanukkah was out of office the next day.
6509920	6516800	So that's the other like white pill moment. Like it's not that there are lots of times
6516800	6521120	when genuinely evil people, when people who have a lot of blood on their hands,
6521840	6527360	have done a lot of atrocities for one reason or another, maybe not voluntarily, because the chips
6527360	6533040	are not in their favor, where they're like, okay, I'm out. This is my limit. And I'm not going to
6533120	6537680	make things worse, even if just from personal sense of self-preservation, where it's like,
6537680	6542240	if I pull this trigger, my bullets in my head next, so I'm going to back away. If that's their
6542240	6545840	motivation, I'm fine with it. The most important, but the thing is with Gorbachev, it wasn't his
6545840	6550080	motivation. He genuinely was like, all right, he spent enough time with the West as opposed to other
6550800	6557200	people who became in leadership roles in Soviet Union, where he's like, he went to, in 68, there
6557200	6561440	was a kind of a softening of communism in Czechoslovakia. There's something called the Prague
6561440	6566480	Spring, Dupček, who was head of Czechoslovakia, wanted to implement socialism with the human face.
6566480	6570720	When Gorbachev went to visit Czechoslovakia not long after that, and the Russians sent the tanks
6570720	6574960	and took him out of office, he went to a factory, and the factory workers literally turned their
6574960	6580960	backs on him to just give him a show of like, you were evil. And to see that, when you're like,
6580960	6586480	I'm just here to help you run your factory, I'm like this nobody middle, aporacic. And to see,
6586800	6591680	we were told in our newspapers that you were happy that we were liberating or saving the
6591680	6596160	revolution Czechoslovakian. And I see the workers, and any of these workers would pull a bullet in
6596160	6601120	me if they had their druthers. That was a very eye-opening moment for him. And he's like, I
6601120	6607440	don't want to be that guy. And what does power mean if not the ability to say, you know what,
6607440	6613520	I'm not going to use this power? But could you imagine if instead of getting a Gorbachev,
6613520	6618560	you got another Stalin? Well, they had that. I mean, Brezhnev wasn't another Stalin, but
6618560	6622800	the fact that he sent in the tanks in 68 and Prague, the fact that the Hungarian rebellion
6622800	6627680	in I think it was 56, it was 13 days where the Hungarians were like, all right, we're leaving
6627680	6634000	the Warsaw Pact, and Khrushchev's like, that's cute. And they hung Imre Nagy, who was the prime
6634000	6639440	minister, you know, so yeah, you don't need, that's the other scary thing. When you have systems like
6639440	6646400	this, you don't need another, like everyone, it's going to be very hard to get into Stalin's seat
6646400	6650240	without being another Stalin, because you're going to have to get through all these kind of filters.
6651360	6655440	I've had two conversations in the last month, one with Schultz and one with Goggins,
6655440	6660160	and I asked both of them. I find it interesting asking people similar questions. I like to get
6660160	6668560	the different response to the same prompt. And both of them have had long relationships going on
6668560	6673840	Joe's show and asked them both about what's it like, you know, being friends with Rogan and sort
6673840	6678640	of observing what's been going on and so on and so forth. And both of them have said basically the
6678640	6685920	same thing, which is kind of this very odd situation where somebody that has the most power is the
6685920	6692960	person that's the most benevolent with it, the person who is giving and is prepared to use their
6693040	6700880	platform to be able to raise others up, so on and so forth. And yeah, it seems to me like I
6700880	6705520	were both good friends with Michaela. Michaela, for the people that don't know, is named after
6705520	6713040	Gorbachev. That's why Jordan called her Michaela. I'm not kidding when I said, when I thought to
6713040	6722000	myself, why? Why name your daughter after this male Russian dude? I didn't know up until I read this
6722000	6732720	book any difference between Stalin and Beria and Gorbachev. They're all Russian guys that ran the
6732720	6737200	country. Maybe they did some bad things. Maybe they did some good things. I don't know. It kind
6737200	6744480	of makes sense. I didn't know either. So when I had this weird western look at the end of the Cold War
6744480	6750560	and I thought Reagan and Thatcher were going to be the heroes, and as I was writing it, when you
6750560	6755200	write a book, some of them the characters write themselves, it's very clear he's the hero of the
6755200	6760240	three of them. Not that they didn't do heroic things, but in terms of the person who sacrificed
6760240	6766400	the most, who was most committed to peace, who had the most opportunity to turn things in a very bad
6766400	6773040	direction. He's not an angel, let me be clear, but in terms of the amount of good things and choices
6773040	6780000	he made in the area of peace, it's just off the charts. So I can very easily see now, having written
6780000	6787440	the book, why he did this. And I had no idea why, having previously written this book, he would have
6787440	6792720	done it. So you say it is possible that those of us who fight for the dignity of mankind will lose
6792720	6797360	our fight. It is not possible that we must lose our fight. That is the white pill.
6797360	6802960	Well, thanks for spoiling the book, Chris. Sorry, the final line and you revealed that it was Michael
6802960	6812000	Malis all along. Yeah. Yeah. What's that mean? It means that hope doesn't mean that nothing bad
6812000	6818560	happens. Hope doesn't mean, you know, someone once yelled at me like, how can you, you're talking
6818560	6822880	about the white pill, but you moved from New York, you were adjourned from New York to go to Austin.
6823520	6832720	I'm like, yeah, I'm not saying nothing bad ever happens. I'm saying that the idea that the good
6832720	6839840	guys are these omnipotent deities and you're completely powerless against them and they're
6839840	6845040	all knowing and all powerful and they're always going to win. It's like, but that's not true.
6845040	6850400	First of all, no matter how evil you think they are, as I demonstrate in this book, they're much
6850400	6857200	worse. Like I didn't realize just how evil the Soviet Union was until I read this book.
6857920	6863920	And again, this is the North Korea guy. Like it's so much bigger and worse than I had realized
6863920	6871120	and I have all the receipts in it. But also the fact that you don't, if you as the reader don't
6871120	6877840	always get what you want, why are you ceding to them this view that they always get what they want?
6877840	6883200	You know what I mean? Like if I'm just to use an absurd example, if I'm Stalin and I want a dinosaur,
6883200	6886800	like a living dinosaur, I can't get that right because dinosaurs extinct. That's just one extreme
6886800	6892800	example. But I can't just defy laws of economics. I can't just snap my fingers and say, okay,
6892800	6897280	everyone's going to be fed. I also can't snap my fingers and say, everyone who dislikes me is
6897280	6902560	going to be identified by me. I'm not going to be able to do that either. So this claim that they
6902560	6908320	can always win just because they've got the... First of all, the person who's got the most
6908320	6912400	numbers always wins. What about the George Washington? George Washington's entire career
6912400	6919520	was retreating from the British. We won. Vietnam. Afghanistan, number one. Number two is just
6920320	6927040	this kind of premise that just because some organization has been at it for a long time,
6927040	6932640	like if you're starting out on third base, that's a huge advantage. Does everyone who's
6932640	6937280	on third base make it home? No. And you wouldn't say that. And anyone said that would be absurd.
6937280	6945840	So the fact that there are, again, so many examples of things that could have gone so much worse,
6945840	6950640	but they didn't. And it's not because these were angels. It's not like, like you said,
6950640	6955200	it wasn't like one year at Brezhnev, then Mother Teresa comes in, right? It's not like Reagan was
6955200	6960240	an angel. It's not like that was an angel hardly. It's not like the people in West Berlin were all
6960240	6965200	these kind of saints or the people in East Berlin were all saints or vice versa. These were human
6965200	6970720	beings and human beings, as we talked earlier, are finite. There's limits to our knowledge.
6970800	6976480	There's limits to our abilities. And at a certain point, the costs outweigh the benefits. Look at
6976480	6981680	the Confederacy, right? When Lee surrendered, there were lots of people in the former Confederacy
6981680	6985360	who were like, we're just going to keep fighting forever. But at a certain point,
6985360	6989440	you have to look at it and be like, all right, I can't win this fight. So just out of a sense of
6989440	6993440	self preservation, I'm just going to be like, all right, it's a wrap. And that's what happened
6993440	6997200	in many of these countries. And that is what I think is going to happen at a certain point
6997920	7002480	with 11 elements in the West, that the costs are just going to be too much for them to bear
7002480	7009840	and they're just going to fold. To claim that the foes of human decency are uniquely brave
7009840	7013600	and valorous, to me is another just blatant one of their lies.
7015280	7018560	What do you think most people misunderstand about evil?
7018560	7028960	I think there's two things. One is, I think Americans, in the political sense,
7030000	7036160	think an evil person has a weird mustache and is banging the desk, right? They really think it,
7036720	7040480	you know, I talk about this in the book where there's this, I think it was, I forget who wrote
7040480	7044880	the poem was Leonard Cohen, about, you know, one of these Nazis, height normal, eyes normal,
7044880	7048320	hair normal. It's like, what do you expect? Things like people really, even though even
7048320	7052480	religious people who understand that the devil is seductive, still expect the devil to be walking
7052480	7058000	with hooves and horns. Like that's not how you look at, who was that the serial killer in
7059440	7064000	Florida who was played by that? Jeffrey Dahmer? No, the one in Florida who killed all those women
7064800	7071840	who just looked like, trust me, we're both going to feel stupid later. Anyway,
7071920	7074880	people are screaming into their iPods at the moment. Yes, they are. And he was played by that actor
7074880	7079920	with the Zac Efron. Ted Bundy? Ted Bundy. Ted Bundy, you couldn't pick him out. If anything,
7079920	7084880	he's good looking, right? You just think he's like a normal guy. So people understand that
7084880	7088560	intellectually, but they don't really understand it emotionally. So that's one thing. Second is,
7089200	7097520	I don't think people appreciate how sophisticated evil can get when it comes systematized.
7098240	7103840	So again, when we think of like political evil, we think of like, again, the government brutality,
7103840	7108400	like the cops are beating you up in your cell or you're putting the solitary, they are not
7108400	7113280	thinking of the evil when it comes not to those who have been identified as criminals,
7113280	7117600	but to those who are not criminals, not even accused of criminals and the oppression
7117600	7123840	that can happen in that regard. And I don't think they appreciate how comfortable
7124720	7131520	evil is in taking hostages. So you think, you know, Christopher, there's nothing you could do,
7131520	7138960	I'm going to stand up. But when his family comes along, you'd fold in two seconds and you turn
7138960	7143440	me in and I wouldn't blame you. And I think the other thing that was turned out, turned up
7144320	7148640	in that chapter on the Stasi is people in this country, and I thought this as well,
7149600	7154240	were of the belief that those who were informants to the secret police, who snitched on their
7154240	7160560	friends, their coworkers, their neighbors, had a gun to their head themselves. So they bring in
7160560	7164800	Chris, they're like, all right, Chris, I need 10 names. And you're like, or we're going to kill
7164800	7169840	you and your family. It's like, all right, Michael, Zach, you know, blah, blah. What we don't realize
7169840	7176080	here in the West is a lot of these people were volunteered. They were more than happy. And one
7176080	7180320	of the Stasi recruiters point out, we didn't even pay them that much. It's like, they just wanted
7180320	7185440	to feel important, or they were bored, or they just felt they were doing the right thing. And that,
7185440	7194320	to me, is an element of evil that Americans are, I would say, almost entirely, but decreasingly
7194320	7199040	oblivious to. Well, how would you categorize that last? What's what Hannah Arendt calls the
7199040	7204800	banality of evil? Right. Maybe she's not using the term in the same way, but that's kind of like,
7204800	7211440	how commonplace it is. There's this one very disturbing scene in this, which I got from Anna
7211440	7217760	Funder. No, no, I got it from Timothy Geltnash, whose book is called The File. And both are great.
7217760	7222000	Anna Funder's book is called Stasi Land, I forget which is which. After East Germany fell, they
7222000	7228080	opened up the Stasi files. So you could go in, and you could see what information they had on you
7228080	7233440	and who turned you in. And this was a big moment for every East German to be like, do I want to know?
7234160	7238480	Or do I want to just look the other way and just pretend it never happened? Do I want to know?
7238480	7245840	What would you do? It depends on how, if I went to, so that's the thing, right? Some people had
7245840	7250880	gone to jail. Some people hadn't gone to jail. It may be just a curiosity thing. I think I would
7250880	7255120	probably, I don't know. I don't know. Anyone listening to this who says they would know,
7256160	7260160	it's, think about it for a second, because would you want to know that your brother-in-law
7260160	7264160	turned you in? On the one hand, you could say yes. On the other hand, you could say no, right?
7264160	7268160	It's not that simple. And the story in the book, there's a woman whose job there,
7269120	7273040	Frau Trumpleman, I think her name is, and the line the author has is, how do you work with
7273040	7278240	poison every day and not become poisoned yourself? Her job, when the people come in, is to sit them
7278240	7282480	down and basically walk them through. It's kind of like how they used to have, if you take an AIDS
7282480	7286640	test, you have to physically go to the doctor to get the results so he can be there to kind of
7286640	7289760	walk you through if it's positive, so you're not by yourself at home with a gun to your head.
7290560	7294960	And this woman came in and she had been in jail for, I think four or five years,
7295520	7301280	because she had wanted to leave East Germany. And she found out through reading her file
7301920	7306960	that it was the guy she's still living with. And she just lost it. And that morning,
7306960	7311040	you told her, have a nice day. How do you go home to that? And this is an entire country
7311280	7319120	of people like this. So those of us who say they'd rather know,
7322000	7328720	maybe I can see the case for both sides very easily. Would you want to know, ask yourself,
7328720	7335440	if one of your parents passed away and you learned that they were being unfaithful to your other
7335440	7339600	parent their entire lives, is that something you'd want to know? Or is that something where you're
7339600	7344720	like they're dead? I'd rather remember them as my dad or my mom than as someone who couldn't
7344720	7350720	keep in their pants. As opposed to a turn of resentment for no reason. Yeah. You have a quote
7350720	7356160	where you say, you should take one red pill and not the whole bottle. Yeah. What's the appropriate
7356160	7367440	dosage of white pills? It's one book at whitepillbook.com. That's good enough for me. Dude,
7368160	7375040	I can credit you with opening up an awful lot of my understanding around this sort of middle 1900
7376720	7385600	depths of human depravity, heights of human hope, complicity of journalists and state
7385600	7394640	enforcements in hiding awful and disgusting actions both within their own country and outside of it.
7395360	7402800	I have had a serious historical education from reading this and also you write beautifully.
7405200	7409600	The pacing, the way that you use your sentences, it's the same way that you speak.
7409600	7414880	I really, really genuinely, genuinely enjoyed it. There was a bunch of things. Just a little
7414880	7421040	passage about Lenin, who was widely regarded as a lunatic. Just the way that it's done,
7421040	7425920	it's the same way that you would speak it. I very, very much enjoyed it, especially given that I had
7426480	7432160	no background to it. Dude, congratulations. I talked to you, we were close friends throughout
7432160	7436880	the whole process of writing this book, and I talked to you a lot about how it was really
7436880	7442880	getting to me and how intense and emotional. Can't see why. These stories were both in
7442880	7447920	negative sense and the positive sense like the Hans Meichsner who drove the Speedster under the
7447920	7454480	thing, just so much darkness and so much beauty. I'm glad that you can see what I was going through
7456080	7460720	for the last couple of years. I think to me this was almost more like an exorcism
7461440	7472080	because there were just so many souls. The idea that they would just be forgotten and
7472560	7477680	stories swept in the rug, and I'm like, I'm going to do something about this. These people
7477680	7484800	need to be valorized and be remembered. Just so many innocent victims who just happened to
7484800	7490880	be born in the wrong place at the wrong time or looked at somebody the wrong way. I'm just so
7490880	7497120	glad that I'm in an opportunity to keep their memory alive.
7497200	7502240	You've done a commendable job, man. I think that they would all be incredibly grateful
7502240	7511520	for what you've done. How many references are there in this book? In fact, I can get it up right
7511520	7516720	now and find out because you've done it in Roman numerals, the way that the reference is.
7517280	7520800	In the Kindle, I think it's Roman numerals. In the hard cover, it's numbers.
7521760	7524640	I haven't ever seen Roman numerals go up this high.
7525680	7532080	I didn't know that... What's this? What page am I on here? This is page 341.
7533280	7542240	LD-E-X-X-V-I-L. LDL isn't L500?
7542800	7547520	Fuck knows. I don't know, but if I go all the way to the very, very end, it doesn't even tell me
7547600	7548640	it's still in...
7548640	7549200	Roman numerals?
7549200	7551920	It's still in fucking Roman numerals all the way to the end, so I don't know.
7551920	7556320	Lots, though. My point being that you've done a shit ton of research, it's incredibly impressive.
7558720	7562960	Looking at the stuff that you've got this from, where it's come from,
7562960	7569840	shit from the 1800s, random back catalog. Dude, it's very, very, very impressive,
7569840	7574880	especially given that I'm starting my journey of writing at the moment and observing somebody that
7574880	7577840	is... I mean, this is mastery, I think.
7577840	7582720	But I mean, this is... I'm not saying this to be glib. This isn't my first rodeo,
7582720	7590720	and I can't believe I pulled it off. It took me over two years, and if this was my first book,
7590720	7594320	I don't know that I'd be able to do it, like at all, because to...
7594320	7597360	Like trying to do your first bench session with 600 pounds?
7598080	7601040	I think it's... Honestly, it's like trying to do a bench in a squad at the same time.
7601600	7605440	No, no, and I'll tell you why. I'll tell you why it's a good metaphor,
7605440	7611920	because first of all, to even condense this much history into a book is just almost impossible.
7611920	7612960	Because it kept growing, right?
7612960	7617760	Right, and so it's under 400 pages, so to keep it to numbers is right.
7617760	7624640	But then also, to have it just the writing alone, to have history being written in a
7624640	7629280	conversational tone is almost impossible. Most history books are dry as hell,
7629280	7634880	and I wanted to make sure there's something that is readable, and also on a personal level.
7635680	7638560	When I... I've mentioned this when I was on Dave Smith.
7638560	7642240	When I was co-authoring books for celebrities, it's kind of like method acting, right?
7642240	7645680	You want to get into their head as much as possible, and that's something that I've taken
7645680	7652960	with me whenever I write my own books. But when I'm getting into the head of these people who
7652960	7657680	are being brutalized, or just that woman, that section was just copy and paste,
7657680	7662000	but just thinking about what that's like to go in and find out that your roommate or boyfriend,
7662000	7665680	it's not really clear, turned you in, and you're still living with this person,
7666480	7670880	I mean, it does a number on you, and it would do a number on anybody.
7672320	7673200	Are you glad that you're done?
7673520	7687840	I am... I'm right now in a very surreal space in a positive way, because it's...
7688640	7691120	So there were some issues with the publication when it came out,
7691760	7692240	on the first day.
7692240	7694080	There's no hard copies available at the moment, is that right?
7694080	7695840	It just takes like two weeks, but they're available.
7697680	7699920	There was an issue with the pricing on the first day, and I was like,
7700720	7704720	and if it had gone through a mainstream publisher, that would have just been a wash.
7705280	7708400	So it took a while for people to get their copies of the book.
7709120	7714880	And so I have the launch, I did Lex Friedman's show, and then it's kind of like radio silence,
7714880	7719120	right? Because I'd been working ever so long, and I was like, holy crap, it's DOA.
7720080	7726000	And I had to talk to our buddy Blair White, God bless her, and she's like, you've been so
7726560	7733760	trained by social media to have instant feedback that if you're not getting
7734320	7737920	results like that first day, you think it's done.
7737920	7740080	And she's like, this is... people haven't gotten their copies.
7740080	7742160	How are they going to be responding to it?
7742160	7745280	And that kind of clicked, but that kind of worked for a bit.
7745280	7751040	But now that these responses are coming in, there was a book that was published about
7751040	7754640	how Reagan won the Cold War by Dutton, which is a mainstream publisher.
7754640	7755760	I just found this out this morning.
7755760	7757840	Wall Street Journal called it one of the books of the year.
7757840	7759600	Amazon had as a staff pick.
7759600	7761120	I'm not selling him like three to one.
7762160	7767520	It's just... and doing... I haven't even started my podcast rollout.
7767520	7774560	So the fact that it's selling so well, so quickly, and getting responses from so many names,
7774560	7778560	because this... I know this always sounds like humble bragging, but I really...
7778960	7783120	This is such an important story to me.
7783120	7785600	And because this is my heritage, you were just a certain age,
7785600	7787120	you kind of look back where you came from.
7787120	7794560	The fact that I'm in my own best I can doing justice to so many people in so many countries
7794560	7801680	for so long, and making sure there's that line in The Iron Lady, where it's the young
7801680	7804960	Margaret Roberts is just yelling at Dennis, one's life must matter.
7805520	7811360	But to be able to sit there and be like, this is being forgotten,
7812000	7817360	and to be able to do something about it, and seeing that what I wanted to do about it
7817360	7822000	is getting done, it's almost like being in a dream.
7822000	7824480	Like to be able to change reality, to have that power.
7824480	7826320	It's just... I'm very, very blessed.
