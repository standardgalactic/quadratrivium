1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
If it's really the case that sex work is work, then what is the problem with being asked

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,480
by your boss to give him a blowjob?

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,480
It's work.

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,480
It's just a service.

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,560
It's like being asked to do it over time or make a coffee.

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,800
No one actually thinks that it's just like making a coffee.

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,800
Louise Perry.

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,800
Welcome on the show.

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,600
Thank you so much for having me.

10
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,280
Given your political background, how does it feel to have Ben Shapiro quote tweeting

11
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,280
your work?

12
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,240
I didn't know he had.

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,240
Did you not see this?

14
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,120
Let me tell you.

15
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:38,360
So there is a tweet that someone put out a couple of days ago explaining about how don't

16
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:45,040
kink shame the naked men doing parades in front of children and twerking in front of

17
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,720
cops.

18
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,240
And that was one photo, which was a news story.

19
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:55,640
And the other photo was the chapter list from your book, which said things like men

20
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,600
and women are different and loveless sex is not empowering.

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:06,880
And it said, people of the West choose your future, something like that.

22
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,880
Wow.

23
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,880
Okay.

24
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,880
Yeah.

25
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,880
Okay.

26
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,880
That explains things.

27
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:18,080
I have quite like a heavy notification filter on Twitter, so I don't always see everything.

28
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,480
The contents page though completely blew up like three months ago, long before the book

29
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,480
was published.

30
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:30,640
The publisher just put up online the cover, the title, the fact that Kathleen Stock wrote

31
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:37,200
the forward because she's got a kind of existing reputation among her haters, my haters, and

32
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,200
the contents page.

33
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,200
And that was enough to have like a several day Twitter storm.

34
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,200
Why do you think that was?

35
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,200
Those statements.

36
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,760
I mean, I guess because, I mean, I did write the chapters with the knowledge that they're

37
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:57,680
like, they're simultaneously obvious and also incredibly provocative, which was like

38
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,000
precisely my intention because some people read it.

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,920
I mean, some people read the whole book, but some people read the chapters in particular

40
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,960
and they're like, yeah.

41
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:15,240
And other people read them as like fascist, basically, I mean, like so politically outrageous.

42
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,000
I mean, I'd say that the response to the book so far has only been out for a couple

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,120
of weeks in the UK and not yet in the States is like 80% really positive and 20% complete

44
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,760
outrage and not very much in the middle.

45
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,240
I think, well, what do you think's going to happen when it comes out in America?

46
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,120
That's a good question.

47
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:42,360
I mean, the like the culture is more intense in America in every way.

48
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,040
It's so similar, I think, to what we have here.

49
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:51,560
I mean, actually, I think we import it really, but yeah, I don't know.

50
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:59,240
I mean, I did, like British political context is different from American, right?

51
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:05,120
And I write for the New Statesman magazine, for instance, which is like traditionally

52
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,280
left-wing outlet.

53
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,920
I have come from the left, even if I wouldn't necessarily consider myself still a part of

54
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,920
the left and so on.

55
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:18,440
So like, I hope the book doesn't just get treated as like yet another socially conservative

56
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:25,120
take on such revolution because even if I'm reaching some conservative conclusions, I'm

57
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,040
doing it via different priors, if that makes sense.

58
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,040
Yeah.

59
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,480
Well, didn't you say I start from feminist priors and end up with socially conservative

60
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,480
conclusions?

61
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:41,040
Yeah, some socially conservative conclusions, yeah, which means that there's sort of something

62
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,160
in it for everyone to hate.

63
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,160
Except Ben Shapiro, apparently.

64
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,560
He's not read the whole thing.

65
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,360
I'm not sure how he might think about some of the early chapters.

66
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,360
You've been co-opted by the right wing of America now, and this is your future.

67
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,680
So I was at the Heterodox Academy, Jonathan Heights organization, I was at the conference

68
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,680
for that this weekend.

69
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:09,240
One of the speakers said something that kind of, I think, sort of is a good synopsis of

70
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:14,040
the thesis of your book that says, there are many ways to change the world, few will make

71
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,000
it better, many will make it worse.

72
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,200
Yeah, it's true.

73
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,600
There's a real discretion quote like that.

74
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:28,560
I can't remember exactly how it's phrased, but something like, it's really easy to break

75
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:35,280
things and it's really hard to make things, which I think is, it's like a really fundamentally

76
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,160
conservative observation.

77
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,480
And true.

78
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,760
What's wrong with the sexual revolution then?

79
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:48,240
So my argument in the book is basically that there are some really important ways in which

80
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,640
men and women are different from one another.

81
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:55,360
So some of those differences are physical and should be fairly obvious.

82
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,640
Like only women can get pregnant, men are bigger and stronger than women are on average,

83
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,560
but also that the difference is massive between the, between the means.

84
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:11,320
And also there are psychological differences, which a lot of feminism of the last half century

85
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:19,600
or more has been really invested in minimizing, but I think definitely there, if you look

86
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,560
at the research, and it will see just look at the world around you.

87
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,560
One of those differences, for instance, is that male sexuality is different from female

88
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,000
sexuality on average, that men are more likely to be into things like casual sex, watching

89
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,120
porn, buying sex, all things that have become much more socially acceptable post sexual

90
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,600
revolution.

91
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:46,200
And my argument basically is that the sexual revolution was kicked off by the pill, and

92
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:52,480
the, which, which did a pretty good job of severing the link between sex and reproduction.

93
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,400
And it's kind of gave the impression that sex could just be a leisure activity that

94
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,840
didn't have to mean anything, it could just be sort of a bit of fun.

95
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,760
And my argument is actually that that idea that sex is just just a bit of fun, it doesn't

96
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:10,120
really mean anything, suit male interests much more than it does female, because casual

97
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:17,560
sex in particular is just one, one men wanting more than women do, and two women carry all

98
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:23,800
of the risks associated with it, like physical risks like pregnancy and violence and so on.

99
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,920
So my argument basically is it's a bad deal for them.

100
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,960
Originally, it was the sort of thing that was pushed by liberals and feminists, right?

101
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,520
This is exactly the sort of thing.

102
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,440
Yeah, yeah, I mean, the, yeah, so the, the popular narrative that I'm challenging is

103
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,080
one that the sexual revolution was like a feminist accomplishment.

104
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,480
And I don't think that's true.

105
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,360
I mean, which is not to say that there aren't some things about it that have been good for

106
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,680
women. I mean, I mean, if you look at the story of recent decades in particular, there

107
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,840
are all sorts of ways in which women are doing great actually, like women are women are going

108
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:59,560
to university more often than men are, they are right up until they have children are

109
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,760
doing better in the workplace.

110
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,800
You know, this is, it's not to say that like everything is like the battle of the sexes

111
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,840
women are like losing across the board, not at all.

112
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:14,280
But I think in terms of sexual culture, that I'm concerned, I'm concerned for women, I'm

113
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,240
also concerned for men.

114
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,320
I mean, there's a lot in the book about, for instance, the really malign influence of

115
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:27,400
porn on young men, like that in a superficial and short term way, it's great to be a really

116
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,800
attractive man in this sexual culture, right, you can basically attract as many partners

117
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,600
as you like, you know, consequence free sex is freely available to you.

118
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:43,400
But I think actually in the long run, that's not a very, that's not a happy way to live your life.

119
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,760
You say that your complaint is focused more against liberals than conservatives.

120
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,320
Why is that?

121
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,240
I mean, because I'm expecting liberals to read it, I might be wrong about that.

122
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:00,200
But I that that's the space that I'm coming from originally, I went to, I went to such

123
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,400
a left-wing university.

124
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,600
Where did you go?

125
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,160
I went to SOAS in London.

126
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,120
I don't even know what that is.

127
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,160
It's like a really, really small, really crazy university.

128
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:15,960
So I, you know, I've, I've read all of the, all of this radical stuff as a student and

129
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:21,800
I'm coming from a feminist background and coming from, as I said, the, you know,

130
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,920
the new statesman that I work for is, is, is historically left-wing.

131
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,800
So I'm kind of, I'm trying to speak to those people.

132
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,000
But I mean, the books for conservatives as well, because there are bits in it that I

133
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,960
think every, everyone will, will find, will find challenging.

134
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,760
Is it not the fact that a lot of what you're talking about here is

135
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:50,200
conserving some fairly traditional views around men's and women's roles with each other about

136
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,880
sort of chivalrous conduct and having constraints on the way that men and their

137
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,600
regression and their desire for multiple sexual partners.

138
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,280
Like that, that is a fundamentally conservative value.

139
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:05,320
So it seems to me like the conservatives would have far less to disagree with you.

140
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,400
Not again, there's something for everybody to disagree with, but that the conservatives

141
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,160
would probably have far less than the new wave of liberals.

142
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,040
Probably, yeah.

143
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,840
Although I should say that the, this idea of like constraining male sexuality,

144
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,520
which is, which is, is, is central to my pieces basically.

145
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,560
It is conservative in the sense that it was,

146
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:34,360
it was considered to be like a mainstream idea before sexual revolution in the West.

147
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,040
But if you look across time and place, like that's not necessarily considered like

148
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,520
a trad thing to do.

149
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,600
I mean, like, if you look, for instance, at antiquity,

150
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:49,560
the idea that some high status man would have access to sexual access to his underlings was

151
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,280
like completely accepted.

152
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,000
It's really, I don't know if you've read Tom Holland's book, Dominion.

153
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,480
No, you don't mean Tom Holland's the guy that plays Spiderman, do you?

154
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,040
No, I don't.

155
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,520
A common mistake.

156
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,760
No, no, he's a British academic and historian writer.

157
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,720
And he's got this fantastic book called Dominion, which is about

158
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:15,560
basically about history of Christianity and the ways in which Christianity influences

159
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,280
the modern world, even if we consider ourselves to be

160
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,520
a religious or post-Christian.

161
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,000
And he has a bit in there where he talks about me too.

162
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,960
And it really triggered a lot of my thinking about this actually,

163
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,840
a few years ago, where he points out that in, say, the Roman world,

164
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,400
no one would think that Harvey Weinstein was doing anything wrong.

165
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,720
Like the idea that this guy who's at the top of the tree of his particular hierarchy

166
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:47,320
would be able to have sexual access to anyone kind of subordinate to him was like, yeah,

167
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,280
obviously.

168
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:57,480
And actually, the idea that he should be constrained is, Holland argues, a very Christian idea.

169
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,520
And I'm not Christian.

170
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,520
I'm not coming at this from a religious perspective.

171
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,240
But it's worth pointing that out.

172
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,640
You know, like this is not necessarily a normal thing to think.

173
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,440
The window of trad sort of shifts over time, right?

174
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,600
Like no one's actually going that far back.

175
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,160
So, OK, so the sexual revolution happens.

176
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:23,480
Like, surely women have benefited with no more shame and stigma around enjoying sex

177
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,280
and stuff like that.

178
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,480
Who benefited from the sexual revolution overall?

179
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,520
Yeah, so the shame and stigma thing.

180
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,320
I mean, yes, that is definitely one outcome.

181
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:38,200
I mean, like, I think that one of the things that I'm trying to push in this book,

182
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:43,880
and that is shared with, like, Mary Harrington and Nina Powell that you've had on the show before.

183
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,640
Yeah, we're on the same page about this, like, challenging the idea of progress,

184
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:56,520
particularly from a feminist perspective, this idea that history has a shape

185
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,520
and everything is always getting better and better.

186
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:03,640
And everything post-sexual revolution is necessarily better than what came before.

187
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,920
I just don't think it's true.

188
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,280
I think that's nonsense.

189
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:11,560
Like, we're looking at a massive historical event triggered primarily by technology.

190
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,280
Of course, there are going to be upsides and downsides.

191
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:23,560
Yeah, so I think it is absolutely the case that women now can be much more open about sexuality

192
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,320
and I'm more able to enjoy sex in certain circumstances and stuff.

193
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:27,880
That's true.

194
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:36,600
But I also think that to some extent, like, we're social animals and we're very responsive to norms.

195
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:44,600
And what I think has happened is kind of the norms have just spun on a sixpence.

196
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,440
And now, whereas previously, it would have been the case that young women, for instance,

197
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,960
were like protecting their virginity and their reputation for being chased and so on,

198
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,120
was considered very important socially.

199
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,720
Now, if anything, it's the opposite or not quite the opposite,

200
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,840
but that now the pressure actually is on for women to be up for it.

201
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,800
And to be just as sexually adventurous as the guys.

202
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,800
And, you know, like, it's like a slightly painful.

203
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,320
There's a contradiction within that, which is really hard to navigate for young women.

204
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:23,560
We're on the one hand, like, it's good to be sexually open.

205
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:30,200
It's good to sort of base your reputation on being really sexy,

206
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,800
but also there is actually a penalty if your body count is too high,

207
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,520
which is quite difficult.

208
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,640
And I think a lot of young women don't necessarily realise that as well.

209
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,040
Like, they're actually treading a really difficult tightrope,

210
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,000
which is why I think this idea of like, oh, well, people can do whatever they want now.

211
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,520
Like, you know, we're all free to behave as we want sexually.

212
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:58,920
I just don't think it's true, because every culture has expectations in relation to sex,

213
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,560
has norms in relation to sex.

214
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:07,080
I think that what we've done, though, is that we had some quite deeply embedded norms,

215
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,960
which were thrown out the windows of consequence of sexual revolution.

216
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,320
And now there's like a sort of halting effort to maybe rebuild them.

217
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:21,240
Sometimes they're implicit and it's kind of a wild west out there, basically.

218
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,560
Who's enforcing this, then?

219
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,520
Where's this coming from?

220
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:33,320
Are you suggesting that men are weaponising women to believe that they should have a particular type

221
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:38,200
of sexual proclivity that then plays into men's hands because they get more variety?

222
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,600
I don't think there's a conspiracy.

223
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,760
I don't think that anyone is enforcing it.

224
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:47,000
I think that it's just everyone, like, responding to incentives as individuals.

225
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:53,560
And that knits together to create the culture that we see before us.

226
00:14:53,560 --> 00:15:01,960
So, like, yeah, it is in the interests of men who want to sleep around to encourage

227
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:07,160
women to match them, you know, in that kind of behaviour.

228
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,640
So that's clearly going on at an individual level.

229
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:16,120
But then in terms of, like, women's magazines encouraging their readers to do the same,

230
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,200
I have some, I did a lot of digging through women's magazines for this book.

231
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:26,840
And, like, there is some really grim articles out there.

232
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,680
What were your least favourite headlines?

233
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:36,840
I can't remember exactly the wording of it, but there's a whole genre of articles in women's

234
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,040
media about encouraging women not to catch feelings.

235
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:47,160
Or, I mean, the way that it's phrased is how anyone of any gender can not catch feelings

236
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:51,640
when they're having casual sex and how to have casual sex in, like, a fun, feminist way, etc, etc.

237
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:56,840
But, like, we know that women are much more likely to bond quickly with their sexual partners.

238
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,560
We know that they just much less likely to like casual sex.

239
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,320
Something that's really interesting and really marked difference to many women

240
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:12,200
on average in sexuality is women's sexual disgust threshold is a lot lower.

241
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,520
So women will get the ick much easier than men will.

242
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,120
But if you're going to participate, if you're going to have sex like a man,

243
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,440
you have to overcome all of those instincts, right?

244
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:29,480
And so there's a whole genre of women's mags that will basically, like, instruct their young readers

245
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:35,960
in how to suppress their instincts and have sex that actually they kind of know deep down

246
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,000
they shouldn't be having, which I think is really bleak.

247
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:45,160
And, yeah, and I think that just representing that is feminist in any way.

248
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:52,680
Interestingly, looking at it from a man's perspective, I agree that this is bad for women.

249
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,360
I don't think that it serves their interests.

250
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:59,080
I think that the biological predisposition that women have when it comes to sexual partners

251
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,320
trying to decouple having sex.

252
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,440
First off, having sex and making babies was decoupled.

253
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:09,240
But then having sex and having emotions getting attached was decoupled.

254
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,680
And that second one, the pill for that is, I mean, you know, what is it?

255
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,120
Is it 10 vodkas deep?

256
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,400
Like, does that really help?

257
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,240
You know, you wake up in the morning and you feel.

258
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:24,360
But you use this analogy about the fact that Marilyn Monroe was a sort of very attractive

259
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:30,120
woman that was weaponized, commercialized, utilized by a society that wanted to sexualize

260
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:30,600
women.

261
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:35,640
And this was at the benefit of Hughes, Hugh Hefner, the sort of high status man who

262
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,680
was able to sleep with lots of women and continue to do this.

263
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,680
I agree.

264
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,560
I think that you're right.

265
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,560
It is bad for women, but very few men are Hughes.

266
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:52,840
And what you're seeing in the modern society is this most women are probably dissatisfied

267
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:58,440
with the way that their sexual pursuits are going.

268
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,600
Most men now, the number of men reporting no sex between the ages of 18 and 30 has tripled

269
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,480
to nearly 30 percent in the last 10 years.

270
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,360
So the Matthew principle kicks off here.

271
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,800
So I think on average, it's bad for pretty much everybody.

272
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,920
I think that the sort of amount of sexual satisfaction has lowered for everybody.

273
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:23,160
And you have this huge underclass of sexless men, which is where incel, black pill, make

274
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,600
tau, some parts of the red pill, the manasphere, men's rights.

275
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:33,400
All of these movements are, as far as I can see, they're big copes from men who are now

276
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,760
in a sort of sexual wasteland where they're really, really struggling to find connection.

277
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:43,320
So I think that it's, I understand that from a feminist perspective, it is bad for women

278
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,920
and that there are higher costs that they pay.

279
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:51,960
But being a listless, liminal space man with no desire from any female that you give your

280
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,280
attention to is not a good situation to be in either.

281
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,280
Yeah, I completely agree.

282
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,320
Yeah.

283
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,400
I'd add to that things like rates of erectile dysfunction among young men are like insanely

284
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:06,440
high, which is probably suited for maybe also to do with Easter eggs in the environment.

285
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:06,920
I don't know.

286
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,880
God damn Easter eggs.

287
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,800
So I was eating some edamame beans the other day and everyone at the table who's like big

288
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,560
into health and fitness look disgusted.

289
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,120
Apparently, edamame beans have got tons of estrogen in.

290
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:16,600
Who knew?

291
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,440
You can have a bit of soy, can't you?

292
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,560
That's probably it.

293
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,920
Don't go into the soy argument.

294
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,920
But yeah, a few men are used, right?

295
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,600
So they're the ones that are losing.

296
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,360
Yeah, no, this is completely true.

297
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:33,640
And I think as well that there's this like antagonism between feminists and let's say

298
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:41,400
incels broadly, which does I think very much come down to these innate differences to male

299
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,240
and female sexuality and the fact that we don't really talk about them enough,

300
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:51,640
which means I think that you end up with the sex is really misunderstanding each other.

301
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,200
Right?

302
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:59,880
So like feminists will look at incels and like completely not understand why it would be

303
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,040
so frustrating to be a young man who can't get laid.

304
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:07,800
Like I think a lot of women are like surprising and clueless about male sexuality in all sorts

305
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,440
of ways.

306
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:13,240
Like definitely the dark side of male sexuality, but also just like its intensity.

307
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:19,800
I think most women cannot just can't like directly empathize at all.

308
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:24,040
And similarly incels I think would look at women and be like, but you can walk out into

309
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:28,440
the street and pick up half feels and guys, you know, within five minutes, you must be

310
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,440
living heaven on earth and women like, but I don't want that.

311
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,960
And so you end up with this.

312
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:37,240
Everyone thinks that like the other the other side has it easy, which has a lot to do with

313
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:42,280
of just this like these quite fundamental biological differences, making it hard for

314
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,120
us to empathize with one another.

315
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:50,200
And this is added to a culture in which like not only are those sexuality differences

316
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:55,000
routinely denied, but like the the existence of sexual dimorphism is routinely denied.

317
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:00,040
It's like, how can you possibly like successfully navigate the sexual landscape if you don't

318
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,240
even think many women exist?

319
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,160
That's just great categories.

320
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,040
Do you think that inventing the pill was an error then?

321
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,800
No, because I think.

322
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,360
I mean, socially, no, like that there are.

323
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,720
Mary Harrington will probably talk to you about the environmental consequences of the pill.

324
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,640
And yeah, we've just mentioned each other and that's like that's another story.

325
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,120
Socially, I think no, I mean, I think it is.

326
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:31,480
I'm personally grateful for the fact that my life is not entirely dominated by childbearing,

327
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,880
which it would have been in a previous era.

328
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,320
I'm not going to expect to have 10 children and to spend my whole life either pregnant

329
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,040
or postpartum.

330
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,160
I think it's more that we haven't really negotiated with the social consequences.

331
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,640
And that's what I'm trying.

332
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:51,800
That's the sort of conversation I'm trying to initiate because we, you know, we have,

333
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,760
we have the power to.

334
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:57,960
I'm not like a complete, I have a sort of materialist analysis of all of this.

335
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:03,160
And I think in the end, it does come down to things like the pill,

336
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,760
things like changes in the economy.

337
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:11,240
You know, I think so often you get the popular narrative of feminist history

338
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:19,080
is basically sees it as being driven by particularly inspiring feminists

339
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:24,040
who just kind of give really strong arguments and everyone's persuaded.

340
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,880
And this is what, you know, this is what gives us the vote.

341
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,040
This is what gives us access to professions, whatever.

342
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,840
I don't think that's true.

343
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,960
I mean, clearly there have been some very impressive feminists historically.

344
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:36,040
But I think that the real story of the last century is things like the washing machine.

345
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:39,560
Yeah, you said the washing machine helped deliberate women more than any feminist did.

346
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,440
Yeah, I think Jordan Peterson said the same thing.

347
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,320
He's completely right.

348
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,960
He also mentions tampons.

349
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:50,600
Yeah, there's all sorts of, all sorts of technologies which make it possible for women

350
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,640
to have lives outside of their home or more outside of their home than previously.

351
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,600
And also changes to the economy, which means that, you know, if you're in a

352
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:04,280
in a knowledge economy or a service economy where male physical strength doesn't have anything

353
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:09,800
like the economic importance that it once did, women and men can participate basically as equals.

354
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,320
You know, there are there are like, obviously childbearing makes a difference.

355
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,040
But if you're if you're on the pill, you're delaying childbearing.

356
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:24,360
You're working at a laptop and you're operating in a very kind of gender neutral social sphere.

357
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,240
You might not even you might not even like work out.

358
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,280
You might have no recognition of the fact that men and women are

359
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,360
profoundly physically different in terms of things like strength.

360
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,680
Like from that perspective, it looks as if the whole world is gender neutral.

361
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:48,600
And so that's kind of that's that is the sort of social context in which this idea of the

362
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,680
the difference between men and women being socially constructed or being trivial makes sense.

363
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:01,480
But actually, that's like a very, very superficial analysis of what's going on.

364
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,160
But actually, I mean, one of the physical differences is still profound, but also

365
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,560
like those psychological differences go really deep.

366
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:13,000
Because we're talking about hundreds of thousands of years of evolutionary history

367
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,680
feeding into us having these really distinct reproductive roles and that

368
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:21,640
and that leading to us having quite different modes of sexuality.

369
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:31,000
Didn't you say that the USA women's football team was beaten by the Dallas under 15s football team?

370
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:39,000
Yeah, yeah, there are like several examples of this of elite women's teams being beaten by

371
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,040
teenage boys.

372
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:46,040
I think that the the fastest woman in the 100 meters on the planet gets beaten by

373
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:52,680
about 100 or 200 under 17s in America, 200 under 17 men in America.

374
00:24:52,680 --> 00:25:01,160
I mean, the whole like the discussion around male and female physical strength differences

375
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:07,400
are purely due to the fact that girls get told that they need to play with dolls and guys go

376
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,640
and lift lift little trucks and stuff.

377
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:15,400
It feels like lapping to me, it feels like everybody is living this sort of charade

378
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:19,960
and nobody can bear themselves to to pull out of it like that's wild.

379
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,400
But when it comes to the psychological differences, there's a little bit more,

380
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,240
I guess, plausible room for manoeuvre there because you can't see the manifest as much.

381
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,000
And when you've also got a discussion about people being able to transition from

382
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:38,520
different genders, the male brain and the female brain and traits that you put them on

383
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,720
and take them off like clothes.

384
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:45,320
Yeah, and there are outliers, you know, there are there are like less so physically.

385
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,920
I mean, you do sometimes get really strong women or whatever.

386
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:55,720
But even then, I mean, I do my husband and I are both power lifters and just I don't think

387
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:02,520
that you can spend five minutes in a power lifting gym and not be aware of the fact that

388
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:06,120
men and women strength differences are massive, even if there are obviously some really strong

389
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:06,520
women.

390
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,120
Do you pull conventional or sumo?

391
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:08,840
Conventional.

392
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,960
What about the husband?

393
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,240
Also conventional.

394
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:11,960
Good.

395
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,400
It's a family of non-cheaters.

396
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,240
I'm adamant that sumo is cheating.

397
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,560
Yeah, I mean, and then I see I've been, you know, trading this for years and then I see

398
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:29,560
like novice men warming up with my one red max and then it's just it's just like the

399
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,840
pure reality of it.

400
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,280
But I mean, if people don't participate in those kind of sports, also things like martial

401
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,360
arts, if you don't participate in that, you wouldn't.

402
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,480
necessarily know it.

403
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,280
But on the psychological differences, yeah, there are there are more outliers.

404
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:47,240
There are some people who are really atypical for their sex and there clearly is like a lot

405
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,360
of space for culture to intervene.

406
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:57,080
But it's so on an individual level, if you know what, if you know someone's sex, you

407
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,880
don't necessarily know anything really about their personality.

408
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:04,360
It's more that at the population level, when you're talking about millions of people,

409
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,520
that's when you see it play out.

410
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:12,520
And like something that is really interesting and really makes clear that how profound these

411
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:17,400
differences are is you look at things like university campuses and look at their sex

412
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:22,600
ratio on campuses where there are more women than men.

413
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,520
So men are the rarer sex.

414
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:29,560
There's more hookup culture because the rarer sex is able to set the terms more easily.

415
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:34,280
And then on campuses where there are more women than men, so men are the rarer sex.

416
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,080
There are more men than women, you have the inverses, more monogamy.

417
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:41,480
And that's the sort of thing where, yes, there will be individual outliers,

418
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,640
but you can't deny the differences when you when you see it playing out in those kind of larger

419
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:46,920
arenas.

420
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:53,880
Well, that sex ratio hypothesis is kind of the basis as well for a ton of hypergamy,

421
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,840
that as you have an ever increasing group of high-performing women and an ever decreasing

422
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:03,000
group of underperforming men that are dropping out of college, that aren't getting as educated,

423
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:09,160
women age 21 to 29 earn 1,111 pounds more on average than the equivalent man.

424
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,360
So during the period when women are seeking a mate,

425
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:17,800
they're unable to find what fundamentally on average women want to find a mate that is

426
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,400
more statusful, wealthier and better educated than they are.

427
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:25,960
Those are the cues typically that they were attracted to, but now women are able to gain

428
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,560
status, earn more and become better educated than men at higher rates than men,

429
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:35,960
which is what's causing this sort of upward tilt toward turbo chad at the top sleeping with everybody,

430
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:43,880
listless, sexless men underclass down here, and then the wistful women and alpha widows

431
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,640
that are in this sort of world.

432
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:51,480
I mean, this is the most interesting dynamic that I think there is at the moment when it

433
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,280
comes to dating.

434
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,680
It's got downstream implications economically.

435
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:58,040
It's got downstream implications when you think about population growth,

436
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,680
population decline, culture, crime.

437
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,000
You don't want this huge underclass of sexless men roaming the streets.

438
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,720
When you get into a relationship as a man, your testosterone goes down.

439
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,720
When you have a child, your testosterone goes down again, because it's advantageous,

440
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,720
it's adaptive for you to not be going out doing reckless shit when you've got a baby

441
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,400
and a wife at home to look after.

442
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:22,280
So all of this, I mean, this is just, it is by far the most interesting dynamic,

443
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,880
I think, that's happening in the world at the moment.

444
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,680
Yeah, and this is the subject of it.

445
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:30,920
So my last chapter is called Marriage is Good, and a lot of people who've just seen

446
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:36,680
the contents page sort of assumed that it's a Christian argument or whatever.

447
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:42,760
But actually, it's making exactly, it's like a very rational, secular argument for actually,

448
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:47,800
if you look at what happens to a society when you get rid of monogamous marriage and you

449
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:53,080
compare our society and as it was in the past, and also look at societies where

450
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,320
polygony is the norm.

451
00:29:55,320 --> 00:30:00,440
Like most society, I think it's about 80% of societies on the anthropological record

452
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:04,760
have had polygony as a socially acceptable thing.

453
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:11,800
So you end up with the chads who are having multiple wives, and then you've got men who

454
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,920
never marry at all.

455
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:17,000
And you do also have some monogamy in the middle, like it's normally not quite that extreme.

456
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,560
But that, it seems, is basically our natural state as a species.

457
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,560
And because it just, it just recurs again and again and again.

458
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:32,520
And that minority of cultures that have been monogamous, including Western cultures, are

459
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:37,400
unusual, but and it's not like it does sort of have to be imposed.

460
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:42,120
Like, you know, like a lot of elite men will cheat, for instance.

461
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,600
And, you know, they take on extra wives that they could.

462
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:49,080
People, monogamy is not really our natural state.

463
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:54,040
It does have to be socially enforced, but it also is like amazingly successful.

464
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,640
Anthropologists talk about the puzzle of monogamous marriage in that it is weird to see that

465
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,360
a culture like ours would have developed it in the first place because it clearly doesn't

466
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,640
suit the interests of elite men.

467
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,520
You'd think that the elite men would want would want to have multiple wives, which of

468
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,160
course they do.

469
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,120
But the reason they think that it's become as successful as it has is because monogamous

470
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,160
societies do well.

471
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,520
More stable.

472
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,440
They're more stable.

473
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,680
They're also more productive.

474
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,960
So they colonize other parts of the world, basically, because they're

475
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,160
wealthy and, you know, striving and successful.

476
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,080
And then they impose their marriage norms elsewhere.

477
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,520
Think about it this way.

478
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,720
I've only just thought about this.

479
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,880
The naturalistic fallacy gets used a lot with this, right?

480
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:40,760
Look, ancestrally, we maybe don't have tons of evidence that we're a monogamous species.

481
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,560
Their form of monogamy is not the strategy that we're supposed to go down.

482
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:49,080
If you accept the fact that non-monogamous societies are more unstable and are going to

483
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,520
exist for a lesser amount of time, that means that the living standards are going to be

484
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:52,760
lower.

485
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,800
That means that mortality or all of the things that you care about, right,

486
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,920
are going to be out of the window.

487
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:04,280
What if monogamy for the individual sometimes can be suboptimal,

488
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,240
but on average is optimal for the culture as a whole?

489
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:11,240
In the same way as when seatbelts got introduced, people didn't want to wear them.

490
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,800
And a lot of the time it's not just you that you're saving.

491
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,680
It's also other people in the car because if you don't have your seatbelt on,

492
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,000
you bounce around and you smash up everybody else as well.

493
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:27,080
Maybe a different way to frame monogamy is that it's kind of like following the law

494
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:27,720
a little bit.

495
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:34,040
It's a small individual sacrifice that you make that does perhaps make for some people

496
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,680
suboptimal living standards, but only a little bit.

497
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:43,640
But the reason that you do that is to contribute to the entire stability of society.

498
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,560
Yeah, I've heard, I can't remember who came up with this,

499
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:52,760
but I've heard monogamy referred to as sexual socialism, basically that reason.

500
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,520
It's a redistribution strategy for sure.

501
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:58,520
Yeah, yeah, I mean, I mean, we mentioned Jordan Rees again.

502
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,840
He got in trouble for saying something along these lines.

503
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,480
I can't remember exactly what it was.

504
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,520
Enforced monogamy.

505
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,680
I brought it up with them at the start of the year.

506
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:10,280
Yeah, because it sounds really authoritarian, but I think what he was describing there is

507
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,680
basically a weird describing where it's like socially prescribed.

508
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,160
It's not even necessarily legally required.

509
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,240
It's just considered to be the norm.

510
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,520
Cheating is considered to be bad.

511
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,120
You can't have a second wife.

512
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:26,600
And yeah, I mean, there are other good outcomes also in terms of things like child abuse and

513
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:30,360
domestic violence, which obviously something feminists are very interested in.

514
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:36,440
Like polygynous societies have much higher rates of both because the household with

515
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:41,240
multiple wives and their children are like full of conflict.

516
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:46,600
A hundred times more likely that a child is going to be killed if they're in the household

517
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,240
with one parent that isn't their biological parent.

518
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:49,560
Yeah.

519
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,160
A hundred times more likely.

520
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,640
Yeah, yeah, it's insane.

521
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:54,840
It's wild.

522
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,800
Okay, so what's sexual disenchantment?

523
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:09,240
So social disenchantment is basically, I took it from Max Weber, the sociologist who wrote about

524
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,960
disenchantment of the natural world as part of the Enlightenment.

525
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:19,800
So when people used to believe pre-enlightenment that the natural world was kind of possessed

526
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:25,640
by spirits and had like agency and specialness like infused within it.

527
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:29,960
And then we become more rational, whatever, opposed to enlightenment and realised actually

528
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,680
it's all just like scientific forces of play.

529
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,960
I think that it's not my turn.

530
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,080
I borrowed it from Aaron Sabar, an American writer.

531
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:45,080
Sexual disenchantment is what happens post-sexual revolution where you used to think of sex as

532
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,440
having this kind of specialness.

533
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:53,400
I mean within Christianity of being like a sacrament within marriage and then now it's

534
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:59,800
stripped of all of that meaning and it just becomes basically any old social interaction.

535
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,800
Like it's just a means of having fun.

536
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,400
Basically, it doesn't necessarily mean anything.

537
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,160
I mean, the point that I'm making the book is actually basically no one really believes

538
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,440
in sexual disenchantment.

539
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:13,240
People talk about it a lot and particularly like progressives and liberal feminists will

540
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:16,920
talk about it as if it's an ideal.

541
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:21,320
Like we should of course get rid of all these like stupid old fashioned ideas about sex,

542
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,440
having some like innate specialness.

543
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:31,080
But actually people don't really behave as if that's true because people behave almost always

544
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:36,200
as if actually sex does have a special status and it's a special status you can't necessarily

545
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,320
define very easily but people feel it.

546
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:46,040
Like people care if they get cheated on even in the polyamorous community.

547
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:52,120
Like if you go into any polyamorous subreddit or whatever, you will find people really struggling

548
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:56,760
with jealousy as this like intense instinctive thing that they're trying to override and they

549
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,480
can't quite do it.

550
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,320
People, I mean it's sexual harassment in the workplace.

551
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:09,320
I get really frustrated with feminists who claim simultaneously that sex workers work

552
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:16,200
and that we should like get rid of all these hang-ups about selling sex being any different

553
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,960
from working at McDonald's or selling any other kind of service.

554
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:26,040
But then they also get so sensitive about any perceived section of propriety in their workplace.

555
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,000
What like?

556
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,600
Like being touched by a boss for instance.

557
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:36,040
Like not even in a like a really aggressive assaulting way but just you know women getting

558
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:40,280
touched on the arm or something like that or being asked out in a context that you don't really

559
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,000
feel comfortable.

560
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,560
You know all that kind of me too stuff which is quite low level.

561
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:50,360
Like if that if it's really the case that sex workers work then what is the problem with being

562
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,120
asked by your boss to give them a blow job?

563
00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:00,120
Right it's work, it's just a service, it's like being asked to do it over time or make a coffee.

564
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:04,840
Or make a coffee yeah and no one actually thinks that that it's just like making a coffee.

565
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:09,080
So I think that the sexual disenchantment idea is really just theoretical.

566
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:15,720
It's a rhetorical kind of move but actually doesn't really describe reality and doesn't

567
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,480
really describe how people feel.

568
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:24,040
I mean it's kind of just an inconvenient fact that if you're trying to be super rational

569
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:30,120
and you're trying to resist anything like remotely traditional or religious or you know

570
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:39,080
anything old fashioned then the fact that people feel very differently about sex and

571
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,960
they do about other things is kind of inconvenient.

572
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,560
It's felt like an aberration right?

573
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:49,720
It's like oh this is just an analogy drawn with the non monogamy community is so correct.

574
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:53,000
One of my friends out here in Austin was telling me about the first time that his

575
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:58,840
wife brought somebody else back and he was on the floor of the bathroom dry retching.

576
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:06,040
But at the time he's now married at the time was adamant that this was just him working

577
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:11,080
through his ego and this is in part of the process this is part of the processing thing.

578
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:16,280
I'm like dude that's you're not choosing to throw up that's something way way way

579
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:21,800
behind conscious programming that's innate that's built in but is it you that is this

580
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,080
your quote that says few liberal feminists are willing to draw the link between the

581
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:29,240
culture of sexual hedonism they promote and the anxieties of a campus rate that have

582
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,000
emerged at the exact same time?

583
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:40,040
Yeah yeah that's yeah yeah because I think what's going I think what's going on a lot

584
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:47,640
with me too is that what what meets what was described during me too and still is I guess

585
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:53,960
I mean it's still it's still going on in different forms right was not always right right like some

586
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:58,360
so with like going back to Weinstein for instance some of what he did was like straightforwardly

587
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:04,200
illegal and he was convicted of it therefore but a lot of what is described is much more

588
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:10,760
somewhere in the middle you know much more open to interpretation and often what women were talking

589
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:17,000
about was just like feeling creeped out or feeling like like exactly this dry retching on the bathroom

590
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,840
floor feeling like your instincts are telling you something even if you can't quite rationalize it

591
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:30,200
and often this was like expressed in terms of consent because in the liberal feminist

592
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:35,560
framework the only thing you're really allowed to talk about is consent because you because

593
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,480
all the old-fashioned norms are out the window you're not allowed to talk about chivalry you're

594
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:46,840
not allowed to talk about um like any kind of instinctive feeling of disgust or discomfort

595
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:51,720
that you have kind of has to be suppressed but you are allowed to talk about consent and so

596
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:56,120
everything had to be expressed in the form in like the language of consent so I talk about for

597
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:01,720
instance the Aziz Ansari case you might remember I can't remember the name of the grace I think was

598
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:08,360
her her pseudonym this woman who went on a date with the actor Aziz Ansari went back to his house

599
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:13,800
afterwards and he kind of he didn't rape her and he didn't do anything illegal but he just kind of

600
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:19,560
subtly pressured her into doing sex things that she didn't really want to do and then later she

601
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:26,120
wrote a sort of first-hand account of this um and he got in trouble but it was one of those

602
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,520
it was it was a bit later on in me too and it was one of those ones that provoked a lot of

603
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:34,120
discussion because it was because it was a borderline one like he hadn't had he done anything

604
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:40,200
wrong he definitely hadn't done anything illegal um the idea that he hadn't that he had violated her

605
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:45,880
consent just didn't really stack up just based on her own story I think what's often going on here

606
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:51,320
is it's to do with this pressure that women feel to have sex like men

607
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:58,440
and to try and have emotionless sex and to try and just like you know to do the sexual

608
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:04,200
disengagement thing and just treat it like a like a leisure activity but they can't actually quite

609
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:10,200
do it and they feel like they feel sexual disgust they feel shame they feel like these deep painful

610
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:17,160
emotions and the only person sometimes to blame is the man even though he actually might not have

611
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:21,320
done anything wrong really or he I mean he probably wasn't behaving like a gentleman

612
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:26,120
but he wasn't doing anything illegal and he wasn't doing anything really wrong according to like

613
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:31,800
the the standards of the day it's just that the standards of the day are not actually very good for

614
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:37,640
women that's it you've nailed it you've absolutely nailed it there and you're right the the outlet

615
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:44,360
for pushback and and for distaste the only one that is there is the man and the only

616
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:49,320
framing through which you can talk about this is consent which is where false allegations I think

617
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:57,800
sometimes come in that perhaps you repurpose ick as guilt as it must have done something criminal

618
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:04,520
yeah now it's rape yeah and of course the nature of it is that there are only two people there

619
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:09,480
there weren't any witnesses and so it's everyone's like analysis of something that's gone in the past

620
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:14,760
is just really difficult and you know to be fair to a lot of men they're being

621
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:21,640
they're being raised in the same culture where you're told that this is that women love it you

622
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:26,920
know they I mean they haven't necessarily watched like Sex and the City but it's the same it's the

623
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:33,640
same milieu where you wear like having sex like a man is aspirational and the idea is I write a

624
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:39,720
lot in the book about pop culture examples of women who are clearly aspirational fictional characters

625
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:45,240
who have loads of casual sex love it like don't have any emotional connection to the men

626
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:50,520
that they use for sex and this is this is like this is this is aspirational you know and so and

627
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:54,520
and young men are seeing this as well and they're also watching porn which gives a completely

628
00:42:54,520 --> 00:43:01,640
unrealistic realistic perspective on what women like and so you know they're clueless basically

629
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:05,720
they're playing by the rules of the game as well or at least by the cultural influences of the game

630
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:12,520
that they think are going on another another problem that you have here in the asymmetric warfare of

631
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:18,440
the sexes is that men who begin to get a little bit of resentment for women let's say that they've

632
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:23,320
had the heart broken in the past but that they are within the standard where they can keep having

633
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:26,680
sex right they're not one of the underclass they're actually someone that can keep on doing it

634
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,960
if they become aware of the fact that girls are trying to play this game of detached

635
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:37,080
emotionless sex if they fully become conscious of that they go oh okay let's see who can win at

636
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:41,960
this game the most because it's not going to be you it's going to be me and they can you know this

637
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:45,560
isn't to say again on average this isn't to say that some men don't get attached after the first

638
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:51,640
time they have sex so they go some of my friends fall pretty hard but they if they can weaponize

639
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:58,200
that they can do a ton of damage as well and yeah i i don't know there's maybe an argument

640
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:03,160
that everybody just needs to not be able to have sex until the age of 25 and then when they do

641
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:08,200
they're like look i'm fully emotionally balanced i've been through a bunch of breakups i didn't

642
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:12,920
have sex during the during the relationship i kind of know what i like and what i don't like

643
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:17,880
i don't know i it's just so many describing there is marriage chris

644
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,880
that used to be what it was you weren't allowed to have sex before you got married

645
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:29,960
which gave which gave like men in particular a massive incentive to get their shit together

646
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:37,800
because if you can't if you can't get married until you've say like achieved certain adult

647
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:44,760
things like you've got a job you've got a house you know or like you've got whatever the system is

648
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:50,280
like a certain amount of money that you can demonstrate your sort of eligibility as a husband

649
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:55,240
if you have to get all of your ducks in a row before you can have sex i mean you can potentially

650
00:44:55,240 --> 00:45:01,960
buy sex but you can't have it like socially illicit then that that's a huge incentive

651
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:09,480
to behave yourself and to do pro-social stuff whereas if you have a scenario now where either

652
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:17,000
either you're like attractive enough that you can get sex casual sex without having to

653
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:22,920
to do anything really except be like moderately charming or you can get sex

654
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:27,560
through all you all you have access to porn which like gives you the

655
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:34,200
of gives some of the same like feedback from your environment as if you were actually having sex

656
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:38,920
like i mean this would get so this will get so much worse with sex robots

657
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:44,600
where all of a sudden you can like basically bypass all of the effort that you might historically

658
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:49,400
have had to put in in order to access sex you can just buy a sex robot and you can spend your whole

659
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:56,840
life playing video games never going to gym never showering never having a job and you still

660
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:01,080
get access to this thing that your ancestors like fought teeth and nails to get access to

661
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:07,640
even without the sex robots men are retreating i think from from the dating market terrifying

662
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:14,040
terrifying rates there's a quote that rob henderson came up with which is this a similar

663
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:18,920
sort of dynamic that we're talking about here says norms were loosened around being an absentee

664
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:23,400
father so more men took the option but nobody wants to admit it because it upsets people

665
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:27,720
instead we retreat to discussions of poverty and economics because talking about family and

666
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:34,120
parenting makes people feel weird and judgmental but young men will only do what's expected of them

667
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:39,800
and a lot did use to be expected there were social norms to work hard provide take care of loved ones

668
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:46,120
and so on today these norms have largely dissolved young men have responded accordingly yeah he's

669
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:52,760
very very smart rob henderson he's completely right um yeah i mean i think that i think that the

670
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:57,160
the line i have in the book about debbie dad's is that when

671
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:03,720
when motherhood became a biological choice for women fatherhood became a social choice for men

672
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:10,840
what do you mean by that in the when contraception and legalized abortion became available

673
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:17,880
i mean that basically killed the shotgun marriage pretty much immediately because it no longer

674
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:26,520
served the same social purpose that it had before um but the nature of contraception is such that

675
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:32,120
nothing is 100% foolproof and actually the pill particularly in its earliest incarnations wasn't

676
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:37,320
that great and still isn't that great because it depends a lot on the user using it properly so if

677
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:43,400
you're using it properly it's like 99 plus effective but in reality it's more like 91 so you

678
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:47,160
end up with a lot of unplanned pregnancies and there will always be someone who don't want to

679
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:53,400
have a termination for whatever reason um but if you're in a social context where like

680
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:58,920
there isn't necessarily considered to be a link between sex and reproduction

681
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:05,400
and getting pregnant is considered to be like this unwelcome aberration rather than literally the

682
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:12,120
whole point then it becomes much more socially acceptable for men to not stick around because

683
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:19,480
they say well you chose this you know you're on your own which is yeah i mean obviously there have

684
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:24,440
always been cases of people i've had some critics pointing this out you know they've always been

685
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:29,640
cases of men abandoning their wives or abandoning women that they think that they made pregnant

686
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:33,320
outside of marriage you know they've always been scandals they've always been unwanted

687
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:40,440
pregnancies whatever like that's absolutely true but rates of out of wedlock births now are

688
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:45,240
completely historically unprecedented which is kind of weird because you would think that

689
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:50,440
giving women the technology that enables them to control their fertility would reduce single

690
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:55,240
motherhood but it's done the opposite because humans are humans are complicated creatures

691
00:48:55,240 --> 00:49:01,000
that's what i learned from mary harrington that you introduce the pill single single motherhood

692
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:07,000
goes up like who the fuck could have predicted that right you know that's four degrees of detachment

693
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:18,520
away you know it's so interesting but also kind of tragic but it's it seems like women it was it

694
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:23,720
was a perfect storm right you had the the decoupling socially then you had the decoupling

695
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:30,200
biologically but you haven't had the decoupling emotionally it's still that

696
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:34,920
fundamentally there will be some women that are able to have sex like a man

697
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:38,200
and there will be some able there's a man the men that are able to have sex like a man

698
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:42,520
but on average it used to be something that you work toward for a long time it used to be the

699
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:47,720
sort of thing and think about now i was uh sent another article by rob the other day where he

700
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:57,400
was talking about why is it that parents tend to select when when their daughter or son brings

701
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:04,680
home a new potential partner they look at things like job title earnings family and he asked why

702
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:08,840
is that the case why is it that you look at these when you know they're not looking at how hot they

703
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:14,440
are not looking at a detraction and stuff like that even kindness kind of takes a little bit of a

704
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:20,520
back seat and it's less falsifiable basically the fact is look these are the things that are

705
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:29,720
going to be the most likely to become grandchild optimizing algorithms do you have status do you

706
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:34,840
have money do you have the right family behind you if you've got those i'm probably gonna have

707
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:41,320
grandchildren all of the other ones are wishy washy and and kind of easy to to fake in a way

708
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:47,400
um why why is it then that loveless sex isn't empowering

709
00:50:51,960 --> 00:51:00,680
yeah i mean because because your animal brain which none of us are completely in control of

710
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:07,240
for women in particular even if there are some allies as you mentioned i mean often the outliers

711
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:11,720
like often women who who don't get attached to sex for instance have like a history of sexual

712
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:16,200
trauma there's often not a very healthy reason behind it but you know like accepting the fact

713
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:22,200
that there are outliers your animal brain thinks that this guy is going to knock you up and like

714
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:30,600
you are going to become a profoundly vulnerable mother baby dyad you know like human infants are

715
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:38,040
insanely vulnerable they need so much more care than any other as far as i know any other species

716
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:45,800
young um and mothers are also extremely vulnerable in the later stages of pregnancy and in and during

717
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:51,400
infancy you have to put so much energy and sacrifice so much in order to raise this child

718
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:58,920
to adulthood and that before like five minutes ago in our evolutionary history was what happened

719
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:05,480
or was certainly what you risked happening if you had sex had heterosexual sex and so

720
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:14,280
like our brains are still primed for that and that's the whole that's the whole purpose behind

721
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:20,360
emotional attachment to a sexual partner and also the whole purpose behind like choosing

722
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:25,640
your sexual partner and the fact that women do tend to be a lot choosier than men there's these

723
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:32,680
quite funny studies that have been done several times where they um they get like quite attractive

724
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:37,400
strangers to go up to men and women i think on university campuses normally in proposition them

725
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:44,040
and when the women proposition male strangers they almost always say yes or and if they say no it's

726
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:48,360
because they have a girlfriend or whatever whereas when the men proposition the women they always say

727
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:57,400
no because women like their filter is impregnable um and there's a reason for that it's because you

728
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:03,640
don't want some some like to be knocked up by some bozo it's just one of the reasons why prostitution

729
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:08,920
is as traumatic as it is i mean there are all there are all of the physical risk and bulging

730
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:15,560
prostitution like rates of murder are insanely high you know it's it's it's it's if we were to

731
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:20,040
compare it to another profession it would be by far the most dangerous profession ever like rates of

732
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:25,720
PTSD and much higher than in the military for instance but one of the reasons why it's so profoundly

733
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:30,040
distressing is that women have this really really strong instinct to like vet their sexual partners

734
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:35,240
and to only have sex with men who seem like good prospects and women also have a very heart a very

735
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:41,880
low sexual disgust threshold which means that they get the ick very readily with a man that they don't

736
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:45,880
fancy and what what women and prostitution are basically required to do is to override that

737
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:51,480
and to suppress those instincts if you talk to women who've who've experienced it they often

738
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:57,400
talk about like working really hard to dissociate from their physical feelings it is that is that

739
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:01,720
retching on the bathroom floor thing i mean actually retching maran whose prostitution

740
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:06,040
survivor and has written this amazing book called paid for it's a memoir of her experiences

741
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:11,160
she talks about that the fact that not vomiting is one of the most important skills a prostitute

742
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:17,560
can have because your your your physical urge to run away and to cry into vomit is that strong

743
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:25,800
that you have to like fight it down and i think that if you know in a much less extreme circumstances

744
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:35,320
obviously but when women are trying to like to to to play the masculine role and imitate male

745
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:40,280
sexuality and to enjoy sex in the way that they think they're supposed to they are basically

746
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:44,680
obliged to suppress their instincts which isn't isn't at all psychologically healthy

747
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:51,560
has normalising sex work like only funds been a benefit for women i mean they clearly are some

748
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:56,520
women are only fans who make a lot of money from it so there are some winners i mean

749
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:05,000
they they are very unusual most women on only fans probably make a loss in terms of the amount

750
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:09,480
of time they have to spend because the perito distribution on only fans is wild and most of

751
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:14,520
the women who do really well on it are already celebrities and already quite wealthy so this

752
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:20,280
idea that you can just be like as long as you're sufficiently pretty you log on and you're making

753
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:25,960
a fortune is not true and i'm sure has been deliberately whipped up that idea by only fans

754
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:31,400
because they're the only people actually really profiting at the end of the day um i mean i think

755
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:36,200
the only fans is not like street prostitution or brothel prostitution like it's clearly not the same

756
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:44,040
i like it's pretty gross and the and you will have men asking you to do things that really turn

757
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:51,640
your stomach but it's clearly not like physically dangerous i think that the main risk of only fans

758
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:58,280
is your ability to have a long-term relationship afterwards because you end up putting your images

759
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:02,360
out in the world and you can't get them back that's an issue of the internet and often only

760
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:07,480
fans creators get their images stolen and so they'll be shared and they don't even get any money from it

761
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:16,440
and the risk is in the future that even though men don't always admit it

762
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:22,760
the sexual double standard is still actually really alive and well if you so sexual double

763
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:29,320
standard being when men are kind of permitted to be a bit promiscuous and that's okay socially

764
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:34,760
but women tend to be punished for promiscuity i think that only fans goes beyond promiscuity

765
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:40,680
you know the double standard didn't account it's not men wanking on camera and then trying to find

766
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:44,920
a wife and them saying uh my friends shared something in a whatsapp chat earlier on and that

767
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:55,800
kind of looks a little bit like you what about um normalizing uh like love sex workers like sex

768
00:56:55,800 --> 00:57:02,360
workers uh you should be completely fine with your partner doing only fans or perhaps even escorting

769
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:10,840
i mean crazy what kind of yeah i mean either i think if i think if a man is really comfortable

770
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:17,320
with that that's like a red flag to me honestly like again it's an example of men suppressing

771
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:23,880
their instincts because the the instinct towards jealousy is so strong and again has such an

772
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:32,360
obvious evolutionary origin to it um because if you're putting loads of resources into raising

773
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:35,720
children that you've had with this woman you want to know they're yours like that's

774
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:42,120
make guarding is what the um biologists call it and it's it's so common that i think it's

775
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:48,600
considered to be a human universal and yeah like there are there are loads of sort of unwelcome

776
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:54,440
phenomena that come from that you know jealousy is often um the motive behind domestic violence

777
00:57:54,440 --> 00:58:00,280
for instance because i you know you mentioned the naturalistic fallacy like the fact that it's

778
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:05,400
natural doesn't mean it's necessarily good but it does also mean that trying to completely override

779
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:09,880
it is probably not gonna work like you have to find a way of accommodating your instincts you

780
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:16,360
can't just try and suppress them and try and like like rewrite the human blueprint well that's where

781
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:22,920
that's where i think the um it's not men that are encouraging women to do only fans

782
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:30,280
i don't see men on the internet saying that you should go and the you girl should ditch your

783
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:35,240
job and go and do it the only people online saying sex work is real work seems to be women

784
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:40,280
yes men are the ones that are paying for their images once they're in the game but i think

785
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:46,200
that's because once women cross that threshold and become a sex worker or whatever they're almost

786
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:51,720
kind of not subhuman but they're in a different category right and it's like oh well they're

787
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:55,240
doing it i didn't get them into it so i'm just going to continue to fund them but if you were to

788
00:58:55,240 --> 00:59:01,400
say to most men i think would you advise that pretty girl to get into only fans so that you

789
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:08,280
can see her nudes most of them would say probably not probably not but almost every healthy man would

790
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:12,920
say no right they'd say no i'll try and go out with her or maybe she should just go and enjoy her

791
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:17,480
life or do whatever but once they're in the game that's what's going to happen but you have this

792
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:24,920
this very bizarre sort of cartel i don't know it's like uh self not self oppression but like

793
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:31,320
self capitalization from women of women encouraging other women to go and do the game

794
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,960
despite the fact that the chances of you making money on only fans is

795
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:39,640
minuscule low when it comes to actually making the tens of thousands of dollars a day that the

796
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:47,400
biggest creators make and yeah i mean even even if you were able to have an unbelievably secure

797
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:53,640
only fans that was never able to leak your photos online you have two choices for the remainder of

798
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:57,960
your life when you get into talking to a new partner you can either tell them the truth and

799
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:03,240
regardless of how comfortable that guy is with his sexuality finding out that his miss is

800
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:09,080
forget body count even if you've only slept with one other person but that was something that you

801
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:17,400
did you can't like left brain your way out of thinking that that is oh god well if she did that

802
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:22,120
in the past does this mean that she's maybe going to she's a risk for promiscuity in the future like

803
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:27,640
the cook radar is so hyper attuned for men which is why we get more jealous or the other one is to

804
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:35,800
lie to him cook radar is interesting praise good coinage game because i have you because i have

805
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:42,920
used the i've i've i've don't write it in the book but i um like talked about on twitter non-trader

806
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:50,680
i think that women have really strongly i mean i think men do as well but i think women in

807
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:54,840
particular have a really strong like it's i think it's hardly a sexual disgusting is that feeling

808
01:00:54,840 --> 01:01:00,280
of like this guy is creepy and i think that it i think it's like female intuition right and i

809
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:03,640
think it's coming it's probably partly coming from wanting to protect yourself is also partly

810
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:08,600
wanting to protect your children you've got that like this guy's bad news yeah if i'm gonna sleep

811
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:15,080
with him what's he gonna do to the kids perhaps i saw i got to tell you about this uh meme that i

812
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:21,240
saw so carl benjamin sargon of a cad a guy who uh has incredibly conservative views about this stuff

813
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:25,320
but aligns completely with what we're saying here he posted a meme the other day and it had a girl

814
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:29,320
from only fans in like a bikini or laundry or whatever sort of dancing away on one side and

815
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:34,040
had michael scott from the office on the other sort of looking strangely and the text said

816
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:39,480
we call it female empowerment and they will dance naked for the price of a cheeseburger

817
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:46,760
yeah yeah i mean this question you raise about why women encouraging each other to do it you're

818
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:50,600
right i mean one exception i would give this idea of a friend who went on a date with a guy who said

819
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:55,800
you're so hot you should be on only fans and she did not go on a date with him again because it was

820
01:01:55,800 --> 01:02:02,600
just so obviously i know failing strategy i think yeah because the way that she interpreted it and

821
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:07,960
i think correctly was that he was he was clearly not regarding her as like wife material right

822
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:11,880
and this is this is i think an error that women do make sometimes where they don't have a good

823
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:17,400
understanding of male sexuality and they don't it's really interesting i don't know if you read

824
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:22,680
david busser's book bad men i absolutely love it yeah i brought him on for this fantastic book yeah

825
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:27,480
and he talks about the fact that women tend to assess like short-term partners and long-term

826
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:33,240
partners based on the same uh qualities they want the same things in all the men they have

827
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:38,600
sex with men don't do that they have a much lower standard for their short-term partners and they do

828
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:42,360
for long-term partners and so they will be willing to have sex with a woman that they absolutely

829
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:47,080
would not marry they would not even introduce to their friends and i think a lot of women don't

830
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:54,440
necessarily know that and so they will interpret sexual advances from men as flattering when

831
01:02:54,440 --> 01:03:01,160
actually they can are potentially like cheap you know this is the genesis of the alpha widow

832
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:06,840
right like this is what many girls that are liberated sexually and using tinder and stuff

833
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:12,680
like that don't get and i think that this is another i'm i'm actually not so convinced about

834
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:18,040
quite how big of an effect this is i'd need to see rob go and do some research about it

835
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:22,520
but certainly women are able to sleep with men that they wouldn't be able to get into a relationship

836
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:28,440
with but the reverse isn't true and there is an argument that the the aftershock of this means that

837
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:34,200
those women are going to constantly pine after the nine out of ten guy that's worth half a million

838
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:42,040
and all that i'm not sure about how long that would last for and the echoes of that and stuff

839
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:47,960
like that but i certainly think that um what porn has done to men which is to teach them that women

840
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:53,560
are to be objectified is similar in part to what only fans has done to women which is to teach

841
01:03:53,560 --> 01:04:00,120
some women that men are commercial vehicles to be exploited and that their sex is just a

842
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:08,120
it's a commodity you can trade it like anything else yeah and it's not i think as well some women

843
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:16,280
who are already like posting a lot of raunchy photos on instagram don't necessarily feel like

844
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:21,480
only fans is that biggest step it's just a bit more explicit and you get paid for it so you can

845
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:29,560
sort of see the reasoning and what some women say and i i get it is that you know yes maybe that it

846
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:32,760
means that some men in the future wouldn't want to be in a relationship with me because i've got

847
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:36,600
these photos out in the world but i wouldn't want to be in a relationship with a man like that anyway

848
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:39,960
if he's going to judge me sort of thing and the problem with that is that if you actually look

849
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:45,560
at research on men it's like that's basically all men they might not say it because it's not

850
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:50,440
really socially acceptable to admit to but actually it is basically all men like to the point that

851
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:57,800
if a man isn't bothered i'd wonder if he had a cuckold fetish you know and then and then that

852
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:01,800
like obviously brings complications to your relationship what did you learn about porn

853
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:11,480
when you looked at that for the book i mean the thing with porn that i think a lot of people don't

854
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:19,400
fully appreciate is that online porn is a completely different beast from like playboy

855
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:23,880
of the 60s i mean i start the book by writing about playboy writing like you have no and clearly

856
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:30,360
like there were feminist writing at the time about porn being really grim for women there's

857
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:35,880
this famous cover of an issue of hustler i can't remember what year it was published in probably

858
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:42,600
the 70s where a woman is being like um ground up in a meat grinder and her legs are just

859
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:48,040
sticking out the top it's really like of like deliberately grotesque image and feminist got

860
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:54,440
so upset about it at the time i think rightly but like they had no idea what would happen

861
01:05:54,440 --> 01:06:03,240
with the internet and i think that the thing that's so sinister about online porn is that

862
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:11,240
there's this there's this quote i use in the book that the nature of like

863
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:17,400
technical capitalism is that we are all either above the algorithm or below the algorithm we're

864
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:24,200
writing these we're either creating these these these pieces of tech or we're being influenced

865
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:28,760
by them because we're using them or we're you know sexually interacting with people who are

866
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:34,280
using them and porn is such an amazing example of this because it's just profit driven that's the

867
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:39,080
point of it it's not it's not interested in the well-being of its consumers i mean whatever

868
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:46,040
like porn have have various like advertising efforts to try and sanitize what they do but

869
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:53,640
the whole the whole point of it is making money and they're really good at it and the way that

870
01:06:53,640 --> 01:07:02,440
they do it is by basically creating a super stimulus which adults uses brains and the like

871
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:09,160
they're incredibly adept at basically arousing the human body the human animal like we can't

872
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:14,600
really resist our animal instincts as quickly as possible so you log on to one of these platforms

873
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:19,960
and you look at the front page and like everything is designed to make you as horny as possible as

874
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:30,120
quickly as possible and the the way the platforms are designed is to like introduce you to the

875
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:33,960
super stimulus and then introduce it to something even more stimulating and even more stimulating

876
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:39,000
even more stimulating and so you end up and i mean so a lot of people are able to use porn

877
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,240
casually quite a lot of people don't use it at all like a surprising including men surprising

878
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:48,040
proportion do you know how much that is so i read a survey that about a quarter of millennial men

879
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:57,640
haven't used it in the last month which quite a lot but the the there's a minority of users

880
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:04,200
who are like helpless power users yeah yeah like again it's a burrito is a play as well like there

881
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:09,720
is a small number of men who watch i can't remember the cut the the figure i quote in the book it's

882
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:14,600
something like two percent of users use it for like seven hours a week or more it's a lot of porn

883
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:21,560
do you know um mary harrington's law of fap entropy yes whatever you start out wanking to

884
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:25,400
will get progressively more disgusting over time and you'll be down in the depths of blueberry

885
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:32,920
porn before you know it well yeah absolutely yeah i mean like just anecdotally there are some

886
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:39,880
very strange things that compulsory porn users end up being turned on by and like to the point

887
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:45,160
where they they can't even let erectile dysfunction being a huge problem they can't actually have

888
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:50,360
sex with a real person what's the name for that it's not ground pounding what's it called it's

889
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:55,640
it's called something oh death grip syndrome death ground pounding where the fuck did i pull

890
01:08:55,640 --> 01:09:02,920
that from yeah death more unpleasant i mean death grip syndrome isn't that nice either yeah and i

891
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:08,440
write in the book about um cultural death grip syndrome which is where we've got an incredibly

892
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:16,200
pornified public life you've got so much more like sex scenes on tv advertising billboards whatever

893
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:22,120
i mean like sex scenes on tv have wrapped up so quickly just in my lifetime that used to be edgy

894
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:28,840
and now it's like you know every drama has to have like super super explicit sex scenes every five

895
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:33,240
minutes whatever so you've got that on the one hand well i don't think we've ever had this much

896
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:38,120
explicit sex in public life but then also people aren't actually having sex you have the sex recession

897
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:43,480
with sex depression where you've got as you were saying you've got loads of men who are virgins

898
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:49,800
up into their 20s and so on it's this really weird um what's the word

899
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:56,280
this is this really weird contradiction and it's one that the feminists of the 70s who were so upset

900
01:09:56,280 --> 01:10:02,200
about porn didn't foresee interestingly like they were concerned that porn would inspire sexual

901
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:08,600
violence and like it's complicated because it probably does a bit like in some circumstances so

902
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:16,440
for instance choking porn has become so popular and is so mainstream in a way that it wasn't at

903
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:21,320
all 20 years ago it used to be considered a really niche media sim thing and even actually in the

904
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:28,600
BSN community was considered a bit risky whereas now like survey data is crazy for millennials and

905
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:33,720
younger the proportion of young women who report being choked by their partners um sometimes asking

906
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:39,160
for it and sometimes sometimes non-consensually but it's like just become insanely mainstream

907
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:45,880
really quickly and the only mechanism that i can see for that is porn that it's it's inspiring a

908
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:57,080
change in sexual culture so so sometimes yeah it's inspiring more aggressive behavior from its users

909
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:04,920
but equally actually sometimes it's like basically nuturing users that they become

910
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:09,080
actually incapable of having sex with real person and even becoming capable of being

911
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:14,360
aroused by just normal porn because they're so they'd like they go they go down the rabbit hole

912
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:21,880
Laura Pappentrum continues to yeah what do what do most modern feminists think about porn

913
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:26,760
now then do they think that it's liberating women and allowing them to earn and sex work

914
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:30,520
is real work it's complicated because i think that the

915
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:36,840
like most liberal feminists and sex positive feminists would definitely think that there's

916
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:42,760
nothing like inherently bad about porn and would absolutely defend the right of women to

917
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:46,360
produce it and so on but i think that there's increasingly a view that actually it's not

918
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:54,840
it's not great i did a um debate at the oxford union earlier this year and the the proposition

919
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:59,080
was something like this house welcomes a new porn it was mostly about the new fans but ended

920
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:02,440
up being about porn in general and i thought i'd be slaughtered because i thought that the

921
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:06,840
you know the students were going to be so sex positive and so anti everything i had to say

922
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:11,160
and actually i won surprisingly i had some quite aggressive questions from the floor

923
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:17,720
but actually at the end um our side one why do i think that was because i think actually

924
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:23,640
this generation i mean these 18 year olds right so they've or a bit older they they're the generation

925
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:30,280
who had porn like on their private computers on their phones from adolescence onwards i mean

926
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:38,680
i'm 30 so i didn't actually have my own smartphone or whatever until teens and above but these are

927
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:43,640
the kids who who had it from like adolescence and would would expect to be exposed to porn really

928
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:52,200
young and it was really formative in their sexuality and i think that it's hard not

929
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:59,640
to not to recognize the like the downsides of that the thing that i see online i don't know a

930
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:05,480
single guy that is pro porn guys are either neutral porn or anti porn like and the ones

931
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:10,920
that are anti porn are vehement about it do they tend to be anti porn from like

932
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:17,160
the ethical women stuff or because of the effect on them i can

933
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:24,520
not from the effect on women's stuff no um i think that i i i actually think that the guys

934
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:29,240
that are behaviorally addicted to porn or have got friends that do or are scared that they're

935
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:36,120
going to become it i actually think in part that they see the women that are um a part of the porn

936
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:41,560
machine as part of the oppressor i think that they think that they are creating the content which is

937
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:48,760
causing me to yeah i have to fap three or four times a day and and feel disgusted with myself or

938
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:53,000
waste time or you have this sort of super normal stimuli problem of not being able to get it up and

939
01:13:54,840 --> 01:14:00,840
yeah i mean it's another one of those things where everybody's losing you know it except the

940
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:06,440
owners of mind geek they're fine yeah didn't one of those one of those went on a podcast a few years

941
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:12,440
ago i remember hearing about how huge that mind geek empire is it's like more than 50% of all

942
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:17,480
porn streaming on the internet goes through them remembering that porn is still the biggest

943
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:24,280
traffic source on the internet and they've got it's wild yeah i uh aren't they british

944
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:29,880
basically known one of the guys british as well i'm sure no i'm canadian the guy who only fans is

945
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:34,280
british yes yeah he's uh i was trying to get him on i was trying to bring him on because he seems

946
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:38,680
like a very interesting guy and i was really fascinated by their attempted move away from

947
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:44,520
explicit content it was obvious that they had i don't think that that came from altruistic means

948
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:49,800
i think that that came from probably investor problems and shit to do with banks so chelsea

949
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:57,160
ferguson if you know her she owns admiami.vip which is another version of only fans she was on only

950
01:14:57,160 --> 01:15:00,760
fans she found out that it was a problem she's a friend i've been friends with her for a very long

951
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:05,080
time she was got a huge private snapchat she's been a stripper for a long time in newcastle

952
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:09,880
and she was telling me that she had to go to germany germany was the only place that she could

953
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:15,000
get a bank that would process payments when they found out what she was doing so the back end of

954
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:19,960
stuff i think that that was the the story about only fans wasn't that they were trying to clean

955
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:24,120
up the image it's that they were probably having investor problems and and operational shit on

956
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:29,800
the back end yeah interesting because that was one of the my memory of the timeline is that big

957
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:36,360
new york times piece about pawn hub and monkey came out and these are in particular possibly some

958
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:44,040
other companies i can't remember got a cold feet and thinking that they were inadvertently funding

959
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:49,240
child rape images and so i guess that that i mean i mean only fans has loads of kids on it

960
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:55,240
realistically and i know that they try they say that they try to make sure that it's only adults

961
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:59,480
but they can't realistically do that there are loads of stories anecdotally of girls

962
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:06,040
you know 14 15 year old girls whatever putting their images up there it is inevitable on any of

963
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:10,680
these platforms you can't really protect against it what do you mean when you say that people are

964
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:17,880
not products so that's yeah that's the when i mentioned at the beginning that i had that

965
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:24,920
big twitter storm about my uh about my chapter titles and that was kind of the most all these

966
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:29,320
like left-wing sex positive people absolutely outraged at me saying that people aren't products

967
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:33,960
i mean it comes back to the sexual disenchantment point that if you

968
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:42,040
if you really think that sex is meaningless it's just like making coffee blah blah blah

969
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:47,480
that people can just like sell sexual access to themselves like they'd sell any other kind of

970
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:53,800
service or any other kind of product like it's internally consistent and it's the sort of

971
01:16:55,320 --> 01:17:00,520
the the phrase that i use in that chapter is that it's the logic of the punter i mean that's

972
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:07,320
what punters think that they can just they don't really see prostitute women as being properly human

973
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:11,880
i think i mean based on the way that they write about them that doesn't that doesn't seem to be

974
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:19,080
how they view them there's like appalling review platforms online where punters will review

975
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:24,280
women that they've bought sex from and there's like no human feeling in there like there's like

976
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:30,120
true psychopathy on display so so like that probably is the only population who actually

977
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:37,800
believe in sexual disenchantment um the women they're buying sex from certainly don't and

978
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:46,840
and like thinking away from the more extreme end of it in terms of prostitution as well just

979
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:54,680
thinking about things like dating apps which are also kind of designed like they're also sort of

980
01:17:54,680 --> 01:18:00,120
continuous with the logic of the punter in that they are designed to be like shopping apps that's

981
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:05,240
how they feel you don't feel using them that different from using like asos or ebay or whatever

982
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:11,320
because you swipe swipe swipe and select your product um i mean or not of course if you're like

983
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:16,040
an incel who doesn't get any matches but for for for high status men and for women that is how it

984
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:19,560
that's how it's experienced and it's got a really really consumerist kind of

985
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:26,840
energy the cat the whole like casual sex phenomenon um which ought to be the sort of thing that the

986
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:32,040
left are really opposed to you know my my my colleagues at the new statesman like this ought

987
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:37,640
this ought to be you know we're talking about this multi-billion pound global empire of the

988
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:41,880
porn industry we're talking about a really consumerist attitude towards other people's

989
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:47,800
bodies and minds like this this this isn't conservative or it shouldn't be like this should be

990
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:53,960
101 anti-capitalist critique coming from the left but it isn't and i think that that's because

991
01:18:55,400 --> 01:19:03,640
a lot of people on the left have prioritized like owning the comms and are more interested

992
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:09,960
in tearing down bourgeois sexual norms and basically promoting free love at all costs

993
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:14,040
than they are in thinking about where this has actually led to a led us to and i think that this

994
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:21,320
the last 60 70 years post sexual revolution period has been has been in a big experiment

995
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:27,880
in what happens if you disconnect sex from reproduction and you basically discard all

996
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:35,000
of the like quite finely tuned norms that used to exist basically to keep young horny people

997
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:39,720
away from each other i mean the way that this is interpret this history is interpreted by feminist

998
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:45,720
often is is this all those social norms exist to control female sexuality and they did but they

999
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:51,000
also exist to control male sexuality and the purpose of it wasn't to oppress women it wasn't

1000
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:57,160
motivated by misogyny it was motivated by the fact that if sex leads to reproduction then that's

1001
01:19:57,160 --> 01:20:02,280
everyone's concern like that that matters to the community because if you've got people

1002
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:08,200
young couples producing illegitimate children like that's that matters to the family that matters

1003
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:15,160
to the community it it's it's essential in a world without contraception to control young

1004
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:20,520
people's sexuality and that's what those norms existed for and we threw them out the window

1005
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:27,400
very rapidly and we've basically seen this play out over the last however many decades and i think

1006
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:31,080
that the the results are in and they're not very promising

1007
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:38,120
that's really really good i i learned from mary when she came on the show

1008
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:44,840
about the fact that a lot of the rules and the norms that are set are by the elite and

1009
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:50,520
they're usually not the ones that suffer the impact it's a luxury belief right yeah to hold

1010
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:55,400
that um men don't need to hold the door open for you and that having chivalry and constraints on

1011
01:20:55,400 --> 01:21:02,680
male behavior that's not needed by some upper middle class woman whose husband has got a

1012
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:09,240
postgraduate degree because there are maybe levels of education or or norm enforcement

1013
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:13,240
that have occurred just through his upbringing and her upbringing that means that it doesn't matter

1014
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:19,400
what you don't think about is the the underclass or the working class guy and girl who perhaps

1015
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:24,920
haven't had those same sort of levels of norms enforced and maybe they don't know that not

1016
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:29,240
hitting your wife is that big of a deal and then when the culture starts to erode and evaporate

1017
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:36,200
that away you go well but the people that made the rules or that encourage the norms to be dissolved

1018
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:41,080
and not the ones that are suffering they're dissolving yeah rob henson actually i think

1019
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:46,120
uses polyamory as his one of his examples as he and his his original luxury beliefs i say

1020
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:53,960
where if you're a high status person let's say in like the bay area where everyone else polyamory

1021
01:21:54,760 --> 01:22:00,840
is really is just like cool and you can if it all falls in a heap it doesn't matter because you've

1022
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:05,960
got your money and your status and all of your stability to fall back on and everyone will just

1023
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:11,320
sort of think that you're a bit behemian whereas if you're a working class underclass woman who's

1024
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:16,360
basically you know living polyamory like having lots of different partners and lots of different

1025
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:22,760
children by them people one will think you're trash but two like your life becomes so challenging

1026
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:27,720
because you've got you've got all these children to look after and you don't have the reliable

1027
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:34,760
support of a partner and like you're at risk of absolutely everything falling apart but but this

1028
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:39,960
is but yeah it is a luxury belief in the sense that saying that that's a good thing and and and

1029
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:49,880
resisting the um resisting the traditional norms that used to that used to exist gives status to

1030
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:57,160
rich people well think about i i i really like the idea that um beating the other side was more

1031
01:22:57,160 --> 01:23:02,040
important than raising up the people of your political party and i think that that's very true

1032
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:09,720
there was a study that i saw around about 2012 surveys of democrats and republicans the um

1033
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:15,800
proportions twisted and they they flipped from i vote for my party because i like my party to

1034
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:21,160
i vote for my party because i dislike the other party pretty much more people were doing protest

1035
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:27,320
votes because of a hatred of the other rather than a love of the similar yeah you go well

1036
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:32,760
how easily is that to be weaponized you know and how how many perverse incentives are you

1037
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:38,680
going to create there you mentioned at the beginning about um how my book will be received in america

1038
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:46,360
and um not all but a lot of the a lot of my friends who are also writing on similar things

1039
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:54,040
like mary and nina and so on are british and british feminism is much more it's much more

1040
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:59,800
permissible to say this stuff than it is in the states in general and i think the reason for that

1041
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:06,280
is that we don't really have a christian right in the uk so there isn't really any like fearsome

1042
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:11,480
enemy that we all need to be focused against and things like abortion rights are rock solid pretty

1043
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:18,440
much like not in ireland but in the mainland uk um like that doesn't feel under threat and

1044
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:24,360
i think that's what it is that because i think american feminism is just so focused all the time

1045
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:29,320
on like often shadow boxing against the christian right in the sense that i think they overstate

1046
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:33,000
their influence in their power and there's and they're kind of stuck in the past a little bit

1047
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:39,240
and there's this like underdog mentality that we things like constantly having to reassert like oh

1048
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:43,960
you shouldn't be ashamed of sex you should be you know it's like we've won that fight come on

1049
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:49,800
i think it's like look at any any newspaper magazine tv channel whatever like the idea

1050
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:55,000
that women are not allowed to say they enjoy sex it's like 50 years out of date come on so they're

1051
01:24:55,000 --> 01:25:03,160
so focused on a like somewhat imaginary enemy that they can't actually interrogate the coherence

1052
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:08,920
of their own views whereas they think in the uk that isn't that isn't so much the case at all

1053
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:15,800
and actually there's a lot more things like trans politics or whatever which we haven't

1054
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:21,960
gone into in in this discussion but is is much more cross-party is not there isn't this like

1055
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:29,000
really fierce dichotomy politically which i think gives more space for thinking critically

1056
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:34,920
like i i feel like i can write this book and i'm not going to get pegged as a crazy conservative

1057
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:41,160
i might be wrong about that we'll wait and see how should people act then given all of this

1058
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:47,400
everything that we've gone through how should people act so i mean i i i do basically make the

1059
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:53,800
case in the book for for for being a bit more old-fashioned on some stuff like i a lot of a

1060
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:59,320
lot of that section of it is directed more at women than at men so like i think for instance

1061
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:03,720
it's a good idea for women not to have sex on the first date or not even to have sex in the first

1062
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:09,240
three months because that that gives you the opportunity to assess whether or not he considers

1063
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:16,920
you to be good time only or if your wife material stuff like that which like you could basically

1064
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:25,160
read in most agony answer from like the 1950s which is obviously what i get accused of in my

1065
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:30,040
reviews um but also they like there was there was a reason for it it wasn't it wasn't motivated by

1066
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:36,040
misogyny you know there was a there was like a proper principle behind it um i mean similarly for

1067
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:39,880
men i i mean i don't know what i don't know what advice i have to offer fit in the cells to be honest

1068
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:44,680
i think i'm probably not the right person to offer any kind of advice because

1069
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:51,480
typically they don't like advice in any case no from like a fish teaching a fisherman how to fish

1070
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:57,560
type thing yeah it just it goes down badly i had a nama kates on um a couple of months maybe six

1071
01:26:57,560 --> 01:27:01,400
months ago and she's done tons of work tons of research like first hand research into it

1072
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:06,120
a lot of people were unhappy about the fact that she wasn't someone that could understand their

1073
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:11,400
plight um so okay so for women don't have sex on the first date not having sex for three months

1074
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:16,280
so there's an interesting uh insight i learned from jeffrey miller evolutionary psychologist so

1075
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:20,040
his book mate that he wrote with tucker max which should have been so much bigger than it was

1076
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:24,360
it's such a shame that it didn't do like mental numbers because it's great he explained about

1077
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:30,920
how um slut shaming is a sort of game theoretic enforcement mechanism to ensure that the price

1078
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:36,040
of sex doesn't descend lower than women want it to which is why most women are the enforcers of

1079
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:41,160
slut shaming not men men actually have an incentive for slut shaming to go away um yeah

1080
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:49,800
but one of the problems that you have here is you can kind of see ease of sex or or or speed

1081
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:56,760
towards um being accepting of having sex with a potential new partner as kind of being a price

1082
01:27:56,760 --> 01:28:00,920
right and as you start to extend that out the price that the man has to pay continues to go up

1083
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:06,040
and up and up so you really do need a bit of a god's eye view because if every woman tomorrow said

1084
01:28:06,040 --> 01:28:10,440
right no sex until three months that's fine that's the playing field maybe you would have more men

1085
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:14,040
that would sort of duck out of the dating game but over time they would acclimatize right because

1086
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:20,600
we acclimatize to no sex before marriage that was there so yeah i think okay so what else what

1087
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:27,400
else can people do i mean yeah so on that point about um yeah i mean strike breakers

1088
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:34,840
really for everyone else the i think that one of the things i hope comes from the book is that

1089
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:40,040
a lot of young women in particular because they've not yet learned through life experience are

1090
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:44,680
phenomenally ignorant about the reality of male sexuality and the reality of sexual difference

1091
01:28:45,480 --> 01:28:50,840
and so don't realize for instance some of what we've spoken about the fact that like um the sexual

1092
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:57,640
double standard is alive and well and um a lot of like men can have a motion of sex in a way that

1093
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:03,080
women can't and all of this and so we'll interpret for instance um

1094
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:09,400
though they will misinterpret a lot of male behavior and end up making decisions that

1095
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:12,920
actually not in their best interest because they they think that you know the guy who wants to sleep

1096
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:19,080
with them must want something more from them afterwards and then and then i like you know

1097
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:25,720
learn the hard way that that's not true and i think that actually if if there was more

1098
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:33,080
knowledge widespread knowledge about the existence of these facts i think actually that

1099
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:37,480
young women's behavior could change quite quickly because at the moment for instance the

1100
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:43,560
like you go on tiktok or whatever and you get young women will do things like show off their

1101
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:47,800
bruises that they've got from having rough sex with men who like obviously hate them

1102
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:52,360
but they're a it's a status symbol because it's a sign of being oh look i'm so attractive i mean

1103
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:58,360
particularly things like choking a lot of women interpret choking as being a sign of like passionate

1104
01:29:58,360 --> 01:30:03,720
love like in like a 50 shades of gray way like i want you so much i'll do anything to have you

1105
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:08,760
is the way that this is like interpreted in the romantic imagination that's not generally have

1106
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:14,200
the men who are doing it interpret it at all so there's this like mutual miscomprehension

1107
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:18,840
where each sex is doing something they actually don't like realize how the other side is interpreting

1108
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:23,480
it i think if more women realized that it would it would no longer be high status to be showing

1109
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:28,440
off your bruises on tiktok because actually the like the truth of it is that basically any

1110
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:33,800
moderately good-looking young women can get as many partners as she wants and can get them to do

1111
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:42,280
you know if she if if she asks them to choke her they will it's not a sign of being super attractive

1112
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:48,360
but it's misinterpreted as being as such so i think that if there were more

1113
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:53,400
i think there was a better understanding than some of the incentives would change

1114
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:56,520
which would be a good thing for young women

1115
01:30:57,480 --> 01:31:04,760
louise perry ladies and gentlemen i really really enjoyed the book i think that the group of women

1116
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:10,040
that we've got in the uk you mary nina we need to come up with a new net this can be a public

1117
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:15,480
service announcement to the people that are still listening um before we started we came up with the

1118
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:22,120
name of based british women but then realized that the acronym of bbw can be problematic

1119
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:28,120
so if you've got an alternative that the girls can use that would be great um but yeah i i think

1120
01:31:28,120 --> 01:31:32,360
that it's really great i'd i really really like all of the work that you guys have put out um

1121
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:35,000
where should people go they want to read more of your stuff online where should they go

1122
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:40,280
so there's a book obviously which is out already in the uk the case against sexual

1123
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:47,480
