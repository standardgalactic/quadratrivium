00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Korea had no future.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
At their current fertility rate right now,

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
for every 100 Koreans, there will be 5.9 great grandchildren.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
We are looking at a 94% population collapse over the next century.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
Why have you been in the news so much recently?

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
Because I am calling out that the emperor has no clothes right now,

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
and I think a lot of people have mentioned collapsing fertility rates before,

00:28.000 --> 00:34.000
but I think that no one has really so consistently

00:34.000 --> 00:40.000
brought it up in a way that the people who want to ignore it

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
have to look at the problem.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
When I point it out, because I think a lot of people,

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
especially on the more progressive side of the spectrum,

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
they just want to dismiss it.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Oh, the planet's better without humans or whatever.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
But when you point out that not a single society on Earth today,

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
except for maybe Israel, we can talk about that later in the conversation,

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
has figured out how to have prosperity, gender equality,

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
and high levels of education, and anywhere close to a stable population,

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
considering we are trying our best, and I think rightfully so,

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
to spread those things across the world,

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
that should be like a note.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
That should be like, oh, this system that we think is so great

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
and we want to be the future of human civilization doesn't seem to work

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
at the most basic level.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
That seems like quite a scary proselytization for the future,

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
or prediction for the future.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
If you're to say that we need to get rid of one from education, equality,

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
prosperity, or birth rate,

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
we just need to concede the fact that birth rate.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
What we need to do is we need to find new cultural solutions.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
We need to find a way to maintain fertility rates

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
while having education, while having gender equality,

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
and while having a high level of prosperity.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
There are many places we can look in the world today

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
to begin to get inspiration for how we might do that.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
I think to understand the scale of the threat right now,

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
one of the things I always start people with is when I started caring about this.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
A lot of people are like, why is it that people in Silicon Valley

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
seem to care about this so much?

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
It's because there's a lot of VCs in Silicon Valley,

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
VCs need to chart the economy 50-100 years in the future

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
in the way that Wall Street people really don't.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
They're looking at the economy 5-10 years out or whatever.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Because of that, when I was working as a VC,

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
I happened to be working in Korea when I was working in a VC,

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
and I kept trying to chart the future of the economy,

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
and I kept coming to the same answer.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
Is it Korea had no future?

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
At their current fertility rate right now,

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
for every 100 Koreans, there will be 5.9 great-grandchildren.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
We are looking at a 94% population collapse over the next century.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
When I brought this up with the other partners at my firm,

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
and I was like, hey, it just doesn't seem like

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
there is any feasible economic future for this country.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
They're like, yeah, but we pretend that's not the case in our investments.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
Everybody knows this, but if we accepted it,

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
then the economy stops working, society stops working.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
We're just going to ignore it basically.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
When I came back to the US, it was like going back in time 20 years.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
I was in some sort of a sci-fi movie,

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
and getting to be this one person who saw where the future was going to go,

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
and having to be that crazy person on the streets.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
No, no, no, you guys don't understand.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
There's countries further ahead than us on this spectrum right now,

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
and we know a few things. We know there is no floor.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
No country has hit a fertility collapse floor yet.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
We know that there is no level of advanced fertility collapse where people freak out,

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
or at least not until it's too late, because you look at Korea right now,

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
60% of Korean citizens are over the age of 40.

03:47.000 --> 03:52.000
It's likely already too late for them to turn this problem around.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
We need to turn this around before we hit that level,

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
but the truth is we probably won't,

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
and we've got to think of solutions for when we don't turn this around,

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
but that's a different topic for later in the interview.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
One of the most common questions I imagine that people ask is,

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
why should anyone care about how many children another person has?

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
This is my choice.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
You can't impose me to have kids if I don't want to have them.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
Why should two guys sat on the Internet be telling the world

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
about the dangers of not having children?

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
People can go and do other things with their lives now.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Women are allowed to be in the workplace.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
Men can go their own way and play video games

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
and be a Sigma male as much as they want.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
Why should anyone care about how many children another person has?

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
So I think that that's a really good point.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
In our foundation, I think one of the things that people most often get wrong about us

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
is that we are trying to increase the world's population

04:46.000 --> 04:52.000
or that we are trying to proselytize broadly to increase fertility rates.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
And neither one of those things is true.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
If we are on the Titanic right now,

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
no matter what the Titanic hits the iceberg,

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
we are trying to, one, make people aware that the Titanic is about to hit an iceberg,

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
get them in lines by the rafts, the ones who want to survive,

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
start getting the rafts in the water in a common orderly fashion before people start panicking

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
because that's what's going to happen.

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
And so what we promote is trying to get,

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
I mean, I know my family is going to be okay.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
You know, I know that my cultural group is going to be okay.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
Broadly speaking, so one, I know that my family,

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
you know, I have eight kids and they have eight kids

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
and you do that for 11 generations.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
That's more descendants than exists in the world today, I often say.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
So I don't need to worry about people like me.

05:35.000 --> 05:40.000
The reason I'm so loud about this is because I'm worried about the massive collapse

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
in cultural and ethnic diversity the world is about to see.

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
And it will be astonishing for people.

05:49.000 --> 05:54.000
I think in the far future, there were more than like three ethnic groups

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
and three cultural groups or something like that if we don't solve this.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
And so what we're trying to do is just make people aware of this

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
because so much of the propaganda that people are consuming is telling them,

06:03.000 --> 06:08.000
things are fine, have less kids, you're a good person if you have less kids.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
And I know you've talked about this before on the show and it is, it is astonishing.

06:12.000 --> 06:19.000
And I think when we look at this urban monoculture that is erasing all of the genuine diversity in our society,

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
one of its core messages is negative utilitarianism.

06:22.000 --> 06:27.000
That the core evil thing in the world is human suffering

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
and that human happiness just doesn't really matter

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
or it is largely outweighed by human suffering.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
And therefore it's better if humans don't exist.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
And that's the end goal for the urban monoculture.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
I think for a lot of people.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
What do you mean when you say urban monoculture?

06:40.000 --> 06:45.000
Well, okay, so this sort of gets down to like my personal politics to some extent.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
But I think that if you look at society right now,

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
it's largely becoming divided into two factions

06:51.000 --> 06:56.000
and there has been a major political shift around what conservative and progressive means.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
The progressive is a party of this urban monoculture,

07:00.000 --> 07:06.000
which is a single sort of cultural group or virus that infects other cultural institutions

07:06.000 --> 07:11.000
and erases whatever makes them unique and aligns all of their goals.

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
So if I talk with a progressive Muslim or a progressive Jew or a progressive Catholic

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
or a progressive Unitarian Universalist and I scratch beneath the surface,

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
often their morals, their views on gender,

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
their views on what future they want for the world are all very, very similar.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
If I look at conservatives from each of those factions,

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
their worldviews are very different.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
And what the conservative party seems optimizing around,

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
so where the liberal party is optimizing on the goals of this monoculture,

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
so spreading the monoculture and reducing in the moment human suffering,

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
that's why they promote things like haze,

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
you know, like don't tell somebody that it's unhealthy to be fat

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
because that could hurt their feelings in the moment,

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
even though like obviously it's bad for them in the long term.

07:50.000 --> 07:57.000
But the conservative movements all have very distinct cultural histories

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
which they are trying to preserve.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
And that is often, if I look at the conservative movement today,

08:02.000 --> 08:08.000
it's an alliance of these older traditions and newer but deviant and distinct traditions

08:08.000 --> 08:14.000
that are trying to maintain cultural fidelity and exist 100, 200 years from now.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
And so when I talk about the monoculture, that's what I'm talking about.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
This thing that wants to, when my kids go to school, say,

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
this is what correct morality is, this is the way you should see the world.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
And if your parents are telling you anything else, they're deplorable and wrong.

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
Is that not the case with some factions from a conservative side as well, though?

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
Yeah, yeah, no, and I call them sleeper progressives.

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
They just want to erase all other cultures the moment they gave power.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
But I think that right now I can form an alliance with them because our goals are aligned.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
I think one of the really cool things that we've seen with the conservative party

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
is you saw something like when Andrew Tate converted to Islam.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
In the past, a conservative icon converting to Islam,

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
a lot of people would have been wringing their hands about that,

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
but a lot of people were like, you go.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
At least you found some faith, at least you found some tradition.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
And so I think what we're seeing there is more of a realization

09:01.000 --> 09:07.000
that the big bad these days is this culture that's trying to homogenize the world.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Interesting.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
What would you say to the well-meaning people from the progressive movement

09:11.000 --> 09:16.000
to say it feels a little bit bad to be tarnished with the brush as a super virus?

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
I think that I'm just somebody that holds liberal values.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
I don't believe that I'm part of some destructive force within the world.

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
And I think that there are people who genuinely, like within any movement,

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
when the Catholic Church used to be the iteration of this in European society

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
and they were trying to convert everyone to their ways.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
And the Protestant Church during their own time had a period like that in some countries.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
The vast majority of Protestants, their Catholics in those countries,

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
were just decent, well-meaning people trying to live their lives.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
But the ones who controlled the cultural institutions

09:47.000 --> 09:52.000
and were burning people at the stake and trying to ensure that everybody fit

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
this very narrow definition of morality set by their culture,

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
to me they were the evil ones within those institutions.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
And today, when I talk about this monoculture,

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
I think that the vast majority of people who are members of it

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
were the vast majority of Catholics and Protestants during periods

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
when those cultural groups were dominant in specific regions.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Why is this culture so effective?

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Very interesting.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
Okay, so it's evolved a lot of new tactics that had never been tried before.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
So in our book, The Pragmatist Guide to Crafting Religion,

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
what we essentially do is we argue that humanity can be thought of

10:28.000 --> 10:33.000
as sort of an evolving firmware, which is like our biology, our genes.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
But on top of that firmware, there's evolving sets of software.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
And this software, today we often talk about memes

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
as like things that infect somebody and then cause them to just turn around

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
and infect other people.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
But historically, most romantic clusters actually augmented a person's

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
sort of biological fitness, the number of surviving offspring they had,

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
and that's how they survived.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
That's how, I mean, if you look at things with a secular mindset,

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
why things like Islam and Judaism figured out stuff like handwashing

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
literally centuries before science figured out handwashing.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
And you see this across these traditions.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
For example, if you look at all of the old traditions,

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
almost all of them have some arbitrary self-denial holiday,

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
like Lent or Ramadan or Feast of the First Burner, whatever, right?

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
And just now, after throwing out all of those rituals over the past,

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
you know, 50, 100 years, secular society is like,

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
oh, now we got to have our juice cleanses.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
Now we got to have our, you know, they're realizing of fasting

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
and stuff like that, right?

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
It has positive mental effects.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
And so I think that if you see these as different,

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
like evolving cultural groups,

11:35.000 --> 11:40.000
this super virus evolved some very unique tactics,

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
and it is not the same thing as a historic progressive movement.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
What it is is something, so the reason I call it a super virus is

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
that it is very much so when you talk about a super bacteria

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
or a super bug, they typically come up in things like hospitals

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
where you have a ton of people with a weakened immune system

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
all in a similar environment with lots of sort of viruses or bacteria

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
that can intermingle alongside antibiotics and stuff like that.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
This is what was created by the internet.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
This is why all of this stuff started when social media happened.

12:09.000 --> 12:16.000
Essentially, you had a super spreader environment where pneumatic ideas

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
were able to test themselves against all of the world's traditions

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
at the same time, optimize and react very quickly

12:23.000 --> 12:29.000
and become incredibly virulent while evolving strategies

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
that had never been tried before.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
So one of the most effective strategies that it uses

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
is if you look historically,

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
if you look at cultural groups as sort of like nodal clouds

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
that sort of overlap with each other,

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
when you had a corrupted node within a nodal cloud

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
or a node that looked like it was flipping,

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
what you would do if you were a majority Protestant country

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
or majority Catholic country and like a Catholic came in

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
and started preaching or a Protestant came in and started preaching,

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
you'd burn them.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
You'd burn them at the stake often, right?

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
Or if somebody just had like random cultural mutation

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
in the same way you have like random genetic mutation

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
and they believe something weird like they were a witch

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
and you burn them, right?

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
That's how you maintain this level of cultural fidelity.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
What the virus does, which is very interesting,

13:09.000 --> 13:15.000
is it organically determines when a node looks like it might be flipping

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
and then it essentially shadow bands the node.

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
It begins to de-connect that node's links

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
to all of the rest of the network's power structures.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
And this is really powerful because what it means

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
is the other nodes that might be allied with that node,

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
they don't react the way they would have historically

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
when somebody was being like burned at the stake or something like that,

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
which is actually why cancellation is a fairly ineffective tactic

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
and genuinely not use that much

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
when contrasted with just a shadow banding process

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
of the person just doesn't get a promotion

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
if it looks like they might be immune to these ideas.

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
They just don't, you know, their papers get published a little less.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
You know, certain platforms begin to favor them less

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
because of the algorithm.

13:57.000 --> 14:02.000
And that's how it has been able to maintain such control,

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
I think, of the upper echelons of our society.

14:05.000 --> 14:10.000
But it's not like every organization is run by a progressive movement, right?

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
There are organizations out there that seem to be a lot more open to new ideas.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
We're seeing pushback from a variety of places to the opportunity

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
for people to have independent jobs.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
So I would say that it's not every organization.

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
So it specifically targets the organizations it can best use

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
to maintain its population levels.

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
And so those are typically organizations that are involved in education.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
So you're looking at the middle school system,

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
the high school system and the college system

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
or the organization that it is most critical that it maintains

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
an absolute strangleholdover.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
And this again comes to fertility issues.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Of the populations of the world,

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
if there is one population that has a very low birth rate,

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
it is this population, this urban monoculture.

14:53.000 --> 15:00.000
And because of that, the only way it can repopulate its ideological faction

15:00.000 --> 15:05.000
is through siphoning children from other often more conservative cultural traditions

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
or in other ways, deviant cultural traditions

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
that are for whatever reason, having a lot of kids.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
Okay, getting back to fertility,

15:13.000 --> 15:18.000
what groups are doing particularly well and particularly badly when it comes to fertility?

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
This is a fascinating question.

15:20.000 --> 15:25.000
All right, so if you look in a post-prosperity environment,

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
so a lot of people, they're like,

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
oh, well, countries in Africa are doing really well.

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
They have high fertility rates or Muslim populations have high fertility rates.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
And it's like, well, that's irrelevant of those populations

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
or in a country where the average salary is under $5,000 a year,

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
because that is where you get above replacement fertility

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
in pretty much every country that's under $5,000 a year, you get above replacement.

15:44.000 --> 15:48.000
Every country above $5,000 a year, you typically get below replacement fertility.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
And so it's a level of desperate poverty, first of all,

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
that is often misconstrued.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
So you look at Latin America, Central America, South America, the Caribbean,

15:55.000 --> 16:00.000
collectively as of 2019, so old news, they fell below repopulation rate.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
So it's really just a few of these poorest countries.

16:03.000 --> 16:08.000
So I really ignore any country at a high fertility if it's a poor country

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
or if it's not a wealthy country, right?

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
And so I think where you can see is some misunderstandings that people have from that.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
So you look at populations like Muslim populations,

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
when they enter wealthier countries, their populations really crash

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
or when the countries where they are the dominant social group.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
So you can look at Iran.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
Iran's fertility rate fell above, below replacement a long time ago.

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
And since 2014, they've been trying pretty much everything in their power

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
to try to get fertility rates back above repopulation rate.

16:32.000 --> 16:36.000
And their government has a lot of control over the populace and they are not able to.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
They're still only at 1.7.

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
So the groups that really show resistance to this are conservative Christian groups

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
and conservative Jewish groups.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
And this is why I always think it's funny when people are like,

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
oh, you're talking about fertility rates, you must be about saving white people.

16:49.000 --> 16:53.000
And it's like white conservative people are like the only people on earth

16:53.000 --> 16:59.000
who don't seem to be disappearing in the face of prosperity induced fertility collapse.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
The groups that are most at risk are the Eastern traditions.

17:01.000 --> 17:05.000
Even conservative iterations of those traditions are very bad

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
at resisting prosperity induced fertility collapse.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
Prosperity induced fertility collapse.

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
What is the relationship between prosperity and fertility?

17:15.000 --> 17:19.000
Well, as I said, typically when a country earns over 5,000 USD a year,

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
fertility begins to fall below replacement rate.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Yes, why?

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
Oh, well, so this is what we can say is nobody quite knows,

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
but there is some evidence as to what might be causing this.

17:29.000 --> 17:34.000
What is probably causing it is the ability to engage with a modern economy.

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
So when somebody is not engaged with the modern economy

17:38.000 --> 17:43.000
and not valuable to the modern economy, then the modern economy basically ignores them

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
and they go on living the way humans have always lived and having a lot of kids.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
This is why within developed countries.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
So if you look at a country like the US, right,

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
typically the less money you make, the more kids you have,

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
except when you're at the very high end of the income spectrum.

17:57.000 --> 18:02.000
So if you're making an average of half a million dollars a year or more as a family,

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
you will be at above replacement fertility.

18:04.000 --> 18:10.000
And in many ways families at that income level are just not like the economy isn't grabbing them as much

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
because they don't need the economy as much.

18:12.000 --> 18:16.000
So what's really happening is if you look at our sort of free market structure,

18:16.000 --> 18:22.000
what it does is it organically determines how to reward anyone who has the probability

18:22.000 --> 18:28.000
that it believes has the probability of being productive with just enough money

18:28.000 --> 18:33.000
to get them to spend their time being productive versus doing anything else

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
that may have long-term benefits to the society like having kids or whatever, right?

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
And it's very, very good at doing this.

18:39.000 --> 18:45.000
And then it draws them into environments like cities where it becomes even harder to have kids

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
and where they can, anyway, yeah, where they can be more productive

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
and spend more time working and generating money for this larger economic system.

18:53.000 --> 18:58.000
I was going to say it doesn't seem like, it doesn't seem realistic

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
that this could be a large behemoth,

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
evil-y behind the scenes working to try and get fertility rates down.

19:06.000 --> 19:10.000
It seems more likely that it is a natural byproduct of a capitalist machine

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
that wants to have workers who are available as much as possible

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
who don't take maternity or paternity leave,

19:15.000 --> 19:20.000
who are buying their clothes and taking their holidays,

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
consuming and producing and pumping money back into the system.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
Is that the way that you see it?

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
I absolutely agree with everything you're saying there.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
And that's also what I mean when I talk about the virus.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
I don't think any decision is made maliciously.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
I think everybody thinks they're a good guy.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Everyone's trying to do what they think is best for the world.

19:34.000 --> 19:41.000
But sometimes sort of cultural evolutionary pressures can create incentive systems

19:41.000 --> 19:46.000
that lead to actions that in the long term will have consequences

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
that I think most people would think are bad.

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
Okay, at the beginning you mentioned a bunch of other contributing factors,

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
prosperity being one of them.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
What were the other elements?

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
Gender equality and education are typically the other two.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
Run us through those.

20:00.000 --> 20:06.000
Well, gender equality, it is often specifically female education.

20:07.000 --> 20:14.000
When women begin to have a choice as to what they do and can participate in the economy,

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
I don't think that it's that they're choosing not to have kids.

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
I think that that is a misunderstanding of what we're seeing in the data.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
I think it's that they prioritize economic stability

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
and basically having their life in order before they decide to start having kids.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
But the way our economic system is structured,

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
people often don't really feel they have their life in order

20:35.000 --> 20:40.000
until they're mid-30s or 40s and at that time they can no longer have kids.

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
And so I think that that is why.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
It is not that women are choosing jobs over kids,

20:46.000 --> 20:51.000
it's that they're choosing jobs then kids and their biological clocks run out.

20:51.000 --> 20:56.000
While at the same time, and I think this is something that's really undersold

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
when people talk about fertility collapse,

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
is the absolute collapse of marriage markets in our society.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
I saw a tweet and I couldn't agree with it more.

21:04.000 --> 21:09.000
Being in a happy marriage these days feels a bit like catching the last chopper at an arm

21:09.000 --> 21:14.000
because it is hard out there to find a good partner.

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
And we have seen a collapse of the systems that previously

21:18.000 --> 21:23.000
ensured people found great long-term dedicated partners.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
Well, that's the point.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
It's not just about declining birth rates.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
It's also about declining dating.

21:28.000 --> 21:35.000
So 50% of guys aged 18 to 30 say that they are not looking for casual or long-term relationships.

21:35.000 --> 21:40.000
I mean, you know, that's an unbelievably shocking statistic to say that

21:40.000 --> 21:45.000
your natural biological inclination as a guy during the period of your life

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
when you're going to have the highest testosterone you're going to have

21:48.000 --> 21:52.000
is just checking out completely of either casual or long-term relationships.

21:52.000 --> 21:56.000
The same thing goes for women broadly as well that it's just not good.

21:56.000 --> 22:02.000
So how do you fold in this decline in dating as well as children?

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
I mean, how do you fold it in?

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
What I just say is it's a problem.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
And one of the things we look at, I mean, we've written multiple books on like

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
The Pragmatist Guide to Relationships, The Pragmatist Guide to Sexuality,

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
looking at this problem, trying to come up with solutions to this problem.

22:17.000 --> 22:22.000
And I think that this brings us to what the real solution to this problem is in a broader context.

22:22.000 --> 22:27.000
Not just dating, not just, but also fertility collapse, also the cultural.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
So whenever anybody first hears about fertility collapse,

22:30.000 --> 22:35.000
they often want to use it as a way to justify I think the talking points

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
they wanted to push before it became a problem on their table.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
Like as soon as they accept it's a problem, then they're like,

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
oh, I can use this to push things I wanted to push already.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
So they'll say things like, oh, well, you should do cash handouts,

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
except we know that doesn't really work.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
You know, Hungary spent 5% of its GDP last year doing it

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
and they got the fertility rate up by like 1.6%.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
When it's dropping like 3% year every year in a lot of places in the world,

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
that's really irrelevant.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
Like China, 2020, drop 20%.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
2021, drop 13%.

23:01.000 --> 23:06.000
In 2022, COVID lockdowns are over, it should be going up, only went up 0.18%.

23:06.000 --> 23:13.000
You know, so you're just seeing a 1.6% increase for 5% of your GDP is irrelevant.

23:13.000 --> 23:17.000
So, and people are often like, well, you could spend more.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
What if you spent 50% of your GDP on this?

23:19.000 --> 23:24.000
But if it's naturally dropping every year, then you can never catch that toad

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
if you're doing it by spending money.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
And it's the same with things like free childcare.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
God, I would like free childcare.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
You know, I plan to have seven kids or something like that.

23:32.000 --> 23:36.000
But in the countries that offer it, it does seem to help fertility a little bit,

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
like maybe like 3% or 4%, which is a pretty good amount.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
But it's not enough to offset the trends that we see.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
And then you talk to conservative groups and they're like,

23:44.000 --> 23:48.000
well, what we should do is, and I'm talking far conservative groups,

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
not ones like me, but they're like, we should create estates, basically.

23:51.000 --> 23:55.000
You know, stop immigration, have one culture, one country.

23:55.000 --> 24:00.000
Except if you actually look at the statistics, the countries in prosperous countries

24:00.000 --> 24:04.000
with the lowest fertility rates are often estates, you know, like South Korea, stuff like that.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
You look at the countries that have been most resistant to fertility collapse

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
in the prosperous world, you're looking at countries like Israel in the U.S.,

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
some of the most diverse countries.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
And you can even see this with cultural groups across countries.

24:16.000 --> 24:20.000
So you look at like Iran, remember I mentioned Iran famously has a real big fertility country

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
and they're basically a Shia monoculture.

24:23.000 --> 24:27.000
But you look at Shia Muslims in India at similar economic levels where it's much more diverse

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
and their fertility rates like twice what it is in Iran.

24:30.000 --> 24:34.000
So I think that that's the first thing.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
So then the second question becomes, well, how do you actually solve this problem?

24:37.000 --> 24:41.000
Right? You look around the world and we've already talked about it.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
I mean, the solutions sort of staring us in the face,

24:43.000 --> 24:50.000
the groups that are resistant to this are the ones that deviate in some way from the urban monoculture.

24:50.000 --> 24:56.000
Most of them are traditionalist religious groups and there are some traditionalist religious groups

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
that are more resistant to this fertility collapse than others.

24:59.000 --> 25:04.000
And some that seemed like they were resistant and then all of a sudden collapsed.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
Mormons are an example of this.

25:05.000 --> 25:09.000
Like Mormons had great fertility rates than like five or six years ago,

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
something happened and now they're probably below replacement rate.

25:12.000 --> 25:21.000
And so what that tells me is that the solution to this is going to come at the level of cultural experimentation,

25:21.000 --> 25:26.000
both fortifying our traditional cultures to be more resistant to the new threats they're facing,

25:26.000 --> 25:33.000
but also potentially inventing new cultures that work with technology, the internet,

25:33.000 --> 25:37.000
new strategies that are open to us, which is what my family is trying to do.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
Tell me more about that.

25:39.000 --> 25:43.000
Okay. Yeah. All right, so I can go deeper into this.

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
So we have everything from like our own traditions of the family,

25:46.000 --> 25:51.000
our own sort of the moral framework, different ways of naming our kids,

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
different ways of dressing to an extent, like we look weird to other people.

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
And a lot of people are like you guys look like freaks.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
Don't you know your kids will be weird?

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
Don't you know they'll be bullied?

25:59.000 --> 26:03.000
And I go, you know, look around the world, which families,

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
which cultures are going to exist in the future?

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
It's one's like the Amish, the Hasidic.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
You know, wherever you look, they look different.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
They dress different.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
They name their kids different things.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
It's because when you call something cringe,

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
when you call something different or weird or freaky,

26:19.000 --> 26:25.000
what you are saying is it differentiates from the cultural norms to which you are accustomed.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
Those cultural norms became the dominant cultural norms

26:28.000 --> 26:33.000
because they had a good immune system, because they were good at dehumanizing the other

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
and calling people freaky and stuff like that.

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
But the reality is that if you want to join this game,

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
and this is why I'm out here, this is why I'm yelling,

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
I don't want a future where it's just my kids is a failure, right?

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
Where it's just my family.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
I want as much diversity into the future as possible.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
That's why I'm shouting this.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
I want people to join us.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
I want them to experiment and fortify themselves

26:51.000 --> 26:56.000
and not become overly complacent with their existing traditions

26:56.000 --> 27:01.000
if their kids are being effectively peeled out by this monoculture.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
It's very interesting to me.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
You know, I sometimes hear people in the rain.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
Why don't you just convert to like a traditional religious framework?

27:07.000 --> 27:12.000
And it's because most of those frameworks are right now on the downtrend

27:12.000 --> 27:16.000
in terms of their ability to continue a high fidelity and maintain their kids.

27:16.000 --> 27:21.000
I do want them to find new systems to protect themselves against that.

27:21.000 --> 27:27.000
But that's why that's just going to traditions isn't the answer anymore.

27:27.000 --> 27:33.000
The virus or whatever you want to call it has gotten too good at finding kids.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
And so we have to find new systems.

27:35.000 --> 27:40.000
And also just the environment the kids are in with internet, with social media.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
It's so different.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
And then with AI that they're going to face.

27:43.000 --> 27:47.000
How do you keep your kid from dating an AI girlfriend when they can have a deep fake

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
that's perfect and hot and loves them, right?

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
They need to want something other than hedonism.

27:53.000 --> 27:58.000
And that's a difficult message to convey to kids if they adopt the dominant social mores today.

27:58.000 --> 28:06.000
So to recap what you were talking about to do with this sort of almost monotheistic future

28:06.000 --> 28:12.000
or this sort of monoculture future that we would end up with if birth rate decline continues.

28:12.000 --> 28:16.000
For the people that might look at this and say, well, this is you trying to put forth

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
you want it to be a white ethno state.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
You want it to be more of your progeny that are out there.

28:21.000 --> 28:26.000
Your point is that that is the subgroup which is one of the few

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
which are continuing to be okay at the moment.

28:28.000 --> 28:34.000
We're actually going to lose genetic and racial diversity if we allow the current trends to continue

28:34.000 --> 28:39.000
because some of the groups that are reproducing with the lowest fertility rates

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
are the ones that add to that diversity.

28:41.000 --> 28:46.000
So in the future what you end up with is a very small number of different cohorts

28:46.000 --> 28:50.000
of stuff like Amish stuff like not even Mormons apparently anymore

28:50.000 --> 28:55.000
who are then downstream going to be the ones that fill out the entire country.

28:55.000 --> 29:00.000
Yeah, if we do nothing, the future is really just conservative Christians

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
and conservative Jews and maybe conservative Muslims.

29:03.000 --> 29:07.000
Those seem to be the only groups that are just like persistently resistant to this.

29:07.000 --> 29:12.000
So that's a pretty sort of bland future racially from...

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
Yeah, and there's some groups that in the very near future

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
like if I was looking at this like an ecologist, right,

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
like the groups I would be probably most concerned about right now

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
are groups like the Jans and the Parsi.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Like a lot of Americans don't think about,

29:24.000 --> 29:27.000
but there's some of the oldest, most distinct cultures in the world right now

29:27.000 --> 29:31.000
and they will almost certainly have collapsed in population by the end of the century

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
to the point where it'll be difficult for them to carry on their traditions.

29:34.000 --> 29:39.000
Coming back to that conversation about we get prosperous,

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
we give women education, they enter the job market

29:42.000 --> 29:46.000
and they have other things to do with their life.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
What's your proposal?

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
Presumably you're not saying that we need to rip women out of the workplace or education

29:51.000 --> 29:55.000
and if it is the case that we don't want people to be less prosperous

29:55.000 --> 29:59.000
and we also want to let people choose what they want to do,

29:59.000 --> 30:03.000
if this is what they want to do, if women don't want to have kids

30:03.000 --> 30:06.000
or if they don't feel like they're ready and they don't want to have kids until they are,

30:06.000 --> 30:09.000
they're concerned about the living cost and the cost of bringing a child into this world,

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
they're concerned about the environment, they're concerned about losing their life freedom

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
and struggling to find the right partner, whatever it is,

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
they've got better things to do with all of the money that they've just found.

30:18.000 --> 30:21.000
Why shouldn't they be allowed to do that?

30:21.000 --> 30:25.000
I think they should be allowed to do that and I think that real feminists today,

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
when I say a feminist, I mean somebody who wants gender,

30:28.000 --> 30:31.000
well I don't know if feminism is the right word, people who want gender equality,

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
whatever word you want to use for wanting gender equality

30:34.000 --> 30:38.000
in 100 years and 200 years to be an option, right?

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
You're sort of at the crux of history right now

30:41.000 --> 30:47.000
because no group that really has gender equality except for maybe Israel,

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
we can get to that later, there's questions there, whatever,

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
but it's anywhere close to above repopulation rate.

30:54.000 --> 30:59.000
So those groups and those cultural traditions are going to eventually disappear

30:59.000 --> 31:03.000
and what they will do is they will get better in the short term

31:03.000 --> 31:06.000
at taking the kids of people from these conservative traditions,

31:06.000 --> 31:10.000
but eventually, I mean just the way cultural evolution works,

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
the conservative traditions will build systems that have resistance

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
to whatever technique that they're using

31:15.000 --> 31:20.000
and they will not be able to repopulate that way anymore.

31:20.000 --> 31:25.000
So if you actually care about this, then you can join the grand experiment

31:25.000 --> 31:28.000
and the grand experiment is, and this is something we genuinely don't know yet,

31:28.000 --> 31:33.000
is it possible to have gender equality and a high fertility rate?

31:33.000 --> 31:36.000
My family, so like when I look at what my wife and I did,

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
I was asked to be on this podcast, Simone is in here,

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
not on my choice, I would have her on typically with me,

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
we write our books together, we run our companies together,

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
is one solution to the gender equality question,

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
which is to do everything together, write your books together,

31:49.000 --> 31:52.000
run your companies together, raise your kids together, right?

31:52.000 --> 31:56.000
But there are other solutions to this question that people can experiment with

31:56.000 --> 32:00.000
and what I love is this isn't a question of what's the most moral way to do things.

32:00.000 --> 32:04.000
Sort of the future will decide who was actually successful,

32:04.000 --> 32:08.000
who was able to have a lot of kids, motivate the continuation of the tradition

32:08.000 --> 32:11.000
through their children, you know, you get 18 years to pitch to your kids

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
that your way of living is a good way of living.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
And if your kids don't like that or they don't agree with that,

32:15.000 --> 32:20.000
I think we're blessed and that we live in a society where they can choose something else.

32:20.000 --> 32:24.000
And so, you know, I think that we are going to have a,

32:24.000 --> 32:29.000
hopefully a lot of people trying new ways of living,

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
new ways of trying to achieve gender equality, like my family,

32:32.000 --> 32:37.000
you know, doing everything with your spouse isn't the way that gender equality is typically envisioned

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
when people talk about it, but it is a form of gender equality.

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
Can liberalism last under demographic decline?

32:42.000 --> 32:45.000
Oh, no, no, it's gone. It's dead.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
I mean, if you talk conservative liberalism, maybe,

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
like if you're talking about like traditional liberalism,

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
if you're talking about the progressive movement,

32:51.000 --> 32:55.000
I often say it's a bit like if you get a certain blast of radiation, right,

32:55.000 --> 32:58.000
your DNA can be scrambled, your cells can no longer replicate.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
You don't know that you're a dead man walking yet,

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
you know, before you begin to feel the pain,

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
but there is nothing that can be done to save you at that point.

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
The fertility rate is so low as in that community,

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
there's really nothing that can be done.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
Even if you look at the genetic level right now,

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
it's so funny, you know, conservatives are often like,

33:13.000 --> 33:18.000
hey, you're on our team, why are you alerting them to the scope of the problem?

33:18.000 --> 33:21.000
You know, we win if we just sit back and let them disappear,

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
and it's like they're going to disappear no matter what.

33:23.000 --> 33:27.000
If you look at the hereditability of voting patterns,

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
which is around 30 to 50%, you know,

33:29.000 --> 33:32.000
whether this is done with identical twin studies and stuff,

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
this is not like fringe science, you can look up Geno politics on Wikipedia,

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
it's like mainstream.

33:36.000 --> 33:41.000
And you look at current fertility rates in countries like the U.S.,

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
we should expect about a one standard deviation shift

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
conservative in voting patterns over the next century.

33:46.000 --> 33:50.000
In the next 10 or 20 years, we'll see a massive shift to the left

33:50.000 --> 33:54.000
because as family units get atomized,

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
people vote more progressively.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
When people don't have kids, they vote more progressively.

33:58.000 --> 34:02.000
But after that, you're going to see a massive shift in the other direction,

34:02.000 --> 34:05.000
and it's just inevitable from the statistics at this point.

34:05.000 --> 34:09.000
Has any country tried to fix this problem through authoritarianism,

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
and how does that work?

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
A lot have, it just doesn't.

34:13.000 --> 34:17.000
So Romania fit, what is it? Order 7707 or something?

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
I don't know, maybe I'm getting a confused with Star Wars orders.

34:20.000 --> 34:24.000
But they decided under the communist period that they were going to ban abortion.

34:24.000 --> 34:27.000
And they thought, oh, this will be great.

34:27.000 --> 34:31.000
It'll shoot up fertility rates, and it did for a very brief period of time,

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
like two years or something like that.

34:33.000 --> 34:37.000
Then people found ways around it, and then after the law was repealed,

34:37.000 --> 34:42.000
fertility rates crashed because fertility or having kids became associated

34:42.000 --> 34:49.000
with really poverty often or low social status.

34:49.000 --> 34:54.000
And so you can look at countries like Iran that have been trying to implement things.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
It's really funny, I watched what China is implementing right now,

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
and it's like, Iran tried all of this 10 years ago.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
You guys can just look at what happened.

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
You're going to have to get really aggressive if you actually want to solve this,

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
and that's where I get really scared.

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
Because a lot of countries, what we have found is that you can,

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
dictatorially, people have tried to ban abortions,

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
feel like what's happening in China now,

35:14.000 --> 35:22.000
likely shutting down access to vasectomy clinics and stuff like that.

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
So countries can ban these things,

35:25.000 --> 35:29.000
and then it doesn't work because it doesn't work.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
So then what did they do?

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Then you get real handmaid's tale, and that gets scary for me.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
It was actually the peace on us in the Guardian,

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
and they were like, they had quoted me saying something like that,

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
and they go, well, that sounds like a threat.

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
And I'm like, do you have the mind of a child?

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
It's like when I tell a child, don't touch the stove,

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
you're going to burn your hands.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
They're like, that sounds like a threat.

35:47.000 --> 35:51.000
I'm trying to protect you here, but there's nothing I can do.

35:51.000 --> 35:54.000
At the end of the day, the Titanic's hitting the iceberg.

35:54.000 --> 35:59.000
I'm just trying to prepare for what's going to happen next.

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
But what happened next get really interesting.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
Sorry to keep talking.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
I don't want to.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
No, keep going.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
OK, so it's really cool here.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
If you look historically, so when I started caring about this,

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
I was in Korea, right?

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
95% population collapse.

36:11.000 --> 36:16.000
It was funny to think about because the memory is so strong there.

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
Less than a century ago, Japan coming over,

36:19.000 --> 36:23.000
murdering in Korea and China, millions of people,

36:23.000 --> 36:26.000
this conflict there, China, Korea, Japan, trying to,

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
well, less Korea trying to take over the other two,

36:28.000 --> 36:31.000
but mostly the other two trying to take over each other.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
There's a lot of history there.

36:33.000 --> 36:36.000
And it's so funny that now any one of them could just,

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
I'm like, how does Korea solve this?

36:37.000 --> 36:40.000
I guess they could import people from Japan or China.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
No, you can't because their populations are collapsing.

36:42.000 --> 36:47.000
Any one of them could non-violently just walk into their neighbor

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
100 years from now.

36:48.000 --> 36:51.000
They were able to motivate their citizens to kill people,

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
but they're not able to motivate them to have kids.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
And this is what's so interesting.

36:55.000 --> 36:58.000
It changes the game, but in a really beautiful way.

36:58.000 --> 37:02.000
You look at people like Putin who don't get the new world yet, right?

37:02.000 --> 37:05.000
The world used to be, you keep out immigrants,

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
you maintain cultural integrity,

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
and when you want to spread your culture, you go to other countries,

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
you kill their people, you subjugate them,

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
and you force them to convert to your culture.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
But that's not the game anymore.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
So you look at Russia, which has a desperately low fertility rate,

37:17.000 --> 37:21.000
attacking their costless cultural and like ethnic neighbors,

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
the Ukraine, who also had the desperately low fertility rate,

37:24.000 --> 37:27.000
both killing like an entire generation here.

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
And they're never going to recover from this.

37:30.000 --> 37:35.000
It is not the game anymore, the game that they're still playing.

37:35.000 --> 37:39.000
You win now, not through war, but with love.

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
And I say love and not just sex or spamming kids,

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
because if you spam kids,

37:43.000 --> 37:46.000
they're going to breed like caged panda bears like everyone else.

37:46.000 --> 37:50.000
They're going to not have any dedication to whatever weird thing about your culture

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
caused you to have a lot of kids,

37:52.000 --> 37:55.000
and they're just going to drift off into this monoculture and disappear.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
So what you need to do is you need to have a lot of kids,

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
but you also need to do a great job raising them,

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
make them proud of your cultural group,

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
make them want to continue that cultural group,

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
and those are the people who are going to be around in the future.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
And I'm really excited about that,

38:09.000 --> 38:13.000
because that is so much better than the old system of murdering people.

38:14.000 --> 38:18.000
Can you try and explain or illustrate

38:18.000 --> 38:23.000
what a world in deep population decline would be like?

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
Yeah.

38:24.000 --> 38:27.000
So the first thing, and I often don't talk about, you know,

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
the first thing is all economies are going to collapse.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
Pretty much the Western economy.

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
So our economic system is sort of a pyramid scheme.

38:35.000 --> 38:38.000
A lot of people know this, but let's just spill it out.

38:38.000 --> 38:42.000
If you look historically, people go, is this truism?

38:42.000 --> 38:46.000
If I put money on this stock market, that money grows on average.

38:46.000 --> 38:49.000
That has been happening because of two things.

38:49.000 --> 38:52.000
The number of workers has been growing exponentially,

38:52.000 --> 38:56.000
and the productivity per worker has been growing around linearly,

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
a little exponentially, but mostly linearly.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Yes, technology has been growing exponentially,

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
but the productivity per worker is about linear,

39:02.000 --> 39:05.000
or at least not close to the explosion worker population.

39:05.000 --> 39:08.000
That is why the economy has always been growing.

39:08.000 --> 39:11.000
If the worker population in the developed world

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
begins to collapse exponentially, people are like,

39:13.000 --> 39:17.000
well, why don't people in desperately poor countries count?

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
Because by definition, they have small economies.

39:19.000 --> 39:22.000
That's why they're poor, because their economies are small.

39:22.000 --> 39:26.000
So you don't need to wait for the world's population to begin to collapse

39:26.000 --> 39:29.000
for all of the developed world's economies to begin to collapse.

39:29.000 --> 39:32.000
So you're going to begin to see the economy shrink on average.

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
It won't be like it is now where on average things go up.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
On average things go down.

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
When things go down on average, people react very differently.

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
You don't leave your money in the stock market anymore.

39:42.000 --> 39:46.000
You're going to have math withdrawals of money from the stock market.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
And then this begins to break a bunch of other systems.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
So you see things like Detroit.

39:50.000 --> 39:54.000
Okay, so why did Detroit ultimately end up having the problems it was having?

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
And there's a few reasons.

39:56.000 --> 40:01.000
One is our society uses this miraculous cheat code called debt.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
Now, I'm a private equity VC guy.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
I'm very familiar with debt.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
So let's just talk a little bit about how debt works

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
and why it's such a miracle.

40:08.000 --> 40:13.000
If I'm making a $10 investment in $8 of that into debt and $2 of equity

40:13.000 --> 40:18.000
and that investment grows to just $12, my equity in that investment has doubled.

40:18.000 --> 40:23.000
But if it shrinks just $1, my equity has halved.

40:23.000 --> 40:27.000
We leveraged our land, our businesses.

40:27.000 --> 40:32.000
Leveraged means took out debt against our cities, our states, our nations.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
It's not people looking like the national debt.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
No, no, no, no.

40:35.000 --> 40:39.000
It's leveraged to the hilt all the way down.

40:39.000 --> 40:45.000
If things start shrinking, the whole thing falls apart.

40:45.000 --> 40:50.000
And yes, national debt is a little different than personal debt and stuff like that.

40:50.000 --> 40:54.000
But what you are beginning to see is essentially what we saw in Detroit.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
So people are like, oh, my house will be worth less.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
That's great.

40:57.000 --> 41:00.000
Yeah, it's great if houses go down 20%, maybe 50%.

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
But when people know a house is always going to decrease in price,

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
it decreases to a dollar.

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
And when a house is a dollar, like what you saw in Detroit,

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
when a house is a dollar, there's no reason to maintain it

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
because houses cost a lot to maintain.

41:11.000 --> 41:14.000
As anyone who is a homeowner knows, you put so much money into your house.

41:14.000 --> 41:18.000
But you justify it because, OK, well, it's an asset that I own

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
and people stop investing in assets that way.

41:20.000 --> 41:23.000
So the whole way we relate to money and the economy is going to change.

41:23.000 --> 41:27.000
So endless urban blight, economy is not functioning the way that they're supposed to function.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
So then what happens?

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
Well, where do people begin to invest?

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
One is what happens in a negative scenario?

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
So negative scenario, and this is what I'm terrified of,

41:35.000 --> 41:40.000
is the developed world finds a cheat code, which is immigrants.

41:40.000 --> 41:44.000
What they realize is that they can cheese their collapsing population

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
through mass immigration.

41:46.000 --> 41:51.000
But this cheat code only works if they keep really the only collection

41:51.000 --> 41:54.000
of countries that has an above repopulation rate right now,

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
which is mostly in Africa, desperately poor.

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
So now you have an economic incentive, a gun to the head

41:59.000 --> 42:04.000
of the entire developed world that Africa must stay in desperate poverty.

42:04.000 --> 42:08.000
Oh, you use Africa almost like a breeding ground

42:08.000 --> 42:12.000
to create the future population to be pulled across into other countries.

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
Yeah, it's sick, but that seems to be like when I talk to them,

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
that's like actually the going plan right now.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
But I don't think it's going to work.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
I don't think that that plan is going to work so we can ignore it.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
So what really happens?

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
Well, because their economies are going to collapse

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
before they can do that sort of mass.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
Right now you're getting a lot of immigrants,

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
but it's immigrants who want to leave.

42:30.000 --> 42:33.000
And I think what a lot of people forget is a lot of people don't want to leave.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
Even when Ireland was suffering the potato famine,

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
what a lot of people don't know is that the landlords,

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
there was a rash of landlord murders at the time.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
And so they got scared.

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
And so they would sometimes, I don't know how frequently,

42:45.000 --> 42:49.000
offer to pay for all of their tenants to go to America on coffinships.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
It was horrible, but at least it was the idea.

42:51.000 --> 42:55.000
That's the way I think many people would be imported these days, right?

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
So a horrible immigration, but at least, you know,

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
they had the option to leave during the potato famine during this time

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
when people would walk into town and they saw everyone was dead

43:04.000 --> 43:07.000
and then the corpses would start animating and they realized that they were just starting.

43:07.000 --> 43:11.000
Like it was bad, but the majority, a lot of people wanted to stay.

43:11.000 --> 43:14.000
And so I think what they're going to realize is that this,

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
this trickle of immigrants that we have right now,

43:16.000 --> 43:20.000
it's pretty close to the max trickle of immigrants you can get.

43:20.000 --> 43:23.000
And it's only just offsetting population collapse right now.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
And when they get to the US, when they get to Europe,

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
their fertility rate collapsed.

43:26.000 --> 43:30.000
First generation immigrants in the US only have a fertility rate of 1.7,

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
well below repopulation rate.

43:31.000 --> 43:34.000
So it's not like you could just bring immigrants and they solve the problem.

43:34.000 --> 43:35.000
You need to keep importing people.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
But anyway, okay.

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
Ignore all this.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
Okay.

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
So world's collapsing.

43:40.000 --> 43:41.000
Where do you put your money?

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
If on average, the economy is collapsing.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
This is where it gets cool because we get something we haven't had in a long time.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
Individual human lives start to matter.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Individual human cultures start to matter.

43:50.000 --> 43:54.000
If you have a cultural group that has a high fertility rate and is technophilic,

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
like they engage with technology.

43:56.000 --> 43:59.000
And even if they're technophobic, but less of their technophobic,

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
that becomes a group you want to invest in.

44:01.000 --> 44:06.000
That becomes a place you want to place money because that's the only place

44:06.000 --> 44:10.000
that you can be fairly sure is going to grow in aggregate in the future.

44:10.000 --> 44:15.000
And that creates a totally different world economy than the one we have now.

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
And it's a very interesting world economy.

44:17.000 --> 44:21.000
And so when people say like, what actually is our foundation sort of doing?

44:21.000 --> 44:25.000
Really, what we're doing is we're trying to identify those groups right now

44:25.000 --> 44:29.000
and build connections between them so that we can have a pluralistic group

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
of thriving economies of the willing.

44:31.000 --> 44:34.000
And of the willing, what I mean is the people who were willing to have kids,

44:34.000 --> 44:38.000
willing to give those kids a good enough life that they wanted to stay in that culture.

44:38.000 --> 44:44.000
Since learning about the current trends of population collapse, declining birth rates, etc.

44:44.000 --> 44:47.000
I've started to view a lot of the problems that we're facing,

44:47.000 --> 44:53.000
especially the cultural ways that people see dating, family life, having kids,

44:53.000 --> 44:58.000
relationships with their parents, the future of the world through a very different lens.

44:58.000 --> 45:03.000
And there's a trend at the moment that's only recently, like within the last couple of months,

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
I've started seeing come out on the internet,

45:05.000 --> 45:11.000
which is one of men in their 20s getting vasectomies as a protest against feminists

45:11.000 --> 45:14.000
that want to be able to have free and easy sex.

45:14.000 --> 45:18.000
It's literally like a clap back where you've got the pill, I'm going to get the snip.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
Have you seen this?

45:20.000 --> 45:25.000
I'm a fan. I mean, I focus more on the trans maxing movement. Have you heard of that?

45:25.000 --> 45:26.000
No, what's trans maxing?

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
Oh, it's fascinating.

45:28.000 --> 45:33.000
So it's a group of guys who are not like traditional transit that they don't have gender dysphoria.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
They don't feel like they were born the wrong gender.

45:35.000 --> 45:39.000
They're just like, as a guy and as a not particularly attractive or not particularly wealthy guy,

45:39.000 --> 45:44.000
I got dealt a bad hand. Hormone therapy is easy to get access to these days.

45:44.000 --> 45:48.000
I'm going to become a woman. And that's what it is.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
With what goal? What's the goal of it?

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
The goal is to get an easier life.

45:52.000 --> 45:56.000
I mean, if you've been consuming a fire hose of red pill and migtail content,

45:56.000 --> 46:00.000
you know, it can sound like a pretty good idea to a lot of people, I think.

46:00.000 --> 46:03.000
Oh, because women have got it so much easier than men do.

46:03.000 --> 46:07.000
Therefore, if I become the closest thing that I can to a woman, it's going to fix all of my problem.

46:07.000 --> 46:16.000
Okay, fair enough. I mean, yeah, that that is an approach and the optional elected vasectomy in your 20s thing.

46:16.000 --> 46:22.000
I think sort of sit on the shelf next to each other for I wouldn't have predicted this on my 2023 bingo card.

46:22.000 --> 46:28.000
But yeah, so just everything that I see, you know, this stophavingkids.org who you may be familiar with,

46:28.000 --> 46:31.000
like this really serious anti-nateless movement.

46:31.000 --> 46:35.000
Have you heard of the involuntary anti-nateless movement?

46:35.000 --> 46:38.000
They want to they want to sterilize the entire population.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
They're like terrorists. They're just scary people.

46:40.000 --> 46:44.000
Wow. And what's the justification for this? I'm going to guess climate.

46:44.000 --> 46:47.000
Oh, no. So they're really just negative utilitarians.

46:47.000 --> 46:53.000
I think most anti-natalism and for people who aren't familiar with negative utilitarianism,

46:53.000 --> 46:59.000
it's the belief that negative emotions are bad but positive emotions aren't inherently good

46:59.000 --> 47:05.000
or that a human life, a negative emotions are more acute than positive emotions.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
Are they just much higher in volume?

47:07.000 --> 47:10.000
The best the best the best example of this that I learned from a friend was

47:10.000 --> 47:15.000
imagine that you got to spend the rest of your life in the optimal amount of bliss,

47:15.000 --> 47:19.000
maxing out your pleasure, compare this to an existence where for the remainder of your life,

47:19.000 --> 47:24.000
you were spent in maximum torture with as much pain as you can imagine.

47:24.000 --> 47:27.000
Or let's say that you did one and then did the other would one be worth the other

47:27.000 --> 47:32.000
and most people have an inclination that suffering is somehow worse than pain that you are in

47:32.000 --> 47:40.000
and then you net out after a human life, what was the group that involuntary anti-natalists

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
because of negative utilitarians?

47:42.000 --> 47:43.000
Yeah.

47:43.000 --> 47:47.000
They basically say that a human life is net suffering overall.

47:47.000 --> 47:52.000
Therefore, it is morally reprehensible to bring any future life into this world

47:52.000 --> 47:57.000
because the net experience is one of pain and torment and displeasure.

47:57.000 --> 47:58.000
Yeah.

47:58.000 --> 48:04.000
And I actually suspect that when we see this urban monoculture I've described begin to really dwindle in size

48:04.000 --> 48:07.000
and the only people who are left are the most extremist was in it.

48:07.000 --> 48:11.000
We're going to begin to have to deal with terrorists on that front and that really scares me.

48:11.000 --> 48:15.000
But here's the thing, who's to know we aren't already dealing with terrorists on that front?

48:15.000 --> 48:18.000
Look at declining fertility rates around the world today.

48:18.000 --> 48:21.000
Biological fertility, declining sperm counts, declining testosterone.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
Who's to say there isn't something in the water?

48:23.000 --> 48:24.000
You know what I mean?

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
Do you think that someone's purposefully doing this?

48:26.000 --> 48:27.000
I don't know, man.

48:27.000 --> 48:31.000
I would hazard toward Hanlon's razor with stuff like this.

48:31.000 --> 48:32.000
Yeah.

48:32.000 --> 48:41.000
The incentives align for people to believe that they're doing something which is sympathetic, empathetic,

48:41.000 --> 48:45.000
caring, whether it be because of the environment, whether it be...

48:46.000 --> 48:50.000
The environmental thing is such an interesting argument to me

48:50.000 --> 48:56.000
because if you think that a planet that has too many people on it is bad for the planet,

48:56.000 --> 49:00.000
wait until you see what a planet that has too few people on it is like.

49:00.000 --> 49:03.000
Oh, well, we existed 200 years ago.

49:03.000 --> 49:06.000
There was only half a billion people or a billion people or whatever on the planet.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
The planet's been fine with this many people on before.

49:08.000 --> 49:11.000
It's like, yeah, but what's the experience of the life like for the people that are on it?

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
What about all of the animals that you want to save?

49:13.000 --> 49:17.000
What about all of the interjections that you want to make with regards to controlling the climate

49:17.000 --> 49:21.000
to ensuring that all of the different ecosystems that you care about continue?

49:21.000 --> 49:25.000
So I've had a lot of pushback about talking about declining birth rates

49:25.000 --> 49:30.000
and whatever you want to say, like dating sphere adjacent sometimes.

49:30.000 --> 49:34.000
Although I'm speaking to the researchers, I'm not doing a panel show with a bunch of different people

49:34.000 --> 49:39.000
screaming at them saying that they're going to become loveless harpies in their 30s.

49:40.000 --> 49:47.000
I feel like the criticisms that people have about anybody that brings up declining birth rates

49:47.000 --> 49:50.000
either haven't thought about the problem sufficiently well

49:50.000 --> 49:53.000
or have a really, really perverse and malicious incentive

49:53.000 --> 49:58.000
because anybody that sees a discussion about declining birth rates

49:58.000 --> 50:02.000
is anything other than a concern for the future of human lives that haven't yet existed.

50:02.000 --> 50:05.000
They're just not philosophically sophisticated.

50:05.000 --> 50:09.000
Yeah, I'm totally open. I'm totally open to having the discussion

50:09.000 --> 50:15.000
that maybe there is an optimal amount of population that would be great to have on the Earth.

50:15.000 --> 50:20.000
I think the carrying capacity of the planet is significantly higher than where we're at at the moment.

50:20.000 --> 50:24.000
And I think that climate mastery and all the rest of it we have a ton of work to do

50:24.000 --> 50:28.000
for a whole host of things, whether that be AI alignment, whether that be grey goo from nanotechnology

50:28.000 --> 50:31.000
but like pick your existential risk of choice, right?

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
But like fuck off, bro.

50:34.000 --> 50:40.000
If you think that I'm not going to talk about the most existential of existential risks individually to you

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
and here's the other thing.

50:42.000 --> 50:45.000
So folding this in, a lot of people will have listened to the Steven Shaw episode that I did

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
which was absolutely fantastic.

50:47.000 --> 50:50.000
I really love him as a demographer and a researcher in this world.

50:50.000 --> 50:55.000
And the novel, an interesting insight, the really novel interesting insight

50:55.000 --> 51:00.000
that I'm going to kind of add into my worldview with regards to this that I've learned from you today

51:00.000 --> 51:06.000
is looking at what happens when you roll the clock forward over a longer timeline

51:06.000 --> 51:10.000
with which groups are going to continue to survive and which cultures are going to continue to survive.

51:10.000 --> 51:20.000
If it's the case that you say that you care about a particular movement continuing to be pushed through the ages

51:20.000 --> 51:25.000
because this is something that we should care about, let's say it's reducing the amount of people that are on the planet

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
to restrict climate change.

51:27.000 --> 51:30.000
Let's just say that it's climate change overall, right?

51:30.000 --> 51:36.000
If you have, given the fact that political leaning is 50% heritable,

51:36.000 --> 51:42.000
if you don't have any children, who do you think is going to continue that particular philosophy that you've got?

51:42.000 --> 51:46.000
Like you are literally making your ideology a dying breed.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
No, I couldn't agree more.

51:50.000 --> 51:55.000
And I think one of the things that I always think, you know, when you're talking about biodiversity and stuff like this,

51:55.000 --> 51:58.000
I always wondered, like, do these people not think into the future?

51:58.000 --> 52:03.000
Right now, from what we know about our planet, humans are the only species that can seed a new biome.

52:03.000 --> 52:06.000
We are the only species that can get off planet, right?

52:06.000 --> 52:11.000
So if we seed a new biome in a million and 10 million years, it'll be just as rich as our own.

52:11.000 --> 52:15.000
We could seed thousands, hundreds of thousands of new biomes.

52:15.000 --> 52:20.000
If humanity doesn't win through this eye of the needle we're about to go through,

52:20.000 --> 52:24.000
if humanity does die off, well, I mean, everything we know about physics today

52:24.000 --> 52:27.000
says the sun will eventually expand and all life will go extinct.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
It's in game.

52:29.000 --> 52:38.000
You know, if you care about biodiversity in the long run, humans are critical to maximizing that.

52:38.000 --> 52:41.000
Although I will modify one thing you said.

52:41.000 --> 52:46.000
I think that there is a logical argument for negative utilitarianism.

52:46.000 --> 52:50.000
I think there's a logical argument for getting rid of humans.

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
I don't agree with it.

52:52.000 --> 53:00.000
These people are against my cultural group, but I don't think that they're just, like, completely insane either.

53:00.000 --> 53:05.000
Do you think it's a moral obligation to have children, then, with all of this sort of folded together?

53:05.000 --> 53:10.000
I think different people have different moral frameworks they're optimizing for.

53:10.000 --> 53:15.000
I think if somebody believes that their moral framework should continue to exist into the future,

53:15.000 --> 53:18.000
200, 300 years into the future, like gender equality or something like that,

53:18.000 --> 53:21.000
and you don't have kids, you have morally failed.

53:21.000 --> 53:27.000
If you, however, are just like, no, it doesn't matter if my belief system dies out with me,

53:27.000 --> 53:32.000
then whatever, you know, I'm not going to tell you that your morals are wrong

53:32.000 --> 53:37.000
because I think that morality is one of those things where I believe that my morals are right,

53:37.000 --> 53:41.000
if I go around trying to police everyone else's morality, I'm just going to have a bad time.

53:41.000 --> 53:47.000
So that line in the sand is one I've been really interested in playing about with.

53:47.000 --> 53:56.000
I absolutely agree that some sort of handmade tale future where women are kept in pens like cows

53:56.000 --> 53:59.000
so that they can keep the future of the population going is wrong.

53:59.000 --> 54:06.000
Also, telling women that the only way that you can live a fulfilling life is by doing some domestic version of that.

54:06.000 --> 54:12.000
Also is wrong, but I can't see why there isn't any sympathy out there in the world

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
for the reverse of this situation.

54:14.000 --> 54:19.000
What about all of the people who were told you don't need to have kids to have a fulfilling life

54:19.000 --> 54:23.000
that did want to become mothers that had their preferences nudged in the opposite direction,

54:23.000 --> 54:26.000
break through the fertility window and then grieve for families that they never had,

54:26.000 --> 54:30.000
that where is the finger pointing going in the other direction?

54:30.000 --> 54:36.000
Because I don't see anybody unironically saying that women need to get out of the boardroom

54:36.000 --> 54:39.000
and get back in the bedroom to start producing more children.

54:39.000 --> 54:47.000
I think that they're just saying, look, maybe you should think about the current cultural norms that are being pushed

54:47.000 --> 54:50.000
and take them with a big spoonful of salt.

54:50.000 --> 54:53.000
Yeah, and I think that a lot of statistics women just aren't familiar with.

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
Things that made my wife feel a lot more comfortable if you look at studies.

54:56.000 --> 54:59.000
Not all studies show this, but a number of them do.

54:59.000 --> 55:02.000
Is that parent households with two working parents,

55:02.000 --> 55:07.000
the kids actually perform better academically and have better emotional health than parents with stay at home.

55:07.000 --> 55:08.000
It's a small effect.

55:08.000 --> 55:14.000
But what I'm saying is, is that I think that there's this intuition that only the traditional way of doing things is correct.

55:14.000 --> 55:21.000
And that the truth is, is what is correct is whatever ends up working in the long term for human civilization,

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
because nothing is really working right now.

55:23.000 --> 55:28.000
And so I just encourage people to, if they think I can't be a mom and in the boardroom,

55:28.000 --> 55:31.000
I would encourage you to rethink the way you're structuring your family,

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
rethink the way you're structuring finding a partner.

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
You know, earlier we were talking about dating markets,

55:35.000 --> 55:42.000
and one of the things that our foundation is doing is we're working to try to create and promote new types of dating apps,

55:42.000 --> 55:46.000
maybe even recreate the London season, you know, something like that,

55:46.000 --> 55:51.000
but the travels between places like the Olympics where you have, you know, a bunch of the single people go,

55:51.000 --> 55:56.000
but there's some rules that make it harder to just have a really low switching cost between partners,

55:56.000 --> 55:59.000
which is one of the big problems that we're dealing with right now.

55:59.000 --> 56:03.000
So it was a lot of this is about experimenting with new social technologies

56:03.000 --> 56:06.000
and understanding that there probably are ways to have it all,

56:06.000 --> 56:13.000
much more than I think people want to accept because it requires trying new things and being called a freak by other people.

56:13.000 --> 56:17.000
What about people that say it's too expensive to bring a child into this world?

56:17.000 --> 56:20.000
Why? Why are poorer people having more kids?

56:20.000 --> 56:26.000
If it's an issue of cost, then what you should see is a line where people have more kids,

56:26.000 --> 56:30.000
the more money they have, but typically the line goes in the other direction within and between countries

56:30.000 --> 56:34.000
until you get to like ludicrous levels of wealth, like half a million dollars a year.

56:34.000 --> 56:37.000
So what I'd say is it's enormously expensive.

56:37.000 --> 56:40.000
It is a massive lifestyle sacrifice.

56:40.000 --> 56:45.000
It absolutely is a lifestyle sacrifice, but is it too expensive?

56:45.000 --> 56:46.000
I think that's the real thing.

56:46.000 --> 56:49.000
Is it too expensive? Is it that you can't afford it?

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
Or is it that you would need to like us?

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
We had to leave a city. We moved to a rural area.

56:53.000 --> 56:56.000
We changed the type of jobs we could get because of that.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
We made a lot of sacrifices to do this.

56:58.000 --> 57:03.000
And I understand that for families in less socially economically advantaged positions,

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
they have to make even more sacrifices.

57:05.000 --> 57:10.000
But when a family decides they want a lot of kids, they do it.

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
And I think in addition to that, this is another area.

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
One of the projects that we worked in was Project Eureka,

57:14.000 --> 57:17.000
which was a town for like single moms that had kids

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
and other people who had kids and who wanted to co-raise kids

57:19.000 --> 57:22.000
because there are social technologies we can try.

57:22.000 --> 57:27.000
And I would really like to see these commune systems and stuff like that begin to pop up more

57:27.000 --> 57:33.000
because I think as an investment prospect, they are a really good long-term investment prospect

57:33.000 --> 57:36.000
if you look at the model that I was talking about earlier.

57:36.000 --> 57:40.000
The challenges of...

57:40.000 --> 57:43.000
The reason that people say it's too expensive to bring a child into this world,

57:43.000 --> 57:47.000
I don't think that they're talking about the cost on their finances.

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
I think they're talking about the cost on their freedom.

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
Oh, yeah.

57:51.000 --> 57:57.000
If you look at the reasons that are given for a lot of non-daters at the moment

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
for people that are checking out of the dating market,

57:59.000 --> 58:04.000
it's just got better things to do, not wanting to lose personal freedom.

58:04.000 --> 58:07.000
There's this huge, huge study that was done by Pew.

58:07.000 --> 58:10.000
And it just came back that people were just distracted.

58:10.000 --> 58:15.000
So what it seems is that if you are more financially enabled,

58:15.000 --> 58:19.000
there are more things that you can do with your finances,

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
which means that you can go abroad to Bali.

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
Why not go to Bali for two weeks?

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
Well, if you have the kid, you can't go to Bali for two weeks.

58:25.000 --> 58:28.000
The girl with the list thing, which you must have seen that came off TikTok,

58:28.000 --> 58:31.000
a girl printed out 350 reasons not to have a child

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
and then printed them all on a piece of paper.

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
The reasons ranged from stuff like,

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
a child is literally a parasite inside of you

58:37.000 --> 58:40.000
who can't wear my cute high heels anymore,

58:40.000 --> 58:43.000
can't do brunch on Sundays.

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
Yeah. So I want to get into this. I'm really excited.

58:45.000 --> 58:49.000
So there are, I think, two core reasons that people don't have kids

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
within the category that you're talking about here.

58:51.000 --> 58:54.000
It's because they're optimizing for their personal happiness.

58:54.000 --> 58:57.000
Now, this can be broad satisfaction, contentment, whatever word you want to use,

58:57.000 --> 59:00.000
but it's some sort of emotional optimization

59:00.000 --> 59:04.000
or they're optimizing for their own position within a local status hierarchy.

59:04.000 --> 59:08.000
This can be showing off to people on Twitter or whatever, you know,

59:08.000 --> 59:11.000
the trips that you're doing or the things that you're doing with your life

59:11.000 --> 59:16.000
because you think that these make you, you know, like better or higher within some group.

59:16.000 --> 59:20.000
As soon as you're not optimizing for one of those two things,

59:20.000 --> 59:25.000
typically having kids, or I suppose you could say that I'm trying to make the world a better place

59:25.000 --> 59:31.000
along some sort of framework like donating to like protecting ecology or something like that.

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
A lot of that loops back to status though.

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
Yeah, a lot of that loops back to status.

59:35.000 --> 59:38.000
So I think what we're going to see, and this is really cool

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
because it's going to change what it means to be human.

59:40.000 --> 59:44.000
When people, I mean, even more than the other options people have right now,

59:44.000 --> 59:48.000
when Robosexuality, I always go back to the Futureama episode about this,

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
that predicted this, when people can start dating AIs

59:50.000 --> 59:53.000
and you can have your deep fake girlfriend and stuff like that,

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
and then eventually people will be able to go into pods

59:55.000 --> 59:58.000
and live any virtual reality lifestyle they want.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
When these sorts of things become possible,

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.000
and they likely will within my grandkids' lifetime at least, if not our own,

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:09.000
pretty much everyone who's optimizing for status or personal pleasure

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
is going to be cold from the gene pool.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:16.000
And any cultural group that can't motivate people to optimize for something else

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
is going to be removed from the system,

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000
and that is going to fundamentally change what it means to be human,

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:26.000
and likely have a pretty big impact on sort of the human sociological profile

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
in terms of the genetic screening that's going to cause.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.000
It's going to nudge the genetic disposition

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:38.000
because the only cohorts that are left are going to have a particular type of predisposition.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
And over time that's going to, right?

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Yeah, that's really, really interesting.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Because, you know, we all have this balance between

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000
hedonic pleasure and meaning that we seek in the future.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
You know, most parents, I don't think,

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000
if you were to test them on a minute-by-minute basis,

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.000
it's not the most pleasurable thing in the world to raise a child,

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
and I'm looking at some of the studies that I've seen.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.000
It's not massively pleasurable, but it's incredibly meaningful.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000
And, you know, there has to be some sort of a spectrum

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:10.000
where on one side someone lives for a life that in retrospect they're glad they're lived,

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.000
and on the other side someone lives a life that moment to moment they're happy that they're living.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
And, you know, that spectrum between the two,

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.000
am I living for a future that's meaning, or am I living for a now that's pleasure?

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Yeah, I'm so excited.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Well, I love what you're getting at here,

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
which is how do you balance these two?

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000
And the really cool thing is that biologically,

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000
we're already optimized to have kids.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.000
And I think a lot of the unhappiness that comes in society today

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:41.000
is that people forget that all of your ancestors had kids.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
They had sex, and they had kids.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
They're almost all of them dead, right?

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:50.000
And so humans are programmed to find genuine contentment and happiness

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:55.000
of a deeper kind and a more meaningful kind than they can get from almost anything else

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:00.000
from continuing down the path that had led to our species being successful so far.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
And I think when you look at a lot of influencers right now,

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.000
if you look at a lot of unhappiness, they are showing people

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:12.000
what people are sort of biologically optimized for right after they go through puberty

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:17.000
without people realizing that that optimization program changes as you get older.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Often there's a joke that I got in trouble for on Twitter,

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
which is to say that I don't know if you know Blippi.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.000
He's like a blues clue sort of character who dances around around fire trucks for kids

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000
and is like, yeah, I'm driving a fire truck.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
I'm playing in a dump truck.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
I'm playing on the playground, you know, and kids are like,

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000
all this is the perfect life before they go through puberty.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000
They see this. That's what they're optimized for.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
They're optimized for play and exploration.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.000
As an adult, you see this and you're like, oh my God, his life looks terrible.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
I mean, obviously he probably makes a lot of money,

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
but I mean, you wouldn't actually want to live that way.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:52.000
And I often argue that Andrew Tate is sort of the Blippi for teenagers.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.000
This is what a teenage boy thinks is the ideal adult life.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:01.000
But to an actual grown man, you see this and you can see sort of the deadness

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:05.000
within his eyes and he's like, yeah, I have to please multiple women a day

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.000
or they'll leave me and then I won't be able to maintain sort of the thing that I built up.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.000
And I'm like, oh my God, I can't even imagine having to just have a routine

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.000
of constantly having sex every day so that I can at a base level

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
maintain my economic empire.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.000
But to a young boy, this sounds, oh, that's the best

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.000
because humans go through a second puberty when they have kids.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Your testosterone drops dramatically.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000
You begin to gain happiness from different sources

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
and it's a deeper kind of happiness.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
And with young women, it's the same thing.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000
With young women, they get told, oh, you're going to love traveling the world.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
You're going to love a certain point.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Love just becomes drawl, you know, because you were biologically programmed

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:49.000
to want to know not everyone is, you know, people's biological programming is a bit different.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.000
You know, I could say that on average, human males are biologically programmed

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
to find human females attractive.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000
But obviously not all human males find human females attractive.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
So a few people don't go through this shift later in life.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000
But when you optimize around the things that give you happiness,

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.000
when you were a teenager and your whole society tells you to optimize around those things,

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.000
you hit middle age and you're like, why doesn't anything really make me happy anymore?

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Why aren't video games making me happy anymore?

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Why aren't the things I used to do?

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Why does these status games not make me happy anymore?

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:24.000
And it's because your culture used to tell you, hey, you need to move on to your next stage of life,

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000
but you don't have that culture anymore because you're in this bubble.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Going back to what you said about status and how status provides a incentive

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:43.000
for people to behave in particular ways, ways that allow them to advertise their fancy trip to Bali

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.000
and brunch and whatever on a Sunday on social media.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Have you considered a way of reprogramming statusful activities so that motherhood becomes pedestalized again?

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:02.000
I hate to say this, but I think for most of the population, people are like, oh, why don't you force them to?

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:06.000
I talk with some people and they're like, what about like banning porn or banning, you know, whatever, right?

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Like would that force people to do this?

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.000
And it's like, look, or banning social media, right?

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:18.000
The cultural groups and people who aren't resistant to the existing pressures in this world that are sterilizing them,

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000
unfortunately, they're just kind of a lost cause.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:26.000
What we need to do is we need to find the few groups that have found a way to make themselves resistant to this

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:32.000
and sort of nurture them so that they can survive through this period and then end up thriving,

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
which is why we focus on things like trying to...

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:39.000
It's not like humans are, well, it depends on your view of free will, I suppose,

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
but we're not exactly deterministic beings, right?

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:46.000
If we're able to nudge the culture in a way to get people to change their behavior, you know, people...

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
I had Peter Singer on the show yesterday.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Peter Singer managed to impact so many people's lives through animal liberation

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.000
that wouldn't have done that without him nudging them in that way.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.000
There is status that was associated with being vegan.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Therefore, people started doing it.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
They were also brought into this philosophy that underpinned it.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
I'm a club promoter by trade, right?

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
I ran nightclubs for my entire career.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:10.000
And with that, I understand the power of trends and mimesis.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:18.000
I'm just thinking, at the moment, there is a mimetic trend about, like, motherhoods' lame or dangerous or freedom restricting.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Changing that trend technology seems something that could be quite a high-leverage opportunity.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Delta, you changed your mind on this, and I'm remembering conversations,

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.000
because this is actually a debate I've had with my wife, and she's changed my mind before, but I forgot.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Which is, I think, well, she would argue, a core aspect of our advocacy, if we can,

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:44.000
is to get it modeled in television shows and in other types of popular media

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000
that having lots of kids is a high-status thing.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:53.000
The big fear I have is I'm just really afraid of people having kids because it helps their status.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:59.000
I would like it if it's like a yes and thing, but no matter what, when you make something a status thing,

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:05.000
there's going to be a group of kids that are brought into the world only because of the way they augment the parent's status.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:10.000
And that means that their parents are going to be narcissists, and they're going to be pretty...

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000
But you're right.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.000
I mean, hopefully we can move culture in a way that doesn't just target the narcissist.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.000
That's more holistic.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Yeah, so we're about to get on to talking about another third rail of your approach to sort of embryo screening and genetic selection and stuff.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:34.000
But do you see it almost like, for one of a better word, like a breeding experiment that we have,

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:39.000
not an experiment, but a breeding future that we have with humans,

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.000
where there are going to be particular cohorts that continue.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
There are going to be particular cohorts that don't,

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000
given that a good chunk of our behavior is determined by our genes.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:52.000
The type of people that continue to reproduce will have a particular genetic predisposition,

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:57.000
which means that we're going to nudge the entire human race's genetic predisposition in one direction.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Are we in the middle of a breeding experiment and are humans facing extinction?

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:07.000
I'd say it's a cultural experiment because the independent factor that's being changed is culture.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:12.000
And the dependent variable that we're measuring is their ability to have kids, so breed,

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000
but also maintain those kids within that social group.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:19.000
So if the kids just leave or they don't like their lifestyle as a child,

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.000
you can't just give a kid a terrible childhood or they're not going to continue that cultural group.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:29.000
And there has to be, this is actually a really interesting phenomenon here,

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:33.000
where if you look at countries that are poorer but also have really low fertility rates,

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:38.000
typically the common thing across those countries is that there is very low amounts of hope.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:43.000
This is why China has such a low fertility rate, because people was in China,

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.000
this is where the, we are the last generation meme comes from.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
They're like, what am I just having kids so the government can use them?

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Like there's no more like social mobility here or something like this.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.000
And I think it's why when you're looking at a cultural group like Jews and Israel,

01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:00.000
there's such a high fertility rate as there is a high level of cultural hope within that cultural group.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.000
They feel like when they have kids, they're not just, you know, grits for the grindstone.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:09.000
They can move up within the culture, even if they're in a low status position.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:14.000
So I would agree with everything you're saying, and I'm really excited for this experiment.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:25.000
I imagine that the discussions around climate are just another really pernicious sort of convincing factor

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
about why people shouldn't have kids.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Not only are you contributing to the burning of fossil fuels,

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.000
not only are you going to increase greenhouse gases, which are going to kill all of these other animals,

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:41.000
but the life that your child is going to have on this planet is also going to be filled with fumes and grey skies,

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
and it's going to be toxic and whatever.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:48.000
But this is, I was going to say, this is also just the latest apocalyptic cult in the US, you know,

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
and it's not going to be the last one, you know.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:58.000
We keep having, if the US is dotted by anything, it's dotted by sort of apocalypticism and fears.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.000
The US actually, Jewish and Christian traditions more generally are dotted by this.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
And I think the next one we're going to see is AI.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Why would you have kids when AI is going to kill us all?

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.000
You know, it's just a cycle and it keeps going.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.000
You do know that there's people watching this right now that is saying,

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000
well, what about you two?

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
You two are just saying that it's the birth rate decline apocalypse.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:20.000
You're the same Cassandra as that you're accusing everyone else of being.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Well, because I would say that I do argue that things are going to get worse,

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
but I don't argue they're going to kill us all.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:34.000
I think if you look at real climate change data, it says, which I believe the climate is going to get worse.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.000
A lot of suffering is going to happen because of it, but it's not going to kill us all.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.000
That climate message hasn't done as well as spreading as, you know,

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Greta Thornberg's and one of your recent podcasts is that everyone's going to be dead in five years due to the climate.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:50.000
AI is going to massively change what it means to be human.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:55.000
It could even cause some major catastrophes, but it's not going to turn us all into goo.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:02.000
And so I think that there is, it's right to say that we in the world have actual things to be afraid of.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:06.000
There's going to be actual systemic shifts, but I think that's different than just apocalypticism

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.000
and being like, we're all going to die. No need to think about the future.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
You know, Harold camping style, right?

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:16.000
OK, so the Millerist movement getting on to what you did with your children.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:20.000
We've discussed what the world should do, how we should move forward.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Some of the challenges, some of the reasons that people don't.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:28.000
What is the unique process that you went through with your wife?

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.000
So this is spicy.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:38.000
What we did is we did full genetic sequencing of our embryos and we use those genetic

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:42.000
sequencing to inform the order in which we implanted the embryos.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.000
So why did we do this?

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Well, you have to do biopsies of embryos anyways, often to determine if they're halfway

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
or not. Not everyone does this, but most people do.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
It's the normal thing you do when you're doing IVF.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:57.000
We had to do IVF anyway because my wife was unable to get pregnant naturally due to, you know,

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.000
having depression when she was younger, which caused her to develop anorexia,

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.000
which meant that she doesn't like mistreat naturally.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.000
And she actually was trans women.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:13.000
She often doesn't like competition to see who has to take more hormones to be a woman.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:18.000
And so, you know, she has to do all of this stuff to have kids.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.000
So I had to do IVF anyway.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.000
We had to do the biopsies anyway.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.000
And now with genetic screening data, we could go through that and her mom died

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.000
solely of cancer.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.000
And so we were able to look at that.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.000
And, you know, she suffered from major depressive disorder, which also has genetic

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.000
feelings.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.000
So we were able to look at these things and say, well, I mean, if we can choose to

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:39.000
lower the probability that our kids have to deal with these genetic conditions,

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000
like, would we lower that probability?

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Like, to me, people are like, yeah, but people will make fun of you on Twitter

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.000
if you do this.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:50.000
It's like, yeah, okay, my kid comes to me and they're like, dad, I really, you know,

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
want to kill myself right now or have migraines.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
That was another thing we selected against.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.000
You could have selected against this and you didn't because people were going to make

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000
fun of you on Twitter.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Like, and this is just our cultural group.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
So people try to connect this with eugenics.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.000
But eugenics, the definition of eugenics is very clear.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.000
It's the belief that there's good and bad genes and that the good genes should be distributed

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.000
maximally throughout society, which is sort of the antithesis of what we believe.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:19.000
We believe every family, every cultural unit has beliefs about good and bad genes, right?

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
Like our family doesn't want our kids to get cancer.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:27.000
But that reproductive choice should always be in the hands of individual families and

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.000
individual cultural groups and that it should never be enacted.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:34.000
If anything, I would say that it's eugenics for the government to come and tell my family

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:40.000
the genetic choices we should make because it views sort of pure, unaltered human DNA

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.000
as the superior form of humanity.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Like they're actually saying we need genetic purity in humanity and you're tainting the

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:51.000
genetic purity of the human species by like selecting things.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.000
I don't know.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:56.000
To me, that sounds much more eugenics than me being like, I don't want my kids to get cancer.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
And this is something many cultural groups have done over time.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Like Orthodox Jews have to do this with Tay Sacks.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Some black communities have to do this with sickle cell.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Like it's also like an anti-Semitic and racist position to call this sort of genetic

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:13.000
selection and this sort of reproductive choice eugenics.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:18.000
So I think that we do support and I think now here's the thing.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:23.000
That's the nice way to put all of this, but then let's go big or go home.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Let's be controversial here, right?

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.000
So what happens if we really hold this position in the future?

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Well, when we say our foundation's goal is to preserve and increase human diversity,

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:39.000
a lot of people miss the and increase human diversity part because as soon as families

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:44.000
have these choices, a lot of people think families are all going to choose the same thing.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.000
I love it.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:51.000
People are like, isn't everyone going to choose like a white buff child?

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
And it's like, no, no.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Like black families aren't going to choose like little Aryan kids or something.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
What are you out of your mind?

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Everyone's going to choose things that optimize for their cultural traditions value system.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:08.000
And we're entering into this grand experiment where some of those value systems will prove

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000
to be more efficacious than other value systems.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Right now people are like, oh, you could select for IQ.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:17.000
We didn't select for IQ, but you could theoretically select for IQ and we might do it in the future.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:22.000
But IQ is such a like a bad metric because we're in the early days of this technology.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Eventually IQ will be 80 different things.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Are you optimizing for creativity?

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Are you optimizing for in the same way?

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
You don't just optimize for strengths.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.000
You optimize for agility.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.000
You optimize for lean muscle.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.000
You optimize for like this type of muscle fiber versus this type of muscle fiber.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:47.000
And we will see this blossoming, I hope, of human diversity at a level that makes our existing ethnic diversity look trite.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:52.000
And subcultures will be very intolerant to this new diversity, but I'm excited for it.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:58.000
I'm excited for it because I think that when we have new perspectives, when we have new ways of doing things,

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.000
a new cultural optimization, we get something more beautiful.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:08.000
And one of the core focuses of our foundation is trying to get the cost of this technology as low as possible.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:11.000
And a lot of people, they hear about this technology and they go, oh, it must cost a fortune.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
I mean, theoretically, it doesn't really.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:17.000
You're looking at genome sequencing, which we've gotten tremendously cheap.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:22.000
And then once the genome is sequenced, you're just comparing it to a data table.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:28.000
So right now, you know, if you did this at the state level, it would be tremendously inexpensive to do.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:34.000
And, you know, you could do this for like 50 cents a family and maybe like $50 per egg that's sequenced.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:39.000
And when you compare this to the cost of IVF, that is like nothing.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:44.000
And many states are already supporting IVF, like the UK, like Israel.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:53.000
So to say that this technology could be widely available is not an irresponsible thing to claim at all.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
And I'm really excited for it.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Can you see why some people would feel uncomfortable or feel that this is a controversial technology to start using to be able to select for particular traits that a child would have?

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Yeah, I mean, I see that when the problem is that it's controversial, except in every specific instance.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
It's controversial to your selecting that your kids don't get cancer.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:21.000
It's controversial to your selecting that your kids don't get major depressive disorder.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:25.000
And if you stopped me and my kid ended up committing suicide, are you at all to blame for that?

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Do you take any responsibility?

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.000
And then people are like, well, this technology isn't foolproof.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
It doesn't 100% prevent those things.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:39.000
And that's like, you know, one of these religious extremists who don't want to do blood transfusions being for their kid, you know, when their kid's dying or something.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Like, well, blood transfusion doesn't always work.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.000
It's like, so what?

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
You're giving your kid a chance.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:51.000
I mean, smoking during pregnancy doesn't always cause your child to have tons of deformities, but it's probably not advised.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Yeah.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:55.000
And I support the cultural groups that don't want to use this.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
They may be right in the long term, you know?

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Humanity is an experiment, right?

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
They may be right.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.000
I may be wrong.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
And the future will prove which group is right and wrong.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:09.000
And we might might turn out that all of these decisions we're making, they don't end up making any difference, right?

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:12.000
All we're using this technology for right now is to order our eggs.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Now, suppose somebody was like, oh, yeah, but I just want to create tons of embryos and choose the best embryos, right?

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
And this is where I think you get the genuinely...

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.000
What do you mean?

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Sorry, what do you mean when you say order your eggs?

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Oh, it's the choice.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:30.000
It determines the eggs we choose first, but we still hope to use all of our embryos.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Not eggs, embryos.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:37.000
But so it's not like we're saying this human gets to exist or this human doesn't get to exist because of their genes.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:44.000
But I mean, functionally, eventually, because my wife has a C-section with every pregnancy, they're probably eventually going to take it out to some extent we are doing that.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:55.000
But I can understand, like when people say every human embryo is a life and you shouldn't be playing these games, that's the moral argument against what we're doing that I think holds the most water.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:05.000
The way that I look at that argument is to say, well, IVF generally, which needs, you know, you need to discard some eggs often if you're going to do IVF in any sort of economically sustainable way.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:10.000
It requires you discarding embryos and it expands the human fertility window.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:21.000
So to me, from my cultural perspective, every human I decide not to have, like if somebody was like, okay, pick up this pin and a human doesn't exist in the future, I'll decide not to have a human.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:24.000
If you pick up this pin, then I have functionally killed that human.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:34.000
And so I can understand why like Catholic groups and stuff like that would look at what we're doing and say that, well, I think that humanity only starts at like sperm production.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Or at the production of an embryo.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.000
And so I get that argument.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:38.000
It's just not my cultural practice.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:46.000
And I hope that they can at least understand the spirit with which we're doing this, which is to, you know, maximize the number of offspring we have and increase their quality of life.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:53.000
If all that you're doing is playing around with the order of the embryos that you have, why does the order matter?

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Well, because we likely won't be able to use all of them.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.000
I mean, really,

01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Okay, but that's the same.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.000
Like choosing the order is the same as discarding, right?

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Yeah, it's probably functionally the same.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:08.000
But I mean, again, I just don't know how I can explain to my kid.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Oh, yeah, you got cancer because I decided not to do this when it was.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:16.000
So I had Johnny Anomaly on the show about two months ago.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:17.000
And I love the guy.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Yeah.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
He really, he really sort of opened my eyes to this.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:31.000
And the most compelling argument that I heard was as soon as you concede that, let's say the testing that some Jewish groups, Ashkenazi Jews, I think go through.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:38.000
To ensure that they don't partner up with, yeah, Tasek partner up with somebody that is going to give their child something that's awful.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
The same thing occurs within other groups.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:55.000
And then roll the clock forward a tiny little bit and you say, if we can select to avoid really, really reliably heritable cancer that is just every single woman all the way back for as long as I can research it has always had some form of cancer.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:09.000
As soon as we can select for that to not happen, you open the door to say, well, okay, what's the difference between that and selecting for someone that's a little bit more conscientious because conscientiousness is associated with improved outcomes in life.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.000
What about somebody that's not going to have depression?

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.000
What about somebody that's not going to have anxiety?

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:24.000
What about somebody that's blah, blah, blah, like as soon as you open the door to not having something negative, you also then look start to get into selecting toward positive traits too.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Is there a line that gets drawn in the sand for you with regards to this?

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:32.000
No, I believe every family should be able to make their own reproductive choices.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.000
And when we talk about things like IQ, he's absolutely right.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:42.000
If you look at this really rough thing we have now, IQ, that I hope we can break apart into a bunch of different things and get much more specific ways.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Right now, I mean, this is correlated with lower rates of rape, lower rates of incarceration, lower rates of, I mean, raping other people, lower rates of murdering other people.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Like there are real reasons why you may select for this.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
And I love when people are like, oh, that's unethical.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:10.000
And I'm like, we live in a culture today where it is normal to dope your kids with amphetamines so that they score slightly higher on standardized tests where people do these little things where they're like, what would I give for two points of IQ?

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:16.000
And yet the fact that you could make a selection here is off the table.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:19.000
But we also need to consider that eventually as a species, we're going to have to do this.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
And this is something that people just aren't talking about.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:25.000
So if you look at, okay, dysgenic pressures.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:31.000
So historically, like 50% of humans died, you know, in childhood or early in their life hood or something like that.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.000
Right.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:36.000
And this prevented a lot of the diseases that we see in our society today.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:47.000
As we get better at things like C-section and keeping kids alive and stuff like that, we're going to see an increasing number of heritable diseases that previously would have been selected out of humanity.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:52.000
So you really only get two choices before every human is just a walking ball of cancer.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Either you start selecting humans before they're born, or three choices, or you start completely editing and writing humans.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:05.000
I think maybe there you can get into even more morality, or you start selecting humans after they're born.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Or I guess you can just enter this future where everyone's like this walking cancer golem of all of these things that previously would have been selected out, but our medical technology.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:26.000
I think that the most ethical choice there long term is probably to make these selections before, you know, the cells really begin to replicate.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:44.000
In your eyes, is there anything different ethically between rolling the dice of which sperm is going to get there first with which egg at which particular time during the years bunch of cycles and selecting.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Let's say that you were able to do a selection somehow that didn't involve discarding eggs because that would be a difference.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:24:07.000
As far as you're concerned, is there anything different about parents going out of their way to choose the kind of life traits person that is going to come out as opposed to just saying we roll the dice when it happens, it happens.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:11.000
And with the combination that happens is what the child is going to get.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
Well, I mean, we as a society have been doing this for a while.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:25.000
I mean, if you consider that sort of thing, you know, eugenics, then not allowing brothers and sisters to marry as eugenics, because the reason presumably we have those losses that leads to negative genetic outcomes.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:31.000
Again, I just go back to I say that reproductive choice should always be at the level of the family.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:38.000
And as soon as the state or an outside force says that a family can make these genetic choices and can't make these genetic choices.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:50.000
That is the core of what eugenics is because you are saying people born of these genetic choices are somehow genetically morbid or or or like some sort of a monstrosity.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:51.000
And then what do you do?

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.000
What they're a second class citizen?

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.000
I don't know.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:25:02.000
I just don't think there's any way where you can begin to police families, genetic choices that doesn't turn into the the most evil of eugenics.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Do you think that there's an ethical difference between selecting embryos and going in there and actually manipulating genes and tinkering with stuff directly?

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Yeah, I think in a lot of people's mind, there is a difference.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:19.000
But I think that again, this should be a cultural choice.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:23.000
I think that every parent should have the choice to to make the gene.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:28.000
It's always funny when people they say, oh, he and his wife think that we're they're like genetically superior.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
I'm like, we're the ones editing our genes.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Like we think we are the least genetically superior of anyone.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:38.000
We are editing our genes through the hoops to try and make them as viable as possible.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Yeah, exactly.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:45.000
So here's one final thing, you know, to tie the two things that we've spoken about today together.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:52.000
A lot of people are told about the miracle that is IVF.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:26:01.000
There are some concerns, I think that maybe women and men are overly reliant on it to believe that it can extend the fertility window out essentially indefinitely.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:04.000
IVG, which may actually end up doing this.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
Maybe we'll we'll see.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:07.000
I'm a fan.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
You want to talk about what IVG is?

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.000
Fuck it.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
Tell everybody what IVG is and tell them it.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Tell them it in a very accessible way because Johnny taught me it and I don't I couldn't recite it.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:19.000
So teach it as if you're teaching it to a golden retriever.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:26.000
IVG basically means that you can create eggs and sperm from any human cell.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:30.000
So it means that two gay people could have a kid that's biologically theirs.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:38.000
But it also means you can do fancier things like you could have a poly couple of like 13 people and they could have a kid that is biologically out of theirs.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:42.000
It basically allows you to I mean in the simplest form is just egg and sperm from anyone.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:48.000
But this is really cool because it means, you know, if you're older, you know, you can have kids that are that are healthier.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:51.000
And a lot of people are having kids when they're older.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:57.000
But then, you know, you combine this with artificial wombs who were close on that technology to that completely.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Like when we're talking about cultural changes and technological and cultural solutions to technological and cultural problems, a lot of them are going to look like IVG.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
A lot of them are going to look like artificial wombs.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:16.000
What we may find is one of the solutions to the current collapsing birth rates is like gay triads or something like that, right?

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Or poly cities.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Or like, I'm not saying that these things will work, you know, but if any of these sorts of cultural groups want to survive into the future,

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:33.000
they're going to have to find ways to make themselves raising kids and keeping their culture alive work.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:43.000
And so I'm very excited to see how these technologies expand options for people and expand the diversity of cultures that are possible.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Because there's many more creative people than me out there who might find even more exciting ways to raise families and increase the cultural diversity of our species.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Just going back to the conversation about IVF.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:02.000
For the people that haven't been through it or don't know somebody that has been through it, what's the experience like?

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:03.000
It's painful.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:04.000
You should ask my wife.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:07.000
I've seen these shots right into the butt.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.000
I don't know how she handles it.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:09.000
And she does this as a routine.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:10.000
We have a kid a year.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
She wants to keep doing this for like 10 years.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:20.000
I don't, she is a tough, like, um, but it is painful.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:24.000
This woman was a woman who worked through her first pregnancy.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.000
She went to the hospital.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:29.000
She was taking sales calls while she was having contractions.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Back to work was in five days.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:35.000
The level of pain she felt when getting egg extractions and stuff like that was higher.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
We're not higher than pregnancy, but I mean, it was hard.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:40.000
She is not somebody who complains about pain.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
She doesn't complain about the shots, but the egg extractions, they really hurt.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:46.000
And I know that because she wouldn't, she wouldn't mess around with that stuff.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
So what I can say is it's a, it's a painful process.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:56.000
But if you see kids as like your mandate in life for me, not having kids is the equivalent of suicide or something like that.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Um, it's just not an option for me.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Um, and I, I'm glad that my wife, you know, I love if you had her on sometime.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:06.000
She's a, she's a weird woman, um, but really fun.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Um, she's seeing similar to I do.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
And so it's just not even something we would consider.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
We're going to do everything we can.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:16.000
And we tried to conceive naturally for like five years and it just wasn't in the cards.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:21.000
And I think increasingly what families are going to realize is, uh, it's really hard to get pregnant these days.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Humans are becoming infertile as a species.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
We're becoming infertile.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:30.000
And you're, and when you look at things like artificial wombs, they may be one of our only shots.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Uh, because when we hear, when I hear women who have these complicated pregnancy, when I hear stillbirths,

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:41.000
oh my God, if your wife has carried a kid or you've carried a kid, when you think of a baby dying in that last trimester

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:45.000
and you know that with stuff like artificial wombs, we can lower the probability of that,

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:50.000
it just breaks your heart and you would want to do anything you can to accelerate the pace of this technology.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Malcolm Collins, ladies and gentlemen, dude, I, I find all of this,

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:59.000
I find all of this discussion a combination of harrowing, inspiring and interesting.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Uh, so for the people who want to find out more about the stuff that you do and keep up to date with your work, where should they go?

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:11.000
So, uh, our book series, The Pragment to Sky Theory, The Pragment to Sky to Craft and Religion is the most relevant to this conversation.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.000
It's on Amazon, it's for 99 cents, the ebook.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:17.000
Um, Twitter account, Simone H. Collins.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:20.000
Um, or just, you know, search Simone and Malcolm Collins on Twitter.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
We have a joint account because I hate using Twitter.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Um, and we're recently starting up our YouTube and podcast.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Um, uh, we just uploaded the first episode of starting it back up today, which is, uh, Simone and Malcolm Collins based camp.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
Um, so, uh, we're hoping that that's fun.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:39.000
I'd love to have you on some time if we're able to get enough followers to be worth your time.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Malcolm, I appreciate you. Thank you.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
What's happening, people? Thank you very much for tuning in.
