0	4880	What do you make of the last few months of fallout from Yale and Harvard and such?
4880	11600	I mean, yeah, we saw that big testimonial from the presidents. Yeah, it was Harvard, MIT, Penn.
13120	16640	I mean, I wasn't surprised by it. I mean, a lot of people, I think, are finally fully
16640	19360	realizing they're coming to their senses. People have been saying this for a while now.
20000	24640	Oh, you know, eventually the pendulum will swing back and people will finally figure out what's
24640	29760	really going on in these institutions and this sort of ideology that's been spilling out of the
29840	35280	universities. And now I think they finally are actually truly realizing it. But yeah, I saw the
35840	41200	it's kind of the birth of what a lot of people call wokeness in 2015 when I arrived on campus at
41200	46400	Yale. And that was my first semester. I saw what was happening there. And yeah, I mean,
46400	51200	I think you can draw a straight line from some of those events in 2015 to what we're seeing now.
51200	56080	And yeah, it's been really ugly, but, you know, kind of kind of amusing, you know, from my perspective,
56080	59360	because I, you know, I was one of the, I'd like to think that I was one of the sort of
59920	64640	early observers and people who could recognize what was occurring. And then later on, you know,
64640	70320	so Jordan Peterson was another and there have been other critics of higher ed and especially
70320	76960	these elite universities. But yeah, it's been really, really amusing and also sort of disheartening
77760	87040	It's this sort of odd blend of fatalism, shard and Freud, nihilism, sort of pleasure,
87040	93040	displeasure, like, ick, pity. It's a real concatenation of things. And obviously,
93040	97920	we've got a couple of mutual friends that have either been directly or tangentially involved,
97920	102640	Vincent, our mutual friend, I managed to get removed from a higher education institution
103280	108080	because of him appearing on this podcast, Carol Hoeven, who is, you know, a really good
108080	113280	mutual friend, has kind of been thrust into the middle of this. She told me that she basically
113280	118880	felt like she'd been used like a football. And for the people who know who Carol is,
118880	123280	she went on Rogan, I think she cried like six times on Joe's show, she cried at least three
123280	127280	times on mine. We went for breakfast, I'm pretty sure she cried like three times at breakfast.
127360	132720	She's just a very sort of emotional person. She is, she's really sort of feeling this.
133600	142320	Yeah, you realize in a sort of proxy fucking battle like this, the people that are useful
142320	146240	political footballs to be kicked around often end up paying a pretty high price and no one ever
146240	150400	thinks about them because you're like, oh, no, but you're, you know, you're a flaming warrior
150400	154160	for free speech or whatever. And you go, well, yeah, but I didn't ask to be.
154240	159280	Yeah, very few people want to be fired. I mean, a lot of people may not be familiar with just
159280	163760	how difficult it is to get an academic job in the first place. I mean, I'm friends with Vincent,
163760	169840	I saw, I mean, he was hustling hard. And he had a very impressive academic record. And no one
169840	174880	wants to be in that position. I think their critics or their detractors say, like, oh,
174880	179040	you know, oh, pour me with your cancel culture. And now look at you going on all these podcasts
179040	183200	and playing up your victimhood and all of this. But that's not what it is. I think it's, for some
183280	186640	people, it's just a consolation that while I lost my dream job, at the very least, I can sort of
186640	191680	communicate. Let me salvage fucking something. Exactly. And yeah, I was observing all of this
191680	196880	from afar. I mean, one thing that I've pointed out before is that for every, like public academic
196880	202720	cancellation you see, there are probably five to 10 others that are not covered in the media.
202720	206560	Most people actually don't enjoy the limelight that much, especially academics who tend to be
206560	209760	kind of weird nerds with their obscure niche interests, they just want to keep their head
209840	214720	down, do their research, be left alone. And then suddenly they are accused of X, Y, or Z,
214720	220400	and they just want to silently, you know, have it blow over. And that's like the sort of modal
220400	227600	case, that's the usual case. And so yeah, it's been, we can see it now that finally people
227600	231680	are recognizing that there's a there's a serious issue. I didn't even want to an academic job.
231680	237360	I mean, by the time I was probably about halfway through my PhD, I saw what was happening.
237360	243600	I remember, yeah, I would have very contentious discussions with other PhD students and postdocs
243600	248480	and kind of early career researchers. And I would tell them like, I don't think that, you know,
248480	253840	if you color outside the lines, if you are an independent thinker, it will be very difficult
253840	260560	for you to get a sort of typical tenure track academic job now, not impossible, but just much
260560	265040	harder than it would have been maybe 10 or 15 years ago. And people say, Oh, no, that's ridiculous.
265040	269440	It's ridiculous. And now, you know, four, four plus years later, I'm seeing like some of those
269440	274160	friends are having difficulty, some of them have been hired and fired by now. I mean, it's been,
274160	277920	you know, I've seen the whole the whole spectrum of outcomes, some of them have successfully obtained
277920	282640	jobs and just, you know, keep their mouth shut. But for me, I just, that wasn't what I thought
282640	288240	academia was going to be like. I thought it was going to be, you know, this little kind of contained
288240	292080	a bubble, you know, the, I guess some people call it the ivory tower, right, where you can live that
292080	298720	life of the mind and communicate interesting ideas and debate and disagree, but still sort of
298720	301760	inch your way towards the truth, or at least inch your way, inch your way towards interesting
301760	306720	ideas. But, you know, that's interestingly happening more on places like podcasts and
306720	312480	sub-stack and alternate sort of parallel institutions. Yeah, it's fascinating to think
313120	318000	as well about, I guess, soft cancellations. I had Ricky Schlott on who co-authored the
318080	323600	Canceling of the American Mind with Greg Lukyanov. And she was talking about all of the different
323600	331120	ways that people kind of get soft cancelled. And it's just not being invited to the end of your
331120	336480	party, you know, it's people sitting in different locations to you. I think she went to maybe NYU
336480	342960	Stern. And she was hiding Jordan Peterson books under her bed, you know, like fucking Anne Frank
343040	348880	in the attic, that philosophical Anne Frank. And she was saying that, you know, there's lots of
349760	353280	sort of ideological shit tests, she called them, which I thought was a really great name.
354080	358960	You know, what do you think about Ben Shapiro? You know, just like fucking throw that hand
358960	363520	grenade into the room and see if anyone pipes up. Or it doesn't pipe up. That was something
363520	366720	that I learned when I was in grad school was does anyone just remain silent and not say,
366720	370320	oh, he's so, he's an evil right wing, whatever, right? If they just kind of keep their head down
370320	373360	and don't say anything, you know, I sort of, oh, I observed that.
373360	378320	Silence is compliance or whatever. Silence is violence or whatever it is.
378320	382000	What about the, you had this interesting idea about the hidden hierarchies
382000	388000	of the Harvard extension school thing. Yeah, well, I saw that with, you know, I was, you know,
388000	394560	observing what was occurring on Twitter slash X with Christopher Rufo, who was one of the
394560	402240	sort of architects of pointing out and removing the Harvard professor after her comments about,
403040	408080	you know, kind of condoning antisemitism on campus and then discovering her plagiarism and all of
408080	414080	this. But, you know, after he, you know, he was perceived to be successful, I mean, she was,
414080	419840	she was ousted, she was pressured to resign and she did all of these professors at elite universities
419840	424960	and all of these, you know, this, you know, university supporting members of the chattering
424960	430400	class were saying, oh, Christopher Rufo got a degree from the Harvard extension school. And,
430400	435360	you know, are people aware that that's not the real Harvard and people, do people understand that
435360	441360	that's not typically what we think of as a real graduate studies degree at a master,
441360	446720	it's not a real master's degree from Harvard. And they just wanted people to be very aware that this,
447280	451200	you know, this sort of outsider, this pleb who got this degree from this
451200	455520	extension school, he's not a real academic, he's not a real serious thinker. Yeah, he's written
455520	460080	books. Yes, he works at a very prominent think tank. And yes, he's like very successful in the real
460080	464320	world, but he has his degree, which is sort of getting things backwards, right? You want the degree
466080	469200	in order to signify that you're capable in the real world. But, you know, they have the, oh,
469200	474080	this guy's capable in the real world, but now they're looking at the degree as if it's somehow,
474080	478400	it's fraudulent and therefore this nullifies all of his accomplishments. That's indicative of his
478400	483760	real value. Exactly. Yeah, they're placing his value on the educational credential rather than
484400	489680	on his effectiveness in his life and in his career. So, you know, I'm watching this and I'm
489680	494720	thinking like, yeah, this is exactly, I mean, I've seen this, you know, since entering college,
494720	500240	since entering higher ed, this strange status anxiety, particularly among people who attend
500240	503920	these kind of institutions. I mean, the people who are pointing this out about Rufo's degree
503920	508480	were professors or graduates of whatever, Harvard or Oberlin or Stanford, whatever.
508480	512240	Look at these kinds of places. People that knew the language, they understood what an
512240	517520	extension school was. Yes, exactly. And it's just amazing to me that Harvard even has
517520	521520	this program in the first place because it relies on that duplicitous game of,
522880	527360	you know, if you're a member of the unwashed masses and you go to the Harvard Extension
527360	531200	School website, it actually says, we are Harvard, you will have the Harvard degree,
531200	534640	you can put it, it even says something like you'll have the, you know, you'll be able to put
534640	540240	Harvard on your resume. This is on the official website. While simultaneously communicating
540240	544160	the coded message to everyone else at Harvard and everyone else in this sort of rarefied segment of
544160	547600	society that, you know, we have to do that, you know, we have to put that on the website,
547600	550720	but it's not really Harvard. You're not on the main stage, you're kind of on the second stage
550720	554480	in the festival. It's like the overflow room. Why would, like, it's just, it shocks me that
554480	559680	they're willing to take the reputational hit to operate a degree mill. I mean, to me, it's just
559680	563360	very, like, tawdry. Like, it's almost like, you know, I have this, maybe this judgmental attitude
563360	566880	about, like, this is, like, very kind of vulgar that you guys would even do this in the first place
566880	571200	that you're playing this game. And yeah, I thought it was very, yeah, very ugly the way that they were,
571200	575760	they were pointing this out about Rufo. And it also ended up backfiring, I think, because
576880	582880	they felt this sort of, this faction of cultural elites and these legacy institutions felt threatened.
582880	587680	They felt like they had received an L. And so they had to lash out and get back at him.
587680	593600	Well, it's the same as, you know, someone does something to you, a really cutting jibe. And
593600	600160	you're like, shit shoes. Like, it's just, you know, it's the only thing that you're like,
600160	603600	fucking just grappling at something. I remember once there was this guy, it's so funny,
603600	607520	there was this dude stood in the front door of a nightclub complaining about the fact that he
607520	612880	couldn't get in. And he just kept on chirping and kept on chirping and kept on chirping. And I
612880	616560	was feeling particularly pissy that day or whatever. So I said something back to him.
616560	622160	And I've got like two or three, six foot four Geordie guerrillas either side of me that are
622160	627200	working. And I'm busy trying to organize clipboard to something else. And he couldn't think of anything
627200	631760	to do. So I had a necklace on of some kind, like on the outside of a t-shirt, and he sort of reached
631760	636320	forward and like, grab, grab that. And like, that was the one thing. And then sort of scuttled
636320	644160	off. And I was like, like my 35 pounds, like fashion net necklace isn't a big deal. But just
644160	647200	that that's the one thing. And it's kind of the same as Christopher Rufo's like,
651520	654640	extension school, like it's not, you're not part of the real chattering classes.
654640	660000	Yeah, yeah, that's, yeah, it was very like short-sighted. And, and ultimately, I think it was
660000	665280	damaging to them. Oh, anyone else that's got that degree, always thinking about going to that place
665280	669040	is like, Oh, well, they said that ultimately, when the rubber meets the road, Chris Rufo's
669040	674000	like just one of the fucking, like peasants, the same as the rest of us. So maybe I shouldn't
674560	678720	think about, Oh, that's interesting. So you're saying that, that anyone who might want to apply
678720	682960	for the Harvard extension school will see that. And so they'll have fewer applicants, you know,
682960	687440	the institution will ultimately be less profitable. I didn't even think about that part.
687440	690560	Definitely less prestigious. I was, I was thinking more on the reputation end of it rather than the
690560	695120	sort of economic end. But yeah, this, this idea that, that people will observe, I mean,
696000	699920	I thought it was an error for two reasons. One was that it was most people don't like snobs,
699920	703280	right? So they see this and they just feel like icky about it, that they're even pointing this
703280	708640	out in the first place, or that they think that they're somehow superior. They don't like that
708640	713120	attitude. And then the second was that it, to me, it kind of exposed the, the hollowness
713680	720080	of the egalitarian dogma, the supposed egalitarian dogma of elite academia that, you know, oh,
720080	726000	we're all for equity and, you know, DEI or whatever it is that we're so accepting and tolerant and
726000	731600	welcoming. But by the way, like, you know, your, your aristocratic title is fraudulent and you're
731600	736320	a fake. And, you know, so, you know, I was texting a friend earlier about this. He's, he's actually
736320	740160	a grad student at Harvard. And I was like, my impression of this was basically like,
740160	744720	the attitude at elite universities is everyone is equal, but some people are less equal than others,
744720	749280	right? It's a sort of a spin on, on the, the animal farm idea. We're all equal, but some people
749280	754240	are more equal. You heard that George Orwell quote. You said how in The Road to Wigan,
754240	758960	Pierre George Orwell is explaining how upper class snobs, while theoretically pining for a
759040	763920	classless society cling like glue to their miserable fragments of social prestige.
763920	767840	I love that. Yeah, I love that line. I mean, the whole, yeah, the book is great. Orwell was so
768480	774240	astute in his analysis of class, but that was just, yeah, I mean, this has been going on for,
774240	778560	you know, a hundred years now. And that was the first thing that came to mind when I was seeing
778560	784080	this, that, you know, these, these supposedly open-minded, tolerant, welcoming people were
784080	788560	suddenly pointing out that he got a degree from, from the institution, right? Like it's your website.
788720	793280	You've got over the, you've got over the bar that everybody asked for, but you kind of landed in
793280	796960	an awkward place on the crash mat. Yeah. You know, and yeah, you're so right. It's this,
797920	804320	and this is why fundamentally, I think that people are so skeptical and critical of anyone who
805040	810480	proselytises about their morality or how ethical or how caring they are publicly. You should go,
810480	815120	what are you covering up for? I don't believe that you actually think that. And sure enough,
815120	819840	when the gloves are off and you see someone in a little bit of pressure or receiving a little
819840	825920	bit of heat, where did they go? Well, all of the inclusivity and egalitarianism and care for the
825920	830800	beauty of academia overall, all of that's out the window. Yeah. Yeah. When the pressure is on,
830800	835200	right? When people feel threatened, when they feel in a sense of sort of emotional intensity,
835200	838880	a lot of negative emotion, suddenly, you know, the mask slips and you can see what they really
838880	846320	like. Toys are out of the pram. They're just as, and, you know, this is the concern that people
846320	851040	had all along. Yeah. It's like, oh, that's what we thought you were like. We thought that you were
852160	859040	highfalutin, not actually caring, adrenicone drinking, long hooded nose, pentagram dancing,
859040	863280	like dickheads. Yeah. And sure enough, your, your mask has slipped. So I mean, this,
864160	866720	you've got your brand new book out, which everyone can go and buy right now,
866720	872080	as you're going by this very second. We haven't ever spoken about this because pretty much since
872080	876400	I've known you at some point, you've been working on your memoir, Troubled. Yeah.
877040	883760	Luxury beliefs. Yeah. That is a kind of example of luxury belief, although it's not patient zero.
883760	887520	How do you explain to my audience that hasn't yet heard you talk about a
887520	891680	topic that you've repopularized? How do you explain luxury beliefs?
891760	896960	Right. Luxury beliefs are ideas and opinions that confer status on the affluent,
896960	902800	while often inflicting costs on the lower classes. And a core component of a luxury belief is that
902800	908720	the believer is often sheltered from the consequences of his or her belief. And, you know, we can get
908720	912400	into specific examples. But yeah, I like this one that we've been sort of touching on this
912400	917280	snobbish attitude about higher ed and how, yeah, so on the one hand, I mean, you're,
917280	920640	when people are pointing out that this school or that school is better than the other,
921840	925840	you are sort of boosting your own status, right? Especially these people who are
925840	929280	already graduates of or teaching at these institutions, they're bolstering their own
929280	934000	status. And then, you know, by speaking in this way about the hierarchies and,
934000	937280	you know, which school is actually above which other school they are sort of
937280	940560	inflicting costs on everyone else who would like to ascend the educational ladder,
940560	946000	who would like to get a degree. But a lot of these people just don't interact much with people who
946880	950880	are upwardly mobile or trying to be upwardly mobile, who are trying to go to university,
950960	955600	trying to get a degree. The vast majority, and I talk about a lot of the statistics in
955600	961360	my book about this in the later chapters, about how more than 80% of Ivy League graduates have
961360	965040	at least one parent who went to university. I mean, that's, they're sort of a mercenaries from
965040	969680	birth. They've never actually interacted with a person or had a 15 minute conversation with
969680	974800	someone who doesn't have a degree or on their way to getting a degree. And it's just not on their
974800	979760	radar. And so in their world, you know, everyone went to university or everyone should go or,
979760	983440	you know, anyone who doesn't go to the same category of university that they went to,
983440	989120	there's something wrong with them. And I noticed this a lot when I arrived on campus. I mean,
989120	994000	and it's very subtle. I mean, at first, I was sort of, you know, to some degree, I think I was
994000	998320	duped because I fell for the, oh, everyone's equal, everyone's fine, everyone. And, you know,
998320	1002880	also the other thing about these institutions now is that they don't, they don't look the same,
1002880	1008400	right? One of the ideas about, or one of the components of the luxury belief idea is that
1008400	1013840	luxury beliefs have to a large extent replaced luxury goods, which isn't to say that luxury
1013840	1018240	goods don't still signify status, brand names and all of those things still matter. But my claim is
1018240	1023840	that luxury goods have become a noisier signal of status. You can't tell right away necessarily
1023840	1028320	anymore when you just go about your life in public, who's rich and who's poor just by how they look.
1030160	1034560	And so, you know, I build on these sort of sociological frameworks in my writing and in my
1034640	1039520	book, work from Thorsten Wablin at the turn of the 20th century, here with the theory of the
1039520	1044400	leisure class, he wrote about how, you know, the upper class, the aristocrats of his time,
1045200	1050240	they demonstrated their status through, you know, tuxedos and evening gowns and pocket watches and
1050240	1058160	monocles and expensive and intricate hobbies and attending lavish events, hiring servants,
1058160	1063360	those kinds of things. And then by the mid 20th century, there was a sociologist named Pierre
1063360	1067280	Bourdieu who wrote a book called Distinction, a social critique of the judgment of taste.
1068080	1075040	And one of his insights in that book was that rich people, affluent people, they'll convert their
1075040	1079280	economic capital into cultural capital. And so they'll spend money in order to
1079840	1085280	demonstrate their class or exhibit their membership to this rarefied strata of society.
1085280	1089040	And so in his day, you know, again, in the mid 20th century, and he was mostly commenting on
1089040	1092720	French culture, but people can sort of understand what, you know, what he's getting at, where people
1092800	1098800	would spend money to learn about the subtleties of wine or the intricacies of art or
1099360	1104160	falconry or something. Yeah, falconry or beagling or golf or these kinds of, you know,
1104160	1109680	that you have to have money, you can't be the kind of person who works a manual job or who,
1109680	1116000	you know, soft hands. You see the same thing in almost the reverse in Asian societies at the
1116000	1119840	moment when I went to Thailand for the first time, all of the receptionists were wearing
1119920	1125120	lighter makeup on their face. I thought to myself, why, because it's so silly because,
1125120	1129440	you know, the face finishes on whatever the jawline here and, you know, the blending between
1129440	1134240	the face and the neck is difficult to do. And I thought, why, and I asked someone, why the
1134240	1137840	fuck are they, they're making their faces pale at this at all? Well, it's because the
1137840	1141760	indigent laborers, the people that work out in the fields are heavily tanned. So the higher
1141760	1146960	class jobs are the ones that are inside, which means that the paler you are, the more status
1147760	1153120	you is conferred on you by your profession. But then I also realized how stupid of me
1153120	1158960	and how, you know, myopically Western of me to do that, coming from Newcastle upon Tyne,
1158960	1164960	the Jersey shore of the UK, where girls turn themselves orange to signify, I have all of
1164960	1169280	this leisure time, I'm able to go away on holiday to exotic places and lay by the beach and get
1169280	1172880	sun on me. I like that. Yeah, yeah, that's very interesting. Yeah, yeah. So if you,
1173600	1177520	if you live in like Northern Europe or somewhere cold where there isn't a lot of sun,
1177520	1181440	having a tan is the signifier status. So yeah, I think, yeah, that's, that's an important point
1181440	1185680	here that, you know, it does vary from culture to culture. I mean, I point, you know, I point
1185680	1190800	this out the research and everything in my writing about how status itself, the specific
1190800	1195280	examples and manifestations can be ephemeral, they can be, they can vary by time and place and
1195280	1200400	culture and generation and so on. But the desire for status, the desire to exhibit it to show other
1200400	1207520	people how prestigious or how dominant or how, you know, how important you are that that remains.
1207520	1212320	And so my, my claim is that luxury beliefs, I mean, they're mostly confined to that sort of
1212320	1216240	highly educated people who attend all the universities, people who study there, people who
1216240	1225280	are graduates of these places, who tend to operate legacy institutions who run media and,
1225280	1231120	and academia and who generate knowledge, people who work in sort of culturally influential
1232000	1235920	organizations. And a lot of them hold these luxury beliefs. I think we saw this
1236880	1241520	in 2020 and 2021 with the Defund the Police movement. I mean, I coined the term luxury
1241520	1247920	beliefs in 2019 and started to write about it and do the research to sort of support this idea
1247920	1254880	and point everything out that sort of all of, all of the, the, the sociological concepts
1254880	1259200	undergirding it. And then the, like six months later, people started talking about defunding
1259200	1264000	the police. I was like, I don't even have to, I felt like I didn't even have to like, you know,
1264000	1266720	here's the reasoning behind luxury beliefs is just defund the police. Like it's right there,
1266720	1270320	you don't even have to. It's the most, whenever somebody brings up your work to me and talks
1270320	1276720	about luxury beliefs, the patient zero example is defund the police. Yeah, because it's so
1276720	1282160	intuitive. Of course. Can you explain why that encapsulates luxury beliefs? So structurally or
1282160	1287360	functionally so well? Yeah, yeah. So, so, yeah, the luxury beliefs idea, if you say defund the
1287360	1291760	police, you are increasing your own status because I mean, you look like a caring person,
1291760	1300320	you look open-minded and interesting and, and, and highly educated. And so, and it also signifies
1300320	1303120	that you're the kind of person who went to certain kinds of schools, you consume certain
1303120	1309120	kinds of media, you listen to certain kinds of podcasts and so on. And so it makes you look
1309120	1316400	a certain way to your peers. But once the support for defund the police becomes implemented into
1316960	1323040	policy, once police stations and police departments have reduced funding, once you
1323040	1326480	cultivate an attitude, so it's not just the policy, but you're also cultivating the culture
1326480	1331760	and the attitude around law enforcement that, oh, we don't need police. You sort of give permission
1331760	1337920	to people to be suspicious of police or to be derogatory towards police. As a result, we saw
1337920	1344320	that a lot of, a lot of police officers started retiring in large numbers. There's reports in,
1344320	1348720	in major US cities that they're having difficulty with recruitment because if you're a smart,
1348720	1352480	capable young person who wants to make a difference in your community, like, why would you want that
1352480	1359600	job? If you know that people are going to view you with suspicion or with some kind of, you know,
1359680	1365120	that you're sort of malicious or evil, cops, I mean, they get paid okay, but it's not like
1365840	1369440	considering the potential danger they face in their job. Part of the reason why people would
1369440	1377120	want to do it is because cops formerly used to be seen as respectable and admirable and people
1377840	1380960	conferred a lot of status onto them. Well, think about the difference between when
1381520	1385360	a policeman currently in the sort of current defund the police era that we're in,
1385360	1392800	policeman turns up at a scene versus a firefighter or an ambulance A&E person. You know,
1393440	1398880	the other two emergency services are seen heralded as heroes and the police like,
1399600	1406240	ACAB, ACAB, all cops are bastards. I got about that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so who wants that job?
1406240	1411680	And so gradually, and we saw this in the aftermath of the defund the police movement that violent
1411760	1416800	crime spiked all across the US, especially major cities, homicide rates increased to levels not
1416800	1423360	seen since the early 1990s. And so when all of this was unfolding, I actually, I tried to find
1423360	1427120	some survey data to see like who's actually, you know, like, because I don't know anyone in my
1427120	1430560	personal life who thinks that we should defund the police. I mean, other than, you know, some people
1430560	1435920	at Cambridge and other elite universities, but ordinary people who are outside of these institutions,
1435920	1439440	I didn't know anyone who was supporting this movement. So I had a suspicion this was,
1439440	1443040	you know, actually, a legitimate luxury belief. I looked at survey data for it,
1444080	1449360	found one in YouGov in 2020, which found that they collect the data from a representative
1449360	1453760	sample of Americans, and they broke down the data by income category. And it was the highest
1453760	1458080	income Americans who were the most supportive of defunding the police. And it was the lowest
1458080	1464560	income Americans who were the least supportive. And then when later, the different, different
1465520	1472880	findings were reported for major US cities, Minneapolis and Detroit, one in New York City,
1473600	1477040	they found that white Democrats were far more supportive of defending the police than black
1477040	1485120	and Hispanic Democrats. And so it was like the people who were supposedly so kind and so sympathetic
1485120	1489680	towards the marginalized and the dispossessed and the poor and so on, they were supporting
1489760	1494560	something that actually those groups didn't even want. And I mean, an increased number of them
1494560	1501760	were being victimized as a result of it. In my book, I point out that if you compare
1502320	1507680	the lowest income Americans to Americans who earn the median income, there's, what is it,
1507680	1514720	they're two to three times more likely to be victims of violent crimes, they're seven times
1514720	1519040	more likely to be victims of assault, they're 20 times more likely to be victims of sexual assault,
1519040	1523440	like essentially across the board, the lower your income, the more likely you are to be a
1523440	1527680	target of crime. Could do with the police. Yes, exactly. You could, yeah, it would be nice to
1527680	1534000	have someone you could call if you're being burglarized or assaulted. And so yeah, it was a
1534000	1541120	complete sort of backfiring. And I haven't seen, you know, there hasn't really been any sort of
1541120	1545920	accountability or any kind of acknowledgement of what happened in the aftermath of that movement.
1545920	1551600	Yeah, it's wild. And then obviously the big elephant in the room here is that
1551600	1557520	the people who are supporting it are the ones who are the most likely to live in a gated community,
1557520	1564400	in an area or a neighborhood that has not called the police in a decade since the last time that
1564400	1568480	someone from the community that they're probably talking about trying to protect accidentally
1568480	1575520	wandered through their gated community. So it's rules for the but not for me. And let me explain
1575600	1582800	to you, poor, underclass peasant person, what is best for you from my vantage point out here in
1582800	1586960	my very comfortable home? Yes, yes, yeah, yeah. So that's, yeah, that's one of the components
1586960	1591280	of the luxury belief is that the believer sheltered from the consequences of the belief. And so yeah,
1591280	1596320	the people who were supporting the defund the police movement, largely college educated,
1596320	1601280	living in safe communities, living in gated communities, there were reports during the
1601280	1607200	the political unrest in 2020, and all of the BLM demonstrations and so on, all of the riots that
1607200	1611520	people in like rich people in Chicago were hiring private security to patrol their neighborhoods
1611520	1616560	because you know, the police were either distracted due to all of the social unrest and crime that was
1616560	1620560	occurring, or because police were retiring and so on. And so they were hiring private security in
1620560	1625920	these rich neighborhoods. And then in New York City, there were reports of people just fleeing to
1625920	1630320	the Hamptons, like, you know, if you have money and you have resources, you can just flee to your
1630320	1636240	private little gated area and from home start tweeting about defund the police and get all the
1636240	1641600	likes and plot it. Oh my God, you're so caring. I know the cops are so wrong. Like they're
1641600	1646400	treating these poor black people so badly. And you can, I mean, I think people who are
1647520	1653120	sort of affluent upper middle class people, they have a mistaken view of what sort of poverty
1653120	1659440	looks like. Their only exposure to it is when they see, when they see it reported in the media,
1659440	1666080	when it's a criminal who's committed some kind of transgression, and that surfaces up, and then
1666080	1669600	they learn about the criminal's backstory, and they start to feel sympathetic and so on and so
1669600	1675760	forth. And there's not nearly as much time spent on the victims of that person's crime. And so in
1675760	1680960	often what happens is that in at least the imagination of this strata of society that,
1680960	1686080	you know, they conflate poverty with criminality. And the reason why someone commits crimes is
1686080	1689280	because they're poor without really digging into the data or the research and understanding that
1689280	1693120	the vast majority of poor people never commit any crimes. They're more, they're far more likely to
1693120	1698880	be victims of crime than a perpetrator. And they don't really think about this. And then through
1698880	1704960	the sort of portrayal of poverty, I think in pop culture is kind of mistaken to at least in more
1704960	1711760	sort of recent media, where, you know, very few TV shows, it's just not exciting to see
1712320	1716480	some working class person making, you know, minimum wage, going to work,
1716480	1719920	clocking in, clocking out, going home to their family and living a normal life.
1719920	1724000	But it's more interesting to see, you know, the struggling school teacher who decides to break
1724000	1727680	bad and start cooking meth and lashing out at the system. And that's just a much more
1727680	1732720	interesting story. And so that is, I mean, there was this movie that came out, I think it was last
1732720	1736800	year, the year before Emily the criminal with Aubrey Plaza, I don't know if you saw it, but
1736800	1740960	it was, I mean, it was like the perfect kind of movie for this, for this, you know, the luxury
1740960	1746560	belief class. It's this young woman who works in food catering, and she has this dickhead boss.
1746560	1750240	And she has dream, I think she is a college graduate, she has dreams of being an artist,
1750240	1754720	but she has difficulty monetizing her artwork. And so she caters food. But then she like gets
1754720	1759280	hooked in with this gang and like, learns how to shoplift. And, you know, the whole thing is like,
1759280	1762880	you know, well, you know, screw the system, you know, I can't make money off my artwork,
1762880	1766560	and I have to work in food catering. And this is just ridiculous. And so I'm gonna,
1766560	1771440	you know, start stealing and robbing people. And the movie is portraying this as like a
1771440	1776080	perfectly reasonable course of action, right? And this is like, it's basically like breaking bad,
1776080	1780880	but the young woman version for art. Yeah, yeah. And yeah, I just think it's that's,
1780880	1782960	that's part of what drives the luxury beliefs phenomenon.
1783920	1790000	Yeah, it's wild, man. And when you see that, you really can't unsee it. Mary Harrington had this
1790000	1798160	about a lot of the advances that were proposed by the feminist movement in the 50s, 60s, and 70s
1798720	1806800	were put forward by women for whom the impact wouldn't affect them. So a perfect example is,
1806800	1812960	I guess, the push toward independence and the derogation of chivalry by men, because chivalry
1812960	1817200	in some ways can be patronizing, must be patronizing to women, like I can open the door for myself,
1817680	1821760	I can carry my own bags, right? Like I can pull my own chair out, I can pay for my own dinner.
1821760	1828720	And in a world where women are trying to find and establish themselves socioeconomically as
1828720	1833920	independent agents, aside from the husband or partner that they're supposed to need,
1833920	1838800	I can understand why that would be the case. But as she said, it is a direct line from
1839680	1844480	men shouldn't open the door and don't need to, to why you shouldn't hit your wife,
1844480	1850080	right? Because the consensus is women are more fragile, vulnerable, and need to be protected,
1850080	1856320	and men should be the ones that do that protecting. And it's the women who are married to men who had
1856320	1861440	a two-pound household, who had a relatively good example of how to treat women when they were growing
1861440	1868320	up, who have been through all of the institutions that have kind of softly embedded what chivalry
1868320	1874160	is in any case, because that's just the way that a more sophisticated social life goes.
1874880	1879680	But that doesn't think about women who are in an underclass or working-class environment,
1879680	1883760	who are in a relationship with a guy who never knew his father, whose mom was cycling in and out
1883760	1888240	of different boyfriends or partners or whatever in the house, who was maybe abused physically or
1888240	1893040	verbally or emotionally or whatever while they were growing up, all of whose friends are
1894000	1897840	ruffians that are going about and anti-social behavior and all of this stuff. And it's like,
1897840	1904240	well, I know that for you, lady that drives a Mercedes-Benz, you might like the idea of being
1904240	1909280	liberated from men holding the door open for you, but downstream from that, you've also liberated
1909280	1913120	women from being protected from their underclass partner from hitting them when he gets annoyed
1913120	1918320	on a nighttime. And I really, I just thought that that was such an interesting frame. The same thing
1918320	1926800	goes for support for abortion rights, right? When you think about that, I think that it is skewed
1926800	1933840	toward the people in the upper class believe that it is a great idea to restrict abortion rights
1933840	1943680	overall, to give less access. But you think, well, maybe if you were woman 213 of one particular
1943680	1951200	village somewhere who's six kids deep to three different men, maybe easy access to birth control
1951200	1956720	would be a good thing for them to have. And yeah, it's just, it's so interesting how it can be
1956720	1961200	split up by race or it can be split up by class or it can be split up within gender.
1961200	1965600	Yeah, yeah, yeah, that was, I mean, it's interesting because I think that
1966480	1970480	a lot of the people who promote these views or who think that these are sort of progressive or
1970480	1975920	fashionable or enlightened, they don't think about how it would affect someone outside of
1975920	1981120	their social strata, or they mistakenly overextend the way that they think to everyone else that,
1981120	1983920	well, here's what would be good for me, or here's what would be good for my
1984560	1990160	class or my group, and therefore would be good for everyone, or the only reason why other people
1990160	1994080	aren't thinking like me or aren't pursuing the same kind of life as me is because they don't have the
1994080	1999600	same, or because my preferences aren't aren't implemented in society or throughout culture.
1999600	2002960	I mean, yeah, what you said earlier about Mary Harrington's point is interesting. I mean,
2002960	2009120	I saw this firsthand that where I grew up, basically anyone, anyone like, you know,
2009120	2014240	who was remotely sort of academically inclined, you know, went off to some state university,
2014240	2020160	everyone who wasn't, but still had some sort of restlessness or ambition, they joined the military,
2020160	2024160	and then all the guys who were left behind, I mean, there's, you know, not much left for
2024160	2029280	the women there to pick from. And a lot of these guys did grow up without dads or without good
2029600	2034960	sort of male role models around. And yeah, I mean, yeah, what ends up happening often is like,
2034960	2038720	you know, women get, you know, they have children with multiple men, or the men,
2039360	2043600	you know, they have multiple partners and don't interact with their kids. I mean, I, you know,
2043600	2048880	I now have friends that I graduated from high school with who are these guys. And yeah, it's
2048880	2054000	just, it looks very different, right? Like that, the sort of liberation and the belief that, you
2054000	2058880	know, women don't need a man or men shouldn't, you know, women can live the same kind of life as
2058880	2064160	a man. And maybe it's true if you are affluent and you go off to college and you're going to be a
2064160	2070400	young professional career driven person, but if you're just working a menial job and you're,
2070400	2076720	I mean, most people aren't going to derive a ton of satisfaction from the way that they make money.
2076720	2082320	Well, there's a story that you, I remember you telling me maybe about some lady friend that
2082320	2087920	you'd spoken to about, she said that we should be able to move beyond the nuclear family because
2087920	2094240	it's restrictive and constraining. Yeah, yeah, this was someone I graduated from Yale with. We were
2094240	2098960	somehow got on the topic of family and future and this kind of thing. And she was basically telling
2098960	2106160	me that, yeah, marriage is this outdated patriarchal institution and we should society should move
2106160	2112720	beyond it. We should evolve, get past it. And so I asked her, well, how did you grow up? What was
2112800	2119920	your family life situation when you were a child? And she said, I was raised by my mom and my dad
2119920	2126400	and I did have that kind of conventional family. And then I asked her what she planned to do later
2126400	2130480	in her, because she was planning to, she was working at a technology firm, she was going to
2130480	2134000	go to law school, but I asked her in her future when she has a family or if she wanted a family,
2134000	2138080	what would she do? And she said, oh yeah, I do want a family someday and I'll probably get married
2138080	2144320	and have a husband and essentially get married and like partake in this outdated patriarchal
2144320	2151920	institution. And so I was thinking that, okay, you benefited from this age old, ancient sort of
2152560	2159280	patriarchal, but this institution and you plan to carry the benefits of that arrangement forward
2159280	2164240	for your own children. But your official public position is no one should do this, it's outdated,
2164240	2168640	she was sort of denigrating it, trying to downplay it, saying other people shouldn't do this.
2168640	2175200	And to me, it seemed very duplicitous that this clearly marriage has positive benefits. I mean,
2175200	2179520	that was something that I learned when I got to college was almost every single one of my classmates
2179520	2185200	and peers came from two parent families, whereas where I grew up, it was basically zero. And so
2185200	2194160	clearly marriage had some kind of effect here. And yet the place, the group that is the most
2194240	2198320	likely to downplay the benefits of marriage are the most likely to be products of successful
2198320	2205040	marriages under the most likely to form marriages themselves. How come you're not more bitter
2205040	2212800	about your childhood? I mean, I used to be, I used to actually be more angry when I was
2213600	2220640	in my late teens, early 20s. I mean, I think part of it was just getting older. I think just age,
2221200	2227840	things just kind of tend to like burn out in dim over time anyway. And I think the other was just
2227840	2239520	a lot of sort of self focused work, self improvement, trying to get past it and put it all into context
2239520	2247600	and realize that on the one hand, people are responsible for what they do in their lives.
2248160	2257040	But on the other, I mean, to understand the sort of, to understand the genealogy of the ideas that
2257040	2261520	led us to this point, that's been helpful too, to understand that, yes, like day to day we have
2261520	2268640	agency over our lives, but the sort of, there are these decisions and cultural trajectories and
2268640	2273440	all of these other forces that are in place that play a role too. And so, you know, when I start
2273440	2279600	to dig at the root of this of who is responsible for some of these ideas, who promotes the luxury
2279600	2285680	beliefs and so on, and entering into institutions where I can see it, it helps me to just understand
2285680	2292000	it. And I think that sort of settles my anger a bit too. It's very interesting thinking about that.
2292000	2300000	I had a sea traveler on, she's a psychotherapist pushing back very hard against what she calls
2300000	2305680	Instagram therapy, which is identifying everybody as a victim and that they've got trauma and stuff.
2305680	2306240	And she said,
2310640	2315360	remembering that you experience trauma isn't being a victim, making your identity out of it is.
2316240	2320480	Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think that's well put. I mean, I didn't really, I didn't really think
2320480	2324400	of myself as a victim and people didn't call me a victim. I never thought on those terms until
2324400	2328800	I got to college. Before that, it was just day to day life. I mean, it was just, you know,
2328800	2333600	trying to struggling to get by trying to make money trying to whatever living paycheck to
2333600	2338720	paycheck and then later joining the military and you know, I just my, my plate was full later.
2339760	2346400	You know, sort of towards the end of my enlistment before I entered college, I did do a stint in
2346400	2353120	rehab and I talked to therapists and you know, I did sort of address a lot of the issues that
2353600	2359920	I had experienced when I was a kid. And that was helpful too, I think to just sort of contextualize
2359920	2365840	it and also to just sort of be more open with the people I grew up with and close with, you know,
2365840	2370560	my sister and my mom and all these people to just my adoptive family to talk to them about all of
2370560	2377680	this. I mean, that's helpful too. I think there is this, this tendency for young people, young
2377680	2382480	men in particular that, you know, self-sufficiency will solve all your problems to just be completely
2382480	2388560	self-reliant. You don't have to rely on anyone, you know, your, your relationships are sort of
2388560	2395520	peripheral. And I lived that way for a while and it probably did help to sort of, I don't know,
2395520	2400720	led me to equip myself to be, you know, a self-sufficient person. But later, you know, I did
2400720	2406080	realize that actually relationships are important. I mean, I went through the first six years
2407440	2411920	after I left home. I never visited. I never visited for the holidays. I never visited her
2411920	2416400	for any kind of special occasions. I mean, I did visit like, you know, on and off whenever,
2416400	2421840	you know, really whenever it suited my schedule, I was very selfish. But then later, you know,
2421840	2426560	now I make an effort, now I make an effort to do all of those things and realize that actually,
2426560	2429920	you know, all of these things, relationships are more important than you think, especially when
2429920	2435840	you're young, right? There is, there's value there, even if you think there isn't.
2435840	2443040	Yeah, there's a degree of romanticism about monk mode and loan-rangering it. And I think my
2443040	2447440	current theory on this is that monk mode is a great tool, but a bad master.
2448960	2455760	Because if you continue to pray at the altar of it over a long enough amount of time, the reason
2455760	2463520	that you're doing some equivalent of monk mode, right, which is a over-reliance on self-sufficiency,
2463600	2468320	introspection and isolation so that you can focus on making yourself into a better version of you,
2468320	2470960	because quite rightly, there are a lot of distractions out there in the world. And if
2470960	2474560	you're trying to do a ton of self-work, are you going to therapy or you're in rehab,
2474560	2477920	you're probably not going to have the most flourishing social life. It's going to be difficult
2477920	2481520	for you to juggle all of these plates. And if you do try and juggle all of the plates, you're going
2481520	2486480	to restrict your progress in that area. Like committing yourself to one thing or a very narrow
2486480	2491520	band of things is more than, it's not additive, it's multiplicative, right? It allows you to
2491520	2496160	triple down, quadruple down all of your efforts into one very tight area. And I found myself
2496160	2502880	toward the end of my twenties, through my manopause, that I really, really enjoyed monk mode. But I
2502880	2508320	saw, especially for someone that has introverted tendencies, and I get my energy mostly from
2508320	2513840	being on my own a lot of the time, that it started to become more alluring to me than being back out
2513840	2518400	into the world. But the problem with that is the reason that you're doing the monk mode thing or
2518400	2523120	the rehab thing or whatever, is to form yourself into a functional member of society who can then
2523120	2528400	go and reintegrate. And that's the problem that the progress can become addictive to the point
2528400	2534240	where it stops you from doing the thing you're like, the thing that you're doing is sacrificing
2534240	2539680	the thing that you were doing it in order to get. Yeah. Yes. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you sort of mistake
2539680	2545600	the, the means for the end, the end goal, you're sort of, yeah, yeah, it's, I think it's difficult
2545680	2548960	to keep that in mind. I think a lot of people have difficulty with that, especially when you're
2548960	2553680	young, you, like, what, what are your actions attempting to accomplish? What's your overarching
2553680	2558400	goal? You know, Robert Green makes that distinction between tactician versus strategist, right? The
2558400	2561920	tactician is just what's directly in front of you? What do you need to do next? And the strategist is,
2561920	2567040	well, what's all of this for? Like, what are each of those steps trying to get you to? And I think,
2567040	2570000	yeah, when you're young, you just think, oh, I want to make money. And like, money becomes the
2570000	2573200	thing. And it's like, well, what's the money for? Like, what do you want to do with that money
2573200	2577360	when you build up your bank account? What is that the goal is just to have a big number
2577360	2582160	on your balance? Or is it to take care of your loved ones, to have the freedom to be able to
2582160	2587120	interact with people that you care about and to provide and those kinds of things. And I think I,
2587120	2592000	I mean, I kind of came to that realization when I was in my mid 20s, but it wasn't until in my
2592000	2599360	later 20s, really probably right, not until I was about to start grad school, I was like 20, 28,
2599440	2604400	but I really had that realization that, oh, the reason why I'm working so hard and trying to
2604400	2609040	get educated and successful and trying to make money and all these things is so that I could
2609040	2613120	take care of my, my current family, my adoptive family, but then also for if and when I have a
2613120	2618880	family later, we'll say when, that I'll be able to take care of them too in a way that I lacked
2618880	2624480	when I was a kid. And that's what ultimately, all of these things are for. It's not just to
2624480	2629360	whatever, increase the numbers on my social media or on my balance or something like that.
2629920	2635120	So your background, the life that you went through to where you ended up,
2637520	2643200	Air Force? Yeah, Air Force. Air Force, US Air Force, GI Bill, Yale, Cambridge,
2644640	2649520	PhD book, you know, it's going to be an amazing selling book, all the rest of the stuff.
2650160	2657200	What do you attribute that trajectory to, given that your friends with so many of the
2657200	2661120	people that you grew up with that are still, they're the guy, they're that guy with
2661680	2666560	three baby mamas and a bunch of alimony or whatever, and they're in the same town in the
2666560	2673200	same whatever, what was formative or what, what do you attribute the change in you to that the
2673200	2678320	other people didn't? I mean, there are probably, you know, there's a variety of factors. I think one
2678320	2688080	is, you know, you do need to have like a certain amount of like innate drive or ambition in the
2688080	2692800	first place. And that I'm not entirely sure you can, you can, you can drill that into people.
2693760	2697440	So you have to have that sort of raw material in the first place. But one point that I try to
2697440	2702560	make in the book is that things could have very easily gone a different direction. I think having
2702560	2707120	sort of aptitude and drive and ambition, those are necessary but not sufficient that there are a
2707120	2711040	lot of guys I think who are sort of smart and talented and ambitious, but they're just surrounded
2711040	2716800	by chaos and disorder and, you know, lack opportunity or, or they've just been sort of beaten down by
2716800	2720880	life so much that they don't even think to like spot the opportunities that are around you
2722720	2726960	and capitalize on them. And so, so that was there. So I think some of the raw material was
2726960	2731920	probably there. And then the other thing was just making this, you know, kind of halfway impulsive
2731920	2737440	decision when I was 17 to just enlist and get out of my hometown. And I kind of knew that,
2738720	2742320	you know, I, at this point, you know, I'd had two jobs when I was in high school,
2742320	2746400	I was a dishwasher at a restaurant. And then I was a bag boy at a grocery store. And
2746400	2749760	I kind of looked around at my coworkers who were a little older than me. These were guys,
2749760	2753840	you know, this kind of guy in their early to mid twenties, you know, maybe they like some of them
2753840	2757600	like they were like 24, but had a girlfriend in high school. And they were just like kind of creepy,
2757600	2763600	weird stoner guy or the guy who, you know, would ride a dirt bike and, you know, just like smoke
2763600	2767920	a lot of weed in the parking lot and just, you know, kind of aimless and adrift. And I thought
2767920	2773120	like, I, I think now when you're 17 or 18, that's kind of cool to live that life. But when you're
2773120	2778240	24 or 28, like that's kind of pathetic. And even when I was a teenager, I had that thought that,
2778880	2782320	you know, sometimes my friends and I would ask these guys to like get us beer, hook us up with
2782320	2786640	weed or whatever. And, you know, some part of me, I was, I was like happy they were doing it. But
2786640	2791200	on the other hand, I was like, why are you doing this for us, man? Like, what kind of loser is
2791200	2794960	hanging out with a bunch of high schoolers? And I don't want to be like the weird old guy at the
2794960	2803280	high school party when I'm that age. And so, you know, a variety of factors led me to just enlist
2803280	2808480	right away. I barely graduated high school. I mean, I was smart. And that's the other point that I
2808480	2812880	try to make in the book is that a lot of people want to blame the school system or that there's
2812880	2816080	something wrong with teachers or we aren't paying them enough. And so, and maybe some of those things
2816080	2821120	are true, but teachers aren't dumb. Like most teachers get into that profession because they
2821120	2824880	care about kids and they want them to do well. And they're usually pretty observant about like,
2824880	2831440	which kids are sort of curious and academically inclined. And my teachers could see that in me,
2831440	2836960	but I just had no motivation or desire to do well in school. It just wasn't there for me.
2837520	2846480	And so, my teachers were just continually frustrated by me. And so, yeah, I enlist,
2846480	2851360	I get out of there, basic training, I get stationed, I spend some time overseas and sort
2851360	2857040	of have that structure around me. A couple of days ago, I spoke with a mutual friend of ours,
2857040	2861440	Polina Pompliano. And she asked me this question of, when I read your book and I read about what
2861440	2864960	you were like when you were a teenager, when you were in high school, and then I meet you now,
2864960	2871280	like it just doesn't, like there's a disconnect, I don't understand it. And I explained that I was
2871280	2876800	in the Air Force for eight years. Like that's a long time. Like I was in from 17 to 25. And,
2876800	2880400	you know, the book, I kind of like gloss over because it's kind of mind-numbing and boring,
2880400	2884640	but it's like, you know, make your bed, you know, like make sure your uniform is, you know,
2884640	2889120	perfect. Jordan Peterson bootcamp. Exactly. It is kind of like that, especially for the first
2889120	2893120	six months to a year when you're in training, it's like, you're not a, you're not a person,
2893120	2900000	you're just like a cog in this machine of just like, you know, like cleaning and being meticulous
2900000	2905600	about every little aspect of your existence. And I hated it. I hated every second of it.
2907520	2913360	But it was important for me to go through that, to like learn the skills that I kind of lacked
2913360	2917200	when I was growing up of just like, here's how to be an adult, here's how to take care of yourself,
2917200	2920720	here's how to dress properly, and like even basic things, right?
2920720	2924480	What were the most surprising, I think this would be a nice framing, actually,
2926160	2930400	as you move up through the cacophosphere of different social strata,
2931200	2939040	what were the most surprising realizations going from Rob 1.0 to Rob 2.0, which is, I guess,
2939040	2943600	from teenager to being in the Air Force? What were the things where you're like, oh my god,
2943600	2948800	like that's an expectation or a social convention, or that's a way of operating,
2948880	2953200	or it's a belief or whatever? I mean, I think probably one of the bigger ones was
2954320	2958480	just like learning the distinction between like self-discipline and motivation,
2959360	2965920	because I lacked, I really lacked both when I was a teenager. You know, I didn't feel motivated to
2965920	2970000	do well, but I also had, I had no external discipline around me really. I mean, I had it in sort of
2970000	2974400	fits and starts in different periods. It was just a very sort of chaotic early life. But
2975040	2979120	I had no self-discipline, certainly. Like I couldn't impose on myself. It just, you know,
2979120	2983120	I didn't, I didn't have the tools to do that. But then in the military, I learned it that,
2983120	2987200	you know, at first it was imposed from on high that this is how you will do things.
2987200	2990720	And then it gets drilled into you. And then you just learn on your own, like, oh, this is how
2990720	2996000	you get things done is motivation is, you know, so they're the distinction, the motivation is just
2996000	3000000	a feeling. It's like, do I want to do this or not? And if I don't want to do it, I lack the
3000000	3003760	motivation and I'm just not going to do it. Whereas self-discipline is, I'm going to do this
3003760	3008800	regardless of how I feel. And so, you know, for some people, it may make sense in the context of,
3008800	3012880	like, going to the gym, that I don't feel like going to the gym today. But self-discipline is,
3013600	3017040	it doesn't matter how you feel, like, oh, you have a feeling who cares, like, what are your
3017040	3021600	actions? What are you actually going to do now? Ignore those feelings and do what you've set out
3021600	3026960	to do. And so it was like that for my work, for things like, I mean, even showing up to work on
3026960	3033280	time. I mean, it's kind of sad, but I was one of the better workers at my jobs in high school.
3033280	3037360	And even then, I was, like, not on time, half the time, like, it didn't matter. I didn't feel
3037360	3041520	like it. And then the military was, if you don't show up to work on time, you get court-martialed
3041520	3048880	and you go to military prison. That's the life. And once I learned, like, to operate by those
3048880	3054400	standards and those regulations, those policies, that it dawned on me that actually, you know,
3054400	3059520	Jaco has this phrase, discipline equals freedom, that once you sort of outsource all of your decisions
3059520	3065200	to this sort of regimented system, then suddenly, like, life gets better. And you do have more freedom.
3065200	3070480	You have the freedom to think about other things or to direct your attention to certain projects or
3070480	3074880	goals or ideas. And you don't have to live your life in this constant state of chaos of, oh,
3074880	3080240	I don't have any money now, you know, like that, you just, you know, set the set, set the system so
3080240	3083440	that your money goes here. And this is what you're going to do. And you go to work at this time.
3083440	3087200	And this is when you leave. And this is what's, and having that regimented system was really
3087760	3091360	important for me. And now I just, you know, I do it, it's second nature to me, but it took
3091360	3096720	eight years to get there. So yeah, I think those, those kinds of things, discipline was the big one.
3096720	3103040	What do people who didn't grow up in poverty not know about what it's like to grow up in poverty?
3105600	3109600	I mean, I think, I think poverty, poverty is
3110480	3113680	it's an interesting
3115840	3120000	question because I think a lot of people actually attempt to,
3121360	3125280	they attempt to imagine it. I know a lot of people actually who didn't grow up poor, but who
3125280	3131520	at least try to imagine what it would have been like to be poor. And I think like the,
3131520	3135120	the imagination probably isn't too far off from the reality that there are certain things that
3135120	3140640	you want, but maybe you can't get, or if you want a toy or a certain food or a certain thing that,
3141280	3145360	you know, I think poverty now for at least in sort of developed first world countries,
3145360	3152000	very few people are actually starving in the street, but it's more like, you know, I, I want to get,
3153920	3158400	you know, maybe it's like a special occasion and I want to rent a video game at Blockbuster,
3158400	3163120	but that's $6. And we're only going to let you rent a movie because it's $3. Like those kinds
3163120	3167200	of like weird, small things. And you can only go on a special occasion for your birthday or
3167200	3174000	something. It's not like a weekly occurrence. The other thing is like the, I think like the,
3175840	3182000	the social environment is something people don't think about as well, that what family life
3182640	3188960	and communities look like in poor and working class areas now are much different than,
3189200	3194000	than they, than they used to look like. I mean, I cite this statistic in my book about how
3195520	3201760	in the 1960s, 95% of children in the US, regardless of social class, were raised by
3201760	3208080	both of their birth parents. And then by 2005, for the upper class, it had dropped to 85%. So
3208080	3214640	there was a slight dip, but by and large, that's the norm still. Whereas for working class families
3214640	3220800	in the US, working class children, it dropped from 95% to 30%. And that was 2005. My guess is
3220800	3227200	it's dropped a little bit further than that now. And so just to give a sort of a glimpse into this,
3227200	3232800	I mean, there was, I had five close friends growing up in high school. And so there was me
3232800	3238080	sort of raised in foster homes and adopted, but there were divorces and other kinds of drama.
3239040	3244960	I had two friends raised by single moms, one friend raised by a single dad, I had another
3244960	3249360	friend who was raised by his grandma because his dad was in prison and his mom was addicted to drugs.
3249360	3254400	And that's kind of like the normal situation when you go to like, if you go to a high school
3254400	3257680	in one of these areas and just start asking people about their parents or their families,
3257680	3261920	they'll start describing about dads in prison or moms in drugs or, you know, I'm staying with my
3261920	3266640	aunt right now because my mom is in rehab or whatever. Very chaotic. Yeah, it's just total.
3267440	3274560	Yeah, it's just totally chaotic and disorderly. And this is a point that I've made in my writing is
3274560	3281280	that, you know, childhood poverty is not, and again, this is in the context of the US and,
3281280	3287760	you know, first world countries, that childhood poverty is not really very strong predictor
3287760	3293520	of harmful or detrimental outcomes later in life. The correlation is either very weak or
3293520	3300320	not significant at all between growing up poor and growing up to commit crimes or
3300320	3306400	self defeating behaviors, harm, violence, drug addiction, unemployment, all of these kinds of
3306400	3312080	social pathologies, there's a very sort of tenuous connection there. But for childhood instability
3312080	3317920	and those undesirable outcomes, there's a strong and consistent correlation there.
3318800	3324480	And so childhood instability is measured by things like, you know, were you raised by both
3324480	3328720	of your birth parents? Was there a divorce? How many different adults moved in and out of your
3328720	3334400	home? How frequently did you relocate? Basically, how much day to day disorder was there in your
3334400	3339120	life? How much uncertainty was there? And that actually does seem to have a very strong effect
3339120	3345120	on childhood development, on their expectations, on their goals for themselves. And what's
3345200	3350800	interesting is that when researchers control for childhood family income, the link remains
3350800	3355520	strong, it remains significant between instability and outcomes. And so one way to think about this is,
3356880	3362800	you know, if there's a rich family, but there's a lot of drama and chaos and divorce and addiction
3362800	3368560	and domestic issues, a child raised in that environment is much more likely to have detrimental
3368560	3375680	outcomes, more likely to commit crimes or become addicted to substances or just, yeah,
3375680	3381280	have issues, you know, children out of wedlock or multiple with multiple partners versus a child
3381280	3387680	who was raised by two very low income parents who are married, who are very focused on creating a
3387680	3391840	stable and secure life for their kids. And you can kind of see this, I think, with like immigrant
3391840	3398800	families and low income families that haven't really been quite afflicted by a lot of the
3398800	3404960	pathologies that have occurred in the US. And so I think that's important to remember too,
3404960	3409120	it's that yes, there's this poverty component, but there's also just this kind of, sometimes I
3409120	3413440	wonder if poverty is even the right word for the way that I grew up. I think squalor is probably
3413440	3417680	a more accurate term is like, you know, there was a bit of that material impoverishment, but it was
3417760	3426400	more just people like living in a very kind of ugly and almost like masochistic way of just,
3427040	3433840	you know, careless and impulsive and, you know, sort of drug addled.
3433840	3439680	What's the mechanism that you think is causing that to happen? What is it about, it's so universal
3439680	3448160	that this unstable, disorganized upbringing, regardless of class or material wealth,
3448960	3454560	seems to have such negative impacts predictively down, what do you think's the mechanism there?
3454560	3461200	I mean, you know, I probably some of it would be genetics, but I'm not sold that it's 100%.
3461200	3467040	All right, people that are quick to anger, externalizing behavior as parents give the
3467040	3470640	raw materials of externalizing behavior to kids, right? I think that's really good.
3470640	3473440	I think that's like one piece of it, but I think that...
3473440	3474800	Robert Ploman Rains Supreme.
3474800	3479200	Yeah, exactly. And I think, yeah, that would be the Robert Ploman answer,
3480640	3487120	you know, but I do think that that can't explain 100% of it because, you know, if you just,
3487120	3492160	so for example, if you just look at white Americans over time, like all of the same things
3492160	3496720	have occurred across social classes that actually, you know, 50, 60 years ago,
3497680	3502240	I mean, I'll give you an example just for my adoptive family. So my adoptive family
3502240	3508480	are basically white working class people on my mother's side. And so my grandparents,
3510240	3513040	you know, they were, you know, they grew up basically during the Great Depression
3513680	3517360	and they got, you know, but they got married, you know, my grandfather and my grand...
3517360	3520880	They would tell me this story about how my grandfather asked my grandmother to marry him.
3520880	3527280	And I think he was 18 or 19 and she was like 17. And she, you know, they were just like two,
3527280	3532080	the only two young people in this town. And, you know, and she was like, I'll marry you,
3532080	3536800	but you have to stop smoking, stop drinking, stop gambling. And he was like, done and done,
3536800	3538640	they got married and they had a 60 plus...
3538640	3539360	Let's have sex.
3539360	3543760	Yeah, exactly. Well, yeah, they had, I think they had four or five kids.
3543760	3544480	Lots of sex.
3544480	3550800	Yeah. And they were married for 60 plus years, no issues. I'm sure they had
3550800	3554960	issues, but like, you know what I mean? And then they had four kids, all four kids divorced.
3556640	3560960	And, you know, I just, you know, they, they had married, they did get married,
3560960	3564400	but then they ended up getting divorced. You know, some of them had, you know,
3564400	3569520	kids, step kids, that kind of thing. Now, I'm a member of the next generation and I'm seeing
3569520	3574320	my cousins and it's like, it's not even marriage. It's just like, oh, like they hooked up and had
3574320	3578560	a kid, but he hasn't spoken to his kid in, you know, three years and, you know, so that's what
3578560	3582160	it looks like now. And I don't think the genetics in this family lineage changed much.
3582160	3585840	It was the social environment, it's the incentives, it's the denigration of marriage.
3585840	3589920	It's, and I don't even, you know, people will point to economic factors, but my grandparents
3589920	3593760	were very, they were probably poorer than, they're definitely poorer than my cousins now,
3593760	3598400	you know, like they could not afford the things that my same age, you know, 30 year old cousins
3598400	3603920	could afford. So it wasn't an economic issue. I think a lot of it was just cultural of what
3603920	3607760	are your expectations? I think a lot of it has to do with a lot of the stuff that you and I have
3607760	3612080	talked about and you speak about on your podcast around incentives, around sex and romance and
3612080	3618400	dating and just, yeah, in the 19, what is it, the 1940s, 1950s, my grandparents generation,
3618400	3622560	it was like, you know, if you wanted to have sex, you had to like live a certain kind of life,
3622560	3629280	exactly. And that was, that was just the reality then. And now it's, it's completely different.
3629280	3635280	And I've presented this thought experiment before, I think I posted this on, on back when it was
3635280	3641280	still called Twitter, which was if you traveled back to 1945, just got in a time machine and walked
3641280	3647280	out in the post war era, and you said, and you know, very soon, I think it was 1960 when the
3647280	3651760	birth control pill was invented, you say very soon, it's going to be this magical technology,
3651760	3657920	the birth control pill. So contraceptives will be widely available. Abortion will be, you know,
3657920	3662960	it'll be more accessible, definitely certainly than it is now. So you'll have, you know, the,
3662960	3669520	all of these reproductive options before you. Do you think in the future, there will be more
3669520	3675040	children born out of wedlock or fewer? Do you think that there will be more abortions or fewer?
3675040	3680400	Do you think there will be more children raised in foster homes or orphanages living in chaos and
3680400	3685680	squalor, more or less? And I think, you know, almost everyone that you speak to in 1945,
3685680	3691200	you present this survey, I think almost every one of them would say less, they would say fewer.
3691200	3696720	And then, you know, I, but that's not the case. It was very much the opposite of that, that I
3696720	3702160	think even these technologies and, you know, and the culture and everything sort of went in a,
3702160	3705200	in a very different direction than I think people had predicted.
3705840	3713440	Mary Eberstadt came on the show. And Adam and Eve and the pill revisited a new version of her
3713440	3719760	old book. Fantastic. Just so great. And it's true, man. Like, you know, we look back, and it's kind
3719760	3725440	of cool in the red pill, manosphere, even in the EP world, you know, the social psychology world,
3725440	3736720	for people to almost laugh, snigger at how rudimentary the thinking was in the 1960s that
3736720	3743200	introducing birth control would result in better outcomes in terms of abortion, better outcomes
3743200	3749680	in terms of out of wedlock births. But who then would have been able to predict that that was
3749680	3754640	what was going to happen? You're talking like a fourth order effect, right? Like, okay, so you're
3754640	3758960	going to decrease shotgun weddings because the onus is going to go from the male that accidentally
3758960	3764800	impregnated to the woman who quote unquote chose, right? It went from a man's mistake to a woman's
3764800	3768240	option. And you go, okay, right. And then, and then what's going to happen to that? And what's
3768240	3773680	going to happen to that? But it's like, it's so far down the line. I was talking to Scott Galloway.
3774480	3778880	And, you know, he was talking about the predictive power of stuff in the past. And he was saying,
3778880	3784320	you know, he'd looked through, combed through some research about the Great Depression and had
3784320	3789680	looked for anybody. Anyone predict this? It's like the year before the Great Depression in the 20s.
3790560	3795680	No one, nothing, not a Cassandra in sight. And yet in retrospect, you go,
3796880	3802800	how could no one have seen this coming? You know, hindsight is a wonderful thing with regards to
3802800	3808080	that. One question that I've got that I think is kind of interesting is, so squalor, your word,
3808720	3819360	uh, up until the age of 16, 17, 17, until the age of 17, that should set a pretty low
3819360	3824880	hedonic threshold, right? That you're in a nice air conditioned room, and your jeans fit and don't
3824880	3828480	have holes in, and you're not worrying about whether or not you can pay for the Uber to get
3828480	3836080	from here to the airport. How have you found your ability to, uh, hedonically adapt over time?
3836160	3843200	Like, can you recall that as an anchor for your quality of life? Or does it almost seem
3843200	3847680	like it's someone else that lived that? That's, oh, that's an interesting question. Um,
3849120	3853840	I guess it's, it's a bit of both. I mean, it's, it's a day to day, I think. I don't really, yeah,
3853840	3858960	I don't really reflect in that way. You know, you just sort of live your life. But when I reflect
3858960	3862400	back and when I think about it and I realize, you know, there are those moments where like,
3862400	3866800	wow, like I can do this thing that I couldn't have done, you know, even, even after I was in the
3866800	3872480	middle, I mean, the, I think the pay structures probably changed a bit when I enlisted in 2007.
3872480	3878160	I was, you know, I think the, the, I was making like $1,200 a month was the, the pay. And so I
3878160	3883440	couldn't afford a belt, you know, like, it was like small little things like that. Like, you know,
3883440	3887120	once I cover, you know, because I moved, yeah, once I moved off base, I got this house with my
3887120	3890640	friends, but you know, you have to pay like first, yeah, it's so funny now, like it doesn't matter
3890640	3893360	to me because I can, you know, I can, I have money, but back then it was like,
3894000	3897680	like, like panicking. I was like, you have to pay the first month and the last month's rent up front.
3898320	3902320	And then it's like a security deposit. And then it's this and then you have to, and then like gas
3902320	3906160	to commute back and, and all of these kinds of things and calculating all of this. And it's like,
3906160	3910480	oh, well, I guess I can't wear a belt for a couple of weeks and come on next paycheck. It's like that.
3911200	3916880	It sucks. And, and so, you know, so there are times like that where I'm like, oh, I could just buy
3916880	3922000	this without thinking about it. And that that part is nice. So I think it is that kind of,
3922720	3927520	you know, like happiness researchers will do this. What is it like, they have terms for this,
3927520	3933520	it's like life, life satisfaction versus, I think they may just call it happiness,
3933520	3937840	where like happiness is like your, your actual affective state in the moment day to day and how
3937840	3941600	much positive versus negative emotion are you experiencing subjectively throughout the day
3941600	3944480	or the week or whatever. And then there's the life satisfaction component, which is
3944480	3948320	basically when you step back and view your life as a whole, how satisfied are you? And
3948320	3951280	those two things are correlated, but they're not quite the same in some ways.
3951280	3956320	I think parents often report much lower levels of happiness, but higher levels of life satisfaction.
3956320	3959760	Yes. And, and I think in that regard, it's like, you know, my happiness,
3959760	3963520	I don't know if it's actually changed much. Maybe there is a bit of that hedonic adaptation where,
3963520	3966800	you know, 15 years ago, it was like, oh, I can, you know, I can go to Wendy's,
3966800	3971520	cool, like I'm happy. Whereas now it's, you know, something else, but, but ultimately that
3971520	3975280	hasn't changed. But the life satisfaction, I'm sure is, is much higher that like, oh, I've had
3975280	3980640	a few accomplishments and I can afford things. I don't have to think about money as much anymore.
3980640	3985840	And so yeah, I think there is that. And yeah, and also like reminiscing too, like when I talked
3985840	3989440	to my sister or some of my, my old friends from high school and just sort of thinking about those
3989440	3993520	days, it's like, you know, I do feel a bit better now about my life compared to what I was.
3993520	3999840	I was talking to a friend and they were asking me stuff about my childhood and my memory is really
3999840	4009280	patchy from my childhood. It's not fantastic, especially not sort of pre 10. And I said,
4009280	4015120	look, like what, what do you remember? I said, well, I remember a good bit because of my sister,
4015120	4019120	because we'll prompt each other about that. Oh, do you remember that? Oh my God. Yeah,
4019120	4024160	we did do that thing. And we were in that car or we got stuck in the, the mud or whatever, right?
4024720	4031600	And yeah, there's a degree where I wonder how much is just one good chat GPT prompt away
4032160	4036960	from me, you know, opening out into this really beautiful answer about some insight or whatever
4036960	4044400	some experience that I had as a kid. But yeah, George Mack, my friend, once a month lies in bed
4044400	4048240	before he wakes up for 10 minutes and imagines what it would be like to live with no arms or legs.
4048240	4053200	That's one of his favorite meditations among a bunch of other weird ones. So he's trying to
4053280	4057360	dial up contrast as much as possible. Think about all of the challenges that I would have
4057360	4060320	to face. Think about what this day is going to entail. Think about all of the things that
4060320	4064160	would be difficult for me. Think about how grateful I would be if only I could just,
4064160	4070080	you know, wash my own back if only I could brush my own teeth if only I could do these things.
4070080	4073680	So what he's trying to do is give himself gratitude for the things that he takes for
4073680	4079280	granted that are very normal. Now, the interesting thing with your example is that you don't need
4079280	4084960	to imagine what it would be like to live in squalor because you did. But the way that our
4086400	4090960	sense of self works, you know, what is it? Every seven years, every cell in your body has turned
4090960	4097120	over. So there isn't even, you're like the two ship of these three, three, three ship of theseus
4097120	4103120	is away from the person that you were then. And even for me now, being in Austin for two years,
4103120	4108240	I went back home for Christmas. And it's like, it's kind of like a fever dream. I'm being back in
4108240	4113600	this place that I know so well, but I'm different, but I'm not. And then I find triggers, environmental
4113600	4118000	triggers causing me to fall back into other different ways of thinking and stuff like that.
4118800	4124720	So I was interested in whether or not basically you have been able to lock in a degree of gratitude,
4125520	4129680	like relativistic gratitude, I suppose, based on where you came from to where you are now.
4130320	4134880	But it's a permanent, a permanent battle. Like in some regards, from a poverty perspective,
4135280	4138320	you were a guy who was born with no arms or legs and then grew them.
4144320	4148800	That's right. If I think about what it was like back then, and I compare it to now,
4148800	4154560	of course, things are much better for me. And yeah, I mean, it would be, I think,
4154560	4160240	shameful to be anything other than completely grateful and just full of gratitude for-
4160240	4162080	And proud as well, I would like to think.
4162080	4166880	Yeah. I mean, that's a weird one. I think that's one of the things that, in the book,
4166880	4172240	I point this out, that when you don't really grow up with parents and you don't really,
4172240	4176960	I mean, because I grew up in foster homes before, I think there's the developmental
4176960	4181440	window where if you don't really receive positive feedback, I think I just like,
4182000	4186720	I receive compliments in a very weird way where it's very hard for me to accept it.
4186720	4192160	It's a skill. It's a real skill, man. Who is it that I gave someone a compliment?
4193280	4198800	Fuck, I can't remember who it was. I gave somebody a compliment and I've never seen
4198800	4201280	anyone. I wish I could remember who it was, but it would probably be a good idea that I
4201280	4206000	couldn't call them out in any case. Dude, it's like the worst way that I've ever seen anyone
4206000	4209920	take a compliment. Just, you know, you say this thing that you think is a nice gift that you're
4209920	4213600	giving somebody, and even giving compliments is a skill that I've had to learn because I'm
4213600	4216160	doing something that's nice for somebody else is a nice thing to do.
4217680	4222480	Gwinda. It was fucking Gwinda. It was on an episode that I did recently, and I was like,
4222480	4227040	dude, I fucking adore your writing. I adore your sub-stack. You've got two bucks coming out.
4227040	4230320	I can't wait to read them. I'm fired up every single time I speak to you on the podcast. I
4230320	4234080	love it. It's like a fugue state we drop into for two hours. It's brilliant.
4234800	4240560	I just saw his face. People can go watch the episode. It's very charming. It's very charming
4240560	4245520	because obviously he holds himself to a high standard and stuff like that. But you see this
4245520	4252800	guy go like, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's hard. It's very charming. Well, the other day I had this,
4252800	4258880	this interaction with one of my friend's mothers, and you know, she was like very high energy,
4258880	4263600	and she was like, oh, you know, Rob, I love your writing. And now it's like, I love your sub-stack,
4263600	4268160	and I've watched you on modern wisdom. It's like, it's so great. And at first I was like,
4268160	4272240	you know, oh, that's nice. Thank you. You know, trying to like change the subject. I just like,
4272240	4275040	I feel like all these compliments, and I just feel uncomfortable. I'm like, that's really
4275040	4278320	nice of you. Thank you so much. And then she's like, no, really, she's like, did you really get a
4278320	4281600	PhD from Cambridge? Because that's amazing. And then like, I started to walk away feeling like,
4281600	4284480	damn, I feel pretty good about myself actually. Like, can I have you hung around all the time?
4284480	4289040	Eventually, I was like, you know, I was suddenly getting this like really positive mom energy.
4289040	4292960	And I was like, this is great. Like, actually, but it took a second, right? At first I was like,
4292960	4296480	you know, just fell into that sort of default, like, oh, very kind of you to say, thank you so
4296480	4300560	much. And then she kept going with it. And I'm like, wow, this is a really nice slate.
4301120	4306560	You're like, kind of the equivalent of a really, obviously overweight person
4306560	4310880	who can't just go in the gym and do a little bit. It's like, hey, we've got to shift 250 pounds.
4310880	4314320	You need to stay on that treadmill for another hour, Mr. And then you finish and you're like,
4314320	4319280	oh, wow, like, exactly. Exactly. Exactly. There's like a crushing weight of compliments that you
4319280	4326480	need. But that's something I'd loved. I've got, who wrote No More Mr. Nice Guy? Robert Glover.
4326480	4330400	Thank you. I've got Dr. Robert Glover coming on the show soon. I'm very excited to speak to him.
4330400	4338560	And I'd love to talk about the skill of both accepting and giving compliments. I think that
4338560	4345360	that's a really underrated skill. The ability to give an earnest compliment and to graciously,
4345360	4349600	but honestly receive it. Right. Skill that no one really ever talks about.
4349600	4353600	That is interesting. Yeah, I think from, at least my impression is it's actually
4353600	4356640	easier to deliver a compliment than to receive it. Way easier.
4356640	4360160	Because you can be sincere about it. Like, you can honestly show your appreciation if you enjoy
4360160	4365840	something to tell someone. But yeah, I've, yes, seen, this seems to be a common pattern that
4365840	4374560	people have difficulty with receiving them. More so with guys maybe, than girls, although even then.
4374560	4380960	That's an interesting one. Because with women, for sure, they hide ambition. They downplay success
4380960	4385680	and stuff like that. Certainly, female to female communication, I think there is
4386640	4391600	more opaqueness and more fuckery that goes on with regards to that. If a guy thinks that you've
4391600	4395520	done something shit, they go, dude, that was lame. Whereas it might be couched in some other
4395520	4400320	sort of language from a woman. Yeah, that'd be interesting. I'd love someone to look at
4400880	4405120	since the versus insincerity compliments from comparing men and women. That'd be a fascinating
4405120	4410000	study. This morning, I was, I was prepping a newsletter. It'll go out tomorrow. You know,
4410000	4413280	I do like a three, you know, interesting findings. Everyone needs to go to Rob's
4413360	4416960	substack and subscribe. It's outstanding. Thank you, man.
4416960	4420960	And I shamelessly repurpose at least one thing every like couple of weeks.
4420960	4423840	You know, I think like, well, the findings deserved as wide an audience as possible,
4423840	4428800	but this was an interesting one. It'll go out where, so this was a study from 1988. I'd be
4428800	4431840	curious to see, like, I don't, I couldn't find anything more recent, but essentially,
4431840	4438960	they broke down by gender, the domain of, of, of where people deliver their compliments. And so
4438960	4443920	for women, it was, when women compliment women versus when men compliment men,
4443920	4447280	what are they complimenting? For women, it was mostly appearance. It was like something like
4447280	4453200	60% of the compliments were about appearance. And then it was like 15% about possessions and 10%
4453200	4458480	about accomplishments and that kind of thing. Whereas, so it was mostly appearance based for
4458480	4463040	women when they're complimenting one another. Whereas for men, it was mostly based on
4463920	4469840	accomplishments. Most of their compliments to one another were about accomplishments.
4469840	4476720	And so one thing that I would wonder is like, maybe it's, I wonder if it's kind of easier or,
4476720	4481280	or more difficult depending on, so, so I would imagine like for women when they receive compliments
4481280	4486320	about their appearance, because it seems to be the most common domain that they would receive
4486320	4489680	those quite easily because they're used to it. Whereas for accomplishments, that makes them feel
4489760	4493280	uncomfortable in some way. And if you're a guy, if I go to you and I'm like,
4493280	4498000	dude, you're looking buff. Tell me about, tell me about how good my last newsletter was.
4498000	4501600	Yeah, yeah, yeah. I wonder if like we would feel more uncomfortable when it's something
4501600	4507680	other than, than the target. That's so fascinating. And yet again, it shows just how
4507680	4515040	people's, people's behaviors zeroes in on the most salient parts of each sex's characteristics.
4515760	4520080	So women are complimenting the most important thing to the opposite sex.
4520080	4523760	Men are complimenting the most important thing to the opposite sex. The same thing
4523760	4529280	happens with derogation as well. You know, if there's an argument between a guy and a woman
4529280	4532800	on the internet, the woman's going to say he's got small dick energy and the guy's going to call her
4532800	4536800	a slag, right? That's it. It's like, I'm going to derogate your chastity. I'm going to derogate
4536800	4541280	your sexual prowess. I'm going to say that you're not as competent or as rich or as good looking
4541600	4545200	or as like successful as you think you are. And I'm going to say that you're like fatter
4545200	4550000	older and uglier than you are. Why? Well, those are the most important things that you have with
4550000	4554800	regards to social currency. And these are the same people who will throw these sorts of insults
4554800	4560480	around like, you know, Greta Thunberg accused Andrew Tate of having small dick energy. Like
4560480	4565520	it's, I think it's the third most liked tweet of all time or something like that. I think she's,
4566400	4571040	I think she's in the top 10 twice. And I think Tate features in the top 10
4572000	4576640	twice or three times and at least maybe one or two of those are his interactions
4576640	4579440	with Greta Thunberg. So kind of, I don't know, like,
4581440	4585440	he's like the Michael Jackson to her Janet Jackson or something like very, very successful when
4585440	4591840	they get together. Yeah, I think that, yeah, the same people who would probably endorse
4591920	4598960	like some form of gender blank slate egalitarianism or deny that there are any sort of biologically
4598960	4603280	based sex differences will still sort of target those areas of insecurity.
4603280	4607680	It's the same as the Harvard Extension School thing. Right. Yeah. Yeah.
4607680	4612240	Yeah. So yeah, that's, yeah. So if, um, yeah, if you're, you know, a very progressive person,
4612240	4615760	but then a man is annoying you online, you'll immediately start telling him that he's, you
4615760	4619440	know, a virgin or he's, you know, exactly fucking incel like, oh, okay.
4619440	4624080	Well, if you throw that debate around, speaking of that,
4624800	4628720	Alexander Datesyke just put a new study out. Did you see this one? He hasn't released the
4628720	4631760	details, but he's capturing the data at the moment on it through a Google form.
4632960	4642080	It's so funny. He's put videos up asking participants to rank the attractiveness of
4642080	4646480	different red pill influences. Okay. So there's the guys from Fresh and Fit,
4647280	4652080	who else is in there? I don't know. There's like a bunch of other people that are in there.
4652080	4656880	And, uh, it's got the replies are so funny. I gotta look at it. So it's on, it's on Twitter.
4656880	4660320	Like these, these, correct. Him mining for the data is on Twitter. The results aren't,
4660320	4662960	he's, he's currently, he only put it out yesterday, I think. I gotta look at this.
4662960	4670000	And, um, dude, I have to, is he on there? I'm not, I'm not, and he's not. He went like more
4670000	4679360	kind of like another big names within that world or whatever. But, um, he is, Alex has an ability,
4680480	4688320	I don't think I've ever, ever seen you get into a spat on Twitter. I don't think I,
4688320	4691920	I don't think you've ever had a back and forth, despite having like hundreds of thousands of
4691920	4699680	people that follow you. Uh, Gwinda likes to kind of, he's more like a hit man. So he'll sit
4699680	4706320	upon a ridge and look out and then he'll like fire something. And it's like AOC. It'll be
4706320	4712160	like a single reply to AOC with 500 likes from him. And then nothing, he won't tweet for another
4712160	4719760	week. Honestly, he pops out of the wilderness looks and he's like, adjust the site fires
4719760	4727280	and then leaves. Um, but I mean, Alexander goes in with incels, incel co, uh, that account that
4727280	4733200	I think is the admin of the incels.co thing. He's back and forth with like anyone, like egg and
4733200	4737920	non accounts. Like if he sees, and you've got this essay and it's really well written, but, um,
4738880	4743840	his capacity, he's kind of like the destiny of dating research. You know, he's just got this
4743840	4747760	predisposition that's very good for being able to put up for anyone that doesn't know who we're
4747760	4751280	talking about. He's been on the show, Alexander dates, I think it's like at Alex dates, I gone
4751280	4756720	on Twitter. Just look, whatever day this goes out on, look at who he's going tweets and replies
4756720	4760880	and have a look at how many people he's arguing with. And I promise you, they'll just be mountains,
4760880	4764960	like tons and tons and tons. And it's no one, it's nobody. And then sometimes it's a somebody, but
4765760	4768960	I think he's performing a much needed service because I don't have the patience for that.
4769600	4774560	I think like, you know, professors and researchers and podcast, like just people who have like a
4774560	4780400	million things to do. And I think like, but he, he's, he's doing it very well and he's building
4780400	4784320	an audience this way. And I think, you know, it's, it's, it's, he's channeling his, his knowledge
4784400	4789200	and his research toward productive ends. And you know, I think it, someone should be engaging
4789200	4795280	with a lot of these like black pills, you know, it's a fucking high price. Do you see that we got
4795280	4804880	lumped into, uh, uh, we, we got given a name. Oh, we did me, you, William Costello and Alexander
4804880	4810240	dates, like, and it's the academic manosphere. Okay. Good company. I like it. I think that's,
4810320	4814240	that's a pretty good, I was in there. Yeah. I think so. Okay. I think you were. It was a long
4814240	4817840	time ago on this day. It was like maybe months ago and I did, I forgot to send it to you. But
4817840	4821600	yeah, the academic, the academic manosphere types, it was used as a slur, but I was like,
4821600	4826240	yo, if you want this to be a slur, make it less cool of a name. Like it's a fucking dope. I want
4826240	4831520	to be a part of the academic manosphere. Yeah. Yeah. I got, I got lumped in a couple of years ago
4831520	4836560	with it was some like, you know, like someone was like trying to create like a league of the IDW.
4836560	4840000	This was back when the IDW was still, I think it was still a thing or it was kind of on the
4840080	4846320	way down. It was like 2020, 2021. And yeah, I was like in the minor leagues. It was like, you know,
4846320	4852080	they're heavy hitters, Eric Weinstein. Yeah. And then it was back then, I don't know what,
4852080	4855120	I have like 10,000 followers or something. And it was like, that would have been probably after
4855120	4859120	your university of Austin thing, maybe around about that time. It was before then even, it was
4859120	4864560	like, you know, I think you and I had just met and it was like still kind of early days. And I
4864560	4868320	was looking at this, I'm like, I don't want to, you know, like, I like some of the people who
4868320	4871200	are, were whatever. I don't know if it's not really still a thing anymore, but I like some of
4871200	4874720	those people are like, I'm not really in this IDW thing. Like, I thought it was kind of, yeah.
4875280	4882000	So talking about you moving into the real, you know, upper stratosphere, troposphere of
4882720	4890000	class moving through your time in the Air Force. What about when you got to Yale
4890560	4895200	first and then Cambridge? What was some of the conventions that really sort of stood out to
4895280	4900880	you? Because I think this has informed a lot of your ability to sit back and look at these
4900880	4905920	dynamics and go, oh, isn't that interesting? Because you have an anchoring bias to be able to
4905920	4910400	compare it to. You're like, I saw this thing, and then I saw this, and then I saw that. So I'm
4910400	4914960	actually able to observe these dynamics for what they are, rather than kind of, I get to see code
4914960	4918080	rather than matrix as opposed to have only ever grown up inside of the matrix.
4919040	4926880	Yeah, yeah. I mean, I, so yeah, I arrived on campus 2015 as a, you know, mature student, and
4928480	4932480	Asian, so looking like a normal age student. I think I had the beard back then. So I had like a
4932480	4935680	full beard, you know, so this is like a very common thing with vets, where like, because you have to
4935680	4940320	shave every day, and they like inspect you to make sure it's like, it better be like this morning
4940320	4947280	you shave, not last night kind of thing. And so as soon as I got on like, you know, I didn't work
4947280	4951520	out, dude, I think I gained like 20 pounds. Like it was the first semester was bad, where I was like,
4951520	4955840	I was like, I don't have to work out anymore. Yeah, it was really nice. And then like, I don't,
4956640	4961840	I like looked in the mirror, like six months in, I was like, I gotta take this. But the first six
4961840	4968160	months, it was glorious. And so, but yeah, I looked older, I was older, and you know, the
4968160	4973040	students, some of them would crack jokes about 21 Jump Street, you know, like that kind of thing.
4973040	4980160	And yeah, it was like the first couple of months or so, nothing really unusual. But then
4981920	4987440	I saw this very strange, you know, I mentioned before, like witness the kind of birth of this new
4988720	4995840	politically correct movement where a professor had written an email, essentially defending
4995840	5000320	freedom of expression on campus later became known as the Yale Halloween Halloween costume
5000320	5007360	controversy on campus where this was October, the Yale administration released this email,
5007360	5012560	basically telling the students to, you know, not engage in any cultural appropriation, don't wear
5012560	5018000	costumes that would be offensive to these groups. And then one of the faculty members on campus
5018000	5022000	basically wrote an email just to her students in her residential college saying like, do we really
5022000	5026560	need the administration interfering in our lives? Like, you're all adults, I trust that if you wear
5026560	5030080	things that maybe you don't other people don't like, you guys can just work it out amongst
5030080	5035280	yourselves, essentially defending freedom of expression. And in response, hundreds of students
5035280	5039760	marched around campus, calling for her to be fired. And later for her husband, Nicholas Christakis,
5039760	5044640	to be fired, saying that she was racist, she was defending cultural appropriation, these students
5044640	5050720	claim they didn't feel safe on campus. And they were using this kind of language, which I think
5050720	5054080	like now all of this stuff is kind of spilled out of the universities and we're all kind of familiar
5054080	5059600	with all this sort of victimhood stuff. But back then I was just completely like flummoxed
5059600	5065040	that, you know, was like, we're in danger, we, you know, they caused us pain, suffering, we're
5065040	5071040	under immense harm. You know, this is like a emblematic of, you know, broader systemic forces
5071040	5075040	that are working against. And I'm looking at these students and like, I know for a fact,
5075040	5080000	a lot of them were the sons and daughters of millionaires. I remember asking one
5080080	5086080	young female student, basically, like, can you explain, like, why is this offensive?
5086640	5092800	I don't understand. And she basically told me I was too privileged to understand why, you know,
5092800	5099440	why Erica Christakis' email was offensive. Wow. And, you know, she was like some white girl who
5099440	5104640	like went to private boarding school and like grew up in a rich neighborhood, but she was an activist
5104640	5109840	and whatever. And so she was like kind of the, is it the Titiana McGrath, like that archetype,
5110640	5116160	except like, you know, went to Yale and everything. And so, and that was like an interesting thing,
5116160	5122240	too, was like, on campus, the whole identity politics idea was that if you are a member of
5122240	5128880	these certain sociological categories, then therefore you are conferred legitimacy to opine
5128880	5134400	on all of the social ills of the world and how to fix them and so on. But then the students also
5134720	5140320	placed a great deal of importance on lived experience, you know, and if you live through
5140320	5144800	something in your life, then therefore you're able to speak about certain things, you're
5144800	5149840	an authority on those matters. But those two things seem to be, to me, contradictory that,
5149840	5153280	you know, does it matter what you live through in your life or does it just matter like what
5153280	5160160	you, what category you belong to? Isn't it interesting that you had 17-year
5160160	5166160	squalor legitimacy when it comes to lived experience, but the number one thing which is
5166160	5171600	ignored is class? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. And it was, I mean, yeah, they,
5173840	5178320	because there are so few people who had my kind of background on campus and because so few
5178880	5182160	students and graduates of these kinds of universities ever encounter it, it just
5182160	5186720	isn't on their radar that they don't even think about. I mean, what's really interesting was
5186800	5190800	that Yale is located in New Haven, which is a really low income kind of blue collar town.
5191360	5194800	But, you know, they call it the Yale bubble where, you know, the students would only stick
5194800	5201200	around in this very sort of, you know, enclosed area. But I lived off campus in an apartment
5201200	5206720	downtown. And so I would walk through like a lot of poverty, a lot of squalor, a lot of addiction.
5207760	5211600	And, you know, having, you know, 20 minutes earlier heard some student talk about how they
5211600	5218320	were oppressed. And then I'd see, you know, real poverty and real suffering. And I was just very
5218320	5222320	difficult for me to sort of reconcile those things. And eventually, like, at first, I tried to be
5222320	5227600	sympathetic and tried to understand these, you know, these grievances and the students and the
5227600	5233200	graduates and the faculty and all these, you know, and then eventually I was like, these people have,
5233200	5236800	you know, they just completely don't understand, they have no connection with it whatsoever. And
5237440	5244000	some of it I think is legitimately malicious and duplicitous. I would see, for example,
5246320	5250960	people claim that investment banks were emblematic of capitalist oppression
5251760	5256320	and say that, you know, these are just, you know, these horrible entities. And then those
5256320	5261520	same people would be at a recruitment session for Goldman Sachs like two weeks later. And I think,
5261520	5267280	like, you know, that to be was like, that was a calculated move. Like, and what I mean by that
5267280	5271840	is like, I don't want to work for them. Yeah, like if they can basically eliminate their rivals
5271840	5275840	for these prestigious internships, then all the better for them. And so I think some of it was
5275840	5280960	tactical and calculated. But I think for a lot of people, it's just, you know, their hearts are
5280960	5285280	in the right place, or they're not really thinking that much about it. And so yeah, this was,
5285520	5291440	yeah, it was very strange. And then the other thing is, so this is funny, I never knew my
5291440	5298720	father growing up, and I didn't know who he was or anything about him. And it was only recently,
5298720	5305920	I took a 23 and me and got the results and found that my father was Mexican. And I went through,
5305920	5309600	I called up our mutual friend, Rizib Khan, I was like, Hey, can you look at this with me and like
5309600	5314080	help explain? He's like, Yeah, your dad was like, you know, Mexican, he was like, Indigenous from
5314080	5318080	North America with some Spanish ancestries, like that's like a perfect, he's like, you grew up in
5318080	5323360	LA, man, like, what did you expect? And like, okay, so my dad was Mexican. But so when I was at Yale,
5323360	5327520	before I had this information, I was hanging out in a dorm room with some students. And it was a
5327520	5332000	friend of mine, who was a Mexican guy. And, you know, he, he was not like, you know, he wasn't
5332000	5336960	an activist, he wasn't like, woke or whatever. But I took a sombrero off the wall and put it on my
5336960	5340880	head. And he was joking around, but he said something like, Hey, you know, that's cultural
5340880	5344400	appropriation, you can't wear that sombrero. I was like, Oh, my bad, you know, joking around. And
5344400	5349200	then once I got these results back, I was like, wait a minute, I'm allowed to wear that sombrero.
5349200	5353760	I could wear that sombrero. Get me a poncho, get me some fajitas. And then, and then the next
5353760	5358160	that I had, but the next that I had was like, this just shows how like how stupid the whole thing
5358160	5363200	is in the first place, right? Like, someone from my background who didn't know my father, who could
5363200	5367440	have been like, I could have believed like if I had believed in the cultural appropriation thing,
5367440	5371840	I could have bought into it. And now what am I supposed to think? Now that I have these DNA
5371840	5376480	test results. And then I, you know, just like the whole idea of like breaking people down into
5376480	5381200	like these ethnic categories, and they are or are not allowed to partake in this activity or that
5381200	5387840	or the other. Like, when when there are people out there who actually don't know who their fathers
5387840	5392640	are, or don't know, they don't even know what cultural appropriation means. I just think like,
5392640	5396960	our our attention and our resources and our time are spent on such such frivolous nonsense.
5396960	5399760	But is it the tyranny of small differences? What's that thing?
5400560	5406720	Yeah, the narcissism of small differences. That's it. Yeah, that the smaller the differences between
5406720	5411520	people, the bigger that they're blown up to be. When you have this relatively homogenous group of
5411520	5417200	people at Yale, it's all to do with you can't speak to her like that. It's like, why? Like, she's
5418480	5424880	she's exactly the same as you, just that one grandmother's half African American or something.
5424880	5429840	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And and everyone is from like the top, probably the top decile of income.
5429840	5434160	I mean, at Yale, there are more students from the top 1% of the income scale than from the
5434160	5440480	entire bottom 60%. Like, almost everybody is either I mean, and like, yeah, this is an interesting
5440480	5446000	point, the narcissism of small differences where a lot of the anger I felt was it was like between
5446000	5451840	like someone at the 90th percentile income, who they were angry at that 99th percentile, right?
5451840	5456640	Like, you know, whatever, like someone from a family of whatever doctors and lawyers who are
5456640	5460880	sort of upper middle class who are angry that the children of billionaires get to do something a
5460880	5464800	little more expensive or a little bit more, you know, they get to go on a more expensive vacation,
5464800	5470160	or, you know, like all of that was was very much confined with people who are extremely
5470160	5474000	affluent and well to do. And then there were, you know, a handful of people like me. I mean,
5474000	5477840	I, I'm the only one who had like the kind of life that I had, but I knew some people from more
5477840	5481680	kind of blue collar background. The underclass bona fides. Yeah, exactly. Who are really just
5481680	5486880	kind of like lower middle class blue collar, but not not like, I mean, it's the thing is like the
5486880	5491120	way that the system works is, I think we might have talked about this last time about just how
5491120	5497600	few people like only less than 3% of foster kids graduate from university, less than 3%.
5499120	5504400	And, you know, people who are from the bottom income quintile, it's 11%. And so, you know,
5504400	5507600	really, there are more, you know, you're four times more likely to graduate from college if
5507600	5510320	you're poor than if you live through the foster system. I mean, that's just how
5510800	5515360	the odds are so stacked against you. And so, yeah, I mean, even the people I knew who,
5516240	5520080	so I think I was one of like eight veterans on campus, you know, people think of the military
5520080	5524000	as like, oh, kind of like people who maybe didn't go to college or people who had maybe sort of a
5524000	5530000	more hard scrabble life, which is maybe to some extent true compared to people who go to expensive
5530000	5534960	colleges. But I was, so I was one of eight military vets on campus. But even when I would interact
5534960	5542720	with the other vets and listed vets in my cohort, so there were eight in my cohort, and I would speak
5542720	5545920	with them, I was like, oh, like, basically all of them were raised by two parents and like, you
5545920	5550640	know, had a mom and a dad who did prioritize education and who, you know, kind of said good
5550640	5556800	examples and, you know, all of those things. And I think, yeah, we focus a lot on, I think the
5556800	5561600	left focuses a lot on economics. I think certain strands of the right will focus on behavioral
5561600	5567120	genetics. But there is this sort of cultural component here, too, that people don't really
5567120	5574240	seem to want to touch. At some point, I will write this post up about sort of the limitations of
5574240	5578400	sort of overextending the findings of behavioral genetics. I think like, it's an important thing
5578400	5584240	to know and to understand and to sort of be fluent in, but also to not discount the role of
5584240	5590400	good habits, customs, sort of good behaviors. I wrote this post, nobody's a prisoner of their IQ.
5591200	5596800	And I think that's an important piece, too, that it's true that the guys I grew up with,
5596800	5604560	regardless of their parenting or whatever their economic conditions were, they probably weren't
5604560	5611760	going to be in a position to go to a very expensive, you know, selective university.
5611760	5618880	But I think if they had been maybe taught different values and inculcated different habits,
5619760	5623920	that, you know, two of them wouldn't have gone to prison. One of them was shot to death.
5624720	5629280	Friends working sort of menial, low income jobs. I mean, that's the sort of typical outcome of
5629280	5633440	people in that community. And I don't think like maybe we can't necessarily raise the ceiling for
5633440	5635440	some people. We can definitely raise the floor, I think.
5635440	5640960	Yeah. And so one of the last episodes I did in this room was with destiny. And he prompted this
5640960	5646240	idea that I named two step potential theory, which is a blending of individual agency with
5646240	5651360	real world limitations. Your efforts have tons of control over your outcome within the range that
5651360	5656000	your world's limitations will allow. Behavioral genetics teaches us that on average, around 50%
5656000	5660080	of everything that we are psychologically is inherited from our parents, boo, 50% of our
5660080	5665120	outcomes are limited by our genetics. Yes, but that also means that 50% of them are up to you,
5665120	5669280	which is great. This is another reason to not only compare yourself to who you were yesterday,
5669280	5673440	not to who someone else is today, but it's also a reason to try lots of things
5673520	5676240	until you find the intersection of something that you love and something that you're good at.
5678080	5683840	Yeah, it's like, you can imagine that you have a bracket within which your potential sits.
5684880	5690800	And that bracket is determined very heavily by outside forces. It's genetic predisposition,
5690800	5696240	it's life circumstances, it's nutrition, it's upbringing, it's the fucking unconscious trauma,
5696240	5701280	it's all the epigenetics, it's all of that stuff. But your position within that window
5701280	5706160	is almost exclusively on you. Now, that window also determines your ability to deploy your
5706160	5709440	efforts. But that just moves the window, that doesn't move you within the window.
5711120	5713600	James Clear has this nice line in Atomic Habits about how
5714240	5718000	certain people become so preoccupied with their genetic limitations that they never
5718000	5722960	try to actually reach them. I love that quote. Yeah, it's incredible. And I think people understand
5722960	5726960	this at least in the context of physical fitness. It's like, well, I'm never going to look like
5726960	5730160	Arnold Schwarzenegger, so I'm just not going to go to the gym, which is like a completely
5730880	5736960	misguided way to think about things. But yeah, I like this line about sort of behavioral genetics,
5736960	5742720	but then also there is individual agency involved. And you do have some control over this. I mean,
5742720	5750080	I just wrote this post about Machiavelli and how in the Discourses on Livy, he writes about how
5751440	5754720	he basically says, God doesn't want to do everything. He's like, some of it is up to you.
5754720	5759920	So he was in a much more religious time than we are living in Italy in Catholic Florence.
5760240	5766320	And God doesn't want to do everything. But then he says, you know, basically, 50% of your outcomes
5766320	5771280	are due to fortune, 50% of your outcomes are due to your own individual efforts, and fortune will
5771280	5776160	favor you if you take action, these kinds of things. There's a political philosopher, Harvey
5776160	5780960	Mansfield, who actually suggested that this transition indicates that Machiavelli may have
5780960	5784800	been an atheist, because at first he starts out saying, God doesn't want to do everything. And
5784800	5789520	then he starts saying, 50% is fortune and 50% is you. Well, where does that leave room for God?
5789520	5793840	And Machiavelli may have been sort of subtly indicating to the reader that, you know, you
5793840	5797120	can talk about God, you can think about God, but ultimately it's going to be luck and it's going
5797120	5803120	to be you and that's all you have. Or God has got his percentages wrong. Yeah, exactly. So one of
5803120	5808240	the things, I looked at your end of your review that you did, and that actually reminded me that
5808240	5813200	I hadn't done mine, is in the breakdown of what were the 10, I think you did the 10 most
5813200	5816240	read free articles and paid articles, which you'll still be up on your website and people
5816240	5820560	can go and check that out. And that prompted me while I was back home in the UK that,
5820560	5824960	fuck, I haven't done mine for modern wisdom. So thank you for that. But the best read article
5824960	5830080	that you had last year was one called How I Read. And there's this great screenshot from
5830080	5836320	Taleb in there. Taleb says, the opposite of reading is not not reading, but reading something
5836320	5840080	like the New Yorker. I love that line so much. What do you think he means by that?
5840800	5845360	You know, Taleb is so that you know, there's a screenshot from Twitter, I think there's,
5845360	5850240	you know, there is the sort of Twitter Taleb and then there's the the author. There's different,
5850240	5854400	you know, there's different versions of him. But I the way that I interpreted that, you know,
5854400	5862560	the contankerous tweet from Taleb was that, you know, if reading is defined as, you know, consuming
5862640	5869600	useful, important, timeless information, then, you know, reading, you know, the sort of hot takes in,
5870720	5877360	you know, legacy media institutions, you know, often, you know, colored by bias, colored by the
5877360	5881920	ideologies of our time that, you know, that's actually the opposite of getting useful, you
5881920	5887120	know, important, timeless information, you're getting sort of unuseful, unimportant, timely,
5887120	5891280	you know, relevant, maybe in the moment, and then tomorrow people will forget all about it.
5891360	5896640	And so I think that's kind of what he meant here. And you know, to be fair, like I wrote in there
5896640	5900720	that I do enjoy reading The New Yorker sometimes, but but not as much as I enjoy that tweet.
5900720	5904000	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. What's your advice for people who want to become better readers?
5904960	5908400	I mean, it's, it's a habit, you know, I've been sort of sort of, you know, touching on this,
5908400	5915120	on this idea of discipline of habit of agency. And I think it's, it's similar to a gym routine,
5915120	5921040	right, where when you're starting out, it's, it's difficult, it's, you know, sort of building it
5921040	5926960	into your schedule. But then once you get going, it becomes much easier to just sort of set it
5926960	5930880	and forget it that, you know, from these hours, from this time of day, I'm, you know, I'm going
5930880	5934080	to the gym and here's the workout and here's the routine. And now you don't have to think about
5934080	5940000	it anymore, that sort of discipline equals freedom idea. And so I did that with reading.
5940000	5947200	I've really been kind of on and off reader since I was a kid. I taught myself how to read in the
5947200	5953360	foster homes. And then reading became this kind of, like the suiting experience for me that I could
5953360	5958960	sort of, you know, disconnect from the world and learn about information and, yeah, exactly.
5958960	5965920	And so I would do that. And so it's always been a sort of a companion for me. But, you know,
5967280	5970240	with, with, you know, everyone gets busy, everyone has a million things that they have to do,
5970240	5974080	they have work, they have obligations. But for reading, yeah, it really does, you really have
5974080	5977680	to treat it like a gym routine or like a job or something like an important habit, set time
5977680	5982000	aside every day. And so this is what I was doing in, in grad school was, you know, first thing in
5982000	5985600	the morning, I'd have my cup of coffee and I try to read whatever, you know, five pages,
5985600	5990880	10 pages, 15 pages, whatever it is. If people don't really have the reading habit at all,
5990880	5995120	I do like James Clear's idea of like, start from like the lowest unit of effort possible,
5995120	5999040	like sentence. Yeah, sentence. Yeah, I mean, it'd be really weird if you started from the word
5999040	6003200	level, but yeah, sentence level or a paragraph level, you know, ideally you could get a page in,
6003920	6008640	you know, something substantive, and then build your way from there, whether it's a chapter,
6008640	6011680	whether it's a book, and so on. And I think, yeah, breaking it down in that way is helpful,
6011680	6014400	because, you know, I speak to some people who want to read and they're like, okay,
6014400	6017280	I'm going to try to finish this book this week, or I'm going to try to finish this
6017280	6021040	book this month. And I think like, thinking in those terms isn't really helpful, I think you
6021040	6025920	have to break it down further of, instead of a book a month, I'm going to read three pages a day
6025920	6032160	or 10 pages a day. And then you'll finish the book when it gets finished. The other thing is,
6032160	6036080	if a book is uninteresting to you, or it's not holding your attention to just let it go,
6036080	6040400	you know, it's fine, you don't have to read it just because you bought it, or because you
6040400	6043600	rented it from the library or what have you. Because everybody else says that it's good,
6043600	6047760	or because you read on Twitter that it's really informative. You want to tell the people that
6047760	6051760	you've read it, that they've read it as well. Right. And yeah, you don't, I mean, that's one of the,
6051760	6055520	I was one of the things that I learned too, was, you know, a lot of people, a lot of the sort of
6055520	6059280	chattering class people, they will not read the books that they claim to have read, but they'll
6059280	6064160	read reviews. And so if you want to just like know about a book, to participate in a conversation,
6064160	6069600	just go read three or four reviews online. And that'll sort of give you the highlights of what
6069600	6073840	people are talking about, or what the takeaways are that people care about from the book. But if
6073840	6077120	you really want to do a deep dive, if you really want to understand a book, then yeah, you have to
6077120	6081040	read the whole thing cover to cover, but you know, take it slow, do what you're comfortable with.
6081040	6085360	If you want to skip around, that's fine too, that if a particular chapter title sticks out,
6085360	6089440	it seems to be especially provocative or interesting, start with that chapter first,
6089440	6094080	and then you can go back. I would recommend for most books, especially most older books,
6094800	6103200	to actually read the preface, the, you know, author's note, the foreword, because for a lot of
6103200	6108160	sort of older texts, you know, I mentioned Machiavelli earlier, it does help that those,
6109280	6113360	you know, the prologues and all those kinds of things, they will sort of contextualize the book
6113360	6117280	and sort of explain to some degree, why is this book important? Why do people care about it?
6117280	6122800	What's been the sort of commentary summary of this author's influence throughout the centuries?
6122800	6125520	And so I do recommend reading that and not just skipping to chapter one.
6127680	6132320	And yeah, I mean, there are other things too that you can read multiple books simultaneously,
6132320	6137040	there's no rule in place. I think we learned from school that one book at a time, you know,
6137040	6142880	read this and hear the formula for how you read. But actually, you can do whatever you want, skip
6142880	6147760	around, read two pages of this book, put it down, you know, take a week off, read this other book
6147760	6151440	for a while, I'll do that when I'm on vacation, I'll just start a new book. Even if I'm working on
6151440	6155600	three other books back home, I'll just pick up a new book off the shelf and go on vacation. And
6155600	6161680	that'll be my vacation book. I do weird things like that. And for me, it's helpful. And, and the
6161680	6167120	other thing is it's helpful to take notes to whether it's in the book itself, people get mad
6167120	6170720	at me sometimes on Twitter, they're like, Oh, you're defacing that book, like, Oh,
6170800	6175200	fucking bought it. Yeah, my book. Exactly. Yeah, it's not like I'm vandalized. You know,
6175200	6181440	there's a there's a really good book called how to read a book called Mortimer Adler by Mortimer
6181440	6188160	Adler. And he's, he was a professor at the University of Chicago in the mid mid late 20th
6188160	6193120	century. But he wrote this book basically, like, explaining the different forms of reading,
6193120	6195760	the different types of reading. And this is where I picked up a lot of this information
6195760	6201360	about it's okay to skip around what are your goals for reading, break down the habit. But
6201360	6207600	one of the points he's made is that no one missed, he makes this analogy says no one mistakes the
6208560	6213520	what are they called in in the composers of music, like the sheet, the sheet music or something,
6213520	6219760	no one confuses that for the melody itself, right? It's like no one's, you know, it's not the paper
6219760	6225680	is not sacred, the ideas on them are sacred. And most authors would be flattered if someone was
6225760	6230480	so invested in the book and the topic that added their own fucking, yeah, and the marginalia.
6230480	6236000	And like, yeah, I mean, it's you see this with like, if you visit museums, you know, Cambridge,
6236000	6240480	they have like Darwin's notes or his scribblings of other people's texts. And you can see like he
6240480	6245520	was reading and he was making notes. And, and he was doing this in a time where it was actually
6245520	6253440	harder to get books than it is now. And so engage with the book. Try to understand what the points
6253520	6256800	are in the book. Don't just I mean, this is something that I used to do, even though I was a
6256800	6264160	reader, I didn't really, I didn't really try to understand what the book was about before I started
6264160	6268080	it. It was like, Oh, here's an interesting title. And I'd read the back of it. And it would be,
6268080	6272880	Oh, it's about x, y, z. And I'll, okay, I'll just start reading it and sort of fumble my way through.
6273840	6278240	Rather than think about, okay, where's this author coming from? What point is he trying to make?
6279280	6283040	Why is this book important? Try to take that sort of metal level perspective as well,
6283040	6286880	so that you can really understand where he's coming from and break down the points.
6286880	6293440	If you really want to, especially for more modern social science books, one thing you can do is
6293440	6298160	essentially just read the first and last chapter or the preface in the last chapter. Because,
6298160	6302000	you know, that's just the way that's just a style of reading or style of writing now where,
6302000	6306080	you know, publishers want you to just basically summarize the idea at the beginning and the
6306080	6310640	end for busy people for tired people. What's this book about, you know, like, what are you going
6310640	6314560	to talk about? And then at the end say, here's what I talked about. And that'll sort of give you,
6314560	6319360	you know, maybe 50%. What a funny hack. That's so funny. What about revisiting
6319360	6324800	things? Because your recall seems to be quite impressive, which is something that people want.
6325360	6330160	They want to, reading something and then not being able to recall what you read is kind of,
6330160	6337200	in some ways, like not having read it at all. Yeah, well, I think taking notes, highlighting,
6337200	6341440	and then what I'll do is like, you know, I'll have like a Google doc or some kind of
6341440	6345680	note-taking app where I'll like cut and paste if it's like Kindle version or if it's the paper
6345680	6350000	version. I'll sometimes I'll just post it on Twitter. And then that'll be like the search
6350000	6355840	function where I can find it later. Or I can, yeah, I'll just let it get deleted from Twitter.
6355840	6359600	I know that would be not the access to the audience. It's my own archive of my notes.
6359600	6365360	Exactly. That would be that would be rough. Yeah. Yeah. And so yeah, so I think sharing it in that
6365360	6368880	way. And that's actually how my Twitter started was me just sharing notes and things I was reading.
6368880	6373200	That's like how the initial sort of growth occurred was, you know, I was in, I think it was an
6373200	6380800	undergrad when I started it in 2017, posting my notes online and my highlights and underlines and
6382560	6388160	and so yeah, I think like pinpointing the interesting points, doing like a very brief
6388160	6392800	summary, even it's literally one sentence, preferably a paragraph. If you finish a book,
6392800	6397360	like what did you get from this book? What are two or three things that you remember right now
6397360	6401040	having just finished read it? Because if you if you have just finished reading a book,
6401040	6405600	the most important or interesting or provocative points will be at the top of your mind.
6405600	6408480	Just try to paraphrase it. Don't even go back to the book and say, well, what did he actually say?
6408480	6414480	Try to say, what did I remember? Type it out, try to use that, that forced recall. And that'll help to
6415600	6421920	to to sort of get it into long term memory. And then every once in a while, like if I'm flying
6421920	6426480	on a plane, or if I'm, you know, in waiting in line or something, usually I'll read a book,
6426480	6429760	but sometimes I'll actually just revisit my notes and say, you know, what did that book say? Or what
6429760	6434720	was that point? And do like a control f if I just want to read about whatever mating psychology
6434720	6438160	or what have you, I'll just do the control f and okay, here are my notes on mating psychology
6438160	6442880	from David Buss or this book or that book. And that'll help me to just sort of connect the dots
6442880	6449440	and and and also help to provide material for my sub stack, which is most important, obviously.
6449440	6452560	Rob, I appreciate the hell out of you. It's very good to speak to you again. I'm so happy that
6452560	6457840	this book's finally out. It's taken forever. Yeah, it's been five years plus. Yeah, in the making.
6457840	6461520	Yeah, that this has been going and then it's been ready to be published for a good while as well.
6461520	6466160	And you've been sort of held at the starting line. So where should people go? They want to check out
6466160	6470080	the book that substack the everything else? Yeah, they can get my book troubled, a memoir,
6470080	6473600	foster care, family and social class, that's, you know, wherever, wherever books are sold.
6474160	6478720	And yeah, follow me on Twitter at Rob Gahenderson, substackrobgahenderson.com.
