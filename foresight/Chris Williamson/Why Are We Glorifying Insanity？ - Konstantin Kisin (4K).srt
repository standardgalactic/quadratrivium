1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
One of the things that we've spoken about privately that we haven't yet spoken about publicly is

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,360
victimhood. And James Cantor came on the show. He's a sex researcher. He gave me this really

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,240
interesting quote I wanted you to react to. Shifting from aiding victims to aiding everyone who

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,440
claims victimhood has led to an awful lot of charlatanism. Shifting from doing good to looking

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:25,120
good has led to an awful lot of virtue signaling. Their interaction is now western culture at

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:30,080
least online. What do you think about that? I think it's true. And if you think about,

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,880
you know, I believe people respond to incentives. That's fundamentally the driving force of all

8
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,240
human behavior. We respond to incentives. If you incentivize victimhood, you're going to get victims.

9
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:51,840
And I think online is really the shift that happens because the online world rewards it and

10
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,160
it also allows people to fake victimhood in a way that in person you can't really. Like if you see

11
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,040
someone living in a massive house, you go, well, you may be in victim in some ways, but you are

12
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,800
actually well taken care of here. But online, you can create any avatar you want. And that avatar

13
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,120
can be projected onto the online space from a mansion. And that's kind of where we are.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yeah, the fact that our opinions are more important than our deeds and our words are scrutinized while

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,720
our actions are done in private. You know, how many people have we seen over the last few years?

16
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,240
Ellen DeGeneres, Lizzo, who's that late night host that just got popped for apparently being a

17
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:35,120
Jimmy Fallon, I think, allegedly has these people that outwardly are supposed to be

18
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:41,440
champion for the underclass, like I'm supporting women of all sizes or I'm supporting people that

19
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:46,160
have different sexual orientations or I do the whatever. And then you find out behind the scenes

20
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:51,520
that they can't even treat a PA with dignity. I don't know, it seems to me like

21
00:01:53,040 --> 00:02:00,320
being someone who out front proselytizes about standing up for the underclass

22
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,200
is almost becoming a red flag to go. I probably should scrutinize what's actually going on behind

23
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,240
the scenes here. When I was a stand-up comedian in the comedy world, there's a golden rule of this.

24
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:15,680
The more a comedian talks about how he's a male feminist on stage, the sleazier he is backstage.

25
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,920
It's like a golden rule never fails, always the same. So anyone who goes on stage and talks

26
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,640
about how brilliant they are, they're always, always, always sleazy and evil behind the scenes.

27
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,440
It's just how it works. And I think it's actually, it's a kind of compensatory mechanism.

28
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,920
People who are hiding a bunch of shit have to go out and then pretend to be something they're not.

29
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:43,680
The morality sort of stands on the shoulders of this performative bullshit. Is there a solution

30
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,160
to this? Is there a way that we can scrutinize, given that people's deeds and their actions and

31
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:55,120
their words and their opinions are always going to be far apart? I think that we are living through

32
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,760
a digital revolution for which we're not prepared. Naturally, that's what revolution is, right? It's

33
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:08,080
a change in the paradigm of how we exist. So I think that 10, 15, 20 years from now, we will

34
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,160
look back at the way we use social media now and be horrified by it. It'll be a little bit like

35
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,640
tobacco companies promoting cigarettes as a healthy thing to do. And then we'll be like, whoa,

36
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,720
this was actually causing a lot of damage. So I think the answer to this is a healthier

37
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,480
relationship with the online world in particular. My hope is that we get past this stage and work

38
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,920
out how to use all of that stuff better. I see it in myself, the way I use social media now is

39
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:42,000
very different to the way I would have used it even two years ago. I'm much more responsible with

40
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,720
the way I use it. And I mean in terms of my own life, in terms of how much time I spend on them,

41
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:53,040
what I do, but also in terms of the way I act on social media, because I am trying to be more

42
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:59,440
responsible in what I say is very easy. And I think especially on X or Twitter, whatever you want to

43
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:05,920
call it, to get clicks. And I know exactly how to do that, which is dunk on somebody.

44
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,560
And I spend less and less of my time doing that now, because I don't think that makes the world

45
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,200
better. I don't think it makes me better. It's very rare on Twitter to have someone

46
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,440
break the fourth wall and say, that was out of order. You're not allowed to say that. Everybody

47
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:29,120
plays this sort of permanent game of sardonic tennis. Here's some blasÃ© comment about how you

48
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,840
suck at some smart snipe back at what you said. And oh, I hit it back across the net with something

49
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,480
else. No one actually says what they should say, which is that's fucking out of order.

50
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:44,240
And then you're approved if you do. This is why it's disincentivized. This is coming back to the

51
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,200
point about incentives. Social media rewards certain types of behavior and punishes others. So

52
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:55,520
if you're the guy that says, maybe we shouldn't pile on this person. If your team is doing the

53
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,240
piling on, you're like the one who's not willing. Do you know what I mean? You're not willing to

54
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,800
join in with stoning somebody. And that's why you're a loser. That's the model that we operate in.

55
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:13,840
So being responsible is disincentivized. I love this idea that an absurd ideological belief or

56
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,040
an extreme ideological belief is a show of fealty to your own side and a threat display to the other.

57
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:27,680
And the more absurd or extreme the belief, the more likely it is that your own side can trust

58
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,920
you and that the other side should fear you. Do you know what I mean? That if you have to put

59
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:41,360
reason and sensibility and common decency to one side in order to like, here I am holding my hand

60
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,120
in the air for whatever the current thing is, your own side sees you as a reliable ally.

61
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:53,200
And the other side sees you as a formidable foe. It's tribal mechanics, but multiplied by a thousand

62
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:58,000
because it's online. With everyone scrutinizing you. Yeah. And so you have these weird pathologies

63
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,920
like you've got, and it's not a comment on him personally, but you've got like a guy who lives

64
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:07,440
in Malaysia commenting on American cultural issues and getting like millions and millions of views

65
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,000
for his commentary and whatever. And he's going, I see what you're doing there, but are you actually

66
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,360
contributing to anything? Do you know what I mean? Because it's just flaming, fanning the flames of

67
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,960
whatever is going on. And I see that as a, you know, like I say, it's a period, it's a transitionary

68
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,760
period. I hope that we get to a point where we start to use social media in a different way.

69
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:33,200
And actually, you know, this is an unpopular thing to say, but I don't envy the big tech executives

70
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,120
because it's a really hard job. Because on the one hand, you incentivize to encourage engagement.

71
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:46,880
And on the other hand, the engagement is achieved by amplifying anger and division and all of these

72
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,320
things. So I hope we can work that out as a society. How do we move forward with social media?

73
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,840
What about the victimhood side of things then? You know, like it's kind of,

74
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,680
it's almost like old trope to talk about snowflakes and all this sort of bullshit. It feels like,

75
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,720
you know, five year ago, culture warrior, horse shit. But the underlying dynamic is still

76
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:14,720
there, that we've got this sort of tyranny of the minority in some regards, that fragility is

77
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,280
something to aspire toward, or at least it's something which is rewarded in a variety of

78
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,760
different ways. What's your sort of conception and framework of this with a little bit more

79
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:28,560
perspective that we've got now? Well, I'm going to be speaking at ARC Jordan's

80
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,320
thing later this year. And one of the things I want to talk about is that I think

81
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,800
everyone's embraced us now. We all now do it. I feel like those of us who have been concerned

82
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,560
about wokeness have sort of got into that place where we are like, I'm a victim, I've been cancelled,

83
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:50,240
I've been this and I've been that. And I think it's time actually for us to step into our power now

84
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,360
and go, okay, well, we've created these new media organizations, we've created alliances,

85
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,760
we've created community, we've created things. And the question really for us is now,

86
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,600
we know what we're against, but not enough people are willing to say, what are we for exactly?

87
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,800
And that's because it's much harder to do. But that is the mission now. It's how do you get past

88
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,320
woke, anti-woke into the future? And the future has to be about offering people a better alternative

89
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:22,960
to that victimhood, because it's more rewarding for the individual to see themselves in that way,

90
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,320
I think. And this is why Jordan Peterson was so successful when he broke through,

91
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:34,560
because he was saying to people, take responsibility. And I think we all actually now

92
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:42,560
are in a position where we have to say it to ourselves. Yes, the right wing snowflake sphere

93
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,760
that nobody really ever talks about. I'm pretty sure that you hate that even more than you hate

94
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:58,800
left wing snowflake sphere. Using the call out culture to say this is something that

95
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,480
shouldn't be happening, this is pedestalizing victimhood, so on and so forth. While some people

96
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,440
waving that exact same identity flag themselves, it's like, I don't know, man, that doesn't seem

97
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,600
like the way to go. No, it doesn't. I understand it, though. And I think people on the right

98
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:19,920
could quite credibly say that, well, they did this and now we're using the weapons that they

99
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,640
forged against them. It's understandable. But I'm interested in how do we move forward?

100
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,800
How do we move forward? And I think there's a hell of a lot of questions in modern society

101
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:34,480
about that that remain extremely unanswered. Where do you get meaning and purpose in your life?

102
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:41,440
Now, in a society that has fewer and fewer children in which young people are delaying

103
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:48,800
adulthood longer and longer and longer, where do you get meaning and purpose? Exactly.

104
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,520
For some people, that's online activism, but actually how fulfilling that is, I don't know.

105
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:58,560
So the big questions remain unanswered and perhaps increasingly so, actually. I think

106
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,800
there could well be an argument that 80 years ago, people had way more meaning and purpose

107
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,160
readily available to them at just through the course of normal life, get married, have kids,

108
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,600
whatever. Now, obviously, that wasn't universally available to everybody, et cetera. But I think

109
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:22,640
in the modern world, actually, way more people are lost. They don't know what they're supposed to do

110
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:29,120
exactly. So in the past, we had a set trajectory you're supposed to follow, which hurt some people

111
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,200
because it wasn't the trajectory for them. But when you take away all trajectory, then

112
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:39,600
everybody is lost. And I think a lot of people are in that position now. And as I said, I think

113
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,040
it's way harder to think about what the positive vision of the future is. But that, I think, is

114
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:52,960
the task now. That's the mission. If you think wokeness is stupid and dangerous and harmful,

115
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:58,720
which I do, well, what do you think in addition to that? What do you think beyond that? What is it

116
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,400
that you think people ought to do? If they ought not to be victims, what ought they to think about

117
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:10,480
with their lives? And that's a very difficult question that I have more questions than answers

118
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:17,920
about. It's way easier to identify problems than proposed solutions. And you almost see this on

119
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:25,200
the internet that if somebody identifies a problem, it's kind of hard to criticize a criticism. It's

120
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:33,520
possible, but it's way easier to criticize a proposal. And it's almost like a defense mechanism

121
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:40,480
that people have to front load or front run, avoiding the criticism that they know will become

122
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,480
will be incoming. It's the caveat. It's like, I'm not saying that we don't need to care about

123
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,520
such and such. And I'm not saying that this isn't a big deal, but maybe we need to think

124
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,760
about this thing. It's almost like a conceptual equivalent of that.

125
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,840
Yes. And I find myself doing that all the time. Fortifying with caveats.

126
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:01,520
All the time, man. Because I think the other aspect of the online, the way the communication

127
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:07,360
happens online is like, if you make a statement, a generalized statement, you might say exercise

128
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,440
is good for you. And somebody will be like, yeah, well, what if you've got an ear injury?

129
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:17,600
And before you know it, like you hate disabled people. That's kind of how the conversation

130
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:23,520
happens. But I think when we stop being able to make normative statements, everything else

131
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:28,960
breaks down. We have to be able to say, for most people, most of the time, pairing up with

132
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:33,760
someone of the sex that they are attracted to and building a life together is better than not

133
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,560
doing that. We have to be able to say that without the one person who was in an abusive

134
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,760
relationship. Well, what about me? Yes, we understand you, but we're talking about the 95%

135
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,640
of people, right? And you feel free not to go along with whatever we're putting on the table.

136
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,760
It's like, if we put a menu of things on the table, you don't have to eat everything.

137
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,160
No one is making you eat the gluten. It's the Ricky Gervais guitar lessons thing, right?

138
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,480
Exactly. So I think we have to be able to say

139
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,800
all other things being equal, family is good. This is the tyranny of the minority. I

140
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:12,880
fucking love that phrase. I think it's so smart to optimize for the edges of the bell curve rather

141
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:18,880
than the middle. And as you said before, it is important to recognize that there are people

142
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:24,640
who fall outside of the norms of normality and that they need some care as well. And if you

143
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,720
didn't have that sufficiently broad perspective view, these people would just fall through the

144
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,360
cracks and that's fucking shit. And nobody wants that to happen. But when you optimize for that,

145
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,960
you actually end up, if you were to net out what happens, you end up with more suffering because

146
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:41,120
you neglect all of the fucking fat bit of the middle of the distribution.

147
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,160
That's right. And we've stopped being able to make that point because we... And also,

148
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,240
I think the phrase that I came across and I didn't come up with this, but somebody was saying to me

149
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,840
the other day that we live in a world of trade-off denialism.

150
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,360
What does that mean?

151
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:02,960
Every decision has trade-offs. It has positives and negatives. And if you go, well, we should do

152
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:07,120
this and someone goes, yeah, but what about the thing that... And then you can never really

153
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,880
acknowledge. It's like the climate catastrophe. No one wants to talk about the fact that many

154
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:19,040
of the solutions that are being proposed would be worse than the problem. So it's like, if you say

155
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,560
anything about how we're approaching that issue, you are denying that climate change is real or

156
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,240
you are denying that it's a problem or you're denying that we should address it. No, I just

157
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,680
think your idea of how to fix it is stupid. And we've lost the ability to have that conversation

158
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,280
as well. And I think we'll really need to reintroduce. It's one of the things I talked about

159
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:42,240
in my Oxford speech, which I think is why it did well is because people went, oh, yeah,

160
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,400
all right, because if we just do the stuff that we've been told we need to do, that's actually

161
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:52,880
worse. And that sort of opened it up. I think we've totally forgotten that there are no solutions,

162
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,680
only trade-offs. My favorite quote ever from Thomas Sowell.

163
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,720
Yeah, it's lovely. And the difference between maximizing and

164
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,120
satisfying from behavioral economics is an interesting one. So maximizing is everything

165
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:12,320
must be 100, 100, 100, 100. Satisfying is hitting an acceptable level across everything.

166
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,800
And what the satisfying allows you to do is it allows you to iterate much more quickly.

167
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,280
And as you say, you can do it in your own life. It's like, how many times have you done it?

168
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:27,840
Going to go away on holiday with the misses. And we're going to have a fucking Airbnb or booking.com

169
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:32,960
favorite list with 30 hotels or 30 places in. And by the time that you get down to choosing them,

170
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,080
the choice has been made for you, because all of the nice ones have gone and you're now two days

171
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:40,480
before you leave. Right? That's maximizing. And you're so stressed, you need the holiday just

172
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,280
because it was awful. You didn't even enjoy the experience of it as well.

173
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,680
Yeah. Yeah. I understand, man, like, you know,

174
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,600
people feel like they're being left behind. They feel like life is happening to them

175
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,000
or happening for other people. And they're not a part of it. And I get that. Like,

176
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:59,520
you know, fucking, it's disquieting. Life is going on. My friends are moving on. The world

177
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:05,120
is changing. And I'm all confused. But I suppose this sort of information ecosystem

178
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:10,960
conversation, which you guys have had a good bit. And I've had twice over the last few weeks,

179
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:17,040
first with Sam Harris, and then with Eric Weinstein. What do you make of this? Like,

180
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:24,560
the heterodoxosphere has its problems. The legacy media sphere has its problems.

181
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,560
Independent creators that just get to shitpost anonymously on Twitter and Reddit. Also,

182
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:35,840
I like very unreliable. Do you think about this? Like, how all of this comes together

183
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,840
and how you move forward through it? I see a lot of problems with new media too.

184
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,200
I mean, and I've said this from day one in terms of what we do at Trigonometry.

185
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:50,560
It's we don't have a budget to employ a bunch of people to do extensive research on things

186
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:56,560
or to do fact checking for us. So we can't do certain things that the mainstream media can do

187
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,760
and should do. The problem is the mainstream media isn't doing it either.

188
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,680
But there's a really important role for the mainstream media. I just wish they'd play that

189
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:14,400
role. But I think where I agree with Sam, even though I disagree with him on COVID and

190
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,280
to some extent, well, to a large extent, Trump and all those things, is not everything can be

191
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,920
fixed on a podcast. That is absolutely true. There are certain things that are a matter of

192
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:29,920
research and deeper study. And it's not everything can be sorted out in three

193
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,800
hour conversation between two podcasters. There's not how that works. And I think

194
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:44,880
new media has its own problems. It over rewards charisma. It over rewards passion.

195
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:55,520
It massively under rewards any attempts to cling to truth. It encourages people to go off

196
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,800
in the pursuit of the most exciting take. And truth isn't always exciting.

197
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,560
So I think the truth is we need a vibrant ecosystem in which all of these different

198
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:11,760
pieces play their own different roles, which is why I'm in favor of maximum freedom because

199
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:17,760
that's where you get everybody doing their thing. And then over time, people who want

200
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:22,480
wholesome content, if you like, when it comes to facts or information or whatever,

201
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:29,600
can seek it out because people aren't stupid. They will eventually see through someone being

202
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,160
super charismatic or whatever. They'll get to a point where they go, actually, what I'd like to

203
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,160
do is have a look at what different sources are saying about this and make up my own mind.

204
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,320
You saw with COVID, the mainstream media really suppressed a lot of very legitimate points of

205
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:48,160
view, a lot of important information. But then you get the response to that, which is to go

206
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:54,320
quite far off the other end. And I've ended up somewhere, what I hope is a kind of reasonable

207
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,360
middle ground between those two positions. There's a really great blog post by Gwinda Bogle,

208
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:05,280
gowinda.substack.com, one of my favorite writers, why you are probably an NPC. And he frames out

209
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:11,520
five different types of NPC. And the most obvious two, like sort of the mainstream NPC and the

210
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:17,040
contrarian NPC, he makes this really great point, which is that the contrarian NPC is no deeper

211
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:22,800
thinking than the mainstream NPC, they're just the inversion of it. And he uses the line of

212
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:32,080
being a black sheep might make you different, but you're still a sheep. And that allure, this sort

213
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:39,840
of romance of being the independent thought leader, maker, sense maker, person. I understand

214
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:45,600
why it happens. But yeah, reflexive contrarianism is no more nuanced than reflexive belief of the

215
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:54,240
hegemony. Yes. And I don't judge people for that because I think that's an element of my thinking.

216
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:01,920
I think it's very understandable, disillusionment with the way the institutions have been captured

217
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:06,240
or have been corrupted or perverted or whatever it is that's happened to them.

218
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:14,320
It is natural that that would produce an equal and opposite reaction. I encourage myself and other

219
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:21,760
people to go beyond that. I try as best I can. And to go, okay, well, we're reacting to this. This

220
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,840
is how we're behaving. What's the actual truth? Because that's where we started. We started from

221
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,360
the position that we cared about the truth. That's why we're so annoyed with the mainstream.

222
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:35,440
Can we find somewhere in between those two positions that actually is an attempt to find

223
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:42,400
that truth? And it's the case with everything. We've had a bunch of, we just had the co-founder

224
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:48,960
of Navara Media on Trigonometry, the far left YouTube, or maybe not far left, is a kind of

225
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,920
Corbinista supporting kind of people and others because we're trying to speak to different people

226
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:59,200
from different places and really get to what the bottom of is of different issues because

227
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,360
those perspectives are valuable too. One of the things that Sam brought up on the episode with

228
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:12,000
me was his infamous Twitter clip with you. What was the experience of that particular 180 seconds

229
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:19,840
catching fire like? You know, I felt terrible when that happened. Really, really terrible.

230
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:26,640
Because I've never been on the end of a Twitter shitstorm to that extent,

231
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:34,080
but it's not pleasant. No matter how strong-minded you are, whatever, there's a reason that

232
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,800
Rogan always says, don't read the comments, right? Like the great man Joseph Stalin says,

233
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:45,840
quantity has a quality all of its own. So there's only a certain number of negative comments you

234
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:52,560
can ignore until just the volume of shit becomes overwhelming. So my primary concern actually,

235
00:21:52,560 --> 00:22:00,320
I don't know Sam well, but was for his well-being actually. I just worried how he would experience

236
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:06,160
that more than anything. That was my concern because our approach is always about giving a

237
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:11,200
guest an opportunity to reveal themselves in the best light possible. And for some people,

238
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:17,520
that light shines very brightly and can burn. But that's not our intention. We never go into

239
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,320
an interview with a desire to out somebody or expose somebody. It's not a gotcha.

240
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:27,600
It's not a gotcha. So I was worried about him. And I emailed him straight away just to check

241
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:33,040
up on him. And also, we didn't put that clip out. We could have done because we obviously

242
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,880
understood that it was a controversial thing he said. And actually, most people don't know this,

243
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,200
but that was not the most controversial thing he said in that interview, in my opinion.

244
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,080
We talked about COVID on locals, which was the paywall section of the interview,

245
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,040
and what he said there, I found quite... What did he say?

246
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:53,120
I don't remember the wording of people who have to go and watch it, but I came away from that

247
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:58,320
thinking that he's overestimating the threat. And as a result of that, I was prepared to do

248
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:05,600
some pretty drastic things or demand drastic things to be done. So first and foremost,

249
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,880
as somebody who interviews people for a living, I was concerned for him,

250
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:15,920
but I also felt that what he said was wrong. I didn't agree with it.

251
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:26,880
My view on it is that if you overestimate the nature of the threat, all else follows. And I

252
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:33,280
think on Trump and COVID, that is where Sam, in my opinion, is... Well, that's why he's doing what

253
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:40,240
he's doing and saying what he's saying, because if I thought Trump was as bad as Sam thinks,

254
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:45,040
it'd be very tempting to think along the lines that Sam thinks along. And likewise with COVID,

255
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:54,160
if I thought this was like Ebola that spreads, I'd also be... We should also be honest. The

256
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:59,040
conversation, people were like, well, there's never, ever, ever any reason for the government

257
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:05,200
to mandate vaccines. And I broadly agree with that, unless the disease is really dangerous and

258
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:11,680
deadly. I said this at the beginning of COVID. Imagine that the disease had 100% mortality

259
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:16,000
rate for all women, or it was 100% mortality rate for all people under the age of 10.

260
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,160
Maybe some people would support it. Well, yeah, but I think that the... Fundamentally,

261
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:27,440
it came down to a risk and reward equation. And most people considered that the risk of getting

262
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:35,040
COVID was not greater than the risk of either getting the vaccine or of opening up mandated

263
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:39,200
vaccines as a pathway overall, right? And it's just, where do you sit on this equation? There's

264
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,800
lots of other things, but broadly, I think it's where do you sit on this equation. And Sam,

265
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:53,120
I completely agree with him that I think COVID, as an event, was like the worst kind of vaccine that

266
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,320
we could have given our epidemiology, our medical system, the view of vaccines overall.

267
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,880
Vaccine skepticism at large, I bet, has gone through the fucking risk.

268
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,080
It has. It has.

269
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,040
Have you had a look at this?

270
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:10,080
Yeah, of course it has. I know anecdotally, just speaking to people, how much that's the case,

271
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:10,400
yeah.

272
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,640
So if we are to have something that comes around the next time, and it does kill fucking all

273
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,280
children under 10 or all women or whatever the fuck, it's got some incubation period of 28 days

274
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:25,520
and a mortality of 40%, it's just a Psyop. It's another Psyop. This is Klaus Schwab doing it again.

275
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:31,520
This is the WEF. And it's like, oh, God, like that's, that's, it literally would have been

276
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,000
better if COVID hadn't happened, right? Sure enough, we can get masks out of the way more

277
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,240
quickly. And we've got like some, some inefficiencies in the system were opened up.

278
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:47,360
But if you were to look at COVID as a like operational logistical vaccine, our response

279
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:53,680
to it failed us way worse than if we'd never got it at all. And we got a vaccine injury from COVID.

280
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:58,800
Yes. Yes, we did. And, and I also think the one thing that is sort of inexplicably neglected

281
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:05,200
in all of this is I'd really like to know where COVID came from. I'd really like to know, don't

282
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,640
you think that's important? Don't you think we should know where it came from? Because there

283
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:16,720
are some credible assertions about its origins that would suggest that we may have another pandemic

284
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:23,440
soon. Is that right? I haven't seen this. Well, if this came from a lab in Wuhan,

285
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:29,040
because of gain of function research, and we are not willing to be honest about that,

286
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,400
and gain of function research continues, why wouldn't we have another pandemic?

287
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,320
I never looked into this much. I know that Sam had Matt Ridley and somebody else,

288
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,520
somebody else on his show. We've had Matt on to talk about this as well. Okay, cool.

289
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:47,120
And the truth is, we don't know. But I'm using the kind of the smell test here because

290
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:56,720
I grew up in a communist society. And what communist societies do when there is something,

291
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,800
and all societies do this to a large extent, because people don't like to expose their own

292
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,960
flaws. And no one wants to be like, oh, I was responsible for killing millions of people,

293
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:13,520
but they will cover it up in a way that is proper. And Matt actually gave this example of

294
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,720
there was a leak somewhere in the Soviet Union, which was a radioactive leak, I think, or maybe it

295
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:24,240
was a biological, and they covered up for ages. And then when the Soviet Union collapsed, we finally

296
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:30,800
found out, no, no, it was actually a leak. So if this is a product of gain of function research

297
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:35,360
getting out into the real world, which is credible, that there's very credible assertions about that,

298
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:42,960
the world needs to know, and this type of research needs to end. But if we are unwilling to have that

299
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,560
conversation, honestly, and do the proper investigations, which would be difficult because

300
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,880
the CCP wouldn't want that. And on top of that, you've got all this other bullshit about how it's

301
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:57,840
racist and all of that, we've got a problem. So I think my worry with everything that's

302
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:03,840
happened with COVID is not only have we not learned the lessons, I feel like, like you said,

303
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:09,200
we've got a vaccine injury from the experience, and everyone is sort of stuck in their corner.

304
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,560
And like Sam said, to you, everyone's got their own facts about it now.

305
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:16,240
Correct. That's a problem.

306
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:24,960
It's interesting what you said about the felt sense of being in the blast radius of Sam's

307
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:32,240
online experience. I noticed it, is someone called it Sam Harris's World Embarrassment Tour,

308
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,200
because he did my show, he did Steven's show, and he did Tom Billu's show.

309
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:42,640
And I don't know, man, like, there seems to be something, it's almost like there was resentment

310
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:47,200
sat on the internet, latent resentment sat on the internet waiting for Sam to fuck up.

311
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,640
And then he did a thing, or maybe maybe it's right.

312
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,880
I don't think it was personal. That was the reason I paused there. I don't think it was

313
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:00,240
personal to Sam. I think, particularly on his Trump comments, there are a lot of people who were

314
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:07,520
like, this is what we always knew the Trump haters think deep inside. And Sam was willing to vocalize

315
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:14,400
it, which is, I don't care how big the transgressions are on the other side. I don't care what Hunter

316
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:19,600
Biden has done. I don't care what Joe Biden has done. No matter what they do, it can never be as bad

317
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:26,800
as Orange Man bad. And that's sort of how he came across. And so the people who felt gaslit this

318
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:35,600
entire time about, you know, the overestimation of the threat of Trump, they were vindicated in

319
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:40,720
that moment. And I think Sam just was caught in the rage of people feeling like-

320
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,880
They're kind of like the perfect time storm. Yes.

321
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:48,320
With the perfect pebble in the perfect river that directed it. Yeah, it's so interesting,

322
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:54,800
man. I had this conversation with a fitness influencer called Sarah Safari in LA a couple

323
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,720
of weeks ago. I'd be interested to get your thoughts on this. I think it's analogous to this Sam

324
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:06,560
situation. A lot of people, especially right of center, say things like, you can't judge somebody

325
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:15,760
on just one thing that they say. Yet, when it came to a six pack of Bud Light being sent to

326
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:23,280
Dylan Mulvaney by some marketing intern somewhere deep in the annals of the Anheuser-Busch thing,

327
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:28,640
or Miller Light release one video, the Miller Light thing felt a little bit more produced.

328
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,240
It's probably gone through a few more layers. But largely, I just wondered, I thought it was

329
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:39,760
interesting that the charity that a lot of people right of center ask to be given to their

330
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,800
commentators or, you know, their champions that are canceled for taking out of context points.

331
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:49,600
There was that Rosanne Bar bit with Theo Von, where she made a joke about the Jews,

332
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:54,720
which was the most egregious clipping that I've ever seen from anything ever,

333
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:00,320
the end of a three minute long bit. And they took the final 30 seconds and put it up as if it was

334
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:07,360
representative of the whole thing. It was so fucking bad. But I did notice nobody decided to

335
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:13,920
use that same idea about, hang on a second, maybe this is just one small department in one small

336
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:19,920
corner of one small brand's marketing push. And they gave this person who is very unpopular on

337
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:24,880
the internet, a six packet Bud Light. And before you know it, Kid Rock's got an AR15 pointed at

338
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:32,640
a few cases of your drink. What do you think about? So I would separate those two out. So Sam, I think

339
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,680
that point applies very much. And this is the angle I'm coming from. And by the way,

340
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:42,080
we're about to go back to America and we'll interview Sam, the sequel. So we'll see how that

341
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,520
works out. I'm looking forward to it. But with Sam, what I felt was,

342
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:50,880
for me, I don't know if it's true of other people, but for me, Sam has a lot of credit in the bank

343
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:59,200
with me. And so I felt that while I strongly disagree with what he said, and I think that was

344
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:06,560
clear in the interview, he has enough credit in the bank with me that I'm willing to have a lot of

345
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:12,640
understanding and a lot of grace with him. And what I would say as well is,

346
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,360
we were having a lot of tech issues on the day that we interviewed Sam and he sat there for

347
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:22,080
like a good hour while we were trying to scrambling to get the microphones to work. And he was the

348
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:29,200
most decent human being that we've had on the show. You see who someone really is when the cameras

349
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,720
aren't rolling. That seemed to me like a really important thing that other people obviously

350
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:39,600
wouldn't have seen. So I have a lot of time for Sam and respect for him. I don't have the same

351
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:47,040
relationship with Dylan Mulvaney. And I also think- You haven't taken a world of wisdom from

352
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:53,280
Dylan Mulvaney over the last few- You'll be surprised, man. You'll be surprised. And so I think, look,

353
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:59,040
Dylan Mulvaney is a symbol to many people, like Sam is a symbol to many people for different things.

354
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:04,000
But I think it's a slightly different issue because, I don't know if you saw, but immediately

355
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,080
after the Dylan Mulvaney controversy, the marketing executive who was responsible for this,

356
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,680
there was a video of her talking to, I think, a reporter about the thinking behind

357
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,800
what the idea there was. Because it seemed a little bit more thought out.

358
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:27,280
It was thought out and her angle was our customers are shit. That was her angle.

359
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:35,360
Our shit. What's a shit customer? Well, it's just these guys who've got an old-fashioned sense of

360
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:40,480
humor. Do you know what I mean? We're going to educate our customers. And I'm like, you sell

361
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:47,120
beer. That's not your job. Sell them the fucking beer and shut up. And look, the trans issue for

362
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,080
reasons I actually think are quite understandable and obvious is the lightning rod of our time.

363
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:57,360
So, I'm not surprised that that caused the reaction that it did. And I understand it.

364
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:05,760
I do think, and I wrote a substack on this at the time, that perhaps the giving so much attention

365
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,880
to it is what prompts these brands to go down this route. Obviously, with Dylan Mulvaney,

366
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:14,080
it backfired for sure. It's a role of the dice for attention.

367
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:17,280
It's a role of the dice for attention that I don't think they'd consider. And I think that

368
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:22,240
executive ended up being fired. I do understand why people got as fired up about it as they did,

369
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:27,280
because you're rewarding behavior that a lot of people would feel is the wrong behavior to reward

370
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:34,000
in the public eye. Dylan Mulvaney. But that woman is one lady. Maybe in her interview with the

371
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,760
reporter, she said, this went all the way up and the director, CEO, the fucking chief marketing

372
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:44,240
officer or whatever was involved in this. But if it wasn't the case, I don't... If it turned out

373
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:50,000
that it was one small group in the corner, as I guessed or whatever, I don't think that the

374
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,280
internet would have given Bud Light any more leeway. I don't think they would have said,

375
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,840
we need to separate the art and the artist here. They've made beer for three decades,

376
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:05,680
for however fucking long it's been around. And maybe it's right. Maybe it shows their

377
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:12,080
woke bona fides. It shows that they're the man-hating, left-leaning, blue-head cucks that they always

378
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:21,360
were. But I don't know. It seems like a lot of the time people want... It's a smart idea to be able

379
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:27,360
to say, Rogan has been in a few controversies over the last few years. Most people said,

380
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:32,640
I have faith that you're telling me this is the tip of the iceberg. I've seen the whole iceberg.

381
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:38,080
I know that there is nothing lurking deep down in the depths. Massive advantage he has is he's

382
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:44,720
published like 5,000 hours of content over the last decade, which means that you have a pretty

383
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,040
good body of evidence that sits on the other side of the scale. But you don't know much about what's

384
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,080
going on inside of the marketing department. But I just thought it was interesting. I thought that

385
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:59,760
maybe this is a time where it would be illustrative and you should be careful about transgressing

386
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:05,600
rules that you want to be enforced. So if you want the don't judge somebody by one single occurrence

387
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:12,560
rule to be enforced and then you don't enforce it, that, as you said before, that tit for tat game,

388
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,400
it opens up what they did it. So this is playground mentality.

389
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,640
I understand what you mean, but I think I disagree actually. I think the reason that people

390
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:28,560
were as upset about as they are is while these are different companies, the sense is... Imagine

391
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:33,520
it wasn't just Rogan who said something, but it was Chris Williamson and Trigonometry and all the

392
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:39,680
other podcasters who do what we do all at one point said the same thing. And then there was yet

393
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,360
another example of a podcaster saying it. So when you look at the Gillette

394
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:50,880
Mattoxic Masculinity ad, if you look at all the other instances where corporations put pride

395
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,120
flags, they replace their brand with pride. But not in the Middle East. Well, obviously not.

396
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,920
Do they do it in Russia? They can't do it in Russia either. I doubt it. I doubt it. I can't imagine why.

397
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,960
Mother Russia gay has you. Yeah, exactly. So I think what people felt was here again,

398
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:12,480
we've got a corporation just absolutely taking the piss, lecturing the ordinary public,

399
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:19,200
and thrusting these very niche issues onto what is a very, very like normal household

400
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:24,480
beer. And you just can't escape this shit. That's what I think people feel.

401
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,040
So it's kind of a straw that broke the camel's back. I agree.

402
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:31,280
Big corporation overall. That's interesting. Because what I was doing was I was taking

403
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:37,040
Bud Light as a individual instance on its own. What you're saying is this is more endemic

404
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:42,560
of a broader trend among big corporations. Well, broadly speaking, if you think about what the

405
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:47,440
anti-woke narrative is, the anti-woke narrative is, and I agree with very large parts of it,

406
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,640
is that most of the major institutions, whether that be media, whether that be the civil service,

407
00:37:52,640 --> 00:38:00,320
whether that be the political systems, the parties, the corporations, the education system,

408
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:05,760
they've all been captured or corrupted or through some other mechanism become

409
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:11,760
the projectors of a certain worldview onto the public who do not share that worldview.

410
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:19,440
And so when you see the toxic masculinity Gillette ad, which is like, hey, you're a man,

411
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:27,920
you're a piece of shit by a razor. You're a piece of shit by a beer, et cetera.

412
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,760
It sort of builds up to a point like, why is everyone telling me I'm a piece of shit?

413
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:40,720
And it gets old. And particularly this anti-masculinity narrative that you see

414
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:47,760
everywhere in movies, in advertising, in all sorts of different genres,

415
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:53,600
I think it's really, really dangerous because if you think about Gillette ads in the 90s,

416
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,800
you're a bit younger than me. I don't know if you remember them, but they were

417
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:02,080
the best a man can get. And it's like some blonde hot chick in like a whatever. She's like

418
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:08,640
actually that wasn't the 90s Gillette ads. The 90s Gillette ads were a bunch of men

419
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:16,160
being healthy masculinity. It was a man putting his tie on as he holds his baby up before he's

420
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:23,440
going to work. It was a man hugging his son on his way to his wedding. It was a man protecting his

421
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:28,880
wife. It was a healthy view of men and relationships and men and women and so on.

422
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:36,000
And I sort of say healthy masculinity is the 90s Gillette ads. That's what it looks like.

423
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:42,400
Men being responsible, men in relationships with women being respectful, being kind, but also being

424
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:48,320
strong, looking after their children, teaching younger versions of men how to be men, etc.

425
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:55,600
And I understand why people, men and women are fucking tired, really, really tired of this idea

426
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:01,840
that men are bad and evil. I always say my wife is completely apolitical and as a result of that

427
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:09,120
extremely based. She hates this shit and I can't tell you how many women I speak to

428
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:12,640
who are very, very tired of men being demonized in this way and so am I.

429
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,360
Especially given that a lot of those women will have sons.

430
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,400
And they want their partner to be good and healthy. They don't want them to be feeble,

431
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:26,240
you know. So I actually, I understand the pushback against that I really do and I think it's necessary.

432
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:33,920
Yeah, I mean, I've spent a lot of time talking about modern masculinity and the challenges that

433
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:39,920
everybody is facing. What do you think, like looking at it from your perspective, growing up

434
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:45,680
where you did in a communist country, coming here at 13, remember that, coming here at 13,

435
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,040
do you think the conversation around modern masculinity from both sides of the fence is

436
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:57,440
missing? Like what don't they understand about being a man in 2023 and the challenges and the

437
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:02,240
way that the culture sees them? I think we should zoom out more, even more than that and ask the

438
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:12,240
question, what is it that we want as a society? And I pissed both sides of the spectrum off by saying

439
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:19,360
what I'm about to say, which is any ideology, and I mean any ideology, that pits men against women

440
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:25,120
or women against men is toxic and damaging and dangerous and unhealthy. And that includes

441
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:30,000
some forms of feminism and that includes, you know, the incel worldview and all sorts of things.

442
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:36,480
So the thing that we're really missing is a reminder of the fact that I'm going to do the caveat

443
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,640
thing we talked about. Yes, some people are not heterosexual, but for the vast majority of people,

444
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,640
the single most meaningful thing in your life is going to be the relationship you have

445
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:51,040
with your intimate partner, almost always of the opposite sex, right? And we need each other.

446
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:58,240
Men and women need each other. We've been working together for millennia and anyone who tells you

447
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:04,320
that your enemy is the opposite sex, that person is your enemy. That person is your enemy,

448
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:09,040
that person is my enemy, and that person is our society's enemy. They are destroying or

449
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:14,960
attempting to destroy the very building block of our society. That comes from both sides of

450
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:26,080
the advice as well. Yes. The red pillar sphere teaches men that women are adversaries to be

451
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:30,960
avoided or resources to be used and discarded. Those are the only two ways. And, you know,

452
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:36,160
that's black, that's the entire man's sphere, actually. That's black pill, migthau, incels,

453
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:43,840
pick up artistry, red pill, sigma male, all the way, like the full, that's the entire gamut for

454
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:47,760
anyone that doesn't know the memes. That's the entire memeosphere of the fucking man's sphere.

455
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,960
And yeah, there's no one in there, very, very few people in there who say,

456
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:59,520
you're supposed to be a collaborator with the opposite sex. Most of your competition is

457
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:05,360
intracexual, not intersexual. Men and women have worked together for eons. You need each other

458
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:10,880
to survive, just because you've outsourced protecting and provisioning to the police

459
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:17,440
department and the local supermarket. And you women have outsourced the resources

460
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:25,600
and the company to your ability to gain education and employment and Netflix.

461
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:31,280
Still, broadly, we're not going to be able to out-technology ourselves from the last

462
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:37,680
120,000 years of humans being the way that we are. There's more to relationship than dildo,

463
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,200
right? You're not a dildo to your partner. There's more that you bring to the table.

464
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:46,320
Sometimes. Well, I'm speaking for myself, maybe I'm not sufficient in that department. But

465
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:50,080
my point is, let's frame this in a positive way. What is it that we're trying to say?

466
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:54,640
Well, what you're trying to say is men and women need each other. Men and women need to work together.

467
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:02,400
Men and women are not enemies. The most powerful you are ever going to be is with a

468
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,880
good woman by your side. What do you say to the people that go,

469
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:12,080
this is Treadpill nonsense, like Treadcon talking point 101. This is just another NPC

470
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:17,840
meme but coming from someone that's steeped in a type of relationship that men or women

471
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:21,040
don't need anymore. Well, you know how Bitcoin is saying have fun staying poor?

472
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:27,760
Have fun being a loser. You want to spend your life being unhappy with the opposite sex,

473
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:32,240
whether you are a feminist or one of these people, go for it. I'm not going to tell you

474
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,760
how to live your life, but I don't think it's going to lead you to a good place.

475
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:43,600
You know, I have male friends who've recently found their soulmate or their partner and they

476
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:51,440
blossom. They blossom the moment that it happens because we evolved to be together. We evolved

477
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:58,000
to work together. We evolved to drive each other forward in really powerful ways. I wouldn't be

478
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,040
a 10th of the man I am without my wife. Did you read the post I put up a couple of weeks ago

479
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:08,800
about the fuck you family? No, I didn't see that. So fuck you money, right? You're able to become.

480
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,080
Oh, I did see that. Yes.

481
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:13,520
It's sufficiently financially independent that money, you don't need to do things you

482
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,960
don't want to do. Fuck you freedom. You don't need to do things that you don't want to do.

483
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:22,560
But then the final stage I see amongst my male friends who are, you know, 30s and 40s

484
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:29,760
is the fuck you family, which is a all that I fundamentally care about in the end is me

485
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:36,560
and the people that are a part of this nuclear pod and everything else can go to hell.

486
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,600
Everything else can fall apart. Jimmy Carr was just sat in that seat.

487
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:44,720
He's been through his fair share of like roller coasters and he's been with his partner

488
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,400
like a decade and a bit like fucking forever, like maybe even 20, like 20 something years.

489
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:54,800
And now he's got a son and a daughter and yeah, the coming home to know that as long as that's

490
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,880
okay, as long as that's set and presuming that you've stacked the fuck you money with the fuck

491
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:04,080
you freedom and then you add the family on top, it must be kind of similar to being indestructible.

492
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:08,240
I'm still working on the fuck you money. It's still a long way to go on the fuck you money.

493
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,040
The freedom and the family. The freedom and the family, yes.

494
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:19,120
My wife and I, we met by complete accident when we were 18, married by 20 and been together

495
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:25,760
ever since. And just on a very practical, like what did I get out of it level,

496
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:32,560
it's been the single most beneficial source of inspiration, comfort,

497
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:41,440
pick each other up when you're down, all of that. I mean, I admire people who don't have that and

498
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:45,600
still do lots of stuff in the world, but it would be so much harder, so, so much harder.

499
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:50,320
So again, I'm not telling other people how to live their life. I'm just saying

500
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:56,560
this has been one of the most tried and tested solutions to various problems that human beings

501
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:02,480
experience throughout history. We evolved to be together. And if it's a trad talking point,

502
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:07,200
then maybe that's right. Maybe that some trad talking points are correct.

503
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:11,040
Getting back to the masculinity conversation, why do you think it's so difficult for people to

504
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,320
publicly advocate for the problems of men and boys?

505
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,360
Because victimhood doesn't work for men the way it works for women.

506
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:23,200
We don't feel sorry for men. And rightly so, by the way.

507
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:27,600
Rightly so. I mean, biologically, men are disposable in a way that women aren't,

508
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:32,640
for the obvious reasons. If you have a tribe of 10 men, 10 women, you send the women off to war,

509
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:36,240
you're screwed, you send the men off to war, one comes back, you can still replenish

510
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:40,160
the population. So men are disposable, always will be, much more than women.

511
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:46,720
And so we don't feel sorry for men in the same way. And I'm not advocating that we feel sorry

512
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:51,920
for men because I don't believe that's the solution to men's problems. The solution to

513
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,800
men's problems is for men to be better. What does that mean?

514
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:01,360
It means, you know what I mean. Look at you. This is what your entire life is spent on bettering

515
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:06,800
yourself physically, emotionally, psychologically, mentally. You're obsessed with performance.

516
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:11,280
You're obsessed with being better. You're obsessed with being happier, more fulfilled,

517
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,840
all of these things. It's a pursuit of your own greatness.

518
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:18,560
There are structural disadvantages that are faced by men as well, right, that very few people

519
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:25,040
are willing to accept at the moment. Socioeconomically, men are falling behind, education, employment,

520
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:30,000
mental health, we're currently suicide awareness, suicide prevention week in the UK.

521
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,520
According to one of the guys I was literally talking to, half an hour ago,

522
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,760
if you are a man, the single biggest threat to your own life is yourself.

523
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,800
You are more likely to die by your own hands than by any other way.

524
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:47,760
Are you? Am I? I've got suicide in my family, so...

525
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,560
I know, but I don't think you are the greatest threat to you.

526
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:51,360
That's true, but...

527
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,600
And I'm not the greatest threat to me, and why is that?

528
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,400
Not everybody has the same genetic predisposition.

529
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:02,880
Sure, but you just said you do, and yet you're not the greatest threat to you. Why is that?

530
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:08,000
Because you're fulfilled, because you are successful, because you're striving and achieving,

531
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,280
because you have in life what you should have in life,

532
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,200
the meaning and purpose and the pursuit of a goal, right?

533
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:19,760
And for men, this is one of the problems with this mental health conversation.

534
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:24,240
One of the reasons that men's mental health is not as good as it could be is that,

535
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:30,800
A, we do live in a society which discourages them from being men,

536
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,880
and being the way that men are supposed to be.

537
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:39,600
But the other reason is that most of the personal development and psychology fields

538
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:46,720
are geared towards female ways of being, and most of the ways that we treat, for example,

539
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:51,040
depression, men don't need the same thing as women do when it comes to that.

540
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,800
What men need is to feel powerful and capable, right?

541
00:49:54,800 --> 00:50:01,680
The reason you are not the greatest threat to you is that you feel in charge of your life,

542
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:05,760
right? And that's what men need to pursue with every fiber of the being.

543
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,440
That's what I mean when I say better. You need to struggle, and you need to fight,

544
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,840
and you need to achieve. And then all of this other shit falls by the wayside,

545
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:17,360
and it's always been like this. I'm someone who's been depressed at points in my life,

546
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:21,360
and it's not because I was having a mental health problem, it's because my life was shit,

547
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:28,880
and I was shit. That's why, right? So what men need is to pursue their dreams,

548
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:35,040
to fight and struggle and to achieve. There was a point that you brought up earlier on about how

549
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:44,960
no guidelines is liberating and terrifying altogether. And I think it's interesting to talk

550
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:51,440
about how there isn't only one way to be a good man, but there aren't an unlimited number of ways

551
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:58,080
either. And the problem of breaking open the expectations around men means that guidance

552
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:04,320
for men and boys also largely dissipates. I had this conversation in Qatar, and the guy I was

553
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:08,320
debating had this conception of the man box. And he said, if you're inside of the man box,

554
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:12,800
it can be constraining because he was a member of the LGBT community,

555
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:17,440
Kuwaiti American group in the Middle East and wanted to be a dancer as a boy. I imagine it's

556
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:22,240
pretty fucking difficult for you to find a man box that fits that conception of you in it.

557
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:22,880
Sure.

558
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,920
But if you completely blast it open and you can be anything that you want to be,

559
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:31,120
there's no guidelines at all. There's no guidance. So how fucking hard is this going to be? You've

560
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:37,360
got to reinvent from first principles what it means to be a man. And I mean, you've heard this

561
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:43,600
from Mary Harrington and Louise Perry, but a lot of the guidance that was given to men previously

562
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:50,240
around chivalry, it is simply a difference of degree, not a difference of kind to go from

563
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,760
men should hold the door open for women and make sure that she gets the front door safe at night

564
00:51:53,760 --> 00:52:00,160
to you shouldn't hit your wife. It is one single thread between those, which is women

565
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:07,840
are more vulnerable and should be protected, right? Lovely conception that Mary in classic

566
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:15,760
Mary style said the bourgeois rules that benefited women who had had a partner that

567
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:20,080
grew up in a two-parent household that went to some highfalutin institution,

568
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:25,520
was around people that had good male role models. Yeah, sure. You can break open the doors of

569
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:30,160
chivalry and maybe pay for the first date or maybe you can drive yourself home or get the

570
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:34,000
taxi on your own or whatever it is, because the environment that you're in is largely very different.

571
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:40,240
The guy that grew up or the woman that grew up in a relationship with a man who comes from a

572
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:45,760
single-parent household whose mom or dad was addicted to alcohol or drugs or there was multiple

573
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:49,920
partners coming through the house, they never got taught not to beat your wife,

574
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:54,960
let alone not to hold the door open. And like the rules for the, but not for me, it's like

575
00:52:54,960 --> 00:53:01,680
the rules for us protect everybody, not just me. And yeah, I think it's a really interesting

576
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:07,600
frame to think about where the cultural changes come from. A lot of the time they come top down,

577
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:11,840
but the environment can be so different that getting rid of something that seems quite innocuous

578
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:16,000
up here can actually cascade down to the bottom. And the same thing goes for this tyranny of the

579
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,320
minority again. Absolutely. There are people that will be outside of the man box and maybe we

580
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:26,240
should expand it so that they can fit in it. But if you blow the doors open, where's the guidance?

581
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,840
Like what does it mean? And this is also a consequence of luxury beliefs, which is Rob

582
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:36,080
Henderson's term. I'm sure you've had him on the show. And the principle luxury belief of our time

583
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:41,200
is there's no difference between men and women. That's a luxury belief. There are people who

584
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:45,440
can afford to have it, but most people can't afford to have that belief. And then all else

585
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:49,840
follows from this. Because if you accept that there are differences between men and women,

586
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:55,520
then men and women should act differently. And that also means that it's okay for men to be men,

587
00:53:55,520 --> 00:54:02,080
and it's okay for women to be women. One of the things that I find really fucking weird, man,

588
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:10,720
since we had our son is people will go to my wife, oh, you're just at home. And I'm like,

589
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:16,240
what do you mean just at home? Are you fucking insane? She's raising our son

590
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:25,600
and providing everything that we need as a family. And that you're calling that just a thing.

591
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:34,320
But a lot of women will judge other women for just being at home. And actually, I think,

592
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:41,120
and it doesn't apply to everybody, caveat. But for most women, the greatest gift their partner

593
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:45,280
can give them is opportunity if they want to be at home with the children to do that.

594
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:50,240
About 85% of women say that being a stay-at-home mum is an opportunity,

595
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:54,160
an option that they aspire to have. Yes. And financially, for most people,

596
00:54:54,160 --> 00:55:00,320
it's very difficult right now. So it's the greatest gift. And so it's not just like men

597
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:06,640
are treated badly or women, it's this whole dynamic hurts everybody. And so men and women

598
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:11,040
need to work together. Dads need to be involved in their kids' lives. These are some, yeah,

599
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:14,480
they look their trad points one-on-one, if that's what you want to call them. But it's what works.

600
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,520
It's what works for the kids. It's what works for the family.

601
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:23,680
Did you read the Men Are Lost Can We Find a Way Out of the Wilderness article by Christine Ember,

602
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:28,640
who's in the Washington Post a couple of months ago. Was Washington Post? It's in the something.

603
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:33,440
Anyway, she had this beautiful conception in it that said many young men feel that

604
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:38,720
difficulties are often dismissed out of hand as whining from a patriarchy that they don't feel a

605
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:45,040
part of. It seems like a lot of modern men are being made to pay for the sins and advantages

606
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:49,360
of their fathers and grandfathers. And I thought that that was very interesting that

607
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,640
kind of like in comedy, right? You're allowed to punch up, but you can't punch down.

608
00:55:55,120 --> 00:56:00,320
And because men have had it good for so long, you have this concern in giving them any sympathy.

609
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:07,840
And even though largely pick most of the extreme negative outcomes that you want in life,

610
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:12,240
apart from sexual assault, and you're going to find a man on the receiving end,

611
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:17,040
whether it's homelessness, drug addiction, violent crime, mental health, being in jail,

612
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:26,320
suicide, like all of it. And there was this video of a, I think it was a trans man,

613
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:34,080
so a woman who became a man or looked like a man or whatever, who was absolutely horrified

614
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:38,560
by the lack of attention. Oh, people cross the street when they were walking.

615
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:43,120
It wasn't even just that. It's just like people ignore you. When you're a woman, you get attention.

616
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:48,480
And people just ignore a guy most of the time for most intense and purposes.

617
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:53,040
But those are, in my opinion, in erratical differences between the sexes,

618
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:58,000
the way our biological roles are, when women are going to get more attention.

619
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,880
I think you can definitely see, listening to your, pull yourself up by your bootstraps kind

620
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:08,160
of mentality, especially when it comes to men. You can definitely see that sort of Soviet,

621
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:13,200
like man be hard, man lift thing, man protect woman. That was actually money and a throw,

622
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:19,760
but that's the best rush you can get now. Yeah, I think that you can see that. And this is why

623
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:24,560
there's a multiplicity of opinions about how to do this. And I think it's why it's interesting

624
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:29,520
that everybody can contribute in it. Give me a critique of what I'm saying. I'd love to explore

625
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:34,160
that with you. There's nothing that I would disagree with massively. I think that it's

626
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:38,560
important to recognize the structural disadvantages faced by men and boys at the moment, going from

627
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:43,440
a brawn based to a brain based economy, when you have a disposition to be less conscientious,

628
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:48,720
where you are put into an education system that doesn't suit the disposition of boys,

629
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:56,720
but you're graded in the same manner as an entire sex who does boys are naturally going to fall

630
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:01,360
behind. And I think that you're seeing the outcomes of this in the way that schooling

631
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:09,520
and between the ages 21 and 29 women earn a grand and a bit more than men do. The gender pay gap

632
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:15,360
isn't a gender pay gap, it's a mother pay gap. That's the penalization comes to mothers.

633
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:19,520
I don't disagree with any of that, but the question is what's the answer? What's the solution to that?

634
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:25,360
I think that creating a positive view for masculinity, creating, and this is again why

635
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:30,400
Peterson and Andrew Tate as well have been so successful because they said, you can be something.

636
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:35,680
You can actually step out there and wrangle the world and I believe in you and I'm proud of you

637
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:41,760
and it's not wrong for you to try and want to get mastery or conquer something or achieve something,

638
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:46,160
have ambition, to be able to make decisions easily and stand up well under pressure like,

639
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:49,200
you know, these are all fucking good things that are not only good for you, but they're good for

640
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:53,040
the world as well. I think that there needs to be a positive vision, that would be one.

641
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:58,080
I think that that creates a positive feedback loop for men. I do think that there's some manning

642
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:06,480
up in the most transcendent and include like Wilburian way that we can, but I also think that,

643
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,760
you know, we need to look at structural initiatives that can help boys and men

644
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:17,040
because there's no other group on the planet who, when they fall behind, are pointed out and said,

645
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:21,040
this is your problem, you need to sort it out. Every other group, we would spend billions in

646
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:25,680
taxpayer-funded money to create committees and charities and initiatives that actually work

647
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:30,720
out what's going on and help them boots on the ground to be able to do this. I don't think,

648
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:36,240
like, if a man has a problem or if a woman has a problem, we say, what can we do to fix society?

649
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:40,800
If a man has a problem, we say, what can a man do to fix himself? Now, maybe that's the fundamental

650
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:47,120
asymmetry at the heart of the sex difference, but in a society that has surplus resources

651
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:54,640
that can help, I don't see why we wouldn't afford the, why we would make men unnecessarily swim upstream,

652
00:59:54,640 --> 01:00:04,240
if that makes sense. It does make sense. However, I think that my view is what you said earlier,

653
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:12,240
it's the fundamental asymmetry between the sexes. Now, it's true that all groups face various

654
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:18,800
structural inequalities. For example, I'm 5'9", barely. And do you play basketball? Not very

655
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:24,240
well, I should say, for that reason alone. Actually, if you look at the evidence,

656
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:31,680
heitism is one of the biggest openly available forms of discrimination that isn't condemned

657
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:37,840
or dealt with in any way. And one of your team is Scouse, so that must be...

658
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:40,000
He's even shorter than me, believe it or not. It must be awful.

659
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:47,840
Yeah. So, what's the answer to that? My answer to that has not been to get leg extensions,

660
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:52,880
or to complain about structural heitism. Do you know that like...

661
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,240
Structural heitism.

662
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:58,640
You joke, but if you want to play this fucking game, this is my point.

663
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:02,720
I'm not laughing at that, I'm just... Structural heitism is a term that I haven't heard before.

664
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:07,920
So, if you look at the CEOs of the top Fortune 500 companies, like 90% or something,

665
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:13,360
don't quote me on it, you can look it up. A very, very, very significant portion of them

666
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:17,520
are over six foot tall. Almost always the taller president wins, I think as well.

667
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:21,360
Right. Now, is the answer to that, not in Russia, by the way.

668
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:28,880
In Russia, you don't need that. So, do we complain about that?

669
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,880
Should we complain about that? Should I sit here and be like,

670
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:35,280
Oh, because I'm five foot nine, I don't get the... It doesn't help anything,

671
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:40,160
it doesn't change anything. And I remember it's so funny because I have a friend of mine,

672
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:45,760
he was like a Green Party voter, the most woke person that you could possibly imagine.

673
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:50,400
And he is like five five. And I made this point to him, I said,

674
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:55,200
yeah, but you talk about only structural issues with this group and that group and whatever,

675
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:58,640
and you're five five, did you know about heitism or whatever? And he was like,

676
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:06,080
yeah, but being five five has just made me who I am. I was like, yes, yes, you are what you are.

677
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:11,280
The world isn't going to change to you. My favorite scene in Game of Thrones,

678
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:15,680
have you seen Game of Thrones? Is Tyrion, when he's talking to Jon Snow and he calls him a

679
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:20,320
bastard and Jon Snow takes offense and he goes, have I offended you bastard? He goes,

680
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:27,680
let me give you some advice, bastard, never forget what you are. The world won't wear it like armor

681
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:32,960
and it can never be used to hurt you. That's the answer to all of this, right? And you're right

682
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:36,640
about Peterson and Tay who I think are very different figures, but nonetheless, their success

683
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:40,800
is based on the fact that they're telling men what men do need to hear in that respect, which is,

684
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:46,320
it's okay to be a man. It's okay to have drive. It's okay to have ambition. It's okay to have

685
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:51,680
aggression. It's okay to want things. It's okay to want status. It's okay to want money. It's okay

686
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:56,720
to want power. These are all things that are okay. They have pathological side effects when

687
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:01,600
not handled properly, but the drive to achieve, the drive to succeed, the drive to dominate,

688
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:07,120
the drive to win, these are good things and pursue them. And by the way, here's the interesting

689
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:14,240
bit. Those woke women, they love that shit. This is what I'm going to teach my son, right?

690
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:18,240
Whatever the society tells you about how it's wrong to be a man, at the end of the day, they're

691
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:23,920
all going to reward you for being a real man. This is the best time in some ways to be a real man

692
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:30,000
because you clean up. The competition is outing itself, is taking itself out of the picture.

693
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,640
If you act like a man, you clean up. That's the position we're in.

694
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:40,720
Well, there's a number of left-leaning women who are lamenting the fact that they can't find

695
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:49,760
a man who meets both their political preference and also will woo them appropriately on the date,

696
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:54,400
right? It's like, why are all of the men who do the things that I want from the other political

697
01:03:54,400 --> 01:04:00,160
party? I think it's like 30% or 40% of Democrats and Republicans fear that their son or daughter will

698
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:04,720
marry somebody of the opposite political belief. This tribalism that we spoke about earlier on.

699
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:08,480
Speaking about toxic masculinity, as part of that debate, I did a little bit of preparation

700
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:13,440
and I found some of my favorite headlines of things that are toxic masculinity.

701
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:20,080
Mass shootings, gang violence, climate change, the financial crisis is toxic masculinity, Brexit,

702
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:25,040
the election of Donald Trump, not wearing a mask, eating meat, physical fitness, fast food,

703
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:30,560
capitalism is toxic masculinity and communism is toxic masculinity, hip hop, smelling of

704
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:35,520
ax body spray, which is links for the British people, being stoic, risk-taking, religion,

705
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:42,080
but also secularism and atheism, playing board games, being interested in cars and saying hello

706
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:47,600
or have a nice day, all toxic masculinity. I'm saying hello is fucking atrocious, mate.

707
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:53,600
Yeah, that's sort of, I think that's part of the male gaze. There was this,

708
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:57,840
I think it was a rule, was it not put on the London Underground for a while that

709
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:02,720
like the men's wandering eyes or something, that was a concern. But here's another thing,

710
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:05,600
right? I'd be interested to get your take on this. I brought this up with that same

711
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:11,200
fitness influencer a couple of weeks ago, Sarah, really good response as well.

712
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:22,960
Internet incidents, big ones. People in the real world use the response of the Internet.

713
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:27,520
They crowdsource their sense-making to how other people responded. So you'll have seen

714
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:31,280
these Jim TikToks of girls videoing themselves, working out, and sometimes there's a guy in

715
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:35,200
the background. And if the guy looks over a bit much, because for whatever reason, he's looking at

716
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:38,880
her, he's looking at the camera, he's looking at himself, he's doing whatever. Sometimes they make

717
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:44,560
a big song and dance about it. The first big one of those that happened, it could have gone either

718
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:47,760
way. You could have tossed a coin and I would have said, I don't know. The Internet may say that

719
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:53,360
this is reprehensible. I thought it was fine, but I could have seen the Internet going on the

720
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:57,520
other side of the fence and saying, sure, find this guy, dox him, shoot him, blah, blah, blah.

721
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:08,240
It didn't. And that now has created a new bar of behavior, expected behavior, both for men and

722
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:14,400
for women. The interesting thing that it made me realize is the women who saw that TikTok,

723
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:18,720
had it have gone the other way and had it have been completely reprehensible and totally not

724
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:28,720
allowed, would then have reset their worldview expectation way more sensitive. Their radar is

725
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:33,600
now looking for, did that guy glance over three times or more in the space of 90 seconds? If so,

726
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:40,960
this equals a dangerous situation, because the Internet told me so. And it's a very sort of

727
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:46,880
slippery slope in one direction only. It only moves towards more sensitivity, not more robustness,

728
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:50,800
right? I thought that was interesting. Perception is projection.

729
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:59,120
What's that mean? It means that you see what you expect to see. You perceive your own projections

730
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:05,760
of the world. You had that fucking hyper viral moment about the scar makeup. Tell it again for

731
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:10,000
the people that don't know. So they did an experiment where they told a group of women that

732
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:15,040
they're going to put scarring on their faces or visual disfigurements of some kind. And then they

733
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:20,720
would go into an interview. And the purpose of the experiment is to work out whether the interviewer

734
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:26,240
is going to treat them differently because of their facial disfigurement. What they didn't tell the

735
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:30,640
women is as they were leaving to go for the interview, they touched up their makeup and

736
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:36,800
without showing them the facial disfigurement removed the scarring. So they went into the

737
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:42,400
interview thinking they're facially scarred, but they weren't. And they came back reporting massive

738
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:47,680
levels of discrimination, specific comments that the interviewer had made about them that they

739
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:54,320
perceived. So you see what you expect to see. This is why teaching people victimhood is so

740
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:59,440
dangerous because it makes them victims. It makes them expect certain things and then they will

741
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:03,680
react differently. I mean, you know, police interactions are a good example of this. If

742
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:08,000
you expect the police are going to treat you badly because of who you are, you're going to act in a

743
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,800
different way and therefore cause more problems. And I say this to somebody, you know, I was a very

744
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:19,760
angry young man and my wife used to piss me off so much. She would constantly say, like,

745
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:24,160
I'd get into an argument with somebody and I'd be like, that guy's a prick. He did this. And she'd

746
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:28,400
be like, you are creating those situations. You know that, right? And I was like, no, you're

747
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:32,880
forever. And it took me like a good 10 years to work out. Absolutely, I was.

748
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:39,200
Absolutely, I was. Right? So we perceive the things that we put out into the world. And this is,

749
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:43,840
you know, Peterson talks about this is you can't see without hierarchy because your brain has to

750
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:50,160
know what to focus on. And what you focus on is a function of the filter that you project onto the

751
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:54,480
world. I'm focusing on you now instead of the bookshelf behind you. I could have been sitting

752
01:08:54,560 --> 01:09:00,560
here picking out a good book this entire time. It's been a waste. But so that's what's happening

753
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:04,320
there. But it's interesting. I mean, I said something at the time, I was like, look, these

754
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:09,200
creepy men need to stop staring at women in gyms. Otherwise, they're going to stop wearing lingerie

755
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:15,600
to go there and then everybody loses. And what I'm trying to make is that like, you know,

756
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:20,160
this is a very, I'm going to say something very controversial here, Chris, you ready?

757
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,400
Men are attracted to women.

758
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:28,720
I've heard about that. Let's sit with that for a moment. I've heard about that. So, you know,

759
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:36,240
this idea that you're going to be barely clad, and men aren't going to notice that.

760
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:43,200
Sorry, that's not what our brains are for. Our brains are for looking at your ass. That's what

761
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:48,400
they're for. That's what they evolved for. I know it's crudely put. I learned the term for this new

762
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:54,400
style of gym short. It's got what's called a butt scrunch. Right. Have you seen the butt scrunch?

763
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:58,720
Yes. Right. Yeah, you're a married man. Online. Of course. Yeah, someone showed me a photo. I

764
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:04,240
tried to look away. Yeah, which is for the people that haven't seen it and aren't training in gyms

765
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:09,840
with like 20 year olds in, it's like a normal pair of shorts, training shorts for a girl,

766
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:15,600
like kind of tight. But then it's got kind of like a thong bit that separates the ass cheeks out,

767
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:22,320
which has been normalized very quick. Do you remember the first time that wearing just leggings

768
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:28,960
became a thing? Because I do. Because it wasn't when I went to uni. So it was after 2006. It was

769
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:34,400
after, maybe it happened while I was at uni. So maybe before 2010. But I remember thinking, wow,

770
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:40,400
that's like, that's like everything on display. That's kind of like, kind of like no pants.

771
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:44,560
But then also kind of not. And then now it's like, oh, that's kind of like

772
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:50,880
no pants. Well, like that's kind of like just a thong, but blue or like purple or lilac.

773
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:54,880
I feel you've dedicated a lot of time to describing this accurately, which I appreciate.

774
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:59,520
I mean, casual ornithologist on the side. I wanted to tell you about this.

775
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:06,240
Can I say some just on that before you move on? Because I think we sort of like,

776
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:12,560
we're trying to pretend things all the time, which, yes, men shouldn't be pigs.

777
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:18,720
We can all agree on that. But in order to not be a pig, I first have to see your ass that you've

778
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:26,480
shoved in my face. So I see it. I am then after that, not a pig. But I see it. And it's there.

779
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:32,960
And my brain isn't calibrated or designed or evolved. I mean, the sole purpose of our genes

780
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:37,440
is to reproduce, right? How is that just what I'm saying? Well, there's a female frame that's

781
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:44,800
placed around this conversation specifically that I don't think fully, maybe goes far as to say,

782
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:53,680
like sympathizes with the male brain reward system. There is an inbuilt reward system that men have

783
01:11:53,680 --> 01:12:00,400
for looking at sexually gratifying objects, even things like two rocks that look a bit like boobs.

784
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:03,840
Right? What's the first thing a boy does when he gets a calculator?

785
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:10,480
Right boobs. Yep. Now, is that because of toxic masculinity or is that because

786
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:16,880
men evolved for millions of years throughout evolutionary history, including pre-human animals,

787
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:22,720
to seek the opposite sex and the drive in males is just overwhelmingly strong? Now,

788
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:30,160
once you have noticed that, how you act is where culture and society and civilizing men

789
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:35,600
comes in, right? Just because you saw someone's ass doesn't mean that you're allowed to go and

790
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:43,360
stare at it or grab it or whatever. But you saw it. And you're not... It's almost like it happens.

791
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:48,480
And then you're like, okay, I need to... Fuck, yeah. Yeah. That's how it works. Now, what do

792
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:54,160
you want me to do about that? What are you supposed to do about that? I'm open to suggestions.

793
01:12:55,040 --> 01:13:01,360
Blinkers. Blinker men. Big... Some people would be in favor of that. The big veil that goes over the

794
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:06,000
top. Right. A little bit of inside baseball for people who aren't familiar with what's going on

795
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:10,640
in the podcasting world. And apparently this one's slipped by you as well. Theo Von and other

796
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:16,640
significant podcasters allegedly defrauded of approximately $4 million and then calls out

797
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:22,400
the fraudster in a video. In an unexpected turn of events, Colin Thompson, the man who was working

798
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:27,840
under cast media and with Theo Von, is accused of orchestrating a fraud operation that cost Theo Von's

799
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:33,840
podcast this past weekend and potentially other podcasts an estimated $4 million. Theo Von and

800
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:38,800
his crew detected inconsistencies in their payments, which is when trouble started, advertisers

801
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:43,360
allegedly paid Colin Thompson and cast media directly, leaving Theo with less money than

802
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:49,680
anticipated. And I know, from my side of the fence, that there are quite a few other podcasts

803
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:55,840
that were with this particular company. And it seems like this gentleman has been living a good

804
01:13:55,840 --> 01:14:02,080
life. Meanwhile, he's been robbing Peter to pay Paul to keep on cycling this through photos of

805
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:08,720
Lamborghinis and nice houses allegedly. And people aren't happy. And then Theo did a 10 minute video

806
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:17,520
that said, sorry, brother, you messed with the wrong rat. And this video, I think within 24 hours,

807
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:24,720
it hit a mill, plays photos of the guy, all the rest of it. So ructions, ructions in the podcasting

808
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:33,440
world. I can't wait to be able to be defrauded of $4 million. That's my dream goal to get to that

809
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:40,640
position. Yeah, you got to be careful, man. You got to be careful. That's why what we're building

810
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:44,400
trigonometry and we've got some big plans beyond just trigonometry itself is

811
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:50,000
bringing cool people together, but doing it under our own steam, under our own umbrella,

812
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:55,360
having everything managed by us with the right values and the right team. It's really important.

813
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:01,360
For the people that don't know how podcast advertising works, I handle almost all of my

814
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:07,040
big partners as well, directly. But a lot of the time, there'll be an agency that sits in between

815
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:11,600
you and them invoicing is kind of hard. Oh, there's an IO and did the deliverables get done and how

816
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:15,920
many numbers did that podcast hit and so on and so forth. And also, who's advertising at the moment?

817
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:20,320
Oh, there's a new company in town, maybe we can increase the costs or the price that we're charging

818
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:23,840
for this all that like it's messy and it's back and forth and whatever, whatever, especially if

819
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:28,560
you're doing lots of little deals as opposed to how I have it, which is a small number of larger

820
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:33,440
partners. And yeah, you have these guys that sit in between you and them classic agency model,

821
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:36,480
it's like a modeling agency, right? Like you have a model, there's your talent, you have

822
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:41,200
clients that want models and you take a bit off the top, take somewhere between 10 and 25%

823
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:46,640
depending on who the partner is and how big the deals are. But they hold the money, like they

824
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:52,640
get paid the money from the advertiser and then less they're cut, they'll pass it down to the

825
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:58,240
podcaster. These podcasts are largely run, I mean, you'll get your YouTube AdSense revenue,

826
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:02,640
which is not nothing, but fucking hell, it's not what you're making from your proper partners.

827
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:09,520
And yeah, if I don't know, man, I mean, it's such a it's obviously you can chase these people down

828
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:12,880
for like, we're going to fucking get them for fraud, but they're just going to declare bankruptcy,

829
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:19,120
you're fucking moved to the Cayman Islands or whatever. So yeah, I feel this is the first

830
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:26,000
time that we've seen a big case like this, which is slap bang in the bullseye of the

831
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:29,840
of our world, right? It's the first time that this has happened. And

832
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:35,520
kind of surprising it hasn't happened before, but hopefully it's a formative experience that

833
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:42,560
that's one other thing. If you want to fuck some people over for $4 million, don't fuck people over

834
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:46,400
that have a combined reach of 20 million YouTube subscribers, you know what I mean?

835
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:53,440
Absolutely. No, it's not a smart move. But look, I think we're sort of living through a wild,

836
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:58,480
wild west of the internet. I mean, actually, the wild, wild west of the internet is over,

837
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:02,720
but the podcasting world, it's very new. So there's going to be a lot of this shit going on. I

838
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:07,920
imagine this isn't an isolated incident, actually. So yeah, I think we all got to be careful and

839
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:14,800
smart about how the way we build, we build things that we build. Rule Britannia. Rule Britannia.

840
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:19,520
Rule Britannia. Come on, mate, you're actually British, unlike me. I'm trying. Rule Britannia.

841
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:23,760
At last night of the proms, hijacked by activists waving EU flags.

842
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:28,960
The site of hundreds of European Union flags. The last night of the proms have prompted an

843
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:34,000
outrage from Brexiteers and a call for the BBC to investigate those waving the EU flag.

844
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:38,560
And the Royal Albert Hall appeared to outnumber those waving the Union flag at the event,

845
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:43,040
which is usually a patriotic display following a campaign by pro Europeans. The spectacle of

846
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:49,040
so many EU flags being waved as the whole belted out rule Britannia provoked disgust

847
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:56,560
from leading Eurosceptics. What's going on? That's from the Guardian.

848
01:17:56,560 --> 01:18:04,160
I voted to remain in the referendum and I've largely, I don't know if I've changed my view

849
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:09,120
of that, how I would vote, but my view of that issue has evolved so much precisely by seeing

850
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:15,280
these fucking morons who just completely are incapable of understanding what democracy means.

851
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:22,160
Democracy means that when you lose, you accept it. There's some other parallels for that particular

852
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:30,320
statement. When you lose, you accept it. And we've had for the last seven years, these just

853
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:37,200
absolute fucking lunatics running around acting like what democracy means as they always get their

854
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:46,560
way. And they have to insert this into everything. They've just become obsessed. And it's mind boggling

855
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:52,400
to me. How we're still talking about Brexit is mind boggling to me. I don't get it.

856
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:57,440
Yeah, that's insane. It's insane. That's like a Eons old talking point now.

857
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:02,000
I think if you are still talking about Brexit, your brain is broken.

858
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,200
When do you think that rule gets applied to COVID?

859
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:16,480
I think that with COVID, I actually said this before COVID was over and in this instance,

860
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:19,840
I get things wrong all the time, but this was something that turned out to be right,

861
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:26,000
that people will want to forget very quickly. And they have done. Even I want to move on from

862
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,920
COVID. We talked about it earlier, but I don't have any great desire to talk about it. Most

863
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:36,800
people have moved on without learning the lessons of the thing. So I think the reason to still talk

864
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:43,520
about COVID is that there is a future pandemic coming and we ought to learn the lessons of this

865
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:50,880
one while we still can. With Brexit, it's a political decision that is not reversible unless

866
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:55,280
you have another referendum, which in which case you're free to campaign to have another referendum

867
01:19:55,280 --> 01:20:00,720
if that's what you'd like. I'm not sure showing up with EU flags at the proms is the way to achieve

868
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:04,720
a second referendum. I'm not a political expert, but that's my type.

869
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:11,520
Yeah. There is a resurgence of activism occurring at the moment, but it's always in criticism of

870
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:18,000
stuff. So George Mack, one of my friends, highlighted that the last time that there was a

871
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:23,840
ticker tape parade for someone that wasn't healthcare professionals in America for

872
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:33,360
something, not against something, was Nelson Mandela in the 90s. So you have a culture of

873
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:42,720
activism and of public displays of passion, however, can only be against something,

874
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:45,520
while people are only choosing to do it against something.

875
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:55,120
And people respond to incentives. What's that saying? Ever a great cause begins as a movement,

876
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:57,840
becomes a business, and eventually it degenerates into a racket.

877
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:04,320
And there are many people in this country who made a career out of being prominent

878
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:11,840
remainers. And when Brexit was over, what are you going to do? So they just carry on.

879
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:17,680
And the people, they feed this crap like having this crap fed to them. So they just,

880
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:25,120
they keep going. It's a reward incentive-based system because it's a pointless conversation.

881
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:30,640
You're not going to change the result of the referendum. Even if you succeeded in proving

882
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:36,240
that Brexit was a bad idea, it's already happened. So you can argue for a second referendum or

883
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:41,520
another referendum if you want. But that's it, right? But talking about how shit Brexit is,

884
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:47,760
isn't about achieving a result beyond your own personal enrichment satisfaction status, etc.

885
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:53,600
And Femi, this Marina Perkus woman, there's a shit ton of these people on Twitter whose only

886
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:57,920
thing that they do is talk about Brexit and get thousands and thousands of views.

887
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:05,200
Yeah, it makes me sad to think about people who, I know there's one incident that occurs,

888
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:11,840
especially like public stuff, like some catastrophe or news stuff, like people that

889
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:16,560
are still talking about Madeleine McCann. Do you know what I mean? Like I understand

890
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:20,000
fucking terrible situation, but there are people whose entire lives I want-

891
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,040
I mean, they are her parents.

892
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,000
I once stepped into-

893
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:37,840
Fuck's sake, Constantine.

894
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:42,720
He was there. You left an open goal out to me.

895
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:50,960
Yeah, you can take the comedian out of comedy. I once descended. I got hit with the fucking

896
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:56,160
like blast radius of these two investigative journalists. I had them on the show when

897
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:59,840
the disappearance of Madeleine McCann came out on Netflix. And these were the two main people,

898
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:02,160
her husband and wife. And I brought them on. I thought,

899
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:05,040
fucking hell, like these are the two, these are the fucking experts. These are the guys that

900
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:07,840
Netflix went to. They must be like fucking legit, you know what I mean?

901
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:15,920
Brought them on. Turns out there is an ardent fucking group of people who really do not like

902
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:20,880
them on the internet. And I was a part of like Madeleine McCann law for a couple of weeks,

903
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:25,520
because this guy has platformed these people that we know they're a part of the,

904
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:29,520
like whatever the fuck cover up scheme and they didn't know the thing that went on.

905
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:33,200
Do you haven't read the original police report from Portugal or wherever she was from?

906
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:39,280
And it's, there's part of me that thinks like noble cause you're chasing after it.

907
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:44,720
It's part of me that thinks, holy fuck, you've been captured by this one thing,

908
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:49,360
like this one incident has just completely controlled your life forever.

909
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:55,520
I mean, the one thing that doesn't get set off and enough is, you know,

910
01:23:55,520 --> 01:24:01,440
there's a certain proportion of society that's not mentally well, massively overrepresented online,

911
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:06,720
right? So I think a lot of people are just, you know, it's, it's, it's an obsession of theirs or

912
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:11,680
whatever. You don't get to see what's driving. This is what I often think when I'm reading

913
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:16,800
Twitter replies, because I'm like, well, these people are like, you know, normal and right,

914
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:20,960
and most of them are, of course they are, but like you read something weird and then I sort of like

915
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:25,920
go, okay, let's imagine what sort of circumstances I would have to be sitting in to write this.

916
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:29,920
And then I see that picture and I go, okay, this makes sense. You know what I mean?

917
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:36,080
Like when I see people saying really crazy shit, I'm like, so this, I just think what we forget

918
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:41,200
sometimes is a lot of people are, you know, in that situation. I was telling you about this

919
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:46,160
preventative medicine place that I've been to in America. So it's called Fountain Life.

920
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:52,560
And I did a podcast with the founder forever ago and thought, that sounds fucking cool. Didn't

921
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:56,160
really know what preventative medicine was, although it's kind of encapsulated in the name.

922
01:24:56,160 --> 01:25:02,720
And I ended up getting like everything done. Full body MRI, CT scan, heart angiogram, brain

923
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:07,920
angiogram. I need to do that, man. Full works. Yes. I will 100% link you with them. One of the

924
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:15,280
things they do, I think it's called contrast. So you're hooked up to an IV, which is like a

925
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:20,800
mechanical IV. So when they press a button, just shit goes into you. So they've got you in the

926
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:25,760
fucking cannula or whatever it is, they've got the thing in there. And then there's this huge,

927
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:31,840
big wheel spinning around you unbelievably quickly. So you're kind of an MRI machine,

928
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:36,240
it's a little bit more open and this huge fuck off wheel that's obviously like scanning shit.

929
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:44,560
And then this, they pump stuff from this machine into your vein. And it lights up your heart

930
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:51,440
it goes into the ventricles of the heart while this thing's in a very specific position

931
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:57,760
over you and blah, blah, blah. But the felt sense of it is heat starting in your neck

932
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:02,640
and going only through your torso doesn't touch any of your limbs going only through your torso

933
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:08,800
and finishing in like your bladder. And then it cools off around your bladder for about 20 seconds.

934
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:15,200
It is one of the strangest fucking experiences. It's not unpleasant, strange. I would definitely

935
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:19,200
wouldn't even say it's that unpleasant, to be honest. It's like, must be what feeling like a

936
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:24,880
dragon is like, just fucking heat moving around inside of you. So yeah, that was very interesting.

937
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:27,680
I can't wait. Preventative medicine though, we were saying it before.

938
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:34,240
Playing a game where you try to catch up to a disease that's already happened

939
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:42,720
by design is a losing fight, right? Absolutely. No, I think that seems to me to be the future

940
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:48,160
of the direction that we're going is like looking into genetic predispositions. I know people who

941
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:53,680
are having procedures because they know they have a certain risk, etc. Chris Hemsworth found out on

942
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:59,440
that discovery documentary that he's got, I think he's got genetic predisposition to alximers.

943
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:04,560
So he's spending way more time with his family and he's doing other things. He adjusted his entire

944
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:08,880
life because I might not be able to remember this. Should learn a second language. That's protective

945
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:12,720
against alximers? People who speak multiple languages are much less likely to have it.

946
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:21,360
I wonder... Which way the causal effect works, I don't know. But I imagine exercising your brain

947
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:24,560
in multiple ways is helpful to protecting yourself against things like that.

948
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:34,080
Yeah, I don't know, man. There's a multiplicity of ideas about how we're supposed to live our lives.

949
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:41,360
And in some regards, it's amazing. The promise of free access to information 24 hours a day,

950
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:47,280
all of human civilization's knowledge at your fingertips, that combined with the falling

951
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:53,920
away of the gatekeepers and this loss of trust in institutions actually makes for really fucking

952
01:27:54,800 --> 01:28:01,520
disquieting journey for a lot of people. Because who do I trust? Do your own research?

953
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:06,800
Fuck, I've got a life to live. I've got to try and... To the family and the kids and the house

954
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:13,280
and the dog and the me and you want me to... I've got to go and do my own... Give me the medical

955
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:16,960
journal. I'm going to go through this, whether it's about health. Are carbs good? Is sugar good?

956
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:20,320
What about... Should we be eating more butter? What about meat? Is meat killing me or should I go

957
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:26,560
vegan? What about paleo? Libert King says I need more testicle and it's everything.

958
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:33,760
I'll see you and I'll raise you, which is what if the way for you to live your life that's optimal

959
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:40,560
is different to mine? My wife's very into Ayurvedic medicine and that's the entire concept of it,

960
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:46,000
is the different types of people that need different food, different times that they eat,

961
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:55,440
all sorts of different things. A lot of it is experiential. When I found out that you could

962
01:28:55,440 --> 01:29:02,000
just eat protein and greens, I was like, whoa, this is amazing and that's what I do. I have carbs

963
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:07,360
every now and again, but it fits how I am wired and my wife's the exact opposite.

964
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:15,440
She's water, wind, you're fire. Fire is the lead for me.

965
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:19,440
Anton. Anton's wind. Francis. Water.

966
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:25,200
Knew it. Bloody water. It's pretty obvious. Bloody water. Water is great if you can get it off the

967
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:30,880
sofa. Then it's like a bowl rolling down the hill. You can't stop it. It becomes unstoppable,

968
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:34,960
but it's a fucking hard... It takes a lot of fire to get water off the sofa.

969
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:40,960
Yeah, I was fascinated. He taught me about this in Austin when we were hanging last time. I thought

970
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:48,080
it was really fascinating. He taught me as well, ambient water, ambient, not refrigerated water,

971
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:56,000
should avoid drinking cold water too much. Yeah. That's their way. That's how they see it. I'm

972
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:00,000
by no means an expert, but generally, ingesting cold things is not good for you.

973
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:05,280
Yogurt. I love yogurts so much, though. Dairy also not great, as I understand it.

974
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:09,920
I mean, look, I'm not supposed to eat red meat and I mostly red meat, so you break the rules

975
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:15,200
sometimes. Yeah. But no, I understand what you mean, that different strokes for different folks.

976
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:19,120
But fucking hell, even if there can be different strokes for different folks,

977
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:24,160
I should be able to find a source that can... I'm this kind of a person, therefore, I can do this

978
01:30:24,160 --> 01:30:34,800
kind of a thing. This is where the... If I was more conspiratorial, I would say that the goal of a

979
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:41,840
messy information landscape is not to convince you of any one narrative, but to convince you that

980
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:50,880
no narrative can be trusted. And it seems to me that if I was maybe even in a various domestic

981
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:59,520
actor wanting to make a sort of nihilistic, fatalistic, placid, not compliant, but just like

982
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:06,960
surrendered populace. Well, you know the rat electrification experiment, right? Where they

983
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:13,600
put a rat in a cell where the floor gives them an electric shock. And what they found was,

984
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:19,120
in psychology, this is called... What's the term? Learned helplessness? Yes. This is the

985
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:26,880
Learned Helplessness Experiment, where if the rat is able to end the electric shock by pressing a

986
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:33,360
button, then the rat will continue to do that. If the rat has no control over the electric shock,

987
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:39,200
it will just lie down and take it, right? So I think this... What you're talking about is a system

988
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:44,720
that creates learned helplessness in people, which is one of the reasons... While, of course,

989
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:49,040
it's super tempting to bash the mainstream media and they deserve a lot of the bashing,

990
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:55,120
we need a media ecosystem that's trusted. We do need politicians who can be trusted.

991
01:31:55,680 --> 01:32:01,760
I'm not happy with the status quo that we've got the moment where we trust no one and with good

992
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:06,880
reason. But the solution to that isn't to trust the mainstream. The solution is for the mainstream

993
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:11,520
to become trustworthy. Yeah. Do you think that's even possible? I think it's very difficult in the

994
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:17,120
modern environment. It's very, very difficult because I just see that us, we're running a small

995
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:22,560
media organization, just you are too, right? It's like, do you get everything right? Is your

996
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:27,840
research always on point? So it's very, very difficult. Interesting what you said earlier about

997
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:34,400
there are certain things that they're able to do that we're not, like fact-checking and stuff.

998
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:39,040
They're also, because of how they're incentivized and subsidized and the expectations,

999
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:48,880
like non-sexy stories, digging into weather and accounts and stuff, tell me which

1000
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:56,080
YouTube channel is going to predict tomorrow's weather. No one, right? Not sexy enough. Too much

1001
01:32:56,080 --> 01:33:02,240
of a cost to be able to do. And no one's saying the fucking Met Office, they're captured by the

1002
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:06,560
woke. Although there was that thing this year, right? Where they made most of Europe look like

1003
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:10,720
it had turned to ash because anything over 35 degrees Celsius meant that it was like

1004
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:16,480
the blackened end of a cigarette. So maybe there is a little bit of fuckery going on.

1005
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:22,160
Yeah. Well, there is a lot of fuckery going on. What's interesting is I find the climate issue

1006
01:33:22,160 --> 01:33:28,880
absolutely fascinating. It's genuinely fascinating to me because the historical ignorance on that

1007
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:34,320
issue that is being deliberately spread is like mind-blowing to me. Do you know the Romans when

1008
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:42,160
they occupied Britain? They grew grapes on Hadron's Wall. Hadron's Wall for people listening used to

1009
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:49,760
protect England from what is now England from what is now Scotland, right? One of the

1010
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:53,920
northernmost points on the British Isles. Now, if you don't know Scotland,

1011
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:58,160
fucking cold. It's average weather in, I used to live in Edinburgh for seven years,

1012
01:33:58,160 --> 01:34:03,440
average weather in Scotland in August is like 18 degrees and rain at best, right? So

1013
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:14,240
what we are being told about that issue is absolutely mind-blowingly, incredibly

1014
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:18,880
unhelpful and inaccurate. Wasn't there, I think it's still around somewhere in London

1015
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:23,600
or somewhere in the South Coast, 40 miles inland from the coast, there's ports.

1016
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:28,880
Pevensey Castle. Yeah. Pevensey Castle, you go there and they're like, yeah, the sea used to be here.

1017
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:37,200
I don't see this. 2000 years ago. Yeah. So this whole conversation is very, very odd to me and

1018
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:42,880
after my Oxford speech went viral, I had a lot of invitations to go and speak to different people

1019
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:47,440
and I was talking to this guy who works for the Indian government at a high level and he told me

1020
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:54,960
when India became independent in 1947, average life expectancy was 37 years old in India and

1021
01:34:54,960 --> 01:35:01,920
today it's I think 82 and that's because they burn fossil fuels. Now, are we saying to a billion

1022
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:06,800
plus Indian people they're not allowed to do that anymore? Do you know what I mean? Like the way we

1023
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:13,120
talk about this issue, just it's a cult. It doesn't make any sense. It doesn't make any logical sense.

1024
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:16,880
The things that are being suggested that we do don't make any sense. The way we're approaching,

1025
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:22,080
it doesn't make any sense. It's incredible to me the way this conversation is being had

1026
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:27,280
and I'd love to understand, you know, Eric, who you just had on, he always says this, like

1027
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:32,480
we're lying about the climate for the wrong reasons. Do you know what I mean? Like his

1028
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:37,520
point is climate change is happening and it's a serious issue, but we're lying about the way

1029
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:44,800
to deal with it and lots of other things around it. That's one of the most weird things to me about

1030
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:51,360
what's happening. Like Bjorn Lomborg during that, oh my God, heat wave, we're all going to die,

1031
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:55,760
posting stuff about, you know, like actually the number of forest fires is the lowest it's ever

1032
01:35:55,760 --> 01:36:02,160
been and the number of hurricanes in America, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And I would love

1033
01:36:02,160 --> 01:36:06,400
to know what's going on with that shit. I would love to know. Do you need theories?

1034
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:13,680
Well, one thing that's interested me a lot is obviously people are familiar with the concept

1035
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:20,800
of group think, but there's another thing which is the Abilene paradox. I don't know if you're

1036
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:26,560
familiar with it. It's basically the idea that people will often do things because they think

1037
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:32,320
other people want them done. And you combine that with mass panic, indoctrinating kids into being

1038
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:39,200
terrified, et cetera. And I also think human beings love a doomsday narrative. And a portion of the

1039
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:43,120
sort of side that I've been arguing on, which is this anti-work side, is like the barbarians at

1040
01:36:43,120 --> 01:36:48,000
the gates. Now, I genuinely think that's true. I think we are undermining the founding pillars

1041
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:53,840
of our civilization, but there is an appeal to that worldview. And if you look back, neither of us

1042
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:58,800
are old enough, but in the 1970s, the planet was cooling and everybody was terrified of global

1043
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:04,480
cooling. Terrified. Terrified of the population bomb. Absolutely. Now we're terrified of the

1044
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:09,360
depopulation. It's what we love. We love to think. And I think there's a kind of like,

1045
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:14,400
we live in special times. Oh, like a mass solipsism. Yeah. Yeah. Like, look, look,

1046
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:18,720
last 2000 years, shit has happened and you had Jesus in World War II and whatever,

1047
01:37:18,720 --> 01:37:23,520
but now is the real time when shit is happening. And he knows, maybe it is happening.

1048
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:28,960
Not on this issue, I don't think. But yeah, the idea that we are living through a climate catastrophe

1049
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:34,160
seems highly suspect to me. Highly suspect. But also somehow very sexy. Very sexy. Now,

1050
01:37:34,160 --> 01:37:37,840
that's not to say the climate isn't changing. The climate is changing. But the question I think

1051
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:43,360
we also ought to be asking is, is the climate changing a bad thing? Well, climate-related

1052
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:48,320
deaths have decreased by 50 times over the last 100 years. That's Alex Epstein's he

1053
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:52,640
been under. Yes. We haven't had him on, but yes. Oh, dude, you guys will fucking love him, right?

1054
01:37:52,640 --> 01:38:00,560
I'm sure. He's an interesting dude. Climate-related deaths have decreased by 50 times. More people

1055
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:05,200
are killed by cold weather than hot weather. Yes. Way, way, way more. And we know that because

1056
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:10,240
this is the thing about the idea of pursuing net zero is it makes energy more expensive.

1057
01:38:10,240 --> 01:38:16,880
That's the method by which you achieve this to some extent. And pensioners freeze to death

1058
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:21,280
every winter in this country. Now, that doesn't seem like a good thing to me. I don't think

1059
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:26,800
making energy more expensive for poor elderly people and them freezing to death on their own

1060
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:31,280
in their homes in the winter, I don't think that's what, I don't think if we were setting out to

1061
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:35,600
improve the world, that would be one of the ways that we'd do that. But because we're trade-off

1062
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:40,160
denialists because we refuse to understand that actions have consequences good and bad,

1063
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:49,680
we ignore that. And this hysteria, it's cut like and I find it very strange. I find it very strange.

1064
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:54,480
Whatever you think about the climate issue in and of itself, our response to it is strange.

1065
01:38:54,480 --> 01:39:00,560
People are just looking for a cause, right? Yeah. And this is why COVID was so captivating

1066
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:07,360
on both sides because it gave us a righteous war to wage. And again, when you've got a

1067
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:12,160
multiplicity of ways that you can go with your life, the man box has been blown open.

1068
01:39:12,160 --> 01:39:16,080
Nobody says that you should be this for masculinity. Maybe I don't even need to get

1069
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:20,720
into a relationship. I can just boss bitch or like incel my way through the next however many decades

1070
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:26,960
of my life do all this sort of stuff. Ah, here's a single vector along which I can move. I'm no

1071
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:32,480
longer in an open field. I'm on a set of railway tracks. And yeah, you know, Peterson had the

1072
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:38,880
ordering chaos, like paradigm out there. It feels like there's a fucking hell of a lot of chaos and

1073
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:44,160
not a massive amount of order for people. And then the people that live in chaos land and prefer

1074
01:39:44,160 --> 01:39:48,960
that look at the people in order land as tyrants and the people in order land look at the people

1075
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:54,240
in chaos land as fucking vigilantes. And yeah, it's, it doesn't surprise me, man. You know,

1076
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:59,520
and this is where I said to Eric, I wish that I'd got Eric to watch the Sam episode

1077
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:03,360
before he sat down with me because it was difficult for me to

1078
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:09,120
portray a three hour conversation in 20 seconds. But I don't think that those guys are too far

1079
01:40:09,120 --> 01:40:13,360
apart. Like Eric saying we've lost faith in our institutions, but we can't get rid of them.

1080
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:21,360
Independent media is both advantageous and not going away. But we fucking can't like

1081
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:26,240
outsource our sense making to them as well. How do we live in this new world? What does success

1082
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:30,800
look like in this regard? I thought it was fucking interesting. Look, I think we're living in a,

1083
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:35,760
this is a metaphor that is overused, but it's sort of the invention of the printing press kind of

1084
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:42,320
situation. I mean, that caused two centuries of religious war. So I think what the social

1085
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:47,040
media in particular and the internet more broadly has done, it is as broken our ability to make

1086
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:52,480
sense of the world and we are all reaching for a way to do that. I think it's going to take some

1087
01:40:52,480 --> 01:41:01,280
time and it's not going to be without consequence. And it's interesting because the argument about

1088
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:07,600
free speech is made very complicated by the existence of social media because there are people

1089
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:12,560
who say they're free speech absolutists. I've never called myself that because I don't believe

1090
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:16,800
anyone is a free speech absolutist. What's your conception on free speech? Give me the

1091
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:22,240
framework. Well, think about this. So Elon Musk says he's a free speech absolutist. He buys Twitter

1092
01:41:22,240 --> 01:41:29,280
and then the moment people trigger his personal preferences, he shuts that particular form of

1093
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:34,080
conversation down when it was about children or something like that, so spreading something.

1094
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:40,080
I think he said it about Alex Jones or whatever. Anyway, my point is X, Twitter, whatever has a

1095
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:48,960
moderation policy because it has to because the technology is so powerful. I'll give you

1096
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:54,320
both sides of the argument, right? But the argument for moderation as in content moderation

1097
01:41:54,960 --> 01:42:02,720
is that the technology is so powerful if you can start an assault on the Capitol or an undermining

1098
01:42:02,720 --> 01:42:07,600
of an election or whatever it is or a riot or a mass shooting or whatever. If you can start that

1099
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:14,400
from your phone, the technology is too powerful to be left uncontrolled. I have a lot of sympathy

1100
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:20,880
with that argument. However, let's flip it the other way around. You live in the United States,

1101
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:24,880
now a country for which I have a tremendous regard and the history and the formation of the country

1102
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:29,680
is very interesting because it creates a country that is fundamentally very different to every

1103
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:38,240
other country that's existed before. Do you get 1776 if there is Twitter and it's moderated?

1104
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:45,040
I don't think you do because who would allow a revolution to happen? You think King George would

1105
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:53,040
allow the spreading of misinformation, right? So we are stuck in this place where on the one hand,

1106
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:57,520
yes, free speech is absolute and is really super important. On the other hand, actually,

1107
01:42:57,520 --> 01:43:03,200
most people, it's very easy to be a free speech absolutist until you're in the hot seat making

1108
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:09,280
the decision and imagine you are in the hot seat and you've got the CIA, the FBI, the heads of

1109
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:14,640
government, whoever's your friends coming to you and going, if you don't do something, people are

1110
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:19,600
going to get killed and they are going to get killed and that's on your conscience. It's up to you,

1111
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:26,400
right? So it's a very, very difficult thing with the power of the technology that we have that has

1112
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:34,400
the ability to multiply information, narratives, opinions, whatever to such an extent. So we have

1113
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:40,560
not worked out how to handle that at all and everybody who says they have a solution to it,

1114
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:45,280
I'd love to see them be in the hot seat for a day and then we'll see how absolutist they are about

1115
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:51,040
free speech or how pro censorship they are because there's a flip side to the coin which is you do

1116
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:58,000
moderation, you're going to get accused of bias from both sides, right? So I don't have no envy

1117
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:01,840
for those people. Now, I do think they've made a shit ton of mistakes. I'm just saying, I suspect

1118
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:07,520
I probably would have done too. Yeah, Sam had an interesting analogy where he was saying, if I

1119
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:16,400
spend five years building up the waking up social media platform and I want only Nazis to be allowed

1120
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:21,520
on it, I should be allowed to only have Nazis on my social media platform or the inverse. I should

1121
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:26,880
be allowed to kick Nazis off. It's not my job to have people I don't want on my social media platform.

1122
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:33,040
And this comes back to the pipeline versus public service argument. I mean, there's a very strong

1123
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:37,360
counter argument to that argument, which is the one you've just made, which is once you've captured

1124
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:42,320
the entire market, you're a monopoly and we regulate monopolies for a reason, which is

1125
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:50,480
to be kicked out of the local pub does not prevent you from going and having a drink in a pub. To be

1126
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:54,720
kicked off Twitter prevents you from communicating in that element of the public square.

1127
01:44:54,720 --> 01:45:01,360
Has there been any, there's usually concerns around monopoly. Has there been any of that

1128
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:06,240
to do with online platform? Is there such a thing as too big of an online platform? Like fucking

1129
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:14,000
Facebook and TikTok and YouTube have got like, you know, large portions of the planet as users.

1130
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:20,240
So this is a new category in that regard. Absolutely. The banks got so big that they

1131
01:45:20,240 --> 01:45:26,560
needed to be split up. You take large things and make them into smaller things, right?

1132
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:30,720
But you can't not with this because no one wants to be on the third best Twitter. Nobody wants to

1133
01:45:30,720 --> 01:45:35,280
use the third best Google, right? You do it, you split them off and then everyone just converges

1134
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:39,600
back on which is the biggest one. The monopoly is what makes it valuable. The fact that it's on

1135
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:45,120
there is what makes it valuable. That's why Elon Musk bought Twitter rather than building his own

1136
01:45:45,120 --> 01:45:50,560
from scratch. Because he has the money to build his own Twitter, but you just can't drag people over

1137
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:56,400
enough. So the monopoly is the point. This is why it's such a tricky thing. The new category of

1138
01:45:56,400 --> 01:46:04,320
business. That's why it's the point. With sort of frictionless gravitation

1139
01:46:04,880 --> 01:46:13,680
toward whichever thing you want to choose to use, people will always converge on the biggest,

1140
01:46:13,680 --> 01:46:20,080
the best, the whatever one. Whereas, yeah, if Jim Shark gets two and a half billion

1141
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:26,320
users or to customers and they say, you need to split up into Jim and Shark, right? Or Lloyds and

1142
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:32,960
TSB. It's not quite the same. Not everyone's going to converge on this particular one.

1143
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:37,200
It's interesting. One of the analogies I used to use from my nightclub days,

1144
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:45,600
and Twitter's kind of like this. In nightlife events, it's one of the only industries where the

1145
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:52,880
other users of the product are the primary value of the product itself. So if you ask one of your

1146
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:57,840
friends on your 20s, mate, how was last night? And they'll say, mate, it was amazing. So many

1147
01:46:57,840 --> 01:47:04,160
girls in that club. No, I asked you how your night was. I didn't ask who were the other people that

1148
01:47:04,160 --> 01:47:10,160
went to the event. You don't say, why do I use an iPhone? I use an iPhone because David Beckham's

1149
01:47:10,160 --> 01:47:14,480
got an iPhone. So I use an iPhone because the camera and the apps and the battery life and

1150
01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:19,040
stuff like that. But nightlife was very, very interesting in that way, which is why it was

1151
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:25,920
so mimetic. It's the same reason why, I'll open this up to you, internet, some industry secrets

1152
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:30,880
here. Sometimes nightclubs hold cues and sometimes they make the cues thinner than they need to be.

1153
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:34,640
So they look really long and then they take a photo because it looks like it was busy.

1154
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:39,040
We did that. We did that all the time. We still do. It's Freshers Week next week in Newcastle.

1155
01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:44,400
It's exactly what every single nightclub will do. But you have that same thing with regards to

1156
01:47:44,480 --> 01:47:50,800
the social media as well. The other users of social media largely determine your experience on it,

1157
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:58,320
which is why Rumble is this and Truth Social is whatever, right? Is there a left-leaning?

1158
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:04,560
Well, they had one, Mastodon, didn't they? I don't know what happened, which tells you quite a lot.

1159
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:09,120
Speaking of Mastodon, I had a guy called Ben Lam on the show. He's the CEO of this company called

1160
01:48:09,120 --> 01:48:16,080
Colossal. He is using ancient genetic information to bring the woolly mammoth back to life.

1161
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:22,800
Within 20 years, we will have actual woolly mammoths walking on this planet. So they found,

1162
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:27,200
in the Arctic, very good for preserving DNA. They found bones and all sorts of other stuff.

1163
01:48:28,160 --> 01:48:34,000
Mammoth carcass remains. From that, they've taken, I think it's maybe 40 or 50 different because you

1164
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:37,920
don't get a full DNA sequence in any one of them. Then they've brought them all together,

1165
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:45,840
used AI to fill in the little gaps. They're then going to implant a, whatever it's called stem cell,

1166
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:53,200
pluripotent stem cell, inside of the Asian elephant. So an Asian elephant will give birth

1167
01:48:53,200 --> 01:48:59,360
to a woolly mammoth. And then after a sufficiently long amount of time, they'll get placed up north.

1168
01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:04,960
And they can do all sorts of awesome stuff for helping to fertilize the Arctic. And he also

1169
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:09,360
wants to bring back the dodo bird. The interesting reason he wanted to bring back the dodo bird was

1170
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:16,320
the reason that the dodo bird was killed off was because of unsustainable hunting practices.

1171
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:22,160
So you'd think that the mammoth has a real function. The dodo bird, people laugh at it for

1172
01:49:22,160 --> 01:49:26,080
being this stupid pigeon that couldn't fly away. But maybe it was because of the introduction of

1173
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:31,120
a particular predator or whatever. Yeah, it might have been ecological imbalance that was done by

1174
01:49:31,120 --> 01:49:36,560
manmade. And his point is mammoth does a thing. It's like the farmer of the Arctic.

1175
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:45,280
Dodo bird is like a symbolic representation of, do you see all of the work that we had to

1176
01:49:45,280 --> 01:49:50,080
fucking go to, to bring this thing back to life? Be more careful when you introduce invasive species

1177
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:55,440
into different ecologies. I was like, fucking hell. And he's super fired up about it. I found

1178
01:49:55,440 --> 01:49:58,240
him really charming. So I had a conversation with him the other day. I thought that was cool.

1179
01:49:58,240 --> 01:50:01,760
So they're going to bring back prehistoric animals. I think I remember seeing a movie about

1180
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:09,520
that. I did say, you know, how far back can we go? Real problem, bones and teeth don't

1181
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:13,840
hold much genetic information, which is a fucking massive shame. But we can do stuff like

1182
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:19,440
sabertooth tigers, like particular types of sabertooth cats. I was asking him, what else

1183
01:50:19,440 --> 01:50:25,520
did he want to bring back? There was this huge fucking sloth, this massive thing that it was

1184
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:30,160
like the largest marsupial. They live like on an island, but there were no predators.

1185
01:50:30,160 --> 01:50:37,360
I think so. Yeah, this gigantic fucking sloth. So there's like a laundry list of different

1186
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:43,360
ridiculous megafauna prehistoric animal, prehistoric, like deceased. It's called de-extinction

1187
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:49,760
extinct animals that he wants to bring back. I just thought like between that and preventative

1188
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:56,640
medicine and AI. What do you thought on AI? How are you feeling? Are you fucking scared

1189
01:50:56,640 --> 01:51:01,760
that you're going to lose your job to GPT-6? I'm not scared I'm going to lose my job. No.

1190
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:11,280
He's going to make a very significant impact on the world, but what that's going to end up looking

1191
01:51:11,280 --> 01:51:17,600
like, I don't think anyone really knows. I think there's probably, there's a lot of fear porn about

1192
01:51:17,600 --> 01:51:21,840
it and it may be justified or maybe I don't have any profound thoughts about it. I think

1193
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:27,440
if you look at human history, people always use technology for basically the same things,

1194
01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:34,480
right? Getting laid, killing each other, etc. So you'll produce amazing porn,

1195
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:39,360
you'll produce amazing weapons, you'll produce amazing everything and then human beings are

1196
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:44,720
going to do what they always do, I think is the truth, right? Like I remember, I think it was

1197
01:51:44,720 --> 01:51:48,000
Desmond Morris, I used to read a lot of his books. I don't know if you're familiar with them,

1198
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:51,440
but it's one of the things he talked about. He said like when you dig up a clay tablet

1199
01:51:51,440 --> 01:51:58,800
in Egypt from 4,000 years ago, you read it is basically the same shit that we talk about now.

1200
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:04,240
My son doesn't write to me or doesn't visit me or whatever. Human condition doesn't change.

1201
01:52:04,240 --> 01:52:10,800
The tools we use to express it do. I saw a report from an ancient stone tablet

1202
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:17,520
from I think Egypt or ancient Rome that was a justification for why this

1203
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:21,520
employee hadn't turned up to work. It was a sick note that he'd written and it's this

1204
01:52:21,520 --> 01:52:27,600
fucking elaborate story about what happened and the wife and there was a catastrophe and all

1205
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:32,080
this stuff and yeah, you do realize that human nature is pretty fucking resilient over a long

1206
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:36,480
enough period of time. But coming back, here's another thing I'll say about the free speech

1207
01:52:36,480 --> 01:52:44,720
conversation, which is that we haven't made nearly an honest enough case about free speech,

1208
01:52:44,720 --> 01:52:50,080
which is why we're having a stupid debate about it, because no one wants to say the truth,

1209
01:52:50,080 --> 01:52:57,600
which is free speech has consequences that are bad. There are people who say

1210
01:52:57,600 --> 01:53:03,040
are atrocious, horrific shit. There are people who will use the opportunity to be on a social

1211
01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:10,240
platform to mobilize and do terrible things. Now, there's a big conversation now about

1212
01:53:10,240 --> 01:53:16,400
whether there's a lot of antisemitism on X and actually there is. I have to block more people

1213
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:22,560
than I used to have to block to on Twitter, but I'm still in favor of that being allowed

1214
01:53:23,680 --> 01:53:28,080
because I'd much rather these people were in the open and people could see what they are and they

1215
01:53:28,080 --> 01:53:33,600
can have their conversation instead of going off into a kind of like a private place where it's just

1216
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:37,920
them and arguments are never challenged. So I think one of the things people don't say enough

1217
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:44,000
about free speech is yes, it causes harm, but the harm's worth it. And we don't make that argument

1218
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:49,360
because it's too honest and complicated and unpleasant and whatever. But the other side of

1219
01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:53,360
the argument is terrifying to me. I don't think I've told this story publicly, but last time I

1220
01:53:53,360 --> 01:53:59,200
did Question Time. Question Time is this big political discussion program here in the UK.

1221
01:54:00,640 --> 01:54:07,600
Before they show, they do a warm-up question that's not recorded and it's not released.

1222
01:54:07,600 --> 01:54:14,400
So it's like a warm-up. And the conversation at that time was Donald Trump had just been

1223
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:21,840
unbanned on Facebook and they were asking whether that was okay. And they went to me first and I

1224
01:54:21,840 --> 01:54:26,080
was like, look, not that I'm his biggest fan, but I do think the former or sitting president of the

1225
01:54:26,080 --> 01:54:30,800
United States should be able to speak in public. Yeah, I do. Controversial as that is. And then

1226
01:54:30,800 --> 01:54:35,920
they went around the table and whatever. And then they went to the labor woman who was there. Very

1227
01:54:35,920 --> 01:54:43,600
nice woman. And she without batting an eyelid went, I think we should have the safest internet in the

1228
01:54:43,600 --> 01:54:51,520
world. And I would say for the North Korea, right, this is coming back to this point about trade

1229
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:56,880
off denialism. Like they think safety doesn't have a price. And the other argument is freedom

1230
01:54:56,880 --> 01:55:00,480
doesn't have a price. And the truth is they both have a price. And what we're trying to find is

1231
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:07,040
the right point in the middle between those two. We want enough freedom and enough safety. And

1232
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:10,800
that line is somewhere in the middle. Because if you think about it, that's true of any issue.

1233
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:18,160
I can end murder outside of the prison system today. I can stop murder and rape. Do you want

1234
01:55:18,160 --> 01:55:24,480
to stop murder and rape? Yes. Okay, let's lock up all men between the ages of 15 and 40 until the

1235
01:55:24,480 --> 01:55:30,720
age out of it. You've ended murder. Right. But we don't do that. Why not? Because there's a trade

1236
01:55:30,720 --> 01:55:35,680
off between safety and freedom. And so it's the same of everything. And it's the same with free

1237
01:55:35,680 --> 01:55:42,080
speech. You mentioned Trump. What do you think happens in 2024? I'm not an expert on it, but

1238
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:50,240
it looks like they're going to try and put him in prison. And it also looks like he might win.

1239
01:55:52,480 --> 01:55:56,320
Is that possible? Yeah. Can both things happen? Can you be president from prison?

1240
01:55:56,320 --> 01:56:00,560
Yeah. You can be president from prison. Yeah. Fuck off. You can't be president from prison.

1241
01:56:00,560 --> 01:56:04,320
Look it up. You can be president from prison. Oh my god.

1242
01:56:04,320 --> 01:56:07,280
And you can run from prison. More interestingly.

1243
01:56:10,720 --> 01:56:18,480
I wonder, maybe if you are, I don't know, maybe you can't be president. You can definitely run

1244
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:22,640
from prison. Maybe you get elected and pardon yourself.

1245
01:56:23,360 --> 01:56:35,440
Right. So you're okay. Let's say, let's say that there's no prison. What happens? Presuming

1246
01:56:35,440 --> 01:56:40,240
that everybody is a... But why would we presume that? I mean, I think it's pretty clear that

1247
01:56:40,240 --> 01:56:45,680
that's what's going to happen. Okay. The path that they're on, it looks to me like they're going

1248
01:56:45,680 --> 01:56:51,360
after him. We just had to score Adams on the show. And this is, he said Trump needs to win

1249
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:57,440
to stay out of prison. That's what he thinks. And I also think that the other thing he said

1250
01:56:57,440 --> 01:57:01,840
is like, he actually interestingly said that he thinks Trump started this because when he talked

1251
01:57:01,840 --> 01:57:07,040
about Hillary and he said, I'm going to lock you up, they were like, oh, oh, you want to play?

1252
01:57:07,040 --> 01:57:11,360
Let's fucking play. So I think they're going after him now and they want to put him in prison.

1253
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:15,360
And I think they will. But you also think that he...

1254
01:57:15,760 --> 01:57:19,920
I think he'll win the nomination for the Republicans. Yeah.

1255
01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:24,480
And then it's, I mean, who the fuck? Look at the last election. Who the fuck knows what's

1256
01:57:24,480 --> 01:57:28,240
going to happen? But he can run from prison that much, I know.

1257
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:34,080
That's fucking insane. Vivek Ramiswani playing tennis with his top off whilst Trump's in prison

1258
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:39,760
as the Trump Ramiswani 2024 fucking thing. That looks like what it's going to be, right?

1259
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:41,600
I think that's what Vivek's going for. Yeah.

1260
01:57:41,600 --> 01:57:43,280
He's angling for it for sure. Yeah.

1261
01:57:44,080 --> 01:57:46,560
And who do you think gets nominated for the Democrats?

1262
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:50,320
Well, it's going to be Biden, isn't it? I mean, they're not going to abandon him.

1263
01:57:51,040 --> 01:57:51,520
Unless...

1264
01:57:53,120 --> 01:57:55,120
Well, he falls down a flight of stairs.

1265
01:57:55,120 --> 01:57:57,760
Yeah. And in his case, it wouldn't even be a conspiracy.

1266
01:57:59,760 --> 01:58:01,680
Who do you think's the running mate? Any idea?

1267
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:06,000
Nah, man. Look, let's be honest, neither of us is an act. Well, although you are now

1268
01:58:06,560 --> 01:58:08,160
an adopted American, so you probably...

1269
01:58:08,160 --> 01:58:10,400
An immigrant to that great nation, I know even less than you.

1270
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:16,720
You know, I try... The more people listen to what I say, the less I try and talk about things

1271
01:58:16,720 --> 01:58:22,000
I don't know enough about. I mean, that was a Douglas Murray thing. He was... Someone had asked him

1272
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:28,400
about two years ago, had asked him why he hadn't written many articles. He writes like four,

1273
01:58:28,400 --> 01:58:32,000
five columns a week. It's like 3,000, 4,000 words every week. And then his books and then

1274
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:35,120
his speaking on top. Someone had asked him something along the lines of,

1275
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:40,160
why haven't you commented that much on COVID? He says, I'm going to do something which is very

1276
01:58:40,160 --> 01:58:44,400
rare in the modern world, just to not comment on something which I know nothing about.

1277
01:58:45,040 --> 01:58:52,480
I thought, what a fucking beautiful and outlier philosophy to have. But this is...

1278
01:58:54,240 --> 01:59:01,200
I see this allure in myself and I have to check myself and probably fail almost all the time at

1279
01:59:01,200 --> 01:59:09,760
doing it. People start to listen to you about a thing or for a thing and you go, well,

1280
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:16,880
why shouldn't I comment on the Ukraine? Maybe my take on the Ukraine is

1281
01:59:18,240 --> 01:59:24,160
useful. Maybe the world does deserve to hear what my thoughts are about immigration crossing the

1282
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:29,760
channel. And then you realize... I mean, I've commented on both those things, but thanks mate.

1283
01:59:29,760 --> 01:59:35,760
But you are from the fucking region of the Ukraine and an immigrant to the UK, right?

1284
01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:42,000
That's a lived experience. Yes, exactly. I know exactly what you mean. Your point is very,

1285
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:47,120
very, very valid. It happens with comedians incidentally, which is why comedians political

1286
01:59:47,120 --> 01:59:52,800
opinions generally speaking are so demented. Because you stand on stage all day making other

1287
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:58,000
people throw their head back and admire you or be enthralled by you or whatever. And you're like,

1288
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:02,400
oh, maybe I do know something. Let me give you my opinion about Brexit. It's like, no,

1289
02:00:02,400 --> 02:00:06,080
no, just be the clown. Shut the fuck up. Now, that's why I don't do comedy actually,

1290
02:00:06,080 --> 02:00:12,000
it's one of the reasons. I was more interested in making a point than I wasn't being artificially

1291
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:17,600
funny. You know what I mean? And I always thought of myself more as a satirist anyway,

1292
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:23,040
which was a different thing. But yeah, being in front of a microphone imbues you with a level

1293
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:28,880
of confidence that is very often inappropriate. Right. It's like permanently being on

1294
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:36,880
oratorial Viagra. Yeah, if everyone's listening to me, I must be worth listening to. That's

1295
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:40,800
what happens in your brain. Regardless of what it is that I'm talking about, regardless of the

1296
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:47,760
format or the, yeah, I've got these live shows coming up towards the end of the year, November,

1297
02:00:47,760 --> 02:00:57,680
mid-November. That's awesome. Thank you. What's your advice for someone who have touring comic

1298
02:00:57,680 --> 02:01:04,160
played fucking thousands of shows across your career? What do people who haven't put that time in

1299
02:01:04,160 --> 02:01:09,920
on stage not know about how being on stage works? This is going to sound like a shit answer. But

1300
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:14,720
actually, it's stage time is just like air miles on the clock. Like with pilots, you have to fly a

1301
02:01:14,720 --> 02:01:21,840
certain number of miles. But I always think about whatever charisma, whatever else it is,

1302
02:01:21,840 --> 02:01:28,480
is really about a comfort with yourself in front of other people. Not everyone is equally charismatic

1303
02:01:28,480 --> 02:01:33,360
naturally, but if you're comfortable with who you are and you are able to do that while you're on

1304
02:01:33,360 --> 02:01:40,400
stage or in front of a camera or wherever, that's the magic ingredient. It's like my favorite quote

1305
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:44,800
is the most important thing in show business is authenticity. If you can fake that, you can do

1306
02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:50,720
anything. Authenticity is the key ingredient, which is why I think you've been successful. I think

1307
02:01:50,720 --> 02:01:54,240
it's why Joe is successful. I think it's why Francis and I have had the success we've had.

1308
02:01:54,960 --> 02:01:58,640
I almost feel, I don't know if you feel this, but the longer we go, it's like the more layers of

1309
02:01:58,640 --> 02:02:03,600
the undone we peel off to reveal more of who we truly are. Yeah, I would say so because

1310
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:13,840
you become more comfortable with things that you masked over before. Yes. There's uncertainty or

1311
02:02:16,080 --> 02:02:22,960
like nerdiness, I suppose, like unnecessary rabbit holes that you want to go down. And I've never

1312
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:26,480
had this before. Obviously, you had this and you may have had it before comedy, I don't know.

1313
02:02:27,600 --> 02:02:31,920
But I never had a single pursuit that I got to go as narrow and deep on as I have on

1314
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:37,680
having conversations with people. And when you really, really start to fucking like drill down

1315
02:02:37,680 --> 02:02:44,000
into, okay, what does mastery begin to look like? Which I'm not at, but I can glimpse.

1316
02:02:44,800 --> 02:02:48,080
I'm like, okay, what does that actually look like? What does that feel like? What does it look like

1317
02:02:48,080 --> 02:02:52,960
to make rules and then break rules and then put them back in again and do things? I'm talking

1318
02:02:52,960 --> 02:03:01,680
to some of the guys now I want to start doing slightly more scripted bits as a part of maybe

1319
02:03:01,680 --> 02:03:06,720
some of our ad reads as a part of maybe some of the intros. And that's like, if you actually look

1320
02:03:06,720 --> 02:03:11,600
at that, that's a very inauthentic way of doing what is supposed to be an unbelievably authentic

1321
02:03:11,600 --> 02:03:18,560
relatable medium. We're taking the rules from, you know, like sitcom legacy media to try and apply

1322
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:24,240
that to this. But I actually think that that's breaking rules that have been made. And the

1323
02:03:24,240 --> 02:03:28,960
reason you can is because you've learned them unbelievably well, right? It's not not knowing

1324
02:03:28,960 --> 02:03:34,080
the rules. It's disregarding them purposefully. And I'm just excited. I'm excited by all of the

1325
02:03:34,080 --> 02:03:38,880
different options and opportunities and ways that there's cool stuff to do. And it's fucking awesome

1326
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:44,000
to see what you guys are doing at Trigonometry. What I know about what's coming that more people

1327
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:49,360
will find out at some point over the next however long is fucking amazing. I think that the UK needs

1328
02:03:50,320 --> 02:03:57,040
a nice movement, a good conglomeration headed by people who understand this industry

1329
02:03:57,120 --> 02:04:01,680
that can be a platform for others who have amazing and interesting things to say

1330
02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:05,840
but don't yet have the platform that they deserve to be able to say them on.

1331
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:10,800
Well, this is what we've been working on for a long time. And I can't quite say exactly the

1332
02:04:10,800 --> 02:04:14,160
people and who are going to be involved other than to say they're going to be fucking awesome.

1333
02:04:14,880 --> 02:04:20,880
But we want to use the platform that we've built to make it so that Trigonometry is the

1334
02:04:20,880 --> 02:04:26,240
main show on that platform. But there will be other shows with other people and me and Francis

1335
02:04:26,240 --> 02:04:32,720
interspersed with other interesting, funny, hilarious, clever commentators, etc. So rather

1336
02:04:32,720 --> 02:04:36,960
than two Trigonometry interviews a week and some raw shows and a bunch of them,

1337
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:43,280
we've started doing a lot of scripted stuff ourselves, comedy. I often record my sub-stack

1338
02:04:43,280 --> 02:04:48,080
pieces now and we put them out as videos. We had a couple of really viral ones. One I did

1339
02:04:48,080 --> 02:04:51,120
about communism and fascism. You did one about Jordan Peterson recently.

1340
02:04:51,120 --> 02:04:53,520
I did, yeah. That one's done very well, surprisingly.

1341
02:04:56,960 --> 02:05:03,600
But also we want to start thinking about how I'm thinking about us now as a media organization.

1342
02:05:04,560 --> 02:05:09,040
That's my frame for what we're doing. I want to bring other people through, help them make

1343
02:05:09,040 --> 02:05:12,880
exciting content that fits with the values of what we do. There's going to be entertaining

1344
02:05:12,880 --> 02:05:19,840
for our audience. There's going to be informative and grow it over time into a real hub for awesome

1345
02:05:19,840 --> 02:05:25,840
content. That to me is a super exciting next phase of this because I think the media industry

1346
02:05:26,480 --> 02:05:31,920
that we are in, the new media industry, is going to change rapidly. One of the things I see coming

1347
02:05:31,920 --> 02:05:37,680
down the pipe quite quickly actually is consolidation. This idea that you're going to give five quid a

1348
02:05:37,680 --> 02:05:42,640
month to your favorite 70 creators, it's not going to happen. The admin alone will kill you.

1349
02:05:43,920 --> 02:05:47,920
People are going to want a place. Obviously our politics are very different, but the model

1350
02:05:47,920 --> 02:05:52,160
of the daily wire is, I mean, they've executed it incredibly well. I went to go and see them.

1351
02:05:52,160 --> 02:05:59,600
I filmed on Brett Cooper's show four, five months ago, something like that. Anna, dude, it's a

1352
02:06:01,600 --> 02:06:08,160
machine workshop for creating content. Over there is the merch team. All they do is make

1353
02:06:08,160 --> 02:06:14,640
fucking tumblers and designs for t-shirts. Here's an entire three by 10 row of editors all

1354
02:06:14,720 --> 02:06:21,040
working away. Millions of meeting rooms. Here's an entire different building with everyone's

1355
02:06:21,040 --> 02:06:27,360
studio in it. Here's a control center that allows us to edit anything at any time. I found this out.

1356
02:06:29,040 --> 02:06:35,840
I'll check that this is okay to say. Shapiro has got some special fucking landline thing,

1357
02:06:35,840 --> 02:06:43,040
some special type of connection that runs from where he is in Florida to where the hub is in

1358
02:06:43,040 --> 02:06:50,240
Nashville that allows them to cut his show live as if they were on site. Wow. I didn't know that.

1359
02:06:50,240 --> 02:06:55,680
I've been in that studio a couple of times now in Florida. I've been to that one, but I've been to

1360
02:06:55,680 --> 02:07:00,800
the pipeline where that shit ends up at. Yeah, I've been there too. It's impressive. It's very

1361
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:06,000
impressive what they built. Here's an interesting thing for you. Two analogous stories that I'm

1362
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:16,240
sure that you've thought about before. The slow dilution or fucking explosion of the young Turks

1363
02:07:17,280 --> 02:07:25,440
and Crowder Daily Why, that you're talking about congealing or bringing together.

1364
02:07:26,240 --> 02:07:33,200
Meanwhile, a lot of the groups and affiliations and organizations, IDW, largely disbanded,

1365
02:07:33,200 --> 02:07:39,040
that wasn't an organization though. Loose affiliation of people. Young Turks, you say the

1366
02:07:39,040 --> 02:07:42,560
wrong thing slightly and downstream from that. Some people on the network don't agree with

1367
02:07:42,560 --> 02:07:46,720
other things that you've said. Like fucking apparently Ben Shapiro was Crowder's first

1368
02:07:46,720 --> 02:07:52,800
ever lawyer or some bullshit as well and then they've split off and they're big C conservative and he

1369
02:07:52,800 --> 02:07:58,160
turns out that he bought the URL only a couple of months after they spoke, but months before he

1370
02:07:58,160 --> 02:08:04,320
announced that he'd recorded these phone calls and all this sort of bullshit. So I think that

1371
02:08:04,320 --> 02:08:10,240
sometimes we're too quick to try and pattern match stuff. Yeah. And it's like, oh, all organizations

1372
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:17,040
devolve into fractured individual groups or whatever, or all power becomes centralized

1373
02:08:17,040 --> 02:08:22,160
into one thing. It's like maybe it's just flux. Maybe it's just tides. Maybe there's like ebbs

1374
02:08:22,160 --> 02:08:27,520
and flows and stuff. Well, I think you're going to be able to continue to do what you do in

1375
02:08:27,520 --> 02:08:33,280
whichever way you want to do it. I'm interested in bringing people through who are very talented,

1376
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:37,200
but who basically what we had to do with trigonometry and one of the reasons I haven't

1377
02:08:37,200 --> 02:08:43,200
made there a few money is that we have a big team as you do, but we've always had a big team

1378
02:08:43,200 --> 02:08:49,280
because we wanted to create the foundation for what we're about to do. And so Francis and I

1379
02:08:49,280 --> 02:08:54,080
really don't make a lot of money from it because we're investing in the future. And what I want to

1380
02:08:54,080 --> 02:08:59,600
do is we've kind of created a factory for making content. I want to bring people in who don't want

1381
02:08:59,600 --> 02:09:05,600
to build their own factory, but who are very good as creators of making content. Yes, exactly.

1382
02:09:05,600 --> 02:09:10,480
I mean, Carl Benjamin, load the seat. Yeah, he's done that. Spanked it. Yeah, he's doing very well.

1383
02:09:10,480 --> 02:09:16,800
They're playing a game of monopoly around the fucking some like transport police bullshit

1384
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:22,720
somewhere in the country. And it's like they're slowly taking up the transport people have got

1385
02:09:22,720 --> 02:09:28,400
the corner office and got all of the ones that I decide. Apparently one of the guys was telling me

1386
02:09:28,400 --> 02:09:33,520
that he had some incident that had occurred at the railway line. He had some sort of stalker

1387
02:09:33,520 --> 02:09:38,160
that followed him at the railway line. And because it happened at the train station,

1388
02:09:38,160 --> 02:09:42,080
it's the transport police that pick up on it. And he rang them and the guy rang him back and he

1389
02:09:42,080 --> 02:09:44,880
could hear him through the wall. He said, mate, should I just come through, open the door and

1390
02:09:44,880 --> 02:09:48,480
was talking to the guy that was dealing with his case. It's like, fucking hell, that's interesting.

1391
02:09:48,480 --> 02:09:54,080
But yeah, you know, this, it's cool, man, it's cool. And it feels way more cool to see it happen

1392
02:09:54,800 --> 02:10:01,200
from grassroots, where you can watch episode one of some horse shit show.

1393
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:02,400
Thank you.

1394
02:10:02,400 --> 02:10:06,400
With terrible lighting, fucking audios all over the place. And no one knows what they're doing.

1395
02:10:06,400 --> 02:10:07,200
Ugly host.

1396
02:10:07,200 --> 02:10:10,560
Ugly host. Yeah, that wasn't shit. And then you work to the stage where you're like,

1397
02:10:11,600 --> 02:10:15,920
holy fuck, like I can actually see the full trajectory of this entire thing laid out in

1398
02:10:15,920 --> 02:10:21,360
front of me, as opposed to like, oh, fucking Rupert Murdoch and is it part of...

1399
02:10:21,360 --> 02:10:24,000
Shady McShade face invested a million dollars.

1400
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:27,520
Nameless fucking like hooded figures drinking adrena chrome dancing around a pentagram.

1401
02:10:27,520 --> 02:10:28,480
Yeah. Yeah.

1402
02:10:28,480 --> 02:10:29,760
That's where we want to go.

1403
02:10:29,760 --> 02:10:30,400
I understand.

1404
02:10:31,280 --> 02:10:38,320
No, but closing the loop on all of that, I just think this is the next phase in terms of what

1405
02:10:38,320 --> 02:10:43,200
we started with, which is let's stop whining about how we've been cancelled. You know, I think

1406
02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:49,760
it's been a thing of mine, which is like, we keep saying, well, the mainstream media isn't

1407
02:10:49,760 --> 02:10:51,840
doing this, then well, let's fucking do it.

1408
02:10:51,840 --> 02:10:52,880
Make your own mainstream media.

1409
02:10:52,880 --> 02:10:57,040
If you think that they're doing it wrong, let's fucking do it right. Let's do it.

1410
02:10:57,760 --> 02:11:01,680
And let's see who wins. That's the thing for me is like, I love the competition. I love

1411
02:11:02,480 --> 02:11:05,520
attempting to build new things, the creating the challenge of that,

1412
02:11:06,080 --> 02:11:07,840
working out how to run a business with...

1413
02:11:07,840 --> 02:11:09,680
Fucking immigrant mentality, man.

1414
02:11:10,320 --> 02:11:12,000
To me, this is the most exciting thing.

1415
02:11:12,960 --> 02:11:18,320
We were talking with good friends of mine last night about how much money you need to be happy.

1416
02:11:18,320 --> 02:11:23,120
And I was like, and somebody said that the statistics are $70,000 a year.

1417
02:11:23,120 --> 02:11:26,160
And maybe it's in like $2,000, but whatever.

1418
02:11:26,160 --> 02:11:28,560
Beyond that point, it doesn't really make any difference.

1419
02:11:28,560 --> 02:11:30,720
And I was like, well, for me, it does make a big difference.

1420
02:11:30,720 --> 02:11:33,520
And then I thought, you know what, what if I made a million dollars a year,

1421
02:11:34,080 --> 02:11:39,760
which is way more than I make now, but I wasn't having the experience of growing,

1422
02:11:39,760 --> 02:11:41,680
working with my friends, all of that.

1423
02:11:41,680 --> 02:11:43,680
And then I was like, actually, yeah, I don't think it is the money.

1424
02:11:43,680 --> 02:11:46,640
It's the doing it. It's the creating. It's the building.

1425
02:11:46,640 --> 02:11:53,360
This is why of all the people that I love to watch, I love Dana White interviews.

1426
02:11:53,360 --> 02:11:54,480
I was about to bring in Dana White.

1427
02:11:54,480 --> 02:11:57,280
He's a fucking... I just, I cannot wait to interview him.

1428
02:11:57,280 --> 02:11:59,440
You got him in America?

1429
02:11:59,440 --> 02:12:01,120
We are working on it.

1430
02:12:01,120 --> 02:12:04,720
So he's basically, he's open to it, but it's just about finding the right time.

1431
02:12:04,720 --> 02:12:06,080
As you can imagine, he's a busy guy.

1432
02:12:09,280 --> 02:12:12,400
I fucking love that guy. I love listening to the guy.

1433
02:12:12,400 --> 02:12:16,320
I love the way he dealt with COVID. I love everything about it.

1434
02:12:16,320 --> 02:12:17,520
You've seen that clip.

1435
02:12:17,520 --> 02:12:19,920
It went super viral a couple of times where he says,

1436
02:12:19,920 --> 02:12:21,840
bet against me. Fucking bet against me.

1437
02:12:21,840 --> 02:12:24,080
Tell me it's not going to work. I love that shit.

1438
02:12:24,080 --> 02:12:25,920
Every single time, man, like that energy.

1439
02:12:25,920 --> 02:12:26,880
I'm the same.

1440
02:12:26,880 --> 02:12:29,520
I really, really enjoy it. And I think that it's missing.

1441
02:12:29,520 --> 02:12:35,280
I think that there's not enough like conquerors in the world of personal development and business.

1442
02:12:36,480 --> 02:12:42,160
There is from a performative level, but I don't look at Dana White and think that he's saying

1443
02:12:42,160 --> 02:12:44,560
what he thinks sounds cool for people to hear.

1444
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:50,400
I think he's speaking his philosophy forward, which is one of,

1445
02:12:50,400 --> 02:12:52,480
stand on this hill, come and have a swing.

1446
02:12:52,480 --> 02:12:57,840
Yes. Yes. And I've always been like incredibly competitive.

1447
02:12:57,840 --> 02:12:59,200
I thrive on it. I love it.

1448
02:13:01,360 --> 02:13:05,360
One of the things, by the way, you've told me, I will say this, is you were the first British

1449
02:13:05,360 --> 02:13:12,800
podcaster who was in our space who, when I've met, has been from a, who had a growth mindset,

1450
02:13:12,800 --> 02:13:18,000
which is why I said when we first started, how unsurprised I am by the amazing success you're

1451
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:22,480
having because you've always had that attitude and it shows. And that's why you're successful.

1452
02:13:22,480 --> 02:13:28,800
And that's why you're friends with everyone in the industry. I just, I think it's a natural

1453
02:13:28,800 --> 02:13:33,040
concept. Your success is not an accident is what I'm saying at all. It's a natural consequence

1454
02:13:33,040 --> 02:13:36,880
of the person that you are. And Dana White inspires me in the way that I'm inspired by

1455
02:13:36,880 --> 02:13:41,520
your success as well, because it's just like, this is a guy who got his friends together.

1456
02:13:42,240 --> 02:13:46,240
They bought this thing for $2 million or whatever it was. At some point,

1457
02:13:46,240 --> 02:13:51,520
there were 30 something million in the hole and they just kept going until they crushed it.

1458
02:13:51,520 --> 02:13:54,160
And there's a lot of other things that they do very well. I think as a,

1459
02:13:55,040 --> 02:13:58,720
if you just switch on the fights on a Saturday night, you wouldn't see, but

1460
02:13:59,680 --> 02:14:06,640
they make it entertainment. They make reality TV shows out of the content. The way they present

1461
02:14:06,640 --> 02:14:10,800
the fights is like very well organized and it's beautifully shot.

1462
02:14:10,800 --> 02:14:16,480
Think about it this way. Think about what, if you watch boxing now, how fucking pedestrian,

1463
02:14:16,480 --> 02:14:23,200
unnecessarily ceremonial it seems. This fucking guy carries out a mace and Doth's cap and fucking

1464
02:14:23,200 --> 02:14:29,280
a list of 50 people who've donated money to this thing. We are here in the presence of the

1465
02:14:31,280 --> 02:14:35,440
by the Nevada state and the this and this and this. You're like, no, fucking just tell me the fight.

1466
02:14:35,440 --> 02:14:39,440
Yeah. Show me the fight. Give me the tail of the tape. Get me amped up. Let them punch each other.

1467
02:14:39,440 --> 02:14:45,280
And also what they've done incredibly well is with boxing, no one gives a shit about anyone on

1468
02:14:45,280 --> 02:14:51,680
the undercard or the card. They just care about the headline fight. UFC, the headline fight may

1469
02:14:52,240 --> 02:14:56,640
very often isn't the best fight that actually happens on the night. They'll be the best fighters

1470
02:14:56,640 --> 02:14:59,520
on the night, but it won't be the best fight. So you fight of the night will, I would guess,

1471
02:14:59,520 --> 02:15:03,520
only maybe 30% of the time go to the main car. Yeah. And it's just they, and therefore they

1472
02:15:03,520 --> 02:15:06,480
are building up other talent. This is what we're talking about with what we're doing. They're

1473
02:15:06,480 --> 02:15:11,920
building up talent who are not the headline fighters, but you're seeing them from an early

1474
02:15:11,920 --> 02:15:15,280
start and you follow them and you're like, oh, this person is getting better and they're fighting

1475
02:15:15,280 --> 02:15:20,880
this guy and whatever. So just from a business perspective, I am so inspired by that attitude.

1476
02:15:20,880 --> 02:15:26,640
I think it's, I love it. And I think we're probably going down very different paths in

1477
02:15:26,640 --> 02:15:31,920
that you've gone to America where that attitude is prevalent. I'd love to take it. Every time I go

1478
02:15:31,920 --> 02:15:36,880
to America, I come away buzzing, but I'd love to bring more of that shit here. That's how I see

1479
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:40,880
our future. Sat next to the opposite Stephen Bartlett yesterday and said,

1480
02:15:40,880 --> 02:15:44,720
if I could gift the UK anything, it would be enthusiasm. Yeah. You know, there's just so

1481
02:15:44,720 --> 02:15:49,680
much enthusiasm in America. And there's fucking, there's also stuff that they're super shit at.

1482
02:15:49,680 --> 02:15:54,480
That's trade-off. Yeah. That's trade-off. I wish I could take some of Britain to America as well.

1483
02:15:54,480 --> 02:16:00,480
I went to LA, man. I spent three days in LA, sort of in the kind of like entertainment world,

1484
02:16:00,480 --> 02:16:08,000
you know, doing Bill Maher and stuff around that. That is a different fucking world, my friend.

1485
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:18,160
How so? Oh, it's, I'm not a religious person, not yet anyway. But when I was there, I was like,

1486
02:16:18,160 --> 02:16:26,160
I can see why people need religion. This place needs God. It fucking does. I'm serious, man.

1487
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:33,600
The way people think about other people, if all you have is your success, if your value derives

1488
02:16:33,600 --> 02:16:39,760
from your status and success, whoa, that gets dark quickly. Whoa, that gets dark quickly.

1489
02:16:39,760 --> 02:16:44,800
Finding disposable objects everywhere. Oh, man, it's fucking, the way people see each other,

1490
02:16:44,800 --> 02:16:49,120
there's no humanity there. It's just like you're an object for what I'm trying to get to.

1491
02:16:50,080 --> 02:16:56,640
And that was eye-opening to me. Hollywood makes sense to me now. The movies they put

1492
02:16:56,640 --> 02:17:02,080
out make sense to me now that I've been there. A lot of it makes sense in a way that I'd never

1493
02:17:02,080 --> 02:17:08,080
realized. See, I never realized how powerful Hollywood is at shaping our idea of what reality

1494
02:17:08,080 --> 02:17:14,560
is because the movies, like, we in Britain, we think we understand America, right? Because we

1495
02:17:14,560 --> 02:17:20,320
watch their content. That's why. But that's not the reality of America at all. And the more you

1496
02:17:20,320 --> 02:17:25,600
travel around America, the more you are confronted by that fact. You know, the more time I spend in

1497
02:17:25,600 --> 02:17:34,560
the US, it makes me more right-wing in the American conception of, like, states' rights.

1498
02:17:34,560 --> 02:17:43,840
Because I'm going, I had a flight from Salt Lake City to LA. And you get on the plane in Salt Lake

1499
02:17:43,840 --> 02:17:49,120
City and you arrive in LA, which is not that far. And you go, these are different fucking,

1500
02:17:49,120 --> 02:17:54,640
these aren't just different countries. These are different worlds, different religion, different

1501
02:17:54,640 --> 02:17:59,600
people, different way of thinking, different philosophy, different culture, different everything.

1502
02:18:00,400 --> 02:18:06,320
And the values are completely different. You know, America's an incredible place.

1503
02:18:07,600 --> 02:18:13,440
I'm really enthused by it. And there's also trade-offs to some of the way that people are

1504
02:18:13,440 --> 02:18:18,080
there as well. So it's actually, you know, we talked about masculinity and femininity. And I think

1505
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:24,960
I actually know what people mean when they talk about toxic masculinity and toxic femininity,

1506
02:18:24,960 --> 02:18:30,480
which is you need both. You want to be thinking about it as raising both bars at the same time.

1507
02:18:30,480 --> 02:18:36,080
If you want to be a good leader, for example, right, you need to be strong and you need to be

1508
02:18:36,080 --> 02:18:40,080
able to say the thing that people don't want to hear and make yourself say the thing that you

1509
02:18:40,080 --> 02:18:43,920
don't want to say because you don't want to upset people. And on that hand, you also need empathy

1510
02:18:43,920 --> 02:18:48,320
and compassion too. Like you want to be raising both up. And I see that in the same way as culturally.

1511
02:18:48,320 --> 02:18:52,320
I want to take the best of the US stuff and the best of the British stuff and meld it together

1512
02:18:52,320 --> 02:18:54,560
into something really exciting.

1513
02:18:54,560 --> 02:18:57,440
Truck, yeah. Constantine Kiss and ladies and gentlemen, where should people go? They want

1514
02:18:57,440 --> 02:19:01,440
to keep up to date with your stuff. The best place to find my work is Trigonometry, of course,

1515
02:19:01,440 --> 02:19:06,480
on YouTube and the podcast. And I write on Substack, which has got really blown up at the moment.

1516
02:19:06,480 --> 02:19:10,320
I'm excited about that as well. And Twitter at Constantine Kiss and everywhere.

1517
02:19:10,320 --> 02:19:12,720
Hell yeah. Constantine, I appreciate you. I appreciate you, my brother.

1518
02:19:13,360 --> 02:19:17,520
Thank you very much for tuning in. If you enjoyed that episode with Constantine,

1519
02:19:17,520 --> 02:19:23,120
then press here for the full-length three-hour conversation I had with Eric Weinstein.
