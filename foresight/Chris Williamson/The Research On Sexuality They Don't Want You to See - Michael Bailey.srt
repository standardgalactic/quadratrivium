1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440
What happened with your recent article?

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:07,680
So the short answer is that our recent article has been

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,840
retracted by the publisher of the journal

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,120
Archives of Sexual Behavior where it was published

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:24,040
Retraction is something I've never had an article retracted before and it's something that I've associated with

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,200
terrible

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,200
things like

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,200
fraud

9
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,200
plagiarism

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,840
Grievous mistakes

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,400
None of that is true about our article

12
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,960
Frankly and honestly our article was

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:52,000
retracted because of the ideas and the evidence it presented that angered

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,400
Transgender activists and their allies who pressured the publisher who

15
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,200
Either agreed with them

16
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,640
based on politics or

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,120
Chickened out or were worried about business concerns. I can't read their mind obviously

18
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,760
But I will say that the retraction was a sham

19
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,280
I would also say that

20
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,280
The retraction has

21
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,320
Backfired entirely from their perspective

22
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,080
Our article has gotten far more attention than it ever would have

23
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,360
the publisher springer nature group

24
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,280
Keeps metrics on this

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,600
Our article has been downloaded almost 100,000 times, which is

26
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,160
You know, that's not perhaps a big deal for

27
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,800
Mainstream media, but for an academic article that is extreme

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,280
We have received more news coverage

29
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,040
we're about

30
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,720
40

31
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:09,480
Ranked 40 out of 400,000 articles of about the same age in terms of media coverage

32
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,680
Here we are talking, you know, I'm on a big podcast with you

33
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:23,840
And there have been articles and so on so I'm not hurting. I just want people to

34
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,520
download and read our article and

35
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:37,340
Don't pay attention to the retraction notice it it's meaningless if people want to get ahold of the now

36
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,400
Forbidden article, where are that? Where should they go? Same place? They ever did

37
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,920
Our article was published open access. That means we actually had

38
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,000
funding from

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,140
Society for evidence evidence-based gender medicine

40
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,360
Segem to

41
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,480
Published the article for

42
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,560
Free reading, you know most articles academic articles have a paywall that non academics

43
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,760
Can't get through easily. There's no paywall

44
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,400
The retraction simply means

45
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:22,320
For practical purposes that Springer stamped the words

46
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,660
retracted article on every single page of

47
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,840
the article

48
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,720
Which you could it doesn't affect your ability to read it and frankly I

49
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,240
Wear those words as a badge of honor now

50
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,920
That makes it kind of sexy it makes it it feels like it's a top-secret seal

51
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,360
So what's there's someone that's listening that wants to go and search?

52
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,920
What's what should they search for on the internet in order to get this article up in the right form?

53
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,840
So

54
00:03:54,200 --> 00:04:00,920
What I search in order to go to the site to keep track on our current metrics

55
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:06,980
You know, I'm really waiting for when we get a hundred thousand dollar view. I'm sorry one hundred thousand views

56
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,980
Diaz DIA Z

57
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,820
Bailey B. A. I. L. E. Y.

58
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:21,100
Our O. G. D. for rapid onset gender dysphoria, which is what it's about and then you'll have

59
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:27,380
Links to choose from choose the one that says Springer and that'll take you right to the site

60
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:32,200
You can read the article right there. Okay, so we've flirted with it so far

61
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:39,040
What was in your forbidden study, which was so reprehensible that caused it to be

62
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,160
retracted and

63
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,160
stamped with a wax seal I

64
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,960
I'll

65
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,320
Tell you in a moment, but I just want to give a bit of background

66
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,520
this article was

67
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,480
published by me and

68
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,640
a co-author

69
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,680
Susanna Diaz that is not her real name. I don't know her real name

70
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,040
She is the mother of

71
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:14,720
A gender dysphoric child whom she believes has rapid onset gender dysphoria

72
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:21,880
Which is rapid onset gender dysphoria something we need to talk about I assume that your audience

73
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:27,440
Doesn't necessarily know what it is. It's very important and it is the reason

74
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,440
Why

75
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,560
The trans activists came after us

76
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,400
Rapid onset gender dysphoria is

77
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,160
the explanation of

78
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,440
the surge in

79
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:49,400
Cases of gender dysphoria that has happened over the past decade and especially the past five years

80
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,920
The idea is this a

81
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,480
subset of

82
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:02,520
Gender dysphoric cases and now it's by far the greatest percentage are

83
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,760
Adolescent girls

84
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:14,600
Who never showed any signs of gender dysphoria in childhood? They were not tomboy's they were not

85
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,600
masculine

86
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,560
They did however have issues a

87
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,240
lot of them had some

88
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,520
Mental health problems. They had some social problems and so on

89
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,240
In adolescence

90
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,400
They tended to hang out with a crowd that

91
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,480
was unconventional and progressive and ideological and

92
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,160
they

93
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,160
got the idea

94
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,640
Based on

95
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:54,120
Theology that all of their problems are due to underlying transgender that they never knew of before

96
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,480
They suddenly or rapidly

97
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:05,440
announced or they decided that they're transgender and they announced to their parents and

98
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:13,120
Many of these girls. It's mainly girls about three quarters. There may be some boys, too

99
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,480
But we should talk about them separately a

100
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:21,320
Lot of them are demanding very serious

101
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,920
Treatments including medical treatments

102
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,080
They want

103
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,960
testosterone

104
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,400
which

105
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,400
has very serious

106
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:41,960
Effects on the body and some of them want surgery like the amputation of their breasts

107
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,480
And some of them are getting this

108
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,560
Our evidence in our article is

109
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,240
Entirely consistent with that

110
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,600
We surveyed

111
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,880
1655

112
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,400
parents of

113
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,960
Youth whom the parents believed had this syndrome

114
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,040
Three-quarters were of the youth were girls

115
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,440
The parents said that indeed these

116
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,720
youth had

117
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,160
pre-existing

118
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:25,840
Mental health issues and that the mental health issues actually preceded any

119
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:31,200
indication of gender issues by four years. That's a long time

120
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,640
The

121
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:43,800
Youth who were most likely to socially transition now social transition means

122
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,160
Changing their pronouns changing their style of dress changing

123
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,280
What they call themselves boy or girl

124
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:58,280
The youth most likely to socially transition were the ones with the most problems

125
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,560
That was also true for medical transition which was

126
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,560
Thankfully rare only about seven percent

127
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:15,800
Had sought medical or had obtained medical treatment whereas about sixty percent had

128
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,200
Taken many steps to social transition parents said after they

129
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,360
Socially transitioned they got worse

130
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,280
and

131
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,280
The best is what does worse mean?

132
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,160
they

133
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,800
Became less happy they became less

134
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,160
Close to their parents

135
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,640
They decompensated and

136
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,760
the best predictor of

137
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,400
Transition was

138
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,440
That the family had received a referral to a gender specialist and

139
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:05,800
And if parents visited a gender specialist they usually felt that the gender specialist pressured them to transition their child

140
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,240
So there were some other interesting findings too, but those were the ones that got

141
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,640
People upset and I think those are probably the most

142
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:23,160
Important findings because they are consistent with the idea of rapid onset gender dysphoria

143
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:30,140
Rapid onset gender dysphoria was first proposed by Lisa Littman who published the first paper in 2018

144
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,520
She also received

145
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,840
tremendous pushback

146
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:40,160
Her the journal where she published her article did not retract it, but they did

147
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:47,280
make her make changes to her original article and she suffered personal

148
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,240
Consequences Brown University where she was

149
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,080
Cut off their ties with her

150
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,840
She you know she lost

151
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,520
contracts with Brown University

152
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:12,000
Activists cannot stand the idea of rapid onset gender dysphoria and I understand why

153
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:18,280
Because it is threatening to their belief system

154
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,480
They're strong. They strongly believe that

155
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,160
Gender dysphoria is always real and

156
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,600
that the best

157
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,960
Way to proceed is

158
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:36,560
To transition as quickly as possible and furthermore that youth are

159
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,440
Always right when they say

160
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,800
That they are gender dysphoric

161
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:49,480
That they're trans just believe them all of these are contradicted by the idea of

162
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,440
rapid onset gender dysphoria and

163
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Our study was strongly

164
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,240
consistent

165
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,240
with

166
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,360
The existence of rapid onset gender dysphoria I

167
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,040
will admit

168
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,680
That ours is only the second

169
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:17,120
Major study of this phenomenon and there's plenty of work to do and I don't think that we've got this

170
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,640
Nailed shut so that everybody is

171
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,000
Obligated to see this world as we do

172
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,800
but it's an important study and

173
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,840
Instead of trying to silence our search it would been better

174
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,720
if

175
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,160
The skeptical had done their own studies

176
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:43,400
To try to clarify what they thought was going on but of course

177
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,040
They didn't want to do that

178
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:53,760
See if I'm right with my conception of this sort of two current

179
00:12:54,280 --> 00:13:00,600
Explanations for what's going on with regards to the increase that we've seen over the last ten years or so

180
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,400
one theory posits that

181
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,640
The world's

182
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,800
Degree of acceptance of trans people at large has changed

183
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,800
It's called the left-handedness argument online sometimes

184
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:20,800
Which is that during the Middle Ages if you were left-handed you were often accused of being a witch or a wizard or something

185
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:26,200
And it would cause you to be ostracized or sometimes killed or punished socially in some form or another

186
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:31,800
Which meant that I think maybe only three percent of people were left-handed during the Middle Ages

187
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,120
But then when left-handedness is no longer seen as wicked and it's socially accepted

188
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:42,320
I think the true number of left-handed people is closer to maybe 12% let's say so you see an increase in the number of people who

189
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,720
Identify as left-handed I suppose they can be their true

190
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,800
So they're true left-handed selves because there is no longer social stigma attached to it. There is a camp that

191
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
argues that the

192
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:03,040
Rapid increase that we have seen in the number of people identifying as transgender over the last decades to two decades or so

193
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,160
Has been due to this

194
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,520
Releasing of the glass ceiling and and judgment by the group at large

195
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,520
The alternative theory which is being put forward is one of social contagion

196
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,160
That explains why

197
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:22,240
Females in particular the F to M transition are particularly susceptible to this

198
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,960
females are more

199
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:32,840
Socially aware socially malleable and influenced. It's part of their sort of intersexual competition and status

200
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,360
measuring

201
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,360
Apparatus that they have a greater

202
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,160
susceptibility to trends around them because they are

203
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,800
It's important for them to remain part of the tribe in that regard

204
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:51,240
Which would explain or be part of the explanation for why girls seem to be more impacted by this

205
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,360
Ever-increasing number. It's almost like a mimetic sort of feedback loop that's occurring

206
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:02,000
How far away am I and what have I missed in terms of that conception of the landscape?

207
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,240
You put it beautifully better than I did

208
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,240
So you should have got me on the paper. I could have been cancelled as well. Yes. Yes

209
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,400
You're considered yourself a co-author on future research

210
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:20,000
Well, I actually I can take it. I get enough stick on the internet as it is already. Okay, so

211
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,240
What is

212
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,320
First question is it

213
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:34,760
Impossible for these two worlds to exist together. Is there a blending of rapid-onset gender dysphoria with the

214
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:40,880
Activists theory about about this. Is there a way that those two worlds could coexist? It's certainly and

215
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:47,560
I suspect they do it's it's a question of which is predominating

216
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,240
Obviously we become

217
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:57,280
Much more tolerant of the transgender fairly recently I

218
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,600
Wrote a book in 2003 and people back then thought that

219
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:08,840
Transsexuals were really weird interesting but weird and people were uncomfortable around them

220
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,280
now I think if anything they're thought to be

221
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,520
cool

222
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,520
and

223
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,560
I'm glad that

224
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,280
Tolerance has increased for the transgender

225
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,320
But I also think that it's important to realize

226
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,680
That

227
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,680
There may be trade-offs I

228
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:42,920
Don't think we need to be intolerant, but I do think that we need to be aware that

229
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,200
Attitudes affect what people choose to do

230
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,520
Being transgender is

231
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,400
Partly a decision that a person makes

232
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:02,400
Take a very for example a very masculine female

233
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:08,160
Well, she might decide well, you know, I'm not just a masculine

234
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,520
Teenage girl. I like playing baseball. You know, I'll just be a girl

235
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,760
But or she may say well gosh, you know, I

236
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,080
Could imagine being a boy plus

237
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:31,280
You know, I get a lot of cred if I am transsexual and

238
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:42,000
Also really something we haven't mentioned yet which is happening which I think is negative is the binding up of

239
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,240
transgender identity and victim status and

240
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,320
I just think that

241
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,280
That's a problem with our

242
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:58,640
World right now that we're promoting victim status not just among the transgender

243
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,880
But all kinds of phenomena and I just think it's very negative

244
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:10,640
It creates a perverse incentive for people to pedestalize things which are actually negative in the long term

245
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:18,320
Yes, self-harm, you know, if self-harm gives you a degree of prestige somehow in whatever

246
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,680
upside down vastal world it is

247
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:26,040
There is now an incentive for people to do a thing which there should be a disincentive for them to do

248
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:33,920
So you there is social renown now for self-harm or for

249
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,280
MP a

250
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,720
Multiple personality disorder. I don't know whether you saw on tiktok last year. There was a trend of people

251
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,800
They would have that others. I can't remember what the word was

252
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:49,720
It's like that other the other versions of them would would come out and I'm a this person and I'm at that person

253
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,200
Which again, you know

254
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:57,880
I'm pretty sure who was the guy that created eugenics who was the dude that did it in the 1900s

255
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,080
Francis Galton Francis Galton

256
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:05,160
Managed to make himself go insane by worshiping a doll as a deity

257
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,640
right

258
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:13,880
My point being that you can you can induce all manner of crazy psychological maladies if you believe them hard enough

259
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,520
that so I don't want to

260
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:22,800
Way in on Galton because I don't know what you're just talking about and I do know a fair about

261
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,880
Fair amount about Galton

262
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:32,200
But what the other thing that you said the key thing is absolutely true and really important and really fascinating that

263
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,560
If people believe

264
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,320
They can

265
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,720
Enact all kinds of things and when I say enact I don't mean they're pretending exactly

266
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,400
They're acting as if

267
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,360
They're acting in accordance with their beliefs

268
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,320
This is not the first go-around were for multiple personality disorder

269
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,320
We had an epidemic in the

270
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,360
early 1990s that was associated with an

271
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,400
Epidemic of recovered memories of sexual abuse. This was

272
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:13,000
young women typically who went to therapy with a therapist who believed in this

273
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,800
who persuaded these

274
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,240
Women that their fathers typically

275
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:27,920
Had sexual severely sexually abused them repeatedly over years despite these women never having any

276
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,560
Memory of this and of course these memories

277
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,960
These recovered memories were false

278
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,440
They didn't happen

279
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,440
and a subset of these women

280
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,600
also came to believe that they were more personality disorder and

281
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:50,720
I think that this what's happening now with ROGD rapid onset gender dysphoria is

282
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:59,320
The same thing and the women that the the big difference is that the girls this is happening to

283
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:06,520
Are getting it younger 14 15 16 instead of 24 25 26 and

284
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:12,000
They're getting it from their peers rather than a therapist. Otherwise I suspect

285
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,120
the same

286
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,960
kinds of people are involved at both

287
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,460
epidemics both times why

288
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,240
Why would it be the case that there are

289
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,120
Psychological risk factors like

290
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,360
OCD

291
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,640
autism spectrum disorder and a few others. Why would they be predictive of

292
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,640
ROGD?

293
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,600
Autism gets thrown around a lot as very common. I

294
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,280
Am not as impressed as many people are by the evidence for autism

295
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,440
for one

296
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,880
Diagnosis of autism

297
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:05,120
Has become so vague. I don't even know what it means anymore. It's become quite over diagnosed

298
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:13,120
The youth in our study did have an excess of

299
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,960
Formal diagnoses, but they were very general anxiety and depression

300
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,200
Why would

301
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,960
Women with these emotional problems have this susceptibility

302
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,520
I'm not sure the

303
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,680
1990s epidemic these were

304
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,560
somewhat older

305
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,400
individuals and so they had

306
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,400
More time to get accurate

307
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:46,320
Diagnoses and the number one associated diagnosis was borderline

308
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:53,680
Personality disorder which is associated with identity disturbance not knowing exactly who you are

309
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,240
What you want to be being manipulative being?

310
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,720
Prone to extreme emotions

311
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:08,760
Now do I have an explanation why it's they who

312
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:17,520
Are most susceptible to these false ideas. I don't think I do I don't think I do I

313
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:25,720
Had a conversation with David Geary a couple of months ago and David what do you fascinating guy?

314
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:31,360
Absolutely fascinating phenomenal episode and one of the things that I learned when speaking to him

315
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,640
He was the first person that introduced me to the concept of rapid onset gender dysphoria

316
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,400
the group

317
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,960
that

318
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,040
the

319
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:47,120
Another ideology that would be associated with some of the people who seem to be suffering rapid on debt gender

320
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:52,320
Rapid onset gender dysphoria would be a denial of biological differences between men and women

321
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:59,360
The fascinating thing that's oddly sort of recursive and cyclical and almost ironic if it wasn't so

322
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,160
odd is that

323
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:08,240
The very reason that we have a sexed difference in the number of F to M transitions is

324
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,760
precisely because of

325
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:16,400
The biological difference between men and women it is the biological difference between men and women that

326
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,920
predisposes these very goals to the

327
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:24,640
Increased susceptibility of transition and that's the same group that is denying it

328
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:30,240
So it's both the supply and the demand and the denial that kind of all rolled up into one. Do you know what I mean?

329
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,600
yeah, they have a very

330
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,280
strange set of beliefs that are mutually contradictory for example, they they believe in the

331
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,480
idea of

332
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:48,240
innate gender identity that may be hidden and so on but if it's an innate gender identity then and

333
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,960
That men usually have one and women usually have another

334
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,120
That's got to be a biological difference

335
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,960
Yeah, I I

336
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,280
Think that their science is

337
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,680
Not very

338
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:11,960
Coherent scientific. I don't think that's gonna be a very

339
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,920
Useful way to persuade them

340
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,600
What are the

341
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:24,280
Given you've had this relative landmark study, you know one of only two massive n-size of whatever it was

342
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,520
1655 pears

343
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:36,160
1655 parents okay reporting on each parent reporting on a child of theirs. Yeah, yeah

344
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,680
Um

345
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:43,180
What do you what are the implications of this moving forward? What have you thought about sort of next steps and such?

346
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:49,640
Well, I don't know my next step. I'm a you know, I'm an academic. I'm a researcher. I'm not a

347
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,560
clinician I

348
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,720
Think that we need to get

349
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,120
better and more detailed

350
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,720
Evidence and I'm involved in

351
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,720
What I think is going to be a really important

352
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,760
Study that is about to launch this summer it's in collaboration with Lisa Lippman

353
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:20,680
Who is the person who first studied rabbit on set gender dysphoria and Ken Zucker who is one of the world's leading?

354
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,160
experts in gender dysphoria

355
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,120
All three of us have

356
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,560
Been canceled at least once

357
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,760
Uh, so we're uh the

358
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,600
Collaborate cancelled collaborate

359
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:43,960
Collaboration, but uh, we also are experts who are unafraid to stay in here

360
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:48,360
We're in this study. We're going to be recruiting both

361
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:54,360
Gender dysphoric adolescents directly and their families

362
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:00,600
And we have a very extensive survey about you know mental health and

363
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,000
gender feelings about gender history of gender

364
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,440
Steps taken toward transition and so on

365
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:15,960
We hope to enroll thousands and we're going to follow these people up over five years at least

366
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:20,200
To see how they turn out and to see how that affects happiness

367
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:27,720
Are the ones who transition going to eventually be happier than the ones who didn't

368
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,760
For example, that's that's a big question

369
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,320
Fascinating. Yeah, fascinating. I suppose it's one of those things were

370
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,920
Being able to

371
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:43,000
Spin explanations without the scientific backing can be done at lightning speed

372
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:47,480
But being able to test the hypotheses with science is actually a pretty arduous task

373
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:54,040
So you are always going to be playing catch up behind whatever the wake is that's left in terms of people's bro signs

374
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,560
That's exactly right

375
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:02,200
We sometimes have been frustrated ourselves. The scientific process

376
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,840
Is slow in part for bureaucratic reasons

377
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,400
We have to be very careful

378
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,040
To get ethics approval for this which by the way was the reason

379
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:19,880
The ostensible reason not the true reason the ostensible reason why

380
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,960
My latest article was retracted. What's the story there? What what what was the reason that they gave you?

381
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,480
The reason was this

382
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,240
Susanna Diaz is not an academic

383
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,600
She just went ahead and put up a survey

384
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,320
She's allowed to do that

385
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,800
She's allowed to publish such a survey

386
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,920
I am an academic

387
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,040
I have constraints

388
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,920
Any research that I do I have to get approved

389
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:57,080
By something called an institutional review board IRB

390
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,120
for ethics

391
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,120
Now the data were already collected

392
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:09,640
It's too late to go through IRB I checked with my IRB and they said well

393
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,240
She didn't have to

394
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,280
and

395
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,280
You seem to be okay

396
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,520
Being a co-author on this

397
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:24,360
But Susanna have not done this very legalistic thing

398
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,320
That was a conventional

399
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,000
Informed consent which is basically

400
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,880
This is exactly what you're going to be doing

401
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,440
Do you consent?

402
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,840
That is

403
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,640
What springer

404
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:49,080
Said was lacking. That's why they retracted the article. Here's why that's ridiculous

405
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:56,440
She made it very clear to parents what the survey was about

406
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,800
They agreed by actually completing the survey

407
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,520
The last line of the survey said

408
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,360
We're going to publish this online when we get enough data

409
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,920
And that's something that springer also said she said you didn't tell them

410
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,480
That their data were going to be published. Well, of course, they want this published

411
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,120
they believe these parents

412
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,360
are sick

413
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,360
Of rogd being

414
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,360
Shoved to the side being silenced

415
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:34,680
That's part of the reason why they wanted to participate in the first place

416
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,560
So

417
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,560
That that's the reason they gave

418
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,280
I don't believe it for a second

419
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:48,840
But you know in our new research that we will be launching soon. We went through all the IRB

420
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,440
Procedure we are so covered

421
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:58,280
That uh, there's not going to be any chance of any problem like that

422
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:05,000
Moving on to some of the other work that you've done. What is the typical sexual orientation of

423
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,000
F to m and m to f people who identify as trans?

424
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,880
Well, I want to start with

425
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,360
What was typical

426
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,520
20 years ago and

427
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,520
And

428
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,520
Before which which was

429
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,960
Pretty well established

430
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:37,960
Back then most f2m's that is natal females who wanted to become

431
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,320
men first of all they were

432
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,280
Adults before they were able to achieve that there was no

433
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:52,120
transitioning of children or even adolescents

434
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,720
Almost all of the female the males were female attracted

435
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,360
Or in the vernacular of

436
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:07,320
Sexology homosexual female the male transsexuals

437
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,280
Uh, though about 10 percent

438
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,320
Were, um, attracted to

439
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,080
Men

440
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,440
For male the female

441
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,320
These are natal female. I'm sorry natal males

442
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,040
Who want to become women?

443
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,200
There were two types

444
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
The first type was

445
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:37,480
The type perhaps we are most familiar with the kind that comes to mind immediately it would be a

446
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,960
A male who was feminine from early childhood

447
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,600
Little boy who wanted to be a girl

448
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,080
Who became an adolescent who was

449
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:53,800
Basically a girl and then uh when he could get surgery he did in adulthood

450
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,440
That type uh was male attracted

451
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,080
and

452
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:05,240
Sexology called that a homosexual male the female transsexual

453
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:15,800
Jazz ginnings, I don't know if you know who jazz ginnings is she's a reality tv show

454
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,760
I

455
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,880
Have considered her that type though. I'm less sure now for

456
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
uh various reasons, but

457
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,160
the other type

458
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,360
is

459
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:32,360
At least as common, but it is quite unfamiliar because

460
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,240
Nobody talks about it and it is autogynophilic

461
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,880
male to female transsexualism

462
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,920
Autogynophilia is a sexual

463
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,520
Orientation I guess

464
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,000
whereby

465
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,640
A man is sexually aroused by the idea of being a woman

466
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,960
Most of these

467
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:06,440
Natal males are attracted to other people in the world and they're attracted to women

468
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,120
But they are also

469
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:17,560
Attracted to and sometimes much more attracted to a woman that they create inside themselves

470
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,640
It starts

471
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,040
typically in adolescence where they

472
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:30,440
Will put on their mothers panties and bra look at themselves in the mirror and masturbate

473
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,040
fetishistic cross-dressing

474
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:39,000
Many of them will have fantasies about having breasts and a vulva

475
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:44,920
And some of them will actually do what they need to to get those

476
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,920
Autogynophilia is very controversial because

477
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,920
Trans activists have tried to

478
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,880
Sweep it under the rug

479
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:04,920
They're embarrassed by it. I'm not I don't judge these people

480
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,920
Also

481
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,680
Many autogynophilic

482
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,160
transgender

483
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,160
persons

484
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,320
It experience

485
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,800
The theory as a narcissistic injury

486
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,000
Because it really means a lot to them

487
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,600
To think of themselves as like women

488
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,560
The theory says they're not like women

489
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:36,760
They're men with this weird sexuality

490
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,360
And so that hurts their feelings

491
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:46,120
So I published a book in 2003 called the man who would be queen

492
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,680
and

493
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,280
only

494
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,960
about

495
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,960
A third of the book

496
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,960
was about

497
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,800
adult transsexualism

498
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,800
including autogynophilia

499
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,360
And the trans activists back then

500
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:07,560
A few of them got so mad at what I wrote that they tried to ruin my life

501
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,200
Briefly, I thought they might

502
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,840
But you know, they did back then what

503
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,360
Is happening to our paper now they they caused a Streisand effect

504
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,400
so

505
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:32,200
More and more people have heard of autogynophilia including

506
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:46,680
Persons with autogynophilia and I want to stress that many of the many autogynophilic males are great people

507
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,440
In my experience if they are open and honest

508
00:36:53,160 --> 00:37:01,080
They're admirable. I have many autogynophilic followers on twitter

509
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,880
I have some autogynophilic friends and so on

510
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,880
And these people are angry

511
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:18,920
Have the activists who have tried to censor any discussion of autogynophilia

512
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
It has

513
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,200
Prevented us from knowing

514
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:32,360
Things like the best way that autogynophilic individuals should live their lives

515
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:36,280
Should they transition should they not transition?

516
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,680
We don't know the study studies haven't been done because

517
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,160
People haven't even felt free to ask the questions

518
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,120
Is there a

519
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:54,280
natal female equivalent? Have you ever come across anyone?

520
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,120
That is the opposite of autogynophilia

521
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
This is controversial

522
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:10,120
That should be that should be the preface for every single sentence that you say this is controversial

523
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:15,400
I would say scientifically. I don't think anybody is politically upset about this at least yet

524
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:21,320
Give it time. So the word for that would be autogynophilia

525
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,040
and

526
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,040
I know

527
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,360
Trends gender

528
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:38,520
Persons who insist that there really is autogynophilia

529
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:43,720
There's a guy who named phil illy

530
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,440
i l

531
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,640
phil

532
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,680
illy il y I think he's about to

533
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,320
publish a book

534
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,600
called

535
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,600
auto heterosexuality

536
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,080
very smart guy

537
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,520
But he believes that autogynophilia

538
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:08,760
Occurs commonly among transgender females

539
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,600
I am less convinced. You know, I'm I'm being a hard-ass

540
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,560
scientist, you know, I

541
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,520
May be but I

542
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:22,600
I kind of doubt it because male and female sexuality are so different

543
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:28,040
Autogynophilia is something that requires a male type

544
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,000
Sexuality which is very focused and fixed

545
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,960
and strong

546
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,960
and autogynophilia

547
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,200
occurs

548
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,200
kind of

549
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:46,120
genetically a male finds out on his own and becomes

550
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,840
Even though he's never heard of it before

551
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,120
It dominates his early sex life

552
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
and I'm really

553
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
kind of skeptical that that happens

554
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,640
In natal females, but we'll see

555
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,160
we'll see does that

556
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,480
if someone and if it's common

557
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,880
That somebody that's never heard of it before kind of stumbles upon this thing

558
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,360
this particular

559
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,360
interest this orientation

560
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:15,400
Does that suggest that there is a biological

561
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,280
disposition precursor?

562
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,280
I would bet

563
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,160
More money than I have that we will

564
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:34,360
Find that eventually. I think autogynophilia is strongly biological. Now. Can I prove that? No

565
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,800
but

566
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,960
What is going to make

567
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,160
A 14 year old boy

568
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:47,800
Decide to put on his mother's panties and go into the bathroom and look at himself and

569
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,360
Become aroused and so on

570
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,920
Nobody teaches him that

571
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:57,160
You know, there's a lot of I should hope not. Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of interest now

572
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,960
especially among

573
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,040
gender critical types about

574
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,400
something called sissy hypnoporn, which is

575
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:10,360
It's a type of pornography consumed by

576
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,440
Autogynophilic males and they're saying that

577
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:20,360
This porn is creating autogynophilia. Well, I don't believe it. I feel like

578
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,680
these guys

579
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:29,080
Have this interest and they're finding the porn. I I don't think anything plausibly is going to

580
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,800
To

581
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:36,280
Raise this idea in somebody that doesn't already have the interest

582
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:42,360
The other word that I learned when looking at some of your work is

583
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,320
morphophilia

584
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:49,480
One of the longest words I think I've ever said in my life. What's gynandromorphophilia?

585
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:56,440
Gynandromorphophilia, so I'm gonna say a word that I I think is fine, but

586
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,440
Um

587
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,760
Some people are touchy about it

588
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:05,160
Gynandromorphophilia is a sexual attraction to she males

589
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,120
What I mean by a she male

590
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,360
is a natal male

591
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:17,400
Trans woman who has both breast and a penis still

592
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,160
Um

593
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:26,040
You know, I I can see it. I can see I can I can see it in my mind's eye. Yep. Well

594
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,320
It's not hard to find it

595
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:33,480
online that that is a kind of pornography. I have come across

596
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,840
And it actually is

597
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,320
quite a common form

598
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,720
of pornography

599
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,880
and even I think just

600
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,920
Plano normal straight men

601
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,880
Get into that sometimes

602
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:53,080
But they're they're different than the kind of men

603
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:57,560
Who need that and prefer it and for example, I had a

604
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:05,480
I had a girlfriend at one time whose ex-husband

605
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:14,200
Had that preference and in order for them to have sex

606
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:22,600
They needed to bring a picture of a she male on the computer screen so he could look at it

607
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,560
and become aroused

608
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,560
That became a problem for her

609
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:33,640
I can imagine I can imagine that that would create complications. Yes. Yeah, but that's you know, I some other

610
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,520
Just plain old. I think

611
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,080
mostly just plain old straight men

612
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:41,720
They just I think don't have the hang up

613
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,520
about the penis being there too

614
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:52,440
This is what you know back in the 90s, you know on allen partridge, which is a famous british comedy show

615
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:59,080
One of his friends it turns out was going to thailand and he comes back and all he wants to hear about is the ladyboys

616
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:04,760
He all he wants to hear about is ladyboys. Tell me about the ladyboys. He keeps on saying. Yeah

617
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:13,160
That's right. The ladyboys. That's that's what they are. Yeah, they still tour as ladyboys of Bangkok in the uk

618
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:18,360
I don't know if that's the same in the u.s. But I mean there's posters everywhere for ladyboys of Bangkok

619
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,720
to my knowledge they don't come here, but um

620
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,240
You know, there are

621
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:29,880
She mail escorts that you can find online

622
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,680
I I knew

623
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,120
In writing my book

624
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:44,760
The 2003 book called the man who would be queen. I actually at that time knew some transsexual

625
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,400
Prostitutes

626
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,360
Some of whom had worked

627
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,400
as she mail prostitutes and then they

628
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:59,080
Uh got surgery and continue to work

629
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,160
as

630
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,160
female prostitutes

631
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,440
um

632
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:09,560
Opening opening up to as many markets as possible. Yeah. Yeah. Well the one that I'm thinking of

633
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,680
preferred the

634
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:16,600
The men who liked women to the men who liked she mails

635
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:21,720
I think she thought that the ones who liked she mails

636
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,600
Uh

637
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:31,720
I don't know that they treated her differently as as a very interesting. So this is this is an obvious

638
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,160
uh

639
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,160
follow-up which is

640
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:40,120
Is this a new category of sexual orientation? Are these people closer to gay?

641
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,680
People or are they closer to straight people?

642
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:48,440
Great question and so I can answer the second part of that question

643
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:52,920
They are very close to straight people. They're not at all gay

644
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,800
guys guys who get into she mails

645
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,680
So if we bring these guys in the lab

646
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:07,000
And we show them pornography featuring just women and the the kind that we use in this situation is two women

647
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,880
having sex with each other

648
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,040
female female porn and

649
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,600
male male male porn

650
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:17,320
uh, those are

651
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,320
the kind best kind of

652
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:23,720
Stimually because if somebody gets aroused there's no

653
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,560
Ambiguity about who they're getting aroused by

654
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:29,880
um

655
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:33,800
Guys who are into she mails get aroused to the females but not the males

656
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,000
But they get slightly more aroused to

657
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,480
videos

658
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,480
Of two she mails getting it on

659
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:47,720
And that's a little different than typical straight men who get more aroused

660
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,280
by two females

661
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,040
than two she mails

662
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:52,920
but

663
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,920
neither

664
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,920
Guy Nant Guy Nant or morphophiles

665
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,760
nor

666
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:01,240
regular straight men get aroused

667
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:02,680
to

668
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:04,200
two men getting it on

669
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,240
right

670
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:10,680
Next next obvious follow-up question to that is I've heard you say that heterosexual women are

671
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:13,080
Genitally indifferent

672
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,720
What does that mean?

673
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,040
I would say

674
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:21,480
Not just genitally indifferent. They're I think that they're

675
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,400
Conscious feelings

676
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,800
Are indifferent in the laboratory

677
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,600
to erotica

678
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,920
so

679
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,760
If we bring

680
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:39,880
Women into the lab and we show them the same kinds of stimuli two men having sex

681
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,360
two women having sex

682
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,720
Straight women

683
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,120
Show an indifferent pattern

684
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:51,880
Of genital arousal. They get equally aroused to both by both

685
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,680
And they get and they say

686
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
They get equally aroused by both now

687
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:58,680
they don't

688
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,680
get that aroused

689
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,120
Psychologically

690
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:09,160
They don't straight women do not get as aroused to watching either kinds of

691
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,440
erotic stimuli that I just mentioned

692
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,080
as either straight men do

693
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,720
or gay men do

694
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:20,680
But it is interesting that they seem to show this

695
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,320
flat pattern

696
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,320
lesbians in contrast

697
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,280
do

698
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,240
show

699
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,840
both a

700
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:32,440
genital preference and a subjective preference

701
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,800
for female stimuli is there

702
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,840
a vestigial arousal among

703
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,480
lesbians for men

704
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,520
lesbians do

705
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,520
get more aroused by

706
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,920
male stimuli than they do

707
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,720
to nature scenes

708
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:59,960
But what about do they get more aroused to gay men than gay men do to lesbians?

709
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:05,560
These questions are hard to answer

710
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:10,040
These are the studies that we need Michael. These are the these are the hard

711
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:15,080
charging questions that we need. Well, they're hard to answer because the kinds of

712
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,560
apparatus that

713
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:25,480
You must use to measure genital arousal and men differs from that

714
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:30,440
That you must use to measure it in women and the best evidence that we have

715
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,720
we've taken it out of

716
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:37,240
the genitals into the brain. We've done

717
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,280
fmri scanning

718
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,440
of

719
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,440
people

720
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,440
looking at erotic stimuli

721
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:52,600
And it pretty much shows the same patterns as the genital stuff does

722
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,640
And your excellent question I

723
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,440
I

724
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:03,960
Think I'm gonna have to hold off answering because I don't remember

725
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:11,240
That's fine. So we kind of I remember I um, I had a conversation with

726
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:17,640
Christina Durante and she taught me about a study where they brought

727
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:23,960
Women into a lab and they sat them down opposite

728
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:32,360
Two different guys one guy was really nerdy and one guy was kind of a bad boy leather jacket and sort of like quaffed hair and stuff like that

729
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:33,880
and

730
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,080
they

731
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:37,080
analyzed the

732
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,800
verbal responses and the

733
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:44,120
Physical responses that women had to each of these different men

734
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:51,240
Now they had a oscar winning film writer some award-winning film writer write the script that the

735
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:57,640
Gentleman actor was using so it's like, you know, if you were going to cut it the cool guys like if you come with me

736
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:00,040
I'll show you the best night of your life and it's going to be really cool

737
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:05,320
But I don't really care so it kind of it doesn't really matter so much very very high status prestige prestige prestige

738
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:10,440
Uh, whereas on the other hand the other guy was something else. Now the interesting thing is it was the same guy

739
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:16,520
The same guy was playing both roles. They just styled him differently in his mannerisms had been adjusted

740
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,320
one of the most interesting takeaways was

741
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:24,360
There was a a number of uh, lesbian female attracted women

742
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:31,080
Who were in the study and when they looked at their behavior with the lower status man

743
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:37,000
It seemed relatively straightforward when they looked at their behavior with the highest status man

744
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:41,560
even though they had a self report of not being attracted to him and

745
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:47,720
Their verbal behavior wasn't particularly forthcoming. Their non-verbal behavior was much more flirtatious

746
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:54,600
So they were playing with the hair more. They were kind of leaning in they were pouting a little bit more and what that kind of

747
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:58,680
Suggested to me, which I think kind of leads into some of your work

748
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:01,320
is that

749
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:04,200
Even for women who are not attracted to men for a very long time

750
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:08,600
Men have been the gatekeepers to so much with regards to

751
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:12,760
survivability reproduction protection resources, etc

752
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,400
that it feels like even

753
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,360
Exclusively female attracted women

754
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,560
Just keep this

755
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:27,400
Skill set in the locker room somewhere where if they need to deploy it because the chieftains come over

756
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:32,600
And she's just finished up with her girlfriend that nobody knows about secretly in a in a cave somewhere

757
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:35,080
uh, that she can still kind of

758
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:38,200
Turn it on and I thought that that was really interesting

759
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:42,680
That is really interesting. I wasn't familiar with that

760
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,320
also, I think that

761
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:48,040
lesbians

762
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:51,800
Women who identify as lesbians are not as exclusively

763
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:58,840
Female attracted as gay men are male attracted even if they

764
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,200
might deny that

765
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:03,960
lesbians

766
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,960
Are more likely than gay men

767
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:07,720
to

768
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,720
Become non-lesbian

769
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:13,480
You know relapse to go back. Yeah, there's

770
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:21,320
A researcher named lisa diamond who has studied something she calls female fluidity which

771
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,760
Refers to women's

772
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,400
greater propensity

773
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,640
to

774
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:34,760
I don't know become romantically interested in somebody regardless of their

775
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,400
natal sex and

776
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:43,080
Not all women do this and there are some, you know, let's say gold star lesbians who

777
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:44,360
Uh

778
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,360
would never

779
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,360
go for a man, but

780
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:52,920
I think there are more lesbians who have the capacity

781
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,880
For sexual attraction to men

782
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:02,120
Okay, so in your opinion, then is males sexual men's sexual orientation is more fixed and

783
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,600
Is more malleable?

784
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:07,960
Absolutely, and that's that's part of the reason why men but not women

785
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:12,200
Not many women

786
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:15,000
Have parapherias, which are these weird

787
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:17,240
sexual interests

788
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,960
Autogonophilia is a parapheria, but some others

789
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
are for example

790
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:28,440
Pedophilia sexual attraction to children. What's the what's the amputee one? What's that one?

791
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:32,600
That is called acrotomophilia. Thank you. Yeah

792
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:34,760
Right

793
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,760
Yes, which we've been studying

794
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:42,200
That there's um and zoophilia attraction to animals

795
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:46,120
Uh lipophilia, which is

796
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:52,760
Attraction to morbidly obese people and the guys who are into them tend to be just normal weight guys

797
00:54:53,640 --> 00:55:01,720
Uh, and we just we have a paper that is about to be published. It's uh accepted and I'm working on the proof now, which I think is

798
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,640
He modestly says I think it's very interesting

799
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:10,760
But we studied we we studied guys into amputees

800
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:15,640
Guys into animals and guys into the really huge fat people

801
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:20,280
And for each of these three kinds of parapherias

802
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:23,160
A lot of these guys

803
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,320
also have the

804
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:32,520
Inversion they are sexually aroused by the idea of becoming

805
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,320
Yes

806
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:37,720
fat person and animal

807
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,760
uh, which you know

808
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:46,040
And and I think we have about 10

809
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:51,880
Guys into amputees who've actually managed somehow to get amputations

810
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:55,560
Wow, so I first learned this from dr. James Cantor

811
00:55:56,360 --> 00:56:02,920
and spoke to him about it and and he described it in this really lovely way, which was um a lot of the

812
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:09,080
Sexual let's just call a lot of the parapherias that people have and and the odd fetishes that people are turned on by

813
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:14,840
Is reflected both outwardly and inwardly. So there are people who are attracted to amputees

814
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:18,920
There are people who see themselves as amputees. They have their limbs

815
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:23,560
They have all of their limbs, but they feel like they should not they feel like they shouldn't have that

816
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,760
He also, uh, I don't know whether you believe that this is true

817
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:29,560
Said that there are people who are attracted to children

818
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:32,680
And there are people who see themselves as children

819
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:37,880
There are men often who want to be dressed up as babies. We did the first study of this

820
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,120
Kevin my

821
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:45,160
PhD student Kevin sue and I did a first study of auto pedophilia and

822
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:49,800
That's right. Uh, and the most ethical form of pedophilia

823
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,760
Yeah, and when a really interesting finding of that, um

824
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,240
study was that

825
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:01,400
Men some of these men are attracted to boys. Some are attracted to girls

826
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:05,480
Well, the the guys who are attracted to girls

827
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:11,480
Are sexually aroused by the idea of being a little girl

828
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:15,080
Not a little boy, which is interesting

829
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:20,280
So you have it that is a great way to

830
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:21,880
prove

831
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:25,320
That the relationship outwardly and inwardly is the same

832
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:32,840
Yeah, because otherwise you wouldn't have this relationship between the two. That's so interesting. Why is everyone not a sex researcher?

833
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:38,920
Why is everyone not doing para paraffilia sex research the same way? Yeah, so interesting

834
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,800
Oh, okay. So

835
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:49,640
In your opinion does bisexuality truly exist in men like how how accurate do you think the stereotype is that bisexual women

836
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:52,360
Are really straight and that bisexual men are really gay

837
00:57:55,560 --> 00:58:00,600
In I think it was 2005 we published a paper

838
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:03,720
Um

839
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:06,280
That failed to find evidence

840
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:10,280
That male bisexuality truly existed

841
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,120
where

842
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:15,880
By that, I mean that men in the laboratory would show

843
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:19,240
Arousal to both men and to women

844
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:25,000
Uh that did not did not make us popular. We were um

845
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:28,280
You know it got us into the news but not

846
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,360
liked

847
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:34,360
We have kept studying this by we I and my

848
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:39,080
Then graduate student now. He's a professor in england garyl freeger

849
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,760
And we've uh gotten

850
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:46,520
several hundred

851
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:49,160
Uh

852
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:53,160
Several hundred uh subjects in the lab

853
00:58:53,880 --> 00:59:00,440
And uh two years ago we published in proceedings of national academy of sciences

854
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,400
A paper in which we

855
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:10,200
Showed beyond the shadow of a doubt that male bisexuality truly exists

856
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:14,360
Um

857
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:17,880
There is a subset of bisexual men who

858
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:23,960
Clearly produce arousal to male stimuli and to female stimuli

859
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:31,960
Most of them are somewhat more aroused by one sex than by the other. They're not exactly

860
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:42,280
Into predominantly gay or a predominantly straight bisexual man. Yeah. Yeah, but they're they're a bit bisexual. Yes. So I now

861
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:46,520
Believe for sure in male bisexuality

862
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:49,480
At the same time

863
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:52,040
If you talk to gay men

864
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:57,640
Ask just ask them this question. Did you ever say you were bisexual?

865
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:00,440
About half of gay men will say yeah

866
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:03,400
Then you say well, were you really bisexual in the same? No

867
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,440
So it really does

868
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:09,400
happen that

869
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,480
Some men misrepresent

870
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:15,400
Being bisexual, but it also seems to happen that

871
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:22,600
Some men are bisexual as I would understand that understood, but it's a small cohort and also

872
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:26,920
You it's difficult to stress test whether this is the thin end of the wedge

873
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:29,640
en route to becoming a

874
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:36,040
Fully fledged member of the gay community or whether you're actually going to just stop at the letter b. Yeah, that's interesting

875
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,200
um

876
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:44,760
What what about environmental influences on sexual orientation? So we have at the moment

877
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,800
in korea

878
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:55,160
A very sort of sex negative culture, which you'll probably be familiar with where there is the four b's movement women who are recanting

879
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:59,960
I can't remember what the four different b's stand for it in korean, but it's it's men

880
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:05,640
and patriarchy and family and work or kids or something like that and it is

881
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:08,280
downstream of a whatever

882
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:13,320
less than one birth rate and it kind of just it's everything's korea is just a mess, but

883
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:17,320
That seems like whether it be

884
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:21,800
outright celibacy slash abstinence or

885
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,960
Turning to lesbianism. I don't know whether that's true

886
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:30,920
That is a sexual orientation response

887
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:38,200
To an ecological or environmental cue right something has happened that has changed maybe the sex ratio

888
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:39,880
maybe the

889
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:43,640
Mate value of the potential available partners that are around

890
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:48,600
Downstream from that we have declining birth rates across the west, too

891
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:54,520
We have an increase in cohort of high performing women and an increase in cohort of underperforming men

892
01:01:55,720 --> 01:02:01,080
Hypogamously that means that maybe women are going to be struggling to find men that are of the mate value that they would desire

893
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:04,760
Even though we're in a society which has been the most sort of sex positive

894
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:09,640
Ostensibly than it's ever been. I think that there is a bit of a sex recession going on. There's a great

895
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:13,240
Article in the Atlantic about this

896
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:15,560
So with all of this folded together

897
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:21,000
How how malleable is sexual orientation in response to the local environment?

898
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,440
And could you foresee a future given where we're at?

899
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:29,400
Sexually and with the mating crisis at the moment that this could continue in the future

900
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:36,840
This is another one of those times when it's important to distinguish

901
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:41,160
Male and female sexuality

902
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:46,280
And this is what i'm going to say is speculative because

903
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:53,000
This hasn't been established and there's a lot of disagreement, but my

904
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:56,200
gut sense is that

905
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:59,800
Men's sexuality is not going to be responsive

906
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:03,320
to

907
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,880
Cultural pressure much

908
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:08,840
I say much

909
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:13,640
Because there are parts of the world where men will have sex

910
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:16,600
with other men

911
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,720
Other males let's not call them men

912
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:21,880
Men

913
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:28,280
If the males are presenting as very feminine and perhaps

914
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:30,680
transgender

915
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:33,160
so for example in samoa, there's uh

916
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:35,880
natal males

917
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:36,760
who

918
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:40,040
are considered a third sex called the fa fa fina

919
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:43,880
And you got the lady boys and tylen and so on

920
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:47,800
It's pretty common for just plain old straight men

921
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:53,480
To have sex with these natal males now. I don't think that makes them gay

922
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:57,160
They're not having sex with men. They're

923
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:01,080
Seeing these people as female like

924
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,840
But

925
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:07,000
I don't think there's anything

926
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:12,920
Any kind of cultural change even if I could build society from the ground up

927
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:15,720
that would make

928
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:18,040
Straight men

929
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:21,160
Want to have sex with each other

930
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:23,960
uh

931
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:29,720
I think women are likely different and more responsive to cultural factors

932
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:34,680
Uh and perhaps also things like um

933
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:41,160
Bad experiences with men there's a uh, you know this belief

934
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:43,560
that

935
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:46,840
One route to lesbianism is being mistreated by men

936
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:51,400
We don't know that's true, but I find it plausible

937
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:55,240
But I don't think that uh women mistreating

938
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:58,360
Men is going to make them go gay

939
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:05,240
No, that's fascinating. One thing that I've been considering a lot as you've been talking about the

940
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:09,560
thin line between what being gay means

941
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:11,720
physically

942
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:13,720
And what it means

943
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:17,800
In terms of appearance

944
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:19,960
You know, there's an interesting question

945
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:21,880
is a

946
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:23,720
very voluptuous

947
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:26,040
big boob big lips long hair

948
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:28,600
um

949
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:30,040
Thailand

950
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:32,280
lady boy type presenting person

951
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,400
more female

952
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:36,440
than

953
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:38,440
a very shaven head

954
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:39,480
uh

955
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:41,480
sort of more androgynous body

956
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:42,520
type

957
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:43,960
but

958
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:45,800
vagina owning

959
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,240
woman

960
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:51,240
And there's a really interesting question going on here. You know that you highlighted there it is

961
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,880
In some or it's referred to as a third gender

962
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:59,800
You know, there's a lot of um accusations from the left of genital fetishism, which you might have heard of

963
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:06,620
Which is that you're actually being uh, you're addicted to the genitals as opposed to the presentation

964
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:08,360
but

965
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:10,360
There is an interesting question given that

966
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:15,480
Our sexuality is so

967
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:18,200
easily fooled. We are such

968
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,640
rampant sexual beings that a

969
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,440
six inch by four inch screen

970
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:30,760
That has a small depiction of sex happening on it is enough to fool our brain to think

971
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:35,880
There's some sex happening here. No, there isn't there was some sex happening there

972
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:40,120
A long time ago and now you can see around the side of it. You know that it's not here

973
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:45,480
You know that you're not getting any of this. It's and that that illusion is responsible for the internet

974
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:48,680
correct, correct. Yeah, so

975
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:55,960
My point being that you you already can see as soon as you accept the fact that porn is an effective stimuli

976
01:06:56,920 --> 01:07:02,680
You accept the fact that it is not exclusively about the action. It's about the presentation, right?

977
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:09,400
Is it just a difference of degree not a difference of kind all the way down to

978
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:12,920
the more

979
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:19,000
Female presenting regardless of whether it's a xx or xy chromosome person

980
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:24,680
It it really starts to blur the line between what is and is not classed as

981
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:29,160
Same sex or an opposite sex attracted sexual orientation

982
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:33,320
Yeah, I think that all we have

983
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:37,400
for the most part are our senses are

984
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:44,360
And you know men especially but humans in general are very visual species and

985
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:50,600
You're absolutely right that some trans women even those who still have a penis

986
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:54,120
Can look

987
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:56,200
Quite

988
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:58,200
They look like really attractive women

989
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:06,040
Although often you can kind of see the remnants of their maleness and their bone structure or something like that, but

990
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:10,680
Yeah, I and I think that

991
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:14,120
In those cases

992
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:16,040
men who

993
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:18,040
don't feel

994
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:20,200
Attracted to them or say they don't

995
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:24,520
That's more likely to be

996
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:32,680
Uh mental, um, you know some kind of a version an idea like that person is

997
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:38,440
A man not a woman. So despite the fact that they look like a really attracted

998
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:41,160
Woman, I can't go there

999
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:43,320
um

1000
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:47,720
Yeah, it's so fascinating because I've seen this, you know, I've seen this argument happen on on

1001
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:50,920
dating shows or on

1002
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:54,600
Right-wing commentary channels and stuff like that around

1003
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:58,200
No, because that would be gay. I'm like, is it

1004
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:04,280
Is it more gay to have sex with what looks like a nine out of ten woman

1005
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:08,920
body shape size voice presentation actions everything

1006
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:11,480
with a penis

1007
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:18,360
Then it is to have the exact opposite all of the presentation factors of a man could be on testosterone could be all of the rest of it

1008
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:25,720
But has a vagina that it and it's a really really fascinating question. You know, there's sort of

1009
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:33,080
It falls in line with a number of other arguments. There's sort of more biological essentialism side of things, especially the people that would say

1010
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:37,560
Um, unless you can change your chromosomes and even not then if you're a natal male

1011
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:41,240
I'm calling you a man if you're a natal female. I'm calling you a woman for the rest of time

1012
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:44,840
Um, so it's a a suite of beliefs

1013
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:50,280
I suppose all of which are into play with each other and would also cascade down from that, but um

1014
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Yeah, it's a it's a really really fascinating

1015
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:56,680
consideration around what it means and this is when you get into the

1016
01:09:57,560 --> 01:10:03,400
deeper and deeper into the layers of paraphernalia and and the nuances of sexual orientation it all kind of starts to

1017
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:06,440
break apart. It's like the quantum level of of

1018
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:09,400
sex research, I suppose

1019
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:15,320
Yes, yes, we we are going on the outskirts here

1020
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:21,960
Um, what about people's gay dars? Do you think that most of us have an accurate gay dars?

1021
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:26,600
Yeah, this is again something we've studied quite a bit

1022
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:31,880
And yeah, but people have a much better than chance

1023
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:35,800
Gaydar

1024
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:37,800
Now it's not perfect

1025
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:41,240
but they are much better at than chance

1026
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:42,840
at

1027
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:44,840
discerning whether a man

1028
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:48,040
Is gay or straight and they

1029
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:50,360
rely

1030
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:53,000
So gay men, you know just their

1031
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:56,600
outward appearance

1032
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:59,160
In the west currently is not necessarily

1033
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:01,400
very feminine

1034
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:04,120
Although I I think gay men might

1035
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:10,680
present themselves more attractively than straight men, but it's more things like movement

1036
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:13,480
you know

1037
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:20,920
And speech speech patterns are yeah, you found there's like a gay accent. There's a gay accent. Yes

1038
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:23,160
What is the gay accent?

1039
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:31,720
So we we know it when we hear it and and you know actors can often

1040
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:34,840
effect the gay accent even if they're straight

1041
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:40,200
There's interestingly there's a lesbian accent too

1042
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
I I think a gay accent

1043
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:45,640
may tend to be more expressive

1044
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:49,000
and gay men articulate more clearly

1045
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:56,520
than straight men and lesbians have the opposite they're less expressive and they don't articulate as clearly

1046
01:11:57,240 --> 01:12:03,400
Do you think is that in any way gay men modeling female speech patterns? Are there any

1047
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:08,440
Parallels there? Yeah, you you ask great questions and the you know

1048
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:13,320
So nobody knows and I I think there are two at least two

1049
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,920
good hypoxies there one is that

1050
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:22,040
Unconsciously growing up gay men

1051
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:24,520
And

1052
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,840
You know some of them they had

1053
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:31,480
somewhat feminine gender identity and they

1054
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:34,360
did model

1055
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:38,520
The other is that there's something about gay men's brain, which is

1056
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:42,360
somewhat feminized and produces this speech pattern

1057
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:44,840
Nobody know

1058
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:46,840
well when it comes to the

1059
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:52,280
Ability to present clearly my speech coach that I use for the podcast is gay

1060
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:56,360
Classically trained in theater classically trained in improv

1061
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:03,000
For not just an outrageous communicator and probably the best communicator

1062
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:06,840
That I've had on the show is Douglas Murray who is also

1063
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:11,640
Him and Miles my speech coach are like two peas in a pod that have never met

1064
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:15,080
But just phenomenal like

1065
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:19,320
Out of this world precision with his ability to

1066
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:24,440
Remain cool under pressure to be able to communicate in a very precise way

1067
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
to be able to use

1068
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:31,720
inflection and drama and whimsy and to then be able to pull it back without being

1069
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:34,360
Fragile just phenomenal and so yeah

1070
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:39,320
I I wonder Andrew Doyle as well satirist from the uk that runs the titanium agrath

1071
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:42,760
Twitter account. I wonder I wonder whether

1072
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:47,720
Being gay is a competitive advantage in the world of online commentary, perhaps

1073
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:53,720
But yeah, it's all of that stuff so interesting and you write as all that you kind of

1074
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:57,480
I I don't think I've been around sufficient

1075
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:01,720
Lesbians to be able to say that I would I could pick up on that

1076
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:04,920
The only real things that I ever notice

1077
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:10,040
With lesbians are sort of the it's the dress. I think that

1078
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:18,120
Lesbian lesbians seem to dress significantly more differently to normal women than gays do to normal men

1079
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:21,480
Yeah, the the plaid shirts the baggy jeans

1080
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:23,880
um

1081
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:25,880
Yeah gay gay men

1082
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:27,320
dress

1083
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:30,120
somewhat differently more stylishly at least

1084
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:34,120
It's just better usually. Yeah, that's right. That's right

1085
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:37,080
Yeah, very funny

1086
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:46,440
What was that paper that you did about male mate value being more malleable than female mate value?

1087
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,400
No, that's an old one

1088
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,800
um

1089
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:56,840
Yeah, the student who was the lead author on that was interested in the

1090
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:00,360
Explaining the sex difference in the

1091
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:03,160
In depression women are more likely to get

1092
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:05,720
depressed than

1093
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:08,520
Men are and she hypothesized that

1094
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:11,720
it could be because

1095
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:16,600
You know women's mate value is more tied to

1096
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:20,680
their looks which she said you can't

1097
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:27,000
Do that much about whereas men it's their accomplishments which you can and

1098
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:30,200
um, and she got some evidence for that

1099
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:32,280
I'm not sure that I

1100
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:35,560
That's you know an old paper and I'm not sure I believe

1101
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:38,360
the theory because you know

1102
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:42,040
If women if women really can't do that much

1103
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:52,200
About their looks what's the cosmetics industry doing? I mean, uh, and you know, it's it's not that easy for a man to

1104
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
go out and double his income

1105
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,840
so

1106
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:59,400
Anyway, but that that's what the paper was about

1107
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:02,780
Yeah, so I find I had a conversation

1108
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:06,360
with ed hagan as well recently

1109
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:12,200
And ed did a study where they controlled for upper body strength

1110
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:18,520
When looking at differences in depression and anxiety and when you control for upper body strength the differences between men and women

1111
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:22,120
Get smaller and smaller and smaller and then essentially go away

1112
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:25,880
um, and the the the reason that I was interested in

1113
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:33,560
Discussing a malleability of mate value is that it's it's a common discussion that's had on the internet and it's born out of

1114
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:36,840
A contest between men and women about who's got it worse

1115
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:39,720
It's like well, it's easy for you

1116
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:41,800
because you just need to go and

1117
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:45,640
Get a boob job, but I can't make myself any tall taller and women would say well

1118
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:46,920
It's easy for you

1119
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:51,480
Because you know at 21 I reached my peak sexual market value and it's all downhill from there

1120
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:56,120
And you get to continue to accrue status and resources and it's very much sort of um

1121
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:00,120
two people talking different languages that

1122
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:03,480
the

1123
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:08,920
Sexual brains that the sexual attraction mechanism that works for men what they want from women and for women

1124
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:12,280
What they want from men are not the same. It's not you can't

1125
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:14,920
play

1126
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:18,760
A balancing act here. There is no ability to work out the equity

1127
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:23,480
There's no exchange rate between these two like how many boob jobs is three inches of height worth

1128
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:26,680
Do you know what I mean like there is no way of us doing it?

1129
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:32,680
Oh, well, you could wear high heels and put makeup on but you can go out for five years and increase your earning potential by

1130
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:36,760
40% like what what does that even mean when we're talking about this?

1131
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:39,080
um

1132
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:43,640
I had a theory which I think maybe total horse shit, so I'm going to try and bring it back up again

1133
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:46,200
I had a theory that

1134
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:48,200
um

1135
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:51,480
Male mate value to the individual

1136
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:57,560
To the individual is more malleable and to the group is less malleable and female

1137
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:03,000
Individual mate value is less less malleable and to the group. It's more malleable that

1138
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:09,480
You basically have as a man there are more degrees of freedom that you can move yourself on

1139
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:15,080
And there is a longer timeline that you can do it on specifically because of the fact that you know

1140
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:17,080
a guy who's

1141
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:18,680
35 is

1142
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:21,960
More attractive than a guy who's 25 to most women on average

1143
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:25,720
And I don't know when that peaks probably in your mid mid to late 30s, perhaps

1144
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:33,000
But even then, you know, Leonardo DiCaprio has been acquiring and disposing of under 25 year old girlfriends

1145
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:35,480
regularly for like two decades now

1146
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:39,880
So with sufficient status and resources you can continue to cycle through that

1147
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:41,640
um

1148
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:47,880
But yeah, what what do you what's your mindset at now when it comes to malleability, especially with us facing this mating crisis and

1149
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:50,120
and people having concerns around

1150
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:53,400
Being able to be seen by the other sex

1151
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:57,240
Well, I I think that

1152
01:18:57,640 --> 01:19:01,320
In the sense that I understand you I think we're probably very malleable

1153
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:05,640
The culture has changed tremendously

1154
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:10,760
You know in a fairly short time and it's kind of

1155
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:13,160
guessing it will

1156
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:20,280
Change tremendously still I hope it changes back in certain ways because I'm not that happy with certain things now

1157
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:25,640
But that's a different question than do I know how to change it and I do not

1158
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:29,160
And that that

1159
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:31,320
has to do with

1160
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:33,320
male female interactions

1161
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:38,360
As much as academic freedom both of which well the latter concerns me more now

1162
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:45,160
Michael Bailey ladies and gentlemen Michael, I really really appreciate your work any opportunity to dig into

1163
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:52,920
People that are looking into sex is is fascinating for me. I've immensely enjoyed talking to you. I I hope that we get

1164
01:19:55,640 --> 01:20:00,360
More chances either in person or back here whatever I have

1165
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:07,960
I have a laundry list of things that we didn't get to talk about to do with sexual arousal patterns virtuous pedophiles

1166
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:09,800
the

1167
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:15,320
Birth order effect of homosexuality so we can absolutely run this back. Let me know once your new paper is out

1168
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:22,360
As a reminder for the people who want to check out your article and also follow you online and stuff like that

1169
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:25,080

I am

1171
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:30,280
boring academic
