0	2000	Korea had no future.
2000	4000	At their current fertility rate right now,
4000	8000	for every 100 Koreans, there will be 5.9 great grandchildren.
8000	12000	We are looking at a 94% population collapse over the next century.
14000	17000	Why have you been in the news so much recently?
18000	23000	Because I am calling out that the emperor has no clothes right now,
23000	28000	and I think a lot of people have mentioned collapsing fertility rates before,
28000	34000	but I think that no one has really so consistently
34000	40000	brought it up in a way that the people who want to ignore it
40000	42000	have to look at the problem.
42000	44000	When I point it out, because I think a lot of people,
44000	46000	especially on the more progressive side of the spectrum,
46000	48000	they just want to dismiss it.
48000	50000	Oh, the planet's better without humans or whatever.
50000	55000	But when you point out that not a single society on Earth today,
55000	58000	except for maybe Israel, we can talk about that later in the conversation,
58000	63000	has figured out how to have prosperity, gender equality,
63000	67000	and high levels of education, and anywhere close to a stable population,
67000	71000	considering we are trying our best, and I think rightfully so,
71000	73000	to spread those things across the world,
73000	75000	that should be like a note.
75000	79000	That should be like, oh, this system that we think is so great
79000	83000	and we want to be the future of human civilization doesn't seem to work
83000	86000	at the most basic level.
86000	90000	That seems like quite a scary proselytization for the future,
90000	92000	or prediction for the future.
92000	97000	If you're to say that we need to get rid of one from education, equality,
97000	101000	prosperity, or birth rate,
101000	104000	we just need to concede the fact that birth rate.
104000	108000	What we need to do is we need to find new cultural solutions.
108000	112000	We need to find a way to maintain fertility rates
112000	116000	while having education, while having gender equality,
116000	119000	and while having a high level of prosperity.
119000	122000	There are many places we can look in the world today
122000	125000	to begin to get inspiration for how we might do that.
125000	128000	I think to understand the scale of the threat right now,
128000	132000	one of the things I always start people with is when I started caring about this.
132000	135000	A lot of people are like, why is it that people in Silicon Valley
135000	137000	seem to care about this so much?
137000	139000	It's because there's a lot of VCs in Silicon Valley,
139000	143000	VCs need to chart the economy 50-100 years in the future
143000	145000	in the way that Wall Street people really don't.
145000	148000	They're looking at the economy 5-10 years out or whatever.
148000	150000	Because of that, when I was working as a VC,
150000	153000	I happened to be working in Korea when I was working in a VC,
153000	156000	and I kept trying to chart the future of the economy,
156000	158000	and I kept coming to the same answer.
158000	161000	Is it Korea had no future?
161000	163000	At their current fertility rate right now,
163000	167000	for every 100 Koreans, there will be 5.9 great-grandchildren.
167000	171000	We are looking at a 94% population collapse over the next century.
171000	174000	When I brought this up with the other partners at my firm,
174000	177000	and I was like, hey, it just doesn't seem like
177000	180000	there is any feasible economic future for this country.
180000	183000	They're like, yeah, but we pretend that's not the case in our investments.
183000	186000	Everybody knows this, but if we accepted it,
186000	190000	then the economy stops working, society stops working.
190000	192000	We're just going to ignore it basically.
192000	196000	When I came back to the US, it was like going back in time 20 years.
196000	198000	I was in some sort of a sci-fi movie,
198000	202000	and getting to be this one person who saw where the future was going to go,
202000	205000	and having to be that crazy person on the streets.
205000	207000	No, no, no, you guys don't understand.
207000	210000	There's countries further ahead than us on this spectrum right now,
210000	213000	and we know a few things. We know there is no floor.
213000	216000	No country has hit a fertility collapse floor yet.
216000	220000	We know that there is no level of advanced fertility collapse where people freak out,
220000	223000	or at least not until it's too late, because you look at Korea right now,
223000	227000	60% of Korean citizens are over the age of 40.
227000	232000	It's likely already too late for them to turn this problem around.
232000	235000	We need to turn this around before we hit that level,
235000	237000	but the truth is we probably won't,
237000	241000	and we've got to think of solutions for when we don't turn this around,
241000	243000	but that's a different topic for later in the interview.
243000	246000	One of the most common questions I imagine that people ask is,
246000	251000	why should anyone care about how many children another person has?
251000	253000	This is my choice.
253000	257000	You can't impose me to have kids if I don't want to have them.
257000	261000	Why should two guys sat on the Internet be telling the world
261000	263000	about the dangers of not having children?
263000	266000	People can go and do other things with their lives now.
266000	268000	Women are allowed to be in the workplace.
268000	271000	Men can go their own way and play video games
271000	274000	and be a Sigma male as much as they want.
274000	277000	Why should anyone care about how many children another person has?
277000	280000	So I think that that's a really good point.
280000	283000	In our foundation, I think one of the things that people most often get wrong about us
283000	286000	is that we are trying to increase the world's population
286000	292000	or that we are trying to proselytize broadly to increase fertility rates.
292000	294000	And neither one of those things is true.
294000	296000	If we are on the Titanic right now,
296000	298000	no matter what the Titanic hits the iceberg,
298000	303000	we are trying to, one, make people aware that the Titanic is about to hit an iceberg,
303000	308000	get them in lines by the rafts, the ones who want to survive,
308000	313000	start getting the rafts in the water in a common orderly fashion before people start panicking
313000	315000	because that's what's going to happen.
315000	319000	And so what we promote is trying to get,
319000	321000	I mean, I know my family is going to be okay.
321000	324000	You know, I know that my cultural group is going to be okay.
324000	327000	Broadly speaking, so one, I know that my family,
327000	329000	you know, I have eight kids and they have eight kids
329000	330000	and you do that for 11 generations.
330000	333000	That's more descendants than exists in the world today, I often say.
333000	335000	So I don't need to worry about people like me.
335000	340000	The reason I'm so loud about this is because I'm worried about the massive collapse
340000	345000	in cultural and ethnic diversity the world is about to see.
345000	349000	And it will be astonishing for people.
349000	354000	I think in the far future, there were more than like three ethnic groups
354000	357000	and three cultural groups or something like that if we don't solve this.
357000	359000	And so what we're trying to do is just make people aware of this
359000	363000	because so much of the propaganda that people are consuming is telling them,
363000	368000	things are fine, have less kids, you're a good person if you have less kids.
368000	372000	And I know you've talked about this before on the show and it is, it is astonishing.
372000	379000	And I think when we look at this urban monoculture that is erasing all of the genuine diversity in our society,
379000	382000	one of its core messages is negative utilitarianism.
382000	387000	That the core evil thing in the world is human suffering
387000	389000	and that human happiness just doesn't really matter
389000	391000	or it is largely outweighed by human suffering.
391000	394000	And therefore it's better if humans don't exist.
394000	396000	And that's the end goal for the urban monoculture.
396000	398000	I think for a lot of people.
398000	400000	What do you mean when you say urban monoculture?
400000	405000	Well, okay, so this sort of gets down to like my personal politics to some extent.
405000	408000	But I think that if you look at society right now,
408000	411000	it's largely becoming divided into two factions
411000	416000	and there has been a major political shift around what conservative and progressive means.
417000	420000	The progressive is a party of this urban monoculture,
420000	426000	which is a single sort of cultural group or virus that infects other cultural institutions
426000	431000	and erases whatever makes them unique and aligns all of their goals.
431000	436000	So if I talk with a progressive Muslim or a progressive Jew or a progressive Catholic
436000	440000	or a progressive Unitarian Universalist and I scratch beneath the surface,
440000	443000	often their morals, their views on gender,
443000	447000	their views on what future they want for the world are all very, very similar.
447000	450000	If I look at conservatives from each of those factions,
450000	452000	their worldviews are very different.
452000	455000	And what the conservative party seems optimizing around,
455000	457000	so where the liberal party is optimizing on the goals of this monoculture,
457000	461000	so spreading the monoculture and reducing in the moment human suffering,
461000	463000	that's why they promote things like haze,
463000	466000	you know, like don't tell somebody that it's unhealthy to be fat
466000	467000	because that could hurt their feelings in the moment,
467000	470000	even though like obviously it's bad for them in the long term.
470000	477000	But the conservative movements all have very distinct cultural histories
477000	479000	which they are trying to preserve.
479000	482000	And that is often, if I look at the conservative movement today,
482000	488000	it's an alliance of these older traditions and newer but deviant and distinct traditions
488000	494000	that are trying to maintain cultural fidelity and exist 100, 200 years from now.
494000	497000	And so when I talk about the monoculture, that's what I'm talking about.
497000	500000	This thing that wants to, when my kids go to school, say,
500000	503000	this is what correct morality is, this is the way you should see the world.
503000	506000	And if your parents are telling you anything else, they're deplorable and wrong.
506000	511000	Is that not the case with some factions from a conservative side as well, though?
511000	514000	Yeah, yeah, no, and I call them sleeper progressives.
514000	518000	They just want to erase all other cultures the moment they gave power.
518000	522000	But I think that right now I can form an alliance with them because our goals are aligned.
522000	525000	I think one of the really cool things that we've seen with the conservative party
525000	528000	is you saw something like when Andrew Tate converted to Islam.
528000	531000	In the past, a conservative icon converting to Islam,
531000	533000	a lot of people would have been wringing their hands about that,
533000	534000	but a lot of people were like, you go.
534000	537000	At least you found some faith, at least you found some tradition.
537000	541000	And so I think what we're seeing there is more of a realization
541000	547000	that the big bad these days is this culture that's trying to homogenize the world.
547000	548000	Interesting.
548000	551000	What would you say to the well-meaning people from the progressive movement
551000	556000	to say it feels a little bit bad to be tarnished with the brush as a super virus?
556000	559000	I think that I'm just somebody that holds liberal values.
559000	563000	I don't believe that I'm part of some destructive force within the world.
563000	568000	And I think that there are people who genuinely, like within any movement,
568000	572000	when the Catholic Church used to be the iteration of this in European society
572000	574000	and they were trying to convert everyone to their ways.
574000	578000	And the Protestant Church during their own time had a period like that in some countries.
579000	582000	The vast majority of Protestants, their Catholics in those countries,
582000	584000	were just decent, well-meaning people trying to live their lives.
584000	587000	But the ones who controlled the cultural institutions
587000	592000	and were burning people at the stake and trying to ensure that everybody fit
592000	596000	this very narrow definition of morality set by their culture,
596000	600000	to me they were the evil ones within those institutions.
600000	604000	And today, when I talk about this monoculture,
604000	607000	I think that the vast majority of people who are members of it
607000	611000	were the vast majority of Catholics and Protestants during periods
611000	615000	when those cultural groups were dominant in specific regions.
615000	618000	Why is this culture so effective?
618000	619000	Very interesting.
619000	623000	Okay, so it's evolved a lot of new tactics that had never been tried before.
623000	625000	So in our book, The Pragmatist Guide to Crafting Religion,
625000	628000	what we essentially do is we argue that humanity can be thought of
628000	633000	as sort of an evolving firmware, which is like our biology, our genes.
633000	636000	But on top of that firmware, there's evolving sets of software.
636000	639000	And this software, today we often talk about memes
639000	642000	as like things that infect somebody and then cause them to just turn around
642000	643000	and infect other people.
643000	647000	But historically, most romantic clusters actually augmented a person's
647000	651000	sort of biological fitness, the number of surviving offspring they had,
651000	652000	and that's how they survived.
652000	655000	That's how, I mean, if you look at things with a secular mindset,
655000	659000	why things like Islam and Judaism figured out stuff like handwashing
659000	663000	literally centuries before science figured out handwashing.
664000	666000	And you see this across these traditions.
666000	668000	For example, if you look at all of the old traditions,
668000	671000	almost all of them have some arbitrary self-denial holiday,
671000	675000	like Lent or Ramadan or Feast of the First Burner, whatever, right?
675000	679000	And just now, after throwing out all of those rituals over the past,
679000	682000	you know, 50, 100 years, secular society is like,
682000	684000	oh, now we got to have our juice cleanses.
684000	687000	Now we got to have our, you know, they're realizing of fasting
687000	688000	and stuff like that, right?
688000	690000	It has positive mental effects.
690000	693000	And so I think that if you see these as different,
693000	695000	like evolving cultural groups,
695000	700000	this super virus evolved some very unique tactics,
700000	703000	and it is not the same thing as a historic progressive movement.
703000	706000	What it is is something, so the reason I call it a super virus is
706000	709000	that it is very much so when you talk about a super bacteria
709000	712000	or a super bug, they typically come up in things like hospitals
712000	715000	where you have a ton of people with a weakened immune system
715000	719000	all in a similar environment with lots of sort of viruses or bacteria
719000	723000	that can intermingle alongside antibiotics and stuff like that.
723000	725000	This is what was created by the internet.
725000	729000	This is why all of this stuff started when social media happened.
729000	736000	Essentially, you had a super spreader environment where pneumatic ideas
736000	740000	were able to test themselves against all of the world's traditions
740000	743000	at the same time, optimize and react very quickly
743000	749000	and become incredibly virulent while evolving strategies
749000	751000	that had never been tried before.
751000	753000	So one of the most effective strategies that it uses
753000	755000	is if you look historically,
755000	758000	if you look at cultural groups as sort of like nodal clouds
758000	760000	that sort of overlap with each other,
760000	763000	when you had a corrupted node within a nodal cloud
763000	765000	or a node that looked like it was flipping,
765000	767000	what you would do if you were a majority Protestant country
767000	769000	or majority Catholic country and like a Catholic came in
769000	771000	and started preaching or a Protestant came in and started preaching,
771000	772000	you'd burn them.
772000	774000	You'd burn them at the stake often, right?
774000	778000	Or if somebody just had like random cultural mutation
778000	780000	in the same way you have like random genetic mutation
780000	782000	and they believe something weird like they were a witch
782000	783000	and you burn them, right?
783000	786000	That's how you maintain this level of cultural fidelity.
786000	789000	What the virus does, which is very interesting,
789000	795000	is it organically determines when a node looks like it might be flipping
795000	798000	and then it essentially shadow bands the node.
798000	802000	It begins to de-connect that node's links
802000	805000	to all of the rest of the network's power structures.
805000	808000	And this is really powerful because what it means
808000	811000	is the other nodes that might be allied with that node,
811000	814000	they don't react the way they would have historically
814000	816000	when somebody was being like burned at the stake or something like that,
816000	819000	which is actually why cancellation is a fairly ineffective tactic
819000	821000	and genuinely not use that much
821000	824000	when contrasted with just a shadow banding process
824000	826000	of the person just doesn't get a promotion
826000	828000	if it looks like they might be immune to these ideas.
828000	832000	They just don't, you know, their papers get published a little less.
832000	836000	You know, certain platforms begin to favor them less
836000	837000	because of the algorithm.
837000	842000	And that's how it has been able to maintain such control,
842000	845000	I think, of the upper echelons of our society.
845000	850000	But it's not like every organization is run by a progressive movement, right?
850000	854000	There are organizations out there that seem to be a lot more open to new ideas.
854000	857000	We're seeing pushback from a variety of places to the opportunity
857000	860000	for people to have independent jobs.
860000	863000	So I would say that it's not every organization.
863000	867000	So it specifically targets the organizations it can best use
867000	870000	to maintain its population levels.
870000	874000	And so those are typically organizations that are involved in education.
874000	876000	So you're looking at the middle school system,
876000	878000	the high school system and the college system
878000	881000	or the organization that it is most critical that it maintains
881000	883000	an absolute strangleholdover.
883000	885000	And this again comes to fertility issues.
885000	887000	Of the populations of the world,
887000	890000	if there is one population that has a very low birth rate,
890000	893000	it is this population, this urban monoculture.
893000	900000	And because of that, the only way it can repopulate its ideological faction
900000	905000	is through siphoning children from other often more conservative cultural traditions
905000	907000	or in other ways, deviant cultural traditions
907000	910000	that are for whatever reason, having a lot of kids.
910000	913000	Okay, getting back to fertility,
913000	918000	what groups are doing particularly well and particularly badly when it comes to fertility?
918000	920000	This is a fascinating question.
920000	925000	All right, so if you look in a post-prosperity environment,
925000	926000	so a lot of people, they're like,
926000	929000	oh, well, countries in Africa are doing really well.
929000	933000	They have high fertility rates or Muslim populations have high fertility rates.
933000	935000	And it's like, well, that's irrelevant of those populations
935000	938000	or in a country where the average salary is under $5,000 a year,
938000	940000	because that is where you get above replacement fertility
940000	944000	in pretty much every country that's under $5,000 a year, you get above replacement.
944000	948000	Every country above $5,000 a year, you typically get below replacement fertility.
948000	951000	And so it's a level of desperate poverty, first of all,
951000	952000	that is often misconstrued.
952000	955000	So you look at Latin America, Central America, South America, the Caribbean,
955000	960000	collectively as of 2019, so old news, they fell below repopulation rate.
960000	963000	So it's really just a few of these poorest countries.
963000	968000	So I really ignore any country at a high fertility if it's a poor country
968000	970000	or if it's not a wealthy country, right?
970000	974000	And so I think where you can see is some misunderstandings that people have from that.
974000	976000	So you look at populations like Muslim populations,
976000	979000	when they enter wealthier countries, their populations really crash
979000	981000	or when the countries where they are the dominant social group.
981000	982000	So you can look at Iran.
982000	985000	Iran's fertility rate fell above, below replacement a long time ago.
985000	989000	And since 2014, they've been trying pretty much everything in their power
989000	992000	to try to get fertility rates back above repopulation rate.
992000	996000	And their government has a lot of control over the populace and they are not able to.
996000	998000	They're still only at 1.7.
998000	1002000	So the groups that really show resistance to this are conservative Christian groups
1002000	1004000	and conservative Jewish groups.
1004000	1006000	And this is why I always think it's funny when people are like,
1006000	1009000	oh, you're talking about fertility rates, you must be about saving white people.
1009000	1013000	And it's like white conservative people are like the only people on earth
1013000	1019000	who don't seem to be disappearing in the face of prosperity induced fertility collapse.
1019000	1021000	The groups that are most at risk are the Eastern traditions.
1021000	1025000	Even conservative iterations of those traditions are very bad
1025000	1028000	at resisting prosperity induced fertility collapse.
1028000	1031000	Prosperity induced fertility collapse.
1031000	1035000	What is the relationship between prosperity and fertility?
1035000	1039000	Well, as I said, typically when a country earns over 5,000 USD a year,
1039000	1042000	fertility begins to fall below replacement rate.
1042000	1043000	Yes, why?
1043000	1047000	Oh, well, so this is what we can say is nobody quite knows,
1047000	1049000	but there is some evidence as to what might be causing this.
1049000	1054000	What is probably causing it is the ability to engage with a modern economy.
1054000	1058000	So when somebody is not engaged with the modern economy
1058000	1063000	and not valuable to the modern economy, then the modern economy basically ignores them
1063000	1066000	and they go on living the way humans have always lived and having a lot of kids.
1066000	1069000	This is why within developed countries.
1069000	1071000	So if you look at a country like the US, right,
1071000	1074000	typically the less money you make, the more kids you have,
1074000	1077000	except when you're at the very high end of the income spectrum.
1077000	1082000	So if you're making an average of half a million dollars a year or more as a family,
1082000	1084000	you will be at above replacement fertility.
1084000	1090000	And in many ways families at that income level are just not like the economy isn't grabbing them as much
1090000	1092000	because they don't need the economy as much.
1092000	1096000	So what's really happening is if you look at our sort of free market structure,
1096000	1102000	what it does is it organically determines how to reward anyone who has the probability
1102000	1108000	that it believes has the probability of being productive with just enough money
1108000	1113000	to get them to spend their time being productive versus doing anything else
1113000	1117000	that may have long-term benefits to the society like having kids or whatever, right?
1117000	1119000	And it's very, very good at doing this.
1119000	1125000	And then it draws them into environments like cities where it becomes even harder to have kids
1125000	1129000	and where they can, anyway, yeah, where they can be more productive
1129000	1133000	and spend more time working and generating money for this larger economic system.
1133000	1138000	I was going to say it doesn't seem like, it doesn't seem realistic
1138000	1142000	that this could be a large behemoth,
1142000	1146000	evil-y behind the scenes working to try and get fertility rates down.
1146000	1150000	It seems more likely that it is a natural byproduct of a capitalist machine
1150000	1153000	that wants to have workers who are available as much as possible
1153000	1155000	who don't take maternity or paternity leave,
1155000	1160000	who are buying their clothes and taking their holidays,
1160000	1164000	consuming and producing and pumping money back into the system.
1164000	1165000	Is that the way that you see it?
1165000	1167000	I absolutely agree with everything you're saying there.
1167000	1168000	And that's also what I mean when I talk about the virus.
1168000	1170000	I don't think any decision is made maliciously.
1170000	1172000	I think everybody thinks they're a good guy.
1172000	1174000	Everyone's trying to do what they think is best for the world.
1174000	1181000	But sometimes sort of cultural evolutionary pressures can create incentive systems
1181000	1186000	that lead to actions that in the long term will have consequences
1186000	1188000	that I think most people would think are bad.
1188000	1192000	Okay, at the beginning you mentioned a bunch of other contributing factors,
1192000	1194000	prosperity being one of them.
1194000	1196000	What were the other elements?
1196000	1199000	Gender equality and education are typically the other two.
1199000	1200000	Run us through those.
1200000	1206000	Well, gender equality, it is often specifically female education.
1207000	1214000	When women begin to have a choice as to what they do and can participate in the economy,
1214000	1218000	I don't think that it's that they're choosing not to have kids.
1218000	1222000	I think that that is a misunderstanding of what we're seeing in the data.
1222000	1225000	I think it's that they prioritize economic stability
1225000	1229000	and basically having their life in order before they decide to start having kids.
1229000	1232000	But the way our economic system is structured,
1232000	1235000	people often don't really feel they have their life in order
1235000	1240000	until they're mid-30s or 40s and at that time they can no longer have kids.
1240000	1244000	And so I think that that is why.
1244000	1246000	It is not that women are choosing jobs over kids,
1246000	1251000	it's that they're choosing jobs then kids and their biological clocks run out.
1251000	1256000	While at the same time, and I think this is something that's really undersold
1256000	1257000	when people talk about fertility collapse,
1257000	1260000	is the absolute collapse of marriage markets in our society.
1261000	1264000	I saw a tweet and I couldn't agree with it more.
1264000	1269000	Being in a happy marriage these days feels a bit like catching the last chopper at an arm
1269000	1274000	because it is hard out there to find a good partner.
1274000	1278000	And we have seen a collapse of the systems that previously
1278000	1283000	ensured people found great long-term dedicated partners.
1283000	1284000	Well, that's the point.
1284000	1286000	It's not just about declining birth rates.
1286000	1288000	It's also about declining dating.
1288000	1295000	So 50% of guys aged 18 to 30 say that they are not looking for casual or long-term relationships.
1295000	1300000	I mean, you know, that's an unbelievably shocking statistic to say that
1300000	1305000	your natural biological inclination as a guy during the period of your life
1305000	1308000	when you're going to have the highest testosterone you're going to have
1308000	1312000	is just checking out completely of either casual or long-term relationships.
1312000	1316000	The same thing goes for women broadly as well that it's just not good.
1316000	1322000	So how do you fold in this decline in dating as well as children?
1322000	1325000	I mean, how do you fold it in?
1325000	1328000	What I just say is it's a problem.
1328000	1331000	And one of the things we look at, I mean, we've written multiple books on like
1331000	1334000	The Pragmatist Guide to Relationships, The Pragmatist Guide to Sexuality,
1334000	1337000	looking at this problem, trying to come up with solutions to this problem.
1337000	1342000	And I think that this brings us to what the real solution to this problem is in a broader context.
1342000	1347000	Not just dating, not just, but also fertility collapse, also the cultural.
1347000	1350000	So whenever anybody first hears about fertility collapse,
1350000	1355000	they often want to use it as a way to justify I think the talking points
1355000	1359000	they wanted to push before it became a problem on their table.
1359000	1361000	Like as soon as they accept it's a problem, then they're like,
1361000	1363000	oh, I can use this to push things I wanted to push already.
1363000	1366000	So they'll say things like, oh, well, you should do cash handouts,
1366000	1368000	except we know that doesn't really work.
1368000	1370000	You know, Hungary spent 5% of its GDP last year doing it
1370000	1372000	and they got the fertility rate up by like 1.6%.
1372000	1375000	When it's dropping like 3% year every year in a lot of places in the world,
1375000	1376000	that's really irrelevant.
1376000	1379000	Like China, 2020, drop 20%.
1379000	1381000	2021, drop 13%.
1381000	1386000	In 2022, COVID lockdowns are over, it should be going up, only went up 0.18%.
1386000	1393000	You know, so you're just seeing a 1.6% increase for 5% of your GDP is irrelevant.
1393000	1397000	So, and people are often like, well, you could spend more.
1397000	1399000	What if you spent 50% of your GDP on this?
1399000	1404000	But if it's naturally dropping every year, then you can never catch that toad
1404000	1406000	if you're doing it by spending money.
1406000	1408000	And it's the same with things like free childcare.
1408000	1410000	God, I would like free childcare.
1410000	1412000	You know, I plan to have seven kids or something like that.
1412000	1416000	But in the countries that offer it, it does seem to help fertility a little bit,
1416000	1419000	like maybe like 3% or 4%, which is a pretty good amount.
1419000	1422000	But it's not enough to offset the trends that we see.
1422000	1424000	And then you talk to conservative groups and they're like,
1424000	1428000	well, what we should do is, and I'm talking far conservative groups,
1428000	1431000	not ones like me, but they're like, we should create estates, basically.
1431000	1435000	You know, stop immigration, have one culture, one country.
1435000	1440000	Except if you actually look at the statistics, the countries in prosperous countries
1440000	1444000	with the lowest fertility rates are often estates, you know, like South Korea, stuff like that.
1444000	1447000	You look at the countries that have been most resistant to fertility collapse
1447000	1450000	in the prosperous world, you're looking at countries like Israel in the U.S.,
1450000	1453000	some of the most diverse countries.
1453000	1456000	And you can even see this with cultural groups across countries.
1456000	1460000	So you look at like Iran, remember I mentioned Iran famously has a real big fertility country
1460000	1463000	and they're basically a Shia monoculture.
1463000	1467000	But you look at Shia Muslims in India at similar economic levels where it's much more diverse
1467000	1470000	and their fertility rates like twice what it is in Iran.
1470000	1474000	So I think that that's the first thing.
1474000	1477000	So then the second question becomes, well, how do you actually solve this problem?
1477000	1481000	Right? You look around the world and we've already talked about it.
1481000	1483000	I mean, the solutions sort of staring us in the face,
1483000	1490000	the groups that are resistant to this are the ones that deviate in some way from the urban monoculture.
1490000	1496000	Most of them are traditionalist religious groups and there are some traditionalist religious groups
1496000	1499000	that are more resistant to this fertility collapse than others.
1499000	1504000	And some that seemed like they were resistant and then all of a sudden collapsed.
1504000	1505000	Mormons are an example of this.
1505000	1509000	Like Mormons had great fertility rates than like five or six years ago,
1509000	1512000	something happened and now they're probably below replacement rate.
1512000	1521000	And so what that tells me is that the solution to this is going to come at the level of cultural experimentation,
1521000	1526000	both fortifying our traditional cultures to be more resistant to the new threats they're facing,
1526000	1533000	but also potentially inventing new cultures that work with technology, the internet,
1533000	1537000	new strategies that are open to us, which is what my family is trying to do.
1537000	1539000	Tell me more about that.
1539000	1543000	Okay. Yeah. All right, so I can go deeper into this.
1543000	1546000	So we have everything from like our own traditions of the family,
1546000	1551000	our own sort of the moral framework, different ways of naming our kids,
1551000	1554000	different ways of dressing to an extent, like we look weird to other people.
1554000	1557000	And a lot of people are like you guys look like freaks.
1557000	1558000	Don't you know your kids will be weird?
1558000	1559000	Don't you know they'll be bullied?
1559000	1563000	And I go, you know, look around the world, which families,
1563000	1565000	which cultures are going to exist in the future?
1565000	1568000	It's one's like the Amish, the Hasidic.
1568000	1570000	You know, wherever you look, they look different.
1570000	1572000	They dress different.
1572000	1574000	They name their kids different things.
1574000	1577000	It's because when you call something cringe,
1577000	1579000	when you call something different or weird or freaky,
1579000	1585000	what you are saying is it differentiates from the cultural norms to which you are accustomed.
1585000	1588000	Those cultural norms became the dominant cultural norms
1588000	1593000	because they had a good immune system, because they were good at dehumanizing the other
1593000	1595000	and calling people freaky and stuff like that.
1595000	1598000	But the reality is that if you want to join this game,
1598000	1600000	and this is why I'm out here, this is why I'm yelling,
1600000	1603000	I don't want a future where it's just my kids is a failure, right?
1603000	1604000	Where it's just my family.
1604000	1606000	I want as much diversity into the future as possible.
1606000	1607000	That's why I'm shouting this.
1607000	1608000	I want people to join us.
1608000	1611000	I want them to experiment and fortify themselves
1611000	1616000	and not become overly complacent with their existing traditions
1616000	1621000	if their kids are being effectively peeled out by this monoculture.
1621000	1622000	It's very interesting to me.
1622000	1624000	You know, I sometimes hear people in the rain.
1624000	1627000	Why don't you just convert to like a traditional religious framework?
1627000	1632000	And it's because most of those frameworks are right now on the downtrend
1632000	1636000	in terms of their ability to continue a high fidelity and maintain their kids.
1636000	1641000	I do want them to find new systems to protect themselves against that.
1641000	1647000	But that's why that's just going to traditions isn't the answer anymore.
1647000	1653000	The virus or whatever you want to call it has gotten too good at finding kids.
1653000	1655000	And so we have to find new systems.
1655000	1660000	And also just the environment the kids are in with internet, with social media.
1660000	1661000	It's so different.
1661000	1663000	And then with AI that they're going to face.
1663000	1667000	How do you keep your kid from dating an AI girlfriend when they can have a deep fake
1667000	1670000	that's perfect and hot and loves them, right?
1670000	1673000	They need to want something other than hedonism.
1673000	1678000	And that's a difficult message to convey to kids if they adopt the dominant social mores today.
1678000	1686000	So to recap what you were talking about to do with this sort of almost monotheistic future
1686000	1692000	or this sort of monoculture future that we would end up with if birth rate decline continues.
1692000	1696000	For the people that might look at this and say, well, this is you trying to put forth
1696000	1698000	you want it to be a white ethno state.
1698000	1701000	You want it to be more of your progeny that are out there.
1701000	1706000	Your point is that that is the subgroup which is one of the few
1706000	1708000	which are continuing to be okay at the moment.
1708000	1714000	We're actually going to lose genetic and racial diversity if we allow the current trends to continue
1714000	1719000	because some of the groups that are reproducing with the lowest fertility rates
1719000	1721000	are the ones that add to that diversity.
1721000	1726000	So in the future what you end up with is a very small number of different cohorts
1726000	1730000	of stuff like Amish stuff like not even Mormons apparently anymore
1730000	1735000	who are then downstream going to be the ones that fill out the entire country.
1735000	1740000	Yeah, if we do nothing, the future is really just conservative Christians
1740000	1743000	and conservative Jews and maybe conservative Muslims.
1743000	1747000	Those seem to be the only groups that are just like persistently resistant to this.
1747000	1752000	So that's a pretty sort of bland future racially from...
1752000	1755000	Yeah, and there's some groups that in the very near future
1755000	1758000	like if I was looking at this like an ecologist, right,
1758000	1760000	like the groups I would be probably most concerned about right now
1760000	1762000	are groups like the Jans and the Parsi.
1762000	1764000	Like a lot of Americans don't think about,
1764000	1767000	but there's some of the oldest, most distinct cultures in the world right now
1767000	1771000	and they will almost certainly have collapsed in population by the end of the century
1771000	1774000	to the point where it'll be difficult for them to carry on their traditions.
1774000	1779000	Coming back to that conversation about we get prosperous,
1779000	1782000	we give women education, they enter the job market
1782000	1786000	and they have other things to do with their life.
1786000	1788000	What's your proposal?
1788000	1791000	Presumably you're not saying that we need to rip women out of the workplace or education
1791000	1795000	and if it is the case that we don't want people to be less prosperous
1795000	1799000	and we also want to let people choose what they want to do,
1799000	1803000	if this is what they want to do, if women don't want to have kids
1803000	1806000	or if they don't feel like they're ready and they don't want to have kids until they are,
1806000	1809000	they're concerned about the living cost and the cost of bringing a child into this world,
1809000	1812000	they're concerned about the environment, they're concerned about losing their life freedom
1812000	1815000	and struggling to find the right partner, whatever it is,
1815000	1818000	they've got better things to do with all of the money that they've just found.
1818000	1821000	Why shouldn't they be allowed to do that?
1821000	1825000	I think they should be allowed to do that and I think that real feminists today,
1825000	1828000	when I say a feminist, I mean somebody who wants gender,
1828000	1831000	well I don't know if feminism is the right word, people who want gender equality,
1831000	1834000	whatever word you want to use for wanting gender equality
1834000	1838000	in 100 years and 200 years to be an option, right?
1838000	1841000	You're sort of at the crux of history right now
1841000	1847000	because no group that really has gender equality except for maybe Israel,
1847000	1850000	we can get to that later, there's questions there, whatever,
1850000	1854000	but it's anywhere close to above repopulation rate.
1854000	1859000	So those groups and those cultural traditions are going to eventually disappear
1859000	1863000	and what they will do is they will get better in the short term
1863000	1866000	at taking the kids of people from these conservative traditions,
1866000	1870000	but eventually, I mean just the way cultural evolution works,
1870000	1873000	the conservative traditions will build systems that have resistance
1873000	1875000	to whatever technique that they're using
1875000	1880000	and they will not be able to repopulate that way anymore.
1880000	1885000	So if you actually care about this, then you can join the grand experiment
1885000	1888000	and the grand experiment is, and this is something we genuinely don't know yet,
1888000	1893000	is it possible to have gender equality and a high fertility rate?
1893000	1896000	My family, so like when I look at what my wife and I did,
1896000	1898000	I was asked to be on this podcast, Simone is in here,
1898000	1900000	not on my choice, I would have her on typically with me,
1900000	1903000	we write our books together, we run our companies together,
1903000	1906000	is one solution to the gender equality question,
1906000	1909000	which is to do everything together, write your books together,
1909000	1912000	run your companies together, raise your kids together, right?
1912000	1916000	But there are other solutions to this question that people can experiment with
1916000	1920000	and what I love is this isn't a question of what's the most moral way to do things.
1920000	1924000	Sort of the future will decide who was actually successful,
1924000	1928000	who was able to have a lot of kids, motivate the continuation of the tradition
1928000	1931000	through their children, you know, you get 18 years to pitch to your kids
1931000	1933000	that your way of living is a good way of living.
1933000	1935000	And if your kids don't like that or they don't agree with that,
1935000	1940000	I think we're blessed and that we live in a society where they can choose something else.
1940000	1944000	And so, you know, I think that we are going to have a,
1944000	1949000	hopefully a lot of people trying new ways of living,
1949000	1952000	new ways of trying to achieve gender equality, like my family,
1952000	1957000	you know, doing everything with your spouse isn't the way that gender equality is typically envisioned
1957000	1959000	when people talk about it, but it is a form of gender equality.
1959000	1962000	Can liberalism last under demographic decline?
1962000	1965000	Oh, no, no, it's gone. It's dead.
1965000	1967000	I mean, if you talk conservative liberalism, maybe,
1967000	1969000	like if you're talking about like traditional liberalism,
1969000	1971000	if you're talking about the progressive movement,
1971000	1975000	I often say it's a bit like if you get a certain blast of radiation, right,
1975000	1978000	your DNA can be scrambled, your cells can no longer replicate.
1978000	1980000	You don't know that you're a dead man walking yet,
1980000	1982000	you know, before you begin to feel the pain,
1982000	1984000	but there is nothing that can be done to save you at that point.
1984000	1987000	The fertility rate is so low as in that community,
1987000	1989000	there's really nothing that can be done.
1989000	1991000	Even if you look at the genetic level right now,
1991000	1993000	it's so funny, you know, conservatives are often like,
1993000	1998000	hey, you're on our team, why are you alerting them to the scope of the problem?
1998000	2001000	You know, we win if we just sit back and let them disappear,
2001000	2003000	and it's like they're going to disappear no matter what.
2003000	2007000	If you look at the hereditability of voting patterns,
2007000	2009000	which is around 30 to 50%, you know,
2009000	2012000	whether this is done with identical twin studies and stuff,
2012000	2014000	this is not like fringe science, you can look up Geno politics on Wikipedia,
2014000	2016000	it's like mainstream.
2016000	2021000	And you look at current fertility rates in countries like the U.S.,
2021000	2024000	we should expect about a one standard deviation shift
2024000	2026000	conservative in voting patterns over the next century.
2026000	2030000	In the next 10 or 20 years, we'll see a massive shift to the left
2030000	2034000	because as family units get atomized,
2034000	2036000	people vote more progressively.
2036000	2038000	When people don't have kids, they vote more progressively.
2038000	2042000	But after that, you're going to see a massive shift in the other direction,
2042000	2045000	and it's just inevitable from the statistics at this point.
2045000	2049000	Has any country tried to fix this problem through authoritarianism,
2049000	2051000	and how does that work?
2051000	2053000	A lot have, it just doesn't.
2053000	2057000	So Romania fit, what is it? Order 7707 or something?
2057000	2060000	I don't know, maybe I'm getting a confused with Star Wars orders.
2060000	2064000	But they decided under the communist period that they were going to ban abortion.
2064000	2067000	And they thought, oh, this will be great.
2067000	2071000	It'll shoot up fertility rates, and it did for a very brief period of time,
2071000	2073000	like two years or something like that.
2073000	2077000	Then people found ways around it, and then after the law was repealed,
2077000	2082000	fertility rates crashed because fertility or having kids became associated
2082000	2089000	with really poverty often or low social status.
2089000	2094000	And so you can look at countries like Iran that have been trying to implement things.
2094000	2096000	It's really funny, I watched what China is implementing right now,
2096000	2098000	and it's like, Iran tried all of this 10 years ago.
2098000	2101000	You guys can just look at what happened.
2101000	2104000	You're going to have to get really aggressive if you actually want to solve this,
2104000	2106000	and that's where I get really scared.
2106000	2109000	Because a lot of countries, what we have found is that you can,
2109000	2112000	dictatorially, people have tried to ban abortions,
2112000	2114000	feel like what's happening in China now,
2114000	2122000	likely shutting down access to vasectomy clinics and stuff like that.
2122000	2125000	So countries can ban these things,
2125000	2129000	and then it doesn't work because it doesn't work.
2129000	2130000	So then what did they do?
2130000	2132000	Then you get real handmaid's tale, and that gets scary for me.
2132000	2134000	It was actually the peace on us in the Guardian,
2134000	2137000	and they were like, they had quoted me saying something like that,
2137000	2139000	and they go, well, that sounds like a threat.
2139000	2142000	And I'm like, do you have the mind of a child?
2142000	2144000	It's like when I tell a child, don't touch the stove,
2144000	2145000	you're going to burn your hands.
2145000	2147000	They're like, that sounds like a threat.
2147000	2151000	I'm trying to protect you here, but there's nothing I can do.
2151000	2154000	At the end of the day, the Titanic's hitting the iceberg.
2154000	2159000	I'm just trying to prepare for what's going to happen next.
2159000	2162000	But what happened next get really interesting.
2162000	2163000	Sorry to keep talking.
2163000	2164000	I don't want to.
2164000	2165000	No, keep going.
2165000	2166000	OK, so it's really cool here.
2166000	2168000	If you look historically, so when I started caring about this,
2168000	2170000	I was in Korea, right?
2170000	2171000	95% population collapse.
2171000	2176000	It was funny to think about because the memory is so strong there.
2176000	2179000	Less than a century ago, Japan coming over,
2179000	2183000	murdering in Korea and China, millions of people,
2183000	2186000	this conflict there, China, Korea, Japan, trying to,
2186000	2188000	well, less Korea trying to take over the other two,
2188000	2191000	but mostly the other two trying to take over each other.
2191000	2193000	There's a lot of history there.
2193000	2196000	And it's so funny that now any one of them could just,
2196000	2197000	I'm like, how does Korea solve this?
2197000	2200000	I guess they could import people from Japan or China.
2200000	2202000	No, you can't because their populations are collapsing.
2202000	2207000	Any one of them could non-violently just walk into their neighbor
2207000	2208000	100 years from now.
2208000	2211000	They were able to motivate their citizens to kill people,
2211000	2213000	but they're not able to motivate them to have kids.
2213000	2215000	And this is what's so interesting.
2215000	2218000	It changes the game, but in a really beautiful way.
2218000	2222000	You look at people like Putin who don't get the new world yet, right?
2222000	2225000	The world used to be, you keep out immigrants,
2225000	2227000	you maintain cultural integrity,
2227000	2230000	and when you want to spread your culture, you go to other countries,
2230000	2231000	you kill their people, you subjugate them,
2231000	2233000	and you force them to convert to your culture.
2233000	2235000	But that's not the game anymore.
2235000	2237000	So you look at Russia, which has a desperately low fertility rate,
2237000	2241000	attacking their costless cultural and like ethnic neighbors,
2241000	2244000	the Ukraine, who also had the desperately low fertility rate,
2244000	2247000	both killing like an entire generation here.
2247000	2250000	And they're never going to recover from this.
2250000	2255000	It is not the game anymore, the game that they're still playing.
2255000	2259000	You win now, not through war, but with love.
2259000	2262000	And I say love and not just sex or spamming kids,
2262000	2263000	because if you spam kids,
2263000	2266000	they're going to breed like caged panda bears like everyone else.
2266000	2270000	They're going to not have any dedication to whatever weird thing about your culture
2270000	2272000	caused you to have a lot of kids,
2272000	2275000	and they're just going to drift off into this monoculture and disappear.
2275000	2277000	So what you need to do is you need to have a lot of kids,
2277000	2279000	but you also need to do a great job raising them,
2279000	2281000	make them proud of your cultural group,
2281000	2284000	make them want to continue that cultural group,
2284000	2287000	and those are the people who are going to be around in the future.
2287000	2289000	And I'm really excited about that,
2289000	2293000	because that is so much better than the old system of murdering people.
2294000	2298000	Can you try and explain or illustrate
2298000	2303000	what a world in deep population decline would be like?
2303000	2304000	Yeah.
2304000	2307000	So the first thing, and I often don't talk about, you know,
2307000	2310000	the first thing is all economies are going to collapse.
2310000	2312000	Pretty much the Western economy.
2312000	2315000	So our economic system is sort of a pyramid scheme.
2315000	2318000	A lot of people know this, but let's just spill it out.
2318000	2322000	If you look historically, people go, is this truism?
2322000	2326000	If I put money on this stock market, that money grows on average.
2326000	2329000	That has been happening because of two things.
2329000	2332000	The number of workers has been growing exponentially,
2332000	2336000	and the productivity per worker has been growing around linearly,
2336000	2338000	a little exponentially, but mostly linearly.
2338000	2340000	Yes, technology has been growing exponentially,
2340000	2342000	but the productivity per worker is about linear,
2342000	2345000	or at least not close to the explosion worker population.
2345000	2348000	That is why the economy has always been growing.
2348000	2351000	If the worker population in the developed world
2351000	2353000	begins to collapse exponentially, people are like,
2353000	2357000	well, why don't people in desperately poor countries count?
2357000	2359000	Because by definition, they have small economies.
2359000	2362000	That's why they're poor, because their economies are small.
2362000	2366000	So you don't need to wait for the world's population to begin to collapse
2366000	2369000	for all of the developed world's economies to begin to collapse.
2369000	2372000	So you're going to begin to see the economy shrink on average.
2372000	2375000	It won't be like it is now where on average things go up.
2375000	2376000	On average things go down.
2376000	2379000	When things go down on average, people react very differently.
2379000	2382000	You don't leave your money in the stock market anymore.
2382000	2386000	You're going to have math withdrawals of money from the stock market.
2386000	2388000	And then this begins to break a bunch of other systems.
2388000	2390000	So you see things like Detroit.
2390000	2394000	Okay, so why did Detroit ultimately end up having the problems it was having?
2394000	2396000	And there's a few reasons.
2396000	2401000	One is our society uses this miraculous cheat code called debt.
2401000	2403000	Now, I'm a private equity VC guy.
2403000	2404000	I'm very familiar with debt.
2404000	2406000	So let's just talk a little bit about how debt works
2406000	2408000	and why it's such a miracle.
2408000	2413000	If I'm making a $10 investment in $8 of that into debt and $2 of equity
2413000	2418000	and that investment grows to just $12, my equity in that investment has doubled.
2418000	2423000	But if it shrinks just $1, my equity has halved.
2423000	2427000	We leveraged our land, our businesses.
2427000	2432000	Leveraged means took out debt against our cities, our states, our nations.
2432000	2434000	It's not people looking like the national debt.
2434000	2435000	No, no, no, no.
2435000	2439000	It's leveraged to the hilt all the way down.
2439000	2445000	If things start shrinking, the whole thing falls apart.
2445000	2450000	And yes, national debt is a little different than personal debt and stuff like that.
2450000	2454000	But what you are beginning to see is essentially what we saw in Detroit.
2454000	2456000	So people are like, oh, my house will be worth less.
2456000	2457000	That's great.
2457000	2460000	Yeah, it's great if houses go down 20%, maybe 50%.
2460000	2463000	But when people know a house is always going to decrease in price,
2463000	2464000	it decreases to a dollar.
2464000	2467000	And when a house is a dollar, like what you saw in Detroit,
2467000	2469000	when a house is a dollar, there's no reason to maintain it
2469000	2471000	because houses cost a lot to maintain.
2471000	2474000	As anyone who is a homeowner knows, you put so much money into your house.
2474000	2478000	But you justify it because, OK, well, it's an asset that I own
2478000	2480000	and people stop investing in assets that way.
2480000	2483000	So the whole way we relate to money and the economy is going to change.
2483000	2487000	So endless urban blight, economy is not functioning the way that they're supposed to function.
2487000	2489000	So then what happens?
2489000	2491000	Well, where do people begin to invest?
2491000	2493000	One is what happens in a negative scenario?
2493000	2495000	So negative scenario, and this is what I'm terrified of,
2495000	2500000	is the developed world finds a cheat code, which is immigrants.
2500000	2504000	What they realize is that they can cheese their collapsing population
2504000	2506000	through mass immigration.
2506000	2511000	But this cheat code only works if they keep really the only collection
2511000	2514000	of countries that has an above repopulation rate right now,
2514000	2516000	which is mostly in Africa, desperately poor.
2516000	2519000	So now you have an economic incentive, a gun to the head
2519000	2524000	of the entire developed world that Africa must stay in desperate poverty.
2524000	2528000	Oh, you use Africa almost like a breeding ground
2528000	2532000	to create the future population to be pulled across into other countries.
2532000	2535000	Yeah, it's sick, but that seems to be like when I talk to them,
2535000	2538000	that's like actually the going plan right now.
2538000	2540000	But I don't think it's going to work.
2540000	2542000	I don't think that that plan is going to work so we can ignore it.
2542000	2543000	So what really happens?
2543000	2545000	Well, because their economies are going to collapse
2545000	2547000	before they can do that sort of mass.
2547000	2549000	Right now you're getting a lot of immigrants,
2549000	2550000	but it's immigrants who want to leave.
2550000	2553000	And I think what a lot of people forget is a lot of people don't want to leave.
2553000	2555000	Even when Ireland was suffering the potato famine,
2555000	2557000	what a lot of people don't know is that the landlords,
2557000	2560000	there was a rash of landlord murders at the time.
2560000	2562000	And so they got scared.
2562000	2565000	And so they would sometimes, I don't know how frequently,
2565000	2569000	offer to pay for all of their tenants to go to America on coffinships.
2569000	2571000	It was horrible, but at least it was the idea.
2571000	2575000	That's the way I think many people would be imported these days, right?
2575000	2578000	So a horrible immigration, but at least, you know,
2578000	2581000	they had the option to leave during the potato famine during this time
2581000	2584000	when people would walk into town and they saw everyone was dead
2584000	2587000	and then the corpses would start animating and they realized that they were just starting.
2587000	2591000	Like it was bad, but the majority, a lot of people wanted to stay.
2591000	2594000	And so I think what they're going to realize is that this,
2594000	2596000	this trickle of immigrants that we have right now,
2596000	2600000	it's pretty close to the max trickle of immigrants you can get.
2600000	2603000	And it's only just offsetting population collapse right now.
2603000	2605000	And when they get to the US, when they get to Europe,
2605000	2606000	their fertility rate collapsed.
2606000	2610000	First generation immigrants in the US only have a fertility rate of 1.7,
2610000	2611000	well below repopulation rate.
2611000	2614000	So it's not like you could just bring immigrants and they solve the problem.
2614000	2615000	You need to keep importing people.
2615000	2617000	But anyway, okay.
2617000	2618000	Ignore all this.
2618000	2619000	Okay.
2619000	2620000	So world's collapsing.
2620000	2621000	Where do you put your money?
2621000	2623000	If on average, the economy is collapsing.
2623000	2626000	This is where it gets cool because we get something we haven't had in a long time.
2626000	2628000	Individual human lives start to matter.
2628000	2630000	Individual human cultures start to matter.
2630000	2634000	If you have a cultural group that has a high fertility rate and is technophilic,
2634000	2636000	like they engage with technology.
2636000	2639000	And even if they're technophobic, but less of their technophobic,
2639000	2641000	that becomes a group you want to invest in.
2641000	2646000	That becomes a place you want to place money because that's the only place
2646000	2650000	that you can be fairly sure is going to grow in aggregate in the future.
2650000	2655000	And that creates a totally different world economy than the one we have now.
2655000	2657000	And it's a very interesting world economy.
2657000	2661000	And so when people say like, what actually is our foundation sort of doing?
2661000	2665000	Really, what we're doing is we're trying to identify those groups right now
2665000	2669000	and build connections between them so that we can have a pluralistic group
2669000	2671000	of thriving economies of the willing.
2671000	2674000	And of the willing, what I mean is the people who were willing to have kids,
2674000	2678000	willing to give those kids a good enough life that they wanted to stay in that culture.
2678000	2684000	Since learning about the current trends of population collapse, declining birth rates, etc.
2684000	2687000	I've started to view a lot of the problems that we're facing,
2687000	2693000	especially the cultural ways that people see dating, family life, having kids,
2693000	2698000	relationships with their parents, the future of the world through a very different lens.
2698000	2703000	And there's a trend at the moment that's only recently, like within the last couple of months,
2703000	2705000	I've started seeing come out on the internet,
2705000	2711000	which is one of men in their 20s getting vasectomies as a protest against feminists
2711000	2714000	that want to be able to have free and easy sex.
2714000	2718000	It's literally like a clap back where you've got the pill, I'm going to get the snip.
2718000	2720000	Have you seen this?
2720000	2725000	I'm a fan. I mean, I focus more on the trans maxing movement. Have you heard of that?
2725000	2726000	No, what's trans maxing?
2726000	2728000	Oh, it's fascinating.
2728000	2733000	So it's a group of guys who are not like traditional transit that they don't have gender dysphoria.
2733000	2735000	They don't feel like they were born the wrong gender.
2735000	2739000	They're just like, as a guy and as a not particularly attractive or not particularly wealthy guy,
2739000	2744000	I got dealt a bad hand. Hormone therapy is easy to get access to these days.
2744000	2748000	I'm going to become a woman. And that's what it is.
2748000	2750000	With what goal? What's the goal of it?
2750000	2752000	The goal is to get an easier life.
2752000	2756000	I mean, if you've been consuming a fire hose of red pill and migtail content,
2756000	2760000	you know, it can sound like a pretty good idea to a lot of people, I think.
2760000	2763000	Oh, because women have got it so much easier than men do.
2763000	2767000	Therefore, if I become the closest thing that I can to a woman, it's going to fix all of my problem.
2767000	2776000	Okay, fair enough. I mean, yeah, that that is an approach and the optional elected vasectomy in your 20s thing.
2776000	2782000	I think sort of sit on the shelf next to each other for I wouldn't have predicted this on my 2023 bingo card.
2782000	2788000	But yeah, so just everything that I see, you know, this stophavingkids.org who you may be familiar with,
2788000	2791000	like this really serious anti-nateless movement.
2791000	2795000	Have you heard of the involuntary anti-nateless movement?
2795000	2798000	They want to they want to sterilize the entire population.
2798000	2800000	They're like terrorists. They're just scary people.
2800000	2804000	Wow. And what's the justification for this? I'm going to guess climate.
2804000	2807000	Oh, no. So they're really just negative utilitarians.
2807000	2813000	I think most anti-natalism and for people who aren't familiar with negative utilitarianism,
2813000	2819000	it's the belief that negative emotions are bad but positive emotions aren't inherently good
2819000	2825000	or that a human life, a negative emotions are more acute than positive emotions.
2825000	2827000	Are they just much higher in volume?
2827000	2830000	The best the best the best example of this that I learned from a friend was
2830000	2835000	imagine that you got to spend the rest of your life in the optimal amount of bliss,
2835000	2839000	maxing out your pleasure, compare this to an existence where for the remainder of your life,
2839000	2844000	you were spent in maximum torture with as much pain as you can imagine.
2844000	2847000	Or let's say that you did one and then did the other would one be worth the other
2847000	2852000	and most people have an inclination that suffering is somehow worse than pain that you are in
2852000	2860000	and then you net out after a human life, what was the group that involuntary anti-natalists
2860000	2862000	because of negative utilitarians?
2862000	2863000	Yeah.
2863000	2867000	They basically say that a human life is net suffering overall.
2867000	2872000	Therefore, it is morally reprehensible to bring any future life into this world
2872000	2877000	because the net experience is one of pain and torment and displeasure.
2877000	2878000	Yeah.
2878000	2884000	And I actually suspect that when we see this urban monoculture I've described begin to really dwindle in size
2884000	2887000	and the only people who are left are the most extremist was in it.
2887000	2891000	We're going to begin to have to deal with terrorists on that front and that really scares me.
2891000	2895000	But here's the thing, who's to know we aren't already dealing with terrorists on that front?
2895000	2898000	Look at declining fertility rates around the world today.
2898000	2901000	Biological fertility, declining sperm counts, declining testosterone.
2901000	2903000	Who's to say there isn't something in the water?
2903000	2904000	You know what I mean?
2904000	2906000	Do you think that someone's purposefully doing this?
2906000	2907000	I don't know, man.
2907000	2911000	I would hazard toward Hanlon's razor with stuff like this.
2911000	2912000	Yeah.
2912000	2921000	The incentives align for people to believe that they're doing something which is sympathetic, empathetic,
2921000	2925000	caring, whether it be because of the environment, whether it be...
2926000	2930000	The environmental thing is such an interesting argument to me
2930000	2936000	because if you think that a planet that has too many people on it is bad for the planet,
2936000	2940000	wait until you see what a planet that has too few people on it is like.
2940000	2943000	Oh, well, we existed 200 years ago.
2943000	2946000	There was only half a billion people or a billion people or whatever on the planet.
2946000	2948000	The planet's been fine with this many people on before.
2948000	2951000	It's like, yeah, but what's the experience of the life like for the people that are on it?
2951000	2953000	What about all of the animals that you want to save?
2953000	2957000	What about all of the interjections that you want to make with regards to controlling the climate
2957000	2961000	to ensuring that all of the different ecosystems that you care about continue?
2961000	2965000	So I've had a lot of pushback about talking about declining birth rates
2965000	2970000	and whatever you want to say, like dating sphere adjacent sometimes.
2970000	2974000	Although I'm speaking to the researchers, I'm not doing a panel show with a bunch of different people
2974000	2979000	screaming at them saying that they're going to become loveless harpies in their 30s.
2980000	2987000	I feel like the criticisms that people have about anybody that brings up declining birth rates
2987000	2990000	either haven't thought about the problem sufficiently well
2990000	2993000	or have a really, really perverse and malicious incentive
2993000	2998000	because anybody that sees a discussion about declining birth rates
2998000	3002000	is anything other than a concern for the future of human lives that haven't yet existed.
3002000	3005000	They're just not philosophically sophisticated.
3005000	3009000	Yeah, I'm totally open. I'm totally open to having the discussion
3009000	3015000	that maybe there is an optimal amount of population that would be great to have on the Earth.
3015000	3020000	I think the carrying capacity of the planet is significantly higher than where we're at at the moment.
3020000	3024000	And I think that climate mastery and all the rest of it we have a ton of work to do
3024000	3028000	for a whole host of things, whether that be AI alignment, whether that be grey goo from nanotechnology
3028000	3031000	but like pick your existential risk of choice, right?
3032000	3034000	But like fuck off, bro.
3034000	3040000	If you think that I'm not going to talk about the most existential of existential risks individually to you
3040000	3042000	and here's the other thing.
3042000	3045000	So folding this in, a lot of people will have listened to the Steven Shaw episode that I did
3045000	3047000	which was absolutely fantastic.
3047000	3050000	I really love him as a demographer and a researcher in this world.
3050000	3055000	And the novel, an interesting insight, the really novel interesting insight
3055000	3060000	that I'm going to kind of add into my worldview with regards to this that I've learned from you today
3060000	3066000	is looking at what happens when you roll the clock forward over a longer timeline
3066000	3070000	with which groups are going to continue to survive and which cultures are going to continue to survive.
3070000	3080000	If it's the case that you say that you care about a particular movement continuing to be pushed through the ages
3080000	3085000	because this is something that we should care about, let's say it's reducing the amount of people that are on the planet
3085000	3087000	to restrict climate change.
3087000	3090000	Let's just say that it's climate change overall, right?
3090000	3096000	If you have, given the fact that political leaning is 50% heritable,
3096000	3102000	if you don't have any children, who do you think is going to continue that particular philosophy that you've got?
3102000	3106000	Like you are literally making your ideology a dying breed.
3108000	3110000	No, I couldn't agree more.
3110000	3115000	And I think one of the things that I always think, you know, when you're talking about biodiversity and stuff like this,
3115000	3118000	I always wondered, like, do these people not think into the future?
3118000	3123000	Right now, from what we know about our planet, humans are the only species that can seed a new biome.
3123000	3126000	We are the only species that can get off planet, right?
3126000	3131000	So if we seed a new biome in a million and 10 million years, it'll be just as rich as our own.
3131000	3135000	We could seed thousands, hundreds of thousands of new biomes.
3135000	3140000	If humanity doesn't win through this eye of the needle we're about to go through,
3140000	3144000	if humanity does die off, well, I mean, everything we know about physics today
3144000	3147000	says the sun will eventually expand and all life will go extinct.
3147000	3149000	It's in game.
3149000	3158000	You know, if you care about biodiversity in the long run, humans are critical to maximizing that.
3158000	3161000	Although I will modify one thing you said.
3161000	3166000	I think that there is a logical argument for negative utilitarianism.
3166000	3170000	I think there's a logical argument for getting rid of humans.
3170000	3172000	I don't agree with it.
3172000	3180000	These people are against my cultural group, but I don't think that they're just, like, completely insane either.
3180000	3185000	Do you think it's a moral obligation to have children, then, with all of this sort of folded together?
3185000	3190000	I think different people have different moral frameworks they're optimizing for.
3190000	3195000	I think if somebody believes that their moral framework should continue to exist into the future,
3195000	3198000	200, 300 years into the future, like gender equality or something like that,
3198000	3201000	and you don't have kids, you have morally failed.
3201000	3207000	If you, however, are just like, no, it doesn't matter if my belief system dies out with me,
3207000	3212000	then whatever, you know, I'm not going to tell you that your morals are wrong
3212000	3217000	because I think that morality is one of those things where I believe that my morals are right,
3217000	3221000	if I go around trying to police everyone else's morality, I'm just going to have a bad time.
3221000	3227000	So that line in the sand is one I've been really interested in playing about with.
3227000	3236000	I absolutely agree that some sort of handmade tale future where women are kept in pens like cows
3236000	3239000	so that they can keep the future of the population going is wrong.
3239000	3246000	Also, telling women that the only way that you can live a fulfilling life is by doing some domestic version of that.
3246000	3252000	Also is wrong, but I can't see why there isn't any sympathy out there in the world
3252000	3254000	for the reverse of this situation.
3254000	3259000	What about all of the people who were told you don't need to have kids to have a fulfilling life
3259000	3263000	that did want to become mothers that had their preferences nudged in the opposite direction,
3263000	3266000	break through the fertility window and then grieve for families that they never had,
3266000	3270000	that where is the finger pointing going in the other direction?
3270000	3276000	Because I don't see anybody unironically saying that women need to get out of the boardroom
3276000	3279000	and get back in the bedroom to start producing more children.
3279000	3287000	I think that they're just saying, look, maybe you should think about the current cultural norms that are being pushed
3287000	3290000	and take them with a big spoonful of salt.
3290000	3293000	Yeah, and I think that a lot of statistics women just aren't familiar with.
3293000	3296000	Things that made my wife feel a lot more comfortable if you look at studies.
3296000	3299000	Not all studies show this, but a number of them do.
3299000	3302000	Is that parent households with two working parents,
3302000	3307000	the kids actually perform better academically and have better emotional health than parents with stay at home.
3307000	3308000	It's a small effect.
3308000	3314000	But what I'm saying is, is that I think that there's this intuition that only the traditional way of doing things is correct.
3314000	3321000	And that the truth is, is what is correct is whatever ends up working in the long term for human civilization,
3321000	3323000	because nothing is really working right now.
3323000	3328000	And so I just encourage people to, if they think I can't be a mom and in the boardroom,
3328000	3331000	I would encourage you to rethink the way you're structuring your family,
3331000	3333000	rethink the way you're structuring finding a partner.
3333000	3335000	You know, earlier we were talking about dating markets,
3335000	3342000	and one of the things that our foundation is doing is we're working to try to create and promote new types of dating apps,
3342000	3346000	maybe even recreate the London season, you know, something like that,
3346000	3351000	but the travels between places like the Olympics where you have, you know, a bunch of the single people go,
3351000	3356000	but there's some rules that make it harder to just have a really low switching cost between partners,
3356000	3359000	which is one of the big problems that we're dealing with right now.
3359000	3363000	So it was a lot of this is about experimenting with new social technologies
3363000	3366000	and understanding that there probably are ways to have it all,
3366000	3373000	much more than I think people want to accept because it requires trying new things and being called a freak by other people.
3373000	3377000	What about people that say it's too expensive to bring a child into this world?
3377000	3380000	Why? Why are poorer people having more kids?
3380000	3386000	If it's an issue of cost, then what you should see is a line where people have more kids,
3386000	3390000	the more money they have, but typically the line goes in the other direction within and between countries
3390000	3394000	until you get to like ludicrous levels of wealth, like half a million dollars a year.
3394000	3397000	So what I'd say is it's enormously expensive.
3397000	3400000	It is a massive lifestyle sacrifice.
3400000	3405000	It absolutely is a lifestyle sacrifice, but is it too expensive?
3405000	3406000	I think that's the real thing.
3406000	3409000	Is it too expensive? Is it that you can't afford it?
3409000	3411000	Or is it that you would need to like us?
3411000	3413000	We had to leave a city. We moved to a rural area.
3413000	3416000	We changed the type of jobs we could get because of that.
3416000	3418000	We made a lot of sacrifices to do this.
3418000	3423000	And I understand that for families in less socially economically advantaged positions,
3423000	3425000	they have to make even more sacrifices.
3425000	3430000	But when a family decides they want a lot of kids, they do it.
3430000	3432000	And I think in addition to that, this is another area.
3432000	3434000	One of the projects that we worked in was Project Eureka,
3434000	3437000	which was a town for like single moms that had kids
3437000	3439000	and other people who had kids and who wanted to co-raise kids
3439000	3442000	because there are social technologies we can try.
3442000	3447000	And I would really like to see these commune systems and stuff like that begin to pop up more
3447000	3453000	because I think as an investment prospect, they are a really good long-term investment prospect
3453000	3456000	if you look at the model that I was talking about earlier.
3456000	3460000	The challenges of...
3460000	3463000	The reason that people say it's too expensive to bring a child into this world,
3463000	3467000	I don't think that they're talking about the cost on their finances.
3467000	3469000	I think they're talking about the cost on their freedom.
3469000	3471000	Oh, yeah.
3471000	3477000	If you look at the reasons that are given for a lot of non-daters at the moment
3477000	3479000	for people that are checking out of the dating market,
3479000	3484000	it's just got better things to do, not wanting to lose personal freedom.
3484000	3487000	There's this huge, huge study that was done by Pew.
3487000	3490000	And it just came back that people were just distracted.
3490000	3495000	So what it seems is that if you are more financially enabled,
3495000	3499000	there are more things that you can do with your finances,
3499000	3501000	which means that you can go abroad to Bali.
3501000	3503000	Why not go to Bali for two weeks?
3503000	3505000	Well, if you have the kid, you can't go to Bali for two weeks.
3505000	3508000	The girl with the list thing, which you must have seen that came off TikTok,
3508000	3511000	a girl printed out 350 reasons not to have a child
3511000	3513000	and then printed them all on a piece of paper.
3513000	3515000	The reasons ranged from stuff like,
3515000	3517000	a child is literally a parasite inside of you
3517000	3520000	who can't wear my cute high heels anymore,
3520000	3523000	can't do brunch on Sundays.
3523000	3525000	Yeah. So I want to get into this. I'm really excited.
3525000	3529000	So there are, I think, two core reasons that people don't have kids
3529000	3531000	within the category that you're talking about here.
3531000	3534000	It's because they're optimizing for their personal happiness.
3534000	3537000	Now, this can be broad satisfaction, contentment, whatever word you want to use,
3537000	3540000	but it's some sort of emotional optimization
3540000	3544000	or they're optimizing for their own position within a local status hierarchy.
3544000	3548000	This can be showing off to people on Twitter or whatever, you know,
3548000	3551000	the trips that you're doing or the things that you're doing with your life
3551000	3556000	because you think that these make you, you know, like better or higher within some group.
3556000	3560000	As soon as you're not optimizing for one of those two things,
3560000	3565000	typically having kids, or I suppose you could say that I'm trying to make the world a better place
3565000	3571000	along some sort of framework like donating to like protecting ecology or something like that.
3571000	3573000	A lot of that loops back to status though.
3573000	3575000	Yeah, a lot of that loops back to status.
3575000	3578000	So I think what we're going to see, and this is really cool
3578000	3580000	because it's going to change what it means to be human.
3580000	3584000	When people, I mean, even more than the other options people have right now,
3584000	3588000	when Robosexuality, I always go back to the Futureama episode about this,
3588000	3590000	that predicted this, when people can start dating AIs
3590000	3593000	and you can have your deep fake girlfriend and stuff like that,
3593000	3595000	and then eventually people will be able to go into pods
3595000	3598000	and live any virtual reality lifestyle they want.
3598000	3600000	When these sorts of things become possible,
3600000	3604000	and they likely will within my grandkids' lifetime at least, if not our own,
3604000	3609000	pretty much everyone who's optimizing for status or personal pleasure
3609000	3611000	is going to be cold from the gene pool.
3611000	3616000	And any cultural group that can't motivate people to optimize for something else
3616000	3618000	is going to be removed from the system,
3618000	3621000	and that is going to fundamentally change what it means to be human,
3621000	3626000	and likely have a pretty big impact on sort of the human sociological profile
3626000	3628000	in terms of the genetic screening that's going to cause.
3629000	3632000	It's going to nudge the genetic disposition
3632000	3638000	because the only cohorts that are left are going to have a particular type of predisposition.
3638000	3640000	And over time that's going to, right?
3640000	3641000	Yeah, that's really, really interesting.
3641000	3645000	Because, you know, we all have this balance between
3645000	3648000	hedonic pleasure and meaning that we seek in the future.
3648000	3650000	You know, most parents, I don't think,
3650000	3653000	if you were to test them on a minute-by-minute basis,
3653000	3657000	it's not the most pleasurable thing in the world to raise a child,
3657000	3659000	and I'm looking at some of the studies that I've seen.
3659000	3663000	It's not massively pleasurable, but it's incredibly meaningful.
3663000	3666000	And, you know, there has to be some sort of a spectrum
3666000	3670000	where on one side someone lives for a life that in retrospect they're glad they're lived,
3670000	3674000	and on the other side someone lives a life that moment to moment they're happy that they're living.
3674000	3676000	And, you know, that spectrum between the two,
3676000	3680000	am I living for a future that's meaning, or am I living for a now that's pleasure?
3680000	3682000	Yeah, I'm so excited.
3682000	3684000	Well, I love what you're getting at here,
3684000	3686000	which is how do you balance these two?
3686000	3689000	And the really cool thing is that biologically,
3689000	3692000	we're already optimized to have kids.
3692000	3696000	And I think a lot of the unhappiness that comes in society today
3696000	3701000	is that people forget that all of your ancestors had kids.
3701000	3703000	They had sex, and they had kids.
3703000	3705000	They're almost all of them dead, right?
3705000	3710000	And so humans are programmed to find genuine contentment and happiness
3710000	3715000	of a deeper kind and a more meaningful kind than they can get from almost anything else
3715000	3720000	from continuing down the path that had led to our species being successful so far.
3720000	3722000	And I think when you look at a lot of influencers right now,
3722000	3726000	if you look at a lot of unhappiness, they are showing people
3726000	3732000	what people are sort of biologically optimized for right after they go through puberty
3732000	3737000	without people realizing that that optimization program changes as you get older.
3737000	3740000	Often there's a joke that I got in trouble for on Twitter,
3740000	3742000	which is to say that I don't know if you know Blippi.
3742000	3746000	He's like a blues clue sort of character who dances around around fire trucks for kids
3746000	3749000	and is like, yeah, I'm driving a fire truck.
3749000	3751000	I'm playing in a dump truck.
3751000	3753000	I'm playing on the playground, you know, and kids are like,
3753000	3756000	all this is the perfect life before they go through puberty.
3756000	3757000	They see this. That's what they're optimized for.
3757000	3759000	They're optimized for play and exploration.
3759000	3763000	As an adult, you see this and you're like, oh my God, his life looks terrible.
3763000	3765000	I mean, obviously he probably makes a lot of money,
3765000	3767000	but I mean, you wouldn't actually want to live that way.
3767000	3772000	And I often argue that Andrew Tate is sort of the Blippi for teenagers.
3772000	3776000	This is what a teenage boy thinks is the ideal adult life.
3776000	3781000	But to an actual grown man, you see this and you can see sort of the deadness
3781000	3785000	within his eyes and he's like, yeah, I have to please multiple women a day
3785000	3789000	or they'll leave me and then I won't be able to maintain sort of the thing that I built up.
3789000	3793000	And I'm like, oh my God, I can't even imagine having to just have a routine
3793000	3797000	of constantly having sex every day so that I can at a base level
3797000	3799000	maintain my economic empire.
3799000	3802000	But to a young boy, this sounds, oh, that's the best
3802000	3805000	because humans go through a second puberty when they have kids.
3805000	3807000	Your testosterone drops dramatically.
3807000	3810000	You begin to gain happiness from different sources
3810000	3812000	and it's a deeper kind of happiness.
3812000	3814000	And with young women, it's the same thing.
3814000	3817000	With young women, they get told, oh, you're going to love traveling the world.
3817000	3819000	You're going to love a certain point.
3819000	3825000	Love just becomes drawl, you know, because you were biologically programmed
3825000	3829000	to want to know not everyone is, you know, people's biological programming is a bit different.
3829000	3833000	You know, I could say that on average, human males are biologically programmed
3833000	3835000	to find human females attractive.
3835000	3838000	But obviously not all human males find human females attractive.
3838000	3840000	So a few people don't go through this shift later in life.
3840000	3844000	But when you optimize around the things that give you happiness,
3844000	3848000	when you were a teenager and your whole society tells you to optimize around those things,
3848000	3852000	you hit middle age and you're like, why doesn't anything really make me happy anymore?
3852000	3854000	Why aren't video games making me happy anymore?
3854000	3856000	Why aren't the things I used to do?
3856000	3859000	Why does these status games not make me happy anymore?
3859000	3864000	And it's because your culture used to tell you, hey, you need to move on to your next stage of life,
3864000	3868000	but you don't have that culture anymore because you're in this bubble.
3868000	3877000	Going back to what you said about status and how status provides a incentive
3877000	3883000	for people to behave in particular ways, ways that allow them to advertise their fancy trip to Bali
3883000	3887000	and brunch and whatever on a Sunday on social media.
3887000	3896000	Have you considered a way of reprogramming statusful activities so that motherhood becomes pedestalized again?
3896000	3902000	I hate to say this, but I think for most of the population, people are like, oh, why don't you force them to?
3902000	3906000	I talk with some people and they're like, what about like banning porn or banning, you know, whatever, right?
3906000	3908000	Like would that force people to do this?
3908000	3911000	And it's like, look, or banning social media, right?
3911000	3918000	The cultural groups and people who aren't resistant to the existing pressures in this world that are sterilizing them,
3918000	3921000	unfortunately, they're just kind of a lost cause.
3921000	3926000	What we need to do is we need to find the few groups that have found a way to make themselves resistant to this
3926000	3932000	and sort of nurture them so that they can survive through this period and then end up thriving,
3932000	3934000	which is why we focus on things like trying to...
3934000	3939000	It's not like humans are, well, it depends on your view of free will, I suppose,
3939000	3941000	but we're not exactly deterministic beings, right?
3941000	3946000	If we're able to nudge the culture in a way to get people to change their behavior, you know, people...
3946000	3948000	I had Peter Singer on the show yesterday.
3948000	3952000	Peter Singer managed to impact so many people's lives through animal liberation
3952000	3955000	that wouldn't have done that without him nudging them in that way.
3955000	3958000	There is status that was associated with being vegan.
3958000	3960000	Therefore, people started doing it.
3960000	3962000	They were also brought into this philosophy that underpinned it.
3962000	3964000	I'm a club promoter by trade, right?
3964000	3966000	I ran nightclubs for my entire career.
3966000	3970000	And with that, I understand the power of trends and mimesis.
3970000	3978000	I'm just thinking, at the moment, there is a mimetic trend about, like, motherhoods' lame or dangerous or freedom restricting.
3978000	3984000	Changing that trend technology seems something that could be quite a high-leverage opportunity.
3984000	3988000	Delta, you changed your mind on this, and I'm remembering conversations,
3988000	3991000	because this is actually a debate I've had with my wife, and she's changed my mind before, but I forgot.
3992000	3998000	Which is, I think, well, she would argue, a core aspect of our advocacy, if we can,
3998000	4004000	is to get it modeled in television shows and in other types of popular media
4004000	4007000	that having lots of kids is a high-status thing.
4007000	4013000	The big fear I have is I'm just really afraid of people having kids because it helps their status.
4013000	4019000	I would like it if it's like a yes and thing, but no matter what, when you make something a status thing,
4019000	4025000	there's going to be a group of kids that are brought into the world only because of the way they augment the parent's status.
4025000	4030000	And that means that their parents are going to be narcissists, and they're going to be pretty...
4030000	4031000	But you're right.
4031000	4035000	I mean, hopefully we can move culture in a way that doesn't just target the narcissist.
4035000	4036000	That's more holistic.
4036000	4046000	Yeah, so we're about to get on to talking about another third rail of your approach to sort of embryo screening and genetic selection and stuff.
4046000	4054000	But do you see it almost like, for one of a better word, like a breeding experiment that we have,
4054000	4059000	not an experiment, but a breeding future that we have with humans,
4059000	4062000	where there are going to be particular cohorts that continue.
4062000	4064000	There are going to be particular cohorts that don't,
4064000	4067000	given that a good chunk of our behavior is determined by our genes.
4067000	4072000	The type of people that continue to reproduce will have a particular genetic predisposition,
4072000	4077000	which means that we're going to nudge the entire human race's genetic predisposition in one direction.
4077000	4082000	Are we in the middle of a breeding experiment and are humans facing extinction?
4082000	4087000	I'd say it's a cultural experiment because the independent factor that's being changed is culture.
4087000	4092000	And the dependent variable that we're measuring is their ability to have kids, so breed,
4092000	4095000	but also maintain those kids within that social group.
4095000	4099000	So if the kids just leave or they don't like their lifestyle as a child,
4099000	4103000	you can't just give a kid a terrible childhood or they're not going to continue that cultural group.
4103000	4109000	And there has to be, this is actually a really interesting phenomenon here,
4109000	4113000	where if you look at countries that are poorer but also have really low fertility rates,
4113000	4118000	typically the common thing across those countries is that there is very low amounts of hope.
4118000	4123000	This is why China has such a low fertility rate, because people was in China,
4123000	4126000	this is where the, we are the last generation meme comes from.
4126000	4128000	They're like, what am I just having kids so the government can use them?
4128000	4131000	Like there's no more like social mobility here or something like this.
4131000	4134000	And I think it's why when you're looking at a cultural group like Jews and Israel,
4134000	4140000	there's such a high fertility rate as there is a high level of cultural hope within that cultural group.
4140000	4144000	They feel like when they have kids, they're not just, you know, grits for the grindstone.
4144000	4149000	They can move up within the culture, even if they're in a low status position.
4149000	4154000	So I would agree with everything you're saying, and I'm really excited for this experiment.
4154000	4165000	I imagine that the discussions around climate are just another really pernicious sort of convincing factor
4165000	4167000	about why people shouldn't have kids.
4167000	4171000	Not only are you contributing to the burning of fossil fuels,
4171000	4175000	not only are you going to increase greenhouse gases, which are going to kill all of these other animals,
4175000	4181000	but the life that your child is going to have on this planet is also going to be filled with fumes and grey skies,
4181000	4183000	and it's going to be toxic and whatever.
4183000	4188000	But this is, I was going to say, this is also just the latest apocalyptic cult in the US, you know,
4188000	4190000	and it's not going to be the last one, you know.
4190000	4198000	We keep having, if the US is dotted by anything, it's dotted by sort of apocalypticism and fears.
4198000	4202000	The US actually, Jewish and Christian traditions more generally are dotted by this.
4202000	4204000	And I think the next one we're going to see is AI.
4204000	4206000	Why would you have kids when AI is going to kill us all?
4206000	4210000	You know, it's just a cycle and it keeps going.
4210000	4214000	You do know that there's people watching this right now that is saying,
4214000	4215000	well, what about you two?
4215000	4217000	You two are just saying that it's the birth rate decline apocalypse.
4217000	4220000	You're the same Cassandra as that you're accusing everyone else of being.
4220000	4226000	Well, because I would say that I do argue that things are going to get worse,
4226000	4228000	but I don't argue they're going to kill us all.
4228000	4234000	I think if you look at real climate change data, it says, which I believe the climate is going to get worse.
4234000	4238000	A lot of suffering is going to happen because of it, but it's not going to kill us all.
4238000	4241000	That climate message hasn't done as well as spreading as, you know,
4241000	4246000	Greta Thornberg's and one of your recent podcasts is that everyone's going to be dead in five years due to the climate.
4246000	4250000	AI is going to massively change what it means to be human.
4250000	4255000	It could even cause some major catastrophes, but it's not going to turn us all into goo.
4255000	4262000	And so I think that there is, it's right to say that we in the world have actual things to be afraid of.
4262000	4266000	There's going to be actual systemic shifts, but I think that's different than just apocalypticism
4266000	4269000	and being like, we're all going to die. No need to think about the future.
4269000	4271000	You know, Harold camping style, right?
4271000	4276000	OK, so the Millerist movement getting on to what you did with your children.
4276000	4280000	We've discussed what the world should do, how we should move forward.
4280000	4282000	Some of the challenges, some of the reasons that people don't.
4282000	4288000	What is the unique process that you went through with your wife?
4288000	4292000	So this is spicy.
4292000	4298000	What we did is we did full genetic sequencing of our embryos and we use those genetic
4298000	4302000	sequencing to inform the order in which we implanted the embryos.
4302000	4303000	So why did we do this?
4303000	4308000	Well, you have to do biopsies of embryos anyways, often to determine if they're halfway
4308000	4310000	or not. Not everyone does this, but most people do.
4310000	4312000	It's the normal thing you do when you're doing IVF.
4312000	4317000	We had to do IVF anyway because my wife was unable to get pregnant naturally due to, you know,
4317000	4320000	having depression when she was younger, which caused her to develop anorexia,
4320000	4323000	which meant that she doesn't like mistreat naturally.
4323000	4326000	And she actually was trans women.
4326000	4333000	She often doesn't like competition to see who has to take more hormones to be a woman.
4333000	4338000	And so, you know, she has to do all of this stuff to have kids.
4338000	4339000	So I had to do IVF anyway.
4339000	4340000	We had to do the biopsies anyway.
4340000	4344000	And now with genetic screening data, we could go through that and her mom died
4344000	4345000	solely of cancer.
4345000	4346000	And so we were able to look at that.
4346000	4349000	And, you know, she suffered from major depressive disorder, which also has genetic
4349000	4350000	feelings.
4350000	4354000	So we were able to look at these things and say, well, I mean, if we can choose to
4354000	4359000	lower the probability that our kids have to deal with these genetic conditions,
4359000	4362000	like, would we lower that probability?
4362000	4365000	Like, to me, people are like, yeah, but people will make fun of you on Twitter
4365000	4366000	if you do this.
4366000	4370000	It's like, yeah, okay, my kid comes to me and they're like, dad, I really, you know,
4370000	4372000	want to kill myself right now or have migraines.
4372000	4374000	That was another thing we selected against.
4374000	4377000	You could have selected against this and you didn't because people were going to make
4377000	4378000	fun of you on Twitter.
4378000	4381000	Like, and this is just our cultural group.
4381000	4383000	So people try to connect this with eugenics.
4383000	4386000	But eugenics, the definition of eugenics is very clear.
4386000	4390000	It's the belief that there's good and bad genes and that the good genes should be distributed
4390000	4394000	maximally throughout society, which is sort of the antithesis of what we believe.
4394000	4399000	We believe every family, every cultural unit has beliefs about good and bad genes, right?
4399000	4401000	Like our family doesn't want our kids to get cancer.
4401000	4407000	But that reproductive choice should always be in the hands of individual families and
4407000	4410000	individual cultural groups and that it should never be enacted.
4410000	4414000	If anything, I would say that it's eugenics for the government to come and tell my family
4414000	4420000	the genetic choices we should make because it views sort of pure, unaltered human DNA
4420000	4423000	as the superior form of humanity.
4423000	4427000	Like they're actually saying we need genetic purity in humanity and you're tainting the
4427000	4431000	genetic purity of the human species by like selecting things.
4431000	4432000	I don't know.
4432000	4436000	To me, that sounds much more eugenics than me being like, I don't want my kids to get cancer.
4436000	4438000	And this is something many cultural groups have done over time.
4438000	4441000	Like Orthodox Jews have to do this with Tay Sacks.
4441000	4443000	Some black communities have to do this with sickle cell.
4443000	4448000	Like it's also like an anti-Semitic and racist position to call this sort of genetic
4448000	4453000	selection and this sort of reproductive choice eugenics.
4453000	4458000	So I think that we do support and I think now here's the thing.
4458000	4463000	That's the nice way to put all of this, but then let's go big or go home.
4463000	4465000	Let's be controversial here, right?
4465000	4468000	So what happens if we really hold this position in the future?
4468000	4474000	Well, when we say our foundation's goal is to preserve and increase human diversity,
4474000	4479000	a lot of people miss the and increase human diversity part because as soon as families
4479000	4484000	have these choices, a lot of people think families are all going to choose the same thing.
4484000	4485000	I love it.
4485000	4491000	People are like, isn't everyone going to choose like a white buff child?
4491000	4493000	And it's like, no, no.
4493000	4496000	Like black families aren't going to choose like little Aryan kids or something.
4496000	4498000	What are you out of your mind?
4498000	4504000	Everyone's going to choose things that optimize for their cultural traditions value system.
4504000	4508000	And we're entering into this grand experiment where some of those value systems will prove
4508000	4511000	to be more efficacious than other value systems.
4511000	4513000	Right now people are like, oh, you could select for IQ.
4513000	4517000	We didn't select for IQ, but you could theoretically select for IQ and we might do it in the future.
4517000	4522000	But IQ is such a like a bad metric because we're in the early days of this technology.
4522000	4525000	Eventually IQ will be 80 different things.
4525000	4527000	Are you optimizing for creativity?
4527000	4529000	Are you optimizing for in the same way?
4529000	4531000	You don't just optimize for strengths.
4531000	4532000	You optimize for agility.
4532000	4533000	You optimize for lean muscle.
4533000	4536000	You optimize for like this type of muscle fiber versus this type of muscle fiber.
4536000	4547000	And we will see this blossoming, I hope, of human diversity at a level that makes our existing ethnic diversity look trite.
4547000	4552000	And subcultures will be very intolerant to this new diversity, but I'm excited for it.
4552000	4558000	I'm excited for it because I think that when we have new perspectives, when we have new ways of doing things,
4558000	4562000	a new cultural optimization, we get something more beautiful.
4562000	4568000	And one of the core focuses of our foundation is trying to get the cost of this technology as low as possible.
4568000	4571000	And a lot of people, they hear about this technology and they go, oh, it must cost a fortune.
4571000	4573000	I mean, theoretically, it doesn't really.
4573000	4577000	You're looking at genome sequencing, which we've gotten tremendously cheap.
4577000	4582000	And then once the genome is sequenced, you're just comparing it to a data table.
4582000	4588000	So right now, you know, if you did this at the state level, it would be tremendously inexpensive to do.
4588000	4594000	And, you know, you could do this for like 50 cents a family and maybe like $50 per egg that's sequenced.
4594000	4599000	And when you compare this to the cost of IVF, that is like nothing.
4599000	4604000	And many states are already supporting IVF, like the UK, like Israel.
4604000	4613000	So to say that this technology could be widely available is not an irresponsible thing to claim at all.
4613000	4615000	And I'm really excited for it.
4615000	4627000	Can you see why some people would feel uncomfortable or feel that this is a controversial technology to start using to be able to select for particular traits that a child would have?
4627000	4635000	Yeah, I mean, I see that when the problem is that it's controversial, except in every specific instance.
4635000	4637000	It's controversial to your selecting that your kids don't get cancer.
4637000	4641000	It's controversial to your selecting that your kids don't get major depressive disorder.
4641000	4645000	And if you stopped me and my kid ended up committing suicide, are you at all to blame for that?
4645000	4647000	Do you take any responsibility?
4647000	4650000	And then people are like, well, this technology isn't foolproof.
4650000	4652000	It doesn't 100% prevent those things.
4652000	4659000	And that's like, you know, one of these religious extremists who don't want to do blood transfusions being for their kid, you know, when their kid's dying or something.
4659000	4662000	Like, well, blood transfusion doesn't always work.
4662000	4663000	It's like, so what?
4663000	4665000	You're giving your kid a chance.
4665000	4671000	I mean, smoking during pregnancy doesn't always cause your child to have tons of deformities, but it's probably not advised.
4671000	4672000	Yeah.
4672000	4675000	And I support the cultural groups that don't want to use this.
4675000	4677000	They may be right in the long term, you know?
4677000	4679000	Humanity is an experiment, right?
4679000	4681000	They may be right.
4681000	4682000	I may be wrong.
4682000	4684000	And the future will prove which group is right and wrong.
4684000	4689000	And we might might turn out that all of these decisions we're making, they don't end up making any difference, right?
4689000	4692000	All we're using this technology for right now is to order our eggs.
4692000	4697000	Now, suppose somebody was like, oh, yeah, but I just want to create tons of embryos and choose the best embryos, right?
4697000	4699000	And this is where I think you get the genuinely...
4699000	4700000	What do you mean?
4700000	4702000	Sorry, what do you mean when you say order your eggs?
4702000	4704000	Oh, it's the choice.
4704000	4710000	It determines the eggs we choose first, but we still hope to use all of our embryos.
4710000	4712000	Not eggs, embryos.
4712000	4717000	But so it's not like we're saying this human gets to exist or this human doesn't get to exist because of their genes.
4717000	4724000	But I mean, functionally, eventually, because my wife has a C-section with every pregnancy, they're probably eventually going to take it out to some extent we are doing that.
4724000	4735000	But I can understand, like when people say every human embryo is a life and you shouldn't be playing these games, that's the moral argument against what we're doing that I think holds the most water.
4735000	4745000	The way that I look at that argument is to say, well, IVF generally, which needs, you know, you need to discard some eggs often if you're going to do IVF in any sort of economically sustainable way.
4746000	4750000	It requires you discarding embryos and it expands the human fertility window.
4750000	4761000	So to me, from my cultural perspective, every human I decide not to have, like if somebody was like, okay, pick up this pin and a human doesn't exist in the future, I'll decide not to have a human.
4761000	4764000	If you pick up this pin, then I have functionally killed that human.
4764000	4774000	And so I can understand why like Catholic groups and stuff like that would look at what we're doing and say that, well, I think that humanity only starts at like sperm production.
4774000	4776000	Or at the production of an embryo.
4776000	4777000	And so I get that argument.
4777000	4778000	It's just not my cultural practice.
4778000	4786000	And I hope that they can at least understand the spirit with which we're doing this, which is to, you know, maximize the number of offspring we have and increase their quality of life.
4787000	4793000	If all that you're doing is playing around with the order of the embryos that you have, why does the order matter?
4794000	4797000	Well, because we likely won't be able to use all of them.
4797000	4798000	I mean, really,
4798000	4799000	Okay, but that's the same.
4799000	4802000	Like choosing the order is the same as discarding, right?
4802000	4804000	Yeah, it's probably functionally the same.
4804000	4808000	But I mean, again, I just don't know how I can explain to my kid.
4808000	4811000	Oh, yeah, you got cancer because I decided not to do this when it was.
4812000	4816000	So I had Johnny Anomaly on the show about two months ago.
4816000	4817000	And I love the guy.
4817000	4818000	Yeah.
4818000	4820000	He really, he really sort of opened my eyes to this.
4820000	4831000	And the most compelling argument that I heard was as soon as you concede that, let's say the testing that some Jewish groups, Ashkenazi Jews, I think go through.
4831000	4838000	To ensure that they don't partner up with, yeah, Tasek partner up with somebody that is going to give their child something that's awful.
4838000	4840000	The same thing occurs within other groups.
4840000	4855000	And then roll the clock forward a tiny little bit and you say, if we can select to avoid really, really reliably heritable cancer that is just every single woman all the way back for as long as I can research it has always had some form of cancer.
4855000	4869000	As soon as we can select for that to not happen, you open the door to say, well, okay, what's the difference between that and selecting for someone that's a little bit more conscientious because conscientiousness is associated with improved outcomes in life.
4869000	4872000	What about somebody that's not going to have depression?
4872000	4873000	What about somebody that's not going to have anxiety?
4873000	4884000	What about somebody that's blah, blah, blah, like as soon as you open the door to not having something negative, you also then look start to get into selecting toward positive traits too.
4884000	4888000	Is there a line that gets drawn in the sand for you with regards to this?
4888000	4892000	No, I believe every family should be able to make their own reproductive choices.
4892000	4895000	And when we talk about things like IQ, he's absolutely right.
4895000	4902000	If you look at this really rough thing we have now, IQ, that I hope we can break apart into a bunch of different things and get much more specific ways.
4902000	4910000	Right now, I mean, this is correlated with lower rates of rape, lower rates of incarceration, lower rates of, I mean, raping other people, lower rates of murdering other people.
4910000	4915000	Like there are real reasons why you may select for this.
4915000	4917000	And I love when people are like, oh, that's unethical.
4917000	4930000	And I'm like, we live in a culture today where it is normal to dope your kids with amphetamines so that they score slightly higher on standardized tests where people do these little things where they're like, what would I give for two points of IQ?
4930000	4936000	And yet the fact that you could make a selection here is off the table.
4936000	4939000	But we also need to consider that eventually as a species, we're going to have to do this.
4939000	4941000	And this is something that people just aren't talking about.
4941000	4945000	So if you look at, okay, dysgenic pressures.
4945000	4951000	So historically, like 50% of humans died, you know, in childhood or early in their life hood or something like that.
4951000	4952000	Right.
4952000	4956000	And this prevented a lot of the diseases that we see in our society today.
4956000	4967000	As we get better at things like C-section and keeping kids alive and stuff like that, we're going to see an increasing number of heritable diseases that previously would have been selected out of humanity.
4967000	4972000	So you really only get two choices before every human is just a walking ball of cancer.
4972000	4980000	Either you start selecting humans before they're born, or three choices, or you start completely editing and writing humans.
4980000	4985000	I think maybe there you can get into even more morality, or you start selecting humans after they're born.
4985000	4996000	Or I guess you can just enter this future where everyone's like this walking cancer golem of all of these things that previously would have been selected out, but our medical technology.
4996000	5006000	I think that the most ethical choice there long term is probably to make these selections before, you know, the cells really begin to replicate.
5006000	5024000	In your eyes, is there anything different ethically between rolling the dice of which sperm is going to get there first with which egg at which particular time during the years bunch of cycles and selecting.
5024000	5031000	Let's say that you were able to do a selection somehow that didn't involve discarding eggs because that would be a difference.
5031000	5047000	As far as you're concerned, is there anything different about parents going out of their way to choose the kind of life traits person that is going to come out as opposed to just saying we roll the dice when it happens, it happens.
5047000	5051000	And with the combination that happens is what the child is going to get.
5052000	5054000	Well, I mean, we as a society have been doing this for a while.
5054000	5065000	I mean, if you consider that sort of thing, you know, eugenics, then not allowing brothers and sisters to marry as eugenics, because the reason presumably we have those losses that leads to negative genetic outcomes.
5065000	5071000	Again, I just go back to I say that reproductive choice should always be at the level of the family.
5071000	5078000	And as soon as the state or an outside force says that a family can make these genetic choices and can't make these genetic choices.
5078000	5090000	That is the core of what eugenics is because you are saying people born of these genetic choices are somehow genetically morbid or or or like some sort of a monstrosity.
5090000	5091000	And then what do you do?
5091000	5092000	What they're a second class citizen?
5092000	5093000	I don't know.
5093000	5102000	I just don't think there's any way where you can begin to police families, genetic choices that doesn't turn into the the most evil of eugenics.
5102000	5112000	Do you think that there's an ethical difference between selecting embryos and going in there and actually manipulating genes and tinkering with stuff directly?
5112000	5115000	Yeah, I think in a lot of people's mind, there is a difference.
5115000	5119000	But I think that again, this should be a cultural choice.
5119000	5123000	I think that every parent should have the choice to to make the gene.
5123000	5128000	It's always funny when people they say, oh, he and his wife think that we're they're like genetically superior.
5128000	5130000	I'm like, we're the ones editing our genes.
5130000	5134000	Like we think we are the least genetically superior of anyone.
5134000	5138000	We are editing our genes through the hoops to try and make them as viable as possible.
5138000	5139000	Yeah, exactly.
5139000	5145000	So here's one final thing, you know, to tie the two things that we've spoken about today together.
5145000	5152000	A lot of people are told about the miracle that is IVF.
5152000	5161000	There are some concerns, I think that maybe women and men are overly reliant on it to believe that it can extend the fertility window out essentially indefinitely.
5161000	5164000	IVG, which may actually end up doing this.
5164000	5166000	Maybe we'll we'll see.
5166000	5167000	I'm a fan.
5167000	5169000	You want to talk about what IVG is?
5169000	5170000	Fuck it.
5170000	5172000	Tell everybody what IVG is and tell them it.
5172000	5176000	Tell them it in a very accessible way because Johnny taught me it and I don't I couldn't recite it.
5176000	5179000	So teach it as if you're teaching it to a golden retriever.
5179000	5186000	IVG basically means that you can create eggs and sperm from any human cell.
5186000	5190000	So it means that two gay people could have a kid that's biologically theirs.
5190000	5198000	But it also means you can do fancier things like you could have a poly couple of like 13 people and they could have a kid that is biologically out of theirs.
5198000	5202000	It basically allows you to I mean in the simplest form is just egg and sperm from anyone.
5202000	5208000	But this is really cool because it means, you know, if you're older, you know, you can have kids that are that are healthier.
5208000	5211000	And a lot of people are having kids when they're older.
5211000	5217000	But then, you know, you combine this with artificial wombs who were close on that technology to that completely.
5217000	5226000	Like when we're talking about cultural changes and technological and cultural solutions to technological and cultural problems, a lot of them are going to look like IVG.
5226000	5228000	A lot of them are going to look like artificial wombs.
5228000	5236000	What we may find is one of the solutions to the current collapsing birth rates is like gay triads or something like that, right?
5236000	5239000	Or poly cities.
5239000	5247000	Or like, I'm not saying that these things will work, you know, but if any of these sorts of cultural groups want to survive into the future,
5247000	5253000	they're going to have to find ways to make themselves raising kids and keeping their culture alive work.
5253000	5263000	And so I'm very excited to see how these technologies expand options for people and expand the diversity of cultures that are possible.
5263000	5275000	Because there's many more creative people than me out there who might find even more exciting ways to raise families and increase the cultural diversity of our species.
5275000	5277000	Just going back to the conversation about IVF.
5277000	5282000	For the people that haven't been through it or don't know somebody that has been through it, what's the experience like?
5282000	5283000	It's painful.
5283000	5284000	You should ask my wife.
5284000	5287000	I've seen these shots right into the butt.
5287000	5288000	I don't know how she handles it.
5288000	5289000	And she does this as a routine.
5289000	5290000	We have a kid a year.
5290000	5292000	She wants to keep doing this for like 10 years.
5292000	5300000	I don't, she is a tough, like, um, but it is painful.
5300000	5304000	This woman was a woman who worked through her first pregnancy.
5304000	5305000	She went to the hospital.
5305000	5309000	She was taking sales calls while she was having contractions.
5309000	5311000	Back to work was in five days.
5311000	5315000	The level of pain she felt when getting egg extractions and stuff like that was higher.
5315000	5317000	We're not higher than pregnancy, but I mean, it was hard.
5317000	5320000	She is not somebody who complains about pain.
5320000	5322000	She doesn't complain about the shots, but the egg extractions, they really hurt.
5322000	5326000	And I know that because she wouldn't, she wouldn't mess around with that stuff.
5326000	5328000	So what I can say is it's a, it's a painful process.
5328000	5336000	But if you see kids as like your mandate in life for me, not having kids is the equivalent of suicide or something like that.
5336000	5339000	Um, it's just not an option for me.
5339000	5343000	Um, and I, I'm glad that my wife, you know, I love if you had her on sometime.
5343000	5346000	She's a, she's a weird woman, um, but really fun.
5346000	5348000	Um, she's seeing similar to I do.
5348000	5350000	And so it's just not even something we would consider.
5350000	5352000	We're going to do everything we can.
5352000	5356000	And we tried to conceive naturally for like five years and it just wasn't in the cards.
5356000	5361000	And I think increasingly what families are going to realize is, uh, it's really hard to get pregnant these days.
5361000	5363000	Humans are becoming infertile as a species.
5363000	5365000	We're becoming infertile.
5365000	5370000	And you're, and when you look at things like artificial wombs, they may be one of our only shots.
5370000	5375000	Uh, because when we hear, when I hear women who have these complicated pregnancy, when I hear stillbirths,
5375000	5381000	oh my God, if your wife has carried a kid or you've carried a kid, when you think of a baby dying in that last trimester
5381000	5385000	and you know that with stuff like artificial wombs, we can lower the probability of that,
5385000	5390000	it just breaks your heart and you would want to do anything you can to accelerate the pace of this technology.
5390000	5394000	Malcolm Collins, ladies and gentlemen, dude, I, I find all of this,
5394000	5399000	I find all of this discussion a combination of harrowing, inspiring and interesting.
5399000	5405000	Uh, so for the people who want to find out more about the stuff that you do and keep up to date with your work, where should they go?
5405000	5411000	So, uh, our book series, The Pragment to Sky Theory, The Pragment to Sky to Craft and Religion is the most relevant to this conversation.
5411000	5414000	It's on Amazon, it's for 99 cents, the ebook.
5414000	5417000	Um, Twitter account, Simone H. Collins.
5417000	5420000	Um, or just, you know, search Simone and Malcolm Collins on Twitter.
5420000	5422000	We have a joint account because I hate using Twitter.
5422000	5426000	Um, and we're recently starting up our YouTube and podcast.
5426000	5433000	Um, uh, we just uploaded the first episode of starting it back up today, which is, uh, Simone and Malcolm Collins based camp.
