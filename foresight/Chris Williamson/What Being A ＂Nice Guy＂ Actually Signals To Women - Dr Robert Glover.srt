1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,880
What's wrong with being a nice guy? What's wrong with being a nice guy? That's that's a good question

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,940
You know when I put out a book called no more. Mr. Nice guy

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,920
I'm sure a lot of people picked it up that wait a minute

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,040
There's already enough not nice guys out there why somebody write a book teaching men how to be not nice

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,320
but

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,480
The problem with being a nice guy just a quick elevator pitch is that a nice guy is a guy who?

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,960
Inaccurately internalized the belief system every young age. I'm not okay just as I am

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:33,440
So he's trying to do two things very unconsciously usually one has become what he thinks

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,080
Everybody else wants him to be so he'll be liked and loved and get his needs met and get laid hopefully

10
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,720
regularly and hide anything about himself that might get a negative reaction from people

11
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,840
Hiding his needs his wants and sexuality so while he's trying to get laid. He's hiding his sexuality

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,800
so a core problem with nice guy syndrome is nice guys tend to be un

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,320
Unauthentic

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:04,040
There there there's not a real them there. They're trying to become something hide something and

15
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,000
That tends to make them fairly dishonest untrustworthy

16
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,280
Frustrated resentful passive aggressive

17
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,840
A whole list of traits that can go along and and mainly it prevents and I'm a recovering nice guy

18
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,240
So I'm not speaking down to anybody, you know

19
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,560
It keeps us from just being ourselves living up for our full potential

20
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,560
Having what we want in life having a good time and so just a lot of baggage comes along with it

21
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:37,400
What are the component parts of being a nice guy? What are the traits that they embody or project?

22
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,840
Worry what you'll recognize most often and what listeners may recognize in themselves

23
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,560
Core tendencies often people pleasing

24
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:52,800
Seeking external validation and and for men usually that seeking validation from women even even gay guys

25
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,360
I find tend to do it even if they don't plan on having sex with the women they

26
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,320
We can talk more about this, but we're

27
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:08,080
We've learned from birth to please women. So there's that people pleasing that external validation

28
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,280
I'm

29
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:16,880
Failing to live up to one's full potential a basic court is honesty, you know thinking, you know, I'm a good guy

30
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:22,680
I'm pretty honest. I always laugh when men tell me they're pretty honest. I say that's actually a contradiction of terms

31
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,560
You're honest or you're not

32
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,800
And

33
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,760
And just you know for most nice guys, there's just a certain dull

34
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,120
Depression that they live with just thinking, you know, I should be happy. I should be getting what I want

35
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,240
I should be getting love. I should I should but I'm not and I don't know why not and

36
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:55,120
So there's there's a lot of characteristics, but the core piece you'll see the most often is that people pleasing seeking of external validation

37
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,400
Who is the

38
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,160
Prototypical nice guy avatar like just describe him for me

39
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,200
He's you know

40
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,480
He's just just that guy that's you know walking through life trying to make everybody happy

41
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,600
Try not to do anything wrong. Don't want to fuck anything up doesn't want to piss anybody off

42
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,320
Goes along to get along, you know, we've heard that, you know, happy wife happy life

43
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,320
If I just make everybody happy

44
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,360
Everything's good. I have a course that I've taught for a number of years called nice guys don't finish last

45
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,760
They rot in middle management. So he's good

46
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:40,680
But you know, he doesn't excel he doesn't stand out because standing out is actually really scary for nice guys

47
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,480
It's too much attention. It's too much expectation

48
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,560
So, you know, when I started working with nice guys 30 years ago

49
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,600
Most of the men I worked with, you know, probably were around my age. I was in my early 30s at that time and

50
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,320
So there's a lot of baby

51
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:05,600
Baby boom generation guys, you know, they they were trying to be different than their fathers the World War two, you know, man

52
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:13,080
They were in that protest generation against Vietnam growing their hair out getting in touch with their feminine side

53
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,000
And so a lot of the men I worked with, you know, kind of grew up in that era

54
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,600
But I've been doing this for a while. And so, you know, my son's 38 for example

55
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,120
So, you know, I worked with Millennials Millennials men younger than that and what's funny is

56
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,480
Whereas my generation a lot of the men

57
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:36,880
Kind of attribute part of their nice guy stuff to well, my dad wasn't there or you know, my parents divorced

58
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,920
Oh, you know, he worked all the time or he's an alcoholic

59
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:47,240
Nowadays I hear a lot of men say, oh, my dad was a nice guy and and about all he taught me about life was don't piss off your mother

60
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,480
And and because he was walking around eggshells trying not to piss off my mother

61
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:57,440
So, you know, I've seen that whole range all the way from the guys that were reacting to, you know, the

62
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,760
asshole

63
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:08,960
Patriarchal father to now the guys that were raised by nice guys and they don't know any other way of being

64
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:15,120
It's like one generation had the tyrant and the other generation had the compliant

65
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,480
That's a good way to put it. That's nice. Yeah, the tyrant the compliant

66
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,560
Yeah, it was but here's the interesting thing, right?

67
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,360
And it's so fascinating that you had one generation that was

68
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,040
Rebelling in their niceness

69
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,320
Even if that niceness isn't that nice. Yeah, and then another generation

70
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,120
That was following in their niceness. So there seems to be a particular

71
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,160
stickiness to niceness if

72
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:47,680
Tyrants that are emotionally unavailable and not nice are able to create nice guys and

73
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,320
nice

74
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,320
Fathers are also big trouble

75
00:05:53,800 --> 00:06:01,680
What's why is it so prevalent? What is what is this pull? Are we as men are we inculcating or absorbing something from the world?

76
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,560
Is this the way that we were raised by mom and dad is the

77
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,000
What's the gen what's the origin? What's the genesis the seed of this?

78
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:15,040
That's a good question, of course and this course what every nice guy wants. Well, how do I get to be this way?

79
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,280
You know who cursed me with this. Yeah

80
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:24,480
I I quickly learned when I started working with nice guys again 30 years ago that there is no one

81
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:31,080
You know one size fit all how you how you got to be a nice guy. I thought there was it first. I thought they're all like me, you know

82
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:38,440
Disconnected from their father in some significant way, you know significantly raised by their mother trying to please their mom and

83
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,960
And I thought well that that explains it all but it didn't and

84
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,560
There's so many pieces that go into a lot of men I work with that identifies being nice guys

85
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,600
I think part of it's their temperament part of it's just they're easy going, you know

86
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:03,080
My my mother would often say in adulthood to women. I was dating. Oh Bobby never did like conflict and I'm thinking

87
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,560
Thanks mom, you know what are you telling these women be nice to my son?

88
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,000
Don't be mean to him, but I'm also thinking who does like conflict, you know

89
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,640
I do tend to marry women who like to fight but I for me

90
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:21,200
It's kind of like, you know, I can't can't can't you know instead of us you doing something that starts a fight

91
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,360
I say to them can't I just yell at you a little bit you cry and then I hold you in that really what you know

92
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,240
This is all about anyway, and my wife always say no, it doesn't countless. You're really mad at me

93
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,440
So I don't like conflict in particular. So that's my temperament

94
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,240
Disposition that many of the nice guys will have the raw materials of someone that's a little bit

95
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,520
Yeah, part of my nature

96
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:49,800
But but that's just kind of one category of nice guy the other one that that I bumped into I call often those

97
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,200
I'm so good nice guy. He's the guy that just always did everything right no matter what, you know

98
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:59,240
But the other side I talk about you know one mr. Nice guy is what I called. I'm so bad nice guy

99
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,880
This is the one that you know, maybe start rebelling at an early age

100
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,440
Maybe at 80 HD undiagnosed, you know, he's always impulsive getting in trouble

101
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,200
You know not following through getting yelled at getting punished starts doing drugs and alcohol at 14

102
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,000
You know drops out of school and then maybe at some point as a come to jesus moment

103
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,200
Religion military gets married as a kid

104
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:27,520
Death in the family. He goes I got I got to quit, you know self-destructing. I got a I got to be nicer

105
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,240
So there's that kind of nice guy as well. So it's a different temperament than the than the other

106
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:38,880
One of the pieces, you know, there's so many pieces that go into this but to answer your question, how do we

107
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,440
What's the stickiness part?

108
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:49,920
Again, I think a real core piece that I see with so many nice guys is this attempt to please women and

109
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,920
I I was talking to somebody the other day it makes perfect sense because if you think about it

110
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:02,560
We're all born to a woman our earliest caregiver. It is not mom. It's probably some other woman

111
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:08,160
So from the time we're born our very survival our sustenance our okayness

112
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,400
Depends on a woman and probably us getting along with that woman. That's probably a good thing, right?

113
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:21,920
And so that's really normal that the our first experiences are how to how to negotiate a relationship with a woman to make that

114
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,200
Big powerful holds our our life in her hands

115
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,840
Person how to make sure that's okay

116
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:34,400
And I don't know about in the uk but when I was growing up in Seattle. I had one male teacher

117
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:43,200
Before I got to junior high there's four times more female fighter pilots in the us air force by percentage

118
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,520
Then there are male kindergarten teachers

119
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,240
There you go. You've done your research so so I had one teacher

120
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,760
So that means just to learn how to get from second to third grade not only had to learn my reading writing and arithmetic

121
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,640
How to please a woman. Okay, all of that's fine. There's there's nothing inherently wrong with that

122
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,520
I think that's actually probably the way it's always been

123
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,600
But historically I mean if we go back even two or three generations

124
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,600
But if you go through most of human history

125
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Out of about age 12

126
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,960
The men came into the boys life took him

127
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:21,280
You know from the women took him out had a masculine initiation taught him how to get comfortable being uncomfortable

128
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,800
How to face his fear how to live in the scary world of the masculine

129
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:30,880
And therefore and spent most of his time from them on out with men in the masculine

130
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:36,240
And and so he got he moved through that what do I have to do to please a woman?

131
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,400
So I think that's a really normal thing that to try to please women

132
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,360
The survival for for every young boy

133
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,760
But what was missing is there's no initiation to teach them

134
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,240
How to how to go face their fears in the scary world with the masculine and quit seeking the approval and validation of women

135
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:01,040
Because there's this really interesting paradox that I took me years to find out and you know a lot of men I work with takes

136
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,200
You know, it's a big surprise

137
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,600
is all

138
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,720
Pursuing women and trying to please them doesn't make them interested in you. It doesn't make them like you

139
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,680
It doesn't make them want to have sex with you. No, it actually doesn't

140
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:20,240
Actually not trying to please women tends to make a guy more interesting to women in general

141
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,920
That's a big paradox for a lot of the men I work with and it was for me

142
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,280
You mean I mean all this

143
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:31,600
Me listening and talk about their problems me trying to be different than the jerks they complain about me repressing my sexuality

144
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,000
So it's not like I just want that one thing from them

145
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,640
Oh, you know all that doesn't make them interested in me. No, it doesn't actually

146
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,440
But they do seem to be drawn and attracted to the guy who's comfortable in his own skin

147
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,600
Living a life, you know on his terms connected with men

148
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,840
Putting a big dent in the universe that is really attractive

149
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,160
But there's no note. How do I get this woman's approval involved in that whole mix?

150
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,560
What are the covert contracts? Oh, I'm glad yes that

151
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,800
That's um, that's my favorite part. I'm no more mr. Nice guy and I know

152
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,480
Many men read it say robert. That is the biggest takeaway

153
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:15,680
The covert contracts are unspoken often unconscious agreements that the nice guy has

154
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,360
With everything that's not him with the world with god with women, you know, which is how things work

155
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,280
and

156
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:29,920
In the book I I I'm a little bit general, but I've broken it down to three specific covert contracts that nice guys have

157
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:36,880
They're all if then uh, if I do this then this will happen. They they all are basically manipulative

158
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,720
They all have strings attached and often the nice guy isn't aware of them and nobody else is either

159
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,040
So covert contract number one

160
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,280
If I'm a good guy, I will be liked and loved and get my and and

161
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,680
Going back to and the women I'm trying to impress will want to be with me and have sex with me

162
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,760
So if I'm good, I'll be liked and loved

163
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,120
Number two if I meet everybody else's needs without them having to ask

164
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,120
Then they will meet my needs without me having to ask

165
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,800
now

166
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,200
Unfortunately, nobody else knows this contract exists

167
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,080
So they don't know they're supposed to be reading our minds and figure out what we want like we're trying to do for them

168
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:21,520
Another core problem with this is that nice guys are actually really terrible receivers. We're not good at letting people do force

169
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:26,560
We're not good at giving to ourselves. So that's covert contract number two covert contract number three

170
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,160
Is if I do everything right, then I will have a smooth problem free world

171
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:37,840
So it's kind of a peter panish kind of thing, you know, I I do everything right? I'm a good guy

172
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,920
but unfortunately

173
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,440
We're the player the referee the scorekeeper and we got the big scoreboard. I've done everything right

174
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,560
How come this stuff still isn't going the way it's supposed to go in my life

175
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,760
So nice guys are walking around these covert contracts and you ask, you know, what are

176
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,520
What what what's the core characteristic of a nice guy?

177
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,560
One of them is is that they're often really resentful

178
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,080
You know, they might say well, I'm kind of bugger. I'm kind of frustrating

179
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:10,720
But the really resentful not an arrangement because I've been doing this. I've been doing it right. I've been following the rules

180
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,520
I've been, you know, being the good guy. I've been meeting your needs. I've been, you know, following all the rules

181
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,920
You know, how come I'm wins at my turn

182
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,640
How come I'm not getting all the all the stuff that I thought I would and that leads to a lot of resentments

183
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,080
And that's one way I can tell I tell nice guys

184
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,240
They well, how do I know if I'm if I'm using covert contracts and I'll go

185
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:36,240
You'll know because you're walking around resentful and pissed off either because you didn't get back

186
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,880
In turn or you didn't get appreciated for for all that that you did

187
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:47,760
I heard somebody share a quote the other day that I really liked to me is another really nice way of putting covert contracts

188
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,720
And this I guess was from Neil Strauss and he says

189
00:14:51,120 --> 00:15:01,760
Un unspoken expectations expectations are premeditated resentment. Isn't that that that is what happens with covert contracts phenomenal by him? Yeah

190
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,960
that

191
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,360
So the frustration and the resentfulness

192
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,480
that's coming from

193
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,960
offering to the world something that you think should be

194
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,600
Universally liked you have that there is there's no way that anybody could be

195
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:27,280
Offended by what I'm doing. I'm following the rules. I'm offering the world lots whilst asking for nothing in return

196
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,800
and

197
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,040
The fact that not asking for something in return results and you getting nothing in return

198
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,680
Finding how that works. I don't know

199
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:41,920
But it's I suppose this as well plays into the dishonesty bit and it's so I understand

200
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,960
I would say that I'm I'm very much in nice guy category

201
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,560
Very much a people pleaser

202
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:53,040
My temperament is to be averse to conflict as well

203
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:58,160
I've made a dent in many ways, but it's been done

204
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,800
It's been done by weaving my way through avoiding

205
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,440
much of the the conflict

206
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,160
That that I would maybe need to

207
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,600
So I suppose I can be at least in some regards a

208
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:19,760
A paragon or like a a a role model for the successful nice guy in in many ways and me too

209
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,400
You know, again, I don't like conflict, but you know, I you know, I'm doing okay

210
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:31,280
There's something I always felt I always felt the fact that I wasn't like my go-to isn't typically

211
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,600
Aggression that's not what I lean into

212
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,200
Um

213
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:42,080
Despite the fact I've got a background of fighting and and doing other things and physical training and stuff like that

214
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,320
I always felt like it emasculated me

215
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,960
The fact that there was something more heroic

216
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:53,520
About being someone that was quick to anger, you know, there was something kind of typically masculine about that and I think I was

217
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:01,760
Not strong enough to say ashamed, but it felt it it didn't feel as

218
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,400
grand

219
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
to be someone who

220
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:11,920
Would be I know that there's an ability in you know being under control having your emotions under control

221
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,560
um, but there's also a degree of

222
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,040
Fragility, I think that you can sometimes feel with that also

223
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,400
Well, let me give a one way to maybe look at the model and see if it fits what you're saying

224
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,000
Is that when I was writing no more mr. Nice guy

225
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,600
I really focused a lot on shame being a core foundation of a nice guy syndrome that internalized belief

226
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,360
I'm not okay and

227
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:41,440
Inaccurately internalized belief from our earliest life experience a few weeks old few few months old

228
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,200
by the time I finished writing the book and it was you know

229
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,880
Getting ready to be published. I by that time. I'd really come to also see that anxiety plays

230
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:58,160
Maybe an equally significant role in nice guy syndrome. So where everything that nice guys are doing is trying to manage that sense of shame

231
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:03,120
I'm not okay. I'm unlovable. I'm defective and their anxiety states, you know, I might piss somebody off

232
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,720
I might get rejected. I might get hurt. I might lose. I might look foolish

233
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:13,040
so, you know, both of those states really play into it and one of the things I've come to see is is that

234
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,640
Whether we've got just just kind of break it down

235
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,640
whether we got kind of the asshole jerk over here that fighter that quick to fight guy

236
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:27,040
Or the wussy doormat, you know, the nice guy over here. That's the avoidant and kind of doesn't like the conflict

237
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,040
I think they're they're both on the the same continuum

238
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:36,880
I think they are both in a fight flight freeze mode of managing their interstates of anxiety

239
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,920
The nice guy is in the flight freeze bond sometimes added to that list

240
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,440
And what we call the jerk is in the fight mode now

241
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,520
They're both still just trying to manipulate

242
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:55,120
People and situations outside of them because they're anxious the nice guy does it by being nice and avoidant and not upsetting anybody

243
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,800
And you know waiting for it to blow over you all that kind of whereas, you know

244
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:06,400
The guy the other end of the spectrum is it's just he just quick to react with aggression to manage the people and situations around him

245
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,040
So so he doesn't feel afraid and anxious

246
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,000
And so men will often, you know, they'll read my book or you know, they'll hear some of my information

247
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,680
They'll say robert I get that being a nice guy isn't working and I don't want to be that

248
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,240
But I don't want to be the asshole either and you know, where where's that middle ground and I go

249
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,280
I actually don't know where the tipping point is between two

250
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,160
Dysfunctional extremes. It doesn't exist, right?

251
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,000
What what we're actually talking about is is going to a different plane a different level

252
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,080
Where we actually learn to soothe ourselves

253
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,880
We're actually learned to be assertive where we actually learn to have boundaries

254
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,600
Or we actually learn to be differentiated and ask ourselves

255
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:45,200
What do I want and follow through on it where there's you know, there's a whole different plane of behavior versus just

256
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,680
What do I do to not feel anxious here?

257
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:54,720
But again, the nice guy and the jerk probably neither one is aware that they're trying to manage their anxiety states

258
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,120
And and it isn't until you actually

259
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,480
Get told that maybe that's what you're doing you go. Oh, wow

260
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,800
I never thought about that before and then then you actually can feel your anxiety

261
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,000
Rather than trying to just manage it to where it doesn't, you know

262
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,520
Make you feel so anxious. Is it a desire to feel safe then to feel reassured?

263
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,920
Yeah, I think, you know

264
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,920
safety's at the core because

265
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,120
Well, I took child development 101 back in grad school

266
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,800
I think the very first thing they told us one of the few things maybe I remembered

267
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,640
Was that for every child abandonment equals death?

268
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,480
So children come into the world inherently vulnerable

269
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,480
All right, there's no one to take care of us

270
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:40,800
It takes humans longer to mature into self-sufficiency than any other animal on the planet

271
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,960
You know our grandfathers, maybe that was about 12 or 14, you know

272
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:51,040
My age was more, you know, considered 18 21 22 that was like 35 for a young man to you know

273
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,680
Mature to be able to take care of himself. That's a joke. Um, but but it's true

274
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:02,480
So we're dependent completely dependent and if somebody doesn't take care of us we die

275
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,840
So if we get abandoned neglected, uh, we die

276
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,840
So I know for me like when my wife, you know, I'm

277
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,960
My wife Lupita and I've been married for seven years now

278
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,800
Mexican woman I met here in Mexico and um, she gets a look on her face and like

279
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:24,480
I'll go into, you know, this motive. I gotta I gotta fix it. She's upset. She's angry. I gotta make it better

280
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,800
And you know, I've been working on this stuff for 30 years

281
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,080
So you know

282
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,600
Not like I don't know

283
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,360
You know what's happening and I'll just watch myself have this anxiety state

284
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,840
That I gotta I gotta talk her down through over get her back to good, you know, make her happy again

285
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:43,280
And I'm thinking why am I worried about with this short little Mexican woman? Why what look she has on her face?

286
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,720
I love her of course

287
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:50,560
But why why is that triggering such depth of anxiety and really is a you really sat with and worked with it

288
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:55,760
It triggers a really old emotional state that does feel like I'm gonna die

289
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,160
If this doesn't get better right now

290
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,000
I'm gonna die and I don't actually have that thought in my head

291
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,840
But my reaction to it feels that intense. That's the embodied

292
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,920
Sensation if you ask the embodied the nervous system my emotional operating system. Yeah, yeah

293
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,720
I wonder

294
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,880
Stepping outside of relationships for a second

295
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,680
Relationships with anybody including friendships

296
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,960
One of the patterns that I've noticed

297
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,640
Especially amongst some of my friends that are nice guys or recovering nice guys

298
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,280
Is a desire to

299
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,640
Do things right?

300
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,480
Oh, of course to like a task in and of itself

301
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,840
Uh, I would guess that nice guys are probably more orderly

302
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,240
than the normal person sources will be stacked in the in the right way

303
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,800
You know, mustn't have a very room

304
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,280
Because again, you'd think that you'd think that okay. I got to do it right

305
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,160
I got to do orderly, but you know, I've got my camera angled or you can't see what's over on the sides

306
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,480
All right, it's it's it's a mess. It is it's not terrible, but

307
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,680
It it is messier on the sides than it is behind me. Okay. And so

308
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,880
Again, a lot of the nice guys I work with

309
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,680
They may have perfectionistic expectations of themselves

310
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:18,080
Um, and some worked really hard to to to meet them and then they're they're in a state of anxiety all the time

311
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:23,440
But others I know they go, you know, I haven't made my bed in years. You know, I don't pick up after myself

312
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,480
I can't remember the last time I I checked my bank account balance

313
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,480
So you'd think there would be that but but ironically

314
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,400
Um, there's not and here's a piece that

315
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,560
That it may sound an odd on on the surface of it

316
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,000
But when I talk with nice guys about their fears and their anxieties

317
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,440
I think one of the biggest anxiety or fear state that the typical nice guy might have

318
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:53,760
Isn't so much a fear of failure fear of foolishness fear of looking foolish fear of loss fear of making a mistake

319
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,000
Is fear of success?

320
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:03,520
Because what happens if I do get it right? What happens if I rise up to a level of success and then, you know

321
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:08,560
There's things that can happen all of a sudden the bar gets raised the expectations are higher

322
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:12,240
I'm in a brighter spotlight. I might get attacked. I'm more visible

323
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,760
um

324
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,360
There's so many I'll lose control over my time all of these

325
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,880
Built in anxieties of what happens if I'm too successful

326
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,680
So again, a lot of times the nice guys will

327
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,280
unconsciously

328
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,280
I don't really like the word self sabotage

329
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,120
But they'll get in their own way of living up to to their full potential

330
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:37,360
And keeping things messy around you is actually a pretty good way to you know, you know, not live up your full potential

331
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,120
Not checking your bank account every now and then, you know, I'll bite you on the ass sooner or later

332
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,760
isn't it isn't interesting that the

333
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,680
almost universality of

334
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,920
high ability

335
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,800
of

336
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,840
this honest

337
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,000
Do you want to uh, do you need to sort the dog?

338
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,360
This is a regular occurrence I can see

339
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:05,440
She's usually in the room with me and and she's a deer. I this is my bringing her in she can chill

340
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:10,320
Yeah, the problem is she's upset because somebody's out front and I'm the only one home

341
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,560
And I don't want to go deal with whoever might be up

342
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,960
Okay, it could just be my wife getting home with my daughter from school. Okay. Okay. So um

343
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,680
Yeah, she's just being a good girl. Let me know exactly. Yeah, poppy. There's somebody out there. There's somebody out there

344
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:31,280
Let's go. Let's go and it may have been she just saw a cat. So, you know, I I don't know so be it um

345
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,680
She walked away. So

346
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:40,560
She's bored of you now. Yeah, it's interesting that there is uh, there's almost universality of

347
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:47,200
Uh, not having healthy boundaries. Yeah of being dishonest of being manipulative although you don't think that you are you're

348
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,360
Overly pliable in a way that means that you change yourself to get the outcome that you want from people

349
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:59,680
But it seems at least based on what you've said here that there there appears to be a boundary at least typically

350
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,400
among the nice guys where this doesn't

351
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,760
outside of relationships friendships

352
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,680
family

353
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:11,040
Dating etc. This doesn't spread out into a

354
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,360
Uh

355
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:20,480
Overbearing desire for for orderliness and and sort of perfectionism in all areas of life

356
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,640
You know with regards to an obsession about getting it right about being

357
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,920
It can't I just what I'm trying to say is it's not universal

358
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,920
Whereas the other stuff is yeah, but it's what it shows or at least what it says to me is that there's something

359
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,080
It it's obvious that ground zero for this stuff is relationships

360
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:48,240
You know that that would have been my first thought as well because it is for me and it is for many nice guys

361
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:52,960
But you know what I've I've seen guys who are total nice guys

362
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,520
In relationship and they get on the job and they kick ass

363
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,960
You know that they're highly successful at work. I've known other people that it showed up

364
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:09,840
You know at work where they're a told nice guy and going along to getting along and never really stepping up or never launching

365
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:15,360
You know that that business and but at home, you know, their their wife would say he's not a nice guy

366
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,520
He's nice to everybody else, but he's not nice to me

367
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:23,280
So it can be interesting and and that would again when I started working with nice guys

368
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,160
I just assume there's a one piece fits all

369
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,160
And and there's really not now there are those certain commonalities

370
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,760
But I think partly because we're also dealing with temperament

371
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,400
That for example, maybe you and I had very different life experiences

372
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,360
Maybe we have some similarities of temperament some differences different life experiences

373
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:50,320
We're not going to turn out just the same. We may still have those tendencies of you know seeking approval avoiding conflict

374
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:56,720
You know kind of a uh, oh, you know, I'm so good. Why doesn't everybody like me and everybody try to be just like me?

375
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,160
um

376
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,080
There might be some similarities

377
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,640
But we might be very different and still relate to this. Yes. I'm a nice guy

378
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:09,200
Understood. What about hidden behavior? They keep things hidden from themselves. They keep

379
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,320
Why is that so common?

380
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:17,120
Why is it common because you know those two things when you know when we first started you asked me, you know

381
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:22,960
What what is the nice guy and basically and and I said he's the guy trying to get everybody's approval and validation

382
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,840
You know holding your finger ups. It's which way is a wind blowing

383
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:33,680
But the other piece is that hiding things about ourselves, you know hiding anything for example that might get that look on my wife's face

384
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,920
You know, oh, she got that look. I must have done something. I better not do that again

385
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:43,600
You know again that began at a very very early age when getting that look from somebody important to us

386
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,920
might result in getting slapped getting smacked getting neglected getting yelled at getting shaken whatever

387
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,160
so

388
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:58,720
Nice guys. This is part of that. I got to hide whatever there is about me that tends to create these negative reactions around me

389
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:05,600
But often there's another piece not again not universal but often for nice guys in their family system

390
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,640
Somebody has been defined as the needy person the most important person

391
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,920
Could be dad could be mom could be a sibling and their needs were more important

392
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:22,240
All the attention and focus went on, you know making sure dad never got pissed off making sure mom didn't go on a tirade

393
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,920
Making sure, you know, brother doesn't you know, whatever, you know, he's sick or he's he's out of control

394
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,080
So often for nice guys, we try to become this needless

395
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,800
Wantless never rock the boat never be a moment's problem kind of person

396
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,400
so

397
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,120
What we interpret is us having needs

398
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:46,960
Draws too much attention and and you know my their needs are more important than mine and so

399
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,720
Nice guys, we're

400
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,000
Again trying to avoid that negative reaction the two things we often most hide

401
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:59,680
Are our needs and wants and our sexuality the sexuality that's kind of easy to put a finger on

402
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:04,320
You know, we live in a culture that we're bombarded with sexual stimuli everywhere you go

403
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:11,360
But still there's still that you know that religious message that sex is bad evil save it for the one you love shame

404
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:16,400
Yeah, just a whole shame wrapped around sexuality you'd think that would have gone away by now

405
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:22,240
But but it's not it's as strong as ever. So for the the the the very young nice guy

406
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,920
When kind of kind of back up a little bit back to the to the child development 101 stuff again

407
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,560
Every child when they experience discomfort of any kind, you know, the hungry and they don't get fed

408
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,040
They're they're they wet their diaper. They mess in their diaper. They don't get changed or cold. They don't get help

409
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,000
Then you know, they have stomach ache. They don't get burped whatever

410
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,760
Whenever a child experiences discomfort their children are narcissistic by nature

411
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,840
Emotionally, they assume this is me. I I'm the cause of this

412
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,440
I did something wrong. I'm bad

413
00:30:53,440 --> 00:31:00,560
They don't think it because the thinking brain isn't online at this early age the emotional brain fight flight free survival brain is

414
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:08,320
And so a child will try to do two things in a very primitive way a non-thinking non-rational purely emotional way

415
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,440
They will try to medicate the feeling states they're having

416
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,880
Suck their thumb eat cry sleep

417
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,880
Whatever to try to not feel bad right now

418
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,120
And again in a very pre very primitive pre verbal

419
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,040
kind of way

420
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:30,880
Try to do try to not do whatever that was it caused the uncomfortable states or do something different

421
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,760
And so that begins at a really early age and so the child is

422
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:42,880
These these the shame is is inaccurately internalized at an emotional level. I must have done something wrong

423
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,120
That's why this is happening. So

424
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,400
I got to figure you how to do that different or not do that hide

425
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,040
And so all of this comes

426
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:57,920
So early as part of an emotional language an emotional operating system. It's not in words. It's not in picture memory

427
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,720
And it's it's primitive

428
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:06,880
So here we are trying to figure out how not to have these uncomfortable experiences and prevent them from happening again

429
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,280
And one of the best things our primitive brain came up with is hide

430
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,200
Hide, you know, whatever that I have needs all I have needs

431
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:20,480
I I get I'm I'm hungry when I have needs I get slapped. Oh, their needs are more important than mine

432
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,000
so

433
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,680
Just hiding is part of that because we think it must be about me

434
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:30,080
That's causing these painful negative experiences to be happening to us

435
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:35,200
Does this mean the nice guys often have coping strategies? Maybe they'll overeat

436
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:40,720
maybe they'll be compulsive with social media use or porn or video games or

437
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,240
Substances or whatever

438
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,000
The thing about that model. I just gave you that child development model

439
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,720
Every human does that every human

440
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:57,840
We all just pick usually again based on temperament and maybe just life experiences and birth order

441
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,480
We all pick what are we going to do? How are we going to try to manage this?

442
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,240
And I sucked my thumb times in kindergarten. I think maybe I was trying to

443
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,680
Deal with some uncomfortable self-soothing self-soothing exactly trying to manage some anxiety there

444
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,720
So that's what I did now

445
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:21,280
We we go through childhood then we hit adolescence and now we really want people's approval and want to fit in and be noticed

446
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,880
and have attention

447
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,880
All of this really, you know, it gets

448
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,520
Fueled with with with our hormones and need for attention

449
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,040
Where you know, they really get solidified and we pretty much carry these routines into adulthood

450
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,760
So yeah, trying to be perfect might be one

451
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:43,600
You know trying not to be perfect because my brother was perfect and I couldn't you know compete with him

452
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,320
So I'll be the opposite. I'll I'll make the mess

453
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:52,400
Yeah, when I eat I sure do feel better when I spend all my day and night playing video games

454
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:59,360
I I don't feel stressed when I'm oh, isn't porn amazing. I didn't know that this existed. Look how I feel

455
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,280
Um, oh, you know, if I get straight A's look, I I finally get some validation

456
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:09,680
But I don't know if it's ever enough. I better keep, you know succeeding performing

457
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,520
You know, I better get into great amazing shapes so I can be valuable

458
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:19,760
Oh, I'll never get in good shape. So who cares? I'll just keep eating it can take so many different forms

459
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:25,040
And the only real logic to it is the the infant logic

460
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,920
That you and I and everybody else had at a few weeks and a few months old

461
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:34,080
Why uh nice guys bad receivers

462
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:42,080
Because we think it makes us bad, you know, the the thing is is that

463
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:49,680
As I said, most of us is is most nice guys internalize this belief. Well, I because I have needs

464
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,880
That's why I I have these bad things that happen to me

465
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:58,880
If I don't have needs bad things won't happen and often again, they I could I could look around in my family

466
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:05,760
Oh, dad's needs are more important. Well, let's all make sure dad's okay. Oh now mom's unhappy. Let's all make sure mom's okay

467
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,880
My little brother was a general fuck up at pretty much everything. Oh, okay

468
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,440
You know, we got to make sure little brother's okay because he's gonna fuck up and I kind of like oh

469
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,400
If I don't have needs if I just kind of do everything right, I'll be the golden child

470
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:26,640
I'll get some validation. You know, I I won't get noticed too much and getting trouble and and so again

471
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,640
That was my story. It's not every nice guy story

472
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,640
but

473
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:37,520
There's some fundamental piece in there that if if is visible if people know I have needs like that makes me vulnerable

474
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,240
It puts me at risk. It gets people control over me. I'll owe people something

475
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:50,000
So in my own personal work, one of the earliest things I had to start doing was was making me a priority where I

476
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,760
Put where I did for me. I I'd do for everybody else

477
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,920
But I wouldn't make me a priority and you know, I'd make sure you know, my wife and kids they all went to the dentist

478
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:03,920
I wouldn't go to the dentist. Oh, they you know, if I saw something on sale, I'd buy it for them

479
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,960
I wouldn't buy it for me. So I had to start taking good care of me

480
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:11,600
The next step that that kind of came with that but came a little bit later for me

481
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:19,200
Was actually beginning to surround myself with people who wanted to help me meet my needs and then actually letting them

482
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:26,480
That was really anxiety producing to let people do things for me and I had to consciously just go

483
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:31,440
Okay, I'm it's as simple as like I'll take the garbage out

484
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,480
And you know, we got to take the garbage from the kitchen to the front gate

485
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,440
It's 20 feet got to unlock the gate put it out on the street

486
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,720
My if I'm taking the garbage at my wife will go you need help

487
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:46,160
Well, no, I don't I don't need any help to take a bag of garbage from the kitchen to the front

488
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,800
And and so I my gut response always say no, but then I realize well

489
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,280
I don't need any help, but she wants to be with me. She wants to accompany me

490
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,440
She doesn't want to think I'm doing all the work. Well, she's not she's very hard worker

491
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,760
I go. Yeah. Yeah, come help me. Do I really need the help? No

492
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,480
But it was actually it took me a while. I'm still learning that way

493
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,760
You know, she's not really thinking I need help taking the garbage out

494
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,760
She just wants to come take the garbage out with me just to walk to the street with me and back

495
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:21,120
You know, that's that's okay. Well, who might have say no to that? That's the thing about being a bad receiver

496
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,680
It robs people of the

497
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,360
enjoyment

498
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:28,720
Of helping you you've you've stole my words when I'm

499
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:34,720
When I got I got divorced in my late 40s after 25 years of marriage to two different women

500
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,640
And again when I started dating and started meeting nice girls, you know

501
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,000
Who wanted to do anything for me wouldn't ever say what they wanted wouldn't make it to say

502
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:47,360
I thought oh, I'd I'd empathy for my two ex-wives what I put them through with being an ice guy

503
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:51,920
But I remember I was dating one woman and I met her because she sold me shoes at Nordstrom

504
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:56,800
And she so she worked in retail fashion sales and her one time she came over to my apartment

505
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,880
And I'd done some laundry left it on my couch

506
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,480
She started folding my laundry and I said you you don't have to do that

507
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,160
She goes no, I like doing it and and she goes and I'm good at it

508
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,360
And you know, so she folds on my laundry puts a little stack on the end of my bed

509
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,800
And she goes but I won't put it away for you. I said I'm not putting it away either

510
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:18,320
I'm leaving it out there to remind me somebody loves me, you know that that somebody wanted to do something nice for me

511
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,880
After that I started leaving my clean laundry on the couch

512
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,600
So she could have the joy

513
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,480
Of coming over and because it gave her pleasure

514
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,880
Now who am I to rob her of that pleasure?

515
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:36,720
And I need to work on it because how am I going to receive great things in this world?

516
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,040
If I'm not good at receiving if I can't if I can't let somebody fold my laundry

517
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:46,080
How am I going to receive the blessings of wealth of fame opportunity of adventure?

518
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:52,560
So it's it's a very conscious practice. It was for me. So how do I let people give and let them have the pleasure of doing it?

519
00:38:53,920 --> 00:39:00,240
So the solution is not being a bad guy because a lot of people and you could try

520
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,600
so, you know

521
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:08,960
Nice guys finish last the bad guy gets the girl, you know, women will

522
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:15,360
Sleep with the alpha but marry the beta, you know, pick your meme or cliche of choice

523
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,320
But they're all out there sure to come up with

524
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:23,280
And it seems let me I'm going to try and interpret what I think the

525
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,400
Your philosophy is and let me know if I get it right

526
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,600
I think

527
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,640
The downsides of being a nice guy

528
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:38,480
Although subtle and often completely opaque to the nice guys themselves. Yes

529
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,360
are

530
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,280
kind of

531
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,280
evident given

532
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,800
Can become evident given enough crowd sourcing of sense making so people and community

533
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,960
Come up with memes and characters in tv shows and stuff like that

534
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,880
right

535
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:03,920
The solution that the low resolution solution that then gets proposed is if x x being

536
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,520
nice guy

537
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,520
Is bad and doesn't get what you want

538
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,880
Then opposite of x y which is bad guy must be good

539
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,280
so the prevalence of

540
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,480
In you know, uh treat her like you don't like her

541
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,200
Like why women love chads like that kind of more

542
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,800
Um

543
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:31,840
Lethario approach to attracting women and and and getting what you want in life and sort of you know being ruthless and stuff

544
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,320
Is that a

545
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,600
an erroneous solution to the problem of nice kindness

546
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,320
it's

547
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:45,200
A core problem with what you just proposed is it is equally inauthentic

548
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:50,480
As as the other and it's equally attached to some external outcome

549
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,960
By trying to figure out how to do it right

550
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:57,520
Right. How about I just do this right again, then I'll get the women to approve of me

551
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:02,400
We're still in the same boat. We're just looking for a different right way of doing it now

552
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:10,960
As simple as this sounds, you know, like when I do like interviews with like a female coach that that maybe works with men

553
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,800
and um

554
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:18,800
And I say something that you know generalization like the feminine meaning all things feminine, you know women but

555
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,080
Dogs cats babies opportunity money weather whatever

556
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:27,280
I'll say is highly attracted to a man who's comfortable in his own skin

557
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,000
knows where he's going

558
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,080
And looks like he's having a good time going there

559
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,800
And the women, you know coaches interviewers podcasters on the call always go

560
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,600
Oh, yes

561
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:46,320
Okay, they're they're reacting kind of their nervous system is reacting to that thing. I didn't say the guy's an asshole

562
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,760
I didn't say he treats women bad. I didn't say doesn't give a fuck about

563
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,440
He he's he's centered in his own body

564
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,320
He's he's differentiated. He's asking himself. What do I want? What's important to me?

565
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:04,880
Following through on that, you know, not leaving the message behind not trying to be perfect not seeking anybody's approval

566
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,280
He's on mission. He's on purpose

567
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:11,920
And in my experience the feminine is highly attracted to that you don't have to work

568
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,560
At at getting the feminine to be attracted now

569
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,520
Are you always going to have feminine approval? I told someone the other day

570
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:23,040
This has never come out of my mouth before but I said actually there is no standard of feminine approval

571
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:28,800
But the feminine is not about standards. It's just about whatever is moving masculine at standards

572
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,640
You you go into the masculine world

573
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:35,280
You know when you've lived up to the standard when you've hit the ball out of the park when you've scored a touchdown

574
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:41,120
When you made ace when you you know made x amount of money the masculine doing standards are clear

575
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:44,480
We can go into that world and go I've achieved. I've made it

576
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,880
We have it. We have the stats rigorous. It's orderly

577
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,600
Requires something of you. There's discipline

578
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,560
The fat there is no such thing as feminine approval

579
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:57,840
I mean ask any guy even a woman who approved of them dearly in one moment

580
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:01,840
I'll ask them. Have you ever had experiences where the very next moment she was

581
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,440
unapproving of you and nothing about you had changed you had even

582
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:11,280
And guys all go yeah, isn't that the way it always works? Yeah, you know one minute when I was dating

583
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:16,080
I had women tell me robert. You're the most amazing man. I'm so glad I met you. I'm so grateful

584
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,800
I'm so happy and then never hear from them again

585
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:25,200
Or say robert, you know after two weeks, you know, I'm taking a break from dating or I'm giving my ex another try

586
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,800
And I'm going what just happened. That's the world of the feminine

587
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,840
It doesn't it isn't nailed down and orderly. So we we have to quit seeking

588
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,560
feminine approval

589
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,520
One of my certified coaches wrote a book that that I really like but there's a line in there

590
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,160
It said that a man does not mature

591
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,440
Until he quit seeking the love of a woman

592
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:55,600
As long as we're seeking love that's a feminine trait long as we're seeking to get that approval that love that validation from a woman

593
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,560
We're in a loop that there's no escape from

594
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:05,280
But when we when we can self validate when we're on purpose when we're living life on our terms

595
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:10,720
All of a sudden that makes us very attractive to the feminine. It will come to us. That's that's my experience

596
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,320
It will come

597
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:16,160
Now as soon as you turn and go, oh is here. How do I keep it? How do I make no no no?

598
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:21,120
We just blew it. All of a sudden now they're going to get that look on their face again. Like I go what I do wrong

599
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,280
so

600
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,800
If we take the how do I get the women's approval out of the equation

601
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,800
You're more likely to get it does that mean you just don't give a fuck don't care whatever

602
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,760
That's not what I'm again. It's not black and white

603
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:38,000
We we men want to make it black and white. It must be this or it must be that no

604
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,240
It's this this is

605
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:46,400
Another level that we rise to that lets us put a dent in the universe that lets us

606
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:53,840
Live with purpose and passion that lets us connect deeply with others that lets us be vulnerable and courageous

607
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,480
That actually invites the love

608
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,560
Into our life that that we desire rather than seeking it

609
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,760
Well, ultimately I was watching this um

610
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:10,480
Video from a lander botan from the school of life. Do you know that guy? British philosopher phenomenal insight

611
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:15,120
You were the second person who mentioned him in the last two or three days

612
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,240
I always pay attention when so whenever I hear someone's name like, you know

613
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,880
Whenever I heard you need to get on chris williamson's show when I heard that three times in the same week

614
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,600
You know, I thought wait a minute that name sounds familiar. Oh

615
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,600
Oh

616
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:33,120
I'm on he's on my calendar. What do you what do you know? It's um, so I use a

617
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:37,760
I'll just say what you're referring to he wrote an op-ed article in the new york times

618
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,200
Maybe 10 years ago

619
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:45,840
He's now the title was why you will marry the wrong wrong person. Yeah, I love I love that article. I copied it

620
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:52,080
It's it's just class. He's outstanding. Uh, I've he is on my mount rushmore of of of guests

621
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:54,880
He was very formative for me. Um, one of the reasons that

622
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:58,800
I'm gonna go on a tangent about why I love a lander botan

623
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,760
one of the reasons that I really love him is he's so

624
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,880
Softly spoken and he's so

625
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,080
embodied in the nuance of

626
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:14,960
Being fallible of how our emotions run the show. He's not posture. He's unbelievably smart

627
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:21,680
you know, he's very very well versed in renaissance art and history and poetry and and sculpture and and and

628
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,720
All all this stuff, but there's no posturing

629
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:30,640
From his left brain. Yeah, there's none of this sort of over rationality. He he

630
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:38,880
Accepts with complete face value the fact that we can be self contradictory and embarrassing and and all the rest of it

631
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,840
But anyway, he has he has this line in a video that I was watching recently

632
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,880
Where he talks about

633
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:51,360
A person whose greatest achievement would be after their death people would say they never made a fuss

634
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,920
Oh, they didn't make a fuss. They didn't you know, they didn't cause any ripples

635
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,800
They didn't make any waves and he's talking about largely

636
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:06,480
An equivalent of the nice guy this person who's you know overly pliable who's concerned about upsetting others who's doing all of this stuff

637
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:11,920
Anna, I just it really it really sort of struck home like oh my god, like that's the

638
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:18,560
That's the inheritance and the legacy which is waiting for you and ultimately

639
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,120
You can make it to the end of your life having

640
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:27,760
Either made all of the messes in the world or made zero messes at all depending on whether you go bad guy mode or nice guy mode

641
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:31,120
But

642
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:34,240
Like your legacy as you look back on your life is going to be one of

643
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,960
You playing a persona

644
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:41,120
You're never going to really be able to connect to any of the things that you do

645
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,760
people

646
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,760
accomplishments

647
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,760
praise compliments adoration

648
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,360
money

649
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,360
Because it wasn't you

650
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,160
that earned that

651
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,160
You didn't earn your money

652
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,200
The role that you're playing earned the money

653
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:05,280
The role that you're playing got the marriage the role that you're playing got the relationship or the job raise or

654
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:09,440
Or created the family or the the billion dollar company. It wasn't you

655
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,080
wasn't you

656
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,720
That's kind of messes with your head doesn't it

657
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,440
It's scary

658
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:23,600
You know when you were describing and I can't pronounce his name pronounce his name a land of botan. Oh, yeah, that's beautiful

659
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:27,200
When you are describing him i'm sitting there thinking i'm a straight guy

660
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,720
And that guy sounds sexy as hell the way you were destroyed. He's

661
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:36,320
I mean, he's got the classic philosophers build, but so be it. So be it

662
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,600
Here's something else. So here's something else that i've had in in my mind

663
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:40,720
um

664
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:44,640
Since looking at your work and kind of i've spent a lot of time over the last three years

665
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:48,240
Looking at evolutionary psychology mating dynamics so on and so forth

666
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,880
We don't see especially from women at the moment

667
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,520
Many conversations online

668
00:48:55,680 --> 00:49:00,560
About nice guys about guys being too nice about guys being too pliable

669
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:06,080
A lot of the conversations skews toward guys being too toxic guys being too immature

670
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,160
But it's immature it it tends to be in a in a toxic manner

671
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,880
It's sort of the use and discard the use and abuse

672
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,000
The the very sort of transient transactional nature

673
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,920
What is the reason do you think?

674
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:24,960
That there isn't as much popularity if if and i don't disagree

675
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:29,760
I think that a huge problem will be the pliability and and dishonesty and niceness of men

676
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:32,960
Is it just less

677
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:36,640
Tweetable to to have that as the reason that you can't find met

678
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,160
I've got all of these men that keep bending over backward and keep doing things to me

679
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:45,040
Is it that it's kind of publicly unpopular for women to call that out because it seems like they're being ungrateful

680
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,280
What do you what do you think it is? Well?

681
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:53,280
Because i'm not in a woman's head. I I can't and because i'm not on social media

682
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,000
I also but I I do know what you're talking about

683
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,920
Of course, there are memes that that that run

684
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,400
and I

685
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,160
I do you know because I get a google uh notice every time

686
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:12,400
Nice guy, you know pops up somewhere. I I do see what when it does pop up it usually pops up and

687
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,880
write wing republican writing

688
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:17,120
um most often but

689
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,440
When women do

690
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,760
Write their blog articles about nice guys

691
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:28,640
It is most often how nice guys aren't nice of how they use basically the covert contracts of oh

692
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:33,040
I'm going to listen you talk about your problems. I'm going to pay your car payment this month. I'm going to

693
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:39,200
Pretend like I care about you and then when they you know ask the woman out or wanted to have sex

694
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,480
They goes no I never thought of you that way you're a friend, you know

695
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:48,400
And then the and then the guy of course that all that resentfulness that passive aggressive that rage comes out

696
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:54,080
And so, you know that meme does show up, but but it still ends up being toxic masculinity

697
00:50:55,360 --> 00:51:00,960
Here is my thought and it sounds like you've looked a lot at this and you might even have a better perspective than me

698
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,920
My thought is that

699
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:10,240
You know, I grew up during whatever the wave of the angry feminism was in the 60s and 70s

700
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,000
I don't know if that's first wave second wave

701
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:17,520
But you know every man's a rapist and erections a sign of aggression and you know that already bought in my mother

702
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:21,120
You know my mother's generation with the first I think true feminists

703
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:26,480
She raised my my sister to not need a man raised her boys to be different from their father

704
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,520
You know that was kind of the beginning of that movement

705
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,400
and um

706
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,480
So

707
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:38,000
From that I grew up with I don't be like those bad men the women are complaining about so

708
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:42,240
So kind of the toxic masculinity meme has been around for a while

709
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:47,040
It just didn't have social media and now mainstream media mainstream me

710
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:52,640
I I can't even listen to like npr anymore because it's kind of like it's just gone so much to like

711
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:57,600
Let's just run fluff articles, you know fluff stories and stuff like that. I agreed. Um

712
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,240
I think

713
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,800
There had to be a pendulum swing

714
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:11,600
You know most of that's directed at patriarchy, you know now you just say patriarchy and like we all understand exactly what that means

715
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:18,080
It's evil, right? But but patriarchy was also providing protect, you know, there was also

716
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,960
Positives a part of it and was there an ownership mentality? Yeah

717
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:27,680
Did that lead to colonialism and you know abuses towards women and children? Yeah

718
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,360
Uh racism. Yeah, so yeah all of that

719
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:36,960
Well, you know when we make a social change we tend to throw the baby out with the bathwater

720
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:44,000
So, yeah, this was rail against this big idea of patriarchy toxic masculinity, you know

721
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:49,200
You know mansplaining man spreading everything that men do is bad kind of stuff

722
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,040
I

723
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:57,920
Think maybe it had to go to an extreme and and I think most sociologists that look at big shifts in society

724
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,720
Say when you have an oppressed people

725
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:06,240
Um the down drawing it almost has to become like a revolution. It has to be at the extremes

726
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:12,720
It doesn't have to be a correction. Yeah, it's not like a Gandhi that just you know, let's subtly create the shift

727
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,400
Um, so I think there has to be that over correction

728
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:23,280
And and you know, so we went through the hashtag me too where you know, men were you know, you know, accused tried

729
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:29,840
You know prosecuted and you know in the media lost jobs lost status purely because some woman said oh

730
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:34,480
I want to join the me too crowd, you know, and yeah, there was a lot of abuses that were being addressed

731
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,520
Should they've been addressed through social media?

732
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,640
I don't know if that was you know, the most

733
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:45,200
Democratic way to do it, but it's how it got done and then you know, yeah

734
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:49,280
If you you know publish something that gets a lot of likes and a lot of

735
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:55,680
Follows and yeah other people are going to publish it. So yeah, it went to the incentives aligned to make it happen

736
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:02,560
Of course they do and social media is all about algorithms and you know the more something shows up the more you see of it

737
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,320
Uh, that's why I told one of the reasons I don't like social media

738
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,080
um

739
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,080
But I actually think

740
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,080
That we're actually making an adjustment

741
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,640
You know, I I I saw articles

742
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:19,840
Yeah, a couple years ago likening anything that had to do with men's work

743
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,120
To like the oh there goes the balloons

744
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,160
Jesus christ

745
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:30,000
I didn't think it was gonna work. How have you managed to make balloons come up on this?

746
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,560
I promise I promise. I'm magic. Stop doing it

747
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:39,120
I I wish I yeah, I can't quit moving my hands now. The thumb will probably go up. Maybe maybe confetti

748
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,160
All right. All right. Okay. So even just a couple years ago

749
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:48,800
I saw articles about linking the january 6th, you know riots, you know in washington dc

750
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:55,200
To anything having to do with men's work like conflating that that all came out of the men's movement

751
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,280
and I'm going

752
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:02,560
And this was in main is washington post random article like that, right? So it's mainstream media

753
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,160
I think actually

754
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:10,240
That I think maybe we've reached that far enough far extreme

755
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,320
And I think maybe it's starting

756
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:17,360
So we're all of a sudden that's losing this interest is it seems to you know, oh, okay

757
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:22,240
There's another meme about toxic masculinity. Oh, there's another meme about andrew tape

758
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:27,040
There's another, you know, blah blah blah and people do get bored and now maybe in this because I'm

759
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,880
In the middle of men's work. It's what I've done for years

760
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:36,480
And I'm I'm in you know a men's program myself. I built a men's program. I believe in it

761
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:45,040
I I really do think we're moving to a better space that as men become more conscious

762
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:49,360
Um of the things that I think, you know, they teach they're valuable

763
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,280
You know being honest being transparent making their needs of priority

764
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:58,560
Surrounding themselves with people on how to get their needs met living with purpose living with passion, you know

765
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:04,080
Being generous making the world a better place being open-hearted being loving, you know quality good qualities

766
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,200
That I think

767
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,320
Is changing the world is shifting the dynamic

768
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:17,920
Women I think will begin to go that that's actually really attractive. That's that's sexy. That's better. I like that

769
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:19,600
and um

770
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:24,160
And I think there'll still be a few ones hanging on to but I let's all still stay mad at men

771
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:29,920
Let's you know, let's still and after a while, you know, one of the things that really was a big shock to me

772
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,480
I was probably in my 40s

773
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:38,080
When I was I was talking to you know a feminist and I mentioned somebody who identified as a feminist a woman

774
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:42,480
Maybe on an airplane and and I said, well, here's the feminism I grew up with

775
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:46,400
And she said, oh, you mean that every man's a rapist you you like

776
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,640
Believed all that I go

777
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:53,680
Well, it sure was because that was just a few angry pissed off women that got a lot of attention

778
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:59,040
I go that's all it was not all women felt that way. She goes no and they still don't I go

779
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:05,360
That's actually good to know that maybe all that noise that you know gets a lot of likes and follows

780
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,840
Maybe that doesn't represent

781
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:14,000
But even the majority of women there was a really wonderful term that I heard last year called the tyranny of the minority

782
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:18,400
And it happens. Yeah, I think that that explains it

783
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:24,080
Another way of putting it is the slowest dumb shit on the freeway is going to control how fast everybody can go

784
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:27,920
Very good. Yes. Yes. We're controlled by the extremes and the idiots

785
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,240
um

786
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:35,680
It's interesting to think about why that might be the case. I think that you've probably you're probably not far wrong that

787
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,840
It's still so popular to

788
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,200
fit men into the

789
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,040
impressive

790
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,640
tyrannical

791
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:49,680
patriarchal overbearing dominating controlling role

792
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:51,280
that

793
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:57,280
If women were to if a woman was to post online something which is more more honest, perhaps which would be

794
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:02,000
Um, I keep going out for men who are overly pliable and because they're so pliable

795
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:05,440
I'm concerned that they're not being honest with me

796
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:10,000
What does that sound like? Well, it sounds like a call for men to be less pliable

797
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:14,800
Which is not far away from men to be more aggressive more controlling

798
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:20,240
Writing a book that's called no more. Mr. Nice guy. Why would someone write a book teaching men to be not nice?

799
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,160
We do we do

800
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:25,760
Live in a black and white world and again media social media

801
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:30,400
Loves the black and white. It doesn't like nuance subtlety

802
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:37,120
That's the dangerous the real n word of 2024 is nuance. That's the real one that you shouldn't be saying

803
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,240
All right, so getting into getting into relationships, which are obviously

804
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,200
I think ground zero for a lot of this stuff

805
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:47,520
You know, you can kind of hide things away from yourself when it's on your own

806
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,920
And you're in and out of work and all the rest of it

807
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,920
If you know, everybody is emotionally connected with the work and everybody's emotionally connected with how

808
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,400
organized their source cupboard is

809
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:04,240
Relationships real ground zero. What do nice guys not understand about how female attraction works?

810
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:12,240
Well, most of us are believing what our mothers told us, you know, uh, if they told us anything

811
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:14,880
Which is to be nice to girls with my mother said be a gentleman

812
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:19,120
Okay, make sense. You know be a gentleman and I am

813
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:24,880
Uh, I'm a gentleman, but a woman taught me this one. Uh, I always open the door for women

814
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:30,160
I tell them wait for me. I'll open your door. Now if you really break it down, that's me being dominant

815
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,600
You know, I tell them what to do wait for me. I'm gonna open your door

816
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:39,120
And of the of the several hundred women who I've told to do wait for me. I'll open your door

817
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:43,520
Only one has pushed back against it and she pushed back for a while

818
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:47,520
Then all of a sudden she quit and kind of decided she actually really liked

819
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:51,920
Actually what she did is she jumped my bones in a public place and a very I said

820
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:57,380
We need to take this somewhere else after the while she's been pushing back against my dominance

821
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:00,080
so

822
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:04,080
For there to be attraction there has to be a polarity

823
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:10,080
And polarity involves dominance and submission. I know those are evil terrible words, you know

824
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:16,080
Because we think about dominant men, you know making women be submissive. You're in you're in a safe space here

825
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,880
I'm not I'm not sweating it

826
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:21,600
But yeah, it is okay. It is going out on the internet, which is fine

827
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:28,080
You know and what's happened is a polarity has just switched where the females have become dominant the dominant players

828
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:32,400
And the guys have become the submissive players and then the the women go

829
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:36,160
How come I can't find a guy that turns me on and the guys you're going?

830
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:40,720
How come I can't seem to turn women on? Well, it's it's is reversed a polarity

831
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:46,160
You you can't have polarity. That's attraction without dominance and submission

832
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:49,840
And the more subtle it is the more subtle the attraction is the more

833
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:55,360
Latent it is tends to be the more intensity attraction is we've probably all experienced that in one way or another

834
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:59,040
And I tell people you can't have sex without dominance and submission

835
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,800
Otherwise, there's two bodies lying next to each other waiting for something to happen

836
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:06,480
You know you gotta have a yeah, you know fight you have a top and bottom

837
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,880
You have a picture and catcher right there's got to be

838
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:15,280
A polarity now the beauty is that polarity can you can flip it around?

839
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:19,440
You know back and forth and I think in very conscious relationships

840
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:23,120
That that happens beautifully my wife's very strong

841
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:27,200
She grew up eight out of ten kids in poverty in guadalajara, mexico

842
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:32,000
alcoholic father got beat on by family members beat on by neighbors

843
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:36,400
You know abused by family members abused by priests, you know, she's she's been through

844
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:43,360
You know, she goes to the gym two hours a day. She can out squat me easily. She's done my thigh. I don't I don't piss her off

845
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:46,320
Um, you know, she can get shit done

846
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:50,960
I grew up in a middle class white bread neighborhood of seattle washington

847
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:57,040
Surrounded by bowing engineer families, you know, it's just you know, I never had to fight for anything

848
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,520
Okay, so she's tough

849
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:02,320
But she doesn't she's always told me I love it when you tell me no

850
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:06,960
She goes, I don't I don't want to be in charge. I don't want you to always ask me what what you know

851
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:10,160
What do you want to do? She she likes it when I make we're walking to a restaurant

852
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:14,400
And you know, though here in mexico and they'll say no they'll say should I the last curtain?

853
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,760
Should I get the waiter say should I give him a menu in english? She goes no

854
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,200
He lives in mexico give him one in spanish and I'll say yeah

855
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:23,760
Give my wife and kids the menu in english

856
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,640
And then they hand her a menu and she goes no, he's my boss

857
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:29,760
He'll order for me and they always laugh about that and I say yeah

858
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:33,920
I get to be the boss when she says I can't you know, so we got those the whole stick down

859
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:39,680
But the truth is she is strong. She's powerful. She can get shit done. She can kick ass

860
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,720
But she doesn't want to be in that mode all the time

861
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:47,200
She wants to to be led. She wants to submit. She wants to open

862
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:52,160
She wants to be done too in blissful kinds of ways. Well, that's my job

863
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:58,960
Right. So and even though I'm kind of more that I'm I'm go along to get along. I you know, I'm yeah

864
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:02,080
This or that either one's okay with me. I'm kind of more that way

865
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,720
She doesn't like it when I'm that way

866
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:11,520
So for her she's happiest when I will play the default lead the default decision maker

867
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:15,120
But she likes it best when I said here's what I was thinking. What do you think?

868
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,280
You know, I don't just say what do you think, you know, what do you want?

869
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:23,680
I'll say, you know, I was thinking a white with a little bit of tint of gray in it

870
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:24,800
What do you think?

871
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:29,200
You know, she wants me to to to lead that and then she'll feel the polarity and then she'll tell me

872
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:32,000
What she thinks or wants and then you just say you decide

873
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:35,120
Okay, let's go. Let's go. Let's go pick out the paint

874
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:41,200
Um, am I being abusive to her by being dominant? No, I've heard so many women tell me

875
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:48,160
When the guy leaves it all up to them to comply it the women feel burdened by that most are in their masculine

876
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:52,480
dominant role all day long in their work in their career

877
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:59,760
Raising children even mothering is a masculine dominant state to be in you're taking care of kids needs

878
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:04,160
That's not feminine. I don't them want to have to take care of your partner after that

879
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:08,080
Yeah, then then when the guy says oh, I don't get you want to have sex tonight

880
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:13,200
Would you or what do you want for and it's just one more thing that they got to check off there to do is

881
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,280
They don't want that

882
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:21,120
Now am I making a generalization? Yeah. Is it fluid? Yeah. Is it nuanced? Yeah

883
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:26,720
Is it okay? The guy's always got to be the dominant the woman's but no that's not what I'm saying

884
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:32,640
But for for men when I start talking about them consciously setting the tone and leading in relationship

885
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,200
When I say that to a nice guy

886
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:41,760
The response he usually he'll pondering okay, dr. Glover what I hear you say when you say take control

887
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:47,120
I go no no you did not hear me say the word take control. I did not say it

888
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:53,600
I don't believe in it. I'm talking about you lead you set the tone you state what you want where you want to go

889
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:57,680
What you want to eat and and and give her a chance to follow like on the dance floor

890
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:59,920
She can't follow where you don't lead

891
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Give her that and then

892
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,640
Be open to a discussion be open to her taking the you know setting the tone and leading

893
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:11,200
But it's not about but guys nice guys will say when you know when you said take control

894
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:15,120
Is more nuanced than that but again

895
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:18,400
So that that that's my job is helping guys

896
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:22,240
Apply the the nuance that that word of 2024

897
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:25,360
What is the role of emotional tension?

898
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,480
Oh, you've done some research

899
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:33,280
Yeah, that's a cute little wink of the high that just it was just flirting with you. I'm just

900
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:36,480
It's reflexive. I'm just trying to flirt with you. Yeah

901
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:44,080
I know the girls like it. Probably the boys do too. I I live in a very gay community. So, you know

902
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,560
I know how it is

903
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:51,920
Okay, so the role of emotional tension. There we go. We just had emotional tension going on right there. Yep

904
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:56,800
I'm gonna I'm gonna make a generalization that doesn't apply to everybody

905
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:02,160
But it does seem to apply to a lot and that's the generalized statement is

906
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:06,720
Is that in general for women to experience attraction?

907
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:09,120
Say towards a man

908
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:16,400
Arousal and to stay attached to that man over time. She has to experience some kind of emotional tension

909
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:23,200
She's got to feel something the butterflies and this the that the drama that does he love me doesn't love me

910
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:28,400
And we men can kind of understand that a little bit. We kind of like the tension we feel of go

911
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:33,120
Feel it's nice, you know like her boobs whatever, you know, that creates attention for us

912
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:38,000
But in general men don't like emotional tension, especially in relationship

913
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:44,560
If you even think about, you know, our sporting events where we do get our tension and clocks on them

914
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:49,360
You know, we know it's going to end at this time. That's why baseball is falling out of favor

915
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:53,840
That's why they put a clock on baseball. They put the they put the pitch clock last year

916
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:59,440
Yeah, you know, how many times you can throw it at first, you know, because oh, we got to have it on a clock

917
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:03,040
You know, so um, so men's tension is on the clock

918
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:09,200
Oh, yeah, I I know this, you know, this this adventure flick i'm watching in the hero

919
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:14,240
This is happening. I know he's gonna get out of it and it's gonna be done in 35 minutes, you know, it's done

920
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:17,680
We're done. Shoot go home kick back into nothingness, right?

921
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:21,760
The feminine never gets tired of tension the feminine if it

922
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:25,600
If it isn't feeling tension is bored. It will create tension

923
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:29,120
And so that's what's hard for men to understand, you know

924
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:32,880
We think to be nice to women will make them be attracted to us

925
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:37,840
But nice creates absolutely no attention no tension really for anybody

926
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:43,200
Men or women, but we think well, that's what mom told me to do. Go be go go be nice to them

927
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:48,800
It's what that's what I in junior high all the women were complaining about those jerks who create attention for them

928
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:55,200
And so I listened to her complain about the jerk since she kept going back to the jerk even after you know, I'm such a nice guy

929
01:07:56,560 --> 01:08:01,680
So in general women need that emotional tension watch it. They create it within themselves

930
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:06,000
Um and and we guys if we have any kind of tension between us

931
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:11,120
We'll just have it out. Maybe we'll punch each other and then we'll be done. We'll go have a beer. It's all good, you know

932
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:15,760
We don't need to keep going back into that tension state to have a bond have a connection

933
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:18,560
Well, we'll go do something together. We may go compete

934
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:22,880
We may go bring our a game and leave it all on the field, but then we walk off arm and arm

935
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:27,520
So it's just the the the difference between that masculine and feminine

936
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:32,640
So the hardest part for men to understand is that the women need that tension. So even when

937
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:35,760
I say wait for me. I'll open your door

938
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:40,160
And now I create a little bit of dominance and she waits for me. That's tension

939
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:44,480
All right, it's just a little bit. It's a little subtle, you know, even like, you know

940
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:47,920
Say hey, put the menu down. I'll order for us tonight

941
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:52,720
There's tension and I'm not being nice. It's actually creating something. What's he gonna order for?

942
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:56,560
Is he gonna pick something? I like do I trust him? Is it gonna be an adventure?

943
01:08:56,800 --> 01:09:01,440
You know, I tell guys and you know and you know guys will think it's game playing

944
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:06,720
And it kind of can look like that and but the the real thing is it's actually just is how do we get more conscious?

945
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,960
So I'll tell a guy for example, you know

946
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:15,440
If a woman sends you a message text message or calls you and if you reply right away or you pick up the phone and answer

947
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:18,480
How much tension will the woman experience through that?

948
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:23,360
Well, well, none we've relieved it as soon as we answered the phone or tension went away

949
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:25,760
But what if you didn't answer it?

950
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,720
What if you called her back in 30 seconds 45 seconds

951
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:32,560
An hour and she goes, where were you? Why didn't you answer?

952
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:35,360
And what if you didn't give her an answer to that?

953
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:41,280
And she's going why didn't he answer? What was he doing now? Here's the thing because those guys

954
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:46,400
Ten if we do have emotional tension, we like what I call positive emotional tension

955
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:49,680
You know, it it feels good to us where you're at

956
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:57,440
For the for women they don't care. Is it positive emotional tension? Is it is it pet or is it net negative emotional tension?

957
01:09:57,680 --> 01:09:59,920
They don't care emotional tension is emotional tension

958
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:05,280
And so, you know, it means, you know, them starting a fight, you know them doing something knows

959
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:08,560
They know it's going to piss us off. It's kind of like they don't care

960
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,400
They got our attention

961
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:13,440
And and that's all that mattered. They got our attention and there's tension

962
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:19,120
And and even the thing of guys like listening to women talk about the problems. I tell guys there's a an

963
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,040
inverse

964
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:26,160
negative relationship between the amount of time a man spends listening to a woman talk about her problems

965
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,880
And the likelihood he's going to get laid what you mean

966
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,400
It means that if you say and listen to talk about her problems, you've actually relieved all of her tension

967
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:38,960
Tensions flowed completely out of because you know, she talked she talked she talked all the tension

968
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:42,640
Came away and what I tell guys is then you end up looking like

969
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:47,760
Her girlfriend with a penis and odds are she doesn't want to have sex with her girlfriend

970
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:51,760
So anything we do to relieve their tension

971
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:56,160
Actually works against us and robs them kind of like we talked about earlier

972
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:58,640
Are we going to rob them of the joy of doing for us?

973
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:05,600
Well, are we going to rob them of the emotional tension that they have to have to feel to feel something

974
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:08,160
To to want to engage

975
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:11,280
You had this fantastic example

976
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:14,480
of how emotional tension

977
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:18,400
is enjoyed differently by men and women by the

978
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:22,800
story arcs of romantic comedies and how men and women

979
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:26,960
Uh, experience experience that can you explain that?

980
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:32,080
Well, you mean like, you know, you you take your woman to watch titanic and she titanic

981
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:36,400
You know, she's already seen it eight times and she walks away with her panties wet thinking outcome

982
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:42,000
I can't have that and the guy the guy's checking his watch checking his phone his fort center on yet

983
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:48,000
How do I get out of here? I I thought what was particularly interesting was you you explaining and it really sort of hit home to me that

984
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:51,680
Uh, if you're a man who's watching a romantic comedy you see

985
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:53,120
um

986
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:56,400
regulation at the beginning everything is is fine

987
01:11:56,640 --> 01:12:00,000
Then you see dysregulation something happens and everything goes up in the air

988
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:02,080
Then you see regulation again or more like

989
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:09,200
Middle movie regulation whether the couple first starts to get together and you're like, oh, well, I mean that's it like let's go home

990
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:13,680
The movie's done. Yes done. Whereas what the woman then wants is this protracted

991
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:16,640
Oh, but the ex-girlfriend's back in the picture

992
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:19,920
But oh my god, he hasn't got his right visa and he's going to be deported

993
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:25,040
How are they going to keep the relationship going and it's just protracted and protracted and protracted and protracted and then

994
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:27,680
I don't I don't know what it's like to be a woman at the end of a rom-com

995
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:28,640
But it may be

996
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:33,600
Unsatisfying for there to be a conclusion. It's like what could we just let's roll it for another three hours

997
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:37,360
Let's just continue to extend this and that's maybe we're bollywood figured it out

998
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:40,960
Let's just do the wedding scene everybody's dancing to a real upbeat song

999
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:44,080
We know it's over but now they'll do a part two of it

1000
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,400
um

1001
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,400
and you know

1002
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:53,360
Women I've been in relationship with learned don't take me to a romantic comedy

1003
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:58,640
I'm sitting there going that is so fucking unrealistic. That doesn't happen in the real world

1004
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:05,280
How come every guy has a job he doesn't actually have to go to how come every woman's a fashion editor in every one of these

1005
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:11,600
Yeah, I know he loves dogs, but he lives in this new york loft and makes canoes. That's how he supports himself

1006
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:13,840
Come on. That's not real. Yes

1007
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:19,920
Yeah, you don't want to go to a romantic comedy with me because I live in the world of could that really be real

1008
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,720
Could that really happen? Do people really do that?

1009
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,880
No, you know, that's not how the real world works

1010
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:31,120
But it creates emotional tension and so that's really what it is all about

1011
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:37,840
It's not about reality the masculine wants to go resolve all the emotional tension to get us back into reality

1012
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:41,760
So yeah, I it's it's really hard for me to watch a romantic comedy

1013
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:47,360
Just twiddle my thumbs and just not not say anything. Oh, it's excruciating. So

1014
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,320
thinking about this

1015
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:52,320
Dynamic that we have this emotional tension

1016
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:56,800
this amount of of dominance and and uh direction

1017
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:00,800
Uh and and suggestion that comes from the man. Um

1018
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,520
There will be women listening and out there who

1019
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:10,880
Enjoy they're writing a blog article about us right now. It's fine. It's added to the list

1020
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,600
But there will be women listening who?

1021
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:19,120
Maybe a little conflicted or there will be men who imagine that the woman might be conflicted because you say well

1022
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:25,600
She wants she comes home. She's had a difficult day at the work because kelly that bitch in the cubicle next door

1023
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:28,720
Has done that thing again that pisses her off and the woman

1024
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:33,920
Wants to be able to vent. She also wants her man to listen to her

1025
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,320
and it's this odd duality of

1026
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:39,680
Not knowing what's best for us

1027
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:44,640
And of the things that we want not always being in our best interests and you

1028
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:51,120
Quoted the best onion article which is woman turns man into a partner. She doesn't want to be with

1029
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:56,800
I I got the article the headline alone is is enough right, you know

1030
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:02,080
And and again, this is this is the dance of relationship

1031
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:06,880
Wouldn't it be great if you know, we could just say guys just do it this way every woman's going to like it

1032
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,760
No, it doesn't work that way

1033
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:15,600
And but what what you said what was really true is that yeah, so for example

1034
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:20,240
You know the woman in your life's been in her masculine all day doing at work

1035
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:25,920
Putting up with asshole managers asshole customers asshole clients asshole core workers

1036
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:30,640
And now, you know, she comes home. There's one more asshole now is putting demands on her

1037
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:33,280
So for example

1038
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:39,120
Um, the woman that folded my clothes that I mentioned again, I met her at the mall as she sold me shoes

1039
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:44,960
And when after we started dating, um, one of the things where we really clicked is she liked baseball

1040
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:47,360
I like baseball

1041
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:50,160
Rangers fine. I could have been part of a threesome. It would have been great

1042
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,880
There we go. You're flirting again

1043
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:57,040
But but you lost to me as soon as you said Texas Rangers, you know

1044
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:03,360
Hey, those of us with the world series championship in the last year. Yeah, you're you're the we you're the homer

1045
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:08,720
Yeah, we we won the world series. Let me see the ring man. Show show me the ring. Okay, so, um

1046
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:14,880
She liked baseball so, you know, she'd get off work four or five o'clock in the afternoon

1047
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:19,280
I'd already have a bar stool staked out at the roost chris that was right next to you know, where she worked

1048
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,760
Couple baseball games are already on the screen at the bar

1049
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,200
They have this great half rice hamburger during happy hour

1050
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:32,800
She'd come in and she would just start, you know, I'd already have the wine ordered sitting there

1051
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:36,880
You know, the you know the appetizers that come and she's like this about her day

1052
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:40,720
Like that. She's been in her mask in all day. I would take out my phone

1053
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:47,680
Set it at five minutes and say you have my undivided attention for five minutes. Put the phone on the bar

1054
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:51,520
I would give her eye contact. I would face her

1055
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:54,000
I would listen

1056
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
undivided attention

1057
01:16:56,400 --> 01:17:02,480
She would run out of steam before five minutes was up because she's going I sit here complaining

1058
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:06,960
But there's a baseball game on and there's a glass of wine sitting here. What do I prefer?

1059
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:10,480
Before now if I didn't put her on the clock at five minutes

1060
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:15,200
It was a game it was me being dominant but in a loving playful if I didn't put her on the clock

1061
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:16,480
She might

1062
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:22,800
Be crabby all night long and she would not enjoy herself because one of the things I found is that for

1063
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:27,920
Somebody who identifies as feminine to be in their masculine all day

1064
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:31,360
Are often not good at getting themselves out of that masculine

1065
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:34,480
I got to go home and wash dishes and get the laundry done

1066
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:37,120
There's things we got to do before I got to get up and go to work tomorrow

1067
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:41,440
I'll sit down. I have a glass of wine. Tell me about your day. Let me rub your feet

1068
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:44,640
I'm a big fan of of in a sense

1069
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:51,440
Leading her back into her feminine out of that masculine rigid get shit done kind of state of mind

1070
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:55,840
And now all of a sudden she begins opening and she'll tell me your attention

1071
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,680
I might even say a woman taught me this. I'll say, you know what? I want to hear about your day

1072
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:01,680
But give me the guy version

1073
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:06,960
You know, and I've never had a woman ask me. What does that mean? I'll say you you want me to be your guy, right?

1074
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:10,880
Yeah, yeah, all right, then I need the guy version when you tell me about the day

1075
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:14,640
Please translate about how Kelly and the cubicle next to her, you know

1076
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:19,680
And I know why she does it because you just insecure and she's always wanting attention and she always takes it out of me

1077
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:21,840
Dear

1078
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:25,280
I love you. Give me the guy version. Kelly pissed me off today. Great

1079
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Now I understand why you had a bad day

1080
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:31,040
So, you know

1081
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:33,440
Get playful with it get playful with it

1082
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:39,920
There's definitely one of the common threads that I'm noticing through a lot of the dynamics is a degree of playfulness and

1083
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:43,600
It's my nature. So it is what I bring and

1084
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:48,240
You know, it's it's helping it's helping to it's helping to relieve the tension

1085
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:50,960
relieve the tension it's helping to relieve the

1086
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:52,880
seriousness

1087
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:56,080
Of everything that that it it gives more play

1088
01:18:56,640 --> 01:19:01,280
It gives like in the engineering term it gives more room within the system for things to breathe

1089
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:05,360
You make a suggestion, but it's not it's not done in too

1090
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:10,240
Rigid of a fashion. There's there's there's movement in there and it's done

1091
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:14,720
It's evident the reason that you're doing it and it's not in a mocking way. It's not in a passive aggressive way

1092
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:19,520
It's not in a condescending or patronizing way, but the reason that this I think

1093
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:25,120
Works is it shows. Hey, look like we're here to enjoy our time together

1094
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:27,600
we're here you're here to enjoy we're here to enjoy this and

1095
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:33,760
Whether it's someone's had something good happened. Someone's had something bad happened. Someone's sad. Someone's mad. Someone's whatever

1096
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:38,160
The appropriate amount of playfulness I can struggle to think of

1097
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:41,440
Really many situations in which it doesn't make it better

1098
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:44,640
Yeah, I

1099
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:50,880
And that doesn't mean getting silly and everything's a joke because again guys will kind of like oh, you mean make a joke about it

1100
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:52,960
and again

1101
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:54,960
teaching men

1102
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:56,960
to to be lighthearted

1103
01:19:57,200 --> 01:20:00,160
But that that that can be a pretty daunting task

1104
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:04,240
Yeah, um now what's funny though if you get men with men

1105
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:09,760
And and let them just kind of begin to let their hair down guys get silly with each other

1106
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:13,600
And you know and but we're I think we're afraid of showing that to women

1107
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,200
Oh, yeah, I won't I won't appear manly. I won't be you know

1108
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:20,960
It's a degree of there's a degree of competence. I think

1109
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:26,640
Uh, I certainly noticed this. Do you know who charlie hoop it is from charisma on command?

1110
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:32,880
He's got a very big charisma channel on youtube. It really really great guy very embodied ton of self work ton of men's work

1111
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,200
and

1112
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:36,400
he

1113
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:39,600
Helps mostly men but also women become more charismatic

1114
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:46,240
So he's he's learned the principles of confidence and charisma and um one of the best tools that he

1115
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:50,240
teaches is when people ask a question

1116
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:53,200
The best answer isn't always the right one

1117
01:20:54,160 --> 01:21:00,240
And you know he uses this example of um, how to overcome your discomfort around trying to be funny

1118
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:03,920
And he says if you walk out of the house and you're with people you walk out of a bar

1119
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:09,600
Or whatever and the weather is one extreme of either hot or cold make a joke about it being the opposite

1120
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:14,960
Yeah, and he was like it's the shittest joke. It is the worst. It's a pure dad joke

1121
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:20,560
But he said it'll get a chuckle out of people if you walk outside and it's freezing hot and you go dude

1122
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:22,560
Wish I'd brought some shorts today. This is great

1123
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:26,880
um like people have a little bit of a chuckle about but it really really

1124
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:30,640
Showed me and I have a friend george who's been on the show a lot

1125
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:34,800
He a lot of the time if you're playing kind of like a game of tennis

1126
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:40,560
So you're playing a game of tennis which involves a linear conversation. Here is a question. There is an answer

1127
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:43,600
Here is a question. There is an answer. Here's another answer. Here's another question

1128
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:48,240
And you played this back and forth. He regularly hits the ball sideways

1129
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:54,880
So he'll call back to a thing that happened a couple of weeks ago or he'll say, oh, you know

1130
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:59,200
I bet that such and such a famous person from the media would have done that or whatever like he'll

1131
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:05,280
Rip the conversation out like orthogonally from where it is and there's play in that

1132
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:10,880
He's not answering the question because he he has the comfort in himself to not need

1133
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:16,400
To get validation by being I am the person that always knows the answer

1134
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:22,160
I am the person that is always able to give the the correct conclusion that draws the line that puts the full stop

1135
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:23,760
And dots the eyes and crosses the t's

1136
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:26,880
I don't need to be that person and it's such a breath of fresh air

1137
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:31,680
Because you're having this conversation and and you're like, I'm excited. I don't know what's gonna and it

1138
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:36,560
Engenders that in you as well, but there's definitely like good boy energy

1139
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:39,520
a nice guy energy in

1140
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,520
I will answer the question properly. I will ensure that this

1141
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:50,400
Somebody's asked something of me and to deliver it. I shall and that removes the playfulness. Yeah, you know and

1142
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:55,680
When I work with guys around this again when I said when I learned to date in my 40s and 50s

1143
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:59,840
I you know, I was never good with women and if I got one I kept them way too long

1144
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:05,920
And I started getting successful, you know with dating and getting laid and guys said Robert teach us

1145
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:08,480
I'm not a dating guru

1146
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:13,840
But what you're talking about is it again for most of the men I worked with they get so afraid

1147
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:19,280
I'm gonna do something wrong. I'm gonna make a mistake. I'm gonna piss her off. I'll blow it and then then it's irreparable

1148
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:21,760
and I'd say, you know just

1149
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:26,720
Toucher don't you know if you have the impulse to touch or touch her if you have the impulse to tease your teaser

1150
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,720
If you have the impulse to tell her come on. Let's go do this

1151
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:30,960
Don't hold back

1152
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:32,960
It's crazy as it sounds. I tell guys

1153
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:35,520
Blurt and act on impulse

1154
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:37,760
You think that's a recipe for disaster

1155
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:44,720
But the truth is it lets them be themselves because their authentic self comes out and you know, I've had so many experiences

1156
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:48,160
You know around one if I just blurted acted on impulse

1157
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:51,680
You know, I remember one woman I dated on the second date

1158
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:54,560
We were going to go for a walk and she said, well, let me go use the restroom

1159
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:59,680
Restaurant and she went to the restroom came back and I so I'm gonna go use the restroom

1160
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:02,000
I said by the way enjoyed watching you walk away from me

1161
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:05,440
And as soon as I said it, I thought oh fuck. I probably blew it, you know

1162
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:08,720
After we broke up we stayed friends and said

1163
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:12,880
Months later said you remember when you said that to me said, yeah, I thought I blew it

1164
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:18,080
He goes, oh no, I loved it. Well, I it I just blurted it right. I didn't hold it back

1165
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:24,800
I remember another another woman early early first date where we're walking and she said something about her

1166
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:30,960
Her sister or sister-in-law they're they're having a shoe party, you know, where women get together and

1167
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,840
Look at shoes

1168
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:40,800
The lamest thing a tupperware. I can think of the a shoe party lamest party in history

1169
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:45,680
But okay, and so I blurted without thinking oh shoe shopping is women's porn

1170
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:48,480
She turned and looked at me and she goes

1171
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:51,520
You get it you understand

1172
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:58,000
You know and and and so guys will say well, I'm not funny, you know, I'm not I'm not, you know, I can't

1173
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:00,480
I'm not talking about telling jokes

1174
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:03,680
I'm talking about whatever that thing that came to the tip of your brain

1175
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:05,680
But you held it back

1176
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:10,320
Yeah, because you're afraid it might be the wrong thing to say the wrong thing to do as soon as you held it back

1177
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:16,880
You killed the tension the putting it out there and sometimes you crash and burn, you know, there's the sweat flops

1178
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:22,960
You go, oh man, that didn't get one laugh, you know, but you got to take that risk every comedian

1179
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:25,440
You know has had plenty of bombs

1180
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:28,400
to but man that one landed and

1181
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:32,880
And it's not about trying to get it right. It's about taking the sensors off

1182
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:38,080
And letting that you that maybe just speaks to the obvious

1183
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:43,680
Out there and people people they'll relate to it or they won't it seems a lot like

1184
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:46,720
one of the key

1185
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:48,240
tactics for

1186
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:51,200
Rehabilitating a nice guy is learning to kind of get out of your own way

1187
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:58,160
That's a good way to put it because what we've been doing is again go all the way back to where we began this

1188
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:03,600
They've been trying to manage their shame. I'm bad. I'm not good enough. I'm gonna be found out. I'm gonna die

1189
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Their anxiety. Oh, no, somebody will react negatively. There'll be pain involved

1190
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:12,400
And so that is what's driving the bus is their shame and their anxiety

1191
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:16,960
And so who is really in there? You know, who is the person?

1192
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:18,960
Um

1193
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:23,040
One of the things the comments I get from people that work with me or you know

1194
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:27,760
Come to my workshops or seminars or do calls with me. They'll say robert

1195
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,920
I appreciate how how authentic you are

1196
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:31,680
And I'll go

1197
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:33,920
Nobody would have accused me of that 30 years ago

1198
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:39,040
Nobody would have said robert. I love how real you are how authentic you are how you just share yourself

1199
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:42,320
How you share your mistakes you fuck ups. I didn't

1200
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:47,200
And and I couldn't attract a woman to save my life, you know back back in those days

1201
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:52,960
I I kind of could but I I didn't know that what I was what I did that might attract a woman

1202
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:57,200
But I wasn't real. I wasn't authentic. I was holding my finger up checking the wind

1203
01:26:57,200 --> 01:27:01,520
I was a chameleon, you know, what's what's gonna give me the most laughs or what's gonna give me, you know

1204
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:07,440
What will kind of go over well, but not too well that you know now I'm not on the spot that I got to follow through

1205
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:08,800
and

1206
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,800
man to just take the sensors off

1207
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:12,720
and just

1208
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:15,120
Blurt act on impulse be you

1209
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:20,480
I think is such a powerful rehabilitation and since most nice guys

1210
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:25,440
Their sensors are the most prominent with women. That's a great place to go practice

1211
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:31,680
One of my the same friend I was talking about before mr. Orthogonal tennis game george

1212
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:36,960
He he has this idea called only the irrational behavior survives. What he's talking about

1213
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:39,760
What he's talking about is he imagines

1214
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:43,360
being at the funeral of somebody that he knows and he

1215
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:48,720
Thinks about the conversations that the people are having around the room and they're not having the conversation

1216
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:53,760
The washing was always folded and he turned up on time and all the rest of it

1217
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:57,360
He uses this example of his mum and he says that his mum hates fighting

1218
01:27:57,680 --> 01:28:01,840
Just really just does not like physical fighting big big problem with it

1219
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:08,160
And once his brother was in the car his younger brother was in the car with her and they were driving somewhere and she

1220
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:10,880
I don't know 50s year old woman

1221
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:13,200
Normal british woman saw two

1222
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:18,720
18 year old boys sort of squaring up to each other and pushing and trying to fight or whatever on the side of the

1223
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:21,920
On the pavement. She stops the car in the middle of traffic

1224
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:26,880
Gets out and runs over and the brother's like mum. What the fuck are you doing?

1225
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,880
Like what the two guys

1226
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:32,640
Twice your size and quadruply a testosterone. What the fuck are you doing?

1227
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:36,640
She runs over and she gets in between them physically gets in between them like no fighting no fighting

1228
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:39,040
Gets back in the car and the brother's like mum. That was

1229
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:44,000
Insane, you could have been hurt. You could be what she's I don't care. I don't care. I just don't like fighting no one's fighting

1230
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:46,880
and he said at her funeral

1231
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:52,240
People will say she was the sort of person that would stop the car in the middle of traffic to stop two boys fighting

1232
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:58,720
And it's like that only the irrational behavior survives is is similar to what you're talking about that there are rough edges

1233
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:00,480
to

1234
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:02,480
our personality and our behavior

1235
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:09,600
But ultimately that is our personality and behavior like if your goal your goal should not be as a person on this planet

1236
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:15,760
to smooth out any of the things that make you anything into this sort of

1237
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,560
vanilla amorphous

1238
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:21,360
blob that kind of like just glides

1239
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:27,920
Through it's like no you have things that you want to say and actions that you want to take and changes that you want to make

1240
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:31,520
And just the faith to be able to do that unencumbered

1241
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:33,040
is

1242
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:38,480
That's what life is. Yeah, and and it takes support. It takes practice

1243
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:40,160
um

1244
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:43,760
Yeah, you know talking no more mr. Nice guy about nice guys being teflon men

1245
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:47,440
No stick, you know, nothing. I don't want anything to stick to me

1246
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:54,720
But we do connect as you said around our rough edges, you know, what we remember about people might not even been always a thing

1247
01:29:55,520 --> 01:30:00,160
It might even bugged us or got on our nerves when they did it and we're around them

1248
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:03,120
But it's also the thing we miss. I mean, you know

1249
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:09,120
Nala the pit bulls back at my my door again. I've got french glass doors so I can see her outside my office

1250
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:13,680
Yeah, you know when she barks during, you know, I'm on an interview a podcast

1251
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:18,160
It really bugs me but you know if I didn't have her and I'd notice

1252
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:20,160
Oh, I miss her bark

1253
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:25,840
You know, I love when she'd go crazy and let me know that somebody was out front our handyman

1254
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:30,880
The the water guys deliver a while they call my dog's name because they know she'll bark differently

1255
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:36,160
When she's had her name called and well and I would miss that if it if it ever went I go

1256
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:39,920
What's wrong with Nala? How come she doesn't bark at people outside anymore?

1257
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:47,200
Yeah, it's it's it's rough edges bore, you know, all that smooth get it right. No, you know, that's boring

1258
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:51,040
Why is your first sexual experience so important?

1259
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:54,240
You talking about mine

1260
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:00,400
Come on, even that's too far for me. Um, yeah

1261
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:05,600
First sexual experience. Why is it very formative? Okay, you know

1262
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:08,320
That

1263
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:10,240
That's a good question

1264
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:14,160
But it's also difficult one to answer because our first sexual experience is probably

1265
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:18,480
Conception, you know, I'd say birth. We're born sexual

1266
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:25,920
We're the the essence of who we are is sexuality every living thing is built to reproduce

1267
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:30,000
After its own so our sexuality is the essence of who we are

1268
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:36,880
We we kind of live culturally thinking well, you know, children don't become sexual until you know that

1269
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:39,360
particular age whatever that might be

1270
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:41,920
but the truth is, you know

1271
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:46,640
Little boys little girls discover their body parts that are very young age

1272
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:52,160
Oh, there's pleasure before you, you know, they understand the words of parents don't stop doing that, you know

1273
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:56,000
They're they're they're they're finding the pleasure in their own body parts

1274
01:31:56,560 --> 01:32:02,560
And the essence of our psyche is is is our our sexuality, you know, if

1275
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:07,600
So many great teachers, you know all the way from from Freud

1276
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:16,720
To david data to osho to david snarch people at least i value talk about the the most profound way into who we are

1277
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:24,000
Young is to our sexuality because it is the essence of who we are. So to bring that back to answering your question

1278
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:28,960
I will often ask people like in a workshop, you know, again, I primarily work with men these days. Well

1279
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:31,760
I 100% work with men these days

1280
01:32:32,240 --> 01:32:33,440
I'll ask them

1281
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:40,240
What was your earliest sexual memory and it doesn't matter what it was first time you notice you had an erection first kiss first wet dream

1282
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:44,320
First i'll show you mine. You show me yours first, whatever

1283
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:48,800
Uh, and it can vary for you every what but i'll just say what is your first memory?

1284
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:52,720
And then i'll say get it get clear in your mind. What was it?

1285
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:54,960
And then i'll ask them

1286
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:57,760
Did it occur in the open?

1287
01:32:57,920 --> 01:32:59,920
Could you go tell your folks about it?

1288
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,760
Could it be celebrated?

1289
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:07,280
Did your parents say that's amazing. Let's go get pizza. That's a you know, it's a developmental milestone

1290
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:14,640
Um, or was it hidden? Was it secretive? Was it guilt-ridden? Was it shame-based?

1291
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:20,320
Uh, even worse. Did it feel good? But you felt bad about it feeling good

1292
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:22,560
All right, so

1293
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:28,640
For about 99.9 of the people on the planet our earliest sexual experience

1294
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:31,200
Was wrapped in shame

1295
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:35,840
And in hidden darkness guilt i'm bad. I can't let anybody find out

1296
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:40,880
So our sexuality gets cross-wired with those features

1297
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:43,680
It's bad it's evil hide it

1298
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:46,880
Repress it don't let it out and then that takes

1299
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:53,280
You know as many different forms as there are people in terms of how that manifests from from there

1300
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:58,400
So then we get to be adolescents and adults and can't figure out why

1301
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:01,920
Sex is so messy so difficult so challenging. So

1302
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:05,600
You know, how come isn't work how come how come it's not easy?

1303
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:09,440
Yeah, people who think that they have a a low sex drive

1304
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:12,080
Might actually just be

1305
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:14,240
psychologically scarred from

1306
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:16,080
The way that they perceived it

1307
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:19,440
That's very possible. I and I've I've often said, you know, I

1308
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:25,120
Will get personal I didn't discover I didn't know I could actually masturbate myself to

1309
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:31,600
Ejaculation until I was a freshman in college. That's pretty late compared to most and and you know

1310
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:34,480
I was kind of a late bloomer in a lot of ways around sexuality

1311
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:36,480
And I was just well, that's just me

1312
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:42,000
But yeah, it's very likely me growing up in a fundamental christian church where I heard messages really early

1313
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:45,840
That if you lust after a woman's breast you go to all you go to hell for all eternity

1314
01:34:46,240 --> 01:34:49,440
You know where you know, my mom taught me to be not be like my dad

1315
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:54,080
Where you know, I listen to the women that he's a jerk. He only wants one thing, you know

1316
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:59,440
Yeah, there might have been some scarring that went into the you know, I'm trying to work out

1317
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:04,560
You know, it's better to not have a sex drive. Oh my penis betrayed me again by getting a wreck

1318
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:11,600
You know what stop doing that. You know, you know, I'm trying to work out from a first sexual experience

1319
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:17,280
My first the first time I had sex the girl who I worked with at the

1320
01:35:18,240 --> 01:35:19,760
local

1321
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:21,760
Hotel where I was the room service boy

1322
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:24,160
Do you know what?

1323
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:25,280
uh

1324
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:26,480
fucking

1325
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:28,480
What was it?

1326
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:36,160
A vw loopo is a loopo loopo. It's like the site. It's smaller than a fee at 500 and it was three door

1327
01:35:36,720 --> 01:35:38,720
and it was in a

1328
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:43,760
Uh, like an industrial estate halfway between did you have sex in the loopo?

1329
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:45,600
I had I

1330
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:49,360
If you think that having sex for the first time is difficult having sex for the first time in a car

1331
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:54,560
That's like half the size of a jumper just turns the turns the difficulty level up to 11

1332
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:59,760
um, but yeah, I maybe maybe that's I don't know what that means. We were next to a

1333
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:06,720
Like a Mercedes bends mechanics. Maybe that's why I love f1 so much. I'm not sure I keep getting an erection whenever I see Lewis Hamilton

1334
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:07,760
I'm not sure

1335
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:13,280
Uh, we could really spend my my first attempt was in a chevy vega

1336
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:20,400
You know, it probably slightly bigger slightly bigger the next time I tried it. It was on a park school bus. I got smart, right?

1337
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:22,800
Yeah, very nice

1338
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:26,000
Very good. Well, I mean the school bus. Yeah, but um, yeah, it's

1339
01:36:26,640 --> 01:36:30,880
It's it's very interesting to think about how we sort of internalize these stories

1340
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:37,440
And I had a do you know dr. Paul conty is so that was stanford. I've heard that name

1341
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:40,000
I couldn't tell you who he is but I have heard the name

1342
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:47,200
So he did a four-part series with andrew huberman last year. I've heard that name too. Yes. Yeah, so every everybody says that name all the time

1343
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:51,120
He's fantastic. They're both fantastic and um, paul does uh

1344
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:53,440
evidence-based

1345
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:55,440
unconscious work trauma

1346
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:57,520
and such

1347
01:36:57,520 --> 01:37:00,320
from a very medical standpoint and um

1348
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:05,280
He was talking to me. He gave me this really lovely frame very interesting about how

1349
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:08,640
Formative experiences in our past

1350
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:16,160
Can reshape the way that we see the entirety of that world but importantly they reshape our

1351
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:19,360
Memory of what it was like before that as well

1352
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:24,480
so for us to say something like uh, I get in a car accident when I'm 25 and

1353
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:31,360
Then you get travel anxiety which causes you to not enjoy driving or to feel anxious when you're driving and then at 35 you tell yourself

1354
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:32,960
I've never

1355
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:37,440
liked driving you were like no until the age of 25 you loved it. Do you not remember you did that thing?

1356
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:38,160
It's like no no no

1357
01:37:38,160 --> 01:37:40,160
I was anxious the whole time and this

1358
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:47,520
this ability that like the fallibility and the malleability of our memory and our sense of self and our understanding of ourselves

1359
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:51,680
um the fact that for sufficiently formative experiences

1360
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:53,680
can

1361
01:37:53,680 --> 01:37:58,160
Like manipulate those and mold them in a different way. I just thought was so

1362
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:01,360
It's fascinating but kind of brutal as well

1363
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:05,760
Well, and maybe this is a the same another way of explaining the same thing

1364
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:11,040
Every time we recall a memory we fundamentally change the memory

1365
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:17,040
Because every time we recall it we're now in a different emotional state a different position different surroundings

1366
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:18,720
We

1367
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:20,720
Accurate memory does not exist

1368
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:25,280
Right, you know what even even as we think we're remembering our earliest sexual experience

1369
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:28,080
You know if there was actually a camera they're filming it

1370
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:30,560
We might find out it's completely totally different

1371
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:34,400
Surrounding wise than we thought so every time we recall a memory

1372
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:40,080
We're altering it. So our memories keep changing over a lifetime. So um

1373
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:42,400
but what but

1374
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:46,560
What happens at that trauma we're talking about and that what I call the cross wiring

1375
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:54,320
That's happening at an emotional level and so it doesn't matter even if our memory is accurate in terms of you know, digitally

1376
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:57,760
Accurate what what matters is emotionally

1377
01:38:58,720 --> 01:39:02,000
How we move forward with it and so now if you know

1378
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:08,160
We've been a sexual creature since birth and all of a sudden something happens that sex is hidden

1379
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:13,600
Well, I better keep it hidden from from here on out and we don't make that as a conscious decision

1380
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:17,440
It's just an emotional roadmap that we start following

1381
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:19,760
Hmm

1382
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:27,760
It's very very interesting. Okay. So we identified this and people are sitting listening to you and I talking very openly about sexual experiences

1383
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:29,920
And they're going you're not supposed to do that

1384
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:36,960
You're not supposed to talk openly about those things because they're going on their emotional wiring of how you're supposed to you know

1385
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:41,280
Be about sex. Yeah. Well like the vw lupo opens all sorts of doors

1386
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:46,240
Um three of them exactly egg precisely correct unless you can clamber out the back honestly, dude

1387
01:39:46,240 --> 01:39:50,640
I I and I remember how not far the passenger seat went back as well

1388
01:39:50,640 --> 01:39:54,400
I just thought this is what and you got to do in the passenger seat because of the steering wheel

1389
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:56,800
But you guys have the steering wheel on the wrong side of the car

1390
01:39:57,360 --> 01:40:03,840
Well, speak for yourself. Look, we've gone through this litany of problems, right? This big big big big list and

1391
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:06,800
We don't have enough time to

1392
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:10,240
prescribe the panacea for all of the nice guys listening

1393
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,720
given the fact that you've done

1394
01:40:12,720 --> 01:40:14,560
so many

1395
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:17,360
seminars coaching sessions working with people

1396
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:21,680
What have you found if you were to give the biggest movers?

1397
01:40:22,640 --> 01:40:23,920
of

1398
01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:25,920
Rehabilitation for nice guys

1399
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:29,040
I don't think i've ever used that exact word for it

1400
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:31,840
What what what are the uh the practices?

1401
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:37,600
What are the places that they should focus on in order to start to embody themselves more honestly?

1402
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:40,320
Okay, yeah be their authentic selves exactly

1403
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:44,880
I'll just walk you through what I did number one. I tell people find safe people

1404
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:49,280
Don't try to do this on your own. You didn't become a nice guy in social isolation

1405
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:53,040
Don't try to get over it in social isolation

1406
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:59,520
We have to have safe people to start releasing our shame to tell people I've got this story about myself and people go

1407
01:41:00,160 --> 01:41:04,400
That's not bad. That's not terrible at all. You're know, that's normal what you're describing

1408
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:09,520
So we need safe people to support us release our shame perhaps mentor us

1409
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:16,960
Encourage us help us face our fears. So I tell nice guys go find a coach therapist men's group. I love men's groups

1410
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:18,640
do

1411
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:20,640
A big chunk of my own personal

1412
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:27,600
Rehabilitation in in men's groups. Uh, I was leading five men's groups a week when I was in private practice up in seattle

1413
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:32,560
Um, I just I'm a believer so find men's group. Don't try to do this alone

1414
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:36,640
How do you suggest to interject there? How do you know if it's a good men's group or a bad men's group?

1415
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:44,400
That that's a good question and it is somewhat subjective because something a group you love might not work for me

1416
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:53,680
When I started looking for something about all that existed at that time was the uh,

1417
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:58,720
The robert blei methyl poetic go out in the woods beat a drum have the talking stick and say, oh

1418
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:05,280
I did that I ended up in a 12-step program is where I started it not wasn't by choice. It just where I landed

1419
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:10,800
Um, I got I got lucky. I landed and I was in a men's group led by a woman

1420
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:15,520
Around sexual shame who liked men and so that was good for me

1421
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:20,960
I tried some other men's groups that I just never connected or resonated with

1422
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:27,200
A core piece I would recommend whether you're looking for a coach a therapist a men's group

1423
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:31,680
Is find somebody who leads it who's actually done their own work

1424
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:37,440
You mentioned embodiment quite a bit somebody who's actually gone out worked on their own stuff

1425
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:44,240
You know, I I became a therapist. I got my phd in marriage and family therapy at 29 years old

1426
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:49,680
Started you know a few years later started doing, you know trying to do real therapy

1427
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:52,320
I'd never been to therapy

1428
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:59,200
And you know, it wasn't till I got into therapy and men's groups and started working on my own

1429
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:04,480
Toxic shame and my own anxieties and my own patterns that I could actually really help people

1430
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:09,760
So, you know, um, it doesn't hurt to check out, you know, ask the person

1431
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:11,760
What's your journey?

1432
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:15,680
You know, we're we're if you worked on yourself and then just see do you connect with them?

1433
01:43:16,160 --> 01:43:17,920
Let's usually go place do you connect?

1434
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:25,760
So go go find a coach therapist men's group 12 step group something where you get to go start revealing you releasing toxic shame

1435
01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:30,880
Start being honest nice guys think they're honest or anything but honest

1436
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:33,600
I remember pretty early in my process

1437
01:43:34,160 --> 01:43:38,880
I realized almost everything I told my then wife was whatever won't rock the boat

1438
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:42,960
So I I told her I'm gonna work and be an honest whenever I catch myself

1439
01:43:43,680 --> 01:43:46,560
Making up a story to tell you I'm gonna come tell you

1440
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:50,880
I was gonna lie to you. Here's the lie. I was gonna tell you. Here's the whole truth

1441
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:56,960
So I started doing that and actually I used to tell her her middle name ought to be overreact because that's

1442
01:43:57,360 --> 01:44:02,560
What she did and every the funny thing was what actually just started telling her the truth about shit. She'd go, okay

1443
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:07,280
Thanks for telling me that I'm glad you didn't lie to me and you know, whoa, that's different

1444
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:12,000
You know when I was trying to get her not to overreact she did when I just told her the truth

1445
01:44:12,400 --> 01:44:18,640
Yeah, okay, don't lie to me. That was it. So work on being honest and again, we need safe people usually to do that

1446
01:44:19,680 --> 01:44:22,000
Work on making your needs a priority

1447
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:28,000
Sorry to ask yourself. What do I want? What's important to me? You know, am I do I do I need to go to the gym?

1448
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:31,600
Do I need to go to the dentist? Do I need to take some time to relax?

1449
01:44:32,160 --> 01:44:34,640
Do I need to rest my eyes? Do I need to go read a good book?

1450
01:44:34,720 --> 01:44:38,080
Do I you know, how do I get my needs met and how do I let people

1451
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:43,520
Help me get my needs met and how do I surround myself with people who want to help me get my needs met?

1452
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:46,960
Uh start working on boundaries

1453
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:53,200
That's that's a big one for nice guys is well, nobody grows into adulthood knowing how to set boundaries because

1454
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:56,400
Nobody teaches children how to set boundaries

1455
01:44:56,800 --> 01:44:57,360
um

1456
01:44:57,360 --> 01:45:03,360
Because in in the real world the big people get to do whatever they want to the little people and because we were all little people

1457
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:07,520
We never learned you could say no stop that i'm going to remove myself now

1458
01:45:08,240 --> 01:45:11,200
So learn about boundaries. I was in my thirties

1459
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:14,580
In my second marriage with a phd

1460
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:18,880
Before I had ever even heard of boundaries a therapist. I went to taught me about them

1461
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:25,360
So start working on boundaries and then I just I think the one other piece i'll throw out there that I think is just so fundamental

1462
01:45:25,680 --> 01:45:27,680
Especially for guys for nice guys

1463
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:28,880
go

1464
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:30,160
connect with men

1465
01:45:30,160 --> 01:45:31,040
Go

1466
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:37,600
Build a tribe of men. I've had to do that a few times in my life about seven years ago when I got married down here in

1467
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:39,360
Mexico

1468
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:43,200
Not yet fluent Spanish my wife only speaks Spanish

1469
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:45,920
And i'm living in here working at home

1470
01:45:46,720 --> 01:45:48,720
I I had no guys in my life

1471
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:53,200
And I went seeking and found a men's program and joined it and now

1472
01:45:54,720 --> 01:46:01,520
If you looked at my text messaging my calendars my email i'm on zoom i'm messaging with buddies

1473
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:04,480
all the friggin time and it just

1474
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:10,160
It makes everything about my world better. I'm I'm more on point with with my work

1475
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:14,880
My relationship improved. I'm in better health. I'm happier

1476
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:20,400
So build a connection with men. So there's about five things that are a pretty good start

1477
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:24,240
Dr. Robert Glover ladies and gentlemen, Robert I

1478
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:30,560
Adore your work. I think it's very much needed. It's so fascinating that it's been around for quite a while

1479
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:35,440
You know and and yet this single thread of guys being overly pliable

1480
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:39,760
Of resenting despite the fact that they're playing the game correctly. They think that they're doing all the rest of it

1481
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:42,400
is uh

1482
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:48,240
It's so fascinating and I I've today's been phenomenal. Where should people go? They want to keep up to date with your work

1483
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:49,440
You've got

1484
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:50,800
Trota the internet

01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:54,080
Yeah, dr. Glover.com, you know good place to start out

1486

1487
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:01,600

This uh, go find the big stick. Tony endlman is a certified coach. I I asked him a few years ago

1490
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:18,000
