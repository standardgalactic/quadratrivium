1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,840
No scientist who actually wanted to retain any credibility would claim that the correlation between rising CO2 and

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,520
Rising temperature at this very tiny piece of time is proof of causation

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,880
Correlation is not proof of causation

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,080
Patrick Moore welcome the show nice to be with you Chris

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,420
What is your background? How did you come to be involved in the environmental discussion?

6
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,260
Well rather checkered I have to admit

7
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:37,260
I grew up on a floating village on the north end of Vancouver Island with no road to that area

8
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,620
It was a west coast inlet. So we were like

9
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,340
Outlanders there and

10
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:47,260
Everything was by boat the freight came on a boat once a week

11
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,420
to a village of about a hundred people and

12
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:54,020
in 1965 when the road came finally a

13
00:00:54,740 --> 00:01:00,060
75-kilometer gravel road from Port Hardy on the other side of the North Island

14
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:06,660
Vancouver Island is the largest island on the west coast of the Americas from Alaska to Argentina

15
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,340
So it's a 300 mile long Island

16
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:15,100
and I was born on it and still live on it in a slightly more civilized part now

17
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,180
but I have a home on the beach where I grew up so I'm really lucky that way and

18
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:27,700
When the road came we thought wow now this place is just gonna explode half the people used the road to get out

19
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,700
so we learned something of human nature that day and

20
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,900
I then ended up being sent to boarding school because the one-room school

21
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,660
I went to till grade 8 only went to grade 8

22
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:46,060
So I was sent to Vancouver to st. George's school, which is modeled after the English public school and

23
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:51,220
There I excelled in science and particularly life science

24
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:57,700
Went to the University of British Columbia in an honors bachelor of science in biology and forestry

25
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:04,100
Which is the industry I grew up in and it's what we have almost on the entire province is trees and

26
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:11,340
much of which is in parks and much of which is in places where you're allowed to cut them and make lumber and paper and

27
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:17,940
So I then discovered the word ecology before it had been in the popular press and

28
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:27,700
realized it was an obscure branch of science going back to the late 1800s which basically dealt initially with soil forming processes and

29
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,300
When you when you understand soil science you understand that all life

30
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:38,140
emanates from soil on the land that is not it not in the ocean of course

31
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:45,980
But it it then led me to realize that ecology was about the interrelationships among all the factors on earth

32
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:52,740
Especially with relation to life, but life is made of rocks and air and water

33
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:58,660
So it includes those two and all those factors that come into effect

34
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:06,100
So it's almost like infinity the number of interrelationships there are and infinity is kind of a spiritual

35
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:12,380
Concept because none of us can actually fathom it and so as an agnostic in my family

36
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:20,900
My whole family was not particularly religiously oriented. I suddenly discovered religion in a

37
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,920
Non-religious sense in a way in science I

38
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,780
discovered the wonder of the infinity of

39
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,380
life and the universe and

40
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:38,820
Realized it was unfathomable at a certain level, but that we could know more about it

41
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:46,900
By studying it and that's where I got my beginnings and then I learned about while doing my PhD

42
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:52,740
I learned about this little group that was beginning to meet in the basement of the Unitarian Church in Vancouver

43
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,820
to plan a protest voyage against US hydrogen bomb testing in

44
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,020
Alaska taking on the world's most powerful organization at that time

45
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,460
a bunch of hippies and

46
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,380
But we were actually all professionals of one sort or another

47
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:14,340
It just that of course we looked like hippies because it was the hippie era in the early 70s and we sailed on that boat

48
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,100
12 of us and

49
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:22,100
John Cormack and his 12 disciples as we called ourselves and

50
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:28,100
We caused quite a ruckus and got on Walter Cronkite's evening news in the United States and

51
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,900
Help change the course of nuclear weapons

52
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:38,140
Development it was the cusp of the Cold War when they stopped increasing the number of nuclear weapons

53
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:42,580
And we stopped those nuclear tests on Amchitka Island in the Aleutians

54
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:47,180
Then went on to campaign against French atmospheric nuclear testing

55
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:53,820
France was still detonating hydrogen and atomic bombs in the air in the southern hemisphere in French Polynesia and

56
00:04:54,100 --> 00:05:00,660
The French people didn't even know this was happening because France controlled all the media including Le Mans and we got in

57
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,980
We got this issue in Le Mans for the first time in France and the campaign against that began

58
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,580
domestically as well as internationally and

59
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,500
Oh just

60
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:19,380
The rest is history. We stopped the killing of 30,000 whales per year in the North Pacific when we turned from the nuclear issue

61
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,140
having one two major victories

62
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,900
And then three four years of campaigning

63
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:34,860
Against the ocean killing of whales by big factory fleets. It took that long, but we ended that by 1981

64
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:40,620
Deep Sea whaling was banned in all the oceans of the world by the International Whaling Commission

65
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,620
which is a branch of the UN and

66
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:49,820
So we lobbied at the UN and we went out on the ocean and got in front of the harpoon. So we had footage of people actually

67
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,500
Trying to save the whale from being killed by a harpoon

68
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:59,260
that's what made made it and that made us famous and then we started making a lot of money and

69
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:03,140
Then we hired a lot of people and then we had a payroll to meet and then as

70
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:09,980
Time went on the left sort of I guess realized that there was money and power in this new

71
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:15,980
Environmental movement that we had helped create along with many other groups, but we were the only ones at one point

72
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,180
We're talking about Greenpeace

73
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,420
Specifically is the movement here at what point did it become Greenpeace?

74
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:26,500
It became Greenpeace right at the beginning at the hydrogen test when you went up to Alaska

75
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:34,060
Yes, when when one of the people in the church basement meetings said as we were breaking up the meeting someone said see you later

76
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:38,940
and said peace because peace then meant sort of see you later and

77
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,740
Someone's he said why don't we make it a Greenpeace?

78
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,860
And so it started there. So we named our boat the Greenpeace

79
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:51,700
We nicknamed our boat that we went to it was named the Phyllis Cormack after the captain's wife

80
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:56,980
but we put a big sign saying Greenpeace on the front of it on the cabin and

81
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,140
By the middle of next well early next year the same

82
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:10,180
1972 we changed our name from what it had been that don't make a wave committee to the Greenpeace foundation

83
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,420
That's much better. That's much better as it goes. Yes

84
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:19,660
Foundation wasn't because we were wealthy like foundations are it was because of the Asimov trilogy

85
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:26,580
About the small group of people on the opposite side. What star what Star Wars is fashioned after

86
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,660
that that took on the Empire and

87
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:35,340
We were taking on the Empire indeed and succeeded. What about your exit?

88
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:40,260
My exit was unfortunate, but it was caused by the fact

89
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:45,420
That as we became more well-known and powerful and political

90
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:51,580
The we were basically hijacked by the left in the end who were more clever at politics than we were

91
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,140
as that was their game and

92
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,100
So I ended up being the only

93
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,900
Director of Greenpeace International during the last six years from

94
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:08,380
79 when we created Greenpeace International, and I was instrumental in the negotiations that brought that about

95
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,140
And until 86 when I left I

96
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:22,020
Was the only director with any formal science education and we were now dealing with toxic waste and issues of chemistry and

97
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,620
You don't need to be a PhD

98
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:32,740
Marine biologist to know to save the whales or you don't need to be a nuclear physicist to want to stop hydrogen bombs

99
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:39,340
But if you're going to get into the issue of toxicology and now where they're calling plastic toxic, right?

100
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,700
And calling carbon dioxide toxic

101
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,420
Which is complete BS?

102
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:48,660
you've got to know some chemistry and you've got to understand toxicology and

103
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,900
Because toxicology is not just about something being poisonous

104
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:58,540
It's about how much of it does it take to be poisonous which is known as the poison is in the dose

105
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:04,740
Which is basically the first rule of toxicology such like do no harm is in medicine

106
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:11,220
The poison is in the dose is and like for example table salt is one of the best examples

107
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:19,060
It is an essential nutrient sodium chloride right with chlorine in it is an essential nutrient you die without it

108
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:25,460
That's why Gandhi made salt at the sea so they didn't have to pay a tax on something that was essential for life

109
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,180
well at a certain point it

110
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,740
Gets to be too much and if you actually ingest four or five tablespoons of

111
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,620
Table salt all at once

112
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:45,340
You're likely to die because it becomes toxic at those higher levels and you also have you at four or five tablespoons

113
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,820
Sitting on the counter isn't harmful to you

114
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,860
It's only harmful if you're exposed to it

115
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:54,100
So there's a lot of issues in toxicology

116
00:09:54,660 --> 00:10:01,580
That just got ignored in the whole thing and then suddenly I find my other five directors in Greenpeace

117
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:08,780
Agreeing that we should have a campaign to ban chlorine worldwide that would be our next big campaign and

118
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:15,060
It was based on the fact that chlorine was a constituent of dioxins DDT and

119
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,860
Other chlorinated hydrocarbons

120
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:22,140
Chlorinated hydrocarbons are a very common group of

121
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:30,300
Molecules because carbon is the basis of life and chlorine is essential as in sodium chloride salt

122
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:35,540
So there's lots of chlorinated hydrocarbons around and not all of them are toxic

123
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,140
At at at low levels and some of them are

124
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,620
But banning chlorine specifically

125
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,140
Was such a stupid idea

126
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:50,380
Seeing as though it is the most important element for public health adding it to drinking water

127
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,820
Swimming pools spas as we use bromine also these days

128
00:10:54,900 --> 00:11:00,780
There was a time when iodine which is another one of the halogens in that group along with chlorine

129
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:06,980
Was the most important thing in your in your medicine cabinet as it was when I was a child if you got a cut

130
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,540
You put iodine on it to stop infection

131
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:18,940
And so there's that reason for chlorine the other reason is that 85% of our pharmaceuticals are made with chlorine chemistry and

132
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:25,540
25% of them actually have chlorine in them if you look at the ingredients in your cold or flu medicines

133
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:30,820
Just for an example, you'll see a little cl after a lot of them. That's chlorine

134
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,500
so at a purely

135
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:41,020
Scientific perspective, I couldn't stay in a group that was going to launch a campaign to ban chlorine worldwide

136
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,420
But that was just the sharp end of the stick for some years

137
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:53,620
After a long evolution 15 years for me from the beginning of being involved in the beginning of the environmental movement or the modern environmental movement

138
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:59,380
We actually had a fairly strong humanitarian orientation in the early years

139
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,620
we were trying to save civilization from all out nuclear war and

140
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,620
So that must means you care about people as

141
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,860
Well as the environment which was the green part of Greenpeace

142
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:18,020
But the peace part of Greenpeace was to end nuclear war or the threat of nuclear war and we did a pretty good job of helping with that and

143
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:23,220
But by the time I had to leave the environmental movement

144
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,980
Now controlled largely by the political left

145
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:32,180
Had basically changed the tune to humans are the enemies of the earth

146
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:39,940
Humans are the enemies of nature as if we are the only bad or evil species on the planet

147
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:44,740
And everything else is either benign or good or whatever you want to say, but they're not evil

148
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:51,060
Right just so this is original sin reinvented for environmentalism as it is in

149
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,540
extreme Christianity and I suppose other religions

150
00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:00,180
I don't know much about other ones, but I do know that in Christianity

151
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:05,100
There's a wing of it that considers humans to be born with evil in them

152
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:12,100
Not that they don't have some good in them, but I don't believe that one iota

153
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:18,620
I just think we're it's not even an irrelevant thing to discuss. Why do you think that transition happened?

154
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:24,620
From it being about peace to this Alex Epstein calls it human racism

155
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:32,420
Yes, it's the same reason why Americans now think America is evil even though they are Americans

156
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,860
I it's self loathing is another way of expressing it

157
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,140
It is a deeply

158
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:49,300
Destructive mental condition to believe that you are evil even when you're good and

159
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,820
So I what it is. So why is it?

160
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:58,300
Why did it happen fear of death? I think is at the root of it

161
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,300
That's why doomsday

162
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:08,660
Predictions are made throughout history is because people believe that when they die the world will end

163
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,500
Because they think they're so bloody important or something

164
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,580
I don't know what it is

165
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:20,060
But it is it is the fear of owns one own one's own death projected on the universe or or on the world

166
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:24,300
End times apocalypse they keep saying it's going to happen

167
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:31,180
They've been saying it for 10,000 years or more this little guy standing on a street corner with a sign saying the end is near

168
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,020
Well, they used to say the end is nigh

169
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:36,340
But I think that's an English term that nobody knows what it means anymore

170
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:41,440
But the end is near right and that's what aOC is saying and that's what

171
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:49,340
Greta is saying and that's what the ice IPCC is basically saying. That's what the World Economic Forum is saying

172
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,980
That's what Biden is saying. They're all saying the end is near

173
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:59,220
Because of climate change now now it used to be because of the devil or witches or something like that

174
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:05,700
But now it's because of climate change that the end is near and I'm sure it's a projection of one's own fear of death

175
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:10,820
One of the reasons I'm sure of that is that I don't think that way and I'm not afraid of my own death

176
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:18,540
I have absolutely no fear of it because there's one thing that you must do in life is not to worry about things

177
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:23,700
You can't do anything about because then you'd be worrying about way too many things and you'd never get anything done

178
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:28,220
and so I only worry about things that I can do something about and

179
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:35,340
As as far as I can see I can't do anything about the fact that I have a

180
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:41,100
Short life on this earth short meaning under a hundred years or so

181
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,460
it definitely does feel like

182
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,420
there's a narrative at the moment of

183
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,420
human racism of

184
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,820
the

185
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:59,420
descriptions of humanity being a scourge on the earth people are made to feel guilty about the cars that they drive or the flights that they take or

186
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,620
You know, you have Greta Thumberg going back from conferences on a

187
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:06,900
Rowing boat and it's taken a six months to get back across the Atlantic. I

188
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,140
Don't know I

189
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,420
Think I'm unconvinced that

190
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,780
all of this

191
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,780
Can be attributed to

192
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,540
The denial of death, you know, Ernest Becker might agree

193
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:23,460
But I'm not sure that all of it could be but I don't know where else it could come from

194
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:28,180
It's definitely a you know fear is a very good control mechanism for people. So there are other

195
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,140
There are other powers at play there

196
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:37,220
However, I don't understand why people would take it and imbibe it themselves and then start to push it back out

197
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:40,660
Because if it's something that is that makes you feel uncomfortable

198
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:45,340
I even most people tend to shy away from it, but it really does feel like

199
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,420
People have become their own torturers with this, you know

200
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,340
It's almost

201
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:57,420
Part for the course that humans are damaging the earth that we're causing harm and that we shouldn't be here

202
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,740
You said it and I I too

203
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:07,500
Don't know if I have the whole picture, but I think that's part of it now fear and guilt

204
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,460
You see those are the two that when they're combined

205
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:18,380
Are so powerful in controlling people the way I put it is you're driving your SUV down the road

206
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,980
You're afraid that you were killing your grandchildren

207
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:28,580
By putting out the toxic co2, which is actually the main food for all life on earth why they can't get that

208
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:34,780
I don't know but it is it is a fact and it is not toxic

209
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:42,580
Etc. But there is a fear and then that makes you feel guilty because you're killing your grandchildren

210
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:48,140
right so fear and guilt that's why I call the chapter in my book climate of fear and guilt and

211
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:55,380
Michael Crichton used the word fear in his book on climate change as well. I

212
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:01,180
Forget the whole title, but the word fear climate of might have been climate of fear, but

213
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,620
the the the fear

214
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:08,100
That is put into people about the end times, you know

215
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:16,540
And if people would just think straight they would realize that people have been predicting the end times since practically the beginning of time

216
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:20,540
And they have never once been right

217
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,180
They are batten zero on

218
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:29,340
End times right so why should we believe the new end times story?

219
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:34,140
Well because this one's backed up by science and it's got all of these people around the world

220
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:41,660
They all agree with each other. There's research. There's studies that have been done and you have 80% of scientists say that climate change is real

221
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,700
well

222
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,820
This is because lying has become acceptable to a lot of people

223
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,140
bald-faced lying

224
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:55,500
It the 80% thing or the 97% thing is a lie

225
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,700
It's been shown to be a lie in the they you know

226
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:04,860
This one study that said it was 97% done by a psychologist from Australia

227
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:10,100
And not a sign not really a scientist. That's a soft science at best and

228
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:18,900
He came up with this 97% number when analyzed and this Christopher Moncton was involved in this reanalysis

229
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,260
along with a couple of other really smart people on numbers and

230
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:31,260
Statistics and it turns out to be 0.3% not 97% who actually in their paper

231
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,980
Declared that humans

232
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,860
Will cause a climate disaster basically

233
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,660
Many of them said humans have a role in climate change

234
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,260
But they didn't say it was going to be a disaster

235
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,620
so

236
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:52,660
That if you break down what people actually said or even inferred

237
00:19:53,460 --> 00:20:00,100
You will not find that many climate scientists who will outright come out and say this is a climate emergency

238
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:04,520
The scientists are hiding behind the politicians who fund them

239
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:13,460
That's where they get all their money. They get their money from politicians through bureaucrats in the deep state in the United States

240
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:19,980
I don't know what you have as equivalent to the deep state, but having watched Boris rise to fame

241
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,620
I can't fathom what caused that

242
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:29,740
So it must have been some kind of weird political good hairdo. That's what that's what yeah, right

243
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,900
Let's not talk about that anymore

244
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:41,380
Is my attitude towards it because I just watched these things somebody came out today and said that polar bears are inbreeding

245
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:47,220
Right and that's because there's not enough ice for them to find each other anymore. Is that same? Oh

246
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,100
Yeah, right

247
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:57,620
That's so weird is that true that it well first what is inbreeding, right?

248
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:04,740
Is it beyond cousins or second cousins anything closer than that genetically? That's our definition of it

249
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:11,620
Yes, but in plant breeding for example and animal breeding in breeding is commonly used in

250
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,620
In order to maintain characteristics that are desirable

251
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:21,700
But I've seen I've seen tigers that have got down syndrome from too tight inbreeding

252
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:29,620
Yes, but inbreeding is absolutely necessary like you're not going to start breeding with snails

253
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,260
right so

254
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,260
How far out does it go?

255
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:38,500
Well, it needs to be within your own species, but not within your own hereditary genetic pool

256
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:43,940
Yeah, but it should it should always be someone of another race, right because that's the most outbreeding you can get

257
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:48,100
Right, it should never be anybody in your own race because that's inbreeding

258
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:53,380
You see inbreeding and outbreeding are flexible terms in that sense

259
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,180
There's extreme inbreeding

260
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,500
And there's extreme outbreeding

261
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,820
right

262
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,820
If you outbreed you water down

263
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:06,100
The genetics if you inbreed you concentrate them

264
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:12,340
A combination of those two things is always essential in species evolution

265
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,660
and

266
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:20,340
So therefore they're just using the word inbreeding as a political term rather than a scientific term

267
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,380
There because inbreeding is bad period

268
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,900
Right

269
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:29,540
That's that's how they're getting away with that and the idea that they aren't finding enough of each other

270
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:34,740
The the population of polar bears has grown by four or five times since the treaty

271
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,220
Do you know about the treaty on polar bears?

272
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:45,700
So you do but nobody else does because they never mention it. They never mentioned that in 1973 on the advice of wildlife biologists

273
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:52,260
Because too many people were now able to go to the Arctic in planes and hire Inuit guides and get polar bear rugs

274
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:58,980
There were too many people doing that it was had become too easy and rich people were able to easily do that

275
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:03,380
So the polar bear population was declining due to over hunting

276
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:12,020
So the all the nations with polar bears signed a treaty international treaty to and the unrestricted hunting of polar bears

277
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,180
In other words, there had been no restrictions

278
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:18,260
On killing polar bears up till then because there didn't seem to need to be any

279
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,780
Because there was lots of polar bears and hardly anybody ever went up there and killed one

280
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,540
Besides which they're really mean and horrible and they'll kill you if you don't watch out

281
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:30,260
But with a high powered rifle the odds are turned in your favor

282
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:37,860
So they signed that treaty and since then the polar bear population has grown from somewhere between six to 10 000

283
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,500
to somewhere between 30 and 50 000

284
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,740
those are the

285
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:46,420
accepted figures by all the people involved in this except for

286
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:51,940
Uh fakers, which are not scientists, right? They're political activists

287
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,060
Give me your thoughts on extinction rebellion

288
00:23:55,620 --> 00:24:01,060
They're really really stupid and bad

289
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,220
Elaborate on your thoughts about extinction rebellion

290
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:13,060
Well, because you you come from right you come from greenpeace co-founder of greenpeace and extinction rebellion

291
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:19,780
There there seems to be people could see some sort of lineage or progression or connection, you know, it's an environmentalist movement

292
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:23,780
No, there's no lineage or progression. We didn't dress up like cult

293
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,620
teams of a cult movement like all dressed in

294
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:33,940
Really stupid looking red uniforms that are somewhere but across between the inquisition

295
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:37,220
and uh a cartoon uh

296
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:42,820
And spraying blood on buildings and this sort of thing actually

297
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:47,220
I signed off when people started chaining themselves to other people's stuff

298
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,940
Peace peacefulness pacifism

299
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,420
Is non-violence, right?

300
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,820
but

301
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:02,340
It doesn't include inciting other people to violence against you. That is not pacifism

302
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,060
in other words

303
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:11,700
By you making the first blow or you chaining yourself to someone's tractor who is trying to make a living with it

304
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,660
That is not peaceful

305
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,860
And yet

306
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:20,820
They they were basically saying that anything short of killing the other person is peaceful

307
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,940
Almost, you know, it it's not peaceful

308
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:30,100
To interfere with other people's livelihoods in a way that threatens their livelihood. That's not peaceful

309
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:36,260
But they think that they think that this is a really important and just worthy cause they need to get attention and people aren't looking

310
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,260
So they need to do more

311
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,260
So why don't they go with the Taliban?

312
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:45,940
That would be good. They then they'd have machine guns and they could kill anybody they wanted and have mass murder

313
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:51,620
To destroy the human race, you know, that's more or less what they're

314
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,740
Recommending as far as I can see

315
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:58,100
Uh, so I think they are I think they are evil

316
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:05,380
There are good people and bad people and people that are sort of in between like actually most people are a little bit good and a little bit bad

317
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,020
But these people are evil

318
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:14,180
That's what I think of extinction rebellion. What about Greta Thunberg the other one of the other horsemen of the

319
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,420
environmental apocalypse

320
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:22,820
Yeah, well, it's funny that people didn't notice right away that she is a young girl with pigtails

321
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,580
Because uh, that's what Stalin and Mao

322
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,700
And hitler all used young girls

323
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,860
with pigtails

324
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,500
In their photographs that's all been well documented

325
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,820
um, I don't know what the pigtails has to do with it, but uh

326
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,300
dictators all

327
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,500
Often it seems almost always use children

328
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:48,500
As as a front to make it look as though

329
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,660
They're nice

330
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:55,540
I suppose. I'm not sure what they're Danish though. Is there someone someone in Denmark sending her over

331
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,460
Is there some totalitarian leader in Denmark trying to get Greta Thunberg to?

332
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:05,220
No, the movement is totalitarian right and the movement the movement controls her

333
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:11,220
Uh, green she she's she's there's all kinds of photographs of her on trains with the head of Greenpeace

334
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:15,220
Etc. I mean and and of course Al Gore and

335
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,940
The list is endless

336
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:21,140
And her speeches are written for her obviously

337
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:26,100
And she doesn't know anything much about climate change or science

338
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,620
So what what is she then she's simply a tool?

339
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:34,740
Right. She is just a tool nothing more. She is not a wise person

340
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,340
Telling us what we should be doing

341
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:45,780
She is being used by Hollywood actors and phony politicians like Al Gore

342
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:50,100
Uh, none of none of whom actually have any science

343
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:53,940
What scientist is behind Greta Thunberg?

344
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,140
Thunberg I should say

345
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:02,020
It sounds like you've got a problem with the delivery mechanism, especially for

346
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:07,220
Extinction Rebellion and I can absolutely agree with you there. I don't think that going and

347
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:13,540
Hammering and chiseling the front door of banks or trying to erect structures in the middle of London Bridge

348
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:18,740
I don't think that that's a a fantastic way to get people on side simply from a human psychology perspective

349
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:24,100
If you want to compel people to be a part of your cause you need to convince them not terrorize them

350
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,180
Terrorize them that being said

351
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:31,380
Yeah, yeah, but I mean gluing your breasts to the street for example. Has that happened?

352
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,100
Yes gluing gluing

353
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:37,220
Your breasts what like so lying face down

354
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:42,820
And and gluing your breasts to the concrete so that you can't be moved so that you're blocking the traffic or whatever

355
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,020
Okay, right

356
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:49,460
So that that's the kind of thing they do and I agree that it's very sensational and everything

357
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:54,180
But it has absolutely nothing to do with the issue whatsoever whatever the issue is

358
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:58,900
I don't even know what their issue is. Is it that humans are should be exterminated?

359
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,620
It seems to be that would be basically their issue

360
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,060
and

361
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:08,260
So I recommended that a man glue his penis to the top of a of a

362
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,060
subway car

363
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:14,920
And somebody did a cartoon of it on twitter as a result of my suggestion

364
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,740
Right, so as you can disagree one of the five

365
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,780
Unacceptable words either no no

366
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:31,700
You can disagree with their methods, but there is an awful lot of

367
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:40,420
Well-known people who appear to have credentials saying that we are in a climate emergency, which we are aren't we?

368
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,940
No, we are not

369
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,180
in a climate emergency

370
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:50,420
I don't know people say to me well all you have to do is look outside

371
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,780
To see that it's a climate emergency

372
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:59,460
I I'm looking outside and I see a beautiful green mountain with a glacier on top of it where I live

373
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:04,420
And a whole mountain range right next to me and the whole of vancouver island is as healthy as can be

374
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:09,620
And yet they say it's been stripped mind of all its trees. No, it has not

375
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,660
What do you think they mean when they say climate emergency?

376
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,060
I

377
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:21,140
Think they mean the end times are coming. It's just another way of saying we're all doomed

378
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,580
Right because if there was an emergency

379
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,380
It means that if you don't do anything about it, you're doomed

380
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:33,540
We got upgraded right it was climate crisis and then within the last couple of years it is now climate emergency

381
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:38,820
Precisely, and I can't imagine what more extreme word they could now invent

382
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,380
after they've come from

383
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,580
you know

384
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:49,780
Crisis to emergency change crisis emergency. Yeah, there isn't you are right. There isn't much left, but there's there's so many

385
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,260
differing

386
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:55,620
Critiques around what the impact is that humans have had on the planet

387
00:30:55,620 --> 00:31:00,820
So the world getting too hot for instance increases in the temperature. That's something that's happening. Is it not?

388
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:08,420
The world has been warming ever so slightly since about 1700 when the little ice age

389
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,540
Stopped getting colder and started getting warmer

390
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:18,660
There have been these thousand year cycles for the last 6,000 years of the interglacial period known as the Holocene

391
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:22,500
Which we are in now, which is about 12,000 years long

392
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:27,940
Since we emerged from the last major glaciation which peaked 22,000 years ago

393
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:35,300
Which was one of 45 major glaciations that have occurred during the place to see an ice age over the last 2.6

394
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:41,380
million years, which is the first ice age in 250 million years since

395
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,860
The previous ice age

396
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:47,220
Ended after a hundred million years

397
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:51,780
From 350 million years ago to 250 million years

398
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:56,420
There was another ice age the previous one to this one

399
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:00,420
Since the last 250 million years until recently

400
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,620
Which was 2.5 million years ago

401
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,540
It was warmer than it is now at all times

402
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:13,060
It is now colder than it has been even in this interglacial period

403
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,260
During this place to see an ice age

404
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:19,140
Which has gone up and down and up and down and up and down

405
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:27,220
In cycles of 41,000 years for the first 1.6 million years and in cycles of 100,000 years for the last

406
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:32,020
1 million years in concert with the two molankovitch cycles

407
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:37,300
Related to the tilt of the earth changing and the orbit of the earth changing shape

408
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:43,300
This is caused by the gravitational attraction of jupiter on our earth

409
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:49,220
And so these people want us to think that the world began in 1850

410
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,860
When we started using fossil fuels

411
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:58,980
But for 150 years before that it was also warming and during one of those warming spurts because

412
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:02,100
When the earth warms it just doesn't warm continuously

413
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:06,900
It goes up and then down and then up and then down and then up and then down but net warming

414
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:12,260
Net cooling looks like this down and then up down and then up down and then up

415
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,140
There's cycles within cycles within cycles

416
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,860
We understand very few of these cycles

417
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:22,500
We certainly don't know what causes the onset of an ice age

418
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:27,780
Such as the one we are in now and we have no idea when it will end

419
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:31,780
Because actually at the bottom level it is still getting colder

420
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,580
And until we came along

421
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,700
Only 150 years ago

422
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:42,340
We started restoring a balance to the global carbon cycle

423
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:48,740
By putting some of the carbon back into the atmosphere that had been taken out by life

424
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:55,940
And drawn down co2 to the lowest level it has ever been in the history of the planet

425
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,020
Which is 4.6 billion years

426
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,500
So when was the lowest?

427
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,300
22 million years 22,000 years ago

428
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:07,060
co2 sank to 180 parts per million

429
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:11,140
Due to the cooling of the glaciation

430
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:15,700
Causing the oceans to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere

431
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,940
Liquids hold more gas when they're cold and when they're warm

432
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,980
Air holds more humidity

433
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,940
In other words gas

434
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:31,780
When gaseous forms of what can be liquids

435
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:37,460
Holds more of it when they're warm like warm air holds more water than cold air does

436
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:42,100
That's why fogs form when the air cools because it condenses. So it's the exact opposite

437
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,180
water

438
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:48,260
And in particular holds more gas when it's cold

439
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,820
So when the earth cools

440
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:55,460
The oceans absorb co2 from the atmosphere and the the total co2

441
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:59,860
There's nearly 50 times as much co2 in the oceans as there is in the atmosphere today

442
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,260
That wasn't always the case

443
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:06,420
Because the atmosphere had a lot more co2 in it in the past

444
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,220
Going back 200 million years

445
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,940
It had about 2,000 ppm

446
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:15,620
Today it's 400 because of our

447
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:20,500
Increasing it from when we came along it was 280

448
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:24,820
So you do agree that we as humans have had an impact on the climate

449
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:30,180
No, just producing co2 doesn't mean you're having an impact on the climate

450
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,860
The primary impact of increased co2 is more plant growth

451
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:38,900
And that's called the greening of the earth and nasa has verified this with

452
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:45,060
Maps on the internet and so has csiro in australia, which is the one they're the one that broke it

453
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:50,180
in in 2014 or I think it was

454
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:54,820
When they showed a map showing up to 30 increased photosynthesis

455
00:35:55,300 --> 00:36:00,340
Due to increased co2 in the atmosphere. So that is the main known fact

456
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:04,020
From what has happened as a result of more co2 in the atmosphere

457
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:10,980
There is zero evidence that the co2 increase in the atmosphere is the cause of rising temperature

458
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:19,940
None whatsoever because it was already rising as I was about to say during the first 150 years of rising out of 1700

459
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:24,500
There was a period of over 40 years

460
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:31,460
Where the temperature increased more and faster than it has done since 1850

461
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:40,500
Especially since 1950 when we were actually starting to put a significant amount more co2 in the atmosphere post war

462
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,220
And today

463
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:47,700
It's exponential. There's a wonderful graph. It's in my book which shows

464
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,900
The temperature record in central england

465
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:58,900
From 16 60 or so when the first first thermometer existed. So this is this is the longest

466
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:05,140
thermometer record of temperature in the world because they were invented in england

467
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:13,620
And so that shows a very steady continuous rise in temperature of a little over one degree celsius

468
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,840
in 320 years

469
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,700
It's not a big deal

470
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:26,500
Certainly compared to previous like they they keep saying it's never gone this fast. It's never risen this fast

471
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:32,020
That is a lie. It has risen this fast many times in the even recent past

472
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:37,060
Especially from about 1690 to about 1730

473
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:42,420
It rose faster and longer than it ever has done since

474
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:50,260
It's all in the record. Now, they'll say, oh, that's just a local measurement. Well, all measurements are local measurements

475
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:54,980
But not if you aggregate them across multiple, right? No, that's called the climate

476
00:37:55,300 --> 00:38:01,380
If you aggregate them across global except global is really badly skewed by there being by far the most

477
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:08,420
Measuring centers in north america and europe and hardly any in many other places, especially africa. So

478
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:14,820
It even that is skewed badly in terms of localism, but never mind that

479
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:23,620
The fact of the matter is is climate is a 30 year average of each weather

480
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,100
Event, right?

481
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:32,500
Whether it's hurricanes or tornadoes tornadoes are almost non-existent in the united states this year compared to previous years

482
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:35,140
For some reason the conditions just didn't happen

483
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,820
Because united states has 90 of the world's tornadoes

484
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:44,500
There's a reason for that. It's geographic. It's because from the arctic to the gulf of mexico

485
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:48,020
There are no mountains in the way because that was an inland sea

486
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:52,660
The prairies in other words of the united states

487
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:57,220
Were end of canada that was that was the sea bottom at one point

488
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:02,420
And so it's a straight shot for arctic air to come all the way down to the gulf of mexico and for hot

489
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:06,500
Gulf of mexico air to come all the way up and they combine and boom

490
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:14,500
And that's how hurricanes are formed too is the convergence of cold and warm air masses and that's why when the earth warms

491
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,620
The tropics

492
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:21,940
hardly changes when the earth warms the warming is is

493
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:29,940
What's the not inadvertently is greater anyways the warming is always greater towards the poles when the earth warms

494
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:35,380
It wasn't that long ago when all the arctic islands of canada were covered in forest

495
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:39,620
And there was giant camels roaming there five million years ago. That's not very long ago

496
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:44,900
That that's five million years is like an eternity to these people. They don't even know what it means

497
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,460
right, so if we have

498
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:52,420
Most of the effects of global warming or of any warming that occurs at the poles

499
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:58,100
Presumably that is going to increase the melting of those ice caps. Is there a concern whether it is

500
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:02,820
man-made or otherwise cyclical in nature or simply a trend over time

501
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:07,940
Should we be concerned about increased warming rising sea levels?

502
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:14,100
We have a lot of coastal cities. We have people who live there who may not be able to move very easily

503
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,900
Is that a danger

504
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:21,220
People who can't move very easily. Do you have some of those are the in wheelchairs or what?

505
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:26,500
You have people who may I say I say two things about this

506
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,500
number one

507
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,500
You won't have to run

508
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:36,660
Right, this is happening very very slowly and always will happen very very slowly. It doesn't happen quickly

509
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,300
number two hire the dutch

510
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:43,220
Right 25 of holland is below sea level

511
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:46,180
And they're growing most of their food there

512
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:52,180
On this land that is below sea level. It is not difficult to build dykes

513
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,820
around pieces of land

514
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,220
Especially if the land is steep

515
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,740
Sorry, especially if the land is flat

516
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:05,060
You can save a lot of land by building a foot of dyke or two

517
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,780
If the land is steep

518
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:10,260
You have to decide whether it's worth it or not

519
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:15,780
To build a wall because you're only going to lose a small amount of land if it's coming steep out of the water

520
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:21,380
So those are the basic situations the sea level has always been rising and falling

521
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:25,940
We should not weep because we happen to be victims to this

522
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:29,220
eternal factor in the earth's

523
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,380
climate

524
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,900
and sea level

525
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:39,140
Right the earth sea level has been 40 meters higher than it is today in the past and it's been

526
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,780
100 meters lower

527
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,740
So it goes up and down

528
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:50,980
But if you look at the islands at the equator in indonesia, which are made of limestone from ancient coral reefs

529
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:55,380
They're all undercut sometimes up to 12 feet

530
00:41:56,340 --> 00:42:00,500
Undercut they've got this angle undercut. They look like mushrooms, right?

531
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:03,700
You may have seen them in photographs. Vietnam has them too

532
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:10,740
They're all through that part of the world where the islands are made of limestone, which is more erodible than granite by waves

533
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,940
now

534
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:18,260
If if the sea was constantly rising for the last 10 000 years or whatever

535
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:25,700
Because it stopped rising pretty much around 7 000 years ago when the glaciers melted coming out of the last glaciation

536
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:29,780
The most recent glaciation. It's not necessarily the final one

537
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:35,220
As people think the last glaciation means the final glaciation. It just means the more recent

538
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:39,780
Yes, the most recent one of 45 that have occurred in the Pleistocene

539
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:43,860
So we have no guarantee that anything is going to change

540
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:50,660
Another one should be here in 80 000 years according to the last million years of cycles all which is

541
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:54,740
Thoroughly documented by ice cores from Antarctica

542
00:42:55,860 --> 00:43:00,180
So this sea level rise and up and down has been happening forever

543
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:04,420
And people in the last 10 000 years have adjusted to it

544
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:09,940
It's not going to like they're they're they're making it seem as though it will be a flood

545
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,580
Like an inundation, right?

546
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:15,220
That's the climate emergency

547
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:19,060
Scenario that all of a sudden our houses will be under water

548
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,700
It's not going to work that way

549
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:27,540
And that's why Obama is perfectly happy to buy a 14 million dollar house right on the ocean

550
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:30,260
in Cape Cod

551
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:32,260
Because he also knows this

552
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:34,820
That he's safe there

553
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,980
there's some inland

554
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,300
harbors in the uk

555
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:41,140
isn't there and there's some

556
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:43,140
Ruins of of roman

557
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:48,100
Shipping places that are actually miles inland from when the sea level was higher

558
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:54,180
Precisely and that was 2 000 years ago when the romans built docks on all across the south of britain

559
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,380
And uh lewis

560
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:59,380
You know where lewis is no

561
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:02,340
Well, it's one of those castle towns

562
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:05,700
On a river that flows south

563
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,540
It's way inland

564
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:09,300
It was on the sea

565
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,380
Also, there's a place in france

566
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:14,580
Called something sir lemare

567
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:16,340
it's like

568
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:19,620
Many many kilometers from the sea today. It used to be a harbor

569
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,420
so it appears as though

570
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:25,380
The sea level is lower today

571
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:27,780
And that would be worldwide

572
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:29,940
than it was 2 000 years ago

573
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,420
and

574
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:37,460
That is because the world was warmer 2000 years ago during the roman warm period

575
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:39,780
That's why they have a name for it

576
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:45,060
Because it was the roman warm period and in the roman warm period 2000 years ago

577
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:47,620
It was warmer than it is today

578
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:51,540
In addition during the medieval warm period 1000 years ago

579
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:57,300
Interestingly a thousand years a thousand years a thousand years. This has been the trend

580
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:01,940
There was also a thing called the minoan warm period before the roman warm period

581
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:07,300
The earth has been cooling for 6 000 years net cooling

582
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:10,900
We are in a slight upward tick now. It's just an upward tick in

583
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:14,980
A downward movement. Do you think that we've got further to go down?

584
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:18,420
Yes, 80 000 years further

585
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:22,980
The malankovitch cycle so 100 000 years so you think that

586
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:24,580
realistically

587
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:26,580
We are seeing this upward tick

588
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:30,900
What has happened is it has coincided with an increase of releasing carbon dioxide

589
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:36,500
Which has led some scientists to associate the increasing temperature with the increase in carbon dioxide

590
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:43,060
Which justifies blaming it on humans, but that if you were to roll it forward by another

591
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:45,940
500 years

592
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:50,420
You are going to see the crest of that thousand year cycle actually

593
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:52,900
diminish

594
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:56,260
And we're going to start to cool again and then cool again to a lower level

595
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:59,540
Than we would have seen previously at the previous low

596
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:01,860
You got it

597
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:06,180
If things continue on the same pattern they have for the last 6000 years

598
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:11,220
Which is typical of an interglacial period through the Antarctic ice cores

599
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:18,660
We have a really good picture of the last 800 000 years and now they're starting to go back more than a million years

600
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:22,740
Into the times when there was a 41 000 year cycle

601
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:27,780
Right now we only have really good information for the 100 000 year cycles

602
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:33,540
Especially going back through four of them. They all have names. The previous one was the emion

603
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:38,020
I'm forgetting the other two right now, but they have names on a chart

604
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:41,620
And they were a hundred thousand years apart

605
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,900
In quite perfect synchronization

606
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,940
We know the co2 levels and the temperature

607
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:52,420
At the Antarctic during those cycles because we can measure

608
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:58,260
proxy measurements of isotopes and actually the co2 is measured directly from bubbles in the ice

609
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:00,260
down

610
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:02,260
400 000 years in ice

611
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:05,300
And so we've got that and we know

612
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:08,100
that the interglacial periods

613
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:10,660
come out in

614
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:12,660
10 000 years

615
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:18,740
Whereas and then there's a 10 000 year these these are not all equal exactly right, but approximately

616
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:21,300
10 000 year interglacial period

617
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:27,540
Where the temperature remains higher for a period of time and then a gradual 80 000 year

618
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:30,580
Decline into the next major glaciation

619
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:37,700
So it appears as though and the and the interglacial periods are virtually always warmer at the very beginning

620
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:40,340
Of them in other words as you come out

621
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:42,500
Of the previous

622
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,420
glaciation

623
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:46,100
It goes up

624
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:49,700
To what we call the Holocene climatic optimum

625
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,500
Meaning it was warmer then

626
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:54,660
For the first 6 000 years

627
00:47:55,300 --> 00:48:01,780
Of the Holocene interglacial period and since then it has been cooling. This is well documented the graphs are in my book

628
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:04,260
They're from Iceland and Antarctic ice cores

629
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:11,300
And they're also from marine sediments marine sediments can take you back half a billion years

630
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:15,460
Because stuff has been falling on the bottom of the sea from all the life in the ocean

631
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:19,540
And the stuff and the sediments flowing into the ocean

632
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:26,660
In addition so the life that dies falls to the bottom and is embedded in the sediments that come from the land

633
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:33,300
And that record is in layers and we can date all of that with radioactive techniques

634
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:34,820
So

635
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:36,420
We've got that

636
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:39,220
What do people mean when they say that we've got 50 harvests left?

637
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:45,300
Is that like 50 years of crops apparently yeah, I think so

638
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:48,900
I don't know why they wouldn't just say 50 years of crops as opposed to 50 harvests because

639
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:53,540
That's just confused me but yeah, let's call it 50 years of crops left. What do they mean? Is that

640
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:58,100
Something to do with soil microbiome stuff or biome stuff and virum stuff

641
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:02,340
No, it's it's simply a cult doomsday prediction

642
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:04,660
Is what it is

643
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:07,300
They have absolutely no reason to say that

644
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:10,020
Topsoil degradation none of this

645
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:15,940
Oh, yeah topsoil degradation. It's happening everywhere. No, we're our farming methods are

646
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:20,820
So improved now that soil conservation is so improved now

647
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:28,100
That we're not losing soil like they say we are and yes soil gets washed into the sea by rivers, right?

648
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:33,540
New soil is created. It's not as if soil creation has ended

649
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:38,020
And people think that trees use dirt to make themselves

650
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:43,060
And therefore if you take the trees away over and over and over again by harvesting them

651
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:48,420
The soil will eventually go away, right? No, the soil is made by the bloody trees

652
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:53,620
That's how soil gets there if there was no trees that would be rocks there no soil

653
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,940
Soil doesn't just happen by itself

654
00:49:56,340 --> 00:50:00,660
It happens because of the leaves falling and the branches falling on the ground and decaying

655
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:03,300
And some of it turns into soil

656
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:08,100
soil forming processes was the beginning of ecology in the steps in the ukraine

657
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:15,220
Studying the grasslands of the ukraine, which are very productive deep churnizem soils have been created by grass

658
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:20,100
Doesn't it's not just trees that make dirt. It's all plants

659
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:22,740
make dirt and

660
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:29,540
When you look at a tree and you see this huge say at a big mature tree you see this huge solid thing

661
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:34,900
It's hard to believe that it's 99% made from air and water

662
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:43,700
Right the carbon and the hydrogen and the oxygen in that tree, which is over 99% of that tree's biomass

663
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:48,260
Came from carbon dioxide and H2O water

664
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:54,980
That's what made it trees are basically carbohydrates. So are we except for our bones

665
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:58,660
And so

666
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:02,660
The knowledge of of life is so poor

667
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:09,700
Science has progressed so far and yet the average person's knowledge of science has degraded

668
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:12,260
Because they're being told all these lies

669
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:17,700
That carbon dioxide is poison when in fact it is the primary food for all life

670
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:20,660
And there isn't enough of it right now

671
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:25,460
And there certainly wasn't enough of it when we first started putting some back

672
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:32,180
It's important to note that all the carbon that we are releasing was made by life

673
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:39,140
In the form of fossil fuels and much more importantly in the form of carbonaceous rocks

674
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:45,700
Now have you heard of carbonaceous rocks? I have not of course you have it's called limestone

675
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:49,620
Yes, and limestone is what we make cement with

676
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:52,820
And limestone is calcium carbonate

677
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,860
It is a carbonaceous rock

678
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:59,300
The carbon in limestone came from co2 in the ocean

679
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:02,580
And the co2 in the ocean came from the air

680
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:06,020
So as

681
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:11,140
The shelled creatures evolved what we call the marine calcifying species

682
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:15,300
All life in the sea was microscopic

683
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:18,100
Invisible and unicellular

684
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:22,340
Until about 600 570 600 million years ago

685
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:25,620
Then the Cambrian explosion occurred

686
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:30,420
Which was the advent of multicellular life in the sea

687
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:33,460
And large creatures this big

688
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:36,580
Came into being if you read

689
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:39,380
Stephen

690
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:41,540
ghouls

691
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:44,660
Book a wonderful life. You will see the history

692
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:48,820
Of early life as discovered through the Burgess Shale

693
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:55,300
Which is a fossil deposit in the rocky mountains at Yoho national park in canada the chinese have a parallel one

694
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:58,580
Where soft bodied organisms were preserved

695
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:02,260
That because most fossils are bones or shells

696
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:04,820
Because they were hard parts

697
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:08,020
And they could be preserved more easily soft parts would normally decay

698
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:13,620
But because of mudslides which immediately ended oxygen exposure

699
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:19,300
Ancient creatures that were only soft like jellyfish

700
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:21,860
Were preserved as fossils

701
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:25,940
So there's a record of these species evolution in the early times of the Cambrian

702
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:31,780
At a certain point many different species somehow from a common thread

703
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:36,820
Developed the ability to combine calcium and carbon dioxide

704
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:39,620
calcium like sodium and

705
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:41,700
potassium is in the salts in the sea

706
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,340
And

707
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:47,700
Combined calcium with carbon dioxide to make calcium carbonate

708
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:49,940
to form shells

709
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:57,540
Armor plating around their soft bodies like oysters and mussels and crabs and barnacles and shrimp

710
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:04,020
And tiny coccolithophores, which are a plant phytoplankton and a little bit larger for eminifera, which are about

711
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:07,540
They're an animal they're about the size of a very tiny grain of sand

712
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:11,380
And they are all marine calcifying species

713
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:13,780
coral reefs are actually

714
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:20,260
The predominant one which is about 50 of all the calcification going on in the world and was much more before

715
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:26,500
When coral reefs were much more widely spread when the earth was warmer. They've been reduced to basically

716
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:30,980
Small places where the ocean is still warm enough

717
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:35,780
For the high biodiversity of corals the particularly indonesian coral triangle

718
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:37,620
and so

719
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:39,140
today

720
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:44,740
We have a situation where these coral species and other calcifying species are still

721
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:49,540
Using the carbon dioxide out of the ocean and it's raining down on the bottom

722
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:55,700
As dead shells right as shells from dead creatures and that has built up and formed all of the

723
00:54:56,500 --> 00:55:01,460
All of the limestone in the world over the years and that's where most of the carbon dioxide has gone

724
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:06,020
90 approximately only about 10 of it has gone into fossil fuels

725
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:10,980
Now the fossil fuels are also the result of forest being buried and turned into coal

726
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:16,900
Of species sinking to the bottom the the soft parts of species turning into oil and gas

727
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:22,180
In and now we find them on the land in places like texas, which was once a sea bottom

728
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:25,140
and and the fracking

729
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:28,500
Deposits all were at one time a sea bottom

730
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:33,540
Whereas the coal deposits were a terrestrial environment where forests

731
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:39,060
But all of the fossil fuels were made with photosynthesis. They were all created by solar energy

732
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:44,180
They were all created by carbon dioxide being drawn out of the atmosphere and locked away

733
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:50,420
For hundreds of millions of years where the plants on the land and in the sea could no longer use it because it was gone

734
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:54,180
Into these locked up sediments. They call it sequestration

735
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:58,500
Or sequestered carbon it is out of the cycle

736
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:02,020
That's why co2 came down to such a low level

737
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:07,300
At the last glaciation when the oceans cooled and pulled it out of the atmosphere to 180

738
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:10,180
Which is 30 parts per million above the death of plants

739
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:13,860
Plants don't just need co2. Just like us

740
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:18,100
They need a certain level of co2 just like we need a certain level of oxygen

741
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:22,100
If you have an an atmosphere with 5% oxygen you die

742
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:25,060
Actually, you die at 10% oxygen

743
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:29,940
I think it's even higher than that whereas oxygen is around 20% in the atmosphere

744
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:32,580
But you go up to the top amount Everest

745
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:37,620
And you've got to be a sherpa who's been doing it for their whole life before you can breathe up there

746
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:39,940
And successfully live

747
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:43,460
So that these are true true isms about life

748
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:49,700
That they need a certain level of their essential nutrients and carbon dioxide being the key

749
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:51,860
Essential nutrient for all plants

750
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:57,540
They need it at one one third one fifty and they start to die

751
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:04,020
And it is believed that during some of the last major glaciations because of ash layers that are associated

752
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:10,340
With the peak of those glaciations that high altitude plants did all die and burn

753
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:13,060
Because they were dried out

754
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:18,260
And that would be because when you run when you the higher you go the thinner the air gets

755
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:22,900
So even though co2 is still at the same parts per million

756
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:26,020
Compared to the other gases. It's more dispersed

757
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:30,260
And therefore more difficult for plants to obtain that

758
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:36,740
Everything i'm saying is thoroughly documented on the internet

759
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:41,300
The and the most important point is that no scientist

760
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:44,980
Who actually wanted to retain any credibility?

761
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:53,140
Would claim that the correlation between rising co2 and rising temperature at this very tiny piece of time

762
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:56,020
Is proof of causation

763
00:57:57,220 --> 00:58:00,660
Right correlation is not proof of causation

764
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:04,260
Correlation just means two things are going in the same direction

765
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:10,180
And very often the reason they are is because of a third common factor and let me give you an example

766
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:16,260
The relationship between ice cream consumption and shark attacks

767
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:20,740
They are perfectly correlated

768
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:26,740
When ice cream consumption goes up shark attacks go up ice cream consumption goes down

769
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:30,340
Shark attacks go down. It's a perfect annual cycle

770
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:38,820
Do ice cream consumptions cause shark attacks? No. Do shark attacks cause ice cream consumption? No

771
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:45,540
This is a correlation which is not an example of causation because temperature

772
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:50,740
A third factor is the cause of both of them going in the same cycle

773
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:54,420
When the temperature gets warm people go to the beach

774
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:58,820
Eat an ice cream and go swimming and some of them get attacked by a shark

775
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:01,540
In the winter neither happens

776
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:08,500
So this is correlation is far more common than causation and there's a a website called

777
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:14,020
Something correlations spurious correlations. Yeah, that one. It's very very good

778
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, like Nicholas Cage

779
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:20,420
Correlated with the number of people that die by being caught up in their bedding every year

780
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:24,900
There's a statistically significant. All right, so what's the third? What do you think is the third?

781
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:30,500
Factor in that case. Is there something that there doesn't have to be one? Yep

782
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:33,860
There doesn't have to it's just that they're both right

783
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:39,060
There could be a a separate factor causing temperature to change and a separate factor

784
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:44,260
Causing co2 to change and the fact that they're both going up at this time

785
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,500
But they're not going up in sync

786
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:52,500
If you look at there's one graph in in my book that shows that in this interglacial period

787
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:58,900
We came before humans started emitting we came to a point where co2 was at 280

788
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:03,700
And temperature was at a certain point. I don't know what exact Celsius it was

789
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:10,580
And then suddenly co2 just shoots up off the chart if you put it in a hundred thousand years graph

790
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:13,460
this little bit of time right now

791
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:21,460
150 years and really only the last 60 or 70 where it's been substantial 60 years of

792
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:24,580
Radical increase in co2. I won't

793
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:30,420
You know say that's wrong. It is a radical increase. We don't need to do it this quickly

794
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:32,580
And that is why in my book

795
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:37,780
I make it very clear that reducing fossil fuel consumption would be an excellent strategy

796
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:42,100
If you had something reliable cost effective to replace it with

797
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:44,980
Right and that is nuclear energy

798
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:50,180
With nuclear energy we could easily take out half the fossil fuels being used today

799
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:55,780
Not because of climate change, but because they're precious and should be conserved because they're

800
01:00:56,340 --> 01:01:02,580
Non-renewable they don't they're not being made as quickly as we're using them by orders of magnitude

801
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:08,740
Right, so we should be conserving fossil fuels for the essential things like flying airplanes

802
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:12,020
It's not easy to fly an airplane with anything else

803
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:20,020
Besides a liquid fuel and liquid fuels are hard to come by as our gaseous ones like methane natural gas

804
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:22,260
so

805
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:24,020
electricity

806
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:27,860
Is mostly being made by fossil fuels today not just in china

807
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:33,780
It's only in france that more than 50 of the electricity is being made by nuclear energy

808
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:40,180
And they they diss france for this and they hold up germany as a shining example of green

809
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:45,700
When in fact germany is emitting nearly two times the co2 per capita of france

810
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:50,020
And their only reason france is emitting less co2 is because of nuclear energy

811
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:52,820
Why is the world so averse to nuclear energy?

812
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:55,060
Because they're idiots

813
01:01:55,060 --> 01:02:00,180
And they're they're brainwashed and whatever else, right? I have nothing but

814
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:03,300
Contempt for people who just

815
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:09,300
Reject nuclear energy when almost no one has ever been killed by it except chernobyl

816
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:13,060
Which was a stupid reactor design that the russians made

817
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:18,580
From their plutonium production reactors to make nuclear weapons. They just cookie-cuttered the same

818
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:21,140
cheap reactor all across

819
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:25,940
The former soviet union all of which have been shut down in any of the former satellites

820
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:29,140
They still have 10 running eight or 10 running in

821
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:33,540
In russia, but they have modified them so that can't happen again

822
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:40,100
They should have done that in the first place because they had a negative void coefficient or a positive void coefficient

823
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:42,980
I never get them right, but one is good and the other is bad

824
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:44,820
and

825
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:49,140
Their reactor was a design that could theoretically

826
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:51,780
Go critical in other words

827
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:53,940
Become a nuclear bomb

828
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,700
And that a slow one

829
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:57,700
That was a slow nuclear bomb that explosion

830
01:02:57,780 --> 01:02:59,780
They happened faster in real nuclear bombs

831
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:07,860
And do more damage than that one did but it blew a 2000 ton lid off itself a concrete lid and then burned because they had a huge

832
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:11,780
Carbon moderator in there. That was 2000 tons or something

833
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:15,620
To I mean there's big numbers involved in Chernobyl

834
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:19,540
And that burnt for 10 days while firefighters tried to put it out spewing

835
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:22,500
More and more radiation into the atmosphere the whole time

836
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:27,060
Whereas Three Mile Island wasn't even worth talking about

837
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:33,140
It was a bad accident to cord a core meltdown, but it didn't cause any damage to anything or any one

838
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:40,660
And no one died in Fukushima from radiation and no one will because no one received a sufficient dose to cause any harm

839
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:45,940
And this is confirmed by the radioactive effects research foundation in Hiroshima and Nagasaki

840
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:51,380
Formed after the second world war by macArthur and the japanese to study the life history

841
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:57,940
Of people who were exposed to the radiation and survived aren't there some tuna or some fish in the sea

842
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:04,260
Who are showing higher levels of radiation and ten eyes to yes ten eyes imagine that

843
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:07,060
No, there are not

844
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:09,060
there's higher levels means

845
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:13,140
Infantesimal higher levels if that's what they mean

846
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:20,020
They did have a ban on fishing in the region because a lot of liquid was going into the water that was contaminated as they say

847
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:24,980
Had radioactive substances in it. There are radioactive substances in you and me

848
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:28,820
Potassium 40 in particular if you eat a banana

849
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:35,060
Which is radioactive we have radiation stuff wasn't from a banana was it that was from something much more dangerous

850
01:04:35,060 --> 01:04:43,380
Well, what do you mean what was more they nuclear reactors are not inherently dangerous they are if you eat them

851
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:49,620
Yeah, but we we we don't eat them and nobody ate anything from Fukushima because they stopped

852
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:52,180
Taking crops from the land nearby

853
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:59,620
I mean they took the Fukushima was one of the stupidest accidents that ever occurred in the world and the japanese are so insular

854
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:04,900
In their culture that they did not take the the lessons that were learned

855
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:07,300
From other accidents that occurred

856
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:13,700
They just didn't and the the difference in culture can be explained this way in the united states or britain

857
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:16,260
When a reactor has a problem

858
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:20,900
The operator phones the prime minister and tells him what the problem is and what he's doing to try to fix it

859
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:25,620
In japan the operator phones the president asks the president what he should do

860
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:28,820
Right because he's the president

861
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:34,100
And he doesn't know what the heck to do so those three explosions that happened one day after another i think

862
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:40,260
Approximately at Fukushima could all have easily been prevented even after the meltdowns occurred

863
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:46,340
Because they were hydrogen explosions people think those were explosions in the reactor

864
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:54,020
They weren't they were explosions of hydrogen gas that was not released as it should have been to prevent it from becoming concentrated at eight percent

865
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:56,340
hydrogen almost spontaneously

866
01:05:56,580 --> 01:06:00,180
Ignites with any spark and causes a huge explosion

867
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:02,420
So and then they evacuated

868
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:11,380
All the people even though they were not subject to sufficient radiation to require evacuation and over 2000 people died from the evacuation

869
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:20,580
Because they evacuated five intensive care wards into gymnasiums in other communities where they did not have the facilities to keep them alive

870
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:24,340
So that that's the kind of overreaction

871
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:29,060
That happened to in Fukushima, which was a bad accident

872
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:36,740
It was a huge industrial accident that it did not cause death what caused death of almost 20 000 people was the tsunami

873
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:39,700
And I saw on cnn

874
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:44,580
A headline written across the screen during the Fukushima disaster

875
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:48,900
Which said nuclear crisis deepens

876
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:51,700
As bodies wash ashore

877
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:53,940
That's what it said

878
01:06:55,540 --> 01:07:00,420
And that was to me the beginning of fake news all the way when they started showing

879
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:04,500
smog and calling it carbon dioxide basically

880
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:06,980
And showing backlit

881
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:09,220
chimneys of factories with black

882
01:07:10,020 --> 01:07:16,180
smoke coming out of them supposedly but no it was water vapor and that's what water vapor looks like when you backlight it

883
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:18,900
so the

884
01:07:19,780 --> 01:07:22,500
And you know and the same with the inbreeding polar bears

885
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:27,060
I mean they are just making up one story after another now and floating it in the media

886
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:30,340
And it all comes back to the fact that the politicians

887
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:36,580
Are funding the scientists to give them what they want, which is something that they can instill fear

888
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:42,580
And guilt into the population about in order to have power

889
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:48,660
And then the media and the activists are the bullhorn right the megaphone

890
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:53,700
That puts that into just a giant global story and nothing else matters

891
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:57,940
The truth doesn't matter one bit anymore in this discussion

892
01:07:58,260 --> 01:08:02,580
What about the people that say we're seeing the beginning of the next big extinction event?

893
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:07,460
It's so stupid

894
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:10,420
We're not seeing the beginning of the next big extinction event

895
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:15,220
Okay, if a big extinction event was happening and it was being documented

896
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:20,820
I could get it but read the chapter in my book on extinction where I appeared before

897
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:23,700
a committee of the u.s. House of Congress

898
01:08:24,820 --> 01:08:28,340
With three people there claiming to be united nation scientists

899
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:31,460
Saying that yes

900
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:40,180
We only know of 1.7 plus million species which have been identified named photographed written up, etc

901
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:44,100
But there are very likely 8.7 million species

902
01:08:45,220 --> 01:08:47,220
That's what they said

903
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:52,580
There's probably 8.7 million species and this is our best estimate

904
01:08:54,020 --> 01:08:56,020
Where did they get that estimate?

905
01:08:56,180 --> 01:09:00,980
In air there's no way you can turn 1.1.7 into 8.7

906
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:05,300
Without having any actual observation of any real thing

907
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:08,900
So they were saying there's about 7 million

908
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:17,300
Unreal species that we don't know about and then they say and a million of those will go extinct in the next few decades

909
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:21,540
Right, how many of the how many of the observed creatures?

910
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:24,180
Have they seen go extinct?

911
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:32,340
An ever decreasing number as humans in around 1920 when the passenger pigeon became extinct

912
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:34,820
suddenly

913
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:38,660
The general population took an interest in the issue of extinction

914
01:09:39,460 --> 01:09:42,420
Prior to that which wasn't very long ago 100 years

915
01:09:43,540 --> 01:09:47,700
Nobody cared about extinction. They thought it was a normal thing except a few naturalists who

916
01:09:48,580 --> 01:09:54,500
Bemoaned the extinction of the dodo bird or other species that went extinct as a result of human activity

917
01:09:55,380 --> 01:09:58,900
And most people don't realize that the the main cause

918
01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:03,140
Of species extinction is not hunting

919
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:06,500
Right it it is actually agriculture

920
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:12,100
And the changing of habitats so that is why most

921
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:20,100
Species recovery programs are based on habitat and making sure that there's a place for these species to exist

922
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:22,340
That's key

923
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:28,420
but we have not like overrun 90 percent of the world's habitat and much of the

924
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:32,180
Area that we are using especially for forestry

925
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:36,900
Is perfectly suitable for most of the species that always lived in the forests

926
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:38,900
agriculture is different

927
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:43,780
Agriculture creates a monoculture on purpose and that's pretty hard to get away from

928
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:49,060
People who preach that you should have 17 different species of plants growing on the same plot of land

929
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:53,060
I'd like to see them do it successfully. It's not possible

930
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:58,100
So they the farmer wants to get rid of every insect every animal

931
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:04,020
You know everything other than every other plant all other all other plants are weeds

932
01:11:04,980 --> 01:11:06,340
in this case

933
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:09,380
And so agriculture is is where you have to really

934
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:16,820
Look at what you're doing in the landscape and make sure that in that landscape and it usually happens naturally if you fly across the

935
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:22,100
Whole agricultural area of the united states. You see lots of forest

936
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:27,540
Burst among the agricultural land because and and in europe too

937
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:29,940
I mean most people don't realize that

938
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:35,300
200 years ago 250 years ago less than 10 percent of europe remained forested

939
01:11:35,780 --> 01:11:38,900
Because the trees were being used for everything to do with fuel

940
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:44,500
They were being used to heat all the buildings to to smelt all the iron and copper to do the glass works

941
01:11:45,140 --> 01:11:49,620
And steam engines everything was fueled by wood and all the building of everything

942
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:55,780
So forests started to disappear in central europe initially and then spreading out over the whole of europe

943
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:59,060
The first time in the history of humans where forests

944
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:03,460
Were disappearing if we were cutting them faster than they were growing back

945
01:12:03,860 --> 01:12:09,780
That's why agriculture was invented 10 000 years ago and forestry wasn't invented until about 1750

946
01:12:10,180 --> 01:12:14,180
In central europe because they realized they had to start planting some trees

947
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:17,620
And then silviculture otherwise known as

948
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:24,500
As as forestry scientific forestry came into being and now there's 43 forest cover in europe

949
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:28,100
Well speaking of trees. I thought I thought the amazon rainforest was wrecked

950
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:31,540
10 percent of it has been modified

951
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:35,460
That's quite a lot that could be quite a bit. It's a fair big forest, isn't it?

952
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:38,900
It's a huge forest and it's not in any way endangered

953
01:12:39,940 --> 01:12:45,700
The the problem with the you know my book is titled fake invisible catastrophes and threats of doom for a reason

954
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:47,700
I put the word invisible in there

955
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:53,380
Because to most people the amazon is invisible they show you a picture of a fire that takes up the whole screen

956
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:55,700
Right, it might be about 10 feet

957
01:12:56,020 --> 01:13:01,700
Of the you know of the amazon which is almost as big as the continental united states brazil itself

958
01:13:02,180 --> 01:13:06,500
Is almost as big as the continental united states and amazon is a huge part of brazil

959
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:09,620
And there are parts of the amazon

960
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:12,260
That have been developed

961
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:14,260
But most of it is intact

962
01:13:14,740 --> 01:13:21,140
And even where it's been developed it is only small areas if you just look at a satellite photograph of it

963
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:24,180
You can see it. I've flown over it in an airplane at

964
01:13:24,660 --> 01:13:29,460
Fairly low elevation and you go for five hours and you hardly see any people

965
01:13:30,020 --> 01:13:32,900
It's called a human desert by people but even

966
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:38,260
You know the the leader of brazil now is under attack over the amazon

967
01:13:39,140 --> 01:13:41,140
from the left

968
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:48,340
And one of the reasons you can get away with that is almost no one in brazil has ever been to the amazon even though it's in their own country

969
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:51,780
People don't go there. What would you do there?

970
01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:58,580
It's got manouse, which is basically a manufacturing hub for electronics. So it's a sort of a

971
01:13:59,380 --> 01:14:01,380
Tax-free zone of some kind

972
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:07,220
You've got bay lamb at the mouth of the river, which is i've been to that city. It's not very interesting

973
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:11,700
It's just a city at the mouth of the amazon and there's not much else to do there

974
01:14:12,260 --> 01:14:14,260
You can go on a boat up and down the river

975
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:20,420
Then you see all you see is trees the whole way and the amazon

976
01:14:20,980 --> 01:14:25,620
Is 300 miles wide during the flood period. It will never have a bridge over it

977
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:28,420
It doesn't have a road anymore

978
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:35,540
Because the road the plants grew up through the pavement and destroyed the road within 10 years when they did build one to manouse

979
01:14:35,620 --> 01:14:40,660
And i'm going to guess that if we continue to increase the concentration of carbon dioxide that's just going to happen quicker

980
01:14:42,020 --> 01:14:49,860
Yes, the amazon is is growing faster, but interestingly it's the drier places that benefit most from increased co2

981
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:51,700
because

982
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:56,180
Increase co2 has two effects one more co2 for growth

983
01:14:57,060 --> 01:14:58,180
like

984
01:14:58,180 --> 01:14:59,620
I'll give you the second one in a minute

985
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:05,380
But first i digress to say that i used to laugh at people who said their plants grew better when they talked to them

986
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:10,500
As if plants have ears and can hear you and are empathetic or whatever

987
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:13,140
And i saw i sort of chuckled at that

988
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:20,580
Then i realized that when you're talking to your plants you're breathing 40 000 parts per million co2 on them

989
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:22,340
That's our breath

990
01:15:22,340 --> 01:15:25,300
Is 100 times the level it is in the air

991
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:32,100
So you're basically breathing super concentrated fertilizer onto your plants when you're talking to them

992
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:39,460
And they do grow better because of that because they would like to have more co2 than exists in the natural world today

993
01:15:40,180 --> 01:15:46,900
The second thing that increased co2 does is it makes most plants more efficient with water

994
01:15:47,780 --> 01:15:54,100
Because now it's easier for them to get the carbon dioxide they need because it's more concentrated in the atmosphere

995
01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:59,380
And therefore they don't need to make as many holes in the bottom of their leaves. They're called stomata

996
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:07,300
It's where they take in the air with the co2 in it, but it's also where they lose water through transpiration

997
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:11,540
So the fewer of those holes there are the less water they lose

998
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:18,900
Therefore the more efficient they become with water and gives them ability to survive in places that have less water than they could before

999
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:26,180
That's why trees are marching out onto grasslands in many parts of the world the southwest of the us for example and australia

1000
01:16:26,820 --> 01:16:28,820
the very eastern part

1001
01:16:29,540 --> 01:16:30,660
of

1002
01:16:30,660 --> 01:16:34,180
Sorry the very western part of australia western australia as it's known

1003
01:16:34,820 --> 01:16:38,260
Is the driest part of australia the nalabar desert is there too

1004
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:40,740
Which doesn't have much of anything growing on it because it's so dry

1005
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:44,420
But in the in the west like around perth and down to albany

1006
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:48,900
The the trees are growing much faster now and so are the crops because

1007
01:16:50,180 --> 01:16:52,260
You know if if you're a farmer

1008
01:16:53,060 --> 01:17:01,140
Today and you are giving your plants all the water and all the fertilizer they need the mineral food

1009
01:17:01,940 --> 01:17:07,860
The limiting factor to the plant's growth is carbon dioxide because of how low it is in the atmosphere even today

1010
01:17:08,580 --> 01:17:12,740
And the the proof is in the pudding here because all commercial greenhouse growers

1011
01:17:13,540 --> 01:17:15,140
in the world

1012
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:19,300
Inject carbon dioxide into their greenhouses because they haven't enclosed space

1013
01:17:19,780 --> 01:17:25,620
Where they can increase the level of co2 and they generally go up to between 800 and 1200 ppm

1014
01:17:26,420 --> 01:17:30,900
Which even above that the plants grow faster, but there's a curve because economics is involved

1015
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:35,300
They have to buy the co2 so at this level at right somewhere in the curve

1016
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:42,580
They say okay 1200 is optimum for us because above that buying more co2 has an ever decreasing increase in yield

1017
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:46,180
And so 1200 works really well in greenhouses

1018
01:17:46,180 --> 01:17:51,700
That's four times sorry three times what it is today in the global atmosphere and that is

1019
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:54,260
We should not even be concerned

1020
01:17:54,580 --> 01:17:57,940
Until co2 gets up to 20 000 ppm

1021
01:17:58,580 --> 01:18:02,580
Because that's what submariners survive in for three months under water

1022
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:11,700
and the the the people who uh had the trouble on apollo 13 where the co2 was building up it went up to at least 20 000 in there

1023
01:18:12,340 --> 01:18:14,580
See we our breath is 40 000

1024
01:18:14,980 --> 01:18:18,820
We have 40 000 ppm co2 in our lungs

1025
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:22,260
Just before we breathe out. I don't want to be breathing that in though

1026
01:18:23,620 --> 01:18:25,140
Yes, you do

1027
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:29,140
But the same air that I breathe that well in that case you can no no just once just once

1028
01:18:29,220 --> 01:18:33,540
Yeah, yeah, but you don't want to be a closed system of breathing that back in when you put your mask on

1029
01:18:34,020 --> 01:18:37,940
You are breathing a significant portion of the air. You just breathed out back in again

1030
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:39,940
so

1031
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:46,980
We we can survive at a whole different bunch of levels of co2 just fine and plants are happy with it at

1032
01:18:47,540 --> 01:18:51,540
10000 ppm or they wouldn't be here because that's what it was back

1033
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:57,540
500 million years ago one of the things that I decided to fact check you on or internet check you on

1034
01:18:58,020 --> 01:19:00,900
was photos of the great pacific garbage patch

1035
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:04,660
And photos of birds with plastic inside of their stomachs

1036
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:11,380
Now I'd seen these floating around on the internet and when I was reading your book and listening to you

1037
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:15,780
I found that you'd said try and find me a photo of a big patch of garbage

1038
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:18,260
That doesn't have mountains in the background

1039
01:19:19,220 --> 01:19:22,900
Because in the middle of the pacific there aren't any mountains that are nearby

1040
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:25,460
So if someone was to take a photo of it something that's supposed to be

1041
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:31,780
Didn't someone say it was nearly the size of texas or something like that size of texas and growing faster than anyone ever predicted

1042
01:19:32,020 --> 01:19:34,740
Yes, and I thought well if this thing's so big

1043
01:19:35,380 --> 01:19:36,740
That seems ridiculous

1044
01:19:36,740 --> 01:19:42,180
I'd seen photos of big clumps of plastic floating together bottles and and and stuff

1045
01:19:42,660 --> 01:19:43,460
In the middle of the ocean

1046
01:19:43,460 --> 01:19:49,540
So I did a search and I kept on looking in the background and people have re cropped numbers of different photos

1047
01:19:49,860 --> 01:19:52,180
And twisted them so that they look like they're at different angles

1048
01:19:52,740 --> 01:19:54,740
I thought oh, that's

1049
01:19:54,740 --> 01:19:59,220
That's kind of interesting because I thought I was pretty sure that that was there and then the other thing that you mentioned was

1050
01:19:59,940 --> 01:20:06,580
Birds that birds don't have teeth so the way that they digest their food is actually by putting little stones or nuts into their stomach

1051
01:20:06,580 --> 01:20:09,940
And they kill it and then they use that to grind up the food

1052
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:13,380
And then they eject the little bits of plastic back out

1053
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:16,820
So I thought well I'll have a bit of a read about that and I'll have a look and I'd seen a photo

1054
01:20:16,820 --> 01:20:21,460
It's sort of a carcass of an albatross and it's laid on the floor and it's really just sort of

1055
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:24,100
bones and some feathers

1056
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:28,900
And it's got like a thimble like a full reel of string inside of it and other stuff

1057
01:20:29,140 --> 01:20:32,020
And you'd mentioned that a lot of these might be staged and I thought yeah

1058
01:20:32,420 --> 01:20:37,700
Not a lot of them not a lot of them chris all of them. Okay. I looked and I thought with a skeptical. I was like

1059
01:20:38,820 --> 01:20:45,380
Yeah, I mean that that one does look a bit ridiculous and then a few of the other ones do and I read an article from

1060
01:20:45,940 --> 01:20:47,940
I want to say it was a bbc

1061
01:20:48,340 --> 01:20:50,740
one of david attenborough's documentaries about life or something

1062
01:20:51,540 --> 01:20:56,900
And it's one of the write-ups that's a partner to one of the episodes and the episode you see one of the birds eating plastic

1063
01:20:56,900 --> 01:21:01,540
And I was like, right, okay. Well, maybe they're doing this thing. Maybe they know you don't not in his episodes

1064
01:21:01,540 --> 01:21:06,020
You don't see a bird eating plastic. Oh, it might have been it's definitely a documentary on the bbc

1065
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:10,340
And he's holding up a plastic bag next to a chick in a nest

1066
01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:12,660
Okay, and saying and saying

1067
01:21:12,820 --> 01:21:19,060
Adult birds are feeding plastic to their chicks. There's no pick. I've I've searched the internet thoroughly

1068
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:24,660
He's actually removed one sequence that sequence where he's holding up the plastic bag

1069
01:21:24,660 --> 01:21:27,700
It no longer is available on the internet. I don't know why that's interesting

1070
01:21:27,940 --> 01:21:33,300
Yeah, it why did you say it the first time if about a year ago if sir before I wrote my book

1071
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:35,540
I I think he's on to me

1072
01:21:35,620 --> 01:21:37,620
uh, and

1073
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:43,060
He's he's an absolute liar in many many cases and I've made three of them in the book

1074
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:48,420
One of them is that albatross adults are feeding plastic to their young

1075
01:21:49,060 --> 01:21:55,140
Mistaking it for food greenpeace says the same thing the smithsonian institute in the united states is saying the same thing

1076
01:21:55,620 --> 01:21:57,620
They are pushing this lie

1077
01:21:57,860 --> 01:22:00,340
That albatross can't tell plastic from food

1078
01:22:01,780 --> 01:22:05,540
Sir david attenborough never mentions the word gizzard anywhere

1079
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:08,980
He wrote the bloody secret life of birds book

1080
01:22:09,780 --> 01:22:13,220
He did a ten part series on bbc on birds

1081
01:22:14,020 --> 01:22:19,780
Right and he doesn't know that birds all have gizzards that need to have solid objects in them to grind their food

1082
01:22:19,780 --> 01:22:27,620
Because they have no teeth and therefore have two stomachs all birds every bird in the world. That's why all land birds

1083
01:22:28,660 --> 01:22:33,940
Take pebbles into their stomach and when their chicks are in the nest and can't go and get pebbles for themselves

1084
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:35,940
They put pebbles in their chick

1085
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:38,980
So if you have a more convenient pebble that is made of plastic

1086
01:22:39,460 --> 01:22:41,460
And it's able to do the same job then

1087
01:22:41,780 --> 01:22:47,220
No, the land birds do not feed bits of plastic to their chicks as far as I know because there's plenty of pebbles

1088
01:22:47,780 --> 01:22:51,620
But out in the ocean where birds are actual marine animals that

1089
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:57,060
Nest on rocky islands barren rocky islands where all there is is a bit of grass

1090
01:22:57,540 --> 01:23:05,380
Right, there's no pebbles there either. Yeah, so traditionally their favorite. Well, naturally they feed their chicks squid

1091
01:23:05,780 --> 01:23:07,220
little squid

1092
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:09,300
In those squid is a beak

1093
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:13,940
That beak is retained in the gizzard as part of the digestive aids

1094
01:23:14,580 --> 01:23:19,300
Right, it's like a ball mill in mining where they put steel balls into a mill to grind the ore

1095
01:23:19,460 --> 01:23:23,540
It's exactly the same concept in many ways, but in the in the gizzard

1096
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:31,940
It's a muscular motion where they go like this with their gizzard and grind the food with these solid objects in there to help with it

1097
01:23:32,660 --> 01:23:34,900
And so the other thing they'll take is pumice

1098
01:23:35,700 --> 01:23:41,860
Which is volcanic lava from undersea volcanoes and because it's spongy it floats

1099
01:23:41,940 --> 01:23:45,940
It's got air in it or gases in it. So it floats so little bits of

1100
01:23:46,580 --> 01:23:51,060
Pumice will come to the surface sometimes in huge layers when a undersea volcano goes off

1101
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:53,140
But they're not it's not always there

1102
01:23:53,140 --> 01:23:58,820
So they have to resort them to hard bits of wood and nuts that have dropped off a plant

1103
01:23:59,380 --> 01:24:02,740
In a river or by the seashore and come out in the ocean

1104
01:24:03,140 --> 01:24:06,180
So it they have to work really hard

1105
01:24:06,660 --> 01:24:12,180
To find enough digestive aids that are suitable in size and and hardness

1106
01:24:12,820 --> 01:24:17,460
It's not easy for them. And when plastic started showing up in the ocean 60 years ago

1107
01:24:18,660 --> 01:24:25,460
They started choosing pieces of the right size not plastic bags not cigarette lighters

1108
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:28,660
Not spools of yarn. That's all staged

1109
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:34,020
They don't feed them those kind of things and they're actually they're not feeding the plastic bits

1110
01:24:34,340 --> 01:24:39,220
They're giving it to them to ingest so they can put it in their gizzard. That's where it goes

1111
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:42,180
They know how to decide which goes in which stomach

1112
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:48,740
So the story that I read had this lady explaining about the situation and that the parents she'd used the word feed

1113
01:24:48,740 --> 01:24:52,740
She'd parents would come back and given the chicks these plastic pebbles

1114
01:24:53,060 --> 01:24:55,060
And I can't remember the word that they used

1115
01:24:55,540 --> 01:25:00,820
To describe what happens as they're just about to fly the nest some bird word

1116
01:25:01,380 --> 01:25:03,380
They the bolus

1117
01:25:03,460 --> 01:25:08,580
Maybe they cough up most of the hard objects in there. Yeah

1118
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:14,020
The reason they have so much in their gizzard is because they will digest their food even faster

1119
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:16,900
Then and the parents won't have to feed them for the rest of their lives

1120
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:20,020
Right, so they want them out of the nest as soon as possible

1121
01:25:20,260 --> 01:25:25,780
So they put a lot of plastic which weighs a lot plastic and but plastic is never

1122
01:25:26,340 --> 01:25:33,380
A majority of what's in a young bird's gizzard never like it's shown in those staged photos is like all plastic

1123
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:37,140
What this lady said was just as they were about to leave. I saw them

1124
01:25:37,860 --> 01:25:42,740
Eject the the the plastic back up and throw it back up just as they were about to leave the nest

1125
01:25:42,980 --> 01:25:46,020
And you think it's not just the plastic not just the plastic

1126
01:25:46,020 --> 01:25:49,220
But all the other items they have in there to do the same job

1127
01:25:49,540 --> 01:25:52,260
And it's all plastic is always a minority of it

1128
01:25:52,260 --> 01:25:58,260
And she's got all these plastic bags and big plastic plastic cloths and things that's all staged

1129
01:25:58,340 --> 01:26:01,140
Yeah, well, that's not going in there. It's not going to fit in a small bird. Is it?

1130
01:26:01,220 --> 01:26:04,340
No, well, they're not they're actually quite big because albatrosses are big

1131
01:26:04,740 --> 01:26:06,900
But it's not gonna it's not gonna work

1132
01:26:07,540 --> 01:26:14,020
They only if you see the photo in my book the only photo I know of of a adult albatross

1133
01:26:14,740 --> 01:26:19,700
Giving plastic to its chick you can see it in its beak going into the chicks mouth

1134
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:23,540
And it's all nice little pieces of colored plastic

1135
01:26:24,820 --> 01:26:29,940
That are just the right shape and size. It's not plastic bags. It's not

1136
01:26:30,580 --> 01:26:33,460
Cigarette lighters like they show in the staged pictures

1137
01:26:33,620 --> 01:26:38,420
But when you read that when you read that article what you see is if you didn't know that

1138
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:42,100
The birds needed the plastic to break up food in the stomach

1139
01:26:42,340 --> 01:26:45,940
If you didn't know that that was something that aids them with that digestion

1140
01:26:46,020 --> 01:26:50,340
And that it is common for them to throw up the plastic plus presumably all of the other stuff

1141
01:26:50,420 --> 01:26:52,420
That's been in there helping them to break up their food

1142
01:26:52,580 --> 01:26:55,540
You would read that article and it is it is accurate

1143
01:26:56,020 --> 01:26:59,780
What she says is correct, but the things that have been purposefully omitted

1144
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:05,780
And the understanding about why some of the inclusions have been put in there and why biologically that might still be natural

1145
01:27:06,740 --> 01:27:10,660
That creates a situation and that was the moment I was reading it and I thought

1146
01:27:12,820 --> 01:27:14,660
This really is

1147
01:27:14,660 --> 01:27:18,420
This really is quite sinister. It does feel like it's quite a

1148
01:27:20,020 --> 01:27:22,020
Manipulative way

1149
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:28,740
To tell people what has happened but frame it in such a manner that makes us again hate our own existence

1150
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:31,620
You could say evil

1151
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:33,620
as a synonym of sinister

1152
01:27:34,580 --> 01:27:37,620
And I believe it is because sir david attenborough

1153
01:27:38,180 --> 01:27:42,580
Also lied about the walruses committing suicide due to a lack of ice

1154
01:27:43,460 --> 01:27:48,100
That's the final chapter in my book. They committed suicide. Was this a harry carry thing?

1155
01:27:48,740 --> 01:27:52,500
Yes, they jumped off a cliff to their death in order

1156
01:27:53,780 --> 01:27:57,540
To avoid an attack by 20 polar bears. Oh

1157
01:27:58,100 --> 01:28:01,380
He didn't mention that part and that is well documented

1158
01:28:01,460 --> 01:28:04,820
There are photographs of the bears the people who live in a nearby town

1159
01:28:05,060 --> 01:28:09,860
Know that the reason the walruses left off a cliff was because they were being

1160
01:28:10,340 --> 01:28:13,860
About to be attacked and eaten by polar bears. What was the proposed reason?

1161
01:28:15,380 --> 01:28:18,500
Not enough ice as if you can put those two things together

1162
01:28:18,580 --> 01:28:24,340
It's sort of like polar bears are inbreeding because there isn't enough ice as if those two things are connected somehow

1163
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:31,220
Right and he made it seem as though it was connected that there was because he said the reason the polar bears have come on the land

1164
01:28:32,180 --> 01:28:34,180
and got to a place

1165
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:37,060
Where they could jump off

1166
01:28:37,860 --> 01:28:41,300
They did because there was no ice for them in the sea below

1167
01:28:41,540 --> 01:28:45,700
Which is always the case on the north shore of russia the ice recedes in the summer

1168
01:28:46,340 --> 01:28:50,180
And funny enough he says that the he says the ice is their home

1169
01:28:50,980 --> 01:28:52,980
No, the sea is their home

1170
01:28:53,940 --> 01:28:58,260
That's where the walrus lives and fishes. They don't fish actually

1171
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:01,460
They dig clams on the bottom

1172
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:04,660
And when the ice recedes away from the coast

1173
01:29:05,300 --> 01:29:09,140
And they are coming out of the water to haul out they come on the land

1174
01:29:09,460 --> 01:29:14,900
There's a reason why it is an officially designated walrus sanctuary this piece of land

1175
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:22,180
And he implies that it's unnatural that they are coming on the land because there's not enough ice for them to get onto

1176
01:29:23,140 --> 01:29:26,420
When in fact they cannot exist they are a coastal species

1177
01:29:26,740 --> 01:29:28,740
They cannot exist deep sea

1178
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:33,380
So if the ice recedes to where it's 600 feet deep or 1000 feet deep

1179
01:29:33,860 --> 01:29:35,380
It's no good to them

1180
01:29:35,380 --> 01:29:38,980
Because they are bottom feeders and as I say in my book

1181
01:29:39,220 --> 01:29:46,660
They are bottom feeders much like sir david attenborough and his tv crew on the planet earth or whatever our planet

1182
01:29:47,060 --> 01:29:50,260
right they they too are bottom feeders in this case

1183
01:29:51,140 --> 01:29:56,740
And they are lying because the reason the walruses left to their death

1184
01:29:57,940 --> 01:29:59,460
Fell to their death

1185
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:01,940
They didn't walruses can't actually leap

1186
01:30:02,580 --> 01:30:07,540
But they plummeted to their death because a pack of polar bears was going to eat them

1187
01:30:08,420 --> 01:30:14,100
And instead the polar bears just walked down to where all the dead walruses were and ate them while they're dead

1188
01:30:14,340 --> 01:30:19,140
And i'm sure the walruses would rather be eaten while they were dead than while they were alive

1189
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:25,300
So that's the deal there and he is bald face lying to the whole world about this and he continues to do it

1190
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:27,300
He had people in davos in tears

1191
01:30:28,020 --> 01:30:33,140
Recently telling this story even though he now knows that I have busted him and so has

1192
01:30:33,540 --> 01:30:35,540
Susan crockford the polar bear expert

1193
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:41,300
Who's also an expert in all arctic animals has busted him publicly

1194
01:30:41,780 --> 01:30:45,140
And he sticks to this story because bbc lets him

1195
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:46,980
right

1196
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:51,300
Patrick more ladies and gentlemen fake invisible catastrophes and threats of doom

1197
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:57,460
Will be available on amazon in the links of the show notes below if people want to keep up to date with all of the other

1198
01:30:57,460 --> 01:30:59,460
Stuff that you're doing where should they go?

1199
01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:03,540
You will perish in flames. That's what I have to say about that

1200
01:31:06,180 --> 01:31:12,180
There's a little man on the front. Who's the little man? Who's the guy who was he supposed to be made up guy made up guru

1201
01:31:12,820 --> 01:31:19,220
Right, but you will perish in flames is I stole it from the ghostbusters. I don't know if you remember the scene where

1202
01:31:21,460 --> 01:31:23,460
The the short guy maranus

1203
01:31:24,580 --> 01:31:30,020
Approaches the horse and buggy in central park and first goes up to the horse and says

1204
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:36,820
Are you the key master or something like that right to the horse and then runs off with his eyes blazing

1205
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:40,660
Screaming at the driver. You will perish in flames

1206
01:31:41,380 --> 01:31:45,620
So, uh, that's a little guy. How many people have got how many people have got donald trump

1207
01:31:46,740 --> 01:31:51,140
Quoted on the back of their book talking about no, no, no, he's not quoted. He's quoting me

1208
01:31:51,940 --> 01:31:58,180
Yeah, yeah, but it's he that's him on the back of your book talking about your work. There's not many people that must have had that

1209
01:31:59,860 --> 01:32:04,260
Uh, I was very pleased that he recognized that I was telling the truth

1210
01:32:05,860 --> 01:32:09,540
About carbon dioxide being the primary element for all life

1211
01:32:10,260 --> 01:32:15,780
Etc and that there was no climate emergency or crisis as it may have been called at that time pretty impressive

1212
01:32:16,260 --> 01:32:21,780
That was an appearance on tucker carlson. Uh, yeah, what have you got a website? Do you have a twitter or anything like that?

1213
01:32:22,420 --> 01:32:24,420
Yeah, I got a twitter. It's ecosense now

1214
01:32:25,300 --> 01:32:32,100
Uh, and it's it's I got nearly a hundred thousand followers. They dropped back about ten thousand when a lot of people quit twitter

1215
01:32:32,820 --> 01:32:39,460
Uh, and but I've stayed on and I just recently I said I'm quitting twitter finally because the taliban is on it

1216
01:32:39,540 --> 01:32:42,740
and they're kicking all these other people off who who aren't the taliban

1217
01:32:43,540 --> 01:32:49,540
and uh, people I had about a thousand people come back and say stay man stay so

1218
01:32:50,260 --> 01:32:57,220
Because we need you here. And so it's very difficult these days to know when you should like with the the uh,

1219
01:32:57,860 --> 01:32:59,300
vaccine

1220
01:32:59,300 --> 01:33:00,260
issue

1221
01:33:00,260 --> 01:33:03,780
Uh, I I know that in law and in medicine

1222
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:12,100
Informed consent has always been the rule that nobody is required to consent to any medical treatment surgery

1223
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:14,500
needles

1224
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:16,020
Uh pills

1225
01:33:16,020 --> 01:33:18,020
Right without their own consent

1226
01:33:18,580 --> 01:33:21,940
Everybody has a right as an individual to refuse treatment in other words

1227
01:33:22,580 --> 01:33:26,180
And they're trying to turn that on its head by threatening people with their livelihoods

1228
01:33:26,660 --> 01:33:32,180
And with their ability to be a normal person they might as well stamp a a brand on their forehead, right?

1229
01:33:32,900 --> 01:33:34,100
and

1230
01:33:34,100 --> 01:33:37,380
and make them second-class citizens is what they're doing and so

1231
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:41,460
People are saying to me. Well, why did you get vaccinated then and

1232
01:33:42,740 --> 01:33:44,980
It's a trip. Well, because I want to be

1233
01:33:45,940 --> 01:33:50,420
But I respect the right of other people not to want to be and actually on gutfeld

1234
01:33:51,140 --> 01:33:53,620
uh, he had trump on the last two nights

1235
01:33:55,220 --> 01:33:59,380
And trump made that same point because his wife doesn't want to be vaccinated

1236
01:34:00,340 --> 01:34:02,020
and uh

1237
01:34:02,020 --> 01:34:05,780
Gutfeld and trump came to the conclusion that that was perfectly her right

1238
01:34:06,580 --> 01:34:09,300
That is the truth if we don't if we allow

1239
01:34:10,180 --> 01:34:16,820
Society to force us into medical treatments. Maybe next they'll want our skin to make lampshades, you know

1240
01:34:17,460 --> 01:34:22,980
So you this is a fundamental principle in medicine is informed consent and in law

1241
01:34:23,860 --> 01:34:27,460
And they're trying to bust it down so that they can have control over everybody

1242
01:34:27,780 --> 01:34:30,420
To say what they should have to have injected into their bodies

1243
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:37,540
And personally, I believe the vaccines are efficacious. I also had covid was in the hospital for six days

1244
01:34:38,260 --> 01:34:39,620
Really sick

1245
01:34:39,620 --> 01:34:45,780
After I had my first vaccination it had not yet taken effect or I was one of those people who gets it anyways

1246
01:34:46,340 --> 01:34:47,460
but it's

1247
01:34:47,460 --> 01:34:48,580
normally

1248
01:34:48,580 --> 01:34:51,380
After two vaccinations at least you're 95 percent

1249
01:34:51,940 --> 01:34:53,780
Immune and now I'm

1250
01:34:53,780 --> 01:34:56,500
Must be close to 100 percent immune because I survived covid

1251
01:34:56,740 --> 01:35:01,460
But they don't take that into account. So the the fact that they're not taking covid survivors as

1252
01:35:02,020 --> 01:35:09,940
Equivalent to vaccinated people is also another travesty in this whole thing. So I it's like climate. It's like the climate issue in some ways

1253
01:35:10,660 --> 01:35:12,660
um, but it's even more

1254
01:35:13,060 --> 01:35:15,060
bizarre from a

1255
01:35:15,060 --> 01:35:21,380
Political control point of view because they're really pulling the levers here, you know and trying to make it so that

1256
01:35:21,780 --> 01:35:23,940
all all of their subjects are

1257
01:35:25,140 --> 01:35:27,380
Are subject to their whims

1258
01:35:28,180 --> 01:35:30,180
And we got to fight that

1259
01:35:30,260 --> 01:35:34,180
And so people are blaming me for not fighting it because I've got it vaccinated

1260
01:35:34,420 --> 01:35:39,060
So it's really complicated that way from an intellectual point of view as to I should should I join

1261
01:35:39,620 --> 01:35:45,620
Even though I've been vaccinated should I join the anti-vaxxers in a march? You know, no, I'm not anti-vaxxer

1262
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:47,620
right

1263
01:35:47,620 --> 01:35:49,620
And neither is trump. He's vaccinated

1264
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:53,140
Well, he brought us the product apparently

1265
01:35:54,020 --> 01:35:56,980
Maybe a conversation for another time patrick. Thanks so much for today

1266
01:35:57,700 --> 01:36:02,580
