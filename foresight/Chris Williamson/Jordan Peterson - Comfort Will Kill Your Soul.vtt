00:00.000 --> 00:04.960
Talking about the individual one of the things that I see holding people back is comfort

00:04.960 --> 00:09.240
So it's easy to get life to a stage where it's not that bad

00:09.680 --> 00:13.760
But it's not that good either at least when you have a full-on breakdown

00:13.760 --> 00:17.000
There's only one way to go right you're only going to go up from there

00:17.000 --> 00:21.560
But I think it's possible to wallow for years in a just about passable life

00:21.880 --> 00:26.600
Right sedated by comfort and I see this temptation in myself as well to give up the good for the great

00:26.920 --> 00:31.400
What would you say to people who are trying to escape this curse of mediocrity?

00:34.120 --> 00:37.320
Well, if you're satisfied with it in some fundamental sense

00:37.320 --> 00:39.520
I mean, there's there's something to be said

00:39.520 --> 00:44.360
I suppose for walling off of private space for yourself if you can maintain it and

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
Detaching yourself to some degree from the troubles of the world and

00:48.560 --> 00:54.600
Maintaining your own little private garden the problem with that is the snakes tend to seep in from the outside, right?

00:54.600 --> 00:59.040
It's it's pretty difficult to wall yourself off in any real sense from the concerns of the world

00:59.560 --> 01:02.640
So it isn't clear to me that that's a viable solution

01:02.840 --> 01:08.480
It also means that you might justify to yourself lack of civic engagement, you know, I shouldn't go to church

01:08.480 --> 01:15.380
I shouldn't take part in the political process because it's all so corrupt. I should hide myself from all the annoying

01:16.240 --> 01:21.680
Noise that's generated constantly on the media front and I have some sympathy for that viewpoint, but I

01:22.240 --> 01:26.160
Don't believe it's really possible because you can't have

01:27.000 --> 01:29.800
You can't have a walled garden independent of

01:30.560 --> 01:36.200
Independently of the health of the broader society. It's just not possible. Maybe you can have it for a very short period of time

01:36.200 --> 01:38.040
but so

01:38.040 --> 01:45.400
But if you're if you're comfortable with what you have and it's Jen it's genuine comfort and I think okay, but generally

01:45.400 --> 01:49.160
It's not I think for the most part. It's it's people that have become sedated, you know

01:49.160 --> 01:54.240
They've forgotten their dreams, but they've forgotten that they've forgotten them pink Floyd's comfortably numb is about this, right?

01:54.240 --> 01:59.800
They've become comfortably numb. I think most people said I have this friend and this this story really hit me

01:59.960 --> 02:01.960
So during the pandemic

02:02.560 --> 02:03.520
Running a podcast

02:03.520 --> 02:08.880
I was able to have the thing that I feel I'm good at my artistic

02:09.200 --> 02:14.240
Pursuit and outlet that was available for me to continue. It was actually increased because I didn't have other stuff to do

02:14.640 --> 02:16.640
now have a friend that's a barber and

02:16.800 --> 02:20.720
He got a job at a supermarket barbers shut down for a long period of time

02:20.720 --> 02:23.960
He got to job at a supermarket stacking shelves overnight and I asked him I was like man

02:23.960 --> 02:28.440
How are you? How are you finding the new job? This is a big a big change. He's like, do you know what it is?

02:28.440 --> 02:29.400
I

02:29.400 --> 02:32.600
Actually don't mind the work and mind the people that I work with mm-hmm

02:32.880 --> 02:40.000
But man, I miss being good at something right, right, right. Well, dude that hit me. Yeah, so hard, right

02:40.000 --> 02:46.520
I missed being good at something. Yeah. Yeah, well people need the opportunity to be good at something

02:46.760 --> 02:51.880
It so then you might ask yourself. Well, what's the best antidote to the discomfort of life?

02:51.880 --> 02:55.760
and you might say well, it's comfort and I

02:58.120 --> 03:01.960
Suppose that's what you act out when you swaddle a baby

03:03.000 --> 03:07.640
but a better antidote is something like adventure to excellence and

03:09.800 --> 03:14.560
That's far better antidote to suffering than the mere absence of suffering

03:15.360 --> 03:16.600
So

03:16.600 --> 03:21.720
Not to say that the mere absence of suffering. That's not nothing, you know, stepping out of that

03:22.440 --> 03:27.880
Sedation from comforts difficult that especially if you've become routine eyes to it. Yeah, well, that's the difficult

03:28.560 --> 03:34.480
Difficulty of maturity. You know the Freudians said very wisely that the good mother necessarily fails

03:35.120 --> 03:36.480
What's that mean?

03:36.480 --> 03:43.000
I mean, she stops providing the comfort that insulates people against the need for adventure. I heard you say recently that

03:43.960 --> 03:50.480
A mother's ability to let her child go out into the world knowing that they're still vulnerable and that it's now

03:50.640 --> 03:55.320
Down to them and the world still look after them. That's one of the bravest things that it's the female crucifixion

03:55.760 --> 03:59.360
So and that's exemplified best in well the best

04:00.760 --> 04:05.720
Portrayal of that I've seen is Michelangelo's pieta. You know, it's it's a statue of Mary

04:06.680 --> 04:15.440
And she has Christ's body on her as an adult on her lap and he's broken and destroyed and you know, she's displaying that

04:17.840 --> 04:19.240
That's

04:19.240 --> 04:26.320
That's the bravery of a mother to allow that to happen, but not only that to to facilitate it

04:27.360 --> 04:34.360
Facilitate it. So what about we go kid? Where you go? Where you go? Well, why it's dangerous out there. It's like, yeah, no kidding

04:36.600 --> 04:41.920
It's more dangerous here if you stay with me by a lot

04:43.520 --> 04:47.560
So you might lose your body out there in the world, but if you stay here you lose your soul

04:51.320 --> 04:55.520
How do you see that as an individual let's say that there isn't the mother there that's pushing you along

04:57.280 --> 05:00.640
Well, you know, one of the things young Carl Jung

05:00.880 --> 05:07.440
Was very interested in the edible complex and that's basically that overprotective maternal and

05:08.960 --> 05:10.960
he

05:10.960 --> 05:14.800
He criticized Freud or presuming that it was

05:15.480 --> 05:17.480
Really something the mother did

05:17.800 --> 05:24.280
He says it's more relational than that first of all it would be something the father would allow to happen assuming there was a father around

05:24.280 --> 05:28.640
So let's not forget about the paternal contribution to allowing that to occur

05:29.640 --> 05:32.640
Because in some sense, it's the father's role to

05:33.200 --> 05:36.640
Serve as the antithesis of that maternal over protection

05:36.640 --> 05:42.760
So a woman is extremely bonded with her infant say between zero and nine months and the infant is utterly helpless

05:42.760 --> 05:48.920
And so complete compassion and the provision of comfort is the only job that matters

05:48.920 --> 05:53.440
And that's really the case and then the woman has to switch gears to some degree

05:53.440 --> 05:57.040
The mother has to switch gears as the child starts to become more

05:57.520 --> 06:06.060
More mobile fundamentally and more independent. She has to let go of the infant, which is a real grieving process and

06:06.760 --> 06:10.800
She has to start to facilitate this movement towards independence

06:10.800 --> 06:18.240
But that's a hard shift and so partly the role of the father in that is to be an advocate for the child's independence and to

06:19.080 --> 06:24.600
Comfort the mother to let her know that that degree of security provision is no longer necessary, but also to

06:25.200 --> 06:28.120
Act as an advocate for the child's outgoing

06:30.120 --> 06:34.840
Outgoing desire and so so it's the edible situation is not only the mother

06:34.840 --> 06:40.760
It's also say the weak father, but then it's also the child so you can imagine because you don't

06:41.920 --> 06:43.920
believe that these

06:44.640 --> 06:46.640
negotiated agreements were

06:46.640 --> 06:49.960
We're relational so, you know, you're six

06:50.680 --> 06:52.680
You're in grade one

06:53.160 --> 06:55.160
Maybe you're feeling a little ill

06:55.400 --> 06:57.000
Maybe you're not

06:57.000 --> 07:04.280
Maybe you're playing with being a little ill and maybe you're playing with exaggerating how ill you are and your mom comes downstairs and says

07:05.000 --> 07:10.160
You know, you've got a test today at school. Maybe you haven't quite prepared for it. Maybe, you know, you should have and

07:10.760 --> 07:14.240
She says but you know, you you seem to have a tummy ache

07:15.080 --> 07:19.120
Maybe you're too sick to go to school and the kid thinks

07:20.360 --> 07:22.360
Maybe I could just stay home and

07:22.680 --> 07:28.760
You know, mom could tuck me in and I wouldn't have to take that test and I wouldn't have to confront the world and he says, yeah

07:29.560 --> 07:31.720
Yeah, mom my stomach really hurts and

07:32.320 --> 07:34.320
and away we go and

07:34.960 --> 07:40.480
The child has made a choice and you think well, that's and that's a catastrophic choice

07:40.480 --> 07:44.600
And you think well children shouldn't be held accountable for choices. They make at that age. It's like

07:47.160 --> 07:50.480
That child soon gonna be an adult that's going to make very similar decisions

07:50.760 --> 07:58.880
The the choice has consequences and to be held accountable for that is to recognize purely that the choice has consequences

07:58.880 --> 08:02.000
And that it is a choice now, you know, you could say well

08:03.040 --> 08:08.600
95% of the blame is to be put on the mother and maybe that's an overestimate. I think it probably is but

08:09.520 --> 08:14.240
the child could say mom you don't have to worry about me. I'm gonna get up and go do this and

08:16.720 --> 08:18.720
That's choice and

08:19.280 --> 08:21.280
That's the right choice

08:21.320 --> 08:24.760
so these are always chicken and egg problems obviously but

08:25.560 --> 08:32.880
That that fleshes out the complexity of the situation, you know, if you're if you're being enticed down a pathological road

08:33.800 --> 08:36.320
You can accept or reject the invitation now

08:36.320 --> 08:44.280
Some people are better at enticing and some people enforce it more harshly and you know, there's all sorts of individual variability in situations like this, but

08:45.280 --> 08:50.320
Just because you're offered debate doesn't necessarily mean that you have to take it

08:51.160 --> 08:56.000
So and I'm not a determinist. I do believe that people have free will whatever that means

08:57.200 --> 09:00.680
That's a murky subject and it gets complicated the more you look at it

09:00.680 --> 09:07.200
But whatever it's still a good shorthand way of describing the fact that we seem to be

09:07.960 --> 09:12.000
Cursed with responsibility for our own destiny at least to some degree

09:12.600 --> 09:16.760
