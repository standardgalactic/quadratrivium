0	5880	What's wrong with being a nice guy? What's wrong with being a nice guy? That's that's a good question
5880	8940	You know when I put out a book called no more. Mr. Nice guy
8940	10920	I'm sure a lot of people picked it up that wait a minute
10920	16040	There's already enough not nice guys out there why somebody write a book teaching men how to be not nice
16400	17320	but
17320	22480	The problem with being a nice guy just a quick elevator pitch is that a nice guy is a guy who?
22840	27960	Inaccurately internalized the belief system every young age. I'm not okay just as I am
28200	33440	So he's trying to do two things very unconsciously usually one has become what he thinks
33960	39080	Everybody else wants him to be so he'll be liked and loved and get his needs met and get laid hopefully
39480	44720	regularly and hide anything about himself that might get a negative reaction from people
45280	50840	Hiding his needs his wants and sexuality so while he's trying to get laid. He's hiding his sexuality
51520	55800	so a core problem with nice guy syndrome is nice guys tend to be un
56320	58320	Unauthentic
58560	64040	There there there's not a real them there. They're trying to become something hide something and
64640	68000	That tends to make them fairly dishonest untrustworthy
69280	71280	Frustrated resentful passive aggressive
72360	77840	A whole list of traits that can go along and and mainly it prevents and I'm a recovering nice guy
77840	80240	So I'm not speaking down to anybody, you know
80240	83560	It keeps us from just being ourselves living up for our full potential
84360	89560	Having what we want in life having a good time and so just a lot of baggage comes along with it
89880	97400	What are the component parts of being a nice guy? What are the traits that they embody or project?
98440	102840	Worry what you'll recognize most often and what listeners may recognize in themselves
103560	105560	Core tendencies often people pleasing
106160	112800	Seeking external validation and and for men usually that seeking validation from women even even gay guys
112800	117360	I find tend to do it even if they don't plan on having sex with the women they
118320	120320	We can talk more about this, but we're
120920	128080	We've learned from birth to please women. So there's that people pleasing that external validation
129080	130280	I'm
130280	136880	Failing to live up to one's full potential a basic court is honesty, you know thinking, you know, I'm a good guy
136880	142680	I'm pretty honest. I always laugh when men tell me they're pretty honest. I say that's actually a contradiction of terms
143560	145560	You're honest or you're not
146800	148800	And
149640	154760	And just you know for most nice guys, there's just a certain dull
155400	161120	Depression that they live with just thinking, you know, I should be happy. I should be getting what I want
161120	167240	I should be getting love. I should I should but I'm not and I don't know why not and
167840	175120	So there's there's a lot of characteristics, but the core piece you'll see the most often is that people pleasing seeking of external validation
176400	178400	Who is the
178920	183160	Prototypical nice guy avatar like just describe him for me
185200	187200	He's you know
187840	192480	He's just just that guy that's you know walking through life trying to make everybody happy
192600	197600	Try not to do anything wrong. Don't want to fuck anything up doesn't want to piss anybody off
198120	202320	Goes along to get along, you know, we've heard that, you know, happy wife happy life
202320	204320	If I just make everybody happy
204480	210360	Everything's good. I have a course that I've taught for a number of years called nice guys don't finish last
210360	212760	They rot in middle management. So he's good
214040	220680	But you know, he doesn't excel he doesn't stand out because standing out is actually really scary for nice guys
221120	223480	It's too much attention. It's too much expectation
225600	229560	So, you know, when I started working with nice guys 30 years ago
230720	235600	Most of the men I worked with, you know, probably were around my age. I was in my early 30s at that time and
236320	238320	So there's a lot of baby
238320	245600	Baby boom generation guys, you know, they they were trying to be different than their fathers the World War two, you know, man
246240	253080	They were in that protest generation against Vietnam growing their hair out getting in touch with their feminine side
253080	257000	And so a lot of the men I worked with, you know, kind of grew up in that era
257160	261600	But I've been doing this for a while. And so, you know, my son's 38 for example
261600	267120	So, you know, I worked with Millennials Millennials men younger than that and what's funny is
267640	270480	Whereas my generation a lot of the men
271400	276880	Kind of attribute part of their nice guy stuff to well, my dad wasn't there or you know, my parents divorced
276880	279920	Oh, you know, he worked all the time or he's an alcoholic
280760	287240	Nowadays I hear a lot of men say, oh, my dad was a nice guy and and about all he taught me about life was don't piss off your mother
287240	291480	And and because he was walking around eggshells trying not to piss off my mother
291760	297440	So, you know, I've seen that whole range all the way from the guys that were reacting to, you know, the
298760	300760	asshole
302280	308960	Patriarchal father to now the guys that were raised by nice guys and they don't know any other way of being
309400	315120	It's like one generation had the tyrant and the other generation had the compliant
315640	319480	That's a good way to put it. That's nice. Yeah, the tyrant the compliant
319480	322560	Yeah, it was but here's the interesting thing, right?
322560	326360	And it's so fascinating that you had one generation that was
327040	329040	Rebelling in their niceness
329040	332320	Even if that niceness isn't that nice. Yeah, and then another generation
332960	337120	That was following in their niceness. So there seems to be a particular
338160	340160	stickiness to niceness if
341480	347680	Tyrants that are emotionally unavailable and not nice are able to create nice guys and
348480	350320	nice
350320	352320	Fathers are also big trouble
353800	361680	What's why is it so prevalent? What is what is this pull? Are we as men are we inculcating or absorbing something from the world?
361680	364560	Is this the way that we were raised by mom and dad is the
365520	369000	What's the gen what's the origin? What's the genesis the seed of this?
370200	375040	That's a good question, of course and this course what every nice guy wants. Well, how do I get to be this way?
375040	377280	You know who cursed me with this. Yeah
377680	384480	I I quickly learned when I started working with nice guys again 30 years ago that there is no one
384800	391080	You know one size fit all how you how you got to be a nice guy. I thought there was it first. I thought they're all like me, you know
392280	398440	Disconnected from their father in some significant way, you know significantly raised by their mother trying to please their mom and
399640	402960	And I thought well that that explains it all but it didn't and
403840	409560	There's so many pieces that go into a lot of men I work with that identifies being nice guys
409560	414600	I think part of it's their temperament part of it's just they're easy going, you know
414600	423080	My my mother would often say in adulthood to women. I was dating. Oh Bobby never did like conflict and I'm thinking
423320	426560	Thanks mom, you know what are you telling these women be nice to my son?
426560	431000	Don't be mean to him, but I'm also thinking who does like conflict, you know
431000	435640	I do tend to marry women who like to fight but I for me
435640	441200	It's kind of like, you know, I can't can't can't you know instead of us you doing something that starts a fight
441200	446360	I say to them can't I just yell at you a little bit you cry and then I hold you in that really what you know
446360	451240	This is all about anyway, and my wife always say no, it doesn't countless. You're really mad at me
452360	456440	So I don't like conflict in particular. So that's my temperament
457440	462240	Disposition that many of the nice guys will have the raw materials of someone that's a little bit
463240	464520	Yeah, part of my nature
464520	469800	But but that's just kind of one category of nice guy the other one that that I bumped into I call often those
469800	474200	I'm so good nice guy. He's the guy that just always did everything right no matter what, you know
474440	479240	But the other side I talk about you know one mr. Nice guy is what I called. I'm so bad nice guy
479480	482880	This is the one that you know, maybe start rebelling at an early age
483120	487440	Maybe at 80 HD undiagnosed, you know, he's always impulsive getting in trouble
487840	493200	You know not following through getting yelled at getting punished starts doing drugs and alcohol at 14
493360	498000	You know drops out of school and then maybe at some point as a come to jesus moment
498320	501200	Religion military gets married as a kid
501840	507520	Death in the family. He goes I got I got to quit, you know self-destructing. I got a I got to be nicer
508000	512240	So there's that kind of nice guy as well. So it's a different temperament than the than the other
513600	518880	One of the pieces, you know, there's so many pieces that go into this but to answer your question, how do we
519440	521440	What's the stickiness part?
523120	529920	Again, I think a real core piece that I see with so many nice guys is this attempt to please women and
531200	535920	I I was talking to somebody the other day it makes perfect sense because if you think about it
536320	542560	We're all born to a woman our earliest caregiver. It is not mom. It's probably some other woman
542960	548160	So from the time we're born our very survival our sustenance our okayness
548720	554400	Depends on a woman and probably us getting along with that woman. That's probably a good thing, right?
555040	561920	And so that's really normal that the our first experiences are how to how to negotiate a relationship with a woman to make that
562240	565200	Big powerful holds our our life in her hands
565840	567840	Person how to make sure that's okay
568560	574400	And I don't know about in the uk but when I was growing up in Seattle. I had one male teacher
575120	583200	Before I got to junior high there's four times more female fighter pilots in the us air force by percentage
583520	585520	Then there are male kindergarten teachers
586320	590240	There you go. You've done your research so so I had one teacher
590240	595760	So that means just to learn how to get from second to third grade not only had to learn my reading writing and arithmetic
596080	600640	How to please a woman. Okay, all of that's fine. There's there's nothing inherently wrong with that
600640	603520	I think that's actually probably the way it's always been
604160	607600	But historically I mean if we go back even two or three generations
607600	609600	But if you go through most of human history
610000	612000	Out of about age 12
612160	614960	The men came into the boys life took him
615360	621280	You know from the women took him out had a masculine initiation taught him how to get comfortable being uncomfortable
621360	624800	How to face his fear how to live in the scary world of the masculine
625280	630880	And therefore and spent most of his time from them on out with men in the masculine
631520	636240	And and so he got he moved through that what do I have to do to please a woman?
636720	640400	So I think that's a really normal thing that to try to please women
641360	643360	The survival for for every young boy
643840	647760	But what was missing is there's no initiation to teach them
648000	654240	How to how to go face their fears in the scary world with the masculine and quit seeking the approval and validation of women
654560	661040	Because there's this really interesting paradox that I took me years to find out and you know a lot of men I work with takes
661200	663200	You know, it's a big surprise
663600	665600	is all
665600	670720	Pursuing women and trying to please them doesn't make them interested in you. It doesn't make them like you
670720	673680	It doesn't make them want to have sex with you. No, it actually doesn't
674400	680240	Actually not trying to please women tends to make a guy more interesting to women in general
680240	683920	That's a big paradox for a lot of the men I work with and it was for me
684080	685280	You mean I mean all this
685680	691600	Me listening and talk about their problems me trying to be different than the jerks they complain about me repressing my sexuality
691680	694000	So it's not like I just want that one thing from them
694320	698640	Oh, you know all that doesn't make them interested in me. No, it doesn't actually
699200	703440	But they do seem to be drawn and attracted to the guy who's comfortable in his own skin
704320	707600	Living a life, you know on his terms connected with men
708480	711840	Putting a big dent in the universe that is really attractive
712160	716160	But there's no note. How do I get this woman's approval involved in that whole mix?
717200	720560	What are the covert contracts? Oh, I'm glad yes that
721280	724800	That's um, that's my favorite part. I'm no more mr. Nice guy and I know
725600	728480	Many men read it say robert. That is the biggest takeaway
729360	735680	The covert contracts are unspoken often unconscious agreements that the nice guy has
736480	741360	With everything that's not him with the world with god with women, you know, which is how things work
742240	743280	and
743280	749920	In the book I I I'm a little bit general, but I've broken it down to three specific covert contracts that nice guys have
750240	756880	They're all if then uh, if I do this then this will happen. They they all are basically manipulative
757040	762720	They all have strings attached and often the nice guy isn't aware of them and nobody else is either
763040	765040	So covert contract number one
765040	769280	If I'm a good guy, I will be liked and loved and get my and and
769920	773680	Going back to and the women I'm trying to impress will want to be with me and have sex with me
773760	775760	So if I'm good, I'll be liked and loved
776480	781120	Number two if I meet everybody else's needs without them having to ask
781680	785120	Then they will meet my needs without me having to ask
785680	786800	now
786880	789200	Unfortunately, nobody else knows this contract exists
789200	794080	So they don't know they're supposed to be reading our minds and figure out what we want like we're trying to do for them
794800	801520	Another core problem with this is that nice guys are actually really terrible receivers. We're not good at letting people do force
801520	806560	We're not good at giving to ourselves. So that's covert contract number two covert contract number three
807120	812160	Is if I do everything right, then I will have a smooth problem free world
812640	817840	So it's kind of a peter panish kind of thing, you know, I I do everything right? I'm a good guy
818160	819920	but unfortunately
819920	825440	We're the player the referee the scorekeeper and we got the big scoreboard. I've done everything right
825440	828560	How come this stuff still isn't going the way it's supposed to go in my life
829200	833760	So nice guys are walking around these covert contracts and you ask, you know, what are
835040	837520	What what what's the core characteristic of a nice guy?
837760	840560	One of them is is that they're often really resentful
841120	844080	You know, they might say well, I'm kind of bugger. I'm kind of frustrating
844080	850720	But the really resentful not an arrangement because I've been doing this. I've been doing it right. I've been following the rules
850800	855520	I've been, you know, being the good guy. I've been meeting your needs. I've been, you know, following all the rules
855920	857920	You know, how come I'm wins at my turn
857920	862640	How come I'm not getting all the all the stuff that I thought I would and that leads to a lot of resentments
862640	866080	And that's one way I can tell I tell nice guys
866480	870240	They well, how do I know if I'm if I'm using covert contracts and I'll go
870560	876240	You'll know because you're walking around resentful and pissed off either because you didn't get back
876640	880880	In turn or you didn't get appreciated for for all that that you did
881360	887760	I heard somebody share a quote the other day that I really liked to me is another really nice way of putting covert contracts
887760	890720	And this I guess was from Neil Strauss and he says
891120	901760	Un unspoken expectations expectations are premeditated resentment. Isn't that that that is what happens with covert contracts phenomenal by him? Yeah
902960	904960	that
906880	909360	So the frustration and the resentfulness
910800	912480	that's coming from
912480	914960	offering to the world something that you think should be
915920	919600	Universally liked you have that there is there's no way that anybody could be
920320	927280	Offended by what I'm doing. I'm following the rules. I'm offering the world lots whilst asking for nothing in return
928000	928800	and
928800	933040	The fact that not asking for something in return results and you getting nothing in return
933680	935680	Finding how that works. I don't know
936640	941920	But it's I suppose this as well plays into the dishonesty bit and it's so I understand
941920	944960	I would say that I'm I'm very much in nice guy category
946560	948560	Very much a people pleaser
949280	953040	My temperament is to be averse to conflict as well
954080	958160	I've made a dent in many ways, but it's been done
959280	962800	It's been done by weaving my way through avoiding
963440	965440	much of the the conflict
966160	968160	That that I would maybe need to
968240	971600	So I suppose I can be at least in some regards a
972880	979760	A paragon or like a a a role model for the successful nice guy in in many ways and me too
979920	984400	You know, again, I don't like conflict, but you know, I you know, I'm doing okay
984960	991280	There's something I always felt I always felt the fact that I wasn't like my go-to isn't typically
992720	995600	Aggression that's not what I lean into
996160	997200	Um
997200	1002080	Despite the fact I've got a background of fighting and and doing other things and physical training and stuff like that
1002320	1004320	I always felt like it emasculated me
1004640	1006960	The fact that there was something more heroic
1007520	1013520	About being someone that was quick to anger, you know, there was something kind of typically masculine about that and I think I was
1015760	1021760	Not strong enough to say ashamed, but it felt it it didn't feel as
1023200	1024400	grand
1024400	1026400	to be someone who
1026560	1031920	Would be I know that there's an ability in you know being under control having your emotions under control
1032400	1034560	um, but there's also a degree of
1035280	1039040	Fragility, I think that you can sometimes feel with that also
1039600	1044400	Well, let me give a one way to maybe look at the model and see if it fits what you're saying
1045280	1048000	Is that when I was writing no more mr. Nice guy
1048000	1053600	I really focused a lot on shame being a core foundation of a nice guy syndrome that internalized belief
1053760	1055360	I'm not okay and
1055360	1061440	Inaccurately internalized belief from our earliest life experience a few weeks old few few months old
1062480	1065200	by the time I finished writing the book and it was you know
1066000	1070880	Getting ready to be published. I by that time. I'd really come to also see that anxiety plays
1071360	1078160	Maybe an equally significant role in nice guy syndrome. So where everything that nice guys are doing is trying to manage that sense of shame
1078160	1083120	I'm not okay. I'm unlovable. I'm defective and their anxiety states, you know, I might piss somebody off
1083120	1086720	I might get rejected. I might get hurt. I might lose. I might look foolish
1087120	1093040	so, you know, both of those states really play into it and one of the things I've come to see is is that
1094240	1096640	Whether we've got just just kind of break it down
1096640	1100640	whether we got kind of the asshole jerk over here that fighter that quick to fight guy
1101120	1107040	Or the wussy doormat, you know, the nice guy over here. That's the avoidant and kind of doesn't like the conflict
1108000	1111040	I think they're they're both on the the same continuum
1111120	1116880	I think they are both in a fight flight freeze mode of managing their interstates of anxiety
1117120	1121920	The nice guy is in the flight freeze bond sometimes added to that list
1122480	1125440	And what we call the jerk is in the fight mode now
1125520	1127520	They're both still just trying to manipulate
1128160	1135120	People and situations outside of them because they're anxious the nice guy does it by being nice and avoidant and not upsetting anybody
1135200	1138800	And you know waiting for it to blow over you all that kind of whereas, you know
1138800	1146400	The guy the other end of the spectrum is it's just he just quick to react with aggression to manage the people and situations around him
1146640	1149040	So so he doesn't feel afraid and anxious
1149760	1154000	And so men will often, you know, they'll read my book or you know, they'll hear some of my information
1154000	1157680	They'll say robert I get that being a nice guy isn't working and I don't want to be that
1158000	1162240	But I don't want to be the asshole either and you know, where where's that middle ground and I go
1162480	1165280	I actually don't know where the tipping point is between two
1166160	1168160	Dysfunctional extremes. It doesn't exist, right?
1168480	1172000	What what we're actually talking about is is going to a different plane a different level
1172320	1174080	Where we actually learn to soothe ourselves
1174080	1176880	We're actually learned to be assertive where we actually learn to have boundaries
1177120	1179600	Or we actually learn to be differentiated and ask ourselves
1179600	1185200	What do I want and follow through on it where there's you know, there's a whole different plane of behavior versus just
1185600	1187680	What do I do to not feel anxious here?
1187760	1194720	But again, the nice guy and the jerk probably neither one is aware that they're trying to manage their anxiety states
1195120	1197120	And and it isn't until you actually
1197680	1200480	Get told that maybe that's what you're doing you go. Oh, wow
1200720	1204800	I never thought about that before and then then you actually can feel your anxiety
1205120	1208000	Rather than trying to just manage it to where it doesn't, you know
1208640	1213520	Make you feel so anxious. Is it a desire to feel safe then to feel reassured?
1214320	1215920	Yeah, I think, you know
1215920	1217920	safety's at the core because
1217920	1221120	Well, I took child development 101 back in grad school
1221200	1224800	I think the very first thing they told us one of the few things maybe I remembered
1225200	1228640	Was that for every child abandonment equals death?
1229360	1232480	So children come into the world inherently vulnerable
1232880	1234480	All right, there's no one to take care of us
1234560	1240800	It takes humans longer to mature into self-sufficiency than any other animal on the planet
1241120	1244960	You know our grandfathers, maybe that was about 12 or 14, you know
1245600	1251040	My age was more, you know, considered 18 21 22 that was like 35 for a young man to you know
1251200	1255680	Mature to be able to take care of himself. That's a joke. Um, but but it's true
1256320	1262480	So we're dependent completely dependent and if somebody doesn't take care of us we die
1262720	1265840	So if we get abandoned neglected, uh, we die
1266240	1269840	So I know for me like when my wife, you know, I'm
1270560	1272960	My wife Lupita and I've been married for seven years now
1273520	1278800	Mexican woman I met here in Mexico and um, she gets a look on her face and like
1279680	1284480	I'll go into, you know, this motive. I gotta I gotta fix it. She's upset. She's angry. I gotta make it better
1284800	1286800	And you know, I've been working on this stuff for 30 years
1286800	1288080	So you know
1288080	1289600	Not like I don't know
1289600	1293360	You know what's happening and I'll just watch myself have this anxiety state
1293760	1297840	That I gotta I gotta talk her down through over get her back to good, you know, make her happy again
1298320	1303280	And I'm thinking why am I worried about with this short little Mexican woman? Why what look she has on her face?
1303360	1304720	I love her of course
1304720	1310560	But why why is that triggering such depth of anxiety and really is a you really sat with and worked with it
1311040	1315760	It triggers a really old emotional state that does feel like I'm gonna die
1316160	1318160	If this doesn't get better right now
1318640	1322000	I'm gonna die and I don't actually have that thought in my head
1322400	1325840	But my reaction to it feels that intense. That's the embodied
1326400	1331920	Sensation if you ask the embodied the nervous system my emotional operating system. Yeah, yeah
1333520	1334720	I wonder
1334720	1336880	Stepping outside of relationships for a second
1337680	1339680	Relationships with anybody including friendships
1340960	1342960	One of the patterns that I've noticed
1343200	1346640	Especially amongst some of my friends that are nice guys or recovering nice guys
1347680	1349280	Is a desire to
1349280	1350640	Do things right?
1350640	1354480	Oh, of course to like a task in and of itself
1355200	1357840	Uh, I would guess that nice guys are probably more orderly
1358480	1362240	than the normal person sources will be stacked in the in the right way
1362800	1364800	You know, mustn't have a very room
1365680	1369280	Because again, you'd think that you'd think that okay. I got to do it right
1369360	1374160	I got to do orderly, but you know, I've got my camera angled or you can't see what's over on the sides
1374240	1378480	All right, it's it's it's a mess. It is it's not terrible, but
1379360	1383680	It it is messier on the sides than it is behind me. Okay. And so
1384560	1386880	Again, a lot of the nice guys I work with
1388240	1391680	They may have perfectionistic expectations of themselves
1392320	1398080	Um, and some worked really hard to to to meet them and then they're they're in a state of anxiety all the time
1398560	1403440	But others I know they go, you know, I haven't made my bed in years. You know, I don't pick up after myself
1403440	1406480	I can't remember the last time I I checked my bank account balance
1406960	1410480	So you'd think there would be that but but ironically
1411280	1414400	Um, there's not and here's a piece that
1415600	1418560	That it may sound an odd on on the surface of it
1418720	1422000	But when I talk with nice guys about their fears and their anxieties
1422480	1427440	I think one of the biggest anxiety or fear state that the typical nice guy might have
1427840	1433760	Isn't so much a fear of failure fear of foolishness fear of looking foolish fear of loss fear of making a mistake
1434160	1436000	Is fear of success?
1436000	1443520	Because what happens if I do get it right? What happens if I rise up to a level of success and then, you know
1444560	1448560	There's things that can happen all of a sudden the bar gets raised the expectations are higher
1448560	1452240	I'm in a brighter spotlight. I might get attacked. I'm more visible
1452640	1453760	um
1453760	1457360	There's so many I'll lose control over my time all of these
1457920	1460880	Built in anxieties of what happens if I'm too successful
1461280	1463680	So again, a lot of times the nice guys will
1464480	1465280	unconsciously
1465280	1467280	I don't really like the word self sabotage
1467440	1471120	But they'll get in their own way of living up to to their full potential
1471520	1477360	And keeping things messy around you is actually a pretty good way to you know, you know, not live up your full potential
1477600	1481120	Not checking your bank account every now and then, you know, I'll bite you on the ass sooner or later
1481680	1483760	isn't it isn't interesting that the
1485680	1487680	almost universality of
1488400	1489920	high ability
1489920	1490800	of
1490800	1491840	this honest
1491840	1494000	Do you want to uh, do you need to sort the dog?
1497360	1499360	This is a regular occurrence I can see
1500320	1505440	She's usually in the room with me and and she's a deer. I this is my bringing her in she can chill
1505920	1510320	Yeah, the problem is she's upset because somebody's out front and I'm the only one home
1510560	1512560	And I don't want to go deal with whoever might be up
1513600	1518960	Okay, it could just be my wife getting home with my daughter from school. Okay. Okay. So um
1520240	1525680	Yeah, she's just being a good girl. Let me know exactly. Yeah, poppy. There's somebody out there. There's somebody out there
1525680	1531280	Let's go. Let's go and it may have been she just saw a cat. So, you know, I I don't know so be it um
1531680	1533680	She walked away. So
1534160	1540560	She's bored of you now. Yeah, it's interesting that there is uh, there's almost universality of
1541280	1547200	Uh, not having healthy boundaries. Yeah of being dishonest of being manipulative although you don't think that you are you're
1548000	1553360	Overly pliable in a way that means that you change yourself to get the outcome that you want from people
1553760	1559680	But it seems at least based on what you've said here that there there appears to be a boundary at least typically
1560160	1562400	among the nice guys where this doesn't
1563440	1565760	outside of relationships friendships
1566400	1567680	family
1567680	1571040	Dating etc. This doesn't spread out into a
1571760	1573360	Uh
1573360	1580480	Overbearing desire for for orderliness and and sort of perfectionism in all areas of life
1580960	1584640	You know with regards to an obsession about getting it right about being
1585440	1589920	It can't I just what I'm trying to say is it's not universal
1591200	1595920	Whereas the other stuff is yeah, but it's what it shows or at least what it says to me is that there's something
1596800	1600080	It it's obvious that ground zero for this stuff is relationships
1601520	1608240	You know that that would have been my first thought as well because it is for me and it is for many nice guys
1608560	1612960	But you know what I've I've seen guys who are total nice guys
1613520	1617520	In relationship and they get on the job and they kick ass
1618000	1622960	You know that they're highly successful at work. I've known other people that it showed up
1623200	1629840	You know at work where they're a told nice guy and going along to getting along and never really stepping up or never launching
1629920	1635360	You know that that business and but at home, you know, their their wife would say he's not a nice guy
1635360	1637520	He's nice to everybody else, but he's not nice to me
1637920	1643280	So it can be interesting and and that would again when I started working with nice guys
1643440	1646160	I just assume there's a one piece fits all
1646720	1650160	And and there's really not now there are those certain commonalities
1650880	1653760	But I think partly because we're also dealing with temperament
1654240	1658400	That for example, maybe you and I had very different life experiences
1658640	1663360	Maybe we have some similarities of temperament some differences different life experiences
1664080	1670320	We're not going to turn out just the same. We may still have those tendencies of you know seeking approval avoiding conflict
1670720	1676720	You know kind of a uh, oh, you know, I'm so good. Why doesn't everybody like me and everybody try to be just like me?
1677200	1678160	um
1678160	1680080	There might be some similarities
1680080	1684640	But we might be very different and still relate to this. Yes. I'm a nice guy
1685040	1689200	Understood. What about hidden behavior? They keep things hidden from themselves. They keep
1690640	1692320	Why is that so common?
1692320	1697120	Why is it common because you know those two things when you know when we first started you asked me, you know
1697200	1702960	What what is the nice guy and basically and and I said he's the guy trying to get everybody's approval and validation
1703120	1705840	You know holding your finger ups. It's which way is a wind blowing
1706320	1713680	But the other piece is that hiding things about ourselves, you know hiding anything for example that might get that look on my wife's face
1713840	1717920	You know, oh, she got that look. I must have done something. I better not do that again
1718240	1723600	You know again that began at a very very early age when getting that look from somebody important to us
1724000	1729920	might result in getting slapped getting smacked getting neglected getting yelled at getting shaken whatever
1730640	1732160	so
1732160	1738720	Nice guys. This is part of that. I got to hide whatever there is about me that tends to create these negative reactions around me
1739520	1745600	But often there's another piece not again not universal but often for nice guys in their family system
1746320	1750640	Somebody has been defined as the needy person the most important person
1750960	1755920	Could be dad could be mom could be a sibling and their needs were more important
1756320	1762240	All the attention and focus went on, you know making sure dad never got pissed off making sure mom didn't go on a tirade
1762320	1767920	Making sure, you know, brother doesn't you know, whatever, you know, he's sick or he's he's out of control
1768640	1772080	So often for nice guys, we try to become this needless
1772640	1776800	Wantless never rock the boat never be a moment's problem kind of person
1777280	1778400	so
1778400	1781120	What we interpret is us having needs
1781680	1786960	Draws too much attention and and you know my their needs are more important than mine and so
1788720	1790720	Nice guys, we're
1790800	1794000	Again trying to avoid that negative reaction the two things we often most hide
1794320	1799680	Are our needs and wants and our sexuality the sexuality that's kind of easy to put a finger on
1799680	1804320	You know, we live in a culture that we're bombarded with sexual stimuli everywhere you go
1804720	1811360	But still there's still that you know that religious message that sex is bad evil save it for the one you love shame
1811840	1816400	Yeah, just a whole shame wrapped around sexuality you'd think that would have gone away by now
1816640	1822240	But but it's not it's as strong as ever. So for the the the the very young nice guy
1823200	1827920	When kind of kind of back up a little bit back to the to the child development 101 stuff again
1829360	1834560	Every child when they experience discomfort of any kind, you know, the hungry and they don't get fed
1834640	1839040	They're they're they wet their diaper. They mess in their diaper. They don't get changed or cold. They don't get help
1839360	1842000	Then you know, they have stomach ache. They don't get burped whatever
1842640	1847760	Whenever a child experiences discomfort their children are narcissistic by nature
1848640	1851840	Emotionally, they assume this is me. I I'm the cause of this
1851920	1853440	I did something wrong. I'm bad
1853440	1860560	They don't think it because the thinking brain isn't online at this early age the emotional brain fight flight free survival brain is
1861440	1868320	And so a child will try to do two things in a very primitive way a non-thinking non-rational purely emotional way
1868720	1871440	They will try to medicate the feeling states they're having
1872000	1874880	Suck their thumb eat cry sleep
1875760	1878880	Whatever to try to not feel bad right now
1879600	1883120	And again in a very pre very primitive pre verbal
1883680	1885040	kind of way
1885040	1890880	Try to do try to not do whatever that was it caused the uncomfortable states or do something different
1891440	1895760	And so that begins at a really early age and so the child is
1896320	1902880	These these the shame is is inaccurately internalized at an emotional level. I must have done something wrong
1903120	1905120	That's why this is happening. So
1905760	1908400	I got to figure you how to do that different or not do that hide
1909040	1911040	And so all of this comes
1911200	1917920	So early as part of an emotional language an emotional operating system. It's not in words. It's not in picture memory
1918720	1920720	And it's it's primitive
1920720	1926880	So here we are trying to figure out how not to have these uncomfortable experiences and prevent them from happening again
1927360	1931280	And one of the best things our primitive brain came up with is hide
1932000	1935200	Hide, you know, whatever that I have needs all I have needs
1935520	1940480	I I get I'm I'm hungry when I have needs I get slapped. Oh, their needs are more important than mine
1940960	1942000	so
1942000	1945680	Just hiding is part of that because we think it must be about me
1946080	1950080	That's causing these painful negative experiences to be happening to us
1950800	1955200	Does this mean the nice guys often have coping strategies? Maybe they'll overeat
1955760	1960720	maybe they'll be compulsive with social media use or porn or video games or
1962240	1964240	Substances or whatever
1964720	1968000	The thing about that model. I just gave you that child development model
1968720	1970720	Every human does that every human
1971680	1977840	We all just pick usually again based on temperament and maybe just life experiences and birth order
1978400	1982480	We all pick what are we going to do? How are we going to try to manage this?
1982800	1986240	And I sucked my thumb times in kindergarten. I think maybe I was trying to
1986960	1991680	Deal with some uncomfortable self-soothing self-soothing exactly trying to manage some anxiety there
1992560	1994720	So that's what I did now
1995280	2001280	We we go through childhood then we hit adolescence and now we really want people's approval and want to fit in and be noticed
2001360	2002880	and have attention
2002880	2004880	All of this really, you know, it gets
2005760	2009520	Fueled with with with our hormones and need for attention
2010000	2015040	Where you know, they really get solidified and we pretty much carry these routines into adulthood
2015360	2017760	So yeah, trying to be perfect might be one
2018400	2023600	You know trying not to be perfect because my brother was perfect and I couldn't you know compete with him
2023840	2026320	So I'll be the opposite. I'll I'll make the mess
2027360	2032400	Yeah, when I eat I sure do feel better when I spend all my day and night playing video games
2032480	2039360	I I don't feel stressed when I'm oh, isn't porn amazing. I didn't know that this existed. Look how I feel
2040000	2045280	Um, oh, you know, if I get straight A's look, I I finally get some validation
2045280	2049680	But I don't know if it's ever enough. I better keep, you know succeeding performing
2050000	2053520	You know, I better get into great amazing shapes so I can be valuable
2053760	2059760	Oh, I'll never get in good shape. So who cares? I'll just keep eating it can take so many different forms
2060320	2065040	And the only real logic to it is the the infant logic
2065760	2069920	That you and I and everybody else had at a few weeks and a few months old
2071120	2074080	Why uh nice guys bad receivers
2077200	2082080	Because we think it makes us bad, you know, the the thing is is that
2082960	2089680	As I said, most of us is is most nice guys internalize this belief. Well, I because I have needs
2089760	2092880	That's why I I have these bad things that happen to me
2093040	2098880	If I don't have needs bad things won't happen and often again, they I could I could look around in my family
2099200	2105760	Oh, dad's needs are more important. Well, let's all make sure dad's okay. Oh now mom's unhappy. Let's all make sure mom's okay
2106240	2110880	My little brother was a general fuck up at pretty much everything. Oh, okay
2111200	2115440	You know, we got to make sure little brother's okay because he's gonna fuck up and I kind of like oh
2116000	2120400	If I don't have needs if I just kind of do everything right, I'll be the golden child
2120400	2126640	I'll get some validation. You know, I I won't get noticed too much and getting trouble and and so again
2126640	2128640	That was my story. It's not every nice guy story
2129680	2130640	but
2130640	2137520	There's some fundamental piece in there that if if is visible if people know I have needs like that makes me vulnerable
2137680	2142240	It puts me at risk. It gets people control over me. I'll owe people something
2142720	2150000	So in my own personal work, one of the earliest things I had to start doing was was making me a priority where I
2150400	2153760	Put where I did for me. I I'd do for everybody else
2154000	2159920	But I wouldn't make me a priority and you know, I'd make sure you know, my wife and kids they all went to the dentist
2160080	2163920	I wouldn't go to the dentist. Oh, they you know, if I saw something on sale, I'd buy it for them
2164000	2166960	I wouldn't buy it for me. So I had to start taking good care of me
2167600	2171600	The next step that that kind of came with that but came a little bit later for me
2171920	2179200	Was actually beginning to surround myself with people who wanted to help me meet my needs and then actually letting them
2179680	2186480	That was really anxiety producing to let people do things for me and I had to consciously just go
2187360	2191440	Okay, I'm it's as simple as like I'll take the garbage out
2191920	2194480	And you know, we got to take the garbage from the kitchen to the front gate
2194560	2197440	It's 20 feet got to unlock the gate put it out on the street
2197680	2200720	My if I'm taking the garbage at my wife will go you need help
2201440	2206160	Well, no, I don't I don't need any help to take a bag of garbage from the kitchen to the front
2206320	2210800	And and so I my gut response always say no, but then I realize well
2211440	2215280	I don't need any help, but she wants to be with me. She wants to accompany me
2215600	2219440	She doesn't want to think I'm doing all the work. Well, she's not she's very hard worker
2219920	2223760	I go. Yeah. Yeah, come help me. Do I really need the help? No
2224560	2228480	But it was actually it took me a while. I'm still learning that way
2228720	2231760	You know, she's not really thinking I need help taking the garbage out
2231920	2235760	She just wants to come take the garbage out with me just to walk to the street with me and back
2236160	2241120	You know, that's that's okay. Well, who might have say no to that? That's the thing about being a bad receiver
2241680	2243680	It robs people of the
2243920	2245360	enjoyment
2245360	2248720	Of helping you you've you've stole my words when I'm
2249520	2254720	When I got I got divorced in my late 40s after 25 years of marriage to two different women
2255440	2258640	And again when I started dating and started meeting nice girls, you know
2258640	2262000	Who wanted to do anything for me wouldn't ever say what they wanted wouldn't make it to say
2262160	2267360	I thought oh, I'd I'd empathy for my two ex-wives what I put them through with being an ice guy
2267360	2271920	But I remember I was dating one woman and I met her because she sold me shoes at Nordstrom
2272240	2276800	And she so she worked in retail fashion sales and her one time she came over to my apartment
2276880	2278880	And I'd done some laundry left it on my couch
2278960	2282480	She started folding my laundry and I said you you don't have to do that
2282640	2286160	She goes no, I like doing it and and she goes and I'm good at it
2286480	2289360	And you know, so she folds on my laundry puts a little stack on the end of my bed
2289360	2292800	And she goes but I won't put it away for you. I said I'm not putting it away either
2292880	2298320	I'm leaving it out there to remind me somebody loves me, you know that that somebody wanted to do something nice for me
2299040	2302880	After that I started leaving my clean laundry on the couch
2303600	2305600	So she could have the joy
2306160	2308480	Of coming over and because it gave her pleasure
2308640	2310880	Now who am I to rob her of that pleasure?
2311200	2316720	And I need to work on it because how am I going to receive great things in this world?
2317200	2321040	If I'm not good at receiving if I can't if I can't let somebody fold my laundry
2321520	2326080	How am I going to receive the blessings of wealth of fame opportunity of adventure?
2326480	2332560	So it's it's a very conscious practice. It was for me. So how do I let people give and let them have the pleasure of doing it?
2333920	2340240	So the solution is not being a bad guy because a lot of people and you could try
2341600	2343600	so, you know
2343840	2348960	Nice guys finish last the bad guy gets the girl, you know, women will
2350400	2355360	Sleep with the alpha but marry the beta, you know, pick your meme or cliche of choice
2355600	2358320	But they're all out there sure to come up with
2359360	2363280	And it seems let me I'm going to try and interpret what I think the
2364400	2366400	Your philosophy is and let me know if I get it right
2367600	2369600	I think
2370640	2372640	The downsides of being a nice guy
2373360	2378480	Although subtle and often completely opaque to the nice guys themselves. Yes
2379360	2381360	are
2381760	2383280	kind of
2383280	2385280	evident given
2385760	2390800	Can become evident given enough crowd sourcing of sense making so people and community
2391280	2394960	Come up with memes and characters in tv shows and stuff like that
2395120	2396880	right
2396880	2403920	The solution that the low resolution solution that then gets proposed is if x x being
2404400	2405520	nice guy
2405520	2407520	Is bad and doesn't get what you want
2408000	2412880	Then opposite of x y which is bad guy must be good
2413280	2415280	so the prevalence of
2415520	2418480	In you know, uh treat her like you don't like her
2419200	2423200	Like why women love chads like that kind of more
2423280	2424800	Um
2424800	2431840	Lethario approach to attracting women and and and getting what you want in life and sort of you know being ruthless and stuff
2432560	2434320	Is that a
2434320	2437600	an erroneous solution to the problem of nice kindness
2438720	2440320	it's
2440320	2445200	A core problem with what you just proposed is it is equally inauthentic
2445920	2450480	As as the other and it's equally attached to some external outcome
2450960	2452960	By trying to figure out how to do it right
2453600	2457520	Right. How about I just do this right again, then I'll get the women to approve of me
2457760	2462400	We're still in the same boat. We're just looking for a different right way of doing it now
2463360	2470960	As simple as this sounds, you know, like when I do like interviews with like a female coach that that maybe works with men
2471760	2472800	and um
2472800	2478800	And I say something that you know generalization like the feminine meaning all things feminine, you know women but
2479040	2482080	Dogs cats babies opportunity money weather whatever
2482720	2487280	I'll say is highly attracted to a man who's comfortable in his own skin
2488320	2490000	knows where he's going
2490000	2492080	And looks like he's having a good time going there
2492800	2496800	And the women, you know coaches interviewers podcasters on the call always go
2497600	2499600	Oh, yes
2500000	2506320	Okay, they're they're reacting kind of their nervous system is reacting to that thing. I didn't say the guy's an asshole
2506400	2509760	I didn't say he treats women bad. I didn't say doesn't give a fuck about
2510400	2513440	He he's he's centered in his own body
2513920	2518320	He's he's differentiated. He's asking himself. What do I want? What's important to me?
2518800	2524880	Following through on that, you know, not leaving the message behind not trying to be perfect not seeking anybody's approval
2525280	2527280	He's on mission. He's on purpose
2527520	2531920	And in my experience the feminine is highly attracted to that you don't have to work
2532560	2534560	At at getting the feminine to be attracted now
2534560	2537520	Are you always going to have feminine approval? I told someone the other day
2537520	2543040	This has never come out of my mouth before but I said actually there is no standard of feminine approval
2543680	2548800	But the feminine is not about standards. It's just about whatever is moving masculine at standards
2549120	2550640	You you go into the masculine world
2550640	2555280	You know when you've lived up to the standard when you've hit the ball out of the park when you've scored a touchdown
2555520	2561120	When you made ace when you you know made x amount of money the masculine doing standards are clear
2561360	2564480	We can go into that world and go I've achieved. I've made it
2564640	2566880	We have it. We have the stats rigorous. It's orderly
2567600	2569600	Requires something of you. There's discipline
2570080	2572560	The fat there is no such thing as feminine approval
2572720	2577840	I mean ask any guy even a woman who approved of them dearly in one moment
2578080	2581840	I'll ask them. Have you ever had experiences where the very next moment she was
2582160	2585440	unapproving of you and nothing about you had changed you had even
2585920	2591280	And guys all go yeah, isn't that the way it always works? Yeah, you know one minute when I was dating
2591440	2596080	I had women tell me robert. You're the most amazing man. I'm so glad I met you. I'm so grateful
2596320	2598800	I'm so happy and then never hear from them again
2599360	2605200	Or say robert, you know after two weeks, you know, I'm taking a break from dating or I'm giving my ex another try
2605440	2608800	And I'm going what just happened. That's the world of the feminine
2608960	2613840	It doesn't it isn't nailed down and orderly. So we we have to quit seeking
2614560	2616560	feminine approval
2616640	2621520	One of my certified coaches wrote a book that that I really like but there's a line in there
2621760	2624160	It said that a man does not mature
2624800	2627440	Until he quit seeking the love of a woman
2628720	2635600	As long as we're seeking love that's a feminine trait long as we're seeking to get that approval that love that validation from a woman
2636560	2638560	We're in a loop that there's no escape from
2639440	2645280	But when we when we can self validate when we're on purpose when we're living life on our terms
2645680	2650720	All of a sudden that makes us very attractive to the feminine. It will come to us. That's that's my experience
2651120	2652320	It will come
2652320	2656160	Now as soon as you turn and go, oh is here. How do I keep it? How do I make no no no?
2656400	2661120	We just blew it. All of a sudden now they're going to get that look on their face again. Like I go what I do wrong
2662000	2663280	so
2663280	2666800	If we take the how do I get the women's approval out of the equation
2666960	2670800	You're more likely to get it does that mean you just don't give a fuck don't care whatever
2671200	2673760	That's not what I'm again. It's not black and white
2674160	2678000	We we men want to make it black and white. It must be this or it must be that no
2678240	2680240	It's this this is
2680640	2686400	Another level that we rise to that lets us put a dent in the universe that lets us
2687120	2693840	Live with purpose and passion that lets us connect deeply with others that lets us be vulnerable and courageous
2694480	2696480	That actually invites the love
2697200	2700560	Into our life that that we desire rather than seeking it
2701600	2703760	Well, ultimately I was watching this um
2704560	2710480	Video from a lander botan from the school of life. Do you know that guy? British philosopher phenomenal insight
2711120	2715120	You were the second person who mentioned him in the last two or three days
2715200	2718240	I always pay attention when so whenever I hear someone's name like, you know
2718400	2722880	Whenever I heard you need to get on chris williamson's show when I heard that three times in the same week
2722960	2725600	You know, I thought wait a minute that name sounds familiar. Oh
2725600	2727600	Oh
2728480	2733120	I'm on he's on my calendar. What do you what do you know? It's um, so I use a
2733920	2737760	I'll just say what you're referring to he wrote an op-ed article in the new york times
2737840	2739200	Maybe 10 years ago
2739200	2745840	He's now the title was why you will marry the wrong wrong person. Yeah, I love I love that article. I copied it
2745920	2752080	It's it's just class. He's outstanding. Uh, I've he is on my mount rushmore of of of guests
2752080	2754880	He was very formative for me. Um, one of the reasons that
2755600	2758800	I'm gonna go on a tangent about why I love a lander botan
2759360	2761760	one of the reasons that I really love him is he's so
2762480	2764880	Softly spoken and he's so
2766080	2768080	embodied in the nuance of
2768960	2774960	Being fallible of how our emotions run the show. He's not posture. He's unbelievably smart
2775040	2781680	you know, he's very very well versed in renaissance art and history and poetry and and sculpture and and and
2782080	2784720	All all this stuff, but there's no posturing
2785520	2790640	From his left brain. Yeah, there's none of this sort of over rationality. He he
2791840	2798880	Accepts with complete face value the fact that we can be self contradictory and embarrassing and and all the rest of it
2798960	2801840	But anyway, he has he has this line in a video that I was watching recently
2802880	2804880	Where he talks about
2805040	2811360	A person whose greatest achievement would be after their death people would say they never made a fuss
2812400	2815920	Oh, they didn't make a fuss. They didn't you know, they didn't cause any ripples
2815920	2818800	They didn't make any waves and he's talking about largely
2820080	2826480	An equivalent of the nice guy this person who's you know overly pliable who's concerned about upsetting others who's doing all of this stuff
2827120	2831920	Anna, I just it really it really sort of struck home like oh my god, like that's the
2833600	2838560	That's the inheritance and the legacy which is waiting for you and ultimately
2839040	2841120	You can make it to the end of your life having
2841360	2847760	Either made all of the messes in the world or made zero messes at all depending on whether you go bad guy mode or nice guy mode
2849120	2851120	But
2851120	2854240	Like your legacy as you look back on your life is going to be one of
2854960	2856960	You playing a persona
2856960	2861120	You're never going to really be able to connect to any of the things that you do
2861760	2863760	people
2863760	2865760	accomplishments
2865760	2867760	praise compliments adoration
2868400	2869360	money
2869360	2871360	Because it wasn't you
2872160	2874160	that earned that
2874160	2876160	You didn't earn your money
2876800	2879200	The role that you're playing earned the money
2879680	2885280	The role that you're playing got the marriage the role that you're playing got the relationship or the job raise or
2885600	2889440	Or created the family or the the billion dollar company. It wasn't you
2890080	2892080	wasn't you
2892720	2894720	That's kind of messes with your head doesn't it
2895680	2897440	It's scary
2897440	2903600	You know when you were describing and I can't pronounce his name pronounce his name a land of botan. Oh, yeah, that's beautiful
2903840	2907200	When you are describing him i'm sitting there thinking i'm a straight guy
2907600	2910720	And that guy sounds sexy as hell the way you were destroyed. He's
2911760	2916320	I mean, he's got the classic philosophers build, but so be it. So be it
2917120	2919600	Here's something else. So here's something else that i've had in in my mind
2920000	2920720	um
2920720	2924640	Since looking at your work and kind of i've spent a lot of time over the last three years
2924960	2928240	Looking at evolutionary psychology mating dynamics so on and so forth
2930480	2932880	We don't see especially from women at the moment
2933520	2935520	Many conversations online
2935680	2940560	About nice guys about guys being too nice about guys being too pliable
2941040	2946080	A lot of the conversations skews toward guys being too toxic guys being too immature
2946480	2950160	But it's immature it it tends to be in a in a toxic manner
2950240	2952880	It's sort of the use and discard the use and abuse
2953600	2956000	The the very sort of transient transactional nature
2957920	2959920	What is the reason do you think?
2960320	2964960	That there isn't as much popularity if if and i don't disagree
2964960	2969760	I think that a huge problem will be the pliability and and dishonesty and niceness of men
2971360	2972960	Is it just less
2972960	2976640	Tweetable to to have that as the reason that you can't find met
2976640	2980160	I've got all of these men that keep bending over backward and keep doing things to me
2980320	2985040	Is it that it's kind of publicly unpopular for women to call that out because it seems like they're being ungrateful
2985280	2987280	What do you what do you think it is? Well?
2988640	2993280	Because i'm not in a woman's head. I I can't and because i'm not on social media
2993520	2996000	I also but I I do know what you're talking about
2996640	2999920	Of course, there are memes that that that run
3000720	3002400	and I
3002400	3006160	I do you know because I get a google uh notice every time
3006640	3012400	Nice guy, you know pops up somewhere. I I do see what when it does pop up it usually pops up and
3012880	3014880	write wing republican writing
3015120	3017120	um most often but
3017760	3019440	When women do
3019440	3021760	Write their blog articles about nice guys
3022320	3028640	It is most often how nice guys aren't nice of how they use basically the covert contracts of oh
3029040	3033040	I'm going to listen you talk about your problems. I'm going to pay your car payment this month. I'm going to
3033680	3039200	Pretend like I care about you and then when they you know ask the woman out or wanted to have sex
3039440	3042480	They goes no I never thought of you that way you're a friend, you know
3042800	3048400	And then the and then the guy of course that all that resentfulness that passive aggressive that rage comes out
3048800	3054080	And so, you know that meme does show up, but but it still ends up being toxic masculinity
3055360	3060960	Here is my thought and it sounds like you've looked a lot at this and you might even have a better perspective than me
3061920	3063920	My thought is that
3065200	3070240	You know, I grew up during whatever the wave of the angry feminism was in the 60s and 70s
3070240	3072000	I don't know if that's first wave second wave
3072000	3077520	But you know every man's a rapist and erections a sign of aggression and you know that already bought in my mother
3077840	3081120	You know my mother's generation with the first I think true feminists
3081440	3086480	She raised my my sister to not need a man raised her boys to be different from their father
3086720	3089520	You know that was kind of the beginning of that movement
3090400	3092400	and um
3093760	3094480	So
3094480	3098000	From that I grew up with I don't be like those bad men the women are complaining about so
3098320	3102240	So kind of the toxic masculinity meme has been around for a while
3102560	3107040	It just didn't have social media and now mainstream media mainstream me
3107040	3112640	I I can't even listen to like npr anymore because it's kind of like it's just gone so much to like
3112800	3117600	Let's just run fluff articles, you know fluff stories and stuff like that. I agreed. Um
3118240	3120240	I think
3120800	3122800	There had to be a pendulum swing
3123680	3131600	You know most of that's directed at patriarchy, you know now you just say patriarchy and like we all understand exactly what that means
3131680	3138080	It's evil, right? But but patriarchy was also providing protect, you know, there was also
3139040	3142960	Positives a part of it and was there an ownership mentality? Yeah
3143280	3147680	Did that lead to colonialism and you know abuses towards women and children? Yeah
3148240	3151360	Uh racism. Yeah, so yeah all of that
3152320	3156960	Well, you know when we make a social change we tend to throw the baby out with the bathwater
3157360	3164000	So, yeah, this was rail against this big idea of patriarchy toxic masculinity, you know
3164720	3169200	You know mansplaining man spreading everything that men do is bad kind of stuff
3169520	3171040	I
3171040	3177920	Think maybe it had to go to an extreme and and I think most sociologists that look at big shifts in society
3178320	3180720	Say when you have an oppressed people
3181200	3186240	Um the down drawing it almost has to become like a revolution. It has to be at the extremes
3186320	3192720	It doesn't have to be a correction. Yeah, it's not like a Gandhi that just you know, let's subtly create the shift
3193200	3196400	Um, so I think there has to be that over correction
3196800	3203280	And and you know, so we went through the hashtag me too where you know, men were you know, you know, accused tried
3203440	3209840	You know prosecuted and you know in the media lost jobs lost status purely because some woman said oh
3209840	3214480	I want to join the me too crowd, you know, and yeah, there was a lot of abuses that were being addressed
3214960	3217520	Should they've been addressed through social media?
3218400	3220640	I don't know if that was you know, the most
3221600	3225200	Democratic way to do it, but it's how it got done and then you know, yeah
3225440	3229280	If you you know publish something that gets a lot of likes and a lot of
3229600	3235680	Follows and yeah other people are going to publish it. So yeah, it went to the incentives aligned to make it happen
3235920	3242560	Of course they do and social media is all about algorithms and you know the more something shows up the more you see of it
3243040	3246320	Uh, that's why I told one of the reasons I don't like social media
3246880	3248080	um
3248080	3250080	But I actually think
3250080	3252080	That we're actually making an adjustment
3252640	3254640	You know, I I I saw articles
3255360	3259840	Yeah, a couple years ago likening anything that had to do with men's work
3260640	3263120	To like the oh there goes the balloons
3264160	3266160	Jesus christ
3266800	3270000	I didn't think it was gonna work. How have you managed to make balloons come up on this?
3270320	3272560	I promise I promise. I'm magic. Stop doing it
3273520	3279120	I I wish I yeah, I can't quit moving my hands now. The thumb will probably go up. Maybe maybe confetti
3279440	3282160	All right. All right. Okay. So even just a couple years ago
3282160	3288800	I saw articles about linking the january 6th, you know riots, you know in washington dc
3289520	3295200	To anything having to do with men's work like conflating that that all came out of the men's movement
3295840	3297280	and I'm going
3297280	3302560	And this was in main is washington post random article like that, right? So it's mainstream media
3304160	3306160	I think actually
3306160	3310240	That I think maybe we've reached that far enough far extreme
3310320	3312320	And I think maybe it's starting
3312320	3317360	So we're all of a sudden that's losing this interest is it seems to you know, oh, okay
3317440	3322240	There's another meme about toxic masculinity. Oh, there's another meme about andrew tape
3322320	3327040	There's another, you know, blah blah blah and people do get bored and now maybe in this because I'm
3327280	3330880	In the middle of men's work. It's what I've done for years
3331440	3336480	And I'm I'm in you know a men's program myself. I built a men's program. I believe in it
3337440	3345040	I I really do think we're moving to a better space that as men become more conscious
3345760	3349360	Um of the things that I think, you know, they teach they're valuable
3350000	3353280	You know being honest being transparent making their needs of priority
3353280	3358560	Surrounding themselves with people on how to get their needs met living with purpose living with passion, you know
3358640	3364080	Being generous making the world a better place being open-hearted being loving, you know quality good qualities
3365440	3367200	That I think
3367200	3370320	Is changing the world is shifting the dynamic
3371280	3377920	Women I think will begin to go that that's actually really attractive. That's that's sexy. That's better. I like that
3378480	3379600	and um
3379600	3384160	And I think there'll still be a few ones hanging on to but I let's all still stay mad at men
3384240	3389920	Let's you know, let's still and after a while, you know, one of the things that really was a big shock to me
3390480	3392480	I was probably in my 40s
3392560	3398080	When I was I was talking to you know a feminist and I mentioned somebody who identified as a feminist a woman
3398240	3402480	Maybe on an airplane and and I said, well, here's the feminism I grew up with
3403040	3406400	And she said, oh, you mean that every man's a rapist you you like
3406960	3408640	Believed all that I go
3408640	3413680	Well, it sure was because that was just a few angry pissed off women that got a lot of attention
3413920	3419040	I go that's all it was not all women felt that way. She goes no and they still don't I go
3419280	3425360	That's actually good to know that maybe all that noise that you know gets a lot of likes and follows
3425840	3427840	Maybe that doesn't represent
3427840	3434000	But even the majority of women there was a really wonderful term that I heard last year called the tyranny of the minority
3434960	3438400	And it happens. Yeah, I think that that explains it
3439040	3444080	Another way of putting it is the slowest dumb shit on the freeway is going to control how fast everybody can go
3444320	3447920	Very good. Yes. Yes. We're controlled by the extremes and the idiots
3448560	3450240	um
3450240	3455680	It's interesting to think about why that might be the case. I think that you've probably you're probably not far wrong that
3457840	3459840	It's still so popular to
3461200	3463200	fit men into the
3463200	3465040	impressive
3465040	3466640	tyrannical
3466640	3469680	patriarchal overbearing dominating controlling role
3470480	3471280	that
3471280	3477280	If women were to if a woman was to post online something which is more more honest, perhaps which would be
3477760	3482000	Um, I keep going out for men who are overly pliable and because they're so pliable
3482480	3485440	I'm concerned that they're not being honest with me
3486160	3490000	What does that sound like? Well, it sounds like a call for men to be less pliable
3490400	3494800	Which is not far away from men to be more aggressive more controlling
3495200	3500240	Writing a book that's called no more. Mr. Nice guy. Why would someone write a book teaching men to be not nice?
3500640	3502160	We do we do
3502160	3505760	Live in a black and white world and again media social media
3506240	3510400	Loves the black and white. It doesn't like nuance subtlety
3510960	3517120	That's the dangerous the real n word of 2024 is nuance. That's the real one that you shouldn't be saying
3517280	3520240	All right, so getting into getting into relationships, which are obviously
3521040	3523200	I think ground zero for a lot of this stuff
3523600	3527520	You know, you can kind of hide things away from yourself when it's on your own
3527600	3529920	And you're in and out of work and all the rest of it
3530000	3533920	If you know, everybody is emotionally connected with the work and everybody's emotionally connected with how
3534400	3536400	organized their source cupboard is
3537040	3544240	Relationships real ground zero. What do nice guys not understand about how female attraction works?
3544240	3552240	Well, most of us are believing what our mothers told us, you know, uh, if they told us anything
3552320	3554880	Which is to be nice to girls with my mother said be a gentleman
3555680	3559120	Okay, make sense. You know be a gentleman and I am
3559680	3564880	Uh, I'm a gentleman, but a woman taught me this one. Uh, I always open the door for women
3564960	3570160	I tell them wait for me. I'll open your door. Now if you really break it down, that's me being dominant
3570800	3573600	You know, I tell them what to do wait for me. I'm gonna open your door
3574320	3579120	And of the of the several hundred women who I've told to do wait for me. I'll open your door
3579680	3583520	Only one has pushed back against it and she pushed back for a while
3583680	3587520	Then all of a sudden she quit and kind of decided she actually really liked
3588160	3591920	Actually what she did is she jumped my bones in a public place and a very I said
3592880	3597380	We need to take this somewhere else after the while she's been pushing back against my dominance
3598080	3600080	so
3600720	3604080	For there to be attraction there has to be a polarity
3604640	3610080	And polarity involves dominance and submission. I know those are evil terrible words, you know
3610720	3616080	Because we think about dominant men, you know making women be submissive. You're in you're in a safe space here
3616880	3618880	I'm not I'm not sweating it
3618960	3621600	But yeah, it is okay. It is going out on the internet, which is fine
3622080	3628080	You know and what's happened is a polarity has just switched where the females have become dominant the dominant players
3628160	3632400	And the guys have become the submissive players and then the the women go
3632880	3636160	How come I can't find a guy that turns me on and the guys you're going?
3636400	3640720	How come I can't seem to turn women on? Well, it's it's is reversed a polarity
3641280	3646160	You you can't have polarity. That's attraction without dominance and submission
3646640	3649840	And the more subtle it is the more subtle the attraction is the more
3650160	3655360	Latent it is tends to be the more intensity attraction is we've probably all experienced that in one way or another
3655680	3659040	And I tell people you can't have sex without dominance and submission
3659280	3662800	Otherwise, there's two bodies lying next to each other waiting for something to happen
3663120	3666480	You know you gotta have a yeah, you know fight you have a top and bottom
3666480	3668880	You have a picture and catcher right there's got to be
3669440	3675280	A polarity now the beauty is that polarity can you can flip it around?
3675360	3679440	You know back and forth and I think in very conscious relationships
3680080	3683120	That that happens beautifully my wife's very strong
3683120	3687200	She grew up eight out of ten kids in poverty in guadalajara, mexico
3687600	3692000	alcoholic father got beat on by family members beat on by neighbors
3692400	3696400	You know abused by family members abused by priests, you know, she's she's been through
3696480	3703360	You know, she goes to the gym two hours a day. She can out squat me easily. She's done my thigh. I don't I don't piss her off
3703840	3706320	Um, you know, she can get shit done
3706720	3710960	I grew up in a middle class white bread neighborhood of seattle washington
3711360	3717040	Surrounded by bowing engineer families, you know, it's just you know, I never had to fight for anything
3717520	3719520	Okay, so she's tough
3719600	3722320	But she doesn't she's always told me I love it when you tell me no
3722720	3726960	She goes, I don't I don't want to be in charge. I don't want you to always ask me what what you know
3726960	3730160	What do you want to do? She she likes it when I make we're walking to a restaurant
3730560	3734400	And you know, though here in mexico and they'll say no they'll say should I the last curtain?
3734480	3737760	Should I get the waiter say should I give him a menu in english? She goes no
3738000	3741200	He lives in mexico give him one in spanish and I'll say yeah
3741760	3743760	Give my wife and kids the menu in english
3744000	3746640	And then they hand her a menu and she goes no, he's my boss
3746720	3749760	He'll order for me and they always laugh about that and I say yeah
3749920	3753920	I get to be the boss when she says I can't you know, so we got those the whole stick down
3754480	3759680	But the truth is she is strong. She's powerful. She can get shit done. She can kick ass
3760160	3762720	But she doesn't want to be in that mode all the time
3763200	3767200	She wants to to be led. She wants to submit. She wants to open
3767440	3772160	She wants to be done too in blissful kinds of ways. Well, that's my job
3772560	3778960	Right. So and even though I'm kind of more that I'm I'm go along to get along. I you know, I'm yeah
3779040	3782080	This or that either one's okay with me. I'm kind of more that way
3782720	3784720	She doesn't like it when I'm that way
3784720	3791520	So for her she's happiest when I will play the default lead the default decision maker
3791840	3795120	But she likes it best when I said here's what I was thinking. What do you think?
3796000	3799280	You know, I don't just say what do you think, you know, what do you want?
3799520	3803680	I'll say, you know, I was thinking a white with a little bit of tint of gray in it
3803760	3804800	What do you think?
3804800	3809200	You know, she wants me to to to lead that and then she'll feel the polarity and then she'll tell me
3809360	3812000	What she thinks or wants and then you just say you decide
3812640	3815120	Okay, let's go. Let's go. Let's go pick out the paint
3815760	3821200	Um, am I being abusive to her by being dominant? No, I've heard so many women tell me
3821520	3828160	When the guy leaves it all up to them to comply it the women feel burdened by that most are in their masculine
3828880	3832480	dominant role all day long in their work in their career
3832880	3839760	Raising children even mothering is a masculine dominant state to be in you're taking care of kids needs
3840400	3844160	That's not feminine. I don't them want to have to take care of your partner after that
3844480	3848080	Yeah, then then when the guy says oh, I don't get you want to have sex tonight
3848080	3853200	Would you or what do you want for and it's just one more thing that they got to check off there to do is
3853600	3855280	They don't want that
3855280	3861120	Now am I making a generalization? Yeah. Is it fluid? Yeah. Is it nuanced? Yeah
3861520	3866720	Is it okay? The guy's always got to be the dominant the woman's but no that's not what I'm saying
3867200	3872640	But for for men when I start talking about them consciously setting the tone and leading in relationship
3873200	3875200	When I say that to a nice guy
3875680	3881760	The response he usually he'll pondering okay, dr. Glover what I hear you say when you say take control
3881760	3887120	I go no no you did not hear me say the word take control. I did not say it
3887600	3893600	I don't believe in it. I'm talking about you lead you set the tone you state what you want where you want to go
3893680	3897680	What you want to eat and and and give her a chance to follow like on the dance floor
3897920	3899920	She can't follow where you don't lead
3900000	3902000	Give her that and then
3902000	3906640	Be open to a discussion be open to her taking the you know setting the tone and leading
3906800	3911200	But it's not about but guys nice guys will say when you know when you said take control
3912480	3915120	Is more nuanced than that but again
3916080	3918400	So that that that's my job is helping guys
3918960	3922240	Apply the the nuance that that word of 2024
3922960	3925360	What is the role of emotional tension?
3926480	3928480	Oh, you've done some research
3929280	3933280	Yeah, that's a cute little wink of the high that just it was just flirting with you. I'm just
3933680	3936480	It's reflexive. I'm just trying to flirt with you. Yeah
3937520	3944080	I know the girls like it. Probably the boys do too. I I live in a very gay community. So, you know
3944640	3946560	I know how it is
3946560	3951920	Okay, so the role of emotional tension. There we go. We just had emotional tension going on right there. Yep
3953280	3956800	I'm gonna I'm gonna make a generalization that doesn't apply to everybody
3957280	3962160	But it does seem to apply to a lot and that's the generalized statement is
3962640	3966720	Is that in general for women to experience attraction?
3967120	3969120	Say towards a man
3969200	3976400	Arousal and to stay attached to that man over time. She has to experience some kind of emotional tension
3976960	3983200	She's got to feel something the butterflies and this the that the drama that does he love me doesn't love me
3983200	3988400	And we men can kind of understand that a little bit. We kind of like the tension we feel of go
3989200	3993120	Feel it's nice, you know like her boobs whatever, you know, that creates attention for us
3993440	3998000	But in general men don't like emotional tension, especially in relationship
3998640	4004560	If you even think about, you know, our sporting events where we do get our tension and clocks on them
4004880	4009360	You know, we know it's going to end at this time. That's why baseball is falling out of favor
4009520	4013840	That's why they put a clock on baseball. They put the they put the pitch clock last year
4014160	4019440	Yeah, you know, how many times you can throw it at first, you know, because oh, we got to have it on a clock
4019600	4023040	You know, so um, so men's tension is on the clock
4023520	4029200	Oh, yeah, I I know this, you know, this this adventure flick i'm watching in the hero
4029200	4034240	This is happening. I know he's gonna get out of it and it's gonna be done in 35 minutes, you know, it's done
4034320	4037680	We're done. Shoot go home kick back into nothingness, right?
4038640	4041760	The feminine never gets tired of tension the feminine if it
4042240	4045600	If it isn't feeling tension is bored. It will create tension
4046160	4049120	And so that's what's hard for men to understand, you know
4049360	4052880	We think to be nice to women will make them be attracted to us
4053040	4057840	But nice creates absolutely no attention no tension really for anybody
4058400	4063200	Men or women, but we think well, that's what mom told me to do. Go be go go be nice to them
4063200	4068800	It's what that's what I in junior high all the women were complaining about those jerks who create attention for them
4069200	4075200	And so I listened to her complain about the jerk since she kept going back to the jerk even after you know, I'm such a nice guy
4076560	4081680	So in general women need that emotional tension watch it. They create it within themselves
4082160	4086000	Um and and we guys if we have any kind of tension between us
4086400	4091120	We'll just have it out. Maybe we'll punch each other and then we'll be done. We'll go have a beer. It's all good, you know
4091840	4095760	We don't need to keep going back into that tension state to have a bond have a connection
4096080	4098560	Well, we'll go do something together. We may go compete
4098800	4102880	We may go bring our a game and leave it all on the field, but then we walk off arm and arm
4103680	4107520	So it's just the the the difference between that masculine and feminine
4107520	4112640	So the hardest part for men to understand is that the women need that tension. So even when
4113760	4115760	I say wait for me. I'll open your door
4116240	4120160	And now I create a little bit of dominance and she waits for me. That's tension
4120880	4124480	All right, it's just a little bit. It's a little subtle, you know, even like, you know
4124640	4127920	Say hey, put the menu down. I'll order for us tonight
4128320	4132720	There's tension and I'm not being nice. It's actually creating something. What's he gonna order for?
4132880	4136560	Is he gonna pick something? I like do I trust him? Is it gonna be an adventure?
4136800	4141440	You know, I tell guys and you know and you know guys will think it's game playing
4141440	4146720	And it kind of can look like that and but the the real thing is it's actually just is how do we get more conscious?
4146960	4148960	So I'll tell a guy for example, you know
4148960	4155440	If a woman sends you a message text message or calls you and if you reply right away or you pick up the phone and answer
4155840	4158480	How much tension will the woman experience through that?
4159440	4163360	Well, well, none we've relieved it as soon as we answered the phone or tension went away
4163760	4165760	But what if you didn't answer it?
4166000	4168720	What if you called her back in 30 seconds 45 seconds
4169360	4172560	An hour and she goes, where were you? Why didn't you answer?
4173120	4175360	And what if you didn't give her an answer to that?
4176000	4181280	And she's going why didn't he answer? What was he doing now? Here's the thing because those guys
4182000	4186400	Ten if we do have emotional tension, we like what I call positive emotional tension
4186640	4189680	You know, it it feels good to us where you're at
4190480	4197440	For the for women they don't care. Is it positive emotional tension? Is it is it pet or is it net negative emotional tension?
4197680	4199920	They don't care emotional tension is emotional tension
4200320	4205280	And so, you know, it means, you know, them starting a fight, you know them doing something knows
4205360	4208560	They know it's going to piss us off. It's kind of like they don't care
4208800	4210400	They got our attention
4210400	4213440	And and that's all that mattered. They got our attention and there's tension
4213600	4219120	And and even the thing of guys like listening to women talk about the problems. I tell guys there's a an
4219840	4221040	inverse
4221040	4226160	negative relationship between the amount of time a man spends listening to a woman talk about her problems
4226560	4228880	And the likelihood he's going to get laid what you mean
4230000	4234400	It means that if you say and listen to talk about her problems, you've actually relieved all of her tension
4234880	4238960	Tensions flowed completely out of because you know, she talked she talked she talked all the tension
4239280	4242640	Came away and what I tell guys is then you end up looking like
4243120	4247760	Her girlfriend with a penis and odds are she doesn't want to have sex with her girlfriend
4248240	4251760	So anything we do to relieve their tension
4252400	4256160	Actually works against us and robs them kind of like we talked about earlier
4256240	4258640	Are we going to rob them of the joy of doing for us?
4258880	4265600	Well, are we going to rob them of the emotional tension that they have to have to feel to feel something
4266160	4268160	To to want to engage
4268720	4271280	You had this fantastic example
4272080	4274480	of how emotional tension
4275200	4278400	is enjoyed differently by men and women by the
4279520	4282800	story arcs of romantic comedies and how men and women
4283600	4286960	Uh, experience experience that can you explain that?
4287120	4292080	Well, you mean like, you know, you you take your woman to watch titanic and she titanic
4292160	4296400	You know, she's already seen it eight times and she walks away with her panties wet thinking outcome
4296640	4302000	I can't have that and the guy the guy's checking his watch checking his phone his fort center on yet
4302080	4308000	How do I get out of here? I I thought what was particularly interesting was you you explaining and it really sort of hit home to me that
4308400	4311680	Uh, if you're a man who's watching a romantic comedy you see
4311920	4313120	um
4313120	4316400	regulation at the beginning everything is is fine
4316640	4320000	Then you see dysregulation something happens and everything goes up in the air
4320160	4322080	Then you see regulation again or more like
4322720	4329200	Middle movie regulation whether the couple first starts to get together and you're like, oh, well, I mean that's it like let's go home
4329200	4333680	The movie's done. Yes done. Whereas what the woman then wants is this protracted
4334160	4336640	Oh, but the ex-girlfriend's back in the picture
4336720	4339920	But oh my god, he hasn't got his right visa and he's going to be deported
4339920	4345040	How are they going to keep the relationship going and it's just protracted and protracted and protracted and protracted and then
4345360	4347680	I don't I don't know what it's like to be a woman at the end of a rom-com
4347680	4348640	But it may be
4348640	4353600	Unsatisfying for there to be a conclusion. It's like what could we just let's roll it for another three hours
4353600	4357360	Let's just continue to extend this and that's maybe we're bollywood figured it out
4357360	4360960	Let's just do the wedding scene everybody's dancing to a real upbeat song
4360960	4364080	We know it's over but now they'll do a part two of it
4364640	4366400	um
4366400	4368400	and you know
4369120	4373360	Women I've been in relationship with learned don't take me to a romantic comedy
4373840	4378640	I'm sitting there going that is so fucking unrealistic. That doesn't happen in the real world
4378960	4385280	How come every guy has a job he doesn't actually have to go to how come every woman's a fashion editor in every one of these
4385520	4391600	Yeah, I know he loves dogs, but he lives in this new york loft and makes canoes. That's how he supports himself
4391840	4393840	Come on. That's not real. Yes
4394320	4399920	Yeah, you don't want to go to a romantic comedy with me because I live in the world of could that really be real
4400000	4402720	Could that really happen? Do people really do that?
4404000	4406880	No, you know, that's not how the real world works
4407120	4411120	But it creates emotional tension and so that's really what it is all about
4411120	4417840	It's not about reality the masculine wants to go resolve all the emotional tension to get us back into reality
4418240	4421760	So yeah, I it's it's really hard for me to watch a romantic comedy
4421840	4427360	Just twiddle my thumbs and just not not say anything. Oh, it's excruciating. So
4428320	4430320	thinking about this
4430320	4432320	Dynamic that we have this emotional tension
4432800	4436800	this amount of of dominance and and uh direction
4437360	4440800	Uh and and suggestion that comes from the man. Um
4442000	4445520	There will be women listening and out there who
4446320	4450880	Enjoy they're writing a blog article about us right now. It's fine. It's added to the list
4451600	4453600	But there will be women listening who?
4454240	4459120	Maybe a little conflicted or there will be men who imagine that the woman might be conflicted because you say well
4459600	4465600	She wants she comes home. She's had a difficult day at the work because kelly that bitch in the cubicle next door
4465600	4468720	Has done that thing again that pisses her off and the woman
4469440	4473920	Wants to be able to vent. She also wants her man to listen to her
4474320	4476320	and it's this odd duality of
4477680	4479680	Not knowing what's best for us
4479840	4484640	And of the things that we want not always being in our best interests and you
4485120	4491120	Quoted the best onion article which is woman turns man into a partner. She doesn't want to be with
4491760	4496800	I I got the article the headline alone is is enough right, you know
4498480	4502080	And and again, this is this is the dance of relationship
4502080	4506880	Wouldn't it be great if you know, we could just say guys just do it this way every woman's going to like it
4507760	4509760	No, it doesn't work that way
4510240	4515600	And but what what you said what was really true is that yeah, so for example
4515920	4520240	You know the woman in your life's been in her masculine all day doing at work
4520640	4525920	Putting up with asshole managers asshole customers asshole clients asshole core workers
4526240	4530640	And now, you know, she comes home. There's one more asshole now is putting demands on her
4531280	4533280	So for example
4533440	4539120	Um, the woman that folded my clothes that I mentioned again, I met her at the mall as she sold me shoes
4539520	4544960	And when after we started dating, um, one of the things where we really clicked is she liked baseball
4545360	4547360	I like baseball
4547360	4550160	Rangers fine. I could have been part of a threesome. It would have been great
4550880	4552880	There we go. You're flirting again
4553040	4557040	But but you lost to me as soon as you said Texas Rangers, you know
4557520	4563360	Hey, those of us with the world series championship in the last year. Yeah, you're you're the we you're the homer
4563440	4568720	Yeah, we we won the world series. Let me see the ring man. Show show me the ring. Okay, so, um
4570480	4574880	She liked baseball so, you know, she'd get off work four or five o'clock in the afternoon
4574960	4579280	I'd already have a bar stool staked out at the roost chris that was right next to you know, where she worked
4580000	4583760	Couple baseball games are already on the screen at the bar
4584000	4587200	They have this great half rice hamburger during happy hour
4587520	4592800	She'd come in and she would just start, you know, I'd already have the wine ordered sitting there
4593120	4596880	You know, the you know the appetizers that come and she's like this about her day
4597200	4600720	Like that. She's been in her mask in all day. I would take out my phone
4601840	4607680	Set it at five minutes and say you have my undivided attention for five minutes. Put the phone on the bar
4608080	4611520	I would give her eye contact. I would face her
4612160	4614000	I would listen
4614000	4616000	undivided attention
4616400	4622480	She would run out of steam before five minutes was up because she's going I sit here complaining
4622480	4626960	But there's a baseball game on and there's a glass of wine sitting here. What do I prefer?
4627440	4630480	Before now if I didn't put her on the clock at five minutes
4630560	4635200	It was a game it was me being dominant but in a loving playful if I didn't put her on the clock
4635520	4636480	She might
4636480	4642800	Be crabby all night long and she would not enjoy herself because one of the things I found is that for
4644080	4647920	Somebody who identifies as feminine to be in their masculine all day
4648240	4651360	Are often not good at getting themselves out of that masculine
4651760	4654480	I got to go home and wash dishes and get the laundry done
4654560	4657120	There's things we got to do before I got to get up and go to work tomorrow
4657360	4661440	I'll sit down. I have a glass of wine. Tell me about your day. Let me rub your feet
4661920	4664640	I'm a big fan of of in a sense
4665200	4671440	Leading her back into her feminine out of that masculine rigid get shit done kind of state of mind
4671760	4675840	And now all of a sudden she begins opening and she'll tell me your attention
4676000	4679680	I might even say a woman taught me this. I'll say, you know what? I want to hear about your day
4679680	4681680	But give me the guy version
4682000	4686960	You know, and I've never had a woman ask me. What does that mean? I'll say you you want me to be your guy, right?
4687360	4690880	Yeah, yeah, all right, then I need the guy version when you tell me about the day
4691120	4694640	Please translate about how Kelly and the cubicle next to her, you know
4695200	4699680	And I know why she does it because you just insecure and she's always wanting attention and she always takes it out of me
4700640	4701840	Dear
4701840	4705280	I love you. Give me the guy version. Kelly pissed me off today. Great
4706000	4708000	Now I understand why you had a bad day
4709280	4711040	So, you know
4711040	4713440	Get playful with it get playful with it
4713440	4719920	There's definitely one of the common threads that I'm noticing through a lot of the dynamics is a degree of playfulness and
4720560	4723600	It's my nature. So it is what I bring and
4724560	4728240	You know, it's it's helping it's helping to it's helping to relieve the tension
4728960	4730960	relieve the tension it's helping to relieve the
4731760	4732880	seriousness
4732880	4736080	Of everything that that it it gives more play
4736640	4741280	It gives like in the engineering term it gives more room within the system for things to breathe
4741520	4745360	You make a suggestion, but it's not it's not done in too
4746480	4750240	Rigid of a fashion. There's there's there's movement in there and it's done
4750320	4754720	It's evident the reason that you're doing it and it's not in a mocking way. It's not in a passive aggressive way
4755120	4759520	It's not in a condescending or patronizing way, but the reason that this I think
4760160	4765120	Works is it shows. Hey, look like we're here to enjoy our time together
4765120	4767600	we're here you're here to enjoy we're here to enjoy this and
4768080	4773760	Whether it's someone's had something good happened. Someone's had something bad happened. Someone's sad. Someone's mad. Someone's whatever
4775280	4778160	The appropriate amount of playfulness I can struggle to think of
4778800	4781440	Really many situations in which it doesn't make it better
4783280	4784640	Yeah, I
4784640	4790880	And that doesn't mean getting silly and everything's a joke because again guys will kind of like oh, you mean make a joke about it
4791680	4792960	and again
4792960	4794960	teaching men
4794960	4796960	to to be lighthearted
4797200	4800160	But that that that can be a pretty daunting task
4800320	4804240	Yeah, um now what's funny though if you get men with men
4805200	4809760	And and let them just kind of begin to let their hair down guys get silly with each other
4810400	4813600	And you know and but we're I think we're afraid of showing that to women
4814000	4817200	Oh, yeah, I won't I won't appear manly. I won't be you know
4817600	4820960	It's a degree of there's a degree of competence. I think
4821520	4826640	Uh, I certainly noticed this. Do you know who charlie hoop it is from charisma on command?
4826960	4832880	He's got a very big charisma channel on youtube. It really really great guy very embodied ton of self work ton of men's work
4834000	4835200	and
4835200	4836400	he
4836400	4839600	Helps mostly men but also women become more charismatic
4840000	4846240	So he's he's learned the principles of confidence and charisma and um one of the best tools that he
4847120	4850240	teaches is when people ask a question
4850880	4853200	The best answer isn't always the right one
4854160	4860240	And you know he uses this example of um, how to overcome your discomfort around trying to be funny
4860560	4863920	And he says if you walk out of the house and you're with people you walk out of a bar
4864320	4869600	Or whatever and the weather is one extreme of either hot or cold make a joke about it being the opposite
4869680	4874960	Yeah, and he was like it's the shittest joke. It is the worst. It's a pure dad joke
4875360	4880560	But he said it'll get a chuckle out of people if you walk outside and it's freezing hot and you go dude
4880560	4882560	Wish I'd brought some shorts today. This is great
4882720	4886880	um like people have a little bit of a chuckle about but it really really
4887760	4890640	Showed me and I have a friend george who's been on the show a lot
4891840	4894800	He a lot of the time if you're playing kind of like a game of tennis
4894960	4900560	So you're playing a game of tennis which involves a linear conversation. Here is a question. There is an answer
4900560	4903600	Here is a question. There is an answer. Here's another answer. Here's another question
4903920	4908240	And you played this back and forth. He regularly hits the ball sideways
4908960	4914880	So he'll call back to a thing that happened a couple of weeks ago or he'll say, oh, you know
4914960	4919200	I bet that such and such a famous person from the media would have done that or whatever like he'll
4920320	4925280	Rip the conversation out like orthogonally from where it is and there's play in that
4925520	4930880	He's not answering the question because he he has the comfort in himself to not need
4932240	4936400	To get validation by being I am the person that always knows the answer
4936880	4942160	I am the person that is always able to give the the correct conclusion that draws the line that puts the full stop
4942160	4943760	And dots the eyes and crosses the t's
4943760	4946880	I don't need to be that person and it's such a breath of fresh air
4947200	4951680	Because you're having this conversation and and you're like, I'm excited. I don't know what's gonna and it
4952560	4956560	Engenders that in you as well, but there's definitely like good boy energy
4957520	4959520	a nice guy energy in
4960000	4963520	I will answer the question properly. I will ensure that this
4964480	4970400	Somebody's asked something of me and to deliver it. I shall and that removes the playfulness. Yeah, you know and
4971040	4975680	When I work with guys around this again when I said when I learned to date in my 40s and 50s
4975760	4979840	I you know, I was never good with women and if I got one I kept them way too long
4980400	4985920	And I started getting successful, you know with dating and getting laid and guys said Robert teach us
4986640	4988480	I'm not a dating guru
4988480	4993840	But what you're talking about is it again for most of the men I worked with they get so afraid
4993920	4999280	I'm gonna do something wrong. I'm gonna make a mistake. I'm gonna piss her off. I'll blow it and then then it's irreparable
4999760	5001760	and I'd say, you know just
5002400	5006720	Toucher don't you know if you have the impulse to touch or touch her if you have the impulse to tease your teaser
5006800	5008720	If you have the impulse to tell her come on. Let's go do this
5009280	5010960	Don't hold back
5010960	5012960	It's crazy as it sounds. I tell guys
5013520	5015520	Blurt and act on impulse
5015760	5017760	You think that's a recipe for disaster
5017760	5024720	But the truth is it lets them be themselves because their authentic self comes out and you know, I've had so many experiences
5025040	5028160	You know around one if I just blurted acted on impulse
5028480	5031680	You know, I remember one woman I dated on the second date
5031840	5034560	We were going to go for a walk and she said, well, let me go use the restroom
5035760	5039680	Restaurant and she went to the restroom came back and I so I'm gonna go use the restroom
5039680	5042000	I said by the way enjoyed watching you walk away from me
5042560	5045440	And as soon as I said it, I thought oh fuck. I probably blew it, you know
5046160	5048720	After we broke up we stayed friends and said
5049360	5052880	Months later said you remember when you said that to me said, yeah, I thought I blew it
5052960	5058080	He goes, oh no, I loved it. Well, I it I just blurted it right. I didn't hold it back
5058560	5064800	I remember another another woman early early first date where we're walking and she said something about her
5066000	5070960	Her sister or sister-in-law they're they're having a shoe party, you know, where women get together and
5071840	5073840	Look at shoes
5074240	5080800	The lamest thing a tupperware. I can think of the a shoe party lamest party in history
5080800	5085680	But okay, and so I blurted without thinking oh shoe shopping is women's porn
5086400	5088480	She turned and looked at me and she goes
5089520	5091520	You get it you understand
5092320	5098000	You know and and and so guys will say well, I'm not funny, you know, I'm not I'm not, you know, I can't
5098480	5100480	I'm not talking about telling jokes
5100480	5103680	I'm talking about whatever that thing that came to the tip of your brain
5104320	5105680	But you held it back
5105680	5110320	Yeah, because you're afraid it might be the wrong thing to say the wrong thing to do as soon as you held it back
5110560	5116880	You killed the tension the putting it out there and sometimes you crash and burn, you know, there's the sweat flops
5116960	5122960	You go, oh man, that didn't get one laugh, you know, but you got to take that risk every comedian
5123440	5125440	You know has had plenty of bombs
5125760	5128400	to but man that one landed and
5128960	5132880	And it's not about trying to get it right. It's about taking the sensors off
5133520	5138080	And letting that you that maybe just speaks to the obvious
5138800	5143680	Out there and people people they'll relate to it or they won't it seems a lot like
5145040	5146720	one of the key
5146720	5148240	tactics for
5148240	5151200	Rehabilitating a nice guy is learning to kind of get out of your own way
5151200	5158160	That's a good way to put it because what we've been doing is again go all the way back to where we began this
5158720	5163600	They've been trying to manage their shame. I'm bad. I'm not good enough. I'm gonna be found out. I'm gonna die
5164000	5168000	Their anxiety. Oh, no, somebody will react negatively. There'll be pain involved
5168560	5172400	And so that is what's driving the bus is their shame and their anxiety
5172800	5176960	And so who is really in there? You know, who is the person?
5177760	5178960	Um
5178960	5183040	One of the things the comments I get from people that work with me or you know
5183840	5187760	Come to my workshops or seminars or do calls with me. They'll say robert
5187840	5189920	I appreciate how how authentic you are
5190560	5191680	And I'll go
5191680	5193920	Nobody would have accused me of that 30 years ago
5194480	5199040	Nobody would have said robert. I love how real you are how authentic you are how you just share yourself
5199600	5202320	How you share your mistakes you fuck ups. I didn't
5202880	5207200	And and I couldn't attract a woman to save my life, you know back back in those days
5207200	5212960	I I kind of could but I I didn't know that what I was what I did that might attract a woman
5213200	5217200	But I wasn't real. I wasn't authentic. I was holding my finger up checking the wind
5217200	5221520	I was a chameleon, you know, what's what's gonna give me the most laughs or what's gonna give me, you know
5222560	5227440	What will kind of go over well, but not too well that you know now I'm not on the spot that I got to follow through
5228080	5228800	and
5228800	5230800	man to just take the sensors off
5231120	5232720	and just
5232720	5235120	Blurt act on impulse be you
5235840	5240480	I think is such a powerful rehabilitation and since most nice guys
5241040	5245440	Their sensors are the most prominent with women. That's a great place to go practice
5247520	5251680	One of my the same friend I was talking about before mr. Orthogonal tennis game george
5252080	5256960	He he has this idea called only the irrational behavior survives. What he's talking about
5257760	5259760	What he's talking about is he imagines
5260160	5263360	being at the funeral of somebody that he knows and he
5263920	5268720	Thinks about the conversations that the people are having around the room and they're not having the conversation
5269360	5273760	The washing was always folded and he turned up on time and all the rest of it
5273920	5277360	He uses this example of his mum and he says that his mum hates fighting
5277680	5281840	Just really just does not like physical fighting big big problem with it
5282320	5288160	And once his brother was in the car his younger brother was in the car with her and they were driving somewhere and she
5288880	5290880	I don't know 50s year old woman
5291200	5293200	Normal british woman saw two
5293840	5298720	18 year old boys sort of squaring up to each other and pushing and trying to fight or whatever on the side of the
5298880	5301920	On the pavement. She stops the car in the middle of traffic
5302640	5306880	Gets out and runs over and the brother's like mum. What the fuck are you doing?
5306880	5308880	Like what the two guys
5309600	5312640	Twice your size and quadruply a testosterone. What the fuck are you doing?
5312880	5316640	She runs over and she gets in between them physically gets in between them like no fighting no fighting
5316880	5319040	Gets back in the car and the brother's like mum. That was
5319520	5324000	Insane, you could have been hurt. You could be what she's I don't care. I don't care. I just don't like fighting no one's fighting
5324480	5326880	and he said at her funeral
5327760	5332240	People will say she was the sort of person that would stop the car in the middle of traffic to stop two boys fighting
5332640	5338720	And it's like that only the irrational behavior survives is is similar to what you're talking about that there are rough edges
5339440	5340480	to
5340480	5342480	our personality and our behavior
5343120	5349600	But ultimately that is our personality and behavior like if your goal your goal should not be as a person on this planet
5350000	5355760	to smooth out any of the things that make you anything into this sort of
5356560	5358560	vanilla amorphous
5358560	5361360	blob that kind of like just glides
5362080	5367920	Through it's like no you have things that you want to say and actions that you want to take and changes that you want to make
5368400	5371520	And just the faith to be able to do that unencumbered
5372240	5373040	is
5373040	5378480	That's what life is. Yeah, and and it takes support. It takes practice
5379120	5380160	um
5380160	5383760	Yeah, you know talking no more mr. Nice guy about nice guys being teflon men
5384400	5387440	No stick, you know, nothing. I don't want anything to stick to me
5387520	5394720	But we do connect as you said around our rough edges, you know, what we remember about people might not even been always a thing
5395520	5400160	It might even bugged us or got on our nerves when they did it and we're around them
5400480	5403120	But it's also the thing we miss. I mean, you know
5404080	5409120	Nala the pit bulls back at my my door again. I've got french glass doors so I can see her outside my office
5409520	5413680	Yeah, you know when she barks during, you know, I'm on an interview a podcast
5413760	5418160	It really bugs me but you know if I didn't have her and I'd notice
5419040	5420160	Oh, I miss her bark
5420960	5425840	You know, I love when she'd go crazy and let me know that somebody was out front our handyman
5426080	5430880	The the water guys deliver a while they call my dog's name because they know she'll bark differently
5431200	5436160	When she's had her name called and well and I would miss that if it if it ever went I go
5436160	5439920	What's wrong with Nala? How come she doesn't bark at people outside anymore?
5440160	5447200	Yeah, it's it's it's rough edges bore, you know, all that smooth get it right. No, you know, that's boring
5448320	5451040	Why is your first sexual experience so important?
5452240	5454240	You talking about mine
5457920	5460400	Come on, even that's too far for me. Um, yeah
5461600	5465600	First sexual experience. Why is it very formative? Okay, you know
5466320	5468320	That
5469360	5470240	That's a good question
5470240	5474160	But it's also difficult one to answer because our first sexual experience is probably
5475120	5478480	Conception, you know, I'd say birth. We're born sexual
5478640	5485920	We're the the essence of who we are is sexuality every living thing is built to reproduce
5486320	5490000	After its own so our sexuality is the essence of who we are
5490320	5496880	We we kind of live culturally thinking well, you know, children don't become sexual until you know that
5497360	5499360	particular age whatever that might be
5499920	5501920	but the truth is, you know
5502400	5506640	Little boys little girls discover their body parts that are very young age
5507200	5512160	Oh, there's pleasure before you, you know, they understand the words of parents don't stop doing that, you know
5512480	5516000	They're they're they're they're finding the pleasure in their own body parts
5516560	5522560	And the essence of our psyche is is is our our sexuality, you know, if
5523360	5527600	So many great teachers, you know all the way from from Freud
5528080	5536720	To david data to osho to david snarch people at least i value talk about the the most profound way into who we are
5537280	5544000	Young is to our sexuality because it is the essence of who we are. So to bring that back to answering your question
5544240	5548960	I will often ask people like in a workshop, you know, again, I primarily work with men these days. Well
5549760	5551760	I 100% work with men these days
5552240	5553440	I'll ask them
5553440	5560240	What was your earliest sexual memory and it doesn't matter what it was first time you notice you had an erection first kiss first wet dream
5560800	5564320	First i'll show you mine. You show me yours first, whatever
5565200	5568800	Uh, and it can vary for you every what but i'll just say what is your first memory?
5569920	5572720	And then i'll say get it get clear in your mind. What was it?
5572960	5574960	And then i'll ask them
5575760	5577760	Did it occur in the open?
5577920	5579920	Could you go tell your folks about it?
5580000	5581760	Could it be celebrated?
5581760	5587280	Did your parents say that's amazing. Let's go get pizza. That's a you know, it's a developmental milestone
5587840	5594640	Um, or was it hidden? Was it secretive? Was it guilt-ridden? Was it shame-based?
5595280	5600320	Uh, even worse. Did it feel good? But you felt bad about it feeling good
5600880	5602560	All right, so
5602560	5608640	For about 99.9 of the people on the planet our earliest sexual experience
5609200	5611200	Was wrapped in shame
5611360	5615840	And in hidden darkness guilt i'm bad. I can't let anybody find out
5616720	5620880	So our sexuality gets cross-wired with those features
5621600	5623680	It's bad it's evil hide it
5624160	5626880	Repress it don't let it out and then that takes
5627520	5633280	You know as many different forms as there are people in terms of how that manifests from from there
5633760	5638400	So then we get to be adolescents and adults and can't figure out why
5639200	5641920	Sex is so messy so difficult so challenging. So
5642560	5645600	You know, how come isn't work how come how come it's not easy?
5646000	5649440	Yeah, people who think that they have a a low sex drive
5650080	5652080	Might actually just be
5652640	5654240	psychologically scarred from
5654240	5656080	The way that they perceived it
5656080	5659440	That's very possible. I and I've I've often said, you know, I
5660960	5665120	Will get personal I didn't discover I didn't know I could actually masturbate myself to
5665760	5671600	Ejaculation until I was a freshman in college. That's pretty late compared to most and and you know
5671600	5674480	I was kind of a late bloomer in a lot of ways around sexuality
5674960	5676480	And I was just well, that's just me
5676480	5682000	But yeah, it's very likely me growing up in a fundamental christian church where I heard messages really early
5682080	5685840	That if you lust after a woman's breast you go to all you go to hell for all eternity
5686240	5689440	You know where you know, my mom taught me to be not be like my dad
5689920	5694080	Where you know, I listen to the women that he's a jerk. He only wants one thing, you know
5694640	5699440	Yeah, there might have been some scarring that went into the you know, I'm trying to work out
5699760	5704560	You know, it's better to not have a sex drive. Oh my penis betrayed me again by getting a wreck
5705200	5711600	You know what stop doing that. You know, you know, I'm trying to work out from a first sexual experience
5712960	5717280	My first the first time I had sex the girl who I worked with at the
5718240	5719760	local
5719760	5721760	Hotel where I was the room service boy
5722960	5724160	Do you know what?
5724160	5725280	uh
5725280	5726480	fucking
5726480	5728480	What was it?
5728720	5736160	A vw loopo is a loopo loopo. It's like the site. It's smaller than a fee at 500 and it was three door
5736720	5738720	and it was in a
5739520	5743760	Uh, like an industrial estate halfway between did you have sex in the loopo?
5744160	5745600	I had I
5745600	5749360	If you think that having sex for the first time is difficult having sex for the first time in a car
5749440	5754560	That's like half the size of a jumper just turns the turns the difficulty level up to 11
5754960	5759760	um, but yeah, I maybe maybe that's I don't know what that means. We were next to a
5760400	5766720	Like a Mercedes bends mechanics. Maybe that's why I love f1 so much. I'm not sure I keep getting an erection whenever I see Lewis Hamilton
5766720	5767760	I'm not sure
5767760	5773280	Uh, we could really spend my my first attempt was in a chevy vega
5773920	5780400	You know, it probably slightly bigger slightly bigger the next time I tried it. It was on a park school bus. I got smart, right?
5780800	5782800	Yeah, very nice
5782800	5786000	Very good. Well, I mean the school bus. Yeah, but um, yeah, it's
5786640	5790880	It's it's very interesting to think about how we sort of internalize these stories
5791440	5797440	And I had a do you know dr. Paul conty is so that was stanford. I've heard that name
5797840	5800000	I couldn't tell you who he is but I have heard the name
5800400	5807200	So he did a four-part series with andrew huberman last year. I've heard that name too. Yes. Yeah, so every everybody says that name all the time
5807440	5811120	He's fantastic. They're both fantastic and um, paul does uh
5811840	5813440	evidence-based
5813440	5815440	unconscious work trauma
5816080	5817520	and such
5817520	5820320	from a very medical standpoint and um
5821440	5825280	He was talking to me. He gave me this really lovely frame very interesting about how
5826240	5828640	Formative experiences in our past
5829360	5836160	Can reshape the way that we see the entirety of that world but importantly they reshape our
5836720	5839360	Memory of what it was like before that as well
5839840	5844480	so for us to say something like uh, I get in a car accident when I'm 25 and
5844880	5851360	Then you get travel anxiety which causes you to not enjoy driving or to feel anxious when you're driving and then at 35 you tell yourself
5851680	5852960	I've never
5852960	5857440	liked driving you were like no until the age of 25 you loved it. Do you not remember you did that thing?
5857440	5858160	It's like no no no
5858160	5860160	I was anxious the whole time and this
5860560	5867520	this ability that like the fallibility and the malleability of our memory and our sense of self and our understanding of ourselves
5868000	5871680	um the fact that for sufficiently formative experiences
5872560	5873680	can
5873680	5878160	Like manipulate those and mold them in a different way. I just thought was so
5878880	5881360	It's fascinating but kind of brutal as well
5881760	5885760	Well, and maybe this is a the same another way of explaining the same thing
5886480	5891040	Every time we recall a memory we fundamentally change the memory
5891920	5897040	Because every time we recall it we're now in a different emotional state a different position different surroundings
5897760	5898720	We
5898720	5900720	Accurate memory does not exist
5900720	5905280	Right, you know what even even as we think we're remembering our earliest sexual experience
5905680	5908080	You know if there was actually a camera they're filming it
5908080	5910560	We might find out it's completely totally different
5910880	5914400	Surrounding wise than we thought so every time we recall a memory
5914800	5920080	We're altering it. So our memories keep changing over a lifetime. So um
5920880	5922400	but what but
5922400	5926560	What happens at that trauma we're talking about and that what I call the cross wiring
5927040	5934320	That's happening at an emotional level and so it doesn't matter even if our memory is accurate in terms of you know, digitally
5934720	5937760	Accurate what what matters is emotionally
5938720	5942000	How we move forward with it and so now if you know
5942000	5948160	We've been a sexual creature since birth and all of a sudden something happens that sex is hidden
5948640	5953600	Well, I better keep it hidden from from here on out and we don't make that as a conscious decision
5954000	5957440	It's just an emotional roadmap that we start following
5958160	5959760	Hmm
5959760	5967760	It's very very interesting. Okay. So we identified this and people are sitting listening to you and I talking very openly about sexual experiences
5967760	5969920	And they're going you're not supposed to do that
5969920	5976960	You're not supposed to talk openly about those things because they're going on their emotional wiring of how you're supposed to you know
5977200	5981280	Be about sex. Yeah. Well like the vw lupo opens all sorts of doors
5981520	5986240	Um three of them exactly egg precisely correct unless you can clamber out the back honestly, dude
5986240	5990640	I I and I remember how not far the passenger seat went back as well
5990640	5994400	I just thought this is what and you got to do in the passenger seat because of the steering wheel
5994480	5996800	But you guys have the steering wheel on the wrong side of the car
5997360	6003840	Well, speak for yourself. Look, we've gone through this litany of problems, right? This big big big big list and
6004800	6006800	We don't have enough time to
6006800	6010240	prescribe the panacea for all of the nice guys listening
6010880	6012720	given the fact that you've done
6012720	6014560	so many
6014560	6017360	seminars coaching sessions working with people
6018000	6021680	What have you found if you were to give the biggest movers?
6022640	6023920	of
6023920	6025920	Rehabilitation for nice guys
6026720	6029040	I don't think i've ever used that exact word for it
6029760	6031840	What what what are the uh the practices?
6031840	6037600	What are the places that they should focus on in order to start to embody themselves more honestly?
6038080	6040320	Okay, yeah be their authentic selves exactly
6040800	6044880	I'll just walk you through what I did number one. I tell people find safe people
6045440	6049280	Don't try to do this on your own. You didn't become a nice guy in social isolation
6050080	6053040	Don't try to get over it in social isolation
6053360	6059520	We have to have safe people to start releasing our shame to tell people I've got this story about myself and people go
6060160	6064400	That's not bad. That's not terrible at all. You're know, that's normal what you're describing
6064560	6069520	So we need safe people to support us release our shame perhaps mentor us
6070000	6076960	Encourage us help us face our fears. So I tell nice guys go find a coach therapist men's group. I love men's groups
6077360	6078640	do
6078640	6080640	A big chunk of my own personal
6080720	6087600	Rehabilitation in in men's groups. Uh, I was leading five men's groups a week when I was in private practice up in seattle
6088080	6092560	Um, I just I'm a believer so find men's group. Don't try to do this alone
6092800	6096640	How do you suggest to interject there? How do you know if it's a good men's group or a bad men's group?
6097520	6104400	That that's a good question and it is somewhat subjective because something a group you love might not work for me
6107600	6113680	When I started looking for something about all that existed at that time was the uh,
6113760	6118720	The robert blei methyl poetic go out in the woods beat a drum have the talking stick and say, oh
6119040	6125280	I did that I ended up in a 12-step program is where I started it not wasn't by choice. It just where I landed
6125920	6130800	Um, I got I got lucky. I landed and I was in a men's group led by a woman
6131040	6135520	Around sexual shame who liked men and so that was good for me
6136000	6140960	I tried some other men's groups that I just never connected or resonated with
6142400	6147200	A core piece I would recommend whether you're looking for a coach a therapist a men's group
6147360	6151680	Is find somebody who leads it who's actually done their own work
6151920	6157440	You mentioned embodiment quite a bit somebody who's actually gone out worked on their own stuff
6157760	6164240	You know, I I became a therapist. I got my phd in marriage and family therapy at 29 years old
6165200	6169680	Started you know a few years later started doing, you know trying to do real therapy
6170320	6172320	I'd never been to therapy
6172320	6179200	And you know, it wasn't till I got into therapy and men's groups and started working on my own
6179840	6184480	Toxic shame and my own anxieties and my own patterns that I could actually really help people
6185040	6189760	So, you know, um, it doesn't hurt to check out, you know, ask the person
6190720	6191760	What's your journey?
6191760	6195680	You know, we're we're if you worked on yourself and then just see do you connect with them?
6196160	6197920	Let's usually go place do you connect?
6198000	6205760	So go go find a coach therapist men's group 12 step group something where you get to go start revealing you releasing toxic shame
6206480	6210880	Start being honest nice guys think they're honest or anything but honest
6211280	6213600	I remember pretty early in my process
6214160	6218880	I realized almost everything I told my then wife was whatever won't rock the boat
6219440	6222960	So I I told her I'm gonna work and be an honest whenever I catch myself
6223680	6226560	Making up a story to tell you I'm gonna come tell you
6226880	6230880	I was gonna lie to you. Here's the lie. I was gonna tell you. Here's the whole truth
6231840	6236960	So I started doing that and actually I used to tell her her middle name ought to be overreact because that's
6237360	6242560	What she did and every the funny thing was what actually just started telling her the truth about shit. She'd go, okay
6243200	6247280	Thanks for telling me that I'm glad you didn't lie to me and you know, whoa, that's different
6247440	6252000	You know when I was trying to get her not to overreact she did when I just told her the truth
6252400	6258640	Yeah, okay, don't lie to me. That was it. So work on being honest and again, we need safe people usually to do that
6259680	6262000	Work on making your needs a priority
6262480	6268000	Sorry to ask yourself. What do I want? What's important to me? You know, am I do I do I need to go to the gym?
6268080	6271600	Do I need to go to the dentist? Do I need to take some time to relax?
6272160	6274640	Do I need to rest my eyes? Do I need to go read a good book?
6274720	6278080	Do I you know, how do I get my needs met and how do I let people
6278480	6283520	Help me get my needs met and how do I surround myself with people who want to help me get my needs met?
6284960	6286960	Uh start working on boundaries
6287360	6293200	That's that's a big one for nice guys is well, nobody grows into adulthood knowing how to set boundaries because
6294080	6296400	Nobody teaches children how to set boundaries
6296800	6297360	um
6297360	6303360	Because in in the real world the big people get to do whatever they want to the little people and because we were all little people
6303440	6307520	We never learned you could say no stop that i'm going to remove myself now
6308240	6311200	So learn about boundaries. I was in my thirties
6312080	6314580	In my second marriage with a phd
6315040	6318880	Before I had ever even heard of boundaries a therapist. I went to taught me about them
6319520	6325360	So start working on boundaries and then I just I think the one other piece i'll throw out there that I think is just so fundamental
6325680	6327680	Especially for guys for nice guys
6328000	6328880	go
6328880	6330160	connect with men
6330160	6331040	Go
6331040	6337600	Build a tribe of men. I've had to do that a few times in my life about seven years ago when I got married down here in
6337600	6339360	Mexico
6339360	6343200	Not yet fluent Spanish my wife only speaks Spanish
6343680	6345920	And i'm living in here working at home
6346720	6348720	I I had no guys in my life
6348880	6353200	And I went seeking and found a men's program and joined it and now
6354720	6361520	If you looked at my text messaging my calendars my email i'm on zoom i'm messaging with buddies
6362080	6364480	all the friggin time and it just
6365120	6370160	It makes everything about my world better. I'm I'm more on point with with my work
6370800	6374880	My relationship improved. I'm in better health. I'm happier
6375440	6380400	So build a connection with men. So there's about five things that are a pretty good start
6381920	6384240	Dr. Robert Glover ladies and gentlemen, Robert I
6385040	6390560	Adore your work. I think it's very much needed. It's so fascinating that it's been around for quite a while
6391040	6395440	You know and and yet this single thread of guys being overly pliable
6395680	6399760	Of resenting despite the fact that they're playing the game correctly. They think that they're doing all the rest of it
6400880	6402400	is uh
6402400	6408240	It's so fascinating and I I've today's been phenomenal. Where should people go? They want to keep up to date with your work
6408480	6409440	You've got
