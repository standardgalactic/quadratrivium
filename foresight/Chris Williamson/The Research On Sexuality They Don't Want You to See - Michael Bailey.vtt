00:00.000 --> 00:02.440
What happened with your recent article?

00:03.160 --> 00:07.680
So the short answer is that our recent article has been

00:08.480 --> 00:11.840
retracted by the publisher of the journal

00:12.720 --> 00:15.120
Archives of Sexual Behavior where it was published

00:18.040 --> 00:24.040
Retraction is something I've never had an article retracted before and it's something that I've associated with

00:25.000 --> 00:26.200
terrible

00:26.200 --> 00:28.200
things like

00:28.480 --> 00:30.200
fraud

00:30.200 --> 00:32.200
plagiarism

00:32.840 --> 00:34.840
Grievous mistakes

00:34.960 --> 00:38.400
None of that is true about our article

00:41.560 --> 00:43.960
Frankly and honestly our article was

00:45.200 --> 00:52.000
retracted because of the ideas and the evidence it presented that angered

00:53.000 --> 00:58.400
Transgender activists and their allies who pressured the publisher who

01:00.200 --> 01:02.200
Either agreed with them

01:03.640 --> 01:05.640
based on politics or

01:06.640 --> 01:12.120
Chickened out or were worried about business concerns. I can't read their mind obviously

01:12.840 --> 01:15.760
But I will say that the retraction was a sham

01:17.280 --> 01:19.280
I would also say that

01:20.280 --> 01:22.280
The retraction has

01:23.920 --> 01:26.320
Backfired entirely from their perspective

01:27.280 --> 01:32.080
Our article has gotten far more attention than it ever would have

01:33.160 --> 01:36.360
the publisher springer nature group

01:37.200 --> 01:39.280
Keeps metrics on this

01:40.000 --> 01:45.600
Our article has been downloaded almost 100,000 times, which is

01:46.360 --> 01:50.160
You know, that's not perhaps a big deal for

01:51.520 --> 01:54.800
Mainstream media, but for an academic article that is extreme

01:56.000 --> 01:59.280
We have received more news coverage

02:00.040 --> 02:02.040
we're about

02:02.640 --> 02:03.720
40

02:03.720 --> 02:09.480
Ranked 40 out of 400,000 articles of about the same age in terms of media coverage

02:10.960 --> 02:14.680
Here we are talking, you know, I'm on a big podcast with you

02:15.840 --> 02:23.840
And there have been articles and so on so I'm not hurting. I just want people to

02:25.160 --> 02:28.520
download and read our article and

02:30.840 --> 02:37.340
Don't pay attention to the retraction notice it it's meaningless if people want to get ahold of the now

02:38.520 --> 02:43.400
Forbidden article, where are that? Where should they go? Same place? They ever did

02:43.920 --> 02:48.920
Our article was published open access. That means we actually had

02:50.120 --> 02:52.000
funding from

02:52.000 --> 02:55.140
Society for evidence evidence-based gender medicine

02:56.360 --> 02:58.360
Segem to

03:00.480 --> 03:02.480
Published the article for

03:03.280 --> 03:09.560
Free reading, you know most articles academic articles have a paywall that non academics

03:09.920 --> 03:12.760
Can't get through easily. There's no paywall

03:13.800 --> 03:16.400
The retraction simply means

03:17.960 --> 03:22.320
For practical purposes that Springer stamped the words

03:23.160 --> 03:25.660
retracted article on every single page of

03:26.200 --> 03:27.840
the article

03:27.840 --> 03:31.720
Which you could it doesn't affect your ability to read it and frankly I

03:33.200 --> 03:38.240
Wear those words as a badge of honor now

03:38.880 --> 03:43.920
That makes it kind of sexy it makes it it feels like it's a top-secret seal

03:43.920 --> 03:46.360
So what's there's someone that's listening that wants to go and search?

03:46.360 --> 03:49.920
What's what should they search for on the internet in order to get this article up in the right form?

03:51.840 --> 03:53.840
So

03:54.200 --> 04:00.920
What I search in order to go to the site to keep track on our current metrics

04:01.240 --> 04:06.980
You know, I'm really waiting for when we get a hundred thousand dollar view. I'm sorry one hundred thousand views

04:07.980 --> 04:09.980
Diaz DIA Z

04:10.820 --> 04:12.820
Bailey B. A. I. L. E. Y.

04:14.060 --> 04:21.100
Our O. G. D. for rapid onset gender dysphoria, which is what it's about and then you'll have

04:22.060 --> 04:27.380
Links to choose from choose the one that says Springer and that'll take you right to the site

04:27.380 --> 04:32.200
You can read the article right there. Okay, so we've flirted with it so far

04:32.720 --> 04:39.040
What was in your forbidden study, which was so reprehensible that caused it to be

04:40.080 --> 04:42.160
retracted and

04:42.160 --> 04:44.160
stamped with a wax seal I

04:45.640 --> 04:46.960
I'll

04:46.960 --> 04:51.320
Tell you in a moment, but I just want to give a bit of background

04:52.520 --> 04:54.520
this article was

04:55.480 --> 04:57.480
published by me and

04:57.640 --> 04:59.640
a co-author

04:59.840 --> 05:04.680
Susanna Diaz that is not her real name. I don't know her real name

05:06.040 --> 05:08.040
She is the mother of

05:08.680 --> 05:14.720
A gender dysphoric child whom she believes has rapid onset gender dysphoria

05:15.120 --> 05:21.880
Which is rapid onset gender dysphoria something we need to talk about I assume that your audience

05:22.640 --> 05:27.440
Doesn't necessarily know what it is. It's very important and it is the reason

05:27.440 --> 05:29.440
Why

05:30.040 --> 05:32.560
The trans activists came after us

05:34.400 --> 05:36.400
Rapid onset gender dysphoria is

05:37.160 --> 05:39.160
the explanation of

05:39.440 --> 05:41.440
the surge in

05:43.640 --> 05:49.400
Cases of gender dysphoria that has happened over the past decade and especially the past five years

05:50.920 --> 05:52.920
The idea is this a

05:54.480 --> 05:56.480
subset of

05:56.520 --> 06:02.520
Gender dysphoric cases and now it's by far the greatest percentage are

06:04.760 --> 06:06.760
Adolescent girls

06:07.680 --> 06:14.600
Who never showed any signs of gender dysphoria in childhood? They were not tomboy's they were not

06:15.840 --> 06:17.600
masculine

06:17.600 --> 06:20.560
They did however have issues a

06:21.240 --> 06:23.240
lot of them had some

06:23.520 --> 06:27.520
Mental health problems. They had some social problems and so on

06:30.240 --> 06:32.240
In adolescence

06:33.160 --> 06:36.400
They tended to hang out with a crowd that

06:37.400 --> 06:41.480
was unconventional and progressive and ideological and

06:42.840 --> 06:44.160
they

06:44.160 --> 06:46.160
got the idea

06:46.200 --> 06:47.640
Based on

06:47.640 --> 06:54.120
Theology that all of their problems are due to underlying transgender that they never knew of before

06:55.680 --> 06:58.480
They suddenly or rapidly

06:59.280 --> 07:05.440
announced or they decided that they're transgender and they announced to their parents and

07:06.520 --> 07:13.120
Many of these girls. It's mainly girls about three quarters. There may be some boys, too

07:13.120 --> 07:15.480
But we should talk about them separately a

07:16.120 --> 07:21.320
Lot of them are demanding very serious

07:23.400 --> 07:25.920
Treatments including medical treatments

07:27.280 --> 07:29.080
They want

07:29.080 --> 07:30.960
testosterone

07:30.960 --> 07:32.400
which

07:32.400 --> 07:34.400
has very serious

07:35.720 --> 07:41.960
Effects on the body and some of them want surgery like the amputation of their breasts

07:42.680 --> 07:45.480
And some of them are getting this

07:47.720 --> 07:50.560
Our evidence in our article is

07:52.240 --> 07:54.240
Entirely consistent with that

07:54.600 --> 07:56.600
We surveyed

07:58.280 --> 07:59.880
1655

07:59.880 --> 08:01.400
parents of

08:01.400 --> 08:04.960
Youth whom the parents believed had this syndrome

08:06.440 --> 08:10.040
Three-quarters were of the youth were girls

08:12.000 --> 08:14.440
The parents said that indeed these

08:15.720 --> 08:17.720
youth had

08:18.160 --> 08:20.160
pre-existing

08:20.200 --> 08:25.840
Mental health issues and that the mental health issues actually preceded any

08:26.760 --> 08:31.200
indication of gender issues by four years. That's a long time

08:33.640 --> 08:35.640
The

08:36.640 --> 08:43.800
Youth who were most likely to socially transition now social transition means

08:45.480 --> 08:49.160
Changing their pronouns changing their style of dress changing

08:50.280 --> 08:52.280
What they call themselves boy or girl

08:53.640 --> 08:58.280
The youth most likely to socially transition were the ones with the most problems

09:00.240 --> 09:04.560
That was also true for medical transition which was

09:05.760 --> 09:08.560
Thankfully rare only about seven percent

09:09.800 --> 09:15.800
Had sought medical or had obtained medical treatment whereas about sixty percent had

09:16.360 --> 09:21.200
Taken many steps to social transition parents said after they

09:22.360 --> 09:24.360
Socially transitioned they got worse

09:25.080 --> 09:26.280
and

09:26.280 --> 09:28.280
The best is what does worse mean?

09:29.160 --> 09:31.160
they

09:32.160 --> 09:35.800
Became less happy they became less

09:37.160 --> 09:39.160
Close to their parents

09:39.640 --> 09:41.640
They decompensated and

09:42.760 --> 09:44.760
the best predictor of

09:45.400 --> 09:47.400
Transition was

09:51.120 --> 09:55.440
That the family had received a referral to a gender specialist and

09:56.440 --> 10:05.800
And if parents visited a gender specialist they usually felt that the gender specialist pressured them to transition their child

10:07.440 --> 10:13.240
So there were some other interesting findings too, but those were the ones that got

10:15.080 --> 10:17.640
People upset and I think those are probably the most

10:18.280 --> 10:23.160
Important findings because they are consistent with the idea of rapid onset gender dysphoria

10:24.160 --> 10:30.140
Rapid onset gender dysphoria was first proposed by Lisa Littman who published the first paper in 2018

10:30.520 --> 10:32.520
She also received

10:32.840 --> 10:34.840
tremendous pushback

10:34.840 --> 10:40.160
Her the journal where she published her article did not retract it, but they did

10:41.160 --> 10:47.280
make her make changes to her original article and she suffered personal

10:47.800 --> 10:50.240
Consequences Brown University where she was

10:51.080 --> 10:53.080
Cut off their ties with her

10:53.840 --> 10:55.840
She you know she lost

10:56.520 --> 10:58.520
contracts with Brown University

11:04.480 --> 11:12.000
Activists cannot stand the idea of rapid onset gender dysphoria and I understand why

11:13.520 --> 11:18.280
Because it is threatening to their belief system

11:19.000 --> 11:21.480
They're strong. They strongly believe that

11:23.000 --> 11:25.160
Gender dysphoria is always real and

11:26.600 --> 11:28.600
that the best

11:28.960 --> 11:30.960
Way to proceed is

11:31.480 --> 11:36.560
To transition as quickly as possible and furthermore that youth are

11:37.400 --> 11:39.440
Always right when they say

11:40.240 --> 11:42.800
That they are gender dysphoric

11:43.560 --> 11:49.480
That they're trans just believe them all of these are contradicted by the idea of

11:50.440 --> 11:52.440
rapid onset gender dysphoria and

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Our study was strongly

11:55.240 --> 11:57.240
consistent

11:57.240 --> 11:59.240
with

11:59.840 --> 12:03.360
The existence of rapid onset gender dysphoria I

12:04.040 --> 12:06.040
will admit

12:06.200 --> 12:08.680
That ours is only the second

12:09.560 --> 12:17.120
Major study of this phenomenon and there's plenty of work to do and I don't think that we've got this

12:17.440 --> 12:19.640
Nailed shut so that everybody is

12:20.440 --> 12:24.000
Obligated to see this world as we do

12:24.640 --> 12:26.800
but it's an important study and

12:28.600 --> 12:33.840
Instead of trying to silence our search it would been better

12:34.680 --> 12:35.720
if

12:35.720 --> 12:38.160
The skeptical had done their own studies

12:38.960 --> 12:43.400
To try to clarify what they thought was going on but of course

12:45.040 --> 12:47.040
They didn't want to do that

12:48.960 --> 12:53.760
See if I'm right with my conception of this sort of two current

12:54.280 --> 13:00.600
Explanations for what's going on with regards to the increase that we've seen over the last ten years or so

13:01.280 --> 13:03.400
one theory posits that

13:03.640 --> 13:05.640
The world's

13:06.360 --> 13:10.800
Degree of acceptance of trans people at large has changed

13:11.040 --> 13:14.800
It's called the left-handedness argument online sometimes

13:14.840 --> 13:20.800
Which is that during the Middle Ages if you were left-handed you were often accused of being a witch or a wizard or something

13:20.960 --> 13:26.200
And it would cause you to be ostracized or sometimes killed or punished socially in some form or another

13:26.360 --> 13:31.800
Which meant that I think maybe only three percent of people were left-handed during the Middle Ages

13:32.120 --> 13:36.120
But then when left-handedness is no longer seen as wicked and it's socially accepted

13:36.120 --> 13:42.320
I think the true number of left-handed people is closer to maybe 12% let's say so you see an increase in the number of people who

13:43.760 --> 13:46.720
Identify as left-handed I suppose they can be their true

13:46.720 --> 13:52.800
So they're true left-handed selves because there is no longer social stigma attached to it. There is a camp that

13:53.600 --> 13:55.600
argues that the

13:55.800 --> 14:03.040
Rapid increase that we have seen in the number of people identifying as transgender over the last decades to two decades or so

14:03.160 --> 14:05.160
Has been due to this

14:05.680 --> 14:09.520
Releasing of the glass ceiling and and judgment by the group at large

14:09.960 --> 14:13.520
The alternative theory which is being put forward is one of social contagion

14:14.160 --> 14:16.160
That explains why

14:16.760 --> 14:22.240
Females in particular the F to M transition are particularly susceptible to this

14:22.960 --> 14:24.960
females are more

14:25.960 --> 14:32.840
Socially aware socially malleable and influenced. It's part of their sort of intersexual competition and status

14:33.960 --> 14:35.360
measuring

14:35.360 --> 14:37.360
Apparatus that they have a greater

14:38.320 --> 14:41.160
susceptibility to trends around them because they are

14:41.520 --> 14:44.800
It's important for them to remain part of the tribe in that regard

14:44.800 --> 14:51.240
Which would explain or be part of the explanation for why girls seem to be more impacted by this

14:52.240 --> 14:57.360
Ever-increasing number. It's almost like a mimetic sort of feedback loop that's occurring

14:57.880 --> 15:02.000
How far away am I and what have I missed in terms of that conception of the landscape?

15:02.680 --> 15:05.240
You put it beautifully better than I did

15:06.000 --> 15:10.240
So you should have got me on the paper. I could have been cancelled as well. Yes. Yes

15:10.880 --> 15:14.400
You're considered yourself a co-author on future research

15:14.840 --> 15:20.000
Well, I actually I can take it. I get enough stick on the internet as it is already. Okay, so

15:21.240 --> 15:23.240
What is

15:25.560 --> 15:27.320
First question is it

15:27.320 --> 15:34.760
Impossible for these two worlds to exist together. Is there a blending of rapid-onset gender dysphoria with the

15:35.640 --> 15:40.880
Activists theory about about this. Is there a way that those two worlds could coexist? It's certainly and

15:42.400 --> 15:47.560
I suspect they do it's it's a question of which is predominating

15:48.560 --> 15:51.240
Obviously we become

15:52.760 --> 15:57.280
Much more tolerant of the transgender fairly recently I

15:58.200 --> 16:02.600
Wrote a book in 2003 and people back then thought that

16:03.520 --> 16:08.840
Transsexuals were really weird interesting but weird and people were uncomfortable around them

16:09.360 --> 16:13.280
now I think if anything they're thought to be

16:14.000 --> 16:15.520
cool

16:15.520 --> 16:17.520
and

16:18.560 --> 16:20.560
I'm glad that

16:21.600 --> 16:25.280
Tolerance has increased for the transgender

16:26.920 --> 16:30.320
But I also think that it's important to realize

16:32.320 --> 16:33.680
That

16:33.680 --> 16:35.680
There may be trade-offs I

16:36.760 --> 16:42.920
Don't think we need to be intolerant, but I do think that we need to be aware that

16:44.520 --> 16:47.200
Attitudes affect what people choose to do

16:48.520 --> 16:50.520
Being transgender is

16:51.840 --> 16:54.400
Partly a decision that a person makes

16:57.480 --> 17:02.400
Take a very for example a very masculine female

17:03.520 --> 17:08.160
Well, she might decide well, you know, I'm not just a masculine

17:09.600 --> 17:14.520
Teenage girl. I like playing baseball. You know, I'll just be a girl

17:15.520 --> 17:19.760
But or she may say well gosh, you know, I

17:22.080 --> 17:24.080
Could imagine being a boy plus

17:25.920 --> 17:31.280
You know, I get a lot of cred if I am transsexual and

17:33.880 --> 17:42.000
Also really something we haven't mentioned yet which is happening which I think is negative is the binding up of

17:44.720 --> 17:47.240
transgender identity and victim status and

17:48.320 --> 17:50.320
I just think that

17:51.280 --> 17:53.280
That's a problem with our

17:53.800 --> 17:58.640
World right now that we're promoting victim status not just among the transgender

17:58.640 --> 18:01.880
But all kinds of phenomena and I just think it's very negative

18:02.800 --> 18:10.640
It creates a perverse incentive for people to pedestalize things which are actually negative in the long term

18:11.200 --> 18:18.320
Yes, self-harm, you know, if self-harm gives you a degree of prestige somehow in whatever

18:18.680 --> 18:20.680
upside down vastal world it is

18:21.080 --> 18:26.040
There is now an incentive for people to do a thing which there should be a disincentive for them to do

18:27.400 --> 18:33.920
So you there is social renown now for self-harm or for

18:34.800 --> 18:37.280
MP a

18:37.280 --> 18:41.720
Multiple personality disorder. I don't know whether you saw on tiktok last year. There was a trend of people

18:42.200 --> 18:44.800
They would have that others. I can't remember what the word was

18:44.800 --> 18:49.720
It's like that other the other versions of them would would come out and I'm a this person and I'm at that person

18:50.200 --> 18:52.200
Which again, you know

18:52.360 --> 18:57.880
I'm pretty sure who was the guy that created eugenics who was the dude that did it in the 1900s

18:58.080 --> 19:00.080
Francis Galton Francis Galton

19:00.600 --> 19:05.160
Managed to make himself go insane by worshiping a doll as a deity

19:05.600 --> 19:06.640
right

19:06.640 --> 19:13.880
My point being that you can you can induce all manner of crazy psychological maladies if you believe them hard enough

19:14.520 --> 19:16.520
that so I don't want to

19:17.560 --> 19:22.800
Way in on Galton because I don't know what you're just talking about and I do know a fair about

19:23.960 --> 19:25.880
Fair amount about Galton

19:25.880 --> 19:32.200
But what the other thing that you said the key thing is absolutely true and really important and really fascinating that

19:33.560 --> 19:35.560
If people believe

19:36.360 --> 19:38.320
They can

19:38.320 --> 19:43.720
Enact all kinds of things and when I say enact I don't mean they're pretending exactly

19:44.400 --> 19:46.400
They're acting as if

19:47.960 --> 19:50.360
They're acting in accordance with their beliefs

19:50.920 --> 19:54.320
This is not the first go-around were for multiple personality disorder

19:54.320 --> 19:56.320
We had an epidemic in the

19:57.160 --> 20:00.360
early 1990s that was associated with an

20:01.640 --> 20:05.400
Epidemic of recovered memories of sexual abuse. This was

20:06.600 --> 20:13.000
young women typically who went to therapy with a therapist who believed in this

20:13.800 --> 20:15.800
who persuaded these

20:16.880 --> 20:19.240
Women that their fathers typically

20:19.920 --> 20:27.920
Had sexual severely sexually abused them repeatedly over years despite these women never having any

20:30.120 --> 20:32.560
Memory of this and of course these memories

20:33.960 --> 20:35.960
These recovered memories were false

20:36.560 --> 20:38.440
They didn't happen

20:38.440 --> 20:40.440
and a subset of these women

20:41.240 --> 20:44.600
also came to believe that they were more personality disorder and

20:45.480 --> 20:50.720
I think that this what's happening now with ROGD rapid onset gender dysphoria is

20:52.400 --> 20:59.320
The same thing and the women that the the big difference is that the girls this is happening to

21:00.120 --> 21:06.520
Are getting it younger 14 15 16 instead of 24 25 26 and

21:07.280 --> 21:12.000
They're getting it from their peers rather than a therapist. Otherwise I suspect

21:12.640 --> 21:14.120
the same

21:14.160 --> 21:16.960
kinds of people are involved at both

21:17.960 --> 21:20.460
epidemics both times why

21:22.760 --> 21:25.240
Why would it be the case that there are

21:27.120 --> 21:29.120
Psychological risk factors like

21:30.160 --> 21:31.360
OCD

21:31.360 --> 21:36.640
autism spectrum disorder and a few others. Why would they be predictive of

21:37.640 --> 21:39.640
ROGD?

21:40.400 --> 21:44.600
Autism gets thrown around a lot as very common. I

21:46.480 --> 21:51.280
Am not as impressed as many people are by the evidence for autism

21:52.440 --> 21:54.440
for one

21:54.880 --> 21:56.880
Diagnosis of autism

21:57.640 --> 22:05.120
Has become so vague. I don't even know what it means anymore. It's become quite over diagnosed

22:06.000 --> 22:13.120
The youth in our study did have an excess of

22:14.120 --> 22:17.960
Formal diagnoses, but they were very general anxiety and depression

22:20.200 --> 22:22.200
Why would

22:23.280 --> 22:26.960
Women with these emotional problems have this susceptibility

22:28.240 --> 22:30.520
I'm not sure the

22:31.520 --> 22:34.680
1990s epidemic these were

22:35.760 --> 22:37.560
somewhat older

22:37.560 --> 22:39.400
individuals and so they had

22:39.400 --> 22:41.400
More time to get accurate

22:42.160 --> 22:46.320
Diagnoses and the number one associated diagnosis was borderline

22:47.080 --> 22:53.680
Personality disorder which is associated with identity disturbance not knowing exactly who you are

22:54.240 --> 22:57.240
What you want to be being manipulative being?

22:57.240 --> 23:01.720
Prone to extreme emotions

23:03.160 --> 23:08.760
Now do I have an explanation why it's they who

23:10.400 --> 23:17.520
Are most susceptible to these false ideas. I don't think I do I don't think I do I

23:19.080 --> 23:25.720
Had a conversation with David Geary a couple of months ago and David what do you fascinating guy?

23:26.240 --> 23:31.360
Absolutely fascinating phenomenal episode and one of the things that I learned when speaking to him

23:31.360 --> 23:35.640
He was the first person that introduced me to the concept of rapid onset gender dysphoria

23:36.400 --> 23:38.400
the group

23:38.400 --> 23:39.960
that

23:39.960 --> 23:41.040
the

23:41.040 --> 23:47.120
Another ideology that would be associated with some of the people who seem to be suffering rapid on debt gender

23:47.280 --> 23:52.320
Rapid onset gender dysphoria would be a denial of biological differences between men and women

23:53.320 --> 23:59.360
The fascinating thing that's oddly sort of recursive and cyclical and almost ironic if it wasn't so

24:00.160 --> 24:02.160
odd is that

24:02.320 --> 24:08.240
The very reason that we have a sexed difference in the number of F to M transitions is

24:08.760 --> 24:10.760
precisely because of

24:10.760 --> 24:16.400
The biological difference between men and women it is the biological difference between men and women that

24:16.760 --> 24:19.920
predisposes these very goals to the

24:20.560 --> 24:24.640
Increased susceptibility of transition and that's the same group that is denying it

24:24.640 --> 24:30.240
So it's both the supply and the demand and the denial that kind of all rolled up into one. Do you know what I mean?

24:30.600 --> 24:32.600
yeah, they have a very

24:33.000 --> 24:39.280
strange set of beliefs that are mutually contradictory for example, they they believe in the

24:39.800 --> 24:41.480
idea of

24:41.480 --> 24:48.240
innate gender identity that may be hidden and so on but if it's an innate gender identity then and

24:48.840 --> 24:52.960
That men usually have one and women usually have another

24:53.800 --> 24:56.120
That's got to be a biological difference

24:57.960 --> 24:59.960
Yeah, I I

25:02.040 --> 25:04.280
Think that their science is

25:05.680 --> 25:07.680
Not very

25:07.880 --> 25:11.960
Coherent scientific. I don't think that's gonna be a very

25:12.680 --> 25:15.920
Useful way to persuade them

25:16.600 --> 25:18.600
What are the

25:18.680 --> 25:24.280
Given you've had this relative landmark study, you know one of only two massive n-size of whatever it was

25:25.520 --> 25:27.520
1655 pears

25:29.000 --> 25:36.160
1655 parents okay reporting on each parent reporting on a child of theirs. Yeah, yeah

25:36.480 --> 25:37.680
Um

25:37.680 --> 25:43.180
What do you what are the implications of this moving forward? What have you thought about sort of next steps and such?

25:43.680 --> 25:49.640
Well, I don't know my next step. I'm a you know, I'm an academic. I'm a researcher. I'm not a

25:50.640 --> 25:52.560
clinician I

25:52.560 --> 25:54.720
Think that we need to get

25:55.920 --> 25:58.120
better and more detailed

25:59.720 --> 26:01.720
Evidence and I'm involved in

26:02.080 --> 26:05.720
What I think is going to be a really important

26:07.440 --> 26:12.760
Study that is about to launch this summer it's in collaboration with Lisa Lippman

26:12.840 --> 26:20.680
Who is the person who first studied rabbit on set gender dysphoria and Ken Zucker who is one of the world's leading?

26:21.160 --> 26:23.160
experts in gender dysphoria

26:24.120 --> 26:26.120
All three of us have

26:27.240 --> 26:29.560
Been canceled at least once

26:30.520 --> 26:32.760
Uh, so we're uh the

26:34.600 --> 26:36.600
Collaborate cancelled collaborate

26:37.960 --> 26:43.960
Collaboration, but uh, we also are experts who are unafraid to stay in here

26:45.080 --> 26:48.360
We're in this study. We're going to be recruiting both

26:50.120 --> 26:54.360
Gender dysphoric adolescents directly and their families

26:55.320 --> 27:00.600
And we have a very extensive survey about you know mental health and

27:01.720 --> 27:05.000
gender feelings about gender history of gender

27:05.880 --> 27:08.440
Steps taken toward transition and so on

27:09.720 --> 27:15.960
We hope to enroll thousands and we're going to follow these people up over five years at least

27:17.080 --> 27:20.200
To see how they turn out and to see how that affects happiness

27:21.000 --> 27:27.720
Are the ones who transition going to eventually be happier than the ones who didn't

27:28.760 --> 27:30.760
For example, that's that's a big question

27:32.280 --> 27:35.320
Fascinating. Yeah, fascinating. I suppose it's one of those things were

27:37.400 --> 27:38.920
Being able to

27:38.920 --> 27:43.000
Spin explanations without the scientific backing can be done at lightning speed

27:43.320 --> 27:47.480
But being able to test the hypotheses with science is actually a pretty arduous task

27:47.800 --> 27:54.040
So you are always going to be playing catch up behind whatever the wake is that's left in terms of people's bro signs

27:55.560 --> 27:57.560
That's exactly right

27:58.040 --> 28:02.200
We sometimes have been frustrated ourselves. The scientific process

28:03.800 --> 28:06.840
Is slow in part for bureaucratic reasons

28:07.400 --> 28:09.400
We have to be very careful

28:09.480 --> 28:14.040
To get ethics approval for this which by the way was the reason

28:14.280 --> 28:19.880
The ostensible reason not the true reason the ostensible reason why

28:21.000 --> 28:25.960
My latest article was retracted. What's the story there? What what what was the reason that they gave you?

28:27.480 --> 28:29.480
The reason was this

28:30.920 --> 28:33.240
Susanna Diaz is not an academic

28:35.560 --> 28:38.600
She just went ahead and put up a survey

28:39.480 --> 28:41.320
She's allowed to do that

28:41.400 --> 28:43.800
She's allowed to publish such a survey

28:44.920 --> 28:46.920
I am an academic

28:48.040 --> 28:50.040
I have constraints

28:50.360 --> 28:52.920
Any research that I do I have to get approved

28:53.480 --> 28:57.080
By something called an institutional review board IRB

28:58.280 --> 29:00.120
for ethics

29:00.120 --> 29:02.120
Now the data were already collected

29:04.280 --> 29:09.640
It's too late to go through IRB I checked with my IRB and they said well

29:11.400 --> 29:13.240
She didn't have to

29:13.240 --> 29:14.280
and

29:14.280 --> 29:16.280
You seem to be okay

29:16.520 --> 29:18.520
Being a co-author on this

29:19.480 --> 29:24.360
But Susanna have not done this very legalistic thing

29:26.600 --> 29:29.320
That was a conventional

29:30.840 --> 29:33.000
Informed consent which is basically

29:33.880 --> 29:35.880
This is exactly what you're going to be doing

29:36.440 --> 29:38.440
Do you consent?

29:38.840 --> 29:40.840
That is

29:41.640 --> 29:43.640
What springer

29:43.880 --> 29:49.080
Said was lacking. That's why they retracted the article. Here's why that's ridiculous

29:50.920 --> 29:56.440
She made it very clear to parents what the survey was about

30:00.120 --> 30:03.800
They agreed by actually completing the survey

30:04.520 --> 30:06.520
The last line of the survey said

30:07.240 --> 30:10.360
We're going to publish this online when we get enough data

30:10.920 --> 30:14.920
And that's something that springer also said she said you didn't tell them

30:15.720 --> 30:19.480
That their data were going to be published. Well, of course, they want this published

30:20.120 --> 30:22.120
they believe these parents

30:22.360 --> 30:24.360
are sick

30:24.360 --> 30:26.360
Of rogd being

30:27.800 --> 30:30.360
Shoved to the side being silenced

30:30.680 --> 30:34.680
That's part of the reason why they wanted to participate in the first place

30:36.440 --> 30:37.560
So

30:37.560 --> 30:39.560
That that's the reason they gave

30:40.280 --> 30:42.280
I don't believe it for a second

30:42.280 --> 30:48.840
But you know in our new research that we will be launching soon. We went through all the IRB

30:50.280 --> 30:52.440
Procedure we are so covered

30:53.560 --> 30:58.280
That uh, there's not going to be any chance of any problem like that

30:59.240 --> 31:05.000
Moving on to some of the other work that you've done. What is the typical sexual orientation of

31:05.880 --> 31:09.000
F to m and m to f people who identify as trans?

31:13.480 --> 31:15.880
Well, I want to start with

31:18.360 --> 31:20.360
What was typical

31:22.040 --> 31:24.520
20 years ago and

31:25.400 --> 31:26.520
And

31:26.520 --> 31:28.520
Before which which was

31:29.960 --> 31:31.960
Pretty well established

31:32.840 --> 31:37.960
Back then most f2m's that is natal females who wanted to become

31:39.320 --> 31:41.320
men first of all they were

31:43.080 --> 31:46.280
Adults before they were able to achieve that there was no

31:47.720 --> 31:52.120
transitioning of children or even adolescents

31:54.680 --> 31:57.720
Almost all of the female the males were female attracted

31:59.480 --> 32:02.360
Or in the vernacular of

32:03.560 --> 32:07.320
Sexology homosexual female the male transsexuals

32:08.280 --> 32:10.280
Uh, though about 10 percent

32:11.240 --> 32:13.320
Were, um, attracted to

32:15.080 --> 32:17.080
Men

32:18.440 --> 32:20.440
For male the female

32:20.600 --> 32:23.320
These are natal female. I'm sorry natal males

32:24.040 --> 32:26.040
Who want to become women?

32:26.200 --> 32:28.200
There were two types

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
The first type was

32:31.800 --> 32:37.480
The type perhaps we are most familiar with the kind that comes to mind immediately it would be a

32:38.360 --> 32:41.960
A male who was feminine from early childhood

32:42.600 --> 32:44.600
Little boy who wanted to be a girl

32:44.760 --> 32:47.080
Who became an adolescent who was

32:48.040 --> 32:53.800
Basically a girl and then uh when he could get surgery he did in adulthood

32:55.560 --> 32:58.440
That type uh was male attracted

32:59.640 --> 33:01.080
and

33:01.080 --> 33:05.240
Sexology called that a homosexual male the female transsexual

33:08.760 --> 33:15.800
Jazz ginnings, I don't know if you know who jazz ginnings is she's a reality tv show

33:17.160 --> 33:18.760
I

33:18.760 --> 33:21.880
Have considered her that type though. I'm less sure now for

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
uh various reasons, but

33:25.560 --> 33:27.160
the other type

33:27.160 --> 33:28.360
is

33:28.360 --> 33:32.360
At least as common, but it is quite unfamiliar because

33:33.960 --> 33:37.240
Nobody talks about it and it is autogynophilic

33:37.880 --> 33:39.880
male to female transsexualism

33:40.280 --> 33:42.920
Autogynophilia is a sexual

33:44.520 --> 33:46.520
Orientation I guess

33:47.320 --> 33:49.000
whereby

33:49.000 --> 33:53.640
A man is sexually aroused by the idea of being a woman

33:57.960 --> 33:59.960
Most of these

34:00.040 --> 34:06.440
Natal males are attracted to other people in the world and they're attracted to women

34:08.120 --> 34:10.120
But they are also

34:10.120 --> 34:17.560
Attracted to and sometimes much more attracted to a woman that they create inside themselves

34:19.640 --> 34:21.640
It starts

34:21.720 --> 34:24.040
typically in adolescence where they

34:25.240 --> 34:30.440
Will put on their mothers panties and bra look at themselves in the mirror and masturbate

34:32.040 --> 34:34.040
fetishistic cross-dressing

34:34.520 --> 34:39.000
Many of them will have fantasies about having breasts and a vulva

34:39.880 --> 34:44.920
And some of them will actually do what they need to to get those

34:48.120 --> 34:50.920
Autogynophilia is very controversial because

34:52.920 --> 34:54.920
Trans activists have tried to

34:57.880 --> 34:59.880
Sweep it under the rug

35:00.040 --> 35:04.920
They're embarrassed by it. I'm not I don't judge these people

35:04.920 --> 35:06.920
Also

35:08.680 --> 35:10.680
Many autogynophilic

35:11.640 --> 35:13.160
transgender

35:13.160 --> 35:15.160
persons

35:15.320 --> 35:17.320
It experience

35:17.320 --> 35:19.800
The theory as a narcissistic injury

35:20.440 --> 35:23.000
Because it really means a lot to them

35:23.880 --> 35:26.600
To think of themselves as like women

35:28.600 --> 35:31.560
The theory says they're not like women

35:32.520 --> 35:36.760
They're men with this weird sexuality

35:38.360 --> 35:40.360
And so that hurts their feelings

35:41.800 --> 35:46.120
So I published a book in 2003 called the man who would be queen

35:46.840 --> 35:48.680
and

35:48.680 --> 35:50.280
only

35:50.280 --> 35:51.960
about

35:51.960 --> 35:53.960
A third of the book

35:54.360 --> 35:55.960
was about

35:55.960 --> 35:57.800
adult transsexualism

35:57.800 --> 35:59.800
including autogynophilia

35:59.800 --> 36:02.360
And the trans activists back then

36:03.560 --> 36:07.560
A few of them got so mad at what I wrote that they tried to ruin my life

36:10.200 --> 36:12.200
Briefly, I thought they might

36:15.640 --> 36:18.840
But you know, they did back then what

36:20.760 --> 36:24.360
Is happening to our paper now they they caused a Streisand effect

36:25.400 --> 36:27.400
so

36:27.880 --> 36:32.200
More and more people have heard of autogynophilia including

36:38.760 --> 36:46.680
Persons with autogynophilia and I want to stress that many of the many autogynophilic males are great people

36:49.000 --> 36:52.440
In my experience if they are open and honest

36:53.160 --> 37:01.080
They're admirable. I have many autogynophilic followers on twitter

37:02.520 --> 37:05.880
I have some autogynophilic friends and so on

37:08.520 --> 37:11.880
And these people are angry

37:13.960 --> 37:18.920
Have the activists who have tried to censor any discussion of autogynophilia

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
It has

37:23.960 --> 37:26.200
Prevented us from knowing

37:27.800 --> 37:32.360
Things like the best way that autogynophilic individuals should live their lives

37:33.160 --> 37:36.280
Should they transition should they not transition?

37:39.480 --> 37:42.680
We don't know the study studies haven't been done because

37:44.280 --> 37:47.160
People haven't even felt free to ask the questions

37:48.120 --> 37:50.120
Is there a

37:50.520 --> 37:54.280
natal female equivalent? Have you ever come across anyone?

37:55.240 --> 37:58.120
That is the opposite of autogynophilia

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
This is controversial

38:04.120 --> 38:10.120
That should be that should be the preface for every single sentence that you say this is controversial

38:10.280 --> 38:15.400
I would say scientifically. I don't think anybody is politically upset about this at least yet

38:16.280 --> 38:21.320
Give it time. So the word for that would be autogynophilia

38:22.600 --> 38:24.040
and

38:24.040 --> 38:26.040
I know

38:28.360 --> 38:30.360
Trends gender

38:32.760 --> 38:38.520
Persons who insist that there really is autogynophilia

38:40.520 --> 38:43.720
There's a guy who named phil illy

38:44.680 --> 38:46.440
i l

38:46.440 --> 38:47.640
phil

38:47.640 --> 38:50.680
illy il y I think he's about to

38:51.800 --> 38:53.320
publish a book

38:53.320 --> 38:54.600
called

38:54.600 --> 38:56.600
auto heterosexuality

38:57.080 --> 38:59.080
very smart guy

38:59.160 --> 39:02.520
But he believes that autogynophilia

39:04.600 --> 39:08.760
Occurs commonly among transgender females

39:09.560 --> 39:12.600
I am less convinced. You know, I'm I'm being a hard-ass

39:13.560 --> 39:15.560
scientist, you know, I

39:16.520 --> 39:18.520
May be but I

39:18.600 --> 39:22.600
I kind of doubt it because male and female sexuality are so different

39:23.560 --> 39:28.040
Autogynophilia is something that requires a male type

39:30.440 --> 39:33.000
Sexuality which is very focused and fixed

39:34.120 --> 39:35.960
and strong

39:35.960 --> 39:37.960
and autogynophilia

39:38.440 --> 39:40.200
occurs

39:40.200 --> 39:42.200
kind of

39:42.200 --> 39:46.120
genetically a male finds out on his own and becomes

39:46.840 --> 39:48.840
Even though he's never heard of it before

39:49.640 --> 39:52.120
It dominates his early sex life

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
and I'm really

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
kind of skeptical that that happens

39:57.640 --> 39:59.640
In natal females, but we'll see

39:59.720 --> 40:01.160
we'll see does that

40:01.160 --> 40:03.480
if someone and if it's common

40:04.280 --> 40:07.880
That somebody that's never heard of it before kind of stumbles upon this thing

40:08.600 --> 40:10.360
this particular

40:10.360 --> 40:12.360
interest this orientation

40:12.680 --> 40:15.400
Does that suggest that there is a biological

40:16.280 --> 40:18.280
disposition precursor?

40:20.280 --> 40:22.280
I would bet

40:24.200 --> 40:27.160
More money than I have that we will

40:28.200 --> 40:34.360
Find that eventually. I think autogynophilia is strongly biological. Now. Can I prove that? No

40:35.800 --> 40:37.800
but

40:37.960 --> 40:39.960
What is going to make

40:41.160 --> 40:43.160
A 14 year old boy

40:43.160 --> 40:47.800
Decide to put on his mother's panties and go into the bathroom and look at himself and

40:48.360 --> 40:50.360
Become aroused and so on

40:50.920 --> 40:52.920
Nobody teaches him that

40:53.160 --> 40:57.160
You know, there's a lot of I should hope not. Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of interest now

40:57.960 --> 40:59.960
especially among

41:00.040 --> 41:02.040
gender critical types about

41:02.680 --> 41:05.400
something called sissy hypnoporn, which is

41:06.200 --> 41:10.360
It's a type of pornography consumed by

41:11.400 --> 41:14.440
Autogynophilic males and they're saying that

41:15.880 --> 41:20.360
This porn is creating autogynophilia. Well, I don't believe it. I feel like

41:21.160 --> 41:22.680
these guys

41:22.680 --> 41:29.080
Have this interest and they're finding the porn. I I don't think anything plausibly is going to

41:29.800 --> 41:31.800
To

41:32.120 --> 41:36.280
Raise this idea in somebody that doesn't already have the interest

41:38.360 --> 41:42.360
The other word that I learned when looking at some of your work is

41:43.320 --> 41:45.320
morphophilia

41:45.640 --> 41:49.480
One of the longest words I think I've ever said in my life. What's gynandromorphophilia?

41:51.320 --> 41:56.440
Gynandromorphophilia, so I'm gonna say a word that I I think is fine, but

41:56.440 --> 41:58.440
Um

41:58.760 --> 42:00.760
Some people are touchy about it

42:01.160 --> 42:05.160
Gynandromorphophilia is a sexual attraction to she males

42:06.120 --> 42:08.120
What I mean by a she male

42:08.360 --> 42:10.360
is a natal male

42:12.200 --> 42:17.400
Trans woman who has both breast and a penis still

42:19.160 --> 42:21.160
Um

42:21.640 --> 42:26.040
You know, I I can see it. I can see I can I can see it in my mind's eye. Yep. Well

42:27.320 --> 42:29.320
It's not hard to find it

42:29.720 --> 42:33.480
online that that is a kind of pornography. I have come across

42:34.840 --> 42:36.840
And it actually is

42:37.320 --> 42:39.320
quite a common form

42:39.720 --> 42:41.720
of pornography

42:41.880 --> 42:43.880
and even I think just

42:44.760 --> 42:46.920
Plano normal straight men

42:47.880 --> 42:49.880
Get into that sometimes

42:50.040 --> 42:53.080
But they're they're different than the kind of men

42:53.560 --> 42:57.560
Who need that and prefer it and for example, I had a

43:01.080 --> 43:05.480
I had a girlfriend at one time whose ex-husband

43:09.800 --> 43:14.200
Had that preference and in order for them to have sex

43:16.840 --> 43:22.600
They needed to bring a picture of a she male on the computer screen so he could look at it

43:23.720 --> 43:25.560
and become aroused

43:25.560 --> 43:27.560
That became a problem for her

43:27.560 --> 43:33.640
I can imagine I can imagine that that would create complications. Yes. Yeah, but that's you know, I some other

43:34.520 --> 43:36.520
Just plain old. I think

43:37.080 --> 43:39.080
mostly just plain old straight men

43:39.560 --> 43:41.720
They just I think don't have the hang up

43:42.360 --> 43:44.520
about the penis being there too

43:45.800 --> 43:52.440
This is what you know back in the 90s, you know on allen partridge, which is a famous british comedy show

43:53.080 --> 43:59.080
One of his friends it turns out was going to thailand and he comes back and all he wants to hear about is the ladyboys

43:59.400 --> 44:04.760
He all he wants to hear about is ladyboys. Tell me about the ladyboys. He keeps on saying. Yeah

44:06.040 --> 44:13.160
That's right. The ladyboys. That's that's what they are. Yeah, they still tour as ladyboys of Bangkok in the uk

44:13.240 --> 44:18.360
I don't know if that's the same in the u.s. But I mean there's posters everywhere for ladyboys of Bangkok

44:19.320 --> 44:21.720
to my knowledge they don't come here, but um

44:23.240 --> 44:25.240
You know, there are

44:26.120 --> 44:29.880
She mail escorts that you can find online

44:32.680 --> 44:34.680
I I knew

44:36.120 --> 44:38.120
In writing my book

44:38.440 --> 44:44.760
The 2003 book called the man who would be queen. I actually at that time knew some transsexual

44:47.400 --> 44:49.400
Prostitutes

44:50.360 --> 44:52.360
Some of whom had worked

44:53.240 --> 44:55.400
as she mail prostitutes and then they

44:56.680 --> 44:59.080
Uh got surgery and continue to work

45:00.040 --> 45:01.160
as

45:01.160 --> 45:03.160
female prostitutes

45:03.320 --> 45:04.440
um

45:04.440 --> 45:09.560
Opening opening up to as many markets as possible. Yeah. Yeah. Well the one that I'm thinking of

45:10.680 --> 45:12.680
preferred the

45:13.640 --> 45:16.600
The men who liked women to the men who liked she mails

45:17.720 --> 45:21.720
I think she thought that the ones who liked she mails

45:23.480 --> 45:24.600
Uh

45:24.600 --> 45:31.720
I don't know that they treated her differently as as a very interesting. So this is this is an obvious

45:32.200 --> 45:33.160
uh

45:33.160 --> 45:35.160
follow-up which is

45:35.240 --> 45:40.120
Is this a new category of sexual orientation? Are these people closer to gay?

45:40.760 --> 45:42.680
People or are they closer to straight people?

45:44.360 --> 45:48.440
Great question and so I can answer the second part of that question

45:49.160 --> 45:52.920
They are very close to straight people. They're not at all gay

45:53.800 --> 45:55.800
guys guys who get into she mails

45:56.680 --> 45:58.680
So if we bring these guys in the lab

45:59.400 --> 46:07.000
And we show them pornography featuring just women and the the kind that we use in this situation is two women

46:07.880 --> 46:09.880
having sex with each other

46:10.040 --> 46:12.040
female female porn and

46:12.600 --> 46:14.600
male male male porn

46:15.320 --> 46:17.320
uh, those are

46:17.320 --> 46:19.320
the kind best kind of

46:20.440 --> 46:23.720
Stimually because if somebody gets aroused there's no

46:25.080 --> 46:27.560
Ambiguity about who they're getting aroused by

46:28.520 --> 46:29.880
um

46:29.880 --> 46:33.800
Guys who are into she mails get aroused to the females but not the males

46:34.600 --> 46:37.000
But they get slightly more aroused to

46:37.880 --> 46:39.480
videos

46:39.480 --> 46:41.480
Of two she mails getting it on

46:42.200 --> 46:47.720
And that's a little different than typical straight men who get more aroused

46:48.280 --> 46:50.280
by two females

46:50.280 --> 46:52.040
than two she mails

46:52.040 --> 46:52.920
but

46:52.920 --> 46:54.920
neither

46:54.920 --> 46:56.920
Guy Nant Guy Nant or morphophiles

46:57.400 --> 46:58.760
nor

46:58.760 --> 47:01.240
regular straight men get aroused

47:01.800 --> 47:02.680
to

47:02.680 --> 47:04.200
two men getting it on

47:04.200 --> 47:05.240
right

47:05.240 --> 47:10.680
Next next obvious follow-up question to that is I've heard you say that heterosexual women are

47:11.080 --> 47:13.080
Genitally indifferent

47:13.720 --> 47:15.720
What does that mean?

47:16.200 --> 47:18.040
I would say

47:18.040 --> 47:21.480
Not just genitally indifferent. They're I think that they're

47:23.400 --> 47:25.400
Conscious feelings

47:25.400 --> 47:27.800
Are indifferent in the laboratory

47:28.600 --> 47:30.600
to erotica

47:31.160 --> 47:32.920
so

47:32.920 --> 47:34.760
If we bring

47:34.760 --> 47:39.880
Women into the lab and we show them the same kinds of stimuli two men having sex

47:40.360 --> 47:42.360
two women having sex

47:43.720 --> 47:45.720
Straight women

47:46.120 --> 47:48.120
Show an indifferent pattern

47:48.360 --> 47:51.880
Of genital arousal. They get equally aroused to both by both

47:52.680 --> 47:54.680
And they get and they say

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
They get equally aroused by both now

47:57.640 --> 47:58.680
they don't

47:58.680 --> 48:00.680
get that aroused

48:02.280 --> 48:04.120
Psychologically

48:04.120 --> 48:09.160
They don't straight women do not get as aroused to watching either kinds of

48:10.440 --> 48:12.440
erotic stimuli that I just mentioned

48:13.080 --> 48:15.080
as either straight men do

48:15.720 --> 48:17.720
or gay men do

48:17.960 --> 48:20.680
But it is interesting that they seem to show this

48:21.640 --> 48:23.320
flat pattern

48:23.320 --> 48:25.320
lesbians in contrast

48:25.320 --> 48:26.280
do

48:26.280 --> 48:27.240
show

48:27.240 --> 48:28.840
both a

48:28.840 --> 48:32.440
genital preference and a subjective preference

48:33.160 --> 48:35.800
for female stimuli is there

48:36.600 --> 48:38.840
a vestigial arousal among

48:39.480 --> 48:41.480
lesbians for men

48:44.600 --> 48:46.520
lesbians do

48:46.520 --> 48:48.520
get more aroused by

48:48.840 --> 48:50.920
male stimuli than they do

48:51.720 --> 48:53.720
to nature scenes

48:54.120 --> 48:59.960
But what about do they get more aroused to gay men than gay men do to lesbians?

49:03.080 --> 49:05.560
These questions are hard to answer

49:06.520 --> 49:10.040
These are the studies that we need Michael. These are the these are the hard

49:10.680 --> 49:15.080
charging questions that we need. Well, they're hard to answer because the kinds of

49:17.560 --> 49:19.560
apparatus that

49:19.960 --> 49:25.480
You must use to measure genital arousal and men differs from that

49:26.120 --> 49:30.440
That you must use to measure it in women and the best evidence that we have

49:31.720 --> 49:33.720
we've taken it out of

49:34.600 --> 49:37.240
the genitals into the brain. We've done

49:38.280 --> 49:40.280
fmri scanning

49:40.440 --> 49:42.440
of

49:42.520 --> 49:44.440
people

49:44.440 --> 49:46.440
looking at erotic stimuli

49:47.400 --> 49:52.600
And it pretty much shows the same patterns as the genital stuff does

49:55.640 --> 49:57.640
And your excellent question I

49:58.440 --> 50:00.440
I

50:00.680 --> 50:03.960
Think I'm gonna have to hold off answering because I don't remember

50:06.040 --> 50:11.240
That's fine. So we kind of I remember I um, I had a conversation with

50:12.200 --> 50:17.640
Christina Durante and she taught me about a study where they brought

50:20.520 --> 50:23.960
Women into a lab and they sat them down opposite

50:24.920 --> 50:32.360
Two different guys one guy was really nerdy and one guy was kind of a bad boy leather jacket and sort of like quaffed hair and stuff like that

50:33.000 --> 50:33.880
and

50:33.880 --> 50:35.080
they

50:35.080 --> 50:37.080
analyzed the

50:37.800 --> 50:39.800
verbal responses and the

50:40.920 --> 50:44.120
Physical responses that women had to each of these different men

50:45.000 --> 50:51.240
Now they had a oscar winning film writer some award-winning film writer write the script that the

50:51.960 --> 50:57.640
Gentleman actor was using so it's like, you know, if you were going to cut it the cool guys like if you come with me

50:57.640 --> 51:00.040
I'll show you the best night of your life and it's going to be really cool

51:00.040 --> 51:05.320
But I don't really care so it kind of it doesn't really matter so much very very high status prestige prestige prestige

51:05.960 --> 51:10.440
Uh, whereas on the other hand the other guy was something else. Now the interesting thing is it was the same guy

51:11.080 --> 51:16.520
The same guy was playing both roles. They just styled him differently in his mannerisms had been adjusted

51:17.160 --> 51:19.320
one of the most interesting takeaways was

51:20.280 --> 51:24.360
There was a a number of uh, lesbian female attracted women

51:25.080 --> 51:31.080
Who were in the study and when they looked at their behavior with the lower status man

51:32.280 --> 51:37.000
It seemed relatively straightforward when they looked at their behavior with the highest status man

51:37.240 --> 51:41.560
even though they had a self report of not being attracted to him and

51:41.960 --> 51:47.720
Their verbal behavior wasn't particularly forthcoming. Their non-verbal behavior was much more flirtatious

51:48.280 --> 51:54.600
So they were playing with the hair more. They were kind of leaning in they were pouting a little bit more and what that kind of

51:55.560 --> 51:58.680
Suggested to me, which I think kind of leads into some of your work

51:59.320 --> 52:01.320
is that

52:01.320 --> 52:04.200
Even for women who are not attracted to men for a very long time

52:04.920 --> 52:08.600
Men have been the gatekeepers to so much with regards to

52:09.400 --> 52:12.760
survivability reproduction protection resources, etc

52:13.400 --> 52:15.400
that it feels like even

52:16.360 --> 52:18.360
Exclusively female attracted women

52:19.720 --> 52:21.560
Just keep this

52:21.560 --> 52:27.400
Skill set in the locker room somewhere where if they need to deploy it because the chieftains come over

52:27.880 --> 52:32.600
And she's just finished up with her girlfriend that nobody knows about secretly in a in a cave somewhere

52:33.080 --> 52:35.080
uh, that she can still kind of

52:35.560 --> 52:38.200
Turn it on and I thought that that was really interesting

52:39.160 --> 52:42.680
That is really interesting. I wasn't familiar with that

52:43.320 --> 52:45.320
also, I think that

52:46.040 --> 52:48.040
lesbians

52:48.120 --> 52:51.800
Women who identify as lesbians are not as exclusively

52:53.960 --> 52:58.840
Female attracted as gay men are male attracted even if they

53:00.200 --> 53:02.200
might deny that

53:02.520 --> 53:03.960
lesbians

53:03.960 --> 53:05.960
Are more likely than gay men

53:06.680 --> 53:07.720
to

53:07.720 --> 53:09.720
Become non-lesbian

53:10.360 --> 53:13.480
You know relapse to go back. Yeah, there's

53:15.400 --> 53:21.320
A researcher named lisa diamond who has studied something she calls female fluidity which

53:22.760 --> 53:24.760
Refers to women's

53:25.400 --> 53:27.400
greater propensity

53:27.640 --> 53:29.640
to

53:30.040 --> 53:34.760
I don't know become romantically interested in somebody regardless of their

53:35.400 --> 53:37.400
natal sex and

53:37.720 --> 53:43.080
Not all women do this and there are some, you know, let's say gold star lesbians who

53:43.240 --> 53:44.360
Uh

53:44.360 --> 53:46.360
would never

53:46.360 --> 53:48.360
go for a man, but

53:49.080 --> 53:52.920
I think there are more lesbians who have the capacity

53:53.880 --> 53:55.880
For sexual attraction to men

53:56.440 --> 54:02.120
Okay, so in your opinion, then is males sexual men's sexual orientation is more fixed and

54:03.000 --> 54:04.600
Is more malleable?

54:04.600 --> 54:07.960
Absolutely, and that's that's part of the reason why men but not women

54:10.360 --> 54:12.200
Not many women

54:12.200 --> 54:15.000
Have parapherias, which are these weird

54:15.640 --> 54:17.240
sexual interests

54:17.240 --> 54:19.960
Autogonophilia is a parapheria, but some others

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
are for example

54:23.240 --> 54:28.440
Pedophilia sexual attraction to children. What's the what's the amputee one? What's that one?

54:29.080 --> 54:32.600
That is called acrotomophilia. Thank you. Yeah

54:33.720 --> 54:34.760
Right

54:34.760 --> 54:36.760
Yes, which we've been studying

54:37.080 --> 54:42.200
That there's um and zoophilia attraction to animals

54:44.120 --> 54:46.120
Uh lipophilia, which is

54:46.680 --> 54:52.760
Attraction to morbidly obese people and the guys who are into them tend to be just normal weight guys

54:53.640 --> 55:01.720
Uh, and we just we have a paper that is about to be published. It's uh accepted and I'm working on the proof now, which I think is

55:03.400 --> 55:05.640
He modestly says I think it's very interesting

55:06.520 --> 55:10.760
But we studied we we studied guys into amputees

55:11.400 --> 55:15.640
Guys into animals and guys into the really huge fat people

55:16.680 --> 55:20.280
And for each of these three kinds of parapherias

55:21.160 --> 55:23.160
A lot of these guys

55:23.320 --> 55:25.320
also have the

55:27.640 --> 55:32.520
Inversion they are sexually aroused by the idea of becoming

55:33.320 --> 55:35.320
Yes

55:35.720 --> 55:37.720
fat person and animal

55:38.760 --> 55:40.760
uh, which you know

55:42.920 --> 55:46.040
And and I think we have about 10

55:47.800 --> 55:51.880
Guys into amputees who've actually managed somehow to get amputations

55:52.440 --> 55:55.560
Wow, so I first learned this from dr. James Cantor

55:56.360 --> 56:02.920
and spoke to him about it and and he described it in this really lovely way, which was um a lot of the

56:03.320 --> 56:09.080
Sexual let's just call a lot of the parapherias that people have and and the odd fetishes that people are turned on by

56:10.040 --> 56:14.840
Is reflected both outwardly and inwardly. So there are people who are attracted to amputees

56:15.160 --> 56:18.920
There are people who see themselves as amputees. They have their limbs

56:19.160 --> 56:23.560
They have all of their limbs, but they feel like they should not they feel like they shouldn't have that

56:23.800 --> 56:26.760
He also, uh, I don't know whether you believe that this is true

56:27.160 --> 56:29.560
Said that there are people who are attracted to children

56:29.960 --> 56:32.680
And there are people who see themselves as children

56:33.080 --> 56:37.880
There are men often who want to be dressed up as babies. We did the first study of this

56:38.600 --> 56:40.120
Kevin my

56:40.120 --> 56:45.160
PhD student Kevin sue and I did a first study of auto pedophilia and

56:46.280 --> 56:49.800
That's right. Uh, and the most ethical form of pedophilia

56:51.000 --> 56:54.760
Yeah, and when a really interesting finding of that, um

56:55.400 --> 56:57.240
study was that

56:57.240 --> 57:01.400
Men some of these men are attracted to boys. Some are attracted to girls

57:02.120 --> 57:05.480
Well, the the guys who are attracted to girls

57:06.840 --> 57:11.480
Are sexually aroused by the idea of being a little girl

57:13.080 --> 57:15.080
Not a little boy, which is interesting

57:16.760 --> 57:20.280
So you have it that is a great way to

57:20.760 --> 57:21.880
prove

57:21.880 --> 57:25.320
That the relationship outwardly and inwardly is the same

57:25.720 --> 57:32.840
Yeah, because otherwise you wouldn't have this relationship between the two. That's so interesting. Why is everyone not a sex researcher?

57:32.920 --> 57:38.920
Why is everyone not doing para paraffilia sex research the same way? Yeah, so interesting

57:39.800 --> 57:41.800
Oh, okay. So

57:41.800 --> 57:49.640
In your opinion does bisexuality truly exist in men like how how accurate do you think the stereotype is that bisexual women

57:49.960 --> 57:52.360
Are really straight and that bisexual men are really gay

57:55.560 --> 58:00.600
In I think it was 2005 we published a paper

58:02.360 --> 58:03.720
Um

58:03.720 --> 58:06.280
That failed to find evidence

58:07.480 --> 58:10.280
That male bisexuality truly existed

58:11.000 --> 58:12.120
where

58:12.120 --> 58:15.880
By that, I mean that men in the laboratory would show

58:16.840 --> 58:19.240
Arousal to both men and to women

58:20.760 --> 58:25.000
Uh that did not did not make us popular. We were um

58:25.640 --> 58:28.280
You know it got us into the news but not

58:28.920 --> 58:30.360
liked

58:30.360 --> 58:34.360
We have kept studying this by we I and my

58:34.920 --> 58:39.080
Then graduate student now. He's a professor in england garyl freeger

58:40.680 --> 58:42.760
And we've uh gotten

58:44.520 --> 58:46.520
several hundred

58:47.160 --> 58:49.160
Uh

58:50.200 --> 58:53.160
Several hundred uh subjects in the lab

58:53.880 --> 59:00.440
And uh two years ago we published in proceedings of national academy of sciences

59:01.400 --> 59:03.400
A paper in which we

59:05.160 --> 59:10.200
Showed beyond the shadow of a doubt that male bisexuality truly exists

59:12.360 --> 59:14.360
Um

59:14.920 --> 59:17.880
There is a subset of bisexual men who

59:18.520 --> 59:23.960
Clearly produce arousal to male stimuli and to female stimuli

59:26.760 --> 59:31.960
Most of them are somewhat more aroused by one sex than by the other. They're not exactly

59:32.520 --> 59:42.280
Into predominantly gay or a predominantly straight bisexual man. Yeah. Yeah, but they're they're a bit bisexual. Yes. So I now

59:43.960 --> 59:46.520
Believe for sure in male bisexuality

59:47.480 --> 59:49.480
At the same time

59:50.040 --> 59:52.040
If you talk to gay men

59:53.800 --> 59:57.640
Ask just ask them this question. Did you ever say you were bisexual?

59:58.440 --> 01:00:00.440
About half of gay men will say yeah

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:03.400
Then you say well, were you really bisexual in the same? No

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:06.440
So it really does

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:09.400
happen that

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:11.480
Some men misrepresent

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:15.400
Being bisexual, but it also seems to happen that

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:22.600
Some men are bisexual as I would understand that understood, but it's a small cohort and also

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:26.920
You it's difficult to stress test whether this is the thin end of the wedge

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:29.640
en route to becoming a

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:36.040
Fully fledged member of the gay community or whether you're actually going to just stop at the letter b. Yeah, that's interesting

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:38.200
um

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:44.760
What what about environmental influences on sexual orientation? So we have at the moment

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:47.800
in korea

01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:55.160
A very sort of sex negative culture, which you'll probably be familiar with where there is the four b's movement women who are recanting

01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:59.960
I can't remember what the four different b's stand for it in korean, but it's it's men

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:05.640
and patriarchy and family and work or kids or something like that and it is

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:08.280
downstream of a whatever

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:13.320
less than one birth rate and it kind of just it's everything's korea is just a mess, but

01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:17.320
That seems like whether it be

01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:21.800
outright celibacy slash abstinence or

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:25.960
Turning to lesbianism. I don't know whether that's true

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:30.920
That is a sexual orientation response

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:38.200
To an ecological or environmental cue right something has happened that has changed maybe the sex ratio

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:39.880
maybe the

01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:43.640
Mate value of the potential available partners that are around

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:48.600
Downstream from that we have declining birth rates across the west, too

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:54.520
We have an increase in cohort of high performing women and an increase in cohort of underperforming men

01:01:55.720 --> 01:02:01.080
Hypogamously that means that maybe women are going to be struggling to find men that are of the mate value that they would desire

01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:04.760
Even though we're in a society which has been the most sort of sex positive

01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:09.640
Ostensibly than it's ever been. I think that there is a bit of a sex recession going on. There's a great

01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:13.240
Article in the Atlantic about this

01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:15.560
So with all of this folded together

01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:21.000
How how malleable is sexual orientation in response to the local environment?

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.440
And could you foresee a future given where we're at?

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:29.400
Sexually and with the mating crisis at the moment that this could continue in the future

01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:36.840
This is another one of those times when it's important to distinguish

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:41.160
Male and female sexuality

01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:46.280
And this is what i'm going to say is speculative because

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:53.000
This hasn't been established and there's a lot of disagreement, but my

01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:56.200
gut sense is that

01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:59.800
Men's sexuality is not going to be responsive

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:03.320
to

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:05.880
Cultural pressure much

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:08.840
I say much

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:13.640
Because there are parts of the world where men will have sex

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:16.600
with other men

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:19.720
Other males let's not call them men

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:21.880
Men

01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:28.280
If the males are presenting as very feminine and perhaps

01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:30.680
transgender

01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:33.160
so for example in samoa, there's uh

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:35.880
natal males

01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:36.760
who

01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:40.040
are considered a third sex called the fa fa fina

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:43.880
And you got the lady boys and tylen and so on

01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:47.800
It's pretty common for just plain old straight men

01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:53.480
To have sex with these natal males now. I don't think that makes them gay

01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:57.160
They're not having sex with men. They're

01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:01.080
Seeing these people as female like

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.840
But

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:07.000
I don't think there's anything

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:12.920
Any kind of cultural change even if I could build society from the ground up

01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:15.720
that would make

01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:18.040
Straight men

01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:21.160
Want to have sex with each other

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:23.960
uh

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:29.720
I think women are likely different and more responsive to cultural factors

01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:34.680
Uh and perhaps also things like um

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:41.160
Bad experiences with men there's a uh, you know this belief

01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:43.560
that

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:46.840
One route to lesbianism is being mistreated by men

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:51.400
We don't know that's true, but I find it plausible

01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:55.240
But I don't think that uh women mistreating

01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:58.360
Men is going to make them go gay

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:05.240
No, that's fascinating. One thing that I've been considering a lot as you've been talking about the

01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:09.560
thin line between what being gay means

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:11.720
physically

01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:13.720
And what it means

01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:17.800
In terms of appearance

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:19.960
You know, there's an interesting question

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:21.880
is a

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:23.720
very voluptuous

01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:26.040
big boob big lips long hair

01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:28.600
um

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:30.040
Thailand

01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:32.280
lady boy type presenting person

01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:35.400
more female

01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:36.440
than

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:38.440
a very shaven head

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:39.480
uh

01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:41.480
sort of more androgynous body

01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:42.520
type

01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:43.960
but

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:45.800
vagina owning

01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:47.240
woman

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:51.240
And there's a really interesting question going on here. You know that you highlighted there it is

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:53.880
In some or it's referred to as a third gender

01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:59.800
You know, there's a lot of um accusations from the left of genital fetishism, which you might have heard of

01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:06.620
Which is that you're actually being uh, you're addicted to the genitals as opposed to the presentation

01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:08.360
but

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:10.360
There is an interesting question given that

01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:15.480
Our sexuality is so

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:18.200
easily fooled. We are such

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.640
rampant sexual beings that a

01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:24.440
six inch by four inch screen

01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:30.760
That has a small depiction of sex happening on it is enough to fool our brain to think

01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:35.880
There's some sex happening here. No, there isn't there was some sex happening there

01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:40.120
A long time ago and now you can see around the side of it. You know that it's not here

01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:45.480
You know that you're not getting any of this. It's and that that illusion is responsible for the internet

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:48.680
correct, correct. Yeah, so

01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:55.960
My point being that you you already can see as soon as you accept the fact that porn is an effective stimuli

01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:02.680
You accept the fact that it is not exclusively about the action. It's about the presentation, right?

01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:09.400
Is it just a difference of degree not a difference of kind all the way down to

01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:12.920
the more

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:19.000
Female presenting regardless of whether it's a xx or xy chromosome person

01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:24.680
It it really starts to blur the line between what is and is not classed as

01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:29.160
Same sex or an opposite sex attracted sexual orientation

01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:33.320
Yeah, I think that all we have

01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:37.400
for the most part are our senses are

01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:44.360
And you know men especially but humans in general are very visual species and

01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:50.600
You're absolutely right that some trans women even those who still have a penis

01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:54.120
Can look

01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:56.200
Quite

01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:58.200
They look like really attractive women

01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:06.040
Although often you can kind of see the remnants of their maleness and their bone structure or something like that, but

01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:10.680
Yeah, I and I think that

01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:14.120
In those cases

01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:16.040
men who

01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:18.040
don't feel

01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:20.200
Attracted to them or say they don't

01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:24.520
That's more likely to be

01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:32.680
Uh mental, um, you know some kind of a version an idea like that person is

01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:38.440
A man not a woman. So despite the fact that they look like a really attracted

01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:41.160
Woman, I can't go there

01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:43.320
um

01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:47.720
Yeah, it's so fascinating because I've seen this, you know, I've seen this argument happen on on

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:50.920
dating shows or on

01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:54.600
Right-wing commentary channels and stuff like that around

01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:58.200
No, because that would be gay. I'm like, is it

01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:04.280
Is it more gay to have sex with what looks like a nine out of ten woman

01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:08.920
body shape size voice presentation actions everything

01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:11.480
with a penis

01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:18.360
Then it is to have the exact opposite all of the presentation factors of a man could be on testosterone could be all of the rest of it

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:25.720
But has a vagina that it and it's a really really fascinating question. You know, there's sort of

01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:33.080
It falls in line with a number of other arguments. There's sort of more biological essentialism side of things, especially the people that would say

01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:37.560
Um, unless you can change your chromosomes and even not then if you're a natal male

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:41.240
I'm calling you a man if you're a natal female. I'm calling you a woman for the rest of time

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:44.840
Um, so it's a a suite of beliefs

01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:50.280
I suppose all of which are into play with each other and would also cascade down from that, but um

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Yeah, it's a it's a really really fascinating

01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:56.680
consideration around what it means and this is when you get into the

01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:03.400
deeper and deeper into the layers of paraphernalia and and the nuances of sexual orientation it all kind of starts to

01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:06.440
break apart. It's like the quantum level of of

01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:09.400
sex research, I suppose

01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:15.320
Yes, yes, we we are going on the outskirts here

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:21.960
Um, what about people's gay dars? Do you think that most of us have an accurate gay dars?

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:26.600
Yeah, this is again something we've studied quite a bit

01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:31.880
And yeah, but people have a much better than chance

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:35.800
Gaydar

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:37.800
Now it's not perfect

01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:41.240
but they are much better at than chance

01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:42.840
at

01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:44.840
discerning whether a man

01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:48.040
Is gay or straight and they

01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:50.360
rely

01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:53.000
So gay men, you know just their

01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:56.600
outward appearance

01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:59.160
In the west currently is not necessarily

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:01.400
very feminine

01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:04.120
Although I I think gay men might

01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:10.680
present themselves more attractively than straight men, but it's more things like movement

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:13.480
you know

01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:20.920
And speech speech patterns are yeah, you found there's like a gay accent. There's a gay accent. Yes

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:23.160
What is the gay accent?

01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:31.720
So we we know it when we hear it and and you know actors can often

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:34.840
effect the gay accent even if they're straight

01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:40.200
There's interestingly there's a lesbian accent too

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
I I think a gay accent

01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:45.640
may tend to be more expressive

01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:49.000
and gay men articulate more clearly

01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:56.520
than straight men and lesbians have the opposite they're less expressive and they don't articulate as clearly

01:11:57.240 --> 01:12:03.400
Do you think is that in any way gay men modeling female speech patterns? Are there any

01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:08.440
Parallels there? Yeah, you you ask great questions and the you know

01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:13.320
So nobody knows and I I think there are two at least two

01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:16.920
good hypoxies there one is that

01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:22.040
Unconsciously growing up gay men

01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:24.520
And

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:26.840
You know some of them they had

01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:31.480
somewhat feminine gender identity and they

01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:34.360
did model

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:38.520
The other is that there's something about gay men's brain, which is

01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:42.360
somewhat feminized and produces this speech pattern

01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:44.840
Nobody know

01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:46.840
well when it comes to the

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:52.280
Ability to present clearly my speech coach that I use for the podcast is gay

01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:56.360
Classically trained in theater classically trained in improv

01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:03.000
For not just an outrageous communicator and probably the best communicator

01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:06.840
That I've had on the show is Douglas Murray who is also

01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:11.640
Him and Miles my speech coach are like two peas in a pod that have never met

01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:15.080
But just phenomenal like

01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:19.320
Out of this world precision with his ability to

01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:24.440
Remain cool under pressure to be able to communicate in a very precise way

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
to be able to use

01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:31.720
inflection and drama and whimsy and to then be able to pull it back without being

01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:34.360
Fragile just phenomenal and so yeah

01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:39.320
I I wonder Andrew Doyle as well satirist from the uk that runs the titanium agrath

01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:42.760
Twitter account. I wonder I wonder whether

01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:47.720
Being gay is a competitive advantage in the world of online commentary, perhaps

01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:53.720
But yeah, it's all of that stuff so interesting and you write as all that you kind of

01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:57.480
I I don't think I've been around sufficient

01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:01.720
Lesbians to be able to say that I would I could pick up on that

01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:04.920
The only real things that I ever notice

01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:10.040
With lesbians are sort of the it's the dress. I think that

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:18.120
Lesbian lesbians seem to dress significantly more differently to normal women than gays do to normal men

01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:21.480
Yeah, the the plaid shirts the baggy jeans

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:23.880
um

01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:25.880
Yeah gay gay men

01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:27.320
dress

01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:30.120
somewhat differently more stylishly at least

01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:34.120
It's just better usually. Yeah, that's right. That's right

01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:37.080
Yeah, very funny

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:46.440
What was that paper that you did about male mate value being more malleable than female mate value?

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:49.400
No, that's an old one

01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:51.800
um

01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:56.840
Yeah, the student who was the lead author on that was interested in the

01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:00.360
Explaining the sex difference in the

01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:03.160
In depression women are more likely to get

01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:05.720
depressed than

01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:08.520
Men are and she hypothesized that

01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:11.720
it could be because

01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:16.600
You know women's mate value is more tied to

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:20.680
their looks which she said you can't

01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:27.000
Do that much about whereas men it's their accomplishments which you can and

01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:30.200
um, and she got some evidence for that

01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:32.280
I'm not sure that I

01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:35.560
That's you know an old paper and I'm not sure I believe

01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:38.360
the theory because you know

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:42.040
If women if women really can't do that much

01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:52.200
About their looks what's the cosmetics industry doing? I mean, uh, and you know, it's it's not that easy for a man to

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
go out and double his income

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.840
so

01:15:56.840 --> 01:15:59.400
Anyway, but that that's what the paper was about

01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:02.780
Yeah, so I find I had a conversation

01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:06.360
with ed hagan as well recently

01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:12.200
And ed did a study where they controlled for upper body strength

01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:18.520
When looking at differences in depression and anxiety and when you control for upper body strength the differences between men and women

01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:22.120
Get smaller and smaller and smaller and then essentially go away

01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:25.880
um, and the the the reason that I was interested in

01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:33.560
Discussing a malleability of mate value is that it's it's a common discussion that's had on the internet and it's born out of

01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:36.840
A contest between men and women about who's got it worse

01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:39.720
It's like well, it's easy for you

01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:41.800
because you just need to go and

01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:45.640
Get a boob job, but I can't make myself any tall taller and women would say well

01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:46.920
It's easy for you

01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:51.480
Because you know at 21 I reached my peak sexual market value and it's all downhill from there

01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:56.120
And you get to continue to accrue status and resources and it's very much sort of um

01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:00.120
two people talking different languages that

01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:03.480
the

01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:08.920
Sexual brains that the sexual attraction mechanism that works for men what they want from women and for women

01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:12.280
What they want from men are not the same. It's not you can't

01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:14.920
play

01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:18.760
A balancing act here. There is no ability to work out the equity

01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:23.480
There's no exchange rate between these two like how many boob jobs is three inches of height worth

01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:26.680
Do you know what I mean like there is no way of us doing it?

01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:32.680
Oh, well, you could wear high heels and put makeup on but you can go out for five years and increase your earning potential by

01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:36.760
40% like what what does that even mean when we're talking about this?

01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:39.080
um

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:43.640
I had a theory which I think maybe total horse shit, so I'm going to try and bring it back up again

01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:46.200
I had a theory that

01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:48.200
um

01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:51.480
Male mate value to the individual

01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:57.560
To the individual is more malleable and to the group is less malleable and female

01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:03.000
Individual mate value is less less malleable and to the group. It's more malleable that

01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:09.480
You basically have as a man there are more degrees of freedom that you can move yourself on

01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:15.080
And there is a longer timeline that you can do it on specifically because of the fact that you know

01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:17.080
a guy who's

01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:18.680
35 is

01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:21.960
More attractive than a guy who's 25 to most women on average

01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:25.720
And I don't know when that peaks probably in your mid mid to late 30s, perhaps

01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:33.000
But even then, you know, Leonardo DiCaprio has been acquiring and disposing of under 25 year old girlfriends

01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:35.480
regularly for like two decades now

01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:39.880
So with sufficient status and resources you can continue to cycle through that

01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:41.640
um

01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:47.880
But yeah, what what do you what's your mindset at now when it comes to malleability, especially with us facing this mating crisis and

01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:50.120
and people having concerns around

01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:53.400
Being able to be seen by the other sex

01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:57.240
Well, I I think that

01:18:57.640 --> 01:19:01.320
In the sense that I understand you I think we're probably very malleable

01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:05.640
The culture has changed tremendously

01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:10.760
You know in a fairly short time and it's kind of

01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:13.160
guessing it will

01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:20.280
Change tremendously still I hope it changes back in certain ways because I'm not that happy with certain things now

01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:25.640
But that's a different question than do I know how to change it and I do not

01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:29.160
And that that

01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:31.320
has to do with

01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:33.320
male female interactions

01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:38.360
As much as academic freedom both of which well the latter concerns me more now

01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:45.160
Michael Bailey ladies and gentlemen Michael, I really really appreciate your work any opportunity to dig into

01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:52.920
People that are looking into sex is is fascinating for me. I've immensely enjoyed talking to you. I I hope that we get

01:19:55.640 --> 01:20:00.360
More chances either in person or back here whatever I have

01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:07.960
I have a laundry list of things that we didn't get to talk about to do with sexual arousal patterns virtuous pedophiles

01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:09.800
the

01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:15.320
Birth order effect of homosexuality so we can absolutely run this back. Let me know once your new paper is out
