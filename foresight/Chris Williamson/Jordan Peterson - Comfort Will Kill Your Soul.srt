1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
Talking about the individual one of the things that I see holding people back is comfort

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,240
So it's easy to get life to a stage where it's not that bad

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,760
But it's not that good either at least when you have a full-on breakdown

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,000
There's only one way to go right you're only going to go up from there

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,560
But I think it's possible to wallow for years in a just about passable life

6
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:26,600
Right sedated by comfort and I see this temptation in myself as well to give up the good for the great

7
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,400
What would you say to people who are trying to escape this curse of mediocrity?

8
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,320
Well, if you're satisfied with it in some fundamental sense

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,520
I mean, there's there's something to be said

10
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,360
I suppose for walling off of private space for yourself if you can maintain it and

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Detaching yourself to some degree from the troubles of the world and

12
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:54,600
Maintaining your own little private garden the problem with that is the snakes tend to seep in from the outside, right?

13
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,040
It's it's pretty difficult to wall yourself off in any real sense from the concerns of the world

14
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,640
So it isn't clear to me that that's a viable solution

15
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:08,480
It also means that you might justify to yourself lack of civic engagement, you know, I shouldn't go to church

16
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:15,380
I shouldn't take part in the political process because it's all so corrupt. I should hide myself from all the annoying

17
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,680
Noise that's generated constantly on the media front and I have some sympathy for that viewpoint, but I

18
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,160
Don't believe it's really possible because you can't have

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,800
You can't have a walled garden independent of

20
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,200
Independently of the health of the broader society. It's just not possible. Maybe you can have it for a very short period of time

21
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,040
but so

22
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:45,400
But if you're if you're comfortable with what you have and it's Jen it's genuine comfort and I think okay, but generally

23
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,160
It's not I think for the most part. It's it's people that have become sedated, you know

24
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:54,240
They've forgotten their dreams, but they've forgotten that they've forgotten them pink Floyd's comfortably numb is about this, right?

25
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,800
They've become comfortably numb. I think most people said I have this friend and this this story really hit me

26
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,960
So during the pandemic

27
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,520
Running a podcast

28
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,880
I was able to have the thing that I feel I'm good at my artistic

29
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,240
Pursuit and outlet that was available for me to continue. It was actually increased because I didn't have other stuff to do

30
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,640
now have a friend that's a barber and

31
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,720
He got a job at a supermarket barbers shut down for a long period of time

32
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,960
He got to job at a supermarket stacking shelves overnight and I asked him I was like man

33
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,440
How are you? How are you finding the new job? This is a big a big change. He's like, do you know what it is?

34
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,400
I

35
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,600
Actually don't mind the work and mind the people that I work with mm-hmm

36
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:40,000
But man, I miss being good at something right, right, right. Well, dude that hit me. Yeah, so hard, right

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,520
I missed being good at something. Yeah. Yeah, well people need the opportunity to be good at something

38
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,880
It so then you might ask yourself. Well, what's the best antidote to the discomfort of life?

39
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,760
and you might say well, it's comfort and I

40
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,960
Suppose that's what you act out when you swaddle a baby

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,640
but a better antidote is something like adventure to excellence and

42
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:14,560
That's far better antidote to suffering than the mere absence of suffering

43
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,600
So

44
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,720
Not to say that the mere absence of suffering. That's not nothing, you know, stepping out of that

45
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,880
Sedation from comforts difficult that especially if you've become routine eyes to it. Yeah, well, that's the difficult

46
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,480
Difficulty of maturity. You know the Freudians said very wisely that the good mother necessarily fails

47
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,480
What's that mean?

48
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:43,000
I mean, she stops providing the comfort that insulates people against the need for adventure. I heard you say recently that

49
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:50,480
A mother's ability to let her child go out into the world knowing that they're still vulnerable and that it's now

50
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,320
Down to them and the world still look after them. That's one of the bravest things that it's the female crucifixion

51
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,360
So and that's exemplified best in well the best

52
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,720
Portrayal of that I've seen is Michelangelo's pieta. You know, it's it's a statue of Mary

53
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:15,440
And she has Christ's body on her as an adult on her lap and he's broken and destroyed and you know, she's displaying that

54
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,240
That's

55
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:26,320
That's the bravery of a mother to allow that to happen, but not only that to to facilitate it

56
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:34,360
Facilitate it. So what about we go kid? Where you go? Where you go? Well, why it's dangerous out there. It's like, yeah, no kidding

57
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,920
It's more dangerous here if you stay with me by a lot

58
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,560
So you might lose your body out there in the world, but if you stay here you lose your soul

59
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:55,520
How do you see that as an individual let's say that there isn't the mother there that's pushing you along

60
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,640
Well, you know, one of the things young Carl Jung

61
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:07,440
Was very interested in the edible complex and that's basically that overprotective maternal and

62
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,960
he

63
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,800
He criticized Freud or presuming that it was

64
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,480
Really something the mother did

65
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:24,280
He says it's more relational than that first of all it would be something the father would allow to happen assuming there was a father around

66
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,640
So let's not forget about the paternal contribution to allowing that to occur

67
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,640
Because in some sense, it's the father's role to

68
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,640
Serve as the antithesis of that maternal over protection

69
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:42,760
So a woman is extremely bonded with her infant say between zero and nine months and the infant is utterly helpless

70
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:48,920
And so complete compassion and the provision of comfort is the only job that matters

71
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:53,440
And that's really the case and then the woman has to switch gears to some degree

72
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,040
The mother has to switch gears as the child starts to become more

73
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:06,060
More mobile fundamentally and more independent. She has to let go of the infant, which is a real grieving process and

74
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,800
She has to start to facilitate this movement towards independence

75
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:18,240
But that's a hard shift and so partly the role of the father in that is to be an advocate for the child's independence and to

76
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:24,600
Comfort the mother to let her know that that degree of security provision is no longer necessary, but also to

77
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,120
Act as an advocate for the child's outgoing

78
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,840
Outgoing desire and so so it's the edible situation is not only the mother

79
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:40,760
It's also say the weak father, but then it's also the child so you can imagine because you don't

80
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,920
believe that these

81
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,640
negotiated agreements were

82
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,960
We're relational so, you know, you're six

83
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,680
You're in grade one

84
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,160
Maybe you're feeling a little ill

85
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,000
Maybe you're not

86
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,280
Maybe you're playing with being a little ill and maybe you're playing with exaggerating how ill you are and your mom comes downstairs and says

87
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,160
You know, you've got a test today at school. Maybe you haven't quite prepared for it. Maybe, you know, you should have and

88
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,240
She says but you know, you you seem to have a tummy ache

89
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,120
Maybe you're too sick to go to school and the kid thinks

90
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,360
Maybe I could just stay home and

91
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:28,760
You know, mom could tuck me in and I wouldn't have to take that test and I wouldn't have to confront the world and he says, yeah

92
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,720
Yeah, mom my stomach really hurts and

93
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,320
and away we go and

94
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,480
The child has made a choice and you think well, that's and that's a catastrophic choice

95
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,600
And you think well children shouldn't be held accountable for choices. They make at that age. It's like

96
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,480
That child soon gonna be an adult that's going to make very similar decisions

97
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:58,880
The the choice has consequences and to be held accountable for that is to recognize purely that the choice has consequences

98
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,000
And that it is a choice now, you know, you could say well

99
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:08,600
95% of the blame is to be put on the mother and maybe that's an overestimate. I think it probably is but

100
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,240
the child could say mom you don't have to worry about me. I'm gonna get up and go do this and

101
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,720
That's choice and

102
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,280
That's the right choice

103
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,760
so these are always chicken and egg problems obviously but

104
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:32,880
That that fleshes out the complexity of the situation, you know, if you're if you're being enticed down a pathological road

105
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,320
You can accept or reject the invitation now

106
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:44,280
Some people are better at enticing and some people enforce it more harshly and you know, there's all sorts of individual variability in situations like this, but

107
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:50,320
Just because you're offered debate doesn't necessarily mean that you have to take it

108
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:56,000
So and I'm not a determinist. I do believe that people have free will whatever that means

109
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,680
That's a murky subject and it gets complicated the more you look at it

110
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:07,200
But whatever it's still a good shorthand way of describing the fact that we seem to be

111
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:12,000
Cursed with responsibility for our own destiny at least to some degree
