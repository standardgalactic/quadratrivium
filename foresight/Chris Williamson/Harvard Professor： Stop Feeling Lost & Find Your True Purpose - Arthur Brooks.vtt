00:00.000 --> 00:07.040
What's do most people get wrong when they think about happiness they think that they can be happy and

00:08.040 --> 00:10.040
Happiness is not a destination. It's a direction

00:10.560 --> 00:12.840
One of the most important things that we've lost

00:13.120 --> 00:18.960
Sido particularly in the current generation of young adults is thinking that if you're unhappy for any particular reason

00:19.120 --> 00:23.120
Something's wrong. Something's abnormal and that's completely incorrect

00:23.200 --> 00:28.680
We have negative emotions for a reason that they make us feel unhappy the negative emotions are signal

00:28.680 --> 00:32.080
That something's aversive outside of us and that's not gonna change

00:32.080 --> 00:35.360
We need sadness and anger and fear and disgust furthermore

00:35.360 --> 00:38.760
We actually need negative experiences so that we can learn and grow

00:39.560 --> 00:44.320
Happiness is a direction and therefore we shouldn't be trying to attain happiness

00:44.320 --> 00:51.000
We should be trying to attain happy urness, which is obviously a neologism, but that gets the point across that's that's mistake number one

00:52.040 --> 00:58.360
What is an analogy that people can use to understand how happiness isn't a destination?

00:58.360 --> 01:05.760
We we think of happiness as a thing we think of happiness as a feeling a state an affect that we arrive at

01:08.120 --> 01:10.920
What's a what's another way that you can explain this

01:12.760 --> 01:14.920
Disquieting of what happiness is

01:14.920 --> 01:20.800
Happiness as we talk about it is really a state compared to something else and it's a long kind of a number line

01:20.800 --> 01:26.480
We we're getting happier means happier than what is what it comes down to and it's just it's a it's kind of a

01:26.760 --> 01:32.040
It's a status in which we have these macro nutrients more or less in equilibrium

01:32.040 --> 01:35.240
You'll never be perfectly healthy, but you can be healthier

01:35.320 --> 01:39.720
You you're never going to eat a perfectly nutritious diet, but it can be more

01:40.720 --> 01:47.200
Nutritious than yesterday. What's more nutritious than yesterday? Well, you have a good for example macro nutrient balance to your diet

01:47.200 --> 01:53.600
I'm a healthy nutrition nerd as are you and and we know that you you got to get your macros right

01:53.680 --> 02:00.000
You have to have you be paying attention to your protein carbohydrates and fat and have them more or less in balance and proportion and relative abundance

02:00.000 --> 02:06.400
The same thing is true for your happiness. So I start happiness discussions by saying there's three macro nutrients for happiness

02:06.400 --> 02:10.320
Just like there's three macro nutrients for food that you have to get right

02:10.320 --> 02:12.320
They are enjoyment

02:12.320 --> 02:18.440
Satisfaction and meaning those are the three things to pursue and everybody can get better at those three things

02:18.480 --> 02:23.320
That's an analogy that people can actually particularly people that would be wanting to improve themselves

02:23.320 --> 02:28.040
That's why they're listening to modern wisdom that they would actually help them understand the whole process

02:28.680 --> 02:33.240
What is the truth behind people who try to be happy and make themselves less happy?

02:34.760 --> 02:38.520
What they're trying to do is to feel good all the time, you know back in the 60s

02:39.320 --> 02:44.200
Uh, you don't remember this. I barely remember this the hippies used to say if it feels good do it

02:44.760 --> 02:47.720
I remember my dad hearing that and saying that's the end of america

02:48.360 --> 02:49.880
He was kind of right

02:49.880 --> 02:55.080
The problem is that that people still think that feeling good is

02:55.640 --> 03:02.280
Is is the happiness state and they're trying to feel good all the time as opposed to having a a tangible set of goals

03:02.440 --> 03:05.720
Like I am going to enjoy my life in a better way

03:06.040 --> 03:08.280
That's more stable and it's not just looking for pleasure

03:08.520 --> 03:15.000
I am going to try to achieve things in my life with goals and direction that gives me adequate access to satisfaction

03:15.320 --> 03:18.440
And I am going to do what it takes to find the meaning of my life

03:18.520 --> 03:24.920
Even if it hurts those are strategies that actually lead us to live a much better life with actually a lot more happiness

03:25.800 --> 03:31.640
Right. So what is the relationship between feelings and happiness then because presumably this uh

03:32.360 --> 03:34.920
conglomeration of different contributing macronutrients

03:35.560 --> 03:42.680
Arrives us at a state of some kind. There is an outcome of some kind if that isn't happiness

03:43.160 --> 03:44.600
What is it?

03:44.600 --> 03:50.200
So feelings are evidence of happiness like the smell of your dinner is evidence of dinner

03:50.760 --> 03:56.920
What happens is if you're you're you're achieving these states adequate states of enjoyment satisfaction and meaning

03:57.160 --> 04:04.200
You will get a better mood balance such that you're enjoying more joy and interest and you know a positive surprise

04:04.360 --> 04:09.960
And you're you're suffering less from avoidable levels of disgust and sadness and anger and fear

04:10.280 --> 04:15.160
And that mood balance will be evidence that you're actually on the right track with the macronutrients that you're getting

04:15.160 --> 04:21.320
In the same way by the way, chris that you'll have a lot more energy if your macronutrients in your diet are are actually on point

04:22.280 --> 04:24.280
right, so in this way

04:25.240 --> 04:29.960
Is it advisable for people to sort of turn the bar stool upside down and think

04:30.600 --> 04:33.800
Rather i'm not happy. That is a problem to

04:34.520 --> 04:37.480
My current state is not one i would describe as happiness

04:37.720 --> 04:41.960
That's an indicator that one of the three macronutrients is missing from my life diet

04:42.440 --> 04:47.960
That's right and and every single person i've ever met in my whole life and i perhaps besides the dalai lama

04:48.600 --> 04:54.440
Has has issues in their macronutrient profile that can lead to progress. This is really good news by the way

04:54.440 --> 05:00.280
You know one of the most deleterious things that we say to young adults today and our kids is you're perfect just the way you are

05:00.520 --> 05:02.520
What could be more depressing than that?

05:02.600 --> 05:04.600
It's like i feel i feel

05:04.600 --> 05:08.200
Garbage and you're telling me i'm perfect just the way i am that means i can't make progress

05:08.600 --> 05:13.320
The truth is everybody can make progress because i've never met a single human being

05:13.720 --> 05:18.200
That is perfect in enjoyment and satisfaction and meaning and i have a whole set of protocols

05:18.600 --> 05:22.280
That will help people understand where they can make progress and where they need to make progress

05:23.240 --> 05:25.000
What is the

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
current state of modern

05:27.000 --> 05:30.280
Happiness what does the research tell us because we're hearing stories

05:31.720 --> 05:35.640
Feelings of listlessness and hopelessness and disconnection and all the rest of it

05:36.200 --> 05:38.920
What is the weather report for 2024 happiness?

05:39.640 --> 05:40.600
so

05:40.600 --> 05:44.760
Well like the owl was saying that in the in the advertisements your results may vary

05:45.800 --> 05:50.040
Because you can be doing a lot right when society isn't unfortunately society

05:50.600 --> 05:54.520
As we understand it particularly in the oecd countries in the western industrialized countries

05:54.840 --> 05:59.240
Happiness is going in the wrong direction and we actually understand why but here the basic data

05:59.800 --> 06:05.080
Most of the western countries the industrialized nations have been ticking about a half point down

06:05.240 --> 06:09.000
Every year in the percentage of the population that says i am very happy about my life

06:09.480 --> 06:11.400
so typically you know going back to about

06:12.120 --> 06:15.560
1980s 1990 in the united states for example

06:16.280 --> 06:20.360
About 35 percent of the population said i'm very happy about my life

06:20.840 --> 06:26.280
About 15 percent said i'm not happy about my life and the other half was i'm somewhat happy

06:26.520 --> 06:31.160
That's kind of the general proportions and there's better ways to measure it with greater granularity but that gives me an idea

06:31.160 --> 06:35.560
What's happening you've been finding that that's ticking down so such that for the first time now

06:36.280 --> 06:41.240
Not happy is higher than very happy and that's consistently happening now over the past few years

06:41.560 --> 06:45.400
So that's been just this gradual decline now. Some people are getting a lot happier

06:45.400 --> 06:49.240
But society in general is seeing this and this is largely being

06:49.800 --> 06:56.840
Pulled down by certain demographics. You find young adults are less way way less happy than they used to be especially young women

06:57.480 --> 07:01.160
Especially young women with very progressive political views. They're

07:02.040 --> 07:06.520
I mean really really declining and there's one little subgroup, which is men my age

07:07.640 --> 07:11.960
That and and this has to obviously this has to do with macroeconomic factors, etc, etc

07:12.200 --> 07:13.160
so

07:13.160 --> 07:17.960
This is these are interesting questions from a kind of a policy perspective a sociological perspective

07:18.200 --> 07:20.760
But more importantly from a psychological and personal

07:21.480 --> 07:23.880
Strategy perspective such that we can live better lives

07:24.680 --> 07:28.200
What do you lay the decline of happiness at the feet of psychologically?

07:29.160 --> 07:33.960
There's kind of climate factors and weather factors and I don't mean that literally that's a metaphor too

07:34.040 --> 07:35.800
It's kind of like you and me dating is a metaphor

07:35.800 --> 07:41.080
So the climate is the climate of faith family friendship and work in this country

07:41.480 --> 07:47.160
Those are the habits of the happiest people. There's tons of literature out there that give you 10 000 happiness habits

07:47.560 --> 07:52.600
Okay, but they're all trivial compared to the big four, which is your faith or life philosophy

07:52.920 --> 07:54.920
Though the y of your existence

07:55.160 --> 08:00.200
Metaphysically that will make you small and the universe large. You must transcend yourself

08:00.280 --> 08:05.160
You'll be stuck in the tedious psychodrama of of christness. I mean, it's like it's

08:05.720 --> 08:08.680
It's great for a minute but 24 hours a day you're going to lose your mind

08:09.160 --> 08:12.920
You need to zoom out is the bottom line and I've got a bunch of ways that you can do it

08:12.920 --> 08:16.200
I've got to have a folder full of ways that you can actually achieve this which

08:16.760 --> 08:18.760
Up to and including the faith of your youth

08:18.840 --> 08:22.040
But not not exclusively second is family life

08:22.440 --> 08:28.840
Family life is critically important and is woefully neglected and it's societally increasingly neglected as well

08:28.920 --> 08:31.400
Which which is accounts for a lot of this decline

08:32.280 --> 08:37.320
Friendship friendship is actually getting harder and harder to come by we find that more people say nobody knows me well

08:37.560 --> 08:41.640
And last but not least we have more of a dysfunctional relationship with work than we've had in the past

08:41.640 --> 08:45.800
It's less like a vocation. It's less like a mission. Those are the climate factors

08:45.800 --> 08:50.040
I know you're going to want to talk more about specifics in each one of those silos

08:50.360 --> 08:56.760
Then there's the storms the storms have been have created down drafts of happiness from which we have not recovered in

08:57.240 --> 09:01.000
2008 to 2010 it was screens smartphones social media

09:01.400 --> 09:07.240
Especially among young adults. This is we understand the brain science on how this is incredibly deleterious to happiness

09:07.720 --> 09:11.960
Second starting in about 2014 across most OECD countries

09:12.200 --> 09:19.640
But really in the united states and the uk was the was the culture war was the incredibly polarizing ideological conflicts where

09:20.600 --> 09:27.960
Malignantly narcissistic political and media leaders were conscripting child soldiers into their culture war by saying if somebody

09:28.280 --> 09:32.040
Disagrees with you politically. They're denying your right to exist

09:32.680 --> 09:35.400
And you must hate them unbelievably terrible for happiness

09:35.400 --> 09:38.600
And last but not least was the loneliness that came from the coronavirus epidemic

09:39.160 --> 09:41.400
For young adults that were coming of age

09:42.120 --> 09:44.680
Synaptically in the plasticity of their brains

09:45.240 --> 09:50.440
They literally didn't learn how to make friends and and have proper in-person love relationships

09:50.680 --> 09:54.120
Which is probably the worst thing that's happened to happiness in the last hundred years

09:54.760 --> 10:00.600
Why hasn't happiness been so robust that it's bounced back? What has locked in these losses in the market?

10:01.320 --> 10:05.640
Well, if you if I could do one thing for somebody to make them happier one thing

10:06.120 --> 10:07.880
It's eye contact and touch

10:07.880 --> 10:12.440
That's the one thing. Why because you know, the neurophysiology is straightforward. You've talked about this on your show

10:13.160 --> 10:17.320
The the the neuro peptide of connection is oxytocin

10:17.800 --> 10:22.600
It's intensely pleasurable and and again, we don't want to be reductive about the brain chemistry

10:22.600 --> 10:26.840
But this is a really important thing for us to understand. We're a kin based species

10:26.840 --> 10:32.920
We know hours and hours know us and we get pleasure from being close to our kin such that we are averse to

10:33.320 --> 10:35.320
Walking the frozen tundra and dying alone

10:35.880 --> 10:43.160
Okay, that that natural impulse is actually guided in no small part by this neuro peptide that functions as a hormone in the human brain called

10:43.320 --> 10:44.600
Octitocin

10:44.600 --> 10:47.320
We don't get it when we don't have eye contact and touch

10:47.960 --> 10:52.680
How do you not get eye contact and touch by conducting your friendships through an iphone?

10:53.240 --> 10:54.760
with social media

10:54.760 --> 10:59.400
By going to school on zoom by never going into an office man

10:59.480 --> 11:00.760
I mean, it's it's it's crazy

11:00.760 --> 11:04.440
Look, if I were in austin we'd be doing this in person because it would be it would be better

11:04.520 --> 11:09.640
And it would be better because we'd have more eye contact and because we'd be getting more oxytocin over the course of this conversation

11:10.120 --> 11:14.120
Young people who've never gotten that have wired their brains differently

11:14.440 --> 11:19.560
And the result is it's not clear that they're ever going to be able to recover from what we've done

11:20.120 --> 11:23.560
Not I mean, I don't I don't mean to be you know catastrophic about it, but

11:24.440 --> 11:31.320
I'm not entirely convinced that this that we're not losing a generation to oxytocin deficit and lowliness

11:32.520 --> 11:34.520
this

11:34.600 --> 11:36.600
is bad news

11:37.480 --> 11:39.480
predictably for

11:39.480 --> 11:40.120
the

11:40.120 --> 11:42.120
lone ranger sigma male

11:42.440 --> 11:47.880
Guys out there who don't need friends and i'm going to make it on my own and it's too hard to get out there

11:48.040 --> 11:54.840
And I'm just going to retreat myself to my little digital cabin in the woods and not spend any time together

11:55.880 --> 11:57.880
It's one of the reasons why I'm such a

11:58.360 --> 12:00.680
a critic of cynicism on the internet that

12:01.240 --> 12:04.600
Things won't get better and people who say that it can are the problem

12:07.480 --> 12:09.480
It is so

12:09.560 --> 12:13.720
I mean look if you have managed to convince yourself that things aren't going to get better and

12:14.680 --> 12:19.480
You are robust in your thinking and it's not going to change. All right, whatever like I don't want you to

12:20.120 --> 12:24.840
Leave society but so be it but it's fucking evil for you to convince other people

12:25.480 --> 12:30.280
Of the same like you for you to somehow convince other people that no it's not there's no

12:30.840 --> 12:34.680
Point in trying to get into a relationship. There's no point in trying to have friends

12:34.680 --> 12:37.480
There's no point in trying to contribute to society. All right

12:37.480 --> 12:42.600
Well, I mean like all of those things will very reliably make you miserable and you're basically saying

12:43.320 --> 12:48.680
My philosophy is the one to follow despite the fact that we know the direction. It's going to take you in

12:48.680 --> 12:53.400
Yeah, yeah, you know, let me let me let me make sure that I'm not I'm not actually guilty of that

12:54.120 --> 12:56.280
By saying that I'm worried about losing a generation

12:56.600 --> 13:01.880
You can rewire your brain the question is whether or not that you have this is that the society is

13:02.280 --> 13:07.640
Is giving us adequate opportunities to do so and if it isn't take those opportunities yourself

13:07.880 --> 13:10.680
nobody is permanently lost if they actually will will

13:11.640 --> 13:16.760
Will do what actually needs to be done and adopt the attitudes that show that for example

13:17.400 --> 13:21.880
You're better off when you're around people you need real friends

13:22.440 --> 13:24.440
You'll be a lot happier

13:24.440 --> 13:28.920
All the young men listening to modern wisdom if you fall in love and get married and have children

13:29.000 --> 13:34.440
You'll be happier. You'll be a lot happier. It's not true what the red pill community is telling you that you'll be

13:34.840 --> 13:39.240
Subjugated and miserable your whole life. I got the data trust me on this. This is the whole point

13:39.640 --> 13:45.400
I'm worried about losing a generation precisely because the messages are coming out that these things are stupid and don't make sense

13:46.120 --> 13:48.360
That's the wrong set of of messages

13:48.520 --> 13:52.120
I want to be transgressive and counter cultural against the

13:52.600 --> 13:56.840
The technology that's saying that you don't need to be in person and against the culture

13:57.240 --> 14:00.760
That's saying that not being around people is better than being with people

14:01.560 --> 14:03.560
Bravo. Okay, faith

14:04.120 --> 14:05.160
family

14:05.160 --> 14:07.160
Friendships contributing in terms of work

14:07.720 --> 14:08.760
right

14:08.760 --> 14:10.600
faith i'm a

14:10.600 --> 14:11.560
non

14:11.560 --> 14:16.840
Religious person non-believing person right many people listening will be if they don't have a direct

14:17.480 --> 14:19.480
route to access faith

14:19.480 --> 14:22.360
What are some of the highest return strategies they can do?

14:22.920 --> 14:26.200
So remember the point isn't faith per se as transcendence

14:26.600 --> 14:30.200
You need to do something that will make you small and the universe big

14:30.520 --> 14:32.680
That's what that that's what the science really says

14:33.160 --> 14:38.360
And you know in mother nature doesn't want you to do that mother nature is like it's all about you

14:39.080 --> 14:44.200
You are the star of your psychodrama and why because you know that that's you know evolutionarily

14:44.200 --> 14:46.600
It sort of makes sense that you'd be focusing on yourself all the time

14:47.480 --> 14:51.000
But also it's worth pointing out that mother nature doesn't care if you're happy

14:51.800 --> 14:53.800
mother nature

14:54.760 --> 15:01.640
Only cares that you survive and pass on your genes and so therefore happiness. That's that's your problem in your business

15:02.120 --> 15:07.000
That's the key thing for us to keep in mind. I think that's just to interject there. I think that that

15:07.800 --> 15:14.280
Realization that humans are not designed to achieve happiness that that's a state which might be

15:14.920 --> 15:19.000
It's it's neither necessary nor sufficient for you to do what mother nature wanted you to do

15:19.000 --> 15:21.640
It was just it was like a byproduct of it. So

15:22.200 --> 15:24.920
Realizing, you know, it's not like you're swimming upstream

15:25.400 --> 15:28.360
But that most of the set points and motivations

15:29.160 --> 15:30.120
that

15:30.120 --> 15:32.120
Your system will try and push you toward

15:32.680 --> 15:35.320
Are not going to be conducive to happiness

15:35.560 --> 15:40.520
So when the question of why why is it so hard to be happy or why is happiness a big dearth in the modern world?

15:40.680 --> 15:43.480
It's like well, it's been in a big dearth for a very long time

15:43.480 --> 15:48.120
There is no reason for your system to try and encourage you to be happy in the first place

15:48.760 --> 15:52.520
Yeah, that's right and and and to speak in terms that you've often used in your show

15:53.160 --> 15:55.420
That is to be managed by your limbic system

15:56.380 --> 16:01.020
As opposed to actually drawing the experiences of your life into your prefrontal cortex

16:01.420 --> 16:07.500
The c-suite of your brain where you're making decisions that the divine path actually comes from being fully human

16:07.900 --> 16:10.860
The animal path comes from not being fully human

16:11.180 --> 16:15.420
That that leaving these sensations in the emotional centers of the limbic system of your brain would say

16:15.900 --> 16:20.300
Do this because you feel that that's no way to live. That's a really important thing to keep in in mind

16:20.700 --> 16:23.180
Mother nature says you're the star of your psychodrama

16:23.420 --> 16:28.060
You want to be happy? You have to leave that behind and the way to do that is to achieve transcendence from yourself

16:28.540 --> 16:33.980
Here's a really good way to do that. You and I are one of your neighbor out there in austin texas is ryan holiday

16:34.140 --> 16:40.460
Our mutual friend ryan hall of it. He's great. He's the world's leading expert on the modern understanding of the stoic philosophers

16:40.780 --> 16:47.180
He reads senica for fun and epictetus and marcus aurelius and he's talking about wall cicero said

16:47.580 --> 16:51.580
It's just amazing how he does that. Why because he actually wants to achieve transcendence

16:51.980 --> 16:57.500
By doing the hard things that come from the denial of the visceral pleasures that are embedded in the

16:57.980 --> 17:04.540
In the impulses of the limbic system. That's really what stoicism is all about. That's the divine path of transcendence using pure philosophy

17:04.940 --> 17:07.580
Many philosophies will do that. I don't recommend niché

17:08.060 --> 17:13.740
That's what a lot of sort of the modern crowd is is talking about which leads to some of the problems that we were just discussing a minute ago

17:14.140 --> 17:15.980
There are better paths

17:15.980 --> 17:21.580
Some people will actually get this by getting out of their head in a meditative experience using nature

17:21.980 --> 17:24.540
So one of the things that I recommend to a lot of young people today

17:24.620 --> 17:28.300
A lot of young guys coming out of college will call me. Ah, I feel lost

17:28.620 --> 17:30.060
I thought I was going to be

17:30.060 --> 17:34.300
So clear about my life when I got out of college and so what do I do professor?

17:34.700 --> 17:37.820
And one of the things that I often recommend is i'm not going to you know

17:37.820 --> 17:43.740
Tell them to go find some specific faith or sit in the mouth of the cave and talk to the guru or learn how to meditate immediately

17:44.140 --> 17:47.020
What I say is get up an hour and a half before dawn

17:47.580 --> 17:52.620
That's called the brahma muhurta in samskrita. That's that means in samskrita the creator's time

17:53.340 --> 17:59.580
That is a very special time for for the development of your own brain because what you find is if you get up

18:00.140 --> 18:01.980
systematically before sunrise

18:01.980 --> 18:03.980
You're going to be more focused

18:03.980 --> 18:07.980
You'll learn more quickly and your attention will be better throughout the course of the day

18:07.980 --> 18:13.180
There's a lot of research that shows this get out of the house when it's nice and dark and cool

18:14.140 --> 18:17.580
And walk for an hour be ambulatory for an hour

18:18.140 --> 18:21.420
And and such that you're doing it as the sun is coming up by the end of your walk

18:21.660 --> 18:26.540
And you can hear the crunch of the gravel on the trail beneath your feet. You don't have your device

18:26.620 --> 18:31.180
You're not I mean I I strongly recommend listening to modern wisdom not then

18:31.820 --> 18:36.380
That's not when you're listening to your podcast. You're listening to your heartbeat. You're listening to the birds

18:36.460 --> 18:39.660
You're listening to the the sound of the trail in your feet, etc.

18:39.980 --> 18:42.700
This is a very good way to do it. There's a lot of science to back it up

18:43.100 --> 18:46.620
This is not just romanticism another way to do this is to

18:47.260 --> 18:48.700
Is to actually

18:48.700 --> 18:54.620
Stand in awe of great genius. I recommend learning about the fugues of yohan sebastian bach

18:55.100 --> 18:57.260
And listening with utter seriousness

18:57.980 --> 19:02.220
For example to his cantatas. He's got hundreds of them. They fell off his pen

19:02.540 --> 19:06.780
Learn about that. It's just gonna it's gonna blow your mind. You'll be small. Trust me

19:07.260 --> 19:10.620
You could start of a postant of meditation practice. Why not or

19:11.420 --> 19:13.180
I go to mass every day

19:13.180 --> 19:18.300
You can practice your faith and and by the way chris. I understand that you don't have a faith or you know a sense of this

19:18.940 --> 19:24.780
You might after 40 and being open to the impulse to actually find the divine in your life

19:24.860 --> 19:28.060
That's a critically important way to actually practice this as well. Just the openness

19:28.540 --> 19:31.020
I went to my first american

19:31.500 --> 19:33.180
Bible church

19:33.180 --> 19:34.700
service on

19:34.780 --> 19:37.740
Easter Sunday this year and

19:38.860 --> 19:45.580
Boy was that that was an experience. There was a rock band. There was an led wall. There was pyrotechnics

19:46.220 --> 19:48.220
I pulled up behind a

19:48.700 --> 19:50.380
uh

19:50.380 --> 19:56.700
Like super fast american muscle car that had god now as the number plate

19:57.020 --> 20:00.620
So I found that it was very enjoyable and I can totally see why people do it

20:00.620 --> 20:05.260
So I'm absolutely open to I'm open to the potential of that. All right. That's faith family

20:06.220 --> 20:07.980
yeah, so

20:07.980 --> 20:12.300
This should be pretty obvious not everybody by the way has access to

20:12.860 --> 20:17.180
Functional family relationships. I get it and some people actually have to kind of assemble a family

20:17.740 --> 20:21.420
But I'll tell you it's a kind of a funny thing. I mean, I didn't quite understand this until

20:22.060 --> 20:26.620
Later in life and part of the reason is because I had at best kind of a cordial relationship with my parents

20:27.340 --> 20:30.940
It was there's nothing wrong. They were there were good parents, but you know, I was doing my thing

20:30.940 --> 20:37.020
I was living in europe through my 20s. I was I was a professional musician when you were, you know, throwing people out of bars

20:37.180 --> 20:39.180
I was playing in a symphony orchestra

20:39.260 --> 20:43.100
Which is a different lifestyle, but you know it bears certain similarities as well

20:43.180 --> 20:47.500
You know you're out late at night and you're far away from home and you're living your dream and the whole thing

20:47.580 --> 20:49.340
And I can't remember thinking

20:49.340 --> 20:54.700
In my 20s, I should get to know my parents. My mother was an artist. My father was a mathematician

20:54.700 --> 20:57.900
They were very interesting and intellectual and cultured people

20:58.860 --> 21:00.860
And then they died

21:00.860 --> 21:02.060
They just

21:02.060 --> 21:03.660
died young

21:03.660 --> 21:08.780
Now my father was pretty close to my age now and uh, and it was too late and I thought

21:09.900 --> 21:15.020
You know, what does that mean? Does that set me back? And it turns out that I could fix that because now I have adult children

21:15.100 --> 21:17.100
I'm a grandfather at this point

21:17.260 --> 21:20.060
And I talk to all of my kids every single day

21:20.700 --> 21:21.740
I see my grandson

21:21.740 --> 21:23.260
I'm moving

21:23.260 --> 21:26.460
Because my kids are moving and my grandchildren are going to living in a different place

21:26.540 --> 21:29.340
And I'm not going to commute to them is what it comes down to

21:29.980 --> 21:35.980
You must have family relationships or manufacture family relationships in your life and you must not have schism for

21:36.620 --> 21:38.860
Stupidities like differences of political opinion

21:39.340 --> 21:44.220
The narcissists and politics will tell you to stop talking to people in your family because they I don't know voted for

21:44.300 --> 21:46.780
Trump or didn't vote for Trump or whatever the thing is

21:47.500 --> 21:52.540
It's so idiotic that you would sacrifice your own happiness for somebody else's political cult

21:52.860 --> 21:55.180
It's completely nutty is the way that that works out

21:55.420 --> 22:00.300
You need to have it keep it or make it and make it a part of your life that you exercise every day

22:00.860 --> 22:02.860
all right friends

22:02.940 --> 22:07.420
Friendship is should be the easiest because we're all surrounded by people all day long

22:07.980 --> 22:12.780
And it turns out it's the hardest for a lot of people. I'm kind of a striver whisperer in my practice

22:12.940 --> 22:17.180
I specialize in people that really want to make a lot with their lives that are serious about the

22:17.820 --> 22:21.660
Entrepreneurial venture of their own life. They're the startup entrepreneur of me Inc.

22:21.660 --> 22:23.660
I really admire that and it's something that I teach

22:24.220 --> 22:27.900
The problem with that is it's very easy to no longer have real friends

22:28.620 --> 22:34.700
They have deal friends, but not real friends and and real and deal are different deal deal friends. They're useful

22:35.020 --> 22:39.420
They're very useful, right and it's good to have people who are useful to you and it's good to be useful to others

22:39.500 --> 22:40.780
Don't get me wrong

22:40.780 --> 22:43.660
But you need useless friends too people who just love you

22:44.380 --> 22:47.020
You need useless friends. I don't mean worthless friends. I have those too

22:47.340 --> 22:52.700
You need people who who are not useful to you and you're not useful to them

22:53.020 --> 22:57.500
They just love you chris and and we have fewer and fewer of that. That's the reason that

22:58.140 --> 23:01.820
60 percent of 60 year old men today say their best friend is their wives

23:02.220 --> 23:05.180
And 30 percent of their wives say their best friend is their husband

23:05.500 --> 23:12.300
That's a a sad story of unrequited love for men my age. It's really important to keep this in mind

23:12.540 --> 23:16.220
It's also because women seem to be able to hold on to

23:16.780 --> 23:18.780
uh, that allo parenting

23:19.260 --> 23:24.700
Adjacents group of close friends better than men do. I mean, this is one of the reasons why during

23:25.260 --> 23:28.300
divorces men have a worse time of it

23:29.020 --> 23:33.820
For many reasons, but one of them being that they often subjugate their friend group for their wife's friend group

23:34.300 --> 23:37.260
And when the wife goes away the friend group goes away

23:37.820 --> 23:45.580
Yeah, yeah, so for in traditionally organized families in in past times in particular when dad left and and made a living

23:46.140 --> 23:49.740
Outside the home at work. He would be cheating his family by hanging out with his friends

23:50.220 --> 23:56.780
And so he didn't and the result is that he lost his friendship chops over the years and got lonelier and lonelier and lonelier

23:57.180 --> 23:59.180
Now you think it'd be much better now

23:59.180 --> 24:03.260
It's much worse because everybody's doing that now everybody's men are doing that women are doing that

24:03.260 --> 24:08.140
And you find that women and men under 30 are now the loneliest cohort in our society

24:08.300 --> 24:12.940
And the more successful they are in their lives the lonelier they tend to be in their lives

24:13.260 --> 24:15.660
They're more likely to say that nobody knows me well

24:15.740 --> 24:18.860
The reason is real and deal and you got to do the work

24:19.100 --> 24:23.180
I mean for a lot of people they haven't had close friendships since college or from high school

24:23.740 --> 24:29.580
And when they're you know, 28 years old and now 35 years old they're 45 years old and everybody's incredibly useful to them

24:29.900 --> 24:36.140
Now to be sure the the most successful marriages are the ones that are based on on on deep friendship

24:36.300 --> 24:40.220
We call it companion at love which sounds, you know, distinctly not hot

24:40.620 --> 24:45.500
I get it, but it's important because that's the the closest friendship you're going to have but it's not enough

24:46.140 --> 24:49.500
You find that the happiest people they have they're very close friends with their spouse

24:49.580 --> 24:55.740
But they have one really close friend at least besides that introverts usually have one really close friend besides a spouse

24:56.060 --> 24:58.060
Extroverts have more like five

24:58.060 --> 25:01.740
They don't have 20 because you don't have the time to maintain that but it's really important

25:02.460 --> 25:07.100
How often do we need to see our friends? How do we determine whether somebody is real or deal?

25:07.660 --> 25:11.260
What's the amount of time that we need to spend with them per week, etc, etc

25:11.260 --> 25:16.140
Yeah, there's lots of rules for that and again, this falls into the your results may vary category

25:16.220 --> 25:19.580
But there's one thing that I do know when somebody says, oh, yeah, no, no, I mean that's like

25:20.300 --> 25:23.900
I have some real friends. Let's say think about your most real friend who's not your spouse again

25:24.220 --> 25:26.220
When's the last time you talked to him?

25:26.540 --> 25:29.580
I don't know two months ago. Not a real friend. I'm sorry

25:30.140 --> 25:33.820
I'm sorry. I mean, it's like if it's your real friend you keep up to date with your real friends

25:33.820 --> 25:39.340
I have two guys that I talk to every week and they one lives in san francisco and one lives in atlanta

25:39.420 --> 25:40.940
I live in boston

25:40.940 --> 25:44.460
I see them in person. I saw one of them for breakfast yesterday in new york city

25:44.460 --> 25:47.820
We take opportunities with one of them. We go on vacation together with our wives

25:48.460 --> 25:52.620
That's the effort that you make because you you want to see the people you love

25:53.100 --> 25:55.980
You want to see him in person you make the effort you want to talk to him

25:55.980 --> 25:59.660
You miss him you actually miss him if if you don't miss the person

26:00.140 --> 26:03.420
It doesn't kind of hurt your heart because you haven't talked to him in a while in a week

26:03.980 --> 26:08.380
It's not a real friend. What's the difference between real and deal? How can someone tell a lot of the time we

26:09.180 --> 26:14.940
Feel like real friends are also impressive if you're on the personal growth journey. It's difficult to

26:15.580 --> 26:21.820
Distinguish real and deal from real ordeal. Yeah, the difference is that with a deal friend

26:21.980 --> 26:28.380
There's something in front. There's this trend. There's a transaction that's happening. That's more important than the emotion transaction

26:28.460 --> 26:33.180
Trump's emotion. There's nothing wrong with that with people in your life. By the way, it's not like you should

26:33.820 --> 26:38.460
Fire all of your transactional friendships. No because you'll wind up without a career to be sure

26:38.780 --> 26:40.620
It's very good to help each other

26:40.620 --> 26:45.100
But if the emotion that you feel for the person is more important than the transaction you could undertake

26:45.500 --> 26:49.740
Okay, that's good in which case you can actually have deals with your real friends

26:49.980 --> 26:56.620
But that's the key component and if for all of them, it's like I care a lot more about how the person is useful to me

26:56.940 --> 26:59.180
Than the person's life. That's when you know

26:59.740 --> 27:01.740
Got you final one. What?

27:01.820 --> 27:02.940
Yeah

27:02.940 --> 27:05.660
Work is you know, people listening to us right now

27:06.780 --> 27:10.300
They want an edge in their lives and I and I understand that in a way that they

27:10.860 --> 27:17.100
Measure that edge frequently is is in their and their success. You know, I think I probably at first listened to you

27:18.060 --> 27:22.460
Three years ago, maybe the first time I heard your show and I think you just passed

27:23.340 --> 27:25.340
I don't know a hundred thousand

27:25.660 --> 27:30.140
YouTube subscribers or something that was a long time ago because you have a lot more than that right now

27:30.300 --> 27:35.340
And I remember you're like, I can't believe it man and your career was kind of blowing up

27:35.340 --> 27:40.060
I remember thinking that because I was thinking yeah, this young guy is doing great. It's very inspirational

27:40.460 --> 27:44.220
I love people who are in the hunt. I really really love people who are in the hunt

27:44.460 --> 27:46.300
The problem is

27:46.300 --> 27:49.580
That when it comes to work the hunt itself doesn't give you

27:50.140 --> 27:53.980
Doesn't give you the satisfaction that you're going to desire mother nature lies to you in many ways

27:53.980 --> 27:57.980
But and we've talked about it before but but here's one of the biggest lies that mother nature gives you

27:58.380 --> 28:00.380
If you're successful and making

28:00.860 --> 28:06.780
Progress and money and power and the admiration of other people then you'll be happy you get happiness for free

28:07.100 --> 28:09.980
Success first happiness second. So you don't have to worry about happiness

28:09.980 --> 28:11.980
You just have to be successful money power

28:11.980 --> 28:12.700
admiration

28:12.700 --> 28:14.700
Maybe a little pleasure thrown in there along the way

28:15.260 --> 28:18.300
Those are the worldly idols by the way st. Thomas Aquinas

28:18.620 --> 28:23.340
In paraphrasing Aristotle and the Summa Theologia written in 1265

28:23.820 --> 28:27.820
Classified those as the world's idols he was an excellent social scientist

28:28.220 --> 28:32.140
Because it turns out that those are the intermediate good. There's nothing wrong with those things by the way

28:32.140 --> 28:37.340
I'm not condemning those things. They're just incomplete for your happiness if you you have those as the goals

28:37.420 --> 28:41.740
You're in real trouble. Okay. So what are the right goals from work? It's twofold

28:42.300 --> 28:44.800
number one earn your success

28:45.500 --> 28:51.500
That means create value with your life and work in your life in the lives of other people and you have to be rewarded and

28:51.820 --> 28:55.340
Acknowledged and recognized for the the real value that you're creating

28:55.900 --> 29:03.020
10 years nonsense loyalties nonsense merit hard work and personal responsibility and you're rewarded and recognized for it

29:03.020 --> 29:05.020
And you believe it that's earned success

29:05.580 --> 29:09.340
That by the way, that's why I'm a complete advocate for the free enterprise system

29:09.900 --> 29:13.020
Not because I you know, it's like rah rah rah capitalism adam smith

29:13.020 --> 29:13.740
No

29:13.740 --> 29:19.340
Because it makes people happy when they're succeeding in the in the in a system that rewards merit and personal responsibility

29:19.340 --> 29:23.100
It's not perfect, but it's the only system we got that really does that that's number one two

29:23.580 --> 29:25.580
Now i'm going to sound like a commie

29:25.580 --> 29:27.340
service to others

29:27.340 --> 29:32.700
Service to others you need to actually believe actually that's not communism. That's capitalism too. I take it back

29:33.340 --> 29:37.740
Service to others is incredibly it's it's this will bring you joy to your work

29:37.820 --> 29:41.340
You have to know that people need you the essence of human dignity

29:41.820 --> 29:43.580
Is about being needed

29:43.580 --> 29:50.860
Is like feeling it like an asset in society the essence of despair is feeling like a liability to be managed

29:51.020 --> 29:55.340
By your family by the welfare system by anybody else

29:55.420 --> 30:00.540
Which is why it's so terrible to be in poverty because of the way that we treat people in poverty

30:00.540 --> 30:05.740
We don't look at them as assets to develop which they should be because human beings are human beings with equal dignity

30:06.140 --> 30:07.580
We treat them like, you know

30:07.580 --> 30:14.860
Liabilities to manage by the by whatever system that they're they're talking about to create value in the lives of other people to

30:15.420 --> 30:21.020
To to to serve others means that they need you and that is the true secret to everything else

30:21.100 --> 30:23.180
Now you get it like crazy because you know

30:24.060 --> 30:26.940
You don't you don't have gunned anybody's head to listen to modern wisdom

30:27.420 --> 30:33.580
They're coming to you voluntarily and that is this affirmation. They need me. They like it. It's in the comments. Thank you

30:33.740 --> 30:35.180
My guess is you get

30:35.180 --> 30:40.060
20 emails a day from people who say that that podcast really changed my thinking

30:40.540 --> 30:45.820
They need you. Well, everybody needs that every single person needs that whether you're you know picking apples or

30:46.460 --> 30:49.980
You know trying to you know running for congress you actually need that in your life

30:50.300 --> 30:53.820
Those are the two service to others and and earning your success

30:54.700 --> 30:56.700
I had an essay that I wrote

30:57.260 --> 30:58.460
Probably about a year ago now

30:58.460 --> 31:01.740
I want to read it to you about the tension between success and happiness

31:02.220 --> 31:04.540
One of the most tensions one of the most common tensions

31:04.540 --> 31:08.780
I talk about at the moment is between a desire for success and a desire to feel like we're enough

31:09.340 --> 31:10.860
Success is a strange thing

31:10.860 --> 31:16.140
Presumably we want success because we think a more successful life will bring us more happiness meaning and fulfillment

31:16.460 --> 31:18.940
Here's the problem. We sacrifice the thing we want

31:19.340 --> 31:24.140
Happiness for the thing which is supposed to get it success failure can make you miserable

31:24.220 --> 31:27.660
But i'm not sure that success will make you happy one of the most common dynamics

31:27.660 --> 31:30.780
I see amongst high performances is this parents want their child to do well

31:31.180 --> 31:35.260
Parents encourage their child to do well by praising when they succeed and criticizing when they fail

31:35.500 --> 31:39.980
The child learns that praise and admiration is contingent on succeeding this lesson

31:40.540 --> 31:46.060
Metastasizes through early adulthood into I am only worthy of love acceptance and belonging if I succeed

31:46.380 --> 31:48.860
Now powered by an internal feeling of insufficiency

31:49.020 --> 31:51.260
This person is driven to achieve many things

31:51.420 --> 31:56.620
They're prepared to outwork out hustle and out suffer everyone else because they're not just running toward a life that they want

31:56.860 --> 32:01.900
They're running away from a life that they fear success and progress ameliorates the feelings of insufficiency

32:02.140 --> 32:05.740
Therefore success and progress becomes prioritized above everything else

32:05.980 --> 32:10.940
Now don't get me wrong many high performers genuinely love the work that they do and many are driven by a well balanced

32:11.020 --> 32:13.420
simple desire to maximize their time on this planet

32:14.220 --> 32:16.540
Rather than trying to fill a void inside of themselves

32:16.860 --> 32:21.660
But if I was to place a bet I'd guess that the majority of high performers are driven by fears of insufficiency

32:21.900 --> 32:24.220
Rather than a holistic desire to be better

32:24.540 --> 32:28.460
I think people who are high achievers on average are more miserable than the average person

32:28.780 --> 32:33.420
So what does it mean that the people we admire most are the ones with the least admirable internal states?

32:33.820 --> 32:38.140
If the pursuit of success is in an effort to make us happy and in the pursuit of success

32:38.300 --> 32:43.340
We make ourselves miserable. Why not just shortcut the entire process and just be happy?

32:43.820 --> 32:46.620
Is that even possible now external accolades count for a lot?

32:46.700 --> 32:51.820
And I don't think that recanting all worldly possessions and retreating to a cave in the woods is an optimal strategy

32:52.060 --> 32:58.140
Some degree of external material success is important to make us feel validated and satiate our desire for status and respect

32:58.460 --> 33:05.340
But external success will not fill an internal void and insufficiency adaptation is this if your drive

33:06.060 --> 33:10.940
Comes from a fear of insufficiency and you continue to disprove those fears with success in the real world

33:11.180 --> 33:17.340
And yet the feeling of insufficiency persists. What makes you think that the answer to this problem is more success

33:18.620 --> 33:19.900
nice

33:19.900 --> 33:22.780
Very astute you're a natural social scientist

33:23.340 --> 33:25.820
I admire it and it's all true

33:26.060 --> 33:29.500
Look everything is like there's a ton of science that backs all that up, but you don't need it

33:30.060 --> 33:34.460
Everybody knows that that look if you go for the success to get the happiness

33:35.020 --> 33:38.940
You're going to get the success because we'll be unto you if you have the wrong dreams

33:38.940 --> 33:44.380
Your dreams are going to come true if you work hard on them, but you're not going to get to the happiness the right strategy

33:45.260 --> 33:48.860
Is to shoot for greater happiness and then you'll have enough success

33:49.660 --> 33:52.620
Now those words for a guy like you a stranger like you

33:53.180 --> 33:55.180
They give you a little chill don't they?

33:55.660 --> 34:01.500
Because enough success doesn't sound right. No, no, man. I'm not doing this for enough success

34:01.980 --> 34:04.780
I know tons of guys back in high school who have enough success

34:05.500 --> 34:07.500
I don't want that. I want to be

34:07.900 --> 34:10.620
I want to be special chris. I want to be special

34:11.500 --> 34:19.660
How many people with a success addiction, which is the fundamental brain delivered underlying dopamine?

34:21.340 --> 34:26.140
Moderated or mediated addiction which lies behind workaholism by the way

34:26.860 --> 34:30.620
How many of those people have chosen specialness over happiness?

34:31.020 --> 34:35.980
That's what you're talking about any loser can cultivate all these relationships and all these friendships

34:36.300 --> 34:40.380
But not every loser can work as hard as I do and become a navy seal

34:41.020 --> 34:46.380
and do you know 50 pull-ups and and have you know 40 million

34:47.260 --> 34:49.260
Instagram followers. I don't know

34:49.820 --> 34:53.820
If that's specialness and and by the way mother nature is arriving you once again

34:54.220 --> 34:57.980
Mother nature does not care if you're happy, but mother nature wants you to be special

34:58.460 --> 35:03.260
So that you'll be able to survive more easily by having a higher rank in the kin group

35:03.740 --> 35:06.860
And being able to pass on your genes because you'll be the alpha

35:07.820 --> 35:10.940
But that's not what you want. That's actually not even what you want

35:11.020 --> 35:14.140
You're gonna get enough food and you don't want 750 kids

35:14.940 --> 35:22.140
You what you want is a really really good life and you're being driven by these ancient impulses

35:22.300 --> 35:27.660
That's exactly what you're saying and you've walked into a dopaminergic

35:28.220 --> 35:33.020
Moderated and I don't know why I actually had this thing come up on my screen right now. It's fine. It's fine

35:33.580 --> 35:42.220
It's a why we we we walk into a a a success addiction that makes your brain look more or less like a methamphetamine addicts brain

35:43.020 --> 35:45.020
How can people

35:45.340 --> 35:49.340
Learn to unwind and detach themselves from their desire for success

35:49.740 --> 35:55.740
You don't need to unwind your desire for success. You need to understand and manage your desire

35:56.380 --> 35:59.740
That's what we need to do on all these things. You don't need to want different things

36:00.300 --> 36:04.380
You need to manage your wants for these different things. Look, what does that? I don't drink?

36:04.620 --> 36:06.940
I don't drink alcohol. I don't drink alcohol

36:07.100 --> 36:12.300
And the reason I don't drink alcohol is because there's a lot of alcoholism in my family and I drank way too much when I was your age

36:12.700 --> 36:14.700
I drank a lot when I was your age

36:15.340 --> 36:16.620
And so

36:16.620 --> 36:18.620
I stopped

36:18.940 --> 36:22.700
And I stopped a long time ago. I stopped over 20 years ago. I still want alcohol

36:23.180 --> 36:29.420
I'm not going to stop wanting alcohol. What I do is I manage my desire for alcohol through visa v my behavior

36:30.060 --> 36:34.940
That's what we need to do. Look, of course, you're ambitious. Of course, you're driven for tremendous success

36:35.020 --> 36:35.820
That's wonderful

36:35.820 --> 36:43.340
But it can't manage you that that that drive that ambition that that that intense visceral sense that that you'll only

36:43.740 --> 36:47.580
Be special if you have enough success you can't let it manage you is what it comes down to

36:47.580 --> 36:51.100
Of course, you have these desires. By the way, chris, you're going to get married at some point

36:51.420 --> 36:55.740
And and after you're married you're going to look at a woman and she's going to be incredibly beautiful

36:55.900 --> 37:00.380
And you're going to have a sense of natural human desire for her and you're not going to act on it

37:00.700 --> 37:05.740
That's the same thing is true when when you could work the 14th hour instead of spending the first hour with your kids

37:05.980 --> 37:09.740
You're going to make the decision to sublimate that desire and manage it

37:10.540 --> 37:13.820
Yeah, that's interesting. I remember david bus told me this story

37:14.540 --> 37:16.780
That a reader sent in to him

37:17.580 --> 37:20.860
Saying that his book had saved his marriage

37:21.260 --> 37:26.060
Because this guy had been married for a while maybe between five and ten years something like that

37:26.380 --> 37:30.060
and he'd found himself being attracted to other women and

37:30.700 --> 37:39.500
He took that attraction as some sort of sense that his existing relationship was wrong if I was

37:40.300 --> 37:43.820
Fully totally renaissance period besotted with my partner

37:44.140 --> 37:46.940
I wouldn't have eyes for any other woman for the rest of time

37:47.340 --> 37:53.740
And david explained that there is a very very well embedded reward system that men get when they look at

37:54.060 --> 38:01.660
Even a pair of rocks that slightly resemble boobs like you are driven to just like sexualize and look at anything

38:01.740 --> 38:03.260
whether it's like

38:03.260 --> 38:05.260
geological or otherwise and

38:06.220 --> 38:10.460
He said that it sort of liberated me from this sense that I can't

38:11.420 --> 38:16.540
The desire itself is wrong and I must tell myself a story about it. It feels a little bit to me

38:17.340 --> 38:19.340
like this

38:20.140 --> 38:22.940
Line that we have drawn between when I get enough success

38:23.020 --> 38:27.740
I will allow myself to be happy or I will I will have justified happiness happiness will come as a byproduct

38:28.140 --> 38:30.140
Along for the ride with success

38:30.220 --> 38:36.780
That's kind of the same look your desire to continue to chase this thing may not really

38:37.500 --> 38:38.940
Cease all that much

38:38.940 --> 38:42.780
But your choice about whether or not you do work the 14th hour today

38:43.420 --> 38:47.340
Is one of those and it's not just about you know, it's kind of further upstream

38:47.340 --> 38:50.780
I'm going to guess what you need to do is go further upstream than this and think about

38:51.180 --> 38:52.620
How many hours a day do I want to work?

38:52.700 --> 38:56.460
How much work do I need to put on my plate in order for me to need to work those number of hours

38:56.620 --> 39:00.780
Because otherwise what you're going to end up doing is failing at things that you've intended to do

39:01.020 --> 39:06.060
Like if you've put 14 hours of work on your plate, like you kind of need to do it until you no longer need to do it

39:06.540 --> 39:08.860
And that is a more sort of life design

39:09.660 --> 39:11.260
position

39:11.260 --> 39:13.740
That's right. The unfortunate fact is that

39:14.620 --> 39:20.540
You won't know how to do anything else once you become hopelessly addicted because these behavioral patterns feed on themselves

39:20.620 --> 39:23.580
Notwithstanding the fact that you're getting unhappier and unhappier

39:24.460 --> 39:27.820
Furthermore, there's one other thing that's keep that's worth pointing out if you were

39:28.540 --> 39:31.180
An you know an untreated alcoholic

39:31.740 --> 39:37.500
Nobody would say like dude last night you put away two bottles of vodka. That was impressive

39:37.820 --> 39:43.500
I admire you for that. They'd be like get some help man. That was it's pathetic

39:43.820 --> 39:47.820
But if you work 14 hour days, they're going to be like man, you're going to be the next Elon Musk

39:48.380 --> 39:50.380
What do you admire about Elon Musk?

39:50.380 --> 39:51.900
He works all the time

39:51.900 --> 39:57.740
He and you know people will admire the fact that he says I haven't taken a day off since 2008 or something like that

39:58.060 --> 40:04.140
We love workaholics in our culture. We love success addicts. We love people who are

40:04.780 --> 40:09.580
Self-objectifiers, but let's just think about that a little bit. I mean, I bet when you were a kid

40:09.580 --> 40:11.580
Did you have a good relationship with your dad?

40:11.900 --> 40:13.260
Yeah, not bad

40:13.260 --> 40:16.220
And I bet that he said that you shouldn't objectify women

40:16.380 --> 40:22.380
You shouldn't look at them and say that they're nothing more than sex objects or that you should treat them like real people, right?

40:22.780 --> 40:23.980
you know

40:23.980 --> 40:29.980
Why because you you're a boy and you have an impulse to not do that for all the reasons that david buss has made very clear on your show

40:30.860 --> 40:36.940
Okay, well, you shouldn't objectify yourself either chris and and a self-objectifier is somebody who looks in the mirror and says

40:37.420 --> 40:39.420
That's a success machine

40:39.740 --> 40:41.740
That's somebody and you know that these

40:41.820 --> 40:48.140
Affirmations it'd be like looking in the mirror and saying that's somebody who can say stay stoned all day

40:49.100 --> 40:51.020
It wouldn't do that. That'd be pathetic. It could be weird

40:51.020 --> 40:55.420
And yet that's kind of the thing that we do with the self-objectification which is downstream from success addiction

40:55.500 --> 40:57.500
Which actually is related to workaholism

40:57.900 --> 41:03.180
Which all these weird patterns of behavior that we establish often before even before adolescence

41:03.740 --> 41:08.300
All right, let's get into the macro nutrients the component parts of happiness

41:08.300 --> 41:15.100
We've got three to go through one other. Yeah enjoyment satisfaction and meaning and they seem self-evident, but they're not

41:15.660 --> 41:19.660
The that to be I'll give you an example enjoyment sounds like pleasure

41:19.660 --> 41:22.780
But it's completely different for all the reasons that we've kind of discussed

41:23.340 --> 41:25.340
pleasure is a limbic phenomenon

41:25.580 --> 41:27.580
pleasure is uh is uh

41:27.900 --> 41:35.180
And it's a set of signals in your limbic system saying that something is either really good for helping you survive to get calories

41:35.180 --> 41:38.220
Are really good for getting mates and passing on your genes

41:38.540 --> 41:42.700
That's really the and and we become ingenious at in the laboratory

41:43.260 --> 41:49.100
Creating new ways to get those sensations. So, you know, everything from gambling to pornography to

41:49.740 --> 41:51.740
methamphetamine to

41:51.980 --> 41:58.860
Fentanyl to alcohol all these things do is they mimic different ways that in the place to seem before we had substances in these behaviors

41:59.020 --> 42:02.540
That we would get pleasure from something that actually helps us survive and pass on our genes

42:02.940 --> 42:07.820
Unfortunately, all those things that I just mentioned are addictive and bad for you because

42:08.300 --> 42:11.580
You know, what you're doing is you're artificially stimulating something you don't need to do

42:11.740 --> 42:16.300
And in a way that your your body and brain are not accustomed to and so they're incredibly unhealthy

42:16.540 --> 42:19.580
A lot of guys, especially your age, don't realize how dangerous

42:20.220 --> 42:24.940
Is for the brain for example, but what it is is just it fires up that impulse to pass on your genes

42:25.420 --> 42:31.820
In an artificial way. Okay. So why do I bring that up? Because all those limbic searches for pleasure are different than enjoyment

42:31.900 --> 42:35.340
Which is fundamentally an experience in the prefrontal cortex of your brain

42:36.060 --> 42:40.140
And you don't have to not have pleasure by the way. I'm not I'm I'm catholic. I'm not I'm not a puritan

42:40.940 --> 42:45.500
And what you need is the source of pleasure plus people plus memory

42:45.980 --> 42:51.500
Thus delivering the experience into your prefrontal cortex, which is part of happiness. So I'll give you an example

42:52.300 --> 42:56.460
I was doing work with a big beer company and we were talking about these ideas and I said look

42:57.100 --> 43:00.140
Associate your product with enjoyment not pleasure

43:00.620 --> 43:06.460
And I said, what do you mean? Well, don't run a commercial of a dude alone in his apartment pounding a 12 pack

43:07.340 --> 43:13.420
Why because that's the pursuit of pleasure and everybody knows is addictive and dangerous and irresponsible and pathetic

43:14.380 --> 43:17.900
Do the ad where the guy is having a beer with his brother or his friends

43:18.140 --> 43:23.260
You've taken beer plus people plus memory and that equals enjoyment and that's part of happiness

43:23.580 --> 43:29.420
If you're doing something as pleasurable and and it can be addictive and you're doing it alone. You're probably doing it wrong

43:30.220 --> 43:33.980
That's where pornography comes in. That's where gambling by yourself comes in

43:34.140 --> 43:36.940
That's where eating a whole cake by yourself comes in

43:37.340 --> 43:41.420
That's where using what drinking alone comes in all of these particular behaviors

43:41.500 --> 43:48.620
And that's an example of how the the neuroscience of this can be intensely practical in helping you to lead a better life and change your habits

43:49.180 --> 43:52.700
What else is there to say about the

43:53.900 --> 43:55.660
way to use

43:55.660 --> 44:03.180
Pleasure people and memories is there something you should do to embed memories more effectively other types of pleasures that seem to be better for

44:03.180 --> 44:07.100
Happiness or not other types of people. Is there a way that you can reinforce this?

44:07.100 --> 44:11.900
Do I need an ebbing house forgetting curve flash card anky deck to be able to remember all of the shit that I did?

44:12.460 --> 44:15.100
I mean, hey man, let's make it. Let's make some money. So

44:15.820 --> 44:23.420
I mean, see you're such a natural entrepreneur. It's it's unbelievable. You go write your product. It's great. Um, yeah, the people shouldn't be addicts

44:24.060 --> 44:29.980
You know, it's not going to be helpful to you if your community of people who help you enjoy things that are pleasurable are also drunks

44:30.620 --> 44:36.540
So so it's obviously the case that you want people who are trying to enjoy each other's company as opposed to simply focusing on the

44:36.940 --> 44:41.100
The source of the pleasure the the chemical or behavioral source of the pleasure. That's really important

44:41.900 --> 44:47.580
Actually just to interject that I wonder whether I wonder whether there's an analogy to be drawn between

44:48.940 --> 44:53.100
Um, let's say that you know a bunch of people in a crack den all of whom are just smoking crack

44:53.100 --> 44:57.340
And the only reason that they're there is to like be around other people that also do crack

44:57.340 --> 45:00.380
That's just the environment that they they exist in. I wonder whether

45:01.100 --> 45:04.780
There is kind of an equivalent if you were to let's say be

45:05.740 --> 45:12.140
A professional athlete of some kind training in a facility with a bunch of other individual athletes

45:12.380 --> 45:17.980
But all of whom were only there because they also needed to use the facility individually that they were there for the

45:18.380 --> 45:21.020
personal pursuit now, obviously the pursuit of

45:21.500 --> 45:25.100
training versus the sort of direct pleasure that you get from taking drugs

45:25.420 --> 45:27.340
but my point being that

45:27.340 --> 45:28.460
there's

45:28.460 --> 45:29.900
a lack of

45:29.900 --> 45:35.900
Interaction between each of those individuals. They're very much siloed within their own experience of whatever the pleasure might be

45:36.700 --> 45:38.700
You are at a gaming a games

45:40.620 --> 45:42.700
Place where tons of people can play call of duty

45:42.860 --> 45:46.140
But none of you are playing against each other and none of you are speaking to each other

45:46.620 --> 45:49.660
Right like you're with people. It's doing it in community

45:50.380 --> 45:51.740
But it's not

45:51.740 --> 45:56.060
Integrating with the people. Yeah interaction is critically important. You're not with other people

45:56.300 --> 45:59.100
You're not actually with other people if you're just

45:59.740 --> 46:01.740
In a crowd. I mean you can feel unbelievably

46:02.540 --> 46:07.100
Lonely walking down the street in New York City. You're technically all walking down the street in New York City

46:07.180 --> 46:09.660
This is with little kids. You'll see this when you have children

46:10.460 --> 46:14.220
Before they learn how to interact with each other they do they do something called parallel play

46:14.780 --> 46:19.020
Where you'll bring two little kids two little two year olds together and they'll be playing with blocks

46:19.100 --> 46:23.020
But not together parallel like they want to be looking at each other's way that that works

46:23.340 --> 46:25.340
That doesn't stimulate oxytocin

46:25.980 --> 46:29.500
And so if you want to get into the neurochemistry of what we're talking about here

46:30.060 --> 46:36.700
You're not going to get the benefit of pleasure plus people plus memory unless you're doing something that really stimulates oxytocin

46:36.780 --> 46:40.540
Which means intense interaction eye contact and ideally human touch as well

46:41.100 --> 46:43.100
Right. Okay. So this is an argument to

46:43.980 --> 46:44.940
You know

46:44.940 --> 46:48.860
Give your friends a hug when they just win at a board game to like reach up a high five

46:49.180 --> 46:54.140
I play a lot of werewolves. Have you played werewolves? No, I haven't okay. So werewolves is like a

46:54.780 --> 46:59.340
It's a role-playing card game where everybody in a circle is given a particular character

46:59.660 --> 47:04.460
Some are good guys some are bad guys and you don't know who's who and you have to bluff your way through

47:05.020 --> 47:10.300
The game and oh, I thought about that. Yeah. Yeah, there's another game called mafia, which is basically the same but with different characters

47:10.860 --> 47:12.860
and I have observed

47:13.340 --> 47:15.340
People that have been married for 15 years

47:15.740 --> 47:21.100
Where they completely straight face just lie to their partner about what their role is. No, of course not, honey

47:21.180 --> 47:26.860
I love you. I would like so we've had to make a rule that like what happens during werewolves stays during werewolves

47:27.100 --> 47:32.060
Because the potential blast radius of sort of the loss of the loss of certainty

47:32.700 --> 47:36.620
Lots of trust. Yeah, exactly. There's a lot of uh, I play with a lot of like

47:37.260 --> 47:41.660
World-class pro poker players too, which is just like a kind of to be honest an unfair fight

47:41.820 --> 47:44.140
My point being that with that as soon as the game's finished

47:44.460 --> 47:46.460
Everybody gets up everybody's sort of high five

47:46.460 --> 47:48.220
There's been a ton of tension for a long time

47:48.300 --> 47:50.540
Some people have been working together some people have been working against them

47:50.540 --> 47:54.940
But they've been working together too and everybody's sort of high-fiving and all the rest of it and it's very enjoyable

47:55.260 --> 48:00.060
Um, what is there to say just to round this out? What is there to say about memories?

48:00.540 --> 48:06.060
Um, what can we do to maximize the yield of memories when it comes to enjoyment?

48:07.020 --> 48:10.540
The key thing is actually to do something that's not part of your ordinary routine

48:11.020 --> 48:13.020
The more that you'll actually

48:13.020 --> 48:18.860
Disequilibrate your experience around for example a particular occasion or in a particular place

48:19.340 --> 48:24.220
That will add to the memory such that it will be easier to recall to put together and to recall

48:24.620 --> 48:28.780
And you'll be able to do it to to to to recreate that enjoyment again and again and again

48:28.780 --> 48:35.340
What you'll want is to do something where the experience doesn't stop at the end of the action

48:35.980 --> 48:39.340
That's what you really want. What do you mean when you say disequilibriate?

48:40.060 --> 48:43.580
Disequilibrate what your ordinary routine is so so you'll notice that

48:44.220 --> 48:48.140
The things that you do every single day you don't remember them the things you don't do every single day

48:48.220 --> 48:54.380
You remember them and that's how you the recall so you can have the duration of the experience be richer and longer

48:54.620 --> 49:00.220
To do is to you know when you're going to hang out with your friends go someplace with your friends right as opposed to

49:00.380 --> 49:02.140
Is this a degree of novelty?

49:02.140 --> 49:06.540
Yeah, and that's one of the reasons that I recommend that couples for example leave the house

49:07.100 --> 49:13.260
That they do things together outside of the house. So they're not you know, they don't get into too much of a domestic routine, which is a very

49:14.460 --> 49:21.500
Un a sort of uninteresting way to run your marriage is to do the same thing over and over and over and over again

49:21.500 --> 49:24.300
You're just not going to get the benefits of enjoyment in the same way

49:24.940 --> 49:30.940
I had uh, Susanna Hallinan on the show forever ever ever ago. Now remember she had this really great book

49:31.500 --> 49:34.780
Uh talking about how to make time move more slowly

49:35.340 --> 49:37.820
Yeah, it was so fascinating and it seems to me

49:38.620 --> 49:43.580
At least my current sort of conception of it, which may need to be updated now is novelty and intensity

49:43.820 --> 49:49.100
Those seem to be two of the things that increase the frequency of memory blocks sort of being dropped in that you know

49:49.980 --> 49:56.300
Someone that's listening has driven to work a thousand times. That's a thousand journeys, but it was always the same route

49:56.620 --> 49:58.620
so you have condensed a thousand

49:59.420 --> 50:04.620
15 minute half hour blocks down into essentially one memory apart from that one time that there was a car crash

50:04.620 --> 50:08.220
next to me and it was different because novelty and intensity and um,

50:08.780 --> 50:10.460
yeah, I think just trying to

50:10.460 --> 50:12.220
Keep that in mind to you know

50:12.220 --> 50:18.380
Turn left instead of turning right when you go to the shops to go to a different restaurant to travel to a different hotel to do the whatever

50:18.700 --> 50:20.700
Um, I think important

50:21.260 --> 50:25.100
It is important and and there's a lot of ways that you can do that my wife and I have tried to do that

50:25.100 --> 50:27.100
We've moved 20 times

50:27.260 --> 50:32.860
In the 35 years that we've been together, uh, I mean we I mean it sounds like we're in the witness protection program

50:32.860 --> 50:37.180
I realized but it's part of it is just because when we decide that we want to do a new thing

50:37.180 --> 50:42.140
We do a new thing we've moved three times in the past five years because you know, where do we want to live not here?

50:42.300 --> 50:43.820
I try that

50:43.820 --> 50:48.540
And and this this it's not a search for novel it can become a pathology to be sure

50:48.700 --> 50:50.700
You know, you actually can't stop any place

50:50.940 --> 50:53.580
But the whole idea that you can live in a new way

50:53.980 --> 50:57.500
Try a new thing and not letting it turn into kind of a groove

50:57.500 --> 51:04.460
One of the reasons that the perception of time speeding up happens as people get older is because their openness to experience starts to decline

51:04.460 --> 51:08.940
particularly after 55 your openness to experience increases

51:09.420 --> 51:14.300
Um through your teenage years into your early 20s and it stays relatively constant until your mid 50s

51:14.300 --> 51:17.180
And then it really takes a big dip as a as a matter of this

51:17.820 --> 51:23.660
The way that we typically measured it and what we see your love of new things starts to decline you you got to fight against that

51:23.820 --> 51:25.820
If you want if you don't want time to go

51:26.060 --> 51:30.940
Terrifyingly fast and and and suddenly life is over one of the best ways to do it as you

51:31.420 --> 51:34.060
Correctly point out is to inject more more

51:34.380 --> 51:38.140
You know newness of the ways that you do things in your life and to do that with your partner as well

51:38.780 --> 51:40.780
All right satisfaction. Yeah

51:41.020 --> 51:46.620
Satisfaction is a weird one. So satisfaction is you know, we talk about it all the time, you know

51:47.180 --> 51:51.180
But we don't really define it satisfaction is the joy that you get after struggle

51:52.140 --> 51:56.700
And this is the weird human mystery only humans want pain

51:57.260 --> 52:01.900
We only humans want to sacrifice and struggle because then the rewards are sweeter

52:02.300 --> 52:05.900
The more you struggle before the more and and everybody kind of knows that's true

52:06.060 --> 52:10.780
And yet we don't follow through on that very often. We're always looking for the easy way out

52:10.860 --> 52:12.860
That's the reason that there's this kind of this

52:12.940 --> 52:16.220
Call of the wild that people have when they listen to people like david goggins

52:16.780 --> 52:22.940
Or jack-o-willingke because they're whole or rich role, you know, these are all mutual friends of ours, obviously

52:23.100 --> 52:28.860
And it's like the the the thing that's kind of calling from nature to people when they hear this and they find it so attractive

52:28.940 --> 52:31.260
It's like, yeah, yeah, man. I need more pain

52:31.660 --> 52:37.340
I need more pain in my life because then my life will be sweeter and yet they're going through life trying to find the

52:37.340 --> 52:39.340
Easiest way out. This is a real mystery

52:40.060 --> 52:43.500
Actually, it's not, you know the divine path requires struggle

52:44.140 --> 52:49.420
And the animal path wants convenience and ease and a complete lack of pain

52:49.500 --> 52:51.500
It wants sort of an analgesic existence

52:52.140 --> 52:57.340
So one of the things that we do is we try to teach our kids this, you know, when your kids are little you say

52:58.380 --> 52:59.900
Don't eat before dinner

52:59.900 --> 53:05.580
All parents say this and the and the kid is always like why and you make up a bogus

53:06.220 --> 53:11.180
Excuse like it's bad for you. You know, you're not going to get your proper nutrients. It's all nonsense

53:11.580 --> 53:16.780
You don't want your kid to eat before dinner because you want your kid to be suffering a little bit of hunger before dinner

53:16.780 --> 53:20.220
So they'll enjoy their dinner and be happier. That's what you actually want

53:20.460 --> 53:23.420
But you can't quite articulate it and you don't want to tell the kid

53:23.500 --> 53:26.460
It's because I want you to suffer you want the kid to suffer

53:27.180 --> 53:30.460
And so that's an important thing to keep in mind and that's a real conundrum

53:30.460 --> 53:34.060
And the the more that we can understand that the more that we can expose ourselves to

53:34.540 --> 53:36.540
Suffering for the right reasons

53:36.540 --> 53:42.220
You really should get up before you're ready and while it's still dark. It's best for you to do that

53:42.780 --> 53:45.580
You should work out in the morning. It's a good thing to do

53:45.980 --> 53:47.660
I mean, I get it not everybody can do that

53:47.660 --> 53:52.460
You should do these things that actually hurt and your day will be better and your life will be happier

53:52.620 --> 53:57.740
That's the first mystery is you know trying to sort that the second mystery however is bigger

53:58.300 --> 54:03.580
In satisfaction, which is that mother nature tells us that if we get that thing like that millions

54:04.380 --> 54:10.700
YouTube subscriber, you're gonna love that forever. How long did you enjoy that like half an hour five minutes?

54:11.580 --> 54:13.980
Yeah, that's pretty good. All right five minutes, right?

54:13.980 --> 54:18.140
And but but your brain told you the whole way that when you got that it was going to be awesome

54:18.620 --> 54:22.060
You know, so so Mick Jagger saying I can't get no satisfaction. That's wrong

54:22.620 --> 54:25.900
You wouldn't try and try and try and try if you couldn't get no satisfaction

54:26.220 --> 54:28.220
You can't keep no satisfaction

54:28.700 --> 54:31.740
That's the real problem and you try and you try and you try and that's what

54:32.220 --> 54:34.860
The reason for that is what neuroscientists call homeostasis

54:35.340 --> 54:41.420
Which of course you know about and homeostasis is the tendency of any physiological system to go back to its baseline

54:41.580 --> 54:47.180
So you're ready for the next set of circumstances. It's true for your emotions. It's awesome. It's awesome

54:47.500 --> 54:51.820
Forget it. I got to go back so that I'm not distracted from then so I can stay in the hunt

54:52.380 --> 54:55.180
Is what it comes down to otherwise I'd start to death after I got food

54:55.260 --> 54:58.620
You know be like I was good enough and then you die and you don't want that

54:59.180 --> 55:05.260
So that's the key thing and we the mystery is that really smart sophisticated people never figure that out

55:05.580 --> 55:09.900
And they conclude that they just didn't have enough and this gets back to your success problem

55:10.380 --> 55:16.220
This gets back to the success conundrum. It's like, yeah, I got that thing, but I'm still not satisfied

55:16.460 --> 55:20.620
So I guess I needed five million. I guess I needed 50 million

55:21.180 --> 55:25.020
The first thing that a billionaire concludes is that he needed another billion

55:25.420 --> 55:30.460
Have you seen have you seen that study where when pretty much anybody is asked

55:31.100 --> 55:33.660
What level of wealth would you be satisfied with?

55:34.140 --> 55:37.260
It doesn't matter what level of wealth you're at. It tends to be almost

55:37.900 --> 55:42.780
Exactly three times your current income. It's like at about three times where I'm at now

55:43.500 --> 55:47.260
That's that's my sort of settling point, but it scales all the way up to a billion

55:47.820 --> 55:51.660
Yeah, yeah, there are different studies that one of the studies. I mean some studies say is 40 percent

55:51.820 --> 55:54.540
Some studies say is 300 percent the bottom line is more

55:55.260 --> 56:00.780
Because that's what your brain is telling you that the secret to satisfaction that endures is more

56:01.580 --> 56:07.260
More what more money more power more pleasure more honor more instagram followers more sexual partners more more

56:08.060 --> 56:11.820
And and the problem with that is that it doesn't recognize that there's

56:12.460 --> 56:19.020
A divine version of that that actually works. There's a what I did it again. I keep getting these weird effects on my camera

56:20.060 --> 56:22.060
That there is a way to hack this

56:22.620 --> 56:26.860
This this neuro physiological matrix this evolutionary matrix

56:27.260 --> 56:31.580
And the way to think about this so that you're not subject to this you can be free forever, by the way

56:32.140 --> 56:37.740
Is by remembering the satisfaction that endures is actually a function of all the things you have

56:38.300 --> 56:40.300
Divided by the things that you want

56:40.940 --> 56:43.340
haves divided by wants is the right

56:43.980 --> 56:48.380
Mental model for you to pursue and that means of course you have a have more strategy

56:48.460 --> 56:51.420
Of course you do you also need a want less strategy

56:51.820 --> 56:55.100
You need to manage your wants just as much as you need to manage your haves

56:55.100 --> 56:58.620
I realize that's very Buddhist, but it's actually in every spiritual and philosophical tradition

56:59.100 --> 57:03.820
And so the way that I do that the couple of ways to do that one one way to think about that is to think about the metaphor

57:04.540 --> 57:10.060
The metaphor of success for entrepreneurs is kind of like you're an artist and and you're putting

57:11.180 --> 57:13.180
Brushstrokes on a canvas of your life

57:13.660 --> 57:18.460
The right metaphor is is at some point in your life at least is actually the sculptor

57:19.020 --> 57:26.380
Where you're chipping away the jade or the marble to find the true work of art within and that means getting rid of the detritus

57:26.860 --> 57:30.380
The part of the block of marble that's not the horse or the rider

57:30.860 --> 57:35.500
So that you can find the horse and rider inside and one way to do that that I often do

57:36.220 --> 57:41.340
Is like I used to have a bucket list everybody who listens to this podcast those little bucket lists

57:41.420 --> 57:43.420
I have a reverse bucket list now

57:43.660 --> 57:49.020
Where I take my worldly cravings and desires and ambitions, which I still have I'm turning 60 in two weeks

57:49.340 --> 57:51.340
And I still have the these dumb

57:52.060 --> 57:56.380
You know at this craven trivial desires. I'm a weak weak man

57:57.020 --> 58:01.020
But I'm I actually will write them down on my birthday and I will cross them out

58:01.740 --> 58:02.860
Not because I'm not going to get them

58:02.860 --> 58:09.580
But because I want the management of those cravings and desires to be in my prefrontal cortex and not in my limbic system

58:09.900 --> 58:17.020
Can you give us some examples of of what you cross out? Yeah, so one of the things will be for example these worldly

58:17.900 --> 58:21.100
Metrics of success in my particular industry that are trivial

58:21.420 --> 58:25.420
So for you, it would be a certain number of of youtube subscribers for me

58:25.500 --> 58:28.060
It would be a certain number of

58:28.780 --> 58:30.780
sales of my latest book or

58:31.340 --> 58:34.460
Or prestige inside the university or whatever it happens to be

58:35.100 --> 58:37.100
Now and I realize I know

58:37.420 --> 58:41.660
You know, I I authentically know as do you that these things are trivial

58:41.980 --> 58:45.900
And yet we we look at them as a marker of our own specialness and our own

58:46.700 --> 58:49.420
Sense of accomplishment when I write them down

58:49.500 --> 58:52.700
I acknowledge that I have the desire when I cross it out

58:52.860 --> 58:57.260
I say I I have the desire, but I will not be attached to this goal

58:57.900 --> 59:02.060
That you're you're you're physically negating the attachment from the goal

59:02.700 --> 59:05.180
That I mean, of course the attachment on understanding, you know

59:05.260 --> 59:11.180
Ducca is that concept to the first noble truth of Buddhism that life is suffering because of ducca because of this

59:11.500 --> 59:15.740
Sticky craving for the inadequate things, but it is not saying I'm not going to do that

59:15.820 --> 59:19.340
I'm not going to get that it's saying that I'm not going to be attached to that and it's incredible

59:19.580 --> 59:21.580
This year on my birthday by the way

59:21.580 --> 59:23.740
I got a big one coming man with a zero

59:24.940 --> 59:30.380
My attachment that's bothering me right now. I'm going to admit it. I have too many political opinions

59:30.860 --> 59:32.540
I really do

59:32.540 --> 59:35.660
They're they're weighing me down. They're they're making it harder to have friends

59:36.460 --> 59:41.500
Then they should be so I'm going to write down my 10 strongest political opinions and I'm going to cross them out

59:42.060 --> 59:46.700
Not that I'm saying that I don't believe these things, but I'm not going to be attached to my rightness

59:47.660 --> 59:50.940
That humility is going to set me free and that's a kind of a metaphor

59:51.340 --> 59:53.900
Tick not ha on the great vietnamese buddhist monk

59:54.540 --> 59:57.820
He wrote that our greatest attachments are to our opinions

59:58.380 --> 01:00:00.780
And that's you know triply true for me right now

01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:05.580
So man, I I need freedom and and I'm going to get it by by talking about

01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:08.380
the wants that's just a house

01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:10.300
that

01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:14.300
Practice the exercise of writing down the things that you want and then crossing them out

01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:19.740
Sounds great symbolically. Lovely the writing the physical writing of something lovely

01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:25.180
Presumably that's not just a master key that downstream from that and yes, I'm still going to have it

01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:27.420
But where are you going in your mind?

01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:34.540
Is there a practice which is more repeatable and robust that when your desire to correct somebody about their view on abortion?

01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:37.020
arises that

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:41.100
What where are you going to there to permanently be crossing it out?

01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:46.220
You know what it does is it makes you remember the attachment in the moment of behavior

01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:50.940
That's what that thing does. That's what the important thing is because when it's in your prefrontal cortex

01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:53.260
then it's not

01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:58.940
Then it's a behavior that is that is manageable in in the executive centers of your brain

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:01.500
And so what will you do instead?

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:06.700
When somebody sits down next to me and says something that I really just I don't believe about abortion

01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:09.900
And I think that I think now I have my opportunity

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:12.300
Because my prefrontal cortex is managing and I say

01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:15.180
Tell me why you think that

01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:17.260
Would you please tell me why you think that?

01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:20.780
And and you listen to learn it's an extraordinary thing

01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:25.980
And by the way, you get smarter and you're wrong less often and you get less embarrassed and you lose fewer friends

01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:28.620
And and when you do that the other person that you're talking to

01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:35.340
I just gave a long lecture on the on the on the neuroscience of the absorption of messages and political communications

01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:36.540
that I just get a lecture today

01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:41.100
And one of the things that you find is the more that you do that the more people think that you're that that you're a

01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:44.860
Very smart person who makes very good points and that your point of view is actually quite persuasive

01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:48.540
To shocker how that happens

01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:53.340
Can you you mentioned earlier on something I've heard you talk about before to do with the common idols?

01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:57.340
That uh, people kind of get waylaid by can you just go through this?

01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:03.260
Yeah, that was we mentioned that just a minute ago. That was the Aquinas four idols money power pleasure fame

01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:08.220
money power pleasure fame now Aquinas asserted this is 1265 you didn't have data

01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:12.140
But man he was the best and Aquinas said

01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:18.460
That everybody falls prey to one of these things more than anything else that this is an exhaustive list

01:02:19.180 --> 01:02:22.940
Of the things we care about the most now money is pretty obvious money or wealth it or you know

01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:24.940
financial resources

01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:30.780
Anything that actually allows you to buy stuff and shows that you're a very important person, you know that these markers these

01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:33.900
um medium of exchange and store of value

01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:41.180
The second is pleasure we've talked about and or power power is is the ability to control the behavior of others

01:02:41.260 --> 01:02:45.900
And the last is actually a really kind of a you know a lot of people listening to us are like I don't care about fame

01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:48.460
You know, I don't want to be instagram famous, but that's not it

01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:52.460
It's really the prestige and the admiration of the right people

01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:56.460
I mean if you can be completely screwed up if you were on the disney channel as a kid

01:02:56.860 --> 01:03:03.740
And what you want is the admiration of strangers and they're literally people's brains who are wired like that because they got famous before they were

01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:09.180
While their brain was still in formation and they'll be like somebody who got addicted to methamphetamine as a 14 year old

01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:11.900
They'll they'll never be normal is what we actually know

01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:19.500
But but most aren't like that, but they still want to be considered somebody for the people whose whose opinions actually matter

01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:23.180
Those are the four idols and I play a game with my students

01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:26.620
What's my idol because once you know your idol

01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:30.940
You can actually control your behavior and manage yourself in a much more effective way

01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:33.580
You have to know your weakness is the way that this works out and a lot of people

01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:36.940
It actually don't so do you want to play the game chris hit me you want to play?

01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:39.500
What's my idol? Okay. I'm right the way to play

01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:44.540
What's my idol is not for me to say what which of the four really controls you

01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:49.340
Is to say which of the four do you not care about and start eliminating them?

01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:54.460
Because then we're going to wind up on the one that's really harder for you. So money

01:03:55.180 --> 01:03:56.220
power

01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:57.580
pleasure

01:03:57.580 --> 01:03:58.860
honor

01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:01.900
You got to give away one. Which one are you going to give away power?

01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:04.380
how come

01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:06.220
I

01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:10.220
Don't notice in myself a desire to really accumulate power of any kind

01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:13.260
Okay, so I'm going to make a prediction about you

01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:16.620
You hate it when people have power over you. Oh, yeah

01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:18.700
That's it

01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:24.060
People who hate having people having power over them are averse to having power over other people as well

01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:28.940
You're a non hierarchical person. You're a non hierarchical guy, right?

01:04:29.180 --> 01:04:33.180
Yeah, the the org structure of the business would suggest that as well. Yeah

01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:37.340
Yeah, that's it's and that's almost always the case. Okay. Good. So now we've got money

01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:39.100
pleasure

01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:41.660
And fame or honor or prestige average

01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:44.940
You got to give another one away and it's harder now. What are you going to give away next?

01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:47.740
Uh money

01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:50.300
Money how come

01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:54.140
One of the of all of the different mental pathologies that I have

01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:57.180
materialism

01:04:57.180 --> 01:04:59.180
a desire for sort of

01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:05.100
Flashness in terms of possessions is just not something that I have. I have a degree of scarcity mindset

01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:07.660
which

01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:13.660
A abundance kind of ameliorates, but for me, it's just it's it's not something that I really think about very much

01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:16.140
Did you grow up with nice things?

01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:21.900
We were like lower working class. I think okay lower middle class kind of like lower working class

01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:26.220
Oh lower working class. Okay. Like my wife grew up in Barcelona. So it was you know

01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:30.460
Sometimes you paid the light bill and sometimes you didn't pay the light bill. Okay. You didn't grow up with nice things

01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:33.260
This might be the case now when it comes to this

01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:40.620
There's a very interesting set of sociological theories that you can never be actually comfortable more than one and a half classes

01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:42.780
Above that in which you were a child

01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:46.780
So if you were if you were kind of lower working class that means that

01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:52.700
The tastes above upper middle class are going to be like that stuff is boring, man

01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:58.300
That's that it's like you want me to collect art. Why would I spend my time collecting art?

01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:01.740
I want to talk about stuff and ideas and things that actually excite me

01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:03.340
And so that might be part of it

01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:07.500
But also you've had a pretty a pretty I mean at age 36

01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:11.660
You've had economic success beyond your wildest dreams, right?

01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:16.780
And you probably figured out that there's not that much stuff that you can buy. That's really that fun

01:06:17.580 --> 01:06:18.940
all right

01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:24.460
As soon as you as soon as you can fly business class and not have to think about the cost of a coffee

01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:29.660
Most stuff downstream from that. I mean, you know, there'll be some things once I get a family

01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:33.580
There'll be I think that you kind of transcend your own desires in that way

01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:37.420
And it's more to do with providing for the kids and so on and so forth

01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:40.540
But yeah, you know

01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:43.820
I'm very very glad of that and I think

01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:46.540
Lots of people

01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:53.020
Don't realize that they're kind of blessed by having no or a limited materialism set point

01:06:53.580 --> 01:06:59.340
That like if you look at how much money you need in order to be happy with the worldly possessions that you have

01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:01.980
With the degree of keeping up with the Joneses that you're motivated by

01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:08.220
With the shows of affection and love and and gifting that you need to do to other people or that you need from other people in order to feel loved

01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:10.540
If you don't have that

01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:16.220
That's basically like you needing you being a much more efficient system financially

01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:19.820
Like there is somebody else out there who needs 10 times your salary

01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:24.140
To get the same level of satisfaction out of life. So I

01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:26.940
Reframed that probably about

01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:34.700
Five years ago and just it's one of the things that I'm I genuinely feel blessed about whether that's from genes or or environment

01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:38.220
I'm like, I don't need it and it's by the way, it's great

01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:42.700
But it's not a super virtue because we haven't gotten your idol yet

01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:45.740
We're getting that don't worry don't worry and we are getting back down to us soon

01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:49.660
And what you find is that there are certain there are certain guys who are way

01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:52.220
I mean, they they they they objectify themselves

01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:59.500
With their relationship to money in the same way that women often do for the same reasons evolutionarily and and they're in their physical appearance

01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:03.580
Why because this is going to predict your you know, sort of as a as a

01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:07.500
Predictor of your success in mating markets despite the fact that you're not even in mating markets

01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:12.700
So a lot of that's primordial and has to do with you know, what the idol is for all kinds of reasons that we could talk about

01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:13.260
Okay

01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:18.380
Now it's getting uncomfortable because there's two left and you've already through process of elimination told me that these are the

01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:21.500
Things that you care about. Okay. So number one

01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:26.460
um, you know, let's let's put these in order because you got to get rid of one of these pleasure

01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:30.540
An honor you got to get one you got to get rid of one

01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:33.420
Pleasure can go

01:08:33.820 --> 01:08:35.820
You like pleasure, don't you but

01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:37.820
But now I know what you're really like

01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:39.820
I found out what you really want Chris

01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:45.020
It's not a surprise to anybody my desire for prestige to be recognized and validated by the world

01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:50.620
I yeah, I know I know because you're doing this you're doing you're doing something you're performing in public

01:08:50.940 --> 01:08:55.660
And most people who are you know, straw you're in a strong extrovert clearly you have openness to experience

01:08:55.740 --> 01:08:59.820
You have an agreeable nature. You're probably not highly neurotic

01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:04.780
You've got all the things that actually go into somebody surprised if you if you if you do a big five on me

01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:06.780
Uh, I come in

01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:09.260
Uh, neuroticism is uh moderate

01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:10.860
Uh

01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:14.220
Get most of my energy from being on my own. I'm an only child

01:09:14.780 --> 01:09:17.740
Uh, I choose to work on my own. So, you know that

01:09:18.860 --> 01:09:26.540
Turn it on turn it off thing. Um, it's definitely there. But yeah, I I'm glad that I've managed a lot as a an extroverted

01:09:26.540 --> 01:09:30.540
Loan neuroticism person, but uh, I fear that the source code may be slightly different

01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:33.660
It might be it might be and you know, you don't know until you know

01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:37.420
And and you know, there are people who present in a particular way and have a

01:09:37.900 --> 01:09:42.300
Habitat that's quite different because they've been able to they're so good at getting along in society

01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:45.980
But what we do know now is what your weakness is going to be

01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:51.100
So five years from now, I predict you're going to be married and the argument you're going to be having with your wife

01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:56.140
Is because you're going to be doing something that's going to bring you new heights of success

01:09:56.780 --> 01:10:00.620
And your wife is and and then you're going to have this argument with your wife who's going to say

01:10:01.740 --> 01:10:04.300
I don't want you to I want you to be around more chris

01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:08.940
And you're going to say yeah, but you love all the great things that this lifestyle brings

01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:13.020
And then you're mad at me for doing the things that it takes and she said I'll take you

01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:17.500
I mean, I'm going to accept those things that don't have you but I'd prefer to have you

01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:21.260
That's what I predict is the argument that you're going to actually have with your wife because

01:10:21.980 --> 01:10:23.820
You love success

01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:28.140
You love success. It feels good. That's the thing that actually and what do I mean by it feels good

01:10:28.540 --> 01:10:31.740
That means it gives there's a lot of dopamine that comes from success

01:10:31.820 --> 01:10:35.420
Which gives you anticipation of reward and when you get the success

01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:40.620
It taps the ventral tegmental area of the chris brain, which gives you this little burst of joy

01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:46.620
That's what's happening when this one these weird things these markers of success actually happen and those things happen to be

01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:50.140
That centering around the admiration of other people

01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:55.180
That you got to keep your eye on because all the mistakes you make in your life that you look back on with regret

01:10:55.180 --> 01:10:57.180
Are going to be because you follow that particular idol

01:10:58.460 --> 01:11:01.420
Meaning final holsman of the apocalypse

01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:05.020
Yeah, so

01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:07.260
This is the most important meaning

01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:11.900
I can go because I'm very disciplined. I can go a long time without

01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:15.420
Enjoyment and I can go a long time without satisfaction

01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:18.220
But I can't go 10 minutes without meaning and be a happy person

01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:20.700
And this is the biggest problem that we have among young adults today

01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:25.260
I have all kinds of tests that I give people to see whether or not they have a proper sense of meaning in their life

01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:27.500
And I'm not judgmental about what that meaning is going to be

01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:30.460
But I do know I can tell people

01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:35.900
When they have a crisis of meaning and this is the biggest predictor of unhappiness for people in their 20s today

01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:41.340
Now most people in their 20s are actually not in the in the active pursuit of meaning

01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:46.540
Whereas in about 1960 most people were in an active pursuit of meaning

01:11:47.020 --> 01:11:51.820
That's a big generate a set of generational differences that we have and it's a big one of the big

01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:55.100
The biggest explanations for the things that we talked about earlier

01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:58.860
Which is the degradation of of general societal happiness and particularly among the young

01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:03.660
So meaning is actually kind of a combination of three things. It's coherence

01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:06.300
Why things happen the way they do you have to have a

01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:11.900
A theory of the case about why things happen. It doesn't mean it has to be right or it has to be mine

01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:16.940
But you have to like this is why things happen yours tends to be very scientific about why things happen

01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:24.140
Second you have to have a sense of purpose purpose and meaning are not synonymous purpose is a subset of meaning

01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:30.700
That is direction and goals purpose is i'm going in a particular direction towards specific things

01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:32.940
That's what it comes down to

01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:36.620
And significance is the belief that your life matters

01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:39.740
So it's it's coherence

01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:41.340
Purpose and significance

01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:44.620
Now there's a test that I give my students and by the way that I give my children

01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:47.820
My kids are younger than you my kids are in the all three of my kids are in the 20s

01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:51.260
And all three of my kids had to answer these questions

01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:54.940
I made them write a business plan when they were when they were coming out of high school

01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:59.340
You know, which is like a business plan for the enterprise of their lives for the next five years

01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:01.500
I'm a b-school professor. I can do this

01:13:01.660 --> 01:13:05.260
And uh, and I'm the venture capitalist. So, you know, I deserve a business plan

01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:11.260
And and the point was what are you going to do to find the answers to two questions the two meaning questions?

01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:13.500
Why are you alive?

01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:16.460
And for what are you willing to give your life joyfully at this hour?

01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:20.860
You need answers to those questions. You need to be alive for a reason

01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:24.700
And you need to be willing to stop being alive for a reason

01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:27.340
those are the meaning questions so

01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:31.020
What are your answers? Why do you believe you're alive?

01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:33.260
Why are you on earth?

01:13:33.260 --> 01:13:36.300
A sperm and an egg is not the right answer and a stork isn't either

01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:39.660
I think

01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:42.380
The thing that I often come back to when I ask myself this question is

01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:48.060
Uh to understand myself and the world around me. I get so much

01:13:49.820 --> 01:13:51.820
Joy, I'm at my best when

01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:58.060
I'm learning about things and engaging with ideas downstream from that

01:13:58.060 --> 01:14:01.180
I can teach you to other people and do all of the rest of the stuff, but um

01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:06.860
Maybe I'm revealing my sort of only child bona fides here, but so much of it is just

01:14:07.580 --> 01:14:10.700
me understanding myself and the world around me like that's

01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:15.020
It's been the single lineage trajectory throughout

01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:17.740
All of the good things that I've done

01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:21.980
Yeah, no, and and you just told me what you want to do with this life that you have

01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:26.960
What you enjoy the most where you find the greatest productivity, but this is a little bit different

01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:30.940
Why do you think that you were placed on this earth?

01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:34.620
What is the purpose for which you were placed on this earth?

01:14:35.820 --> 01:14:40.060
Now if if you're a radical materialist, you might say it's just all random, man

01:14:40.620 --> 01:14:45.260
I wasn't I wasn't nobody down. Yeah. Yeah for sure. But my guess is you don't believe that

01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:48.780
Why why did the universe create Chris Williamson?

01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:54.860
I think to find and talk about good ideas that seems to be the thing that comes to me

01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:59.260
You want to serve others? You just told me why why do you want to talk about things?

01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:03.020
Otherwise, you wouldn't bother we wouldn't be having we're having a conversation in public

01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:09.820
Why because we want people to listen to it and it might just be completely venal on your on my part because by the way

01:15:10.220 --> 01:15:15.500
My idols map exactly onto yours. I'm the 60 year old version of you. Sorry

01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:18.060
I know I know it's like maybe you'll you'll still have hair

01:15:20.300 --> 01:15:22.700
If you're lucky, but but okay

01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:29.020
If it's purely venal, that's just not good and that's a that's that's a bad answer to the question

01:15:29.020 --> 01:15:32.220
but if it really is I want to serve the world by

01:15:32.940 --> 01:15:34.940
uncovering its mysteries

01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:39.580
And in so doing people will be able to lead better informed better lives

01:15:40.460 --> 01:15:42.460
In other words, you were created to serve

01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:44.620
In a certain way solid

01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:46.780
now it gets harder

01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:50.060
For what would you give your life joyfully at this at this hour?

01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:52.380
Mom dad and

01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:56.220
Like perhaps a golden retriever that's younger than five years old

01:15:57.100 --> 01:16:00.940
Would you really give your life for your mom and dad? Yeah

01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:08.540
You would die for them despite the fact that they're significantly older. Yeah. I mean, they would they would be I would be in a lot of trouble

01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:11.900
But it's something that I would be prepared to do

01:16:12.620 --> 01:16:17.260
There would absolutely as with almost anything I've ever had to do with them. There would be a very long portrayal

01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:21.180
Negotiation, which would all of us would be dead before that was finished. So it might be a moot question

01:16:21.740 --> 01:16:25.900
It's a hard one and it's a especially hard question for young adults who don't have children yet

01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:28.140
It's a really hard one, right?

01:16:28.140 --> 01:16:32.300
Where are we getting that deepest sense of meaning from what is that that we've transcended ourselves with?

01:16:32.300 --> 01:16:36.380
You're like, you know, you know from the utilitarian perspective when you think

01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:39.660
Ah, how much longer if mom and dad got left and what do they really want to do?

01:16:39.660 --> 01:16:43.340
Ah, you know, what do you look at what you can give the world you haven't even passed on the genes yet?

01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:49.260
Like even from their perspective, they would probably say even fuck you like just don't let especially because I'm an only child

01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:53.500
Like don't let the bloodline end here. Like god dammit. Like at least, you know, like

01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:58.620
Come into a cup before you do this so that we can you know, you're some some lady in a turkey base to somewhere

01:16:58.620 --> 01:17:03.100
I can actually keep this guy. I don't know. But yeah, it's uh, it's difficult one. It's difficult one, man

01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:07.340
Like to think about for sure. It wouldn't be like it wouldn't be my uh, country of birth

01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:10.140
and it wouldn't be my uh

01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:11.740
country of birth

01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:16.700
And it wouldn't be my uh new country of adoption. It wouldn't be the faith that I don't have

01:17:17.260 --> 01:17:18.940
uh, it wouldn't be the

01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:20.940
sports team that I

01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:22.940
barely keep up to date with

01:17:23.980 --> 01:17:26.460
What's your sports team by the way texas rangers?

01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:30.140
Really? Oh, yeah, I'm a bar. I'm a barsa man

01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:33.020
the um

01:17:33.180 --> 01:17:39.980
Well, we both we've both swapped sports. I've followed an mlb team and you've followed a like Spanish football team

01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:43.420
I I married a catalan. There's no other way. There's no other way to

01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:47.340
Keep family harmony. Well, do you have a best friend?

01:17:48.300 --> 01:17:51.100
Yeah, would you would you would you die for him?

01:17:53.740 --> 01:17:56.620
I definitely consider it. I bet you would

01:17:59.020 --> 01:18:01.020
He's younger than me

01:18:01.660 --> 01:18:05.660
The utilitarian and you again. Yeah, I fucking just can't get out can't get out the front of my brain

01:18:06.060 --> 01:18:10.860
But this is the point this is that this is the introspection that's required to actually find a full sense of meaning

01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:15.580
This is worth going away for five days on a silent retreat and thinking about these questions

01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:21.820
And it's funny because you know, my adult kids have come to very different revelations about this because I push them push them push them push them

01:18:21.820 --> 01:18:25.980
I have a I have a son who's a sniper. I have a son who's a marine sniper

01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:30.140
Um, and he just got out of the Marine Corps now. He's he's he's in the reserves

01:18:30.140 --> 01:18:34.780
But he was active duty for four years as a marine sniper. This is a this is a scary job, man

01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:41.980
For me as his father and he went in as a knucklehead, you know, and he came out at 23 married

01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:44.700
He's now five months out. His wife is pregnant

01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:47.100
Um, and here's his answers

01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:52.860
I mean because he found his answers by by actually putting his life in danger and doing all these really like wicked things

01:18:53.420 --> 01:18:54.940
um

01:18:54.940 --> 01:19:00.380
My I was created because god made me to serve other people. You know, he believes that these are not the right answers

01:19:00.380 --> 01:19:06.700
These are his answers. Um, I would joyfully die for my faith and for my family and for my fellow marines

01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:11.100
And for the united states of america and our allies chris. So this is

01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:13.740
This is

01:19:13.740 --> 01:19:21.180
Solid stuff and and he's i'm telling you he he actually has called me I screamed his call because he called while we were talking

01:19:21.820 --> 01:19:28.940
Sorry sniper. Don't don't shoot me through the window. There's carlos. He's the best and he's six foot five and he's you know covered in tats

01:19:29.660 --> 01:19:31.420
and um, he's

01:19:31.420 --> 01:19:33.660
He's happy because he has these answers to these questions

01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:37.980
But he did the work is really what it comes down to and this is what I recommend to a lot of people who feel

01:19:38.460 --> 01:19:42.140
That little bit of hollowness that slight bit of deadness within

01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:47.180
Where things that i'm doing every day, you know, it's like, I don't know I don't want to stand in this line

01:19:47.260 --> 01:19:52.700
What's the meaning of me actually drive sitting in traffic and doing this when you have the answers to those questions?

01:19:53.100 --> 01:19:56.860
There's a why for even the most trivial things that you're doing in your life

01:19:57.020 --> 01:20:00.700
And that's a really really beautiful thing if I can do one thing for people

01:20:01.100 --> 01:20:06.060
It's actually to encourage them to look for the answers to those questions. How can we improve our coherence?

01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:11.180
So our coherence is the why things happen the way that they do

01:20:12.220 --> 01:20:16.940
And uh that theory of the case is really tricky, but it gets back to the sense of transcendence

01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:22.060
If you pursue a strategy of transcendence coherence comes in its wake

01:20:22.620 --> 01:20:25.980
Even if you can't quite articulate why things happen the way they do

01:20:26.220 --> 01:20:29.020
You have a sense of why things happen the way that they do

01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:32.700
If you study dystoic philosophers with the utmost seriousness

01:20:33.100 --> 01:20:39.820
The understanding of why things happen the way they do even if they're random and even if they're unfair becomes acceptable to you

01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:43.500
And that acceptance of that is a sense of coherence on its face

01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:50.940
Maybe you're a complete radically physicalist atheist who denies the utter existence of free will if you study the science

01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:57.980
With enough seriousness of that you can you can make your peace with a coherence that actually comes from the randomness of the universe

01:20:58.060 --> 01:20:59.580
my father was a

01:20:59.580 --> 01:21:02.780
phd biostatistician he was the smartest guy ever met

01:21:03.580 --> 01:21:05.020
and um

01:21:05.020 --> 01:21:09.020
He said when he was dying of cancer when he was more he was just a little bit older than me

01:21:09.820 --> 01:21:11.820
and I said it's just

01:21:12.220 --> 01:21:15.180
Sucks it's not fair and he said

01:21:16.060 --> 01:21:18.380
Somebody's gonna be on the left side of the distribution

01:21:21.820 --> 01:21:23.820
Hahaha

01:21:28.060 --> 01:21:34.140
Spoken spoken like a man that looked at a lot of graphs throughout his career. It's coherence, baby

01:21:35.740 --> 01:21:39.420
But you can get coherence in a lot of different ways. You just have to do the work

01:21:40.220 --> 01:21:42.220
To figure out what you believe

01:21:42.860 --> 01:21:44.860
purpose

01:21:45.740 --> 01:21:50.620
Purpose to to to create the goals and the directionality of your life

01:21:51.660 --> 01:21:54.380
Now this is not a sense of attachment a lot of people will say well

01:21:54.460 --> 01:21:56.380
I'm gonna make my bucket list

01:21:56.380 --> 01:22:02.060
And I'm gonna earn this and I'm gonna do that and I'm gonna meet this person and I'm gonna you know shake hands with the president

01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:08.780
I don't know whatever the dumb thing is that people are really into that's not it the buddhist talk about intentionality without attachment

01:22:09.660 --> 01:22:15.100
Now there's a there's a the way to think about purpose. There's a do you speak Spanish right chris? No

01:22:15.740 --> 01:22:19.580
Okay, there's a word in Spanish. It's a very evocative word is rumbo

01:22:20.060 --> 01:22:26.460
Which in in English is it's not common. It's called rum line rhum rum line. It's a navigational term

01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:28.700
That's the straight line

01:22:28.860 --> 01:22:31.660
That goes from where you are to where you want to wind up

01:22:32.220 --> 01:22:38.140
To do navigation properly you need a rum line rumbo is actually used in Spanish in the vernacular to say

01:22:38.380 --> 01:22:41.660
This is your directionality. This is to figure out your purpose in life

01:22:42.060 --> 01:22:47.820
What you need to figure out is where you think it would be good to end up to have a straight line to get there

01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:53.180
And then have a complete utter lack of attachment on whether or not you're sitting on that rum line

01:22:54.140 --> 01:22:58.380
That turns out to be the way to understand purpose. That's intention without attachment

01:22:58.780 --> 01:23:00.620
Of course, I'm going to lay out the things that I want to do

01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:03.100
Of course, I'm going to and I am completely

01:23:04.140 --> 01:23:08.860
Flexible if life takes me in another direction for something that actually meets my moral

01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:15.020
Metaphysical my love goals in a better way. That's the way to actually be thinking about purpose

01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:16.860
if

01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:19.180
Suffering and difficulty are so important to meaning

01:23:20.060 --> 01:23:22.300
How do you advise new parents who are

01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:25.100
Successful because of the challenges in their past

01:23:25.420 --> 01:23:27.420
But now have more resources

01:23:27.580 --> 01:23:31.740
To make life easier for their kids than their parents did when they were growing up

01:23:32.060 --> 01:23:37.020
That by using the things that they've worked for they may rob their children of the very challenges that would make them happy

01:23:37.580 --> 01:23:40.860
Yeah, guilty by the way guilty guilty is charged

01:23:41.580 --> 01:23:44.140
You know, I'd say it's a the greatest

01:23:44.780 --> 01:23:48.460
Privilege is feeling like you've had a lot of success and you earned it

01:23:49.100 --> 01:23:51.100
That's an incredible privilege

01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:57.100
The greatest I mean the the the worst thing you can do for your children is making them wonder whether or not they earned their success

01:23:57.500 --> 01:23:59.900
Like did I did it was a me or is it my dad?

01:24:00.460 --> 01:24:05.580
You know, was somebody kicking down the door for me. Am I a baby nebo? I mean what what what right?

01:24:05.660 --> 01:24:08.940
That's a real problem and a lot of that has to do with the fact that that we're

01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:13.900
We're simply trying to make it so that the difficulties are cleared away exactly as you say

01:24:14.140 --> 01:24:16.300
This leads to a lot of problems that we see today

01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:20.460
Safetyism, you know, the fact that we're we're completely

01:24:20.940 --> 01:24:27.100
Freaked out about a lot of difficulties that don't exist and we're and we're inured to the problems that really do exist

01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:30.380
So we don't let our kids walk to the store, but we give them, you know

01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:34.460
As you know unlimited access to smartphones and social media

01:24:34.940 --> 01:24:40.540
at age 13 and like predators and creeps and god forbid politicians and you know

01:24:41.580 --> 01:24:48.460
Dictators on tiktok. Yeah, our are climbing out of the screen and into their brains and you know and and and

01:24:48.940 --> 01:24:53.340
Destroying their sense of self-worth and and creating social comparison and all these deleterious things

01:24:54.300 --> 01:24:58.060
What we need to do is to set our kids up to do really hard things

01:24:58.780 --> 01:25:02.940
And and and it's telling them that it's okay if they fail

01:25:03.740 --> 01:25:07.820
Not because what we tell them when we're when we're protecting them from everything is that it's not okay to fail

01:25:08.220 --> 01:25:13.820
And we create a pathological fear of failure, which is a death fear. We're giving our kids a death fear

01:25:14.700 --> 01:25:16.700
Death all death is

01:25:16.860 --> 01:25:19.820
Is the death of who you are to you? There's an essence to you

01:25:19.820 --> 01:25:22.940
So a client would say that your soul is your christness

01:25:23.660 --> 01:25:25.660
That a dog's soul is this dogginess

01:25:26.380 --> 01:25:28.060
Each one of us has an essence to us

01:25:28.060 --> 01:25:31.180
No, we define that essence on the basis of who we see ourselves

01:25:31.420 --> 01:25:38.060
And if you are never allowed to fail you become the person who doesn't fail and failure becomes a death fear for you

01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:40.460
Why would you install a death fear on your kids?

01:25:40.780 --> 01:25:43.580
Well, because you want to keep them safe and that's a terrible thing to do

01:25:43.660 --> 01:25:47.740
So the way to get beyond that even if you're blessed with tremendous financial resources

01:25:47.740 --> 01:25:49.740
So they don't have to worry about making rent

01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:54.540
When they're kids they don't have to worry about getting their caloric needs is you have to say

01:25:54.700 --> 01:25:57.740
I expect you to be doing difficult things

01:25:58.300 --> 01:26:03.900
And I don't expect you to succeed all the time if you're not failing enough. You're not doing it, right?

01:26:04.060 --> 01:26:07.820
That's and and and okay now you're gonna say how do I do that? Okay. Here's how you do it

01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:13.100
Do it yourself. It does not matter what you tell your kids all that matters is what they see

01:26:13.900 --> 01:26:15.900
If you want your kids to grow up in the catholic faith

01:26:16.540 --> 01:26:21.020
Make sure that they see you on your knees on sunday. That's all that matters

01:26:21.580 --> 01:26:26.540
If you want your kids to do hard things do hard things if you want your kids to deal with failure fail

01:26:27.180 --> 01:26:29.980
And and have them see you'll see how you fail and that's why

01:26:30.540 --> 01:26:34.140
these lessons in modern wisdom are important for 60 year olds and 20 year olds and

01:26:34.780 --> 01:26:36.780
kids

01:26:37.100 --> 01:26:39.100
Talk to me about the difference between

01:26:39.580 --> 01:26:41.580
happiness and unhappiness

01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:49.180
Is unhappiness simply the absence of happiness? Are they different networks the ways to avoid them separately?

01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:53.420
Happiness is not the opposite opposite of unhappiness on the contrary

01:26:53.500 --> 01:26:55.980
So the the experience of happiness has a lot to do with

01:26:56.460 --> 01:27:01.260
But positive emotion and the experience of unhappiness has a lot to do with negative emotion

01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:05.340
We go through life with different kinds of positive and negative moods

01:27:05.340 --> 01:27:09.500
And they're largely produced in different with different structures of the limbic system of the brain

01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:14.780
Because we're reacting to different outside circumstances some of which are opportunities and some of which are threats

01:27:15.020 --> 01:27:21.500
So it makes perfect sense that that unhappiness is not the absence of happiness. These are different sensations

01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:24.860
Largely unhappiness is experienced on the right side of the brain

01:27:25.420 --> 01:27:30.220
And unhappiness on the left side of the brain and we know this because of the musculature of the face when people are experiencing

01:27:30.300 --> 01:27:33.420
A lot of negative emotion the left side of the face is more active

01:27:33.900 --> 01:27:38.460
And you can tell you know when somebody's about to cry the left side of their face is more active

01:27:38.460 --> 01:27:42.300
It twitches a little bit you get when you're when you're married you'll see this

01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:45.980
And you're like, uh-oh

01:27:46.300 --> 01:27:49.100
You get like a five second warning. It's just amazing

01:27:49.740 --> 01:27:53.660
If you you know, it's like it's what it's like if your husband is studies neuroscience

01:27:53.820 --> 01:28:00.300
So it's important that we understand that because then we can manage both our happiness and our unhappiness and we can see

01:28:01.260 --> 01:28:03.100
Which is a greater?

01:28:03.100 --> 01:28:05.100
Which is a greater challenge?

01:28:05.180 --> 01:28:11.900
Happiness or unhappiness in our lives for me happiness is not the greater challenge for me unhappiness is a greater challenge

01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:13.900
I have very high negative affect

01:28:14.140 --> 01:28:20.380
I'm a normal i'm a naturally negative affect person because I fall in this personality characteristic called the mad scientist

01:28:20.620 --> 01:28:24.380
Which is unusually high positive mood and unusually high negative mood

01:28:24.860 --> 01:28:28.780
That's important thing for us to understand that that that that you know

01:28:29.420 --> 01:28:30.860
Which is your challenge?

01:28:30.860 --> 01:28:36.380
And so I'm spending a lot of my effort managing my unhappiness as opposed to trying to boost my happiness

01:28:36.780 --> 01:28:41.580
And there are lots of there are terrible ways to do that like drinking alcohol looking at pornography gambling

01:28:42.540 --> 01:28:47.900
Workaholism the best way to do that by the way is vigorous physical exercise seven days a week

01:28:48.060 --> 01:28:50.940
And so that's what I do to start my day the first hour of the morning

01:28:51.420 --> 01:28:53.660
Not because I'm some sort of you know, look

01:28:54.380 --> 01:28:56.380
vanity doesn't favor me

01:28:56.620 --> 01:28:58.620
The reason that I do that is because

01:28:59.180 --> 01:29:01.180
Um, I I want to feel less unhappy

01:29:02.300 --> 01:29:08.620
So there are different pathways for making people more happy versus making people less unhappy

01:29:09.340 --> 01:29:15.420
And all of the stuff that we've gone through so far although fantastic and maybe great for refining your happiness level

01:29:15.980 --> 01:29:17.980
you can still be

01:29:18.540 --> 01:29:23.900
Pressing the accelerator harder whilst you've still got the brake pushed down if you don't look at these things which cause unhappiness

01:29:23.980 --> 01:29:27.100
So what are the other biggest strategies beyond?

01:29:27.980 --> 01:29:30.860
High intensity training that you do seven days a week. What are the

01:29:31.740 --> 01:29:33.260
highest return

01:29:33.260 --> 01:29:35.260
Uh tactics that you use

01:29:35.260 --> 01:29:37.260
Clear away the barriers to your happiness

01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:42.620
Because one of the sources of unhappiness is not having access to the sources of happiness in your life

01:29:42.940 --> 01:29:45.740
That's a source of aggravation and frustration

01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:53.020
So clear away the barriers by by by getting rid of your prejudices against trying to develop your faith or spiritual life

01:29:53.980 --> 01:29:59.340
Clear away the barriers to the prejudices that you have and and the the difficulties that you have toward family life

01:29:59.900 --> 01:30:01.100
friendship

01:30:01.100 --> 01:30:05.260
The the behavior and attitudes that you have toward work, etc. That's really important

01:30:05.580 --> 01:30:10.060
third and probably for many people the most important is taking seriously the

01:30:10.700 --> 01:30:13.180
mood disorders that are so common in our society today

01:30:13.740 --> 01:30:20.700
understanding the essence of what what chronic and and and generalized anxiety is all about in people's lives what

01:30:21.180 --> 01:30:27.260
What clinical depression actually means and how to treat it because the greatest source of unhappiness and misery for a lot of people

01:30:27.260 --> 01:30:27.980
It's just

01:30:27.980 --> 01:30:29.660
Straight on common mood disorders

01:30:29.660 --> 01:30:34.060
And they can't actually even get to the better things in their lives because of these barriers that are actually coming in the

01:30:34.380 --> 01:30:36.380
In terms of these sources of unhappiness

01:30:36.380 --> 01:30:38.380
That's the big ones that i'm talking about

01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:39.740
general

01:30:39.740 --> 01:30:45.580
High levels of negative affect that do not go into mood disorder. I strongly recommend physical diet and exercise

01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:50.380
You know the the kinds of self care that that have a lot of discomfort attached to them

01:30:50.860 --> 01:30:56.380
Always be thinking about the hygiene of removing barriers to your happiness and taking care of your mental health

01:30:56.540 --> 01:30:58.540
Those are the best ways to think about it

01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:02.300
Why do you think it is in the modern world that

01:31:03.020 --> 01:31:05.500
Anxiety appears to be the most prevalent

01:31:06.380 --> 01:31:10.220
emotional state that people are in why has that one emotion

01:31:11.260 --> 01:31:13.260
grabbed a hold of

01:31:13.340 --> 01:31:15.340
the 21st century so much

01:31:15.580 --> 01:31:20.540
Anxiety is unfocused fear fear is a natural physiological phenomenon that

01:31:20.940 --> 01:31:22.940
that comes from

01:31:22.940 --> 01:31:27.180
A stimulus that that that then lights up the amygdala in the brain passing a

01:31:28.460 --> 01:31:31.260
A signal through the hypothalamus into the pituitary glands thus

01:31:31.820 --> 01:31:37.980
Leading to the adrenal glands putting out epinephrine and later on cortisol stress hormones in response to some sort of a threat

01:31:38.060 --> 01:31:41.900
That should be intense and episodic the problem in modern life

01:31:42.380 --> 01:31:47.100
Is that that we don't have these intense episodic episodes of fear on the contrary

01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:51.420
We have we have minor threats that are very diffuse but chronic

01:31:52.140 --> 01:31:55.820
And that is that leads to an unfocused fear aka anxiety

01:31:55.820 --> 01:32:01.260
Which is a very slight drip of cortisol going into your brain again and again and again and again

01:32:01.420 --> 01:32:03.420
And how do you get it by opening up twitter?

01:32:03.580 --> 01:32:08.140
How do you get it by by being on a you know an overly long zoom call when you need to pee?

01:32:08.700 --> 01:32:12.380
How do you get it by actually being in a you know a work relationship?

01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:19.260
That's ridiculously tense that you're not doing anything about modern life is all about not having your life threatened

01:32:19.340 --> 01:32:23.340
But feeling constantly under a little bit of threat which gives you unfocused fear

01:32:23.660 --> 01:32:29.180
That leads to a stress response that comes from your adrenal glands and that gives you a tremendous amount of agony

01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:31.500
That's just spread out and constant

01:32:34.780 --> 01:32:36.460
I

01:32:36.460 --> 01:32:39.020
One of the things that you've mentioned that you you said that you have a

01:32:39.980 --> 01:32:43.900
Disposition toward negative emotional states

01:32:44.700 --> 01:32:48.780
How much have you found in your practice and also with yourself that people can?

01:32:49.740 --> 01:32:51.740
Rewrite their childhood and their past history

01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:54.300
Because I think a lot of people feel

01:32:54.780 --> 01:33:01.260
Trapped by their past and that they're stuck in their patterns and that you know this all sounds well and good Arthur

01:33:01.260 --> 01:33:08.700
But really what you're talking about is sort of putting a little bit of icing and some sprinkles on the top of a dog

01:33:08.780 --> 01:33:09.900
cake

01:33:09.900 --> 01:33:14.060
You can rewrite your past you can't actually make a different past

01:33:14.060 --> 01:33:17.260
What you can do is is understand your memories in different ways

01:33:17.260 --> 01:33:22.380
And it starts with an understanding of how memory actually works in the brain memories are not extant

01:33:22.460 --> 01:33:27.180
They're reassembled from all different kinds of parts. That's the reason that memory is so unreliable

01:33:27.660 --> 01:33:32.940
You can remember with incredible vividness what happened on 9 11. I was in new york on 9 11

01:33:33.020 --> 01:33:35.660
I saw the first plane hit the first tower

01:33:36.380 --> 01:33:38.780
I mean it was I remember it vividly

01:33:39.020 --> 01:33:44.940
But but the data show that what I remember vividly is probably not completely accurate because I'm

01:33:45.340 --> 01:33:48.220
Reassembling that memory so frequently from different literally

01:33:48.220 --> 01:33:51.340
I mean the different parts of the memory are stored in different locations in the brain

01:33:51.740 --> 01:33:56.060
And those will get corrupted just like files will get corrupted in a computer from time to time

01:33:56.380 --> 01:34:00.780
And one of the ways that will get corrupted is because of the biases that I have in my ordinary life

01:34:01.340 --> 01:34:04.940
This is the reason that you and your sister I realize you don't have a sister

01:34:04.940 --> 01:34:09.020
But if you had a sister you and your sister could be looking back to a Thanksgiving 15 years ago

01:34:09.020 --> 01:34:11.100
Which I realized you didn't have and have because you're british

01:34:11.580 --> 01:34:17.900
But and and one of you could say oh that Thanksgiving with uncle mark and aunt betty

01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:22.460
It was so great and your sister was like wasn't that the wasn't that the one where uncle mark

01:34:23.180 --> 01:34:28.060
Got you know blind drunk and and then beat up the neighbor and passed out in the front yard

01:34:28.940 --> 01:34:30.940
That was terrible that year

01:34:31.020 --> 01:34:36.140
You're both right, but you're assembling the memories from different places with biases and emphases

01:34:36.620 --> 01:34:41.340
Placed in different parts of the memory with different corruptions that have happened across the decades

01:34:41.980 --> 01:34:46.540
That's a really important thing because you can reassemble your memories in different ways

01:34:47.420 --> 01:34:53.100
By by helping people to emphasize the parts of the experiences in your past that were positive and not just negative

01:34:53.340 --> 01:34:55.340
Some people are retrospectively

01:34:55.340 --> 01:34:57.180
unbelievably negative

01:34:57.180 --> 01:35:02.060
And and that has everything to do with the way that they've stored and are reassembling their memories

01:35:02.700 --> 01:35:04.700
And and you don't have to do that

01:35:04.780 --> 01:35:09.260
You can actually choose to look back on the parts of your childhood that actually were sweet

01:35:09.340 --> 01:35:13.360
And the more that you do that the better you'll get at doing that and the more that you'll naturally

01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:17.340
Reassemble those memories in ways that favor you more and you're not wrong

01:35:17.820 --> 01:35:23.180
You're just looking at different parts of the experience and repairing the you know the memory the memory assembly process

01:35:23.740 --> 01:35:29.100
Yeah, I love that. What about the role of envy another emotion that's very prevalent in the modern world?

01:35:29.420 --> 01:35:31.420
What what is that to say about envy?

01:35:31.420 --> 01:35:35.980
It's evolved and the reason is because we live in a hierarchical kin based species

01:35:36.620 --> 01:35:39.660
We actually were tropical. We're a tropical species

01:35:40.540 --> 01:35:46.220
Evolved to live in kin groups that are hierarchical now some of that we can get beyond like, you know

01:35:46.220 --> 01:35:50.140
We invented coats so we don't have to live in really hot places anymore

01:35:50.620 --> 01:35:54.060
But some of it we haven't gotten beyond we're still kin based and we are still

01:35:54.540 --> 01:36:00.780
Very hierarchical and the way that you you tend to see your likelihood of survival and gene propagation

01:36:01.020 --> 01:36:06.540
Is rising in the hierarchy and the way that you know that you're rising in the hierarchy is paying attention to people who have more than you

01:36:07.180 --> 01:36:11.340
And wanting what people have who have more than you a k a n b now

01:36:11.980 --> 01:36:16.460
That's a big I mean, that's a that's a survival tendency in in the Pleistocene

01:36:16.540 --> 01:36:22.220
But it's a it's maladapted to the to the modern world and it's exacerbated by the technological

01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:28.620
Innovations that we've had such that we're aware of the hierarchy of the entire human race all the time

01:36:29.180 --> 01:36:30.300
on social media

01:36:30.300 --> 01:36:33.980
The biggest problem that we have is you don't feel envious of you know, the loser

01:36:34.460 --> 01:36:37.660
You know down the street from you who has a slightly different

01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:41.900
You know rv up on blocks in his yard compared to yours

01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:43.900
you envy

01:36:43.900 --> 01:36:49.500
The Kardashians, which is completely absurd you have you you envy somebody who's got

01:36:50.060 --> 01:36:54.460
You know all the wealth in the world you envy a billionaire despite the fact that you've never met one in person

01:36:54.700 --> 01:36:59.020
So that's the biggest problem that we've taken an evolutionary tendency and we've blown it up with tech

01:36:59.180 --> 01:37:02.300
With our technological means and turned it into an actual form of mental illness

01:37:03.340 --> 01:37:09.820
That means that we have to take it on on his face and use our prefrontal cortex to combat these limbic tendencies that are ruining your lives

01:37:10.380 --> 01:37:12.060
That's a lot of what I talk about

01:37:12.060 --> 01:37:17.420
You mean making sure that you're you're you're consciously not comparing yourself to people outside your group

01:37:17.980 --> 01:37:23.740
To you know to if you need to get rid of the apps and stop paying attention to these rich people

01:37:23.900 --> 01:37:27.740
Only because you enjoy watching the lifestyles of these rich and famous folks

01:37:28.140 --> 01:37:30.140
That's an unhealthy thing for you to do

01:37:30.700 --> 01:37:33.580
A lot of the things that I often talk about to get rid of this as well is to

01:37:34.060 --> 01:37:37.180
Is is to to separate your envy from from benign

01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:43.020
From the malicious malicious envy is that you feel envious of people who have something that you don't feel that they've earned

01:37:43.660 --> 01:37:49.580
Ignore that and pay attention to where you have benign envy where you think that they've done something that's really virtuous

01:37:49.900 --> 01:37:51.900
And turn your envy into admiration

01:37:52.620 --> 01:37:58.060
And then you've actually made it into something that's really beneficial that will benefit you and won't make the world worse

01:37:59.180 --> 01:38:01.180
Yeah, it's so interesting to think about how

01:38:02.140 --> 01:38:03.260
that

01:38:03.260 --> 01:38:05.260
very adaptive

01:38:05.420 --> 01:38:09.900
Impulse that we had I need to track my place within the hierarchy, but you know

01:38:10.700 --> 01:38:15.180
That was 150 people if that it was probably actually 70 people

01:38:15.580 --> 01:38:21.580
Probably 30 70 and yeah, just speaking of what we were talking about earlier on when we were discussing the

01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:30.940
Slot that your intimate partner takes up. I had robin dunbar. He's been on the show twice now. Maybe three times. He's so

01:38:31.660 --> 01:38:36.060
Fantastic the first time I ever recorded with him. It was I think 8 p.m. On a Friday

01:38:36.620 --> 01:38:43.420
Evening in the uk 2 p.m. Here in austin and he just had a big glass of wine that he slowly worked his way through as he was just

01:38:44.380 --> 01:38:45.900
unloading

01:38:45.900 --> 01:38:49.100
evolutionary psychology social psychology insights, but

01:38:50.300 --> 01:38:54.460
One of the you know, you've got this sort of small group within maybe a slightly larger tribe

01:38:54.780 --> 01:38:58.380
And you can track your place within that hierarchy relatively easily

01:38:58.460 --> 01:39:03.900
But if envy is the only one of the seven deadly sins that doesn't feel good, which is kind of an interesting insight

01:39:04.460 --> 01:39:07.820
Not even fun. Not even fun. Not even fun to do it. Um

01:39:09.500 --> 01:39:13.980
You have essentially an unlimited way that an envious mind can find to

01:39:14.460 --> 01:39:18.140
Subjugate you below someone else. Well, yeah, sure

01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:19.580
I've got more money than them

01:39:19.580 --> 01:39:23.980
But they seem to be a little bit better educated than me or their wife slightly hotter or they drive a faster car

01:39:24.300 --> 01:39:27.420
Or you know, they seem to be a bit more muscular or or whatever like, you know

01:39:27.500 --> 01:39:30.700
There's a million different ways that you can do this with now

01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:33.500
essentially an unlimited global

01:39:33.900 --> 01:39:36.940
Marketplace hierarchy within which you can compare yourself

01:39:37.580 --> 01:39:40.780
Yeah, this is one of the reasons that men have now become orthorexic

01:39:41.420 --> 01:39:43.580
You know that men men are now weirdly

01:39:44.220 --> 01:39:44.940
um

01:39:44.940 --> 01:39:51.100
Comparing their biceps men my age are paying attention to you know, the you know, they're

01:39:51.660 --> 01:39:56.780
Physical prowess by looking at, you know, these youtube channels in ways that we wouldn't have any concept of it

01:39:56.780 --> 01:39:58.540
They were to live happily

01:39:58.540 --> 01:40:01.580
But instead they're like, I don't know man. I think I need to go on trt

01:40:02.380 --> 01:40:05.660
Why because I don't know. I mean, I'm looking at all these other guys. They look great

01:40:05.980 --> 01:40:08.620
You wouldn't even have a you wouldn't be conscious of this. You'd be, you know

01:40:08.780 --> 01:40:11.180
Happily living your life in your own silo

01:40:11.740 --> 01:40:15.980
But this exposure that we have to this massive comparison group is

01:40:16.140 --> 01:40:20.700
unbelievably unhealthy because you're always doing this hierarchically

01:40:21.500 --> 01:40:22.700
evolved

01:40:22.700 --> 01:40:26.620
Thing this tendency this habit that we actually have and you have to combat it on purpose

01:40:26.620 --> 01:40:29.740
There's no way that you're just going to make it go away by by changing your environment

01:40:30.140 --> 01:40:33.340
This brings up one key point by the way because of all these things that we're talking about

01:40:33.740 --> 01:40:39.580
It's very efficient inefficient to try to improve your life by changing the whole outside world

01:40:40.300 --> 01:40:43.740
It's very inefficient to curate the entire outside world

01:40:44.060 --> 01:40:46.060
It's efficient to work on it yourself

01:40:46.620 --> 01:40:53.660
By moving your experiences from your limbic system into your prefrontal cortex aka to be metacognitive. That's why that's what I talk about all the time

01:40:54.620 --> 01:40:56.460
We've gone through a lot of the big

01:40:56.460 --> 01:40:59.260
Sexy things I think from your recent thesis

01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:01.820
Is there anything

01:41:01.820 --> 01:41:05.180
from your book or from your work and from this kind of domain of work in general

01:41:06.140 --> 01:41:07.340
that

01:41:07.340 --> 01:41:09.660
people you wish people paid more attention to

01:41:10.140 --> 01:41:14.300
Is there something that is seemingly unpopular and sexy but

01:41:14.940 --> 01:41:21.660
Has more bang for its buck that you wish you could bestow more people to remember it when you when they read stuff that you've put out

01:41:22.460 --> 01:41:24.460
Yeah, I mean

01:41:25.260 --> 01:41:27.260
There's a concept that people don't

01:41:27.980 --> 01:41:34.460
Pay attention to very much because our world is largely been organized over the past 30 years

01:41:35.340 --> 01:41:36.700
by

01:41:36.700 --> 01:41:37.900
by

01:41:37.900 --> 01:41:39.900
technicians engineers and bureaucrats

01:41:40.780 --> 01:41:47.500
We've actually we've handed the keys in our culture over to people that say that if we can solve a series of complicated problems

01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:49.500
We'll live in peace and happiness forever

01:41:50.540 --> 01:41:56.140
That's a completely misguided understanding of the human experience. There's two kinds of problems in life

01:41:56.860 --> 01:41:59.420
There's complicated problems that engineers solve

01:41:59.980 --> 01:42:01.980
these are problems that are

01:42:02.460 --> 01:42:06.300
ferociously hard to solve but once you solve them you can replicate them with effortless ease

01:42:07.180 --> 01:42:11.740
That's like making a toaster or a jet engine. Those are complicated problems

01:42:12.380 --> 01:42:15.900
All the problems that we really care about in life are complex problems

01:42:15.980 --> 01:42:23.500
Which is to say that they're very easy to understand the solution and completely impossible to solve because they're dynamic in nature

01:42:24.860 --> 01:42:28.940
Your toaster is complicated. Your cat is complicated is complex

01:42:29.580 --> 01:42:35.580
It's you know what it wants. It's warmth and scratches and a litter box and food

01:42:35.740 --> 01:42:37.740
But you never know what it's going to do

01:42:37.740 --> 01:42:39.740
That's why it's interesting

01:42:39.740 --> 01:42:43.820
Your your marriage is complex, right? It's very complex

01:42:43.820 --> 01:42:45.900
You know what it means to be happy in your marriage

01:42:45.900 --> 01:42:51.500
But you can't get there with any amount of stuff and any amount of money and any amount of technology

01:42:52.060 --> 01:42:54.060
A war is complex

01:42:54.540 --> 01:42:59.740
I win they lose that's the solution. How do you get there? I don't know a football game. Look, you like sports

01:42:59.740 --> 01:43:04.380
I like sports. I love barca. I love watching soccer. I love watching spanish premier league soccer

01:43:05.180 --> 01:43:08.620
You know the best days barca wins, but I don't know that's why I watch

01:43:09.100 --> 01:43:12.620
Because it's a complex thing the biggest mistake that we make

01:43:13.340 --> 01:43:19.820
Is thinking and a lot of what we've talked about in this episode comes down to this is thinking that my complex human problems

01:43:19.900 --> 01:43:23.260
Are going to be solved by external complicated solutions

01:43:23.740 --> 01:43:25.740
And that's what the world keeps trying to tell me

01:43:26.300 --> 01:43:33.180
The world says if you take this and you try that and you buy this and you adopt that

01:43:33.900 --> 01:43:36.700
Then you're finally going to be happy and it's not true

01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:39.420
It isn't true. Here's the thing about life

01:43:40.300 --> 01:43:43.660
Life comes down to the complex problems of the heart

01:43:43.980 --> 01:43:48.940
Which are all about love and you can't solve that with a product you can only

01:43:49.740 --> 01:43:52.140
You can only live that in real time

01:43:53.340 --> 01:44:00.460
You want a better life live it in real time be fully alive right now suffer with it experience it

01:44:01.020 --> 01:44:05.660
That's what you have to do. That's what we had to do two million years ago. And that's what we still have to do today

01:44:06.620 --> 01:44:10.460
Hell yeah, Arthur Brooks ladies and gentlemen Arthur is been really great

01:44:10.460 --> 01:44:17.020
I I adore this sort of blend that you have of eastern and western of sort of neuroscience with the mindful with

01:44:17.580 --> 01:44:22.940
It's it's really really great. I'm very very glad that we stopped circling each other and finally managed to sit down

01:44:22.940 --> 01:44:24.700
I look forward to speaking to you again soon as well

01:44:25.260 --> 01:44:28.620
Where should people go? They want to keep up to date with all of the things that you're doing

01:44:28.620 --> 01:44:30.140
Where do you want to send them?

01:44:30.140 --> 01:44:35.340
arthurbrooks.com that gives you you know links that write a column every week in the atlantic on the science of happiness every

01:44:35.340 --> 01:44:39.980
Thursday morning and it has the books and has you know the videos and the workshops a lot of free stuff and

01:44:40.620 --> 01:44:44.300
Surveys and and and clips to my favorite podcast like modern wisdom

01:44:44.780 --> 01:44:50.540
Well, that is the way that I wanted to hear you finish out dude. I really appreciate you. It's been really really great to catch up

01:44:51.180 --> 01:44:57.020
Thanks. Thanks for what you're doing. You've made my life better and you're making millions of people live more mindfully and better in their lives

01:44:57.100 --> 01:44:59.820
